SARS is caused by a newly emerged virus belonging to the coronaviridae family, provisionally termed SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6]. Available sequence data indicate that SARS-CoV is clearly different from all previously known coronaviruses [13]. A new, fourth genetic lineage has been proposed for SARS-CoV [9], although others have suggested it may be an early split-off from the group 2 lineage [16].",

Most cases were the result of direct transmission via respiratory droplets during close personal contact, and adequate respiratory protective measures were shown to be effective [14]. However, there are a number of instances when transmission occurred through other means that are often still not well defined. In the \u201cHotel M\u201d episode, cases occurred in individuals that had never met a SARS-infected individual face-to-face [11]. At the Amoy Gardens high-rise housing estate, transmission probably occurred through SARS-CoV shed in the faeces of a patient [7]. In mainland China, around 50% of probable SARS patients did not have an apparent history of close personal contact with another case [8]. At least a proportion of these cases might have arisen from modes of transmission other than droplets.",

Given their remote relatedness, SARS-CoV may well behave differently from other coronaviruses.

Virus stocks were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Infectious virus titres were determined as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) in confluent cells in 96-well microtitre plates [12].

The addition of FCS had no effect. In the dried state, a gradual loss of infectivity was observed for all four viruses tested. HCoV-229E and HSV-1 were most sensitive and completely lost their infectivity within 72 h, with or without added FCS. This is in agreement with previous studies [15]. In contrast, dried SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for as long as 6 days, with 10% FCS exerting a protective influence throughout. Only after 9 days in a dried state had SARS-CoV completely lost its infectivity. Adenovirus type 3 was the most stable amongst the viruses tested, retaining infectivity as late as day 9, when the experiment was terminated.",
