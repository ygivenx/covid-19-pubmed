            "text": "For sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases, host contact rates have long served as surrogates for individual infectiousness3,12,13,14, leading to the assertion of a general \u201820/80 rule\u2019 (whereby 20% of cases cause 80% of transmission13) and to the influential concept of high-risk \u2018core groups\u20193,12,13. For directly transmitted infections, however, the overall infectiousness of each case\u2014that is, the number of other individuals infected during the infectious lifetime of a single individual\u2014arises from a complex mixture of host, pathogen and environmental factors (see Supplementary Notes). Consequently, the degree of infectiousness is distributed continuously in any population4,7,11,15,16 and, crucially, distinct risk groups often cannot be defined a priori2,11. This impedes the conventional approach to adding heterogeneity to epidemic models, in which populations are divided into homogeneous subgroups2,3,4,17. Research on continuous individual variation in infectiousness for directly transmitted infections has been largely restricted to within-household transmission18,19, or to variation in infectious period20,21 or social network22. Some recent studies have used contact tracing data to investigate specific questions in light of observed variation8,16, but a broad understanding of the role of individual variation in outbreak dynamics is lacking.",

In this framework, superspreading events (SSEs) are not exceptional events9, but important realizations from the right-hand tail of a distribution of \u03bd (refs 7, 15). Stochastic effects in transmission are modelled using a Poisson process4, so that the number of secondary infections caused by each case, Z, is described by an \u2018offspring distribution\u2019 Pr(Z = k) where Z\u223cPoisson(\u03bd).",

Conventional models assuming homogeneity cannot reproduce the observed transmission patterns. For the Singapore outbreak, the maximum-likelihood estimate k\u0302 is 0.16 (90% confidence interval 0.11\u20130.64), indicating an underlying distribution of \u03bd that is highly overdispersed (Fig. 1a, inset).

The Poisson offspring distribution is almost always strongly rejected. The geometric model has considerable support for several data sets, which indicates significant individual variation in transmission rates because real infectious periods are less dispersed than the exponential distribution20,21. The negative binomial model is selected decisively for several data sets, and enables comparative study of diseases through the dispersion parameter. Like SARS, measles in highly vaccinated populations shows high variation in two surveillance data sets, with narrow confidence intervals excluding the conventional models (note that heterogeneous vaccination coverage is an important environmental factor contributing to this pattern). Monkeypox and smallpox viruses show intermediate variation, consistent across multiple data sets, and pneumonic plague transmission is slightly less variable. Data limitations prevent definitive conclusions for other diseases. Comparing our findings to the 20/80 rule proposed for sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases13, no general rule emerges but the core principle of heterogeneous transmission is certainly supported (Fig. 1c).",

A 99th-percentile SSE is then any case causing more infections than would occur in 99% of infectious histories in a homogeneous population (Fig. 1d).

Of primary interest is the probability of stochastic extinction, q, after the introduction of a single infected individual (Fig. 2b). For R0 < 1, all invasions die out, as in standard models. For R0 > 1, increased variation strongly favours extinction8. For example, if R0 = 3 then q = 0.06 under the assumption of homogeneous \u03bd (k \u2192 \u221e), or q = 0.33 if k = 1, but if k = 0.16 (as estimated for SARS) then q = 0.76. Extinction risk rises owing to a higher proportion of non-transmitting cases when \u03bd is overdispersed (Figs 1a, 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). This effect thwarts invasion by diseases that are very potent spreaders on average: for arbitrarily high R0, q \u2192 1 as k \u2192 0 (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The expected number of cases before extinction is hardly affected by k (Supplementary Fig. 2c), because low-k outbreaks that fail probably lacked SSEs and thus resemble homogeneous outbreaks with lower R0. Accordingly, when individual variation is large, extinction occurs rapidly or not at all (Supplementary Fig. 2d).",

Consider the effect of control effort c, where c = 0 reflects no control and c = 1 reflects complete blockage of transmission. Under population-wide control, the infectiousness of every individual in the population is reduced by a factor c (that is,  for all individuals). Under random, individual-specific control, a proportion c of infected individuals (chosen at random) is traced and isolated completely such that they cause zero infections (that is  for a proportion c of infected individuals, and  for the rest). Individual-specific control raises the degree of heterogeneity in the outbreak as measured by the variance-to-mean ratio of Z, whereas population-wide control reduces heterogeneity. Both approaches yield effective reproductive number R = (1 - c)R0, so the threshold control effort for guaranteed disease extinction is c \u2265 1 - 1/R0 as in conventional models. For intermediate values of c, however, the individual-specific approach always works better (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b), consistent with our finding that higher variation favours disease extinction (Fig. 2b).

This increased skew in transmission arose chiefly from undiagnosed or misdiagnosed individuals, who continued to infect others (and even cause SSEs), whereas controlled individuals infected very few. To further examine our control theories, we calculated  and  for each data set; k\u0302c was always closer to , although twice it fell between the two predictions, indicating a possible combination of control mechanisms (Fig. 3b).

Focusing half of all control effort on the most infectious 20% of cases is up to threefold more effective than random control (Fig. 3d). When k = 0.1 or 0.5, outbreak containment is assured for targeted control levels at roughly half the threshold level of c = 1 - 1/R0 for random control. Gains in efficiency increase with more intense targeting of high-\u03bd cases, but saturate as overall coverage c increases (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Again, branching process theory generalizes these findings: for a given proportion c of individuals controlled, greater targeting of higher-\u03bd individuals leads to lower effective reproductive number R and higher extinction probability q (see Supplementary Notes).",

Surveillance data sets are less vulnerable to this bias, but may under-report isolated cases. We urge that detailed transmission tracing data be collected and made public whenever possible, even if unexceptional. At a minimum, we propose a new measure for inclusion in outbreak reports: the proportion of cases not transmitting (p0), which, together with R0 is sufficient to estimate the degree of variation in \u03bd (Supplementary Fig. 4). As more data become available, trends may emerge in the degree of variation present, for example, for different modes of spread or levels of virulence. Richer data sets may also enable testing of the branching process assumption that case outcomes are independent and identically distributed, by detecting possible correlations in \u03bd values within transmission lineages or systematic changes as outbreaks progress.",

Explosive epidemics demand rapid action by authorities and can strain health infrastructures. High extinction probabilities indicate that disease introductions or host species jumps may be more frequent than currently suspected. Cluster-size surveillance for pathogen adaptation29 or dwindling population immunity30 should be tuned to observed levels of variation. Realization of targeted control measures requires a better understanding of factors determining individual infectiousness. This work must be integrated with established theory of sexually transmitted diseases and social networks, where high-risk groups exert nonlinear influence on R0 because contact rates affect infectiousness and susceptibility equally3,4,12,13,22. All diseases probably show intermediate degrees of covariation between infectiousness and susceptibility, a topic demanding empirical and theoretical study17. The central role of R0 in epidemic analysis is unassailable, but our findings show that emerging disease outbreaks cannot be fully understood if individual variation in infectiousness is neglected. Examination of other population processes dependent on small numbers of individuals may yield similar insights.",
