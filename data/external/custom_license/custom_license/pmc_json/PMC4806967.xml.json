In April 2014, PDCoV strain KNU14-04 was reported in pigs in South Korea (6). A retrospective study in 2012 reported PDCoV strain S27 in Sichuan, China (7). Recently PDCoV strain CNJXNI2 has been reported in pigs with diarrhea in Jiangxi, China (8).",

A total of 865 (19.22%) piglets died and were culled during 10 production weeks. Postmortem examination of dead piglets showed emaciated animals and yellow pasty feces. Intestines and colons showed thin walls with a watery content and curdled milk. Histopathologic examination showed shortened and fused villi in the jejunum and ileum. An attenuated and vacuolated cytoplasm in enterocytes was also observed (Technical Appendix Figure 1) (9,10).",
