A sputum sample was collected at the peak of illness and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. Isolation of SARS-CoV was performed with Vero cells maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (D-MEM, BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone, Perbio Science Erembodegem-Aalst, Belgium), penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker), and 2.5 \u03bcg/mL Fungizone (Invitrogen Ltd, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) (complete medium). In detail, an aliquot (0.5 mL) of the sputum sample was mixed with 2 x 106 Vero cell suspension in 2 mL of complete medium. After incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 4 mL of complete medium was added, and the cell suspension was transferred into a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ). Twenty-four hours after inoculation, the cell cultures were examined with an optical microscope for evidence of cytopathic effects (CPE). An aliquot of culture supernatant was collected and stored at \u201380\u00b0C for RT-PCR evaluation. After an additional 24 hours, both the culture supernatant and the cells were collected after 2 cycles of freeze thawing followed by clarification of the thawed contents by centrifugation at 1,000 x g and dispensation of the supernatant into aliquots stored at \u201380\u00b0C (primary viral stock). For generation of the secondary and tertiary viral stocks, adherent Vero cells flasks were seeded in a 25 cm2 tissue culture and injected with 0.5 mL of stored supernatant filtered with 0.45 \u03bc filters. Three days after infection, the cells and supernatant were subjected to 2 cycles of freeze thawing, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation followed by filtration as described above (secondary viral stock). Finally, Vero cells seeded in 2 flasks of 75 cm2 were injected with 1.5 mL of the second passage virus stock in a total volume of 25 mL to generate a third-passage viral stock.",

RNA was purified from 750 \u00b5L of the resulting homogenate by using the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) (elution volume 50 \u03bcL), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Viral RNA was extracted from 0.5 mL of culture supernatant with the same kit (elution volume 50 \u03bcL). cDNA synthesis and subsequent amplification were performed by using either nested RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR approach, as described elsewhere, with minor modifications (3). In brief, 5 \u03bcL of extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed for 30 min at 42\u00b0C by using Mo-MuLV RT, a mixture of random hexamers, and an oligo-(dT) primer. Two microliters of the synthesized cDNA was subsequently amplified by using the following primers pairs: outer primers: BNI-OUTS2, 5\u2032-ATG AAT TAC CAA GTC AAT GGT TAC-3\u2032; BNI-OUTAS, 5\u2032-CAT AAC CAG TCG GTA CAG CTA C-3\u2032; inner primers: BNI-INS, 5\u2032-GAA GCT ATT CGT CAC GTT CG,-3\u2032; BNI\u00adINAS, 5\u2032-CTG TAG AAA ATC CTA GCT GGA G-3\u2032. A sequence of the SARS-CoV RNA encompassing the target region was used as positive control, and a sputum sample from a SARS-negative healthy donor and a feline coronavirus RNA extract were used as negative controls. The amplified PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis visualized by ethidium bromide staining and sequenced directly on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer with ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator v3.0 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). SARS-CoV was then identified by searching for homologies between the amplified fragment and previously deposited sequences using BLAST. Finally, the quantitation of the viral RNA was performed in a TaqMan assay after generation of cDNA. The primer pair and probe BNITMSARS1, 5\u2032-TTATCACCCGCGAAGAAGCT-3\u2032; BNITMSARAS2, 5\u2032-CTCTAGTTGCATGACAGCCCTC-3\u2032, BNI-TMSARP 6-carboxifluorescein-TCG TGC GTG GAT TGG CTT TGA TGT-6 carboxy-tetramethylrhodamin (3) were added to the universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) at 200 and 120 nM, respectively, in a final volume of 25 \u03bcL. The standard was obtained by cloning the 77-bp fragment into the pCR2.1 plasmid by using the TA cloning kit (InVitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). A linear distribution (r = 0.99) was obtained between 101 to 108 copies.",

A 5\u2032 rapid amplification of PCR ends (RACE) technique was performed to capture the 5\u2032-untranslated region of the genome (10). Each 750-bp fragment was gel-isolated by means of a QIAQuick gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and directly sequenced from both directions inward and outward. SeqScape version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) software was used for base calling, editing, and assembly of the fragments. Manual check of the differences between the electropherograms and the reference sequence (Urbani isolate) was performed and eventually led to reamplification or resequencing of some fragments. The complete sequence of SARS-CoV HSR1 strain was aligned with all the previously sequenced full-length genomes available from the GenBank database by using ClustalW and editing with BioEdit version 5.0.9 for manual corrections. Available full-length sequences of SARS-CoV strains accessed from GenBank and used for phylogenetic analysis and genotyping were as follows: Taiwan TC2 (AY338175), Taiwan TC1 (AY338174), TWC (AY321118), Sin2774 (AY283798), Sin2748 (AY283797), Sin2679 (AY283796), Sin2677 (AY283795), Sin2500 (AY283794), Frankfurt 1 (AY291315), BJ04 (AY279354), BJ03 (AY278490), BJ02 (AY278487), GZ01 (AY278489), CUHK-W1 (AY278554), ZJ01 (AY297028), TOR2 (AY274119), TW1 (AY291451), CUHK\u00adSu10 (AY282752), BJ01 (AY278488), Urbani (AY278741), and HKU-39849 (AY278491).

The viral load in the sample was estimated to be 5.6 x 104 SARS-CoV RNA copies/mL. Twenty-four hours after injection of Vero cells with the sputum sample, a strong CPE was observed, as indicated in Figure 1B. The CPE was diffused with cell rounding with refractive appearance, and the cell monolayer was destroyed as compared to control uninfected Vero cells (Figure 1A). The viral load in the culture supernatant 24 hours after injection with the clinical sample was 1.3 x 105 copies/mL as determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Serial passage of the virus on Vero cells to obtain a tertiary viral stock yielded 9.1 x 108 copies/mL. A plaque assay was optimized to determine the in vitro infectivity of SARS-CoV. The tertiary viral stock tested 2.5 x 106 PFU/mL in the plaque assay, suggesting that about 360 genomes were required to generate a single plaque in tissue cultures, at least under the conditions described here. We also used the plaque assay for testing the potential inhibitory effect on virus infectivity of a single concentration of heparin, the prototypic compound of a class of inhibitors of virus entry for enveloped viruses including HIV type 1 (HIV-1) (14) and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and 2) (15). Heparin indeed reduced the formation of plaques by 50% when added 30 min before infection of Vero cells with 100 PFU/mL of the SARS-CoV (Figure 2).",

We identified the major open reading frames (ORFs), coding for the 4 major structural proteins, namely: spike (S), envelope (E) matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N) gene products, and at least other 10 proteins, including a few of unknown function. The complete sequence of SARS-CoV strain HSR1 has been deposited in the GenBank database (GenBank accession no. AY323977). This sequence was aligned with those of the other 21 SARS-CoV isolates to facilitate phylogenetic analysis. Overall, the mean difference in nucleotide composition between all the isolates was 18 \u00b1 1 nt variations within the whole genomes, thus confirming the genetic conservation observed previously (9). On the whole, 149 sites were variable among the 22 aligned isolates, and 24 loci in the viral genome varied in more than one isolate, including in the SARS-CoV HSR1 genome (recurrent mutations). Eleven of 24 recurrent mutations were silent, whereas 3 of 13 mutations generating amino acid substitutions were observed within the N-terminal domain of the spike glycoprotein gene (positions 21,722, 22,223, and 22,423, determining a G to D, an I to T, and a G to R amino acid change, respectively). Six mutations were detected in the replicase gene (positions 8,572, 9,404, 9,479, 9,854, 17,564, and 19,084, determining a V to L, a V to A, a V to A, an A to V, a D to E, and a T to I amino acid change, respectively), and 1 mutation was found in the matrix protein (position 26,600, determining an A to V amino acid change). The phylogenetic analysis was also performed by using the maximum parsimony method, considering only sequence variants that recurred in more than one strain in order to reduce the mutational noise caused by PCR or sequencing mistakes. Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic tree obtained with the maximum likelihood method. The maximum parsimony trees produced the same structure with minor changes in the subtrees\u2019 branch patterns (data not shown). In these analyses, SARS-CoV HSR1 appears to be strongly related to strains isolated from patients who had traveled from Hong Kong to different geographic areas (Singapore, Canada, Vietnam) and spread the infection to their home countries in a few cases.",

Major areas of research include the following: 1) analyzing growth characteristics of SARS-CoV in vitro; 2) evaluating virus-host relationships at the molecular level; 3) understanding both SARS-CoV genome organization and the role of nonstructural proteins of unknown function; 4) studying the evolutionary relationships of different coronaviruses of animal and human origin; and 5) identifying targets for anti-CoV chemotherapy and vaccination. In our study, we characterized a novel isolate of SARS-CoV (designated HSR1 strain). The analysis of the complete sequence of SARS-CoV HSR1 genome showed the same organization in ORFs previously described in this novel human virus (10) and confirmed the relative genetic stability among the different isolates (9). However, for other SARS-CoVs isolates, amino acid changes were observed in this HSR1 strain at the level of the N-terminal domain of the spike glycoprotein, the viral replicase, and the matrix protein. Despite this relative stability, phylogenetic analysis of the HSR1 isolate (Figure 4) has shown that the virus is more related to the strains isolated in patients who had traveled from Hong Kong to different geographic areas, such as Singapore, Canada, and Vietnam, than to the Beijing isolates. In addition, we have observed that other biomolecular features shared by most Coronaviridae coexist in SARS-CoV HSR1 with particular characteristics that seem to be unique of the novel virus. In particular, SARS-CoV is able to replicate in Vero cells with a rapid production of high virus titers and fast CPE. By using quantitative molecular and biologic assays, we could estimate that, under our experimental conditions, 360 genomes are approximately required to form a plaque of infectivity in vitro. SARS-CoV seems unlike most of the other respiratory coronaviruses infecting humans, which fail to grow efficiently in tissue cultures and are easily detectable by using PCR amplification methods only (17). Infection in Vero cells showed most of the usual characteristics of the CoV replication (16), including intracellular budding of virions, as demonstrated by electron microscopy.",

Incubation of Vero cells with heparin (100 \u03bcg/mL) 30 min before SARS-CoV injection curtailed infection by 50%. Polyanions have demonstrated antiviral activity (18) against enveloped viruses such as HIV and HSV through specific interaction with cells and after inhibition of virus attachment and entry (14). Heparin, a prototypic polyanion, inhibits attachment and entry of virus particles into cell by impeding the interaction of the V3 region of gp120 with HIV specific chemokine coreceptor (19). In the case of HSV, heparin inhibits the interaction of some HSV envelope glycoprotein to the heparan sulfate that mediates viral attachment to the target cell surface (20,21). The partial inhibition of SARS-CoV HSR1 by heparin suggests that the envelope proteins coating the SARS-CoV virions might be endowed with positively charged amino acids that could interact with negatively charged sulfate groups present on heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on the surface of target cells. Vero cells, the target of both HSV and dengue 4 (22) replication, replicate SARS-CoV more efficiently than several other cell lines.",

The sequence analysis indicates that SARS-CoV HSR1 clusters together with the Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada isolates. The coexistence of general coronavirus features with important biologic and molecular specificity of SARS-CoV, together with the evidence that SARS-CoV does not appear to be linked to any of the other three genetic groups of known coronaviruses, strongly suggests it represents a new, fourth genetic coronavirus group, with distinct genomic and biologic features. In light of this evidence, efforts to identify new types of animal coronaviruses as well as to better understand the peculiarities of SARS-CoV are important in addressing its possible animal origin and in understanding the biology of Coronaviridae and their evolutionary features.",
