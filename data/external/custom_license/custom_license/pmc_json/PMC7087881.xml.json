PAMPs are highly conserved structures present in large groups of microorganisma, for instance, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA). PRRs are present in soluble forms like mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and in form of transmembraneous or intracellular molecules that directly mediate cellular immune responses. These cell-bound receptors include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and cytosolic DNA receptors. PRRs are expressed by alveolar macrophages, lung epithelial cells and dendritic cells responsible for the first reactions to invading pathogens (Bals and Hiemstra 2004; Opitz et al. 2010). Relevant respiratory pathogens causing different types of pneumonia or exacerbations of asthma and COPD are listed in Table 1.\n\n",

The cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor homology (TIR) domain is responsible for downstream signaling via TIR adaptor molecules whereas the extracellular leucinerich repeat (LRR) domain most likely mediates ligand binding. TLRs are located either at the cell surface (TLR1, 2, 4-6, 10) or in intracellular lysosomal/endosomal membranes (TLR3, 7\u20139). In the lung, several host cells including macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), lung epithelial and endothelial cells express TLRs. Different combinations of TLRs can be found on different respiratory cells (see also Table 2) and the simultaneous activation of several TLRs might lead to a more pathogen-specific immune response (Bals and Hiemstra 2004; Krishnan et al. 2007; Knuefermann et al. 2007). TLR activation by microbial pathogens can also lead to increased TLR expression on the surface of the stimulated cell such as H. influenzae upregulates TLR2-expression on bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 1a, b). This is important to know since unstimulated epithelial cells show a weak expression of TLR (Imasato et al. 2002).\n\n\n",

TLR2 recognizes lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from a variety of Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria as well as from mycobacteria and fungi. After activation, TLR2 forms a heterodimer with TLR6 or TLR1 to recognize (responding to a different panel of lipoproteins) diacyl and triacyl lipopeptides. TLR2 binds to zymosan, a particle of yeast cell wall components, peptidoglycan, a component of the Gram-positive bacteria cell wall, and Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 hydrochloride (Pam3Cys), a lipohexapeptide analog of the immunologically active N-terminal portion of bacterial lipoprotein (Chaudhuri et al. 2005; Henning et al. 2008). The enhanced expression of TLR2 at the protein level and the increased expression of TLR2 on the cell surface leads to remarkable induction of mRNA expression for IL-6 and CXCL-8 and after stimulation with PGN. These gene products and others are known to be important for innate immune responses and host defense reactions, upregulated TLR2 in respiratory epithelial cells may consequently enhance the antimicrobial responses of the host (Homma et al. 2004; Reppe et al. 2009).",

LPS is bound by LPS-binding protein (LBP), an acute phase protein produced by liver cells and epithelial cells in the lung. LBP transfers LPS to CD14, to constitute the TLR4 complex together with the extracellular protein MD-2. Activation of the TLR4 receptor complex by the recognition of LPS is followed by intracellular signal transduction including the adaptor molecule MyD88 and leading to the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (Wieland et al. 2005; Janardhan et al. 2006). The regulation of TLR4 expression on the cell surface of bronchial epithelium and alveolar macrophages is discussed controversially (Saito et al. 2005). In addition to LPS, TLR4 also recognizes pneumolysin (PLN), an intracellular toxin found as an important virulence factor in S. pneumoniae. Interaction of TLR4 and PLN leads to enhanced cytokine production and thus to the elimination of the pathogen from the respiratory tract (Dessing et al. 2008).",

NACHT proteins lack a TIR domain, but in contrast to TLRs include an N-terminal caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD) or a PYRIN domain that links bacterial pattern recognition to other effector proteins, such as procaspase-1 and the I\u03ba-kinase-binding protein RIP2/CARDIAK. Caspase-1 and RIP2/CARDIAK are necessary for the activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL-1\u03b2 and for the induction of NF-\u03baB. The activation of NACHT family proteins is thought to involve oligomerization via their corresponding NACHT domains, triggered by binding of specific pathogen-derived molecules to the LRRs (Damiano et al. 2004).",

They are mainly synthesized in the human lung in type II alveolar epithelial cells and Clara cells and are secreted into the alveolar space as the main constituent of the pulmonary surfactant. They interact with a variety of carbohydrates and glycolipids and are also able to recognize a wide range of respiratory pathogens like P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, A. fumigatus, and P. jiroveci (Pastva et al. 2007). The surfactant proteins either function as opsonins linking pathogens to receptors on phagocytic cells or cause aggregation of pathogens. SP-A, for example, can also increase the expression of scavenger receptor A (SR-A). SR-A recognizes conserved bacterial structures like modified lipoproteins, LTA or LPS, and is thus a binding receptor for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Amiel et al. 2009; Platt and Gordon 2001) leading to an enhanced bacterial uptake by the phagocytic cell (Kuronuma et al. 2004).",

In addition, activation of the inflammasome by DAMPs might be another mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of COPD. Inhaled toxic agents, oxidative stress, infections, necrotic cell death, as well as hypoxia, hypercapnia, focal hypoperfusion and tissue acidification might lead to release of DAMPs (e.g., uric acid, ATP) by damaged lung tissue which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Uric acid concentrations were increased in broncho-alveolar fluids of COPD patients and smokers. Furthermore, COPD patients showed significantly reduced concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 antagonists compared with controls (Opitz et al. 2010).",

Pneumococcal DNA was found in 80\u201390% of the AM and only 15\u201330% of AEC, whereas bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) were only sporadically infected.

As described by Didierlaurent et al. impaired immune responses to bacterial infections, including desensitization to TLR signals, can be observed after infections with influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus. Although such desensitization may be beneficial for prevention of overwhelming immune responses, the reduced neutrophil recruitment might contribute to severe secondary bacterial pneumonia. The influence of PRRs on epithelial cells and immune cells is also very important in allergic lung diseases which has recently been summarized (Lloyd and Murdoch 2010).",

Recognition of invading pathogens and cell injury-associated endogenous molecules by pattern recognition receptors expressed on phagocytes and epithelial cells lead to a differentiated immune reaction. Acute inflammatory reactions are supposed to eliminate the pathogen, but also implicate tissue destruction. Therefore, PRR-mediated signaling pathways are critical for the balance between host protection and tissue homeostasis. Considering this key role in infectious and non-infectious lung diseases therapeutic approaches, targeting this system should be strengthened. Many details have been characterized recently on the innate immune system. However, several details are so far only known for experimental animals (mostly mice) and have to be studied in the human lung in future.",
