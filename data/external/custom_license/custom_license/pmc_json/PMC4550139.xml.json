Additionally, cases include ill persons from whom GAS is isolated from a wound or other tissue in the presence of necrotizing fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

Efforts at most sites to make ABCs pathogens reportable to state public health agencies have facilitated participation of almost all laboratories (\u2248600) that serve the surveillance population. Because the population under surveillance is well-defined, US Census data are used to calculate disease incidence rates within the ABCs population.

ABCs also identified increased incidence of IPD for serotypes not found in PCV7; particularly serotype 19A. These findings contributed to the accelerated approval of PCV13, which includes serotype 19A, and the recommendation for its use in children <5 years of age.

Without evidence as to which strategy was better, the 1996 guidelines recommended that health care providers could use either a screening or risk-based approach to decide which women should receive prophylaxis during delivery. An ABCs-based cohort study that sampled from a population of \u2248600,000 live-born infants at 8 sites demonstrated the value of screening over the risk-based approach. Specifically, universal prenatal screening of pregnant women for vaginal/rectal colonization with GBS and providing antimicrobial drugs during delivery to those who were colonized was \u224850% more effective at preventing early onset GBS than providing prophylaxis to pregnant women on the basis of certain risk factors (8). This finding led to issuance of new guidelines in 2002 (9) and revised guidelines in 2010 (10), which resulted in further reductions in disease. Since the early 1990s, ABCs has documented a >80% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS infection and prevention of an estimated 70,000 cases of early-onset GBS infection (Figure 3).",

Most (\u224884%) infections were health care\u2013associated\u2014either hospital-onset (culture obtained >3 days after admission) or health care\u2013associated community-onset (culture obtained from outpatient or within 3 calendar days after admission from a patient with a health care\u2013associated risk factor, which include presence of a central venous catheter within 2 days before MRSA culture or history of surgery, hospitalization, dialysis, or residence of long-term care facility in the 12 months preceding culture date). The prominence of health care\u2013associated community-onset infections was newly brought to light by the ABCs network (16). This report led to increased awareness of MRSA infections, and prevention of health care\u2013associated MRSA became a goal for public health agencies and policy makers (17\u201319). ABCs documented a 54% decline in hospital-onset MRSA and a 28% decline in health care\u2013associated community-onset MRSA invasive infections during 2005\u20132011 (Figure 4) (20). An ABCs-based study evaluating risk factors for health care\u2013associated community-onset MRSA infections has just been completed. Despite great progress in reducing health care\u2013associated MRSA infections, rates of invasive MRSA infections in the community among persons without recent health care exposures (community-associated infections) remain largely unchanged, indicating the ongoing need for prevention strategies outside hospital settings (Figure 4) (20).",

Increasing resistance of GBS isolates to clindamycin discovered through ABCs prompted a 2002 change in the second-line prophylaxis recommendation for intrapartum women, from clindamycin to cefazolin for penicillin-allergic women at low risk for anaphylaxis (9). Two reports of vancomycin-resistant GBS isolates (1 inside and 1 outside the ABCs catchment area) have recently been published (24). Although apparently not widespread, vancomycin resistance is a concerning development that must be closely monitored because it is an alternative agent for prophylaxis in penicillin-allergic patients at high risk for anaphylaxis (10).",

These comprehensive data enable accurate estimations of the national disease burden for severe bacterial infections under surveillance. The collection of isolates in conjunction with epidemiologic data has contributed to the microbiological and molecular characterization of pathogens, which has played a part in the development of vaccines and monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance. Although the surveillance system alone provides powerful data for informing public health actions, the large ABCs infrastructure provides an efficient and effective platform for engaging in special investigations that would otherwise require additional resources. The infrastructure also provides the flexibility needed to respond to emergencies and to serve as a surveillance platform for other emerging pathogens. Perhaps the greatest strength of ABCs and the reason for its success have been the committed, genial, and long-lasting collaboration among local, state, and federal agencies, academic institutions, and clinical laboratories.",
