This last point has been particularly relevant over the past several years as emerging viral outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses and others have quickly led to large sequencing efforts. There was a clear need to support these sequencing efforts with bioinformatics resources, but timelines prevented traditional development paths where new virus modules and features were added over the course of months. The first rapid deployment of a Virus Variation module was during the western African Ebola virus outbreak that began in December of 2013. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on August 8, 2014 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en/). By September, a Virus Variation Resource specific to Ebolaviruses was available to help access the sequences that had begun to pour into the INSDC databases. Similarly, a Virus Variation Resource module was developed in September 2014 in response to the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most recently, this rapid response model was repeated for the Zika virus module, which was put in place in March 2016. This need-based deployment strategy is likely a model for future efforts, and much of our current development is geared toward harmonizing processes and interfaces among individual data and software modules so as to provide more support for more virus species within the resource and to respond more efficiently to emergent large-scale sequencing efforts.",

This step confirms species taxonomy, identifies segment assignment if applicable and provides information about the lineage, genotype, type or subtype. The references used are listed in Table 3, and sequences that fail to match a reference within established metrics are pushed to a curation interface where they can be reviewed manually.",

The first pipeline uses a reference protein guided approach based on the Prosplign tool as described previously (8,13,18). Here, protein reference sequences are aligned with potential translations of the query sequence. The highest scoring translation alignment to any protein reference is then chosen and parsed to determine that it meets specific criteria \u2013 the presence of a start codon, exact matches to mature peptide cleavage sites or premature stop sites. Post transcriptional and translational exceptions can be accounted for by this tool by adjusting parameters and allowing multiple transitions from different open reading frames to be assembled into a single alignment. One advantage of this approach is that new viruses can be incorporated by adding new reference protein sequences and adjusting the criteria used for validating a particular translation. Such was the case for Zika virus annotation where the existing dengue virus pipeline was updated with new Zika virus reference sequences (see Table 3).",

Here, there was a need to quickly develop a pipeline that could validate the annotation on GenBank records and assign consistent gene and protein names so that these could be accurately used as search criteria. To accomplish this, a BLAST-based pipeline was developed that compares genes and proteins as annotated on GenBank records to reference proteins derived from the best reference nucleotide match. If a protein matches the reference sequence with >70% identity as measured by BLASTP then the presence of this protein is stored. Genes are validated in the same manner using BLASTN and reference nucleotide sequences. Sequences with genes and proteins that cannot be validated are pushed to the curation interface where they can be manually examined. Ultimately these approaches support both search and analysis functionality but are not capable of generating standardized annotation across all sequences belonging to a particular virus.",

            "text": "Our experience has emphasized the importance of accurate annotation pipelines that can be applied to new viruses rapidly in response to emergent needs. Though our current pipelines are effective, they are also very specific to particular viruses and application to new viruses requires much work developing reference sequences, defining processing parameters and manually reviewing annotation results. With that in mind we are now implementing a new, third approach to annotation that can be adapted rapidly when needed and is scalable to multiple virus groups. This new approach is built around two important considerations. First, it uses annotations contained within the so-call Reference Sequence records (19) that are created by our group to represent important taxonomic and sequence space groups. The nucleotide and protein sequences within these records can be invaluable for the unambiguous assignment of sequences to defined groups and can also serve as repositories of reference sequence feature annotation maintained by in-house curation efforts often in collaboration with other scientists (20\u201324). Second, this approach includes a comprehensive list of error flags that provide extensive information about sequences and can provide warnings about potential problems. This error coding not only allows staff to quickly sort through thousands of annotations during the development of new pipelines, but also provides potential criteria for the selection or filtering of sequences to resource users.",

            "text": "This new approach was used to annotate polyprotein and mature peptide genomic intervals in West Nile virus (WNV), and this annotation will be available soon through the Virus Variation Resource. These annotations were calculated as follows: First, GenBank West Nile sequences were classified as one of the two common lineages of WNV (lineage 1 or lineage 2) using a combination of BLASTN (25) against the two RefSeq sequences and expert knowledge. The principal characteristic that distinguishes lineage 1 from lineage 2 is that the additional protein WARF4 occurs only in lineage 1 WNV genomes and is believed to occur in most of them (7). There is some evidence that a small proportion of WNV genomes do not fit neatly into lineage 1 or lineage 2 (7), but these were classified as lineage 2 in our annotations. Second, the annotation pipeline built a covariance model (CM) for each of 16 mature peptides present in the NC_009942 RefSeq annotation and for the 15 mature peptides in the NC_001563 RefSeq. The CMs are built using the cmbuild program of the Infernal homology search software package (26). Infernal is typically used for modeling the sequence and secondary structure of RNAs, and because the sequences we are modeling lack structure (i.e. basepairs between positions), the CMs we created are effectively identical to sequence-only profile hidden Markov models. In the current version of our pipeline, each model was derived from the single RefSeq nucleotide sequence encoding each mature peptide. Third, the CMs built from the RefSeq to which that genome was assigned were used to predict each mature peptide coding sequence using Infernal's cmscan program.",

            "text": "The annotation software then runs a variety of validation checks and produces error codes that assist in curation of sequences. For example, the pipeline checks for the existence of any in-frame stop codons within the predicted regions. If one or more is found, the prediction boundaries are modified to terminate at the 5\u2032-most stop found. Coding sequence (CDS) coordinates are determined implicitly based on the predicted mature peptide coordinates. Lineage 1 (NC_009942) has three CDSs and lineage 2 (NC_001563) has two CDSs. For each CDS, the predictions for the corresponding mature peptides that make up each CDS are tested for consistency by ensuring that mature peptide coding sequences that are adjacent (separated by 0 nucleotides) in the RefSeq are also adjacent in the predictions. The start position of the first mature peptide and end position of the final mature peptide that comprise each CDS are then used as the start and stop position for that CDS. CDS annotations are not made if the mature peptide consistency check fails. In addition to checking for early stop codons and the adjacency of mature peptide coding sequences, the annotation pipeline identifies other unusual or unexpected features in each sequence and reports those as \u2018error codes\u2019. There are 17 possible error codes, which provide an easy way for users to gauge the quality of each sequence and its annotations, and should facilitate the selection of subsets of the sequence data that meet specific user-defined quality standards. A more detailed description of the new annotation pipeline and error flags will be included in full detail eventually in a separate manuscript, as well as in the help documents available at the Virus Variation Resource.",

To resolve this issue, the Virus Variation database loading pipeline parses GenBank records, identifies important metadata terms, such as sample isolation host, date, country and source, and maps these to a standardized vocabulary using a hierarchical approach. For example, isolation host terms are first identified in the host field and failing that, then isolate or strain fields, then isolation source, note and finally organism name.",

For human pathogens isolation source often refers to a host tissue or bodily fluid, and the Virus Variation vocabulary mapping strategy attempts to combine similar clinical terms into biologically relevant groups. For example, the parsed terms \u2018serum,\u2019 \u2018plasma\u2019 and \u2018lymphocytes\u2019 are all mapped to the standardized vocabulary term \u2018blood\u2019. To support more efficient data retrieval, host terms are mapped in a hierarchy, and once a species term such as \u2018Accipiter cooperii\u2019 is identified, it is mapped to both the group name \u2018Bird\u2019 and the common name \u2018Accipiter.\u2019",

Disease terms for dengue virus are also found using a similar strategy. In all cases these strategies require extensive examination of sequence records and documentation of specific terms that can be accurately mapped to controlled vocabulary gleaned from established ontologies such as the Environmental Ontology (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ENVO) and the Infectious Disease Ontology (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/IDO). This process is supported by a curation interface that lists records where parsing fails to identify expected terms, leading to good old-fashioned manual curation and the identification of new terms, common misspellings, regional spelling differences and the manual incorporation of metadata from relevant literature into the Virus Variation database. In total, these vocabulary remapping strategies can have a profound impact on data usability as large numbers of parsed terms can be mapped to controlled vocabularies (Table 4).",

Our plan is to increase the pace at which new virus species are added to the Virus Variation Resource, and we are currently developing layers of data processing \u2013 the least transformative of which could be applied across all viral sequences but still provide basic information about a sequence.

However, the vast majority of viruses do not have strong experimental evidence for protein coding regions, making it difficult to build a Virus Variation module including an annotation pipeline. In these cases annotation will need to be inferred from related, experimentally studied viruses, requiring new approaches and better ways of standardizing gene and protein information across multiple groups of viruses. Our current annotation pipeline development is directed toward these goals, and we intend to extend public access to these pipelines beyond our current influenza virus module. We also intend to reveal resource-derived annotation as tracks on multiple sequence alignments, making annotated sequences available for download and improving access to our data sets. This will also enable users to limit downloads and multiple sequence alignments to selected mature peptides for polyprotein sequences, and trees to be built from selected genomic regions.",
