            "text": "Viral syndromes are often implicated as probable triggers for autoimmune diseases. Studies in pediatric cohorts also support this association in acute glomerulopathies. A prospective Canadian study linked 71 % of nephrotic syndrome (NS) exacerbations to a specific viral respiratory infection [1]. In that study, 32 children with NS were followed over two winters, with repeated cultures and daily urinalyses. Within 10 days of many of the relapses, infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, varicella or adenovirus were detected. Similarly, in a prospective cohort of ten children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), eight had evidence of adenovirus or enterovirus infection, and the other two had culture-positive family contacts [2]. Although no single strain of virus has been definitively shown to cause any specific renal pathology, several glomerular diseases are linked to infection or host antiviral responses. Most of these association studies are dated and involve small numbers of patients. A re-examination of these associations is warranted now that newer molecular diagnostics are available, many glomerular disease classifications have been revised and vaccines have changed the patterns of viral infection. Ultimately, pediatric nephrologists may find that outcomes of viral-associated glomerulopathies differ significantly from those of the truly idiopathic forms.",

Although only a fraction of these species are known to infect humans, the number of human viral pathogens continues to increase (Table 1). Viruses in general are polytropic, affecting several tissues or organ systems. Kidney cells often are infected during viral illnesses but appear to be unusually resistant to injury compared to other organs and tissues. Both viruria and viremia are often measurable during viral syndromes. Human kidney cells have commonly been used to culture several viruses in the laboratory, including adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Coxsackievirus, measles and varicella viruses [3]. The kidneys rarely bear the brunt of infection, either from cytotoxic effects or the host antiviral responses, which is in contrast to viral arthritis, hepatitis, meningitis, otitis, pharyngitis, pericarditis, pneumonitis and tonsillitis, to name a few. When kidney infection leads to kidney injury, it may be indistinguishable from that of non-infectious etiologies.\n",

            "text": "There are several mechanisms by which viral syndromes can lead to glomerulopathy. Direct infection of glomerular cells can cause cytopathic injury. Like any filterable blood-borne substance, viral particles (diameter 5\u2013300 nm) can become trapped in the glomerular filtration apparatus, leading to in situ immune complex (IC) formation. Viruses can be an antigenic stimulus for the immune system, leading to autoimmunity against cross-reactive glomerular cell epitopes [4]. Alternatively, direct infection may modify either a tissue antigen or a cellular immune response to evoke autoimmunity [5]. Viral infections of the kidney could lead to chronic nephropathy by a variety of mechanisms, including reactivation of latent virus in glomerular cells resulting in recurrent insults to kidney cells.",

            "text": "Establishing a viral associated-glomerulopathy requires diagnostic evidence of viral infection, along with clinical or pathologic evidence of kidney injury, either by histopathology, viral culture or evidence of viral replication by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This is not a simple task and has not been performed adequately in many of the case reports or cohort studies of kidney involvement during viral syndromes. Albuminuria and erythrocyturia occur non-specifically in many febrile diseases and do not alone establish glomerular injury. Viruria or inclusion-bearing cells in the urine can be either a cause or an effect of glomerular injury, or may simply reflect glomerular trapping during viremia. Some viruses are commensal in the kidney and may be shed harmlessly. While polyoma viruses (BK and JC viruses) are known to infect tubular and, rarely, glomerular epithelial cells in the kidney, and to cause interstitial nephritis and, rarely, crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) in transplanted kidneys, there are no reported cases of these viruses infecting glomerular cells or causing glomerulopathy in native kidneys, even in immunosuppressed patients.",

            "text": "If a particular virus does actually cause glomerulopathy, the viruria could occur in the prodromal period, during the illness, in convalescence or indefinitely. On biopsy, viral infection can be determined by identifying inclusion-bearing cells, detecting viral replication by PCR (for DNA viruses, see Table 1) or reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (for RNA viruses) or culturing virus from unfixed specimens. Cellular inclusions are non-specific, and similar bodies can appear in the urine during non-viral infections and in healthy individuals. Proper controls should be used when performing immunostaining for antiviral antibodies, and tests can be falsely negative if epitopes are hidden by endogenous antibody binding. Serological antibody data can also be misleading. In systemic autoimmune diseases, non-specific immune activation may lead to elevations of antiviral antibody titers [6]. Screening total immunoglobulin titers can be helpful in this regard. In contrast, absorption of pathogenic antiviral antibodies in glomeruli may deplete levels of detectable antibody in the circulation, leading to a falsely negative test. Therefore, measuring antibody titers alone should not be taken as proof for the presence or absence of a viral-associated glomerulopathy.",

Pediatric cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-nephropathy will not be included, as these have become rare in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy and have recently been reviewed [7]. A comprehensive review has already been published in Pediatric Nephrology on viral nephropathies in immunosuppressed kidney transplant patients [8]. However, systematic investigations of viral infection in children or adults with glomerular diseases , comparable to the analyses of the microbiome that are being pursued, are still lacking in the literature. Until such an approach can be devised, the importance of identifying viral infections in managing glomerular disease will remain uncertain.",

Chronic active infection leads to cryoglobulinemia in 40\u201360 % of adults, and the prevalence increases with the duration of the hepatitis. The virus induces a lymphoproliferative disorder of antibody-producing cells which drives the IC disease and results in a systemic inflammatory syndrome. The cryoglobulinemia presents with Meltzer\u2019s triad of purpura, arthralgias and weakness. Hypocomplementemia is common, with a more predominant depletion of C4 due to activation of the classical pathway. Among adult patients with cryoglobulinemia, 33 % have kidney involvement, many with MPGN [33]. Despite the well-established connection between HCV, cryoglobulins and glomerular disease in adults, there has been a paucity of reported cases in children [31], possibly because it takes decades for chronic infections to induce the production of circulating cryoglobulins at levels sufficiently high to trigger tissue injury. Two pediatric cases in Japan were reported without cryoglobulins, with one patient 2 years into interferon therapy (Table 5).",

Kidney biopsy of HSV glomerulopathy showed mesangial cytomegaly, osmiophilic mesangial deposits and typical intranuclear viral particles that were detected adjacent to regions of segmental sclerosis and podocyte foot process fusion. Segmental mesangial IgM and C3 deposition co-localized to areas of HSV antigen. Occasionally, viral inclusions have been described in either nuclei or cytoplasm of glomerular endothelial cells in CMV-associated disease, and localized to necrotizing lesions [48]. PCR of biopsy tissue has detected CMV [49] and parvovirus B19 DNA [13], along with tubular abnormalities resembling HIV-associated nephropathy. Fixed deposits and positive immunostaining for IgM have been described in HAV infection. Using PCR, simian polyomavirus SV-40 has been identified in biopsy tissue and urinary cells in adults with FSGS [50], suggesting a possible role of occult polyoma virus infection in NS onset or progression in some patients.

Prior to routine vaccination, HBV accounted for up to 40\u201390 % of all pediatric MN cases in these cohorts. Immunosuppression is a risk factor. The clinical presentation of viral-associated MN is similar to idiopathic MN, although hypocomplementemia, cryoglobulinemia or circulating IC have been detected.

A few patients had persistent asymptomatic proteinuria, but progressive renal failure was rare. The course of disease is unrelated to persistence of HBsAg, but recovery of renal injury is associated with development of antibodies to HBeAg. KDIGO guidelines recommend antiviral therapy for HBV infection and MN with interferon alpha or nucleoside analogs, with dosing adjusted to the degree of renal function [35]. In most reported cases of HBV-associated MN, the NS resolves with clearance of viremia. Corticosteroid treatment has been ineffective in pediatric cohorts of HBV-associated MN and may inadvertently delay seroconversion to anti-HBe status. In refractory cases, cyclosporine has been effective in achieving remission. Gancyclovir has resulted in full remission of proteinuria and hematuria in cases of MN and CMV.",

Case reports of spontaneous recovery challenge the notion that all glomerular lesions warrant immunomodulatory treatment regardless of viral infection status. Some common viruses associated with glomerulopathies, such as varicella, influenza and HBV, are preventable by vaccination. For reporting future cases on viral-associated GN, investigators should include renal biopsy with ultrastructural analysis, assessment of viral infection of kidney tissue and temporal association between infection, specific antibody responses and disease course. Increasing antibody titers, in situ hybridization and blood and urine cultures can be confirmatory, but may simply identify a chronic infection or carrier state. Additional prospective studies similar to the Nephrovir study should be performed to address the role of emerging viruses. It is clear that viral syndromes act as a trigger for NS onset and relapse, but when this is the case it may be important to discriminate between primary and secondary forms of glomerulopathy.",
