However, all of the ducks sampled were adults of market age, and it is possible that they had already been exposed to influenza viruses early in life and therefore may have developed some immunity to the circulating viruses. Screening for anti\u2010influenza A antibodies in these species would have helped to clarify this, but this was beyond the scope of our surveillance project.",

Although this method has high sensitivity and specificity for detection of type A influenza matrix gene, we may have missed some infections; in one study, virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs was found to detect an additional 2\u00b73% of specimens that were negative by rt RT\u2010PCR.\n27\n The authors attributed the reduced sensitivity of rt RT\u2010PCR in part to the presence of rt RT\u2010PCR inhibitory substances in the samples and the less volume used in rt RT\u2010PCR assays compared with virus isolation.\n27\n Additionally, virological studies only establish the prevalence of active infections. Serology testing would have provided more information about the extent of previous exposure at the farms and markets.
