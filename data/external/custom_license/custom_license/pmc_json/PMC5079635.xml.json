            "text": "Previous clinical trials assessing treatments for unstable type 1 diabetes have demonstrated restoration of pancreatic \u03b2-cell function by allogeneic islet transplantation (1\u20134). In 2000, the University of Alberta reported that transplantation of allogeneic purified islet products resulted in sustained C-peptide levels, improved glycemic control, and prevention of hypoglycemia in seven subjects with type 1 diabetes (5). The results were later confirmed by Brennan et al. (6) in a multicenter trial reporting the 12-year follow-up of seven subjects. One subject experienced graft failure 10.9 years post\u2013islet transplantation. The remaining six continued to have sustained C-peptide levels and improved glycemic control. No episodes of severe hypoglycemia, opportunistic infections, or lymphomas were reported. Although significant progress has been made since the initial trials, development pathways for cellular therapy have required convergence toward regulatory guidelines on clinical trial design. Manufacturing differences at the various processing facilities prevented comparison of clinical results across centers, making it difficult to derive overall conclusions and limiting islet transplantation use in medical practice. Factors affecting the quality of islet products, including organ donor acceptance criteria (7,8), organ recovery techniques, cold ischemia time (9\u201311), organ preservation and transport solutions (12,13), and methods for islet isolation (14), purification, and culture, have been previously reported (15\u201317).",

Manufacturing information was submitted to a DAIT/NIAID-sponsored U.S. Drug Master File. A chemistry, manufacturing, and controls monitoring committee (CMC MC), with representatives from each manufacturing facility and DAIT/NIAID, was responsible for the harmonization of manufacturing processes, including in-process controls, qualification of manufacturing facilities, definition of product specifications, and quality oversight.",
