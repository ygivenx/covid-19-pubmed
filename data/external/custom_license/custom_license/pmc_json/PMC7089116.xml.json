            "text": "PEDV is an enveloped virus possessing an approximately 28 kb, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae [1, 2]. The virus is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhea, vomiting, and which produces high mortality in piglets [3]. The PEDV genome contains at least seven open reading frames (ORFs), encoding four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]), and three non-structural proteins (replicases 1a and 1b and ORF3) [3]. Of these, the S glycoprotein is the major structural protein and is essential for understanding the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field, diversity of PEDV isolates, and the association between genetic mutations and viral antigenicity [4, 5]. The ORF3 gene has been demonstrated to be associated with the virulence of PEDV [6]. The N protein provides a structural basis for the helical nucleocapsid, and is important for the induction of cell-mediated immunity [7]. Two long ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) genes, which occupy two thirds of the genome, encode the non-structural replicase polyproteins (replicase 1a and 1b) [8]. These dates increase our insight into PEDV genomic characteristics.",

In 2014, outbreaks of PED reemerged in Belgium and France and pose more threat on swine industry in Europe [12, 13]. PEDV has been reported in many provinces of China since it was first documented in 1984 [14]. In particular, the devastating outbreak of PEDV since 2010 has caused a high number of deaths among suckling pigs and, as a consequence, substantial economic losses [15]. Although commercial vaccines against PEDV are available, traditional control strategies and the conventional vaccines have failed to control the disease. Currently, PEDV is still evolving within the swine population. To investigate the evolutionary process of PEDV strains, we have been conducting a systematic surveillance program on molecular epidemiology of PEDV circulating in China since 2010.",

The results showed that four putatively major recombinant breakpoints in the CH/HNQX-3/14 genome with a high degree of reliability were detected, which were located, respectively, at the ORF1a (nt 2, 769), S (nt 20, 691 and nt 22, 176), and N (nt 27, 252) genes (Fig. 2a; Table 2). Notably, the zones before breakpoint nt 2, 769 and after the breakpoint nt 2, 7252 exhibited greater similarity with CV777 (an attenuated PEDV vaccine strain used in China), and the zone between breakpoint nt 2, 0691 and nt 2, 2176 had high levels of similarity with DR13 (an attenuated PEDV vaccine strain used in Korea). The other zones spanned ORF1b, partial S, ORF3, E, M, and partial N between the strain CV777 (as the major parent) and the CH/ZMDZY/11 (as the minor parent) (Fig. 2a; Table 2). Additionally, phylogenetic trees based on the complete genome sequences displayed evolutionary relationships and potential recombination events between CH/ZMDZY/11 and the putative parental strains (Fig. 2b). Overall, these findings revealed that CH/HNQX-3/14 may be a mosaic strain derived from 3 putative parental-like strains (CV777, DR13, and CH/ZMDZY/11) through recombination.\n\n",

However, the CV777-based vaccine is not effective against the new PEDV variants circulated in China since 2011 [21]. Genetic recombination plays a critical role in virus evolution and presents one of the greatest challenges to prevent PEDV infection and combating PED because it introduces genetic variation that complicates vaccine development [22]. Divergence of PEDV is driven by genetic recombination, as in other coronaviruses. By recombination analysis, the PEDV strains emerging in the United States have been demonstrated originating from China [23]. A previous study demonstrated that the PEDV circulating strains in China may be originated from either South Korean and/or Chinese ancestors that underwent some genetic variation [24]. Another previous report about a possible recombinant PEDV strain (JS2008) from eastern China provided no evidence on the origin of the recombinant, the recombinant breakpoints and locations in genome [25]. PEDV is still currently circulating in many swine farms in central China, but little is known on the role of recombination in the PEDV evolution. In the present study, we identified a novel recombinant PEDV strain from Henan, a province of central China, and found new combination patterns in PEDV evolution.",

CH/HNQX-3/14 had three unique amino acid mutations (S548A, G749S, and K766L) in the neutralizing epitope regions compared to CV777, DR13, and CH/ZMDZY/11, which located in the epitope region A (aa 499\u2013638), B (aa 748\u2013755), and C (aa 764\u2013771), respectively (Fig. 3). We infer that these mutations might alter the antigenicity of vaccine based on the CV777 and consequently resulted in inefficient vaccination in many swine farms of China. In addition, previous studies confirmed that the neutralizing epitopes of PEDV are mostly present at position aa 499\u2013638, 748\u2013755, 764\u2013771, and 1368\u20131374 of S protein [2]. In the present study, four remarkable deletions were found in the nucleotide sequence of CH/HNQX-3/14 genome. However, only the deletion nt 22,252\u201322,257 (encoded 539AS540) occurred within the epitope region A (aa 499\u2013638), but other three deletions were all out of the epitope regions. In addition, the deletions at position 59QGVN62 were similar to attenuated strains CV777 and DR13 (Fig. 3). Further, the sequence analysis showed that CH/HNQX-3/14 had a continuous 27-bp deletion (nt 25,027\u201325,053) in the ORF3 gene, which is similar to CV777. These results indicated that CH/HNQX-3/14 is a novel field strain with the characterization of attenuated and vaccine strains.\n",

Further, the recombination analysis suggested that CH/HNQX-3/14 may be a recombinant strain derived from the CV777, DR13, and CH/ZMDZY/11. It was noted that the CV777 is a parental strain of PEDV vaccine being used in China. DR13, isolated from South Korean, is an attenuated PEDV strain derived from its virulent strain counterpart by serial propagation in Vero cells, which has been used as vaccine strain in Korean [27]. CH/ZMDZY/11 is a historical virulent PEDV strain isolated from Henan province, where CH/HNQX-3/14 is circulating [28]. Additionally, a retrospective survey found that, since 2011 outbreak, several large-scale transportations of pigs had happened between Henan and neighboring provinces including Anhui. Furthermore, it was surveyed that the CV777 vaccine, as well as DR13 vaccine from Korean, had been used in the swine farms CH/HNQX-3/14 circulating. We speculate that these factors may accelerate the combination between different PEDV strains and be critical to understand the role of recombination in a complex and dynamic PEDV evolution.",
