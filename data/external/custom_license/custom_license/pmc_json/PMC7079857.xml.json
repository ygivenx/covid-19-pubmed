            "text": "Pneumonia is defined as an acute or chronic disease that causes inflammation of the lungs. It is one of the most common infections in the pediatric population and a leading cause of mortality in children in developing countries. It is usually acquired through inhalation of infected upper airway secretions, although hematogenous routes or contiguity can occur [1\u20134]. Viruses, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms are the main etiological agents. Though pneumonia from any organism can occur at any age, certain age groups are at higher risk for particular types of pneumonia. The vast majority of pneumonia in infancy and early childhood is of viral origin and accounts for 50% of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years [2]. The most common bacterial organism in children older than 5 years is S. pneumoniae. Mycoplasma is the most frequent cause of pneumonia in those older than 5 years of age group [2, 4, 5]. The immunological status of the child and the infectious agent also have an important role in the clinical and radiological aspects of the disease [5, 6]. This paper reviews the most common causes of pulmonary infection in children, emphasizing the imaging findings.",

            "text": "Viral infections occur after the inhalation of infected aerosols. Usually the infection begins in the nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract and migrates to the small airways and alveoli. The clinical presentation of viral pneumonia varies greatly depending on the infecting agent, the age and the immune status of the host [4, 5]. Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza are common causes of viral pneumonia in children. In premature-born infants with lung disease, RSV can be devastating. Recently, human metapneumovirus has been recognized as a pathogen. Its ubiquity suggests that it is as important as RSV, and studies suggest its incidence is as high as that of RSV. Nearly 100% of children ages 5\u201310 years are seropositive [7]. Herpes simplex virus is rare, affecting mostly newborns. Patients with immunodeficiency syndromes are also at risk of pneumonia caused by other pathogens such as cytomegalovirus [5]. Influenza virus and RSV infect the pneumocytes, causing diffuse alveolar damage. The alveoli are infiltrated with neutrophils, and mononuclear cells with fibrin and edematous fluid [1, 4]. In addition, the submucosa presents with hyperemia with focal hemorrhage and edema. The small bronchial diameters and poorly developed airways of the smallest children combined with their abundant mucus production cause the characteristic abnormalities revealed by chest radiograph [4, 5]. CT is sometimes indicated in complicated cases of diffuse disease [2].",

Higher mortality rates are associated with coronavirus A (SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome), and influenza virus type A H5N1 (bird flu) and type A H1N1. As with other viral infections, focal or diffuse interstitial opacities are the initial chest radiograph presentation, but they can progress rapidly to bilateral areas of consolidation (Fig. 3). In children with type A H1N1 initial radiographs were often normal, and a trend to more severe disease was seen in children with diffuse ground-glass opacities [2]. Early recognition of the epidemic and an increased index of suspicion in patients with asthma and chronic lung diseases will help in identifying these pneumonias.\n\n",

Reticulonodular infiltrate in one lobe is a usual presentation of mycoplasmal pneumonia. Other radiographic features are lobar consolidation or pseudoconsolidation (Fig. 8), atelectasis, bilateral parahilar peribronchial opacities that resemble butterfly wings, bilobar reticular pattern, pleural and pericardial effusion and hilar lymphadenopathy [12, 13]. Many of these features can be seen in viral pneumonia as well. To distinguish these pneumonias one needs to recognize the clinical features that don\u2019t appear to match the radiograph, such as the degree of respiratory distress or the unusual laboratory findings. For example, Chlamydia trachomatis (or chlamydophila) affects young infants in the first 4 months, and frequently a history of conjunctivitis and a staccato cough are observed. The history will reveal a vaginal delivery and a mother with vulvovaginitis. Chest radiograph shows bilateral reticular interstitial involvement, hyperinflation and bronchial wall thickening.\n\n",

Bronchiectasis is an abnormal irreversible dilation of the proximal and medium-size bronchi caused by weakening or destruction of the muscular and elastic components of the bronchial walls. The more commonly acquired forms occur in older children after destructive pulmonary infections that cause impaired clearance of bronchial secretions, or in cases of superimposed bacterial infections in children with previous conditions such as cystic fibrosis. Bronchiectasis can be observed as thickening of the bronchial walls and marked dilatation of the bronchial channel on both radiographs and chest CT.\n\n",

Sixty percent of new childhood infections occur in children younger than 5 years old [2]. Pulmonary tuberculosis in infancy and childhood is classically related to an inhaled innoculum. There is a small, peripheral primary focus that leads to lymphadenopathy asymmetrically distributed in paratracheal, hilar and/or subcarinal areas. The right side is more commonly affected than the left because of the usual pattern of lymphatic circulation within the lungs [1, 18\u201320]. Enlarged lymph nodes with lobulated, sharp or ill-defined borders can be partially or completely calcified. CT is reserved for complicated cases, not those with a positive skin test. Lymph nodes on CT are dense soft-tissue masses with homogeneous or ring-like enhancement and low-attenuation centers. Inflamed nodes sometimes erode the bronchial wall and discharge caseous material into the bronchus (Fig. 12). This results in bronchogenic spread, characterized as centrilobular or branching centrilobular opacities. Coalescence of the centrilobular opacities results in focal areas of bronchopneumonia [1, 21]. Sporadically, the primary parenchymal lesion continues to enlarge, resulting in focal pneumonitis or lobar pneumonia with thickening of the overlying pleura without distinct hilar lymphadenopathy. It is helpful to divide the disease into subtypes. Primary tuberculosis, which sometimes progresses to a symptomatic infection, is often indistinguishable from other forms of bronchial pneumonia. Enlarged lymph nodes are a hallmark but are not specific. Lymph node involvement is a dominant feature in all subtypes and should raise suspicion for this infection.\n\n",

It is endemic in some geographical regions, such as the Ohio River Valley. Human infection occurs when airborne spores of H. capsulatum are inhaled. The most common imaging features are diffuse reticulonodular opacities with small and diffuse pulmonary nodules (Fig. 14). Usually it affects both lungs as well as hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. This miliary pattern can be identical to miliary tuberculosis and blastomycosis [25]. Pulmonary nodules heal, leaving residual granulomata that undergo central calcification. Mediastinal lymph nodes can also exhibit central caseation, peripheral enhancement and, frequently, calcification as in tuberculosis. Another uncommon but severe complication of histoplasmosis is mediastinal fibrosis, which not only causes mass effect in the mediastinum, it can compress major blood vessels or occlude bronchi (Fig. 15) [26, 27].\n\n\n",

Regardless of the immunodeficiency cause, the most common complications are infections caused by bacterial, viral or opportunistic pathogens [5, 33\u201335]. Immunodeficiency can be divided into major groups of primary and secondary. A simple model of the immune system is that it is mediated by two major mechanisms: humoral and cellular. Defective development of B cells results in humoral immunity abnormalities, while defective development of T cells causes cellular immunity problems. Children with impairment of cellular or humoral immune mechanisms or both experience a higher propensity for specific infections. Humoral immune impairments usually result in bacterial infections, while cell-mediated immune impairments make children more prone to opportunistic, viral and mycobacterial infections [34]. This applies to children with primary immunodeficiency syndromes and secondary immunodeficiency diseases, including AIDS. Most primary immunodeficiencies are humoral deficiencies, with IgA deficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common-variable immunodeficiency the best known examples. These children are prone to repeated bacterial infections with associated pneumonia leading to postinfectious bronchiectasis (Fig. 18). A much smaller group of primary immunodeficiencies is caused by changes in cellular immunity (DiGeorge syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency) or in phagocyte activity like chronic granulomatous disease. DiGeorge syndrome, which is also called thymic aplasia or hypoplasia, is a typical example of a primary T cell deficiency with abnormal development of the thymus, parathyroid glands and heart. Children with this syndrome are susceptible to opportunistic organisms and to graft-versus-host disease from blood transfusions [34].\n\n",

The most common chest radiograph and CT findings are diffuse reticular interstitial opacities that can progress to massive alveolar consolidations resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome in infants (Fig. 20). Postinfection cavitations and bronchiectasis are typical after recurrent infections. Cryptococcus neoformans infection is rare and has unusual presentations in HIV-infected children. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic pulmonary lesions to disseminated infection with necrotizing pneumonia, pleural effusion and meningoencephalitis [43] (Fig. 21).\n\n\n",

Children at this time are very susceptible to all organisms fungal, bacterial and viral. As the child\u2019s neutropenia recovers the immune suppression related to antirejection medication leads to impairment of humoral and cellular immunity (days 30 to 100). These children have a high incidence of cytomegalovirus and RSV. After 100 days the children have near normal immune function and pneumonia is less common. Fungal organisms are associated with very high mortality, with Aspergillus and Candida the most common. It should be noted that children might not demonstrate fever or an elevated white blood cell count. CT is frequently used to monitor these children when there is a high index of suspicion for disease. Fungal infections in particular demonstrate small, ill-defined nodules with or without surrounding ground-glass opacity. Bacterial infections have features similar to those found in the immune-competent child [44].",

The identification of a specific organism is almost never possible from imaging alone. However, by combining imaging and clinical information, the differential diagnoses can be generated. Chest radiographs remain the mainstay of pneumonia imaging, supplemented with sonography and CT for specific indications. Investigation of specific organisms using image-guided sampling and serological determinations is important in designing therapy. During treatment the radiologist can recognize complications such as cavitation, abscess and empyema. The role of image-guided intervention is beyond the scope of this paper, but in many centers the radiologist might be asked to address each of these complications.",
