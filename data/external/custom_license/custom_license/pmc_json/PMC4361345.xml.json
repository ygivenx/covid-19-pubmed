            "text": "Enteric pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, exert a major impact on public health worldwide including tropical regions. In humans and animals, the enteric pathogens, which include viruses, bacteria and protozoa, infect the intestine epithelial lining, resulting in food poisoning or diarrheal disease. When enteric pathogens enter humans or animals via the oral route, they must withstand the proteolytic conditions in the stomach before penetrating the mucus layer and accessing the underlying gut epithelium for attachment or cell invasion. Adhesion of the enteric pathogens to the intestine epithelial tissue is a prerequisite for the initiation of infection. In many systems it is mediated by lectins present on the surface of the pathogen that bind to complementary carbohydrates on the surface of the host cells. Carbohydrates such as heparan sulfate have been reported to play a crucial role in the entry or budding of viruses [1], and bacterial lectins typically act in the form of elongated submicroscopic multisubunit protein appendages, known as pili [2]. Recently, the surface proteins of apicomplexan parasites have also been reported to bind to carbohydrates on host cells [3]. Thus the initial steps of host cell recognition by enteric pathogens may incorporate common strategies.",

Insights obtained from studies designed to address this concept will be invaluable to develop novel therapies using innovative drug design and engineered vaccine candidates to limit the infectivity of widespread enteric pathogens. Here, we review the recent major advances in research on the role of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of enteric pathogenic viruses, bacteria and protozoa. We further discuss how our knowledge regarding these carbohydrates may influence prophylactic and therapeutic drug development for the treatment of diseases caused by enteric pathogens.",

            "text": "Here, we focus on the association of carbohydrates with norovirus as the virus enters the host cell. Norovirus, a member of the family Caliciviridae, is a major cause of acute water- and food-borne gastroenteritis [4]. Norovirus infection is associated with up to 90% of epidemic non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis cases worldwide [5]. Noroviruses are divided into at least five genotypes, three of which (genogroups I, II, and IV) infect humans. Except for a few genotypes, all noroviruses bind to HBGAs including ABH antigens and Lewis antigens [5, 6]. In HBGAs, carbohydrate core structures constitute antigenically distinct phenotypes, namely type 1 (Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc\u03b2) and type 2 (Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b2). H antigen (Fuc-\u03b11-2Gal), i.e., O-type antigen, is generated by fucose transfer to a galactose residue with an \u03b11-2 linkage of type 1 or type 2. The A antigen (GalNAc \u03b11-3(Fuc-\u03b11-2)Gal) and B antigen (Gal \u03b11-3(Fuc-\u03b11-2)Gal) of HBGAs are generated by transfer of GalNAc and Gal, respectively, to an H structure irrespective of the carbohydrate core structure. FUT1 and FUT2 are \u03b11,2FUTs that catalyze the transfer of Fuc to the Gal residue of type 1 and 2 chains, thereby resulting in the synthesis of H type 1 and H type 2, respectively. HBGAs are found in saliva and mucosal secretions from the intestinal epithelial cells of secretors (i.e., individuals who have the FUT2 gene that encodes a fucosyltransferase).",

Moreover, the association data between blood type and NV/68 infection showed that, among secretor volunteers, blood groups O and A were associated with an increased risk of infection, while blood group B was associated with a decreased risk. On the other hand, epidemiological studies have shown that some norovirus strains with ABH phenotypes that differ from that of NV/68 can infect individuals. GII/4, which is known as a global epidemic strain, binds more HBGAs than other strains, suggesting that the strength of transmission of GII/4 strains is related to the broad recognition of HBGAs [6]. The recognition sites on HBGAs by norovirus have been classified according to the interaction of the virus with the H, A, B, and Le epitopes (Fig. 1) [6, 7]. HBGAs are important factors for determining host specificity, although it is still unclear whether HBGAs act as the primary receptor or enhance norovirus infectivity. Researchers including ourselves have demonstrated that feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the genus Vesivirus, infects the upper respiratory tract by attaching to \u03b12-6-linked sialic acids and using junctional adhesion molecule-1 for internalization [8, 9]. It is comparatively easy to study the life cycle of FCV because the virus replicates efficiently in cell culture without specific supplementation, whereas noroviruses are not cultivable in cell culture.",

A previous report showed that when one of the fimbriae carried by Salmonella typhimurium was deleted, only virulence for mouse was moderately altered, and that multiple fimbrial adhesins were required for full virulence [16]. For Salmonella and assortative bacteria, type 1 fimbria is the best characterized [17]. Type 1 fimbriae consist of a major component (FimA) and a minor component (FimH) (Fig. 2). FimH lies at the tip of type 1 fimbriae, where it mediates binding to D-mannose-containing structures and enables the bacteria to colonize various host tissues [18]. Type 1 fimbriae are also produced by other gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae [19]. The FimH protein of enterobacterial species including Salmonella recognizes mannose-containing oligosaccharides [18]. In the case of E. coli, previous reports have shown that FimH protein has a considerably high affinity for oligosaccharides containing Man\u03b11-3, such as Man\u03b11-3Man\u03b21-4GlcNAc and Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-4)Man, which are constituents of cell surface glycoproteins [19]. The process of bacterial adhesion to the epithelial cell surface mediated by Type 1 fimbriae (FimH) is conservative among enterobacteria. Type 1 fimbriae are highly expressed on the bacterial surface, allowing large quantities of bacteria to adhere via the FimH-Mannose interaction (Fig. 3).",

Some type 4 fimbriae are only present at low levels on the surface of bacteria, and are localized at the bacterial pole. Although their expression level is low, type 4 fimbriae frequently play an important role in bacterial infection. Like type 1 fimbriae, type 4 fimbriae are thought to recognize carbohydrates as specific receptors, but the receptor molecules and precise functions of some type 4 fimbriae have yet to be determined. For example, the function of the type 4 fimbria bundle-forming pili (BFP), an important virulence factor for pathogenic E. coli strains, is not yet known (Fig. 2). BFP may not be involved in initial adhesion; rather, it may participate in the formation of the bacterial colony by forming bundles that link one bacterium to another [20]. Although the function of and receptors for type 4 fimbriae remain unclear, bacterial virulence has been shown to decrease when type 4 fimbriae are deleted [16]. LPF mediates the adhesion of S. typhimurium to murine Peyer\u2019s patches [21]. LPF was first described in S. typhimurium, and is found in numerous pathogenic E. coli strains [22]. Although its specific receptor remains unclear, extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs), which comprise an interlocking mesh of fibrous proteins and glycosaminoglycans, may act as a receptor for LPF of enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 (Fig. 3). ECMs are modified by various carbohydrate moieties, and the addition of mannose inhibits LPF-ECM interaction. Then mannose-containing carbohydrates may participate in bacterial adhesion by LPF [23].",

It specifically binds to trisaccharide Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc, also known as the Lewis X (LeX) blood group antigen (Fig. 3) [13]. The LeX antigen is defined by the presence of a terminal Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b1-3)GlcNAc moiety on saccharide chains of glycoproteins or glycosphingolipids; in the human intestine, it is expressed mainly in crypt epithelial cells [25]. S. typhimurium possesses PEF as an adhesin that binds to a crypt-specific histo-blood group antigen that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human infections. Abundant crypt abscesses are commonly found in S. typhimurium patients, raising the possibility that the pathogen may bind to human crypt epithelium at a later stage of infection. In a situation where Peyer\u2019s patches are unavailable because of an inflammatory reaction, Salmonella can colonize at the crypt epithelium remaining intact and persist on the surface of the host intestinal tract [13, 25].",

In the case of Salmonella and assortative bacteria, the FimH adhesins show amino acid sequence diversity. This diversity in FimH structure results in the variation in affinity profiles. E. coli FimH shows a high affinity for aromatic \u03b1-mannosides as well as Man\u03b11-3 structures. On the other hand, the FimH of Salmonella species shows a high affinity for \u03b1-mannosides and a low affinity for aromatic \u03b1-mannosides [19]. In the case of Salmonella, allelic variation of FimH adhesion directs not only host cell-specific recognition but also distinctive binding to mammalian and avian receptors. This allele-specific binding profile parallels the host specificity of the respective FimH-expressing pathogen [28]. Similarly, the Lewis b (Leb) blood group phenotype in combination with secretor status may hinder colonization of Helicobacter pylori in certain populations [29]. H. pylori express blood group antigen b-binding adhesion (BabA), and BabA binds to Leb antigens. Salmonella and assortative bacteria contain various adhesion factors, including several kinds of fimbriae, which contribute to bacterial virulence; however, analyses of their specific receptor moieties and functions are not yet complete [13, 15].",

The ability of T. gondii to infect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells deficient in sialic acids was reduced by 26.9% compared to wild-type cells, indicating that sialic acid is critical for attachment and invasion of T. gondii (Fig. 4) [35]. T. gondii microneme protein 1 (TgMIC1) forms a macromolecular complex with TgMIC4 and TgMIC6. Single deletion of the TgMIC1 gene significantly decreases the invasion of host cells, suggesting an essential role for TgMIC1 in host cell attachment and invasion of T. gondii [36]. Structural analysis of TgMIC1 revealed a novel cell-binding motif called microneme adhesive repeat region (MARR), which provides a specialized structure for glycan discrimination [37]. Carbohydrate microarray analyses showed that TgMIC13, TgMIC1 and its homologue Neospora caninum MIC1 share a preference for \u03b12-3- over \u03b12-6-linked sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine sequences [38]. P104, a PAN/apple domain-containing protein expressed at the apical end of the extracellular parasite, functions as a ligand in the attachment of T. gondii to chondroitin sulfate and other receptors on the host cell, facilitating invasion by the parasite (Fig. 4) [39].",

The terminal structures of mucin oligosaccharides are highly heterogeneous and vary between and within species as well as between and even within tissues. The array of oligosaccharide structures on individual mucin molecules is also somewhat determined by stochastic events as the mucin protein moves through the Golgi apparatus [66]. The secreted mucins themselves likely function as decoys for adhesins that have been evolved by pathogens to engage the cell surface, as the mucins express many of the oligosaccharide structures found on the cell surface and are constitutively produced in large amounts, constantly washing the mucosal surfaces [58].

Bacterial lectin-like adhesive molecules (adhesins) included in bacterial fimbriae recognize and bind to sugar-containing molecules on the host cell surface. Bacterial fimbriae and adhesins contribute to bacterial attachment, the initial step of bacterial infection. Each bacterial adhesin recognizes a specific structure of its target sugar molecule, and bacterial fimbriae also help to determine the specificity (species, tissue, or cell) of bacterial infection. Two types of representative fimbriae of Salmonella and assortative bacteria (Type 1 fimbriae and Type 4 fimbriae) are shown. Type 1 fimbriae are short and highly expressed entirely on the surface of bacteria. Type 4 fimbriae are thin and flexible, expressed at low levels, and are generally located at the polar part of bacteria. FimA and FimH are categorized as Type 1 fimbriae. Long-polar fimbriae (LPF), Plasmid-code fimbriae (PEF) and bundle-forming pili (BFP) are categorized as Type 4 fimbriae. Std fimbriae are categorized as \u03c0-fimbriae. Bacterial flagella are the moving apparatus of bacteria, but their components can also contribute to the binding to sugar-containing molecules.",

            "text": "Fig.\u00a03.: Various fimbriae of Salmonella and assortative bacteria and their sugar-containing receptor molecules. Salmonella and assortative bacteria express a variety of fimbriae. The minor component of Type 1 fimbriae, FimH, is present at the tip of type 1 fimbriae, mediates binding to D-mannose-containing structures and enables bacteria to colonize various host tissues [18]. Type 1 fimbria is highly expressed on the bacterial surface, allowing large amounts of bacteria to adhere via the FimH-mannose interaction. The various kinds of type 4 fimbriae play an important role in bacterial infection. Plasmid-encoded fimbria (PEF) is required for bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells. PEF specifically binds to trisaccharide Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc, also known as the Lewis X (LeX) blood group antigen [13]. Long polar fimbria (LPF) mediates the adhesion of S. typhimurium to murine Peyer\u2019s patches [21]. Extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs) may act as receptors for LPF. ECMs are modified with various carbohydrate moieties, and the presence of Mannose inhibits the LPF-ECM interaction. Mannose-containing carbohydrates may participate in bacterial adhesion via LPF [23]. Std fimbriae are categorized as \u03c0-fimbriae and are well conserved among S. enterica serotypes but absent from other related bacterial species. Std fimbriae recognize and bind the H type 2 histo-blood group oligosaccharide, the terminal Fuc\u03b11-2Gal\u03b21 moiety. S. typhi and S. paratifi can survive within the macrophages after they are engulfed by phagocytosis. Non-typhoidal Salmonella, S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, however, are unable to survive within macrophages.",
