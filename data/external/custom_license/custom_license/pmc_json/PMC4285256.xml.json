Double-stranded cDNA was purified by using the MSB Spin PCRapace Purification Kit (Invitek, Berlin, Germany) and an elution volume of 30 \u03bcL. Random amplification was performed by using the procedures reported by Stang and Korn (7). Successful random amplification (a 200\u20132,000-bp smear) was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis of 10 \u03bcL of PCR product. The duration of this procedure was \u22484.5 h.

Just 3 genome sequences are available for bats, although they are the second most abundant mammalian species (exceeded only by rodents). There are >1,100 species of bats worldwide and they are suspected vectors of pathogenic viruses (e.g., Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, lyssavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus).

Furthermore, this protocol can be used in metagenomic virome studies and will be beneficial whenever library construction is necessary (i.e., molecular cloning and NGS) to increase detection likelihood for viruses from any biological source. This protocol would be particularly useful for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in virus analysis of biological samples in which levels of background nucleic acids are high, which result in difficulties in virus detection and identification. Thus, the TUViD-VM protocol described greatly increases the likelihood of detecting viruses during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases and in metagenomic virus detection studies.",
