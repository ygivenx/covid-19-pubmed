PHO\u2019s respiratory outbreak testing algorithm included a multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) kit (Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral panel; Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, ON, Canada) used according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations to test nasopharyngeal swabs for viral pathogens [adenovirus, influenza A/B, parainfluenza 1\u20104, RSV A/B, enterovirus/human rhinovirus (ENT/HRV), coronavirus OC43/229E/NL63/HKU1, and metapneumovirus]. An alternate multiplex NAAT kit (Seeplex RV; Seegene USA, Rockville, MD, USA) was used in conjunction with the Luminex assay during periods of higher demand.

Despite an increased number of respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs caused by A(H1N1)pdm09 during the second wave of the 2009 pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09 continued to constitute a small proportion of detected viruses in this setting. ENT/HRV was detected in the majority of respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs, where the vast majority of residents were elderly. Recently published reports\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n have already highlighted these findings. However, this study provides a larger sample size and is unique in that both institutional (predominantly elderly) and community outbreak (predominantly children) settings are described. We also found an increased likelihood of detecting viruses causing outbreaks as the number of specimens tested increased. Viruses causing coinfections may be co\u2010transmitted between patients as part of the same outbreak, rather than circulating independently of each other.",

A distinction between upper and lower respiratory tract infections, the role of asymptomatic shedding, and comparison of severity of outbreaks could not be performed as clinical data were missing. In Ontario, the local medical officer of health or designate determines whether an institutional outbreak meets the provincial case definition. PHO laboratories do not receive sufficient outbreak information to make this determination. In this context, this study highlights the importance of submitting more than one sample to properly investigate an outbreak. Other bacterial agents like Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumonia could not be ruled out as the cause of outbreaks as samples were not routinely tested for them. A distinction could not be made between staff and resident cases in this study as staff information was not systematically reported. This highlights a current deficiency in the investigation and reporting of staff illness in LTCFs.\n9\n An increased rate of ENT/HRV outbreaks may have been observed during the pandemic because of increased vigilance by individuals to report symptoms to their healthcare providers, who in turn had a lower threshold to report outbreaks to the public health units who coordinate laboratory investigations. Therefore, we might have seen increased specimen collection and testing that may have influenced our findings.",
