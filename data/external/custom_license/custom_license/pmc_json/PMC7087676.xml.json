            "text": "White spot syndrome, caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), has become the most hazardous and devastating disease in shrimp culture. The virus can lead to 100% shrimp mortality within 7\u223c10 days in commercial shrimp farms, resulting in large economic losses (Escobedo-Bonilla et al. 2008). WSSV, a rod-shaped enveloped DNA virus, contains a double-stranded DNA genome with 184 potential open reading frames (Yang et al. 2001). Recently, the virus is classified as a new genus Whispovirus of a new family Nimaviridae (Mayo 2002). Due to the importance of viral envelop proteins in virus infection, many WSSV structural proteins have been characterized (Tsai et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005). Among the WSSV structural proteins, the VP28 protein, located in the viral envelope (Zhang et al. 2002), plays very important roles in the invasion of WSSV into shrimp (Witteveldt et al. 2004a, b; Wu et al. 2005; Xu et al. 2007). It has been reported that the VP28 protein, when being injected intramuscularly or administered orally, provides higher and prolonged survival rates after WSSV challenge (Witteveldt et al. 2004a, b). Interestingly, the silencing of vp28 gene by a specific 21-bp short interfering RNA (vp28-siRNA) in vivo leads to the eradication of WSSV in the virus-infected shrimp (Xu et al. 2007), which sheds a light on the control of WSSV infection in shrimp industry by administration of RNAi.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates posttranscriptional silencing of homologous genes (Fire et al. 1998; Elbashir et al. 2001; Hammond et al. 2001; Hannon 2002). Higher eukaryotes can mount antiviral immune responses induced by dsRNA. RNAi is sequence-specific and can therefore be used to target gene expression (Cullen 2002). In invertebrates, RNAi studies are commonly performed with large dsRNA molecules, which are cleaved into smaller 21\u201325-bp siRNAs by the host enzymes (Hammond et al. 2000). However, it is reported that the 21-bp siRNAs are the most effective at triggering RNAi in vitro (Kim et al. 2004). In fact, RNAi can be used as an antiviral immune defense strategy in Caenorhabditis elegans during VSV infection (Wilkins et al. 2005). RNAi has been widely applied to suppress the infection or replication of many viruses, including several important human pathogens such as poliovirus (Gitlin et al. 2002), HIV-1 (Jacque et al. 2002), hepatitis B virus (McCaffrey et al. 2003), hepatitis C virus (Kapadia et al. 2003), foot and mouth disease virus (Kahana et al. 2004), influenza virus (Tompkins et al. 2004), and SARS coronavirus (Li et al. 2005). In shrimp, it is reported that the injection of sequence-dependent siRNA, targeting the vp28 gene of WSSV, can eliminate the WSSV in virus-infected cells (Xu et al. 2007). RNAi technology has been recently extended to shrimp as a therapeutic approach and efficient strategy for viral disease prevention in the aquaculture industry (Shekhar and Lu 2009; Westenberg et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2007). However, the efficient approach for delivery of siRNA into shrimp remains to be addressed.",

The advantages of siRNA delivery system with YCWP include the high RNA capacity, multiplexable RNA, oral bioavailability, \u03b2-1,3-d-glucan receptor targeting to macrophages, cell trafficking to the reticuloendothelial system, and sites of pathology. Based on our previous study (Xu et al. 2007), in this investigation, the antiviral vp28-siRNA was encapsulated with \u03b2-1,3-d-glucan and delivered into shrimp. The results showed that the \u03b2-1,3-d-glucan-encapsulated vp28-siRNA particles (GeRPs) effectively inhibited the replication of WSSV in shrimp. Further evidence indicated that the mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp was significantly decreased by GeRPs.

Therefore, this siRNA was used as a target siRNA to control WSSV in this study. As controls, the sequence of vp28-siRNA was rearranged at random and mutated at one nucleotide, respectively, resulting in the corresponding random-siRNA (5\u2032-CAGACCTCACGACACAACA-3\u2032) and mutation-siRNA (5\u2032-GACCAGCGAAACCCACACA-3\u2032). The siRNAs used in this study consisted of 21-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs, each strand of which contained a 19-nucleotide target sequence and a two-uracil (U) overhang at the 3\u2032 end. The siRNAs were synthesized in vitro using in vitro Transcription T7 Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The synthesized siRNAs were dissolved in siRNA buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) and quantified by spectrophotometry.",

It has been reported that the oral administration of \u03b2-1,3-glucan extracted from Schizophyllum commune can improve the shrimp immunity against WSSV (Chang et al. 2003). However, \u03b2-1,3-glucan, derived from bakers\u2019 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exhibits no protection of shrimp against WSSV infection (Sukumaran et al. 2010).

Therefore, it could be concluded that the protection of shrimp against WSSV was due to the presence of vp28-siRNA. Our previous study showed that the sustainable presence of vp28-siRNA could lead to the elimination of WSSV in shrimp (Xu et al. 2007).
