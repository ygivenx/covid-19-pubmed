            "text": "Neonatal calf diarrhea is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Younis and El-Naker 2009). Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus, coronavirus, and cryptosporidium are the four major pathogens associated with neonatal calf diarrhea (Miraglia et al. 2001). ETEC is an important and global cause of severe, watery diarrhea in the offspring of some animal species such as newborn calves and pigs (Nagy and Fekete 2005.). Almost all ETEC bacteria are known to adhere to receptors on the small intestinal epithelium by their fimbriae without inducing significant morphological changes. Furthermore, they secrete enterotoxins that cause reduced absorption and increase the fluid and electrolyte secretion of the small intestine (Nagy and Fekete 2005). The most commonly observed fimbriae on ETEC from calves with diarrhea are F5, also named K99 and F41 (Nagy and Fekete 1999). Two biological classes of enterotoxins, heat labile (LT) and heat stable (STa and STb), are produced by ETEC. Most bovine ETEC produce STa (Guth 2000).",

While it may be convenient to focus on the principal infectious causes of calf diarrhea, it must be remembered that it is generally the result of interaction between a number of related risk factors, including management and environmental factors (Crouch et al. 2001; Lundborg et al. 2005). Local studies in Iran focused on the identification of fimbriae and enterotoxins by the use of serological tests and biological assays. These methods can be time consuming, expensive, and the expression of virulence factors depends on synthetic media and, in some cases, requires the euthanasia of the animals. Moreover, the use of conventional tests for the determination of K99 and F41 fimbriae may give false\u2013negative results. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no studies on the identification of virulence genes using DNA-based and serological techniques for the detection of E. coli K99 and F41 have been published in Iran to date. Virulence genes in diarrheic neonatal calves and associated risk factors have not been described in Iran nor in the Middle East and Western South Asia. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to investigate the phenotypic and genotypic screening of virulence genes in E. coli K99 and F41, as well as to study the risk factors associated with these infections.",

Three sets of primers were applied for the amplification of genes described in (Table 1). PCR was carried out in a 25-\u03bcl reaction volume containing 10 \u00d7 PCR buffer (2.5 \u03bcl), 25 mM MgCl2 (1.25 \u03bcl), dNTP (10 mM, 0.5 \u03bcl), primer (1 \u03bcl, 20 pmol), DNA template (1 \u03bcl, 100 ng), distilled water (18.5 \u03bcl), and Taq DNA polymerase (0.25 \u03bcl). The PCR protocol was as follows: 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 56\u00b0C for 35 s, and 70\u00b0C for 1 min for 25 cycles, followed by 72\u00b0C for the final extension for 10 min. A negative control was included without the addition of a DNA template. The reference (RCCT 86) strains were used as positive controls. The amplified products were visualized by standard gel electrophoresis of 7 \u03bcl of the final reaction mixture in 1.5% agarose. DNA ladder 100 bp was used as the molecular size marker (100\u20131,000 bp). The gels were stained with ethidium bromide for 5 min, washed in distilled water, analyzed under UV light, and photographed with a Kodak camera system (Gel Logic 200).\n\n",

A similar result was reported by (Younis and El-Naker 2009); however, a higher prevalence was reported by Acha et al. (2004) who reported a prevalence rate of 40% (Acha et al. 2004), on the contrary, a lower prevalence (0.57%, 2.3%, and 7.3%) was recorded by (Zhang et al. 2007) and (Salvadori et al. 2003), respectively. Twenty-five percent of K99 positive strains that carried both F5 and F41 fimbriae genes did not possess the STa toxin gene. The late isolates are still shown to attach to calves enterocytes in experimental infection studies. They are useful as future live vaccine candidates. Acha et al. indicated that enterotoxin STa was not detected in any E. coli K99 isolates from the diarrheal calves (Acha et al. 2004). The majority of K99 isolates belong to the O serogroups of O8, O9, O20, and O101 (Nagy and Fekete 1999) and, in this work, we found that K99 positive isolates belong to serogroups O101 and O9. This implied that regional difference or other selective advantages would allow these E. coli serogroups to proliferate in the intestine of diarrheal calves from the surveyed regions in Iran. Hence, distinct reasons causing this difference are still to be discovered. In the present study, infection with E. coli K99 was found to be significantly affected by the animal\u2019s age, season and geographic region, colostrum intake, management measure, and vaccination of dam. A high association was observed between age and E. coli K99 infection (Table 3). The first week of life is the main age of infection. This finding was supported by (Akam et al. 2004), who found that the susceptibility was higher to E. coli K99 during the first week of life (66.6%). Geographical regions were found to have an impact on the prevalence of calf diarrhea with a high outbreak of E. coli K99 infection. Also 12 isolates were recorded from the south of Fars province (Darab city) with a warm climate while only four isolates were from the north of this state with cold weather (Zarghan and Beyza city). These results contradict with Younis and El-Naker (2009) who reported a narrow variation in the climatic condition in the examined area. The effect of the geographical region on the prevalence of colibacillosis may be due to the calving period (autumn and summer), as well as the variation of temperature in the north and south of the province.",

The data has shown that passive immunity and resistance of newborn calves against ETEC infection was strongly associated to colostrum feeding. Hand-fed calves were more frequently infected with ETEC K99 compared to those receiving colostrum intakes from their dams. This result coincided with that previously recorded by Barrington et al. (2002), who reported that passively acquired immunity through colostrum is the major risk factor related to preventing calf infection and the prevalence of diarrhea. Some management factors such as providing a clean maternity area, cleaning and disinfecting calf feeding equipment between uses and replacing these types of equipment with new ones are crucial factors in achieving the best possible calves life start. This ensures that calving environment is as clean as pathogen-free as possible.",
