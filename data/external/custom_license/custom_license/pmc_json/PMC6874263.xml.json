Neither study presented conclusive evidence for MERS-CoV circulation in Sudan. Here, we provide the results of a study conducted in the Butana region of Al Gezira, Sudan, to investigate the local point prevalence of MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV antibodies among camel handlers, camels, and other animals in 2015 and 2017. We also report the results of a MERS-CoV screening in camels from Sudan sampled in Qatar directly upon importation.",

At the TCRC, \u2248100 camels are generally present and kept out of contact with other camels. Before their arrival at the TCRC, they were herded on the Butana Plain. We also collected samples from 90 Sudan camels that were imported into Qatar in 2015. After arriving at the Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, these camels were directly transported to the Al Shahaniya animal market in Doha. We sampled them immediately after their arrival. We stored all samples locally (1\u20131.5 years in Sudan, 1 month in Qatar) and tested them after shipment to the Netherlands.",

We performed a virus neutralization test and a spike S1 protein\u2013based ELISA (human serum samples only) to confirm the detection of MERS-CoV antibodies by protein microarray (5). In confirmatory tests, we included equal numbers of negative serum samples of the same species, when available. We considered samples positive if results of all tests were positive (protein microarray cutoff 1:20, 50% plaque-reduction neutralization titer cutoff 1:20, ELISA cutoff optical density 0.5). To resolve problems with possible mislabeling, we tested all animal serum samples collected in 2017 with a cytochrome B gene PCR to confirm species origins (6). We tested camel nasal (n = 168), nasopharyngeal (n = 24), and rectal (n = 61) swab specimens and milk (n = 33), urine (n = 30), and fecal (n = 42) samples for MERS-CoV RNA using a reverse transcription PCR targeting the upstream of envelope and nucleocapsid genes, as described previously (7,8). In addition, we tested legs of camel ticks (Hyalomma dromedarii) and bat (Tadarida spp.) tissues collected at the TCRC in 2015 for MERS-CoV RNA.",

            "text": "The number of human and livestock samples tested was low in this investigation. Therefore, the results of this study are not conclusive. However, this study provides preliminary insight into MERS-CoV circulation in Sudan, the country with the third largest dromedary camel population in the world (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QA). We show evidence of extensive MERS-CoV circulation in camels but no evidence of circulation in other livestock, bats, and humans.",
