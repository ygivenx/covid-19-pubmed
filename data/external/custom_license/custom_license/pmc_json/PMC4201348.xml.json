            "text": "We designed and constructed a\n16F6 humanization library based on\na chimeric template where CDR segments from 16F6 were grafted onto\nthe YADS1 scaffold (Figure 1a). Restricted\ndiversification was permitted at positions near the CDR segments that\ndid not involve direct antigen contacts at the analogous sites in\n16F6 but had differing residue identity between 16F6 and YADS1. For\nexample, CDR-H1 position 29 (Ile in YADS1 but Phe in 16F6) was allowed\nto vary among the four residues Phe/Ile/Leu/Met, thus encoding both\nthe 16F6 and YADS1 residues as well as two others (Leu and Met) with\nsimilar properties. This randomization strategy was applied to several\npositions in CDR-H1, H2, and H3, as well as CDR-L1 and L3. In addition,\ntwo residues in CDR-L2 (53 and 56) differed among YADS1 (Tyr and Ser,\nrespectively) and 16F6 (both Thr), but the corresponding residues\nmade partial contacts to the antigen in 16F6. Therefore, these two\npositions were diversified with an NNK (N = A/T/C/G; K = G/T) codon allowing all 20 possible\namino acids. Full details for the randomization strategy are discussed\nin the Figure 1 caption. In total, 13 positions\nwere randomized with a theoretical diversity 4.5 \u00d7 108 at the DNA level and 4 \u00d7 107 at the protein level;\nthe library was produced with \u223c1010 unique members,\nallowing exhaustive sampling. The library was expressed as a bivalent\nFab fusion to the pIII gene as has been previously described for other\nsynthetic antibodies.20,21 This bivalent display format\nwas chosen to more accurately mimic the nature of an IgG, which would\nbe the preferred downstream therapeutic format.",

            "text": "Six rounds of\nselection were performed against a soluble, recombinant\nSUDV GP (Boniface variant) that encompasses residues 33\u2013649\n(GPSUDV). This protein includes all major domains on GP1\nand GP2 except the transmembrane domain and C-terminal tail and is\nmostly trimeric in solution (data not shown). Previous work has demonstrated\nthat GP constructs expressed in mammalian cells but lacking the transmembrane\nsegment provide a suitable mimic of the prefusion spike for antibody\nselection, binding, and other structural studies.7,8,18,19 Several hundred\nclones were screened for binding to GPSUDV from output\npopulations of rounds 3\u20136 by monoclonal phage ELISA to identify\n38 clones representing 17 unique sequences (see Supporting Information). The distribution of amino acids among\nthese clones is represented in Figure 1c. To\ncompare requirements for recognition and stability, a parallel selection\nto determine display preferences was performed against anti-FLAG antibody\nM2; a FLAG epitope was included at the C-terminus of the phage displayed\nlight chain, and therefore any preferences for display will be evident\nwith this analysis.23,24 Comparison of amino acid composition\namong ELISA-positive clones from the functional selection (GPSUDV) and the display selection (M2) distribution revealed\nmoderate preferences for GPSUDV recognition at many positions\nbut strong preferences for the 16F6 residues at positions 29, 100a,\nand 100b of the heavy chain. Inspection of the 16F6 crystal structure\nsuggests that F29 and F100b likely support loop conformations, as\nthese residues are buried and participate in internal hydrophobic\ninteractions (see Supporting Information).19 Residue F100a participates in the\nstructural paratope, and therefore this residue is likely critical\nfor the intermolecular interface. In contrast, the 16F6 residue Ser\nat position 52a of CDR-H2 is less preferred compared with the YADS1\ncognate residue Pro. This preference is more evident in clones showing\nstronger neutralization efficacy (below). Since Pro has a strong effect\non loop conformations, the Pro at this position may serve to orient\nthe CDR-H2 loop toward favorable GP recognition in the human framework.",

Dose-dependent inhibition\nprofiles against VSV-GPSUDV revealed IC50 values\nbelow 10 nM (Figure 2c). Both mAbs were tested\nagainst authentic SUDV under Biosafety level 4 (BSL4) conditions and\nfound to neutralize with IC50s below 4 nM (E10) and 8 nM\n(F4) (Figure 2d). When the SUDV neutralization\nassays were performed in the presence of 5% guinea pig complement,\nIC50s below 4 nM were observed in both cases. These results\nindicate that E10 and F4 have potent neutralization activity against\nSUDV GP-mediated cell entry. The fact that IC50s against\nSUDV were similar in the presence or absence of complement suggests\nthat the mechanism involves binding of GP and inhibition of cell entry,\nbut not opsonization or activation of the complement pathway. We performed\ncompetitive ELISA experiments to determine if 16F6, E10, and F4 shared\na common epitope. 16F6 was biotinylated (b16F6), and then the capacity\nof unbiotinylated 16F6 (positive control), E10, and F4 to inhibit\nb16F6 binding in a dose-specific manner was evaluated. As shown in\nFigure 3, all three unbiotinylated antibodies\ncompeted effectively with b16F6 with IC50 values below\n0.2 \u03bcM for 16F6 and F4 and \u223c0.6 \u03bcM for E10. These\nresults indicate that all three antibodies share an epitope and have\nrelatively comparable binding affinities to GPSUDV, with\nmodestly reduced affinity in the case of E10. Since library diversification\nfocused mostly on supporting CDR loop residues, rather than direct\ncontact sites, it is not surprising that affinities of the humanized\nclones were comparable or slightly decreased relative to the murine\n16F6 parent.",
