            "text": "Pseudorabies virus (PrV) is an enveloped virus and a member of alphaherpesviruses. It causes Aujeszky\u2019s disease (AD) in its natural host (pig). In susceptible species, PrV infection is often fatal, and animals die from central nervous system disorders [10]. The PrV genome consists of linear, double-stranded, non-circularly permuted DNA molecules, and is closely similar to that of the prototypical herpes simplex virus (HSV). The PrV envelope contains at least 10 different viral glycoproteins. In PrV-infected cells, newly synthesized viral envelope glycoproteins travel from the endoplasmic reticulum via the Golgi network to the plasma membrane, rendering the cells recognizable for virus-specific antibodies [5].",

            "text": "Methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) is able to deplete the plasma membrane cholesterol and has been used to show the importance of cholesterol/lipid rafts for the entry of different viruses [3, 8, 16, 17, 19, 22]. Monospecific antibody-induced patching of some PrV glycoproteins indicated that the antibody-induced patches were enriched in monosialoganglioside GM1 (GM1), a marker of lipid raft microdomains, but were excluded for transferrin receptor, a non-raft marker, suggesting that these viral proteins associate with lipid rafts to a different extent. However, addition of M\u03b2CD only slightly reduced copatching efficiency between the different viral proteins, indicating that other factors, perhaps tegument\u2013glycoprotein interactions, may be important for the observed copatching events [5]. Recently, it has been reported that cholesterol in the plasma membrane is required for efficient PrV entry [4]. Here, we confirm the importance of cholesterol in plasma membrane and extend these findings by (i) quantifying the decrease of the cholesterol content and (ii) by showing that three different strains are affected in the same way. Furthermore, we show for the first time that cholesterol depletion from the viral membrane is also detrimental for PrV infection.",

At a concentration of 1.2 mM, the viral infectivity was reduced by about 95%. The infectivity of control VSV was not affected by M\u03b2CD treatment significantly. In order to find out whether the effect of cholesterol depletion was reversible, virus was treated with 1.2 mM M\u03b2CD followed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. As shown in Fig. 2d, replenishment of cholesterol resulted in an increase of the infectivity of M\u03b2CD-treated PrV. At a concentration of 500 \u03bcM exogenous cholesterol, viral infectivity recovered up to 60% value of that determined prior to cholesterol depletion.",

            "text": "For enveloped viruses, the fusion between the viral envelope and cellular membrane is a key step in the initiation of an infection. Cholesterol appears to play an important role in this process. The dependence of some viruses on cholesterol is restricted to either of the two membranes. Infectivities of influenza virus and canine distemper virus (CDV) are inhibited when cholesterol is depleted from the viral membrane [8, 24]. Infection by ecotropic murine leukemia virus is affected by depletion of cholesterol from the target cell [14]. In the case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the infection is sensitive to variations in both the viral and PM cholesterol [13, 15]. The role of lipid rafts in cell infection by several herpesviruses including HSV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been investigated [1, 6, 7, 9, 25]. These findings show that these viruses resemble HIV in that both viral and PM cholesterol are required for virus infection. Recently, it is shown that M\u03b2CD-mediated cholesterol depletion of PM specifically impairs entry of PrV [4]. We have confirmed this finding and extended it (i) by relatively quantifying the cholesterol changes induced by M\u03b2CD-treatment and (ii) by showing that cholesterol dependence is not a strain-dependent feature of PrV entry. PrV Bartha strain is not only deleted in gE, but also in gI and in Us9 and mutated in gC, and differs in the genetic background from the other two PrV strains. In our experiments, these strains showed similar sensitivities to M\u03b2CD treatment and cholesterol replenishment, indicating cholesterol depletion from either cells or viruses affects the infectivity of PrV. From these data and those reported by other groups, it appears that requirement for cholesterol is a general feature for herpesvirus entry. Cholesterol-containing membrane microdomains may serve as specialized platforms for the initiation of infection. They may be especially important for herpesviruses where a group of surface proteins interact to achieve attachment to and penetration into cells.",

In this study, we found that the virions were more sensitive to M\u03b2CD treatment than cells as far as the initiation of infection is concerned. In the cholesterol assays, we found that the cholesterol content of both plasma and viral membranes was gradually decreased with the increase of M\u03b2CD concentration. The addition of exogenous cholesterol enhanced the cholesterol content of both membranes and restored virus infectivity in a dose-dependent fashion. The changes of membrane cholesterol are correlated with the PrV infectivity, supporting the conclusion that cholesterol dependence of PrV infection. Our recent report indicates that cell infection by transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), interacting with host cells via its S glycoprotein, is also dependent on the cholesterol in both plasma and viral membranes [19]. Compared with TGEV, there are more viral glycoproteins on the surface of PrV, and efficient virus infection may be mediated by one or more glycoprotein complex. Cholesterol may be an indispensable molecule involved in such process, nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the reduction in virus infectivity is a direct effect of cholesterol on PrV fusion activity.",

Like herpesviruses, in general, PrV matures by a budding process at membranes of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Intracellular membranes are known to contain less cholesterol than the plasma membrane. As the envelope of PrV is derived from an intracellular membrane, it is expected to have lower cholesterol content than a viral envelope derived from the plasma membrane. Therefore, lower amounts of M\u03b2CD are required to deplete cholesterol from the PrV envelope compared to cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane. This explanation is also consistent with our finding that M\u03b2CD treatment of infected cells, i.e. after the step of virus adsorption, did not affect virus infectivity.",
