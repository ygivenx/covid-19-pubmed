It is caused by orf virus (ORFV), which is an epitheliotropic parapoxvirus, the prototype member of the genus Parapoxvirus, family Poxviridae [1]. ORFV generally induces proliferative and self-limiting lesions around the mouth, teats and skin of affected animals, especially in young lambs [2].The mortality rate is as high as 93 % in kids when lesions of the lips and udders prevent them from receiving nutrition, thus leading to rapid emaciation [3, 4]. Outbreaks of orf have occurred in many countries where substantial numbers of sheep and goats are raised [5]. The disease not only causes huge economic losses to the sheep industry but also, as a zoonotic disease, poses a threat to human health [2].",

RNAi technology is not only a powerful tool for functional genomics studies but is also a potentially useful antiviral method, and it is increasingly being used to inhibit the replication of viral pathogens [10]. Therefore, it has been suggested that the preferred method for controlling the virus is to interfere with replication of the viral genome and the expression of viral genes. We designed specific siRNAs to target the DNA polymerase genes of ORFV in order to test whether RNAi could selectively target ORFV viral DNAs. This study provides not only an experimental basis for the development of a new anti-ORFV strategy but also a new approach for studying ORFV infection and replication.",

The correlation coefficient (R2) of the standard curve was 0.991, and PCR amplification efficiencies (E) were >0.96, with only one peak in all dissociation curves, thereby demonstrating the specificity and reliability of the analysis. The results indicated a significant reduction in the relative expression level of the viral genome per nanogram of total DNA, by 84 %, 89 % and 73 %, respectively, compared to the mock group at 48 h postinfection, when siRNA704, siRNA1017 and siRNA1388, respectively, were used (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "During RNAi, which is an RNA-mediated pathway of gene silencing mediated by small RNA molecules, introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) encoding a subsequence of a gene leads to reduction in expression of the corresponding gene in various organisms, including animals and plants [11]. Long double-stranded RNA is cleaved by an endonuclease (Dicer) into 21- to 25-nt fragments (small interfering RNA; siRNA), and these oligonucleotides can serve as guide sequences to direct a multicomponent nuclease to a specific messenger RNA to destroy it [12]. Studies of the antiviral activity of siRNA have shown that it is effective in the inhibition of viral infection and modulation of viral replication in cultured mammalian cells. Examples include HIV-1 [13], severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [14], hepatitis C virus [15], influenza virus [16], swine fever virus (Porntrakulpipat et al., 2010), goatpox virus [9], and Newcastle disease virus [17]. RNAi is increasingly being used to inhibit the replication of viral pathogens and is a promising approach for antiviral therapy in mammals. siRNAs can be introduced into mammalian cells by in vitro transcription or by transfection with chemically synthesized siRNAs to achieve effective and very rapid silencing of a target gene, although this approach is limited to cells that can be transfected at high rates, and the effects are transient [8]. The DNA polymerase gene, which is located in the central region of the genome of ORFV, is highly conserved within species and is a highly conserved gene that codes for the most conserved nonstructural protein, which catalyzes the replication of the viral genome and plays a primary role in viral replication [18].",

Our results demonstrate that the three siRNAs were highly capable of inhibiting viral DNA genome replication. Based on the replication kinetics of ORFV in OFTu cells prior to siRNA transfection and the peak period of viral proliferation (data not shown), the cell cultures for viral titration and DNA extraction were harvested at 48 h postinfection.",
