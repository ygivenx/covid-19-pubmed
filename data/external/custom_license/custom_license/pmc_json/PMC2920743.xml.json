TfR1 is a ubiquitously expressed, homodimeric, type II transmembrane glycoprotein that assists iron uptake into cells through endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin20. The dimeric ectodomain of human TfR1 (residues 89\u2013760) is a butterfly-shaped molecule with three subdomains: a \u201cprotease-like\u201d domain, related in structure to certain Zn-metalloproteases, an \u201capical domain\u201d, and a \u201chelical domain\u201d, which makes the principal dimer contacts21. Transferrin interacts with the protease-like and helical domains22, but does not interfere with the entry of MACV17. Mutational analysis implicates the TfR1 apical domain as the principal site of interaction with NW arenaviral GPs, and a short segment in the TfR1 apical domain (residues 208\u2013212) is a critical determinant of virus host specificity18,23.",

As anticipated, MACV GP1 binds TfR1 through an extensive network of contacts with the apical domain. The atomic details of the GP1:TfR1 interface clarify the importance of several receptor residues implicated in NW arenavirus host specificity. On the viral glycoprotein side of this interface, there is substantial amino-acid sequence variability among GP1 proteins that bind the human receptor. We correlate this variability with differences among the sequences of the host-species TfR1 orthologs, which can serve as efficient receptors for the corresponding virus18,23. The specificities of the viral glycoproteins reflect long-term adaptation of the viruses in their natural hosts24; our data suggest that the NW hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses independently and fortuitously acquired their ability to bind human TfR1 and hence to cause human disease.",

This segment was poorly defined in previous structures of hTfR121,25, which were determined to lower resolution (3.1 \u00c5 and 2.9 \u00c5), and re-analysis of the electron density in the unliganded hTfR1 structure (PDB ID 1CX8)21 in light of our higher-resolution model shows that residues 208\u2013212 in unliganded hTfR1 adopt a very similar \u03b2-strand conformation (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Thus, GP1 binding induces no major main-chain distortions in the TfR1 apical domain. It does, however, increase order in the extended \u03b2II-2 strand, displace the backbone and change the orientation of Leu209, and switch the rotameric state of Tyr211 (Supplementary Fig. 2b).",

In viral contributions to interaction motif 1, the hydrogen bond between MACV GP1 Ser113 and the phenolic hydroxyl group of TfR1 Tyr211 can also be made by the Thr at that position in SABV and by the Asp in JUNV and TCRV GP1 (Fig. 4b). GTOV and AMAV, however, have a hydrophobic residue at the equivalent of 113; a Glu nearby (replacing MACV GP1 Arg111) might accept the hydrogen bond instead. The residue at GP1 position 115, which lines the pocket occupied by TfR1 Tyr211, is Ile in MACV and JUNV, Leu in AMAV, and Val in TCRV, GTOV, and SABV. Residue 117, which contributes the other hydrophobic side chain lining the GP1 pocket for TfR1 Tyr211, is Val in MACV, JUNV, TCRV, and AMAV, Leu in SABV, and Pro in GTOV. MACV GP1 Arg111, which makes prominent contacts with the TfR1 \u03b2II-2 strand, is not conserved in any of the other viruses. In motif 2, TfR1 Asn348 has reciprocal hydrogen-bond interactions with the main-chain amide and carbonyl of MACV GP1 Ser116\u2014the side chain of this residue does not participate, nor is it conserved in any of the GPs. Interaction motif 3 is unique to MACV as it involves the insert in loop 10. In motif 4, three of five MACV GP1 residues that contact TfR1 are conserved in the other clade B1 viruses TCRV and JUNV, and four of five are conserved between MACV and JUNV. Substantial variability is seen in this motif, however, when GTOV, AMAV, and SABV are compared with the clade B1 viruses. In motif 5, Phe98 is replaced by a more polar residue in the other viruses, as might be expected, since absence of loop 10 would leave this phenylalanine substantially more exposed.",

TfR1 Asn348, which anchors the second interaction motif (Fig. 3b), is likewise conserved, except in CmTfR1 (JUNV host), which has a lysine at position 348. MACV cannot use CmTfR1 as a receptor, and the Asn348Lys substitution in the context of hTfR1 consistently disrupts the entry of MACV and GTOV into cells expressing this altered receptor18. The lysine at 348 would disrupt the hydrogen-bond network that includes the C-cap on TfR1 \u03b1II-2 and the main-chain hydrogen bonds with MACV GP1 Ser116 (Fig. 3b). Presumably JUNV, in adapting to the receptor of its native host, has evolved to accommodate Lys348 in binding to CmTfR1. In motif 3, the interaction unique to MACV, most of the receptors present a hydrophobic surface (valine or leucine at 210, and leucine at 212: Fig. 3c). The exceptions are Cm and AjTfR1. The former has a serine at 210 and a proline at 212; the latter, a glycine at 210. Loop 10 of MACV GP1 engages this hydrophobic surface, with MACV GP1 Phe226 inserted between the side chains of TfR1 residues 210 and 212. The details of the contact suggest that C\u03b3 of proline at 212 would clash with the Phe226 side chain, consistent with the failure of MACV to efficiently infect cells expressing CmTfR118; a glycine would not interfere, and MACV indeed infects AjTfR1-expressing cells efficiently23.",

Another difference in motif 4 is TfR1 residue 294, which is Asp in the host receptor for MACV (and also those for JUNV, GTOV, and AMAV), but Glu in hTfR1. An aspartic-acid side-chain at this position cannot reach the \u03b5-amino group of GP1 Lys169 (conserved in the clade B1 viruses), but the salt bridge can be replaced by one from TfR1 residue 340, which is Glu rather than Ala in precisely those receptors that have the aspartic-acid substitution at 294.",

The corresponding position is occupied by glycine in all NW arenavirus host-species receptors examined here, with the exception of the MACV host (CcTfR1), in which it is occupied by an asparagine (Fig. 4d). The Arg208Gly mutation converts hTfR1 into a receptor for TCRV23. Because most of the viruses are probably best adapted to the absence of a large side chain at the 208 position in TfR1, we asked whether an Arg208Gly change in hTfR1 also affects the infectivity of MACV, JUNV, and GTOV. We generated fusion proteins comprising the truncated GP1 subunits of MACV, JUNV, or GTOV fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (GP1\u0394-Ig)17 and tested them for binding to CHO cells transfected with wt-hTfR1 or hTfR1-R208G. MACV GP1\u0394-Ig bound CHO cells expressing either wt-hTfR1 or hTfR1-R208G, but bound the latter more strongly (Fig. 5a). JUNV and GTOV GP1\u0394-Ig bound only cells expressing hTfR1-R208G. Lack of detectable binding by JUNV and GTOV GP1\u0394-Ig to cells expressing wt-hTfR1 probably results from the low affinity of these proteins for the wild-type receptor. Consistent with these data, the R208G mutation modestly enhanced infectious entry of MACV pseudovirus, but led to substantial increases in infection by JUNV and GTOV pseudoviruses (Fig. 5b). The tip of the TfR1 apical domain (motif 5) is thus a determinant of entry by both pathogenic and nonpathogenic NW clade B arenaviruses. The rodent receptors all have a simple, four-residue \u03b2-turn in the \u03b2II-1/\u03b2II-2 loop, while human TfR1 has a five-residue turn. The pathogenic viruses (MACV, JUNV, and GTOV) have presumably adapted in their natural hosts to the shorter turn, which places a glycine at the 209 position instead of leucine. The substitution eliminates the hydrophobic contact we see between hTfR1 Leu209 and MACV GP1 Phe98 (Fig. 3e). The alternative interactions that we have suggested might be present in different virus-host pairs vary in character and position, and we therefore cannot readily predict from GP1 sequences alone how many amino-acid changes might be needed to make any particular nonpathogenic NW clade B arenavirus infectious in humans without compromising ability to propagate in its natural host.",

            "text": "The structure of MACV GP1 bound to human TfR1 reveals that NW clade B arenaviruses contact TfR1 on a surface with substantial sequence variability among viruses. This sequence variability, which presumably reflects the independent evolution of individual viruses in their various host-species24, is best illustrated by the insert in MACV loop 10, which forms extensive receptor contacts yet is much shorter and lacks these contacts in the other viruses (Fig. 3b). Nonetheless, a number of similarities among the GP1 receptor-binding domains strongly support the assumption of a shared fold within members of the family. Conservation of key receptor residues in several of the interaction motifs indicates conservation of local features of the interface, as well as of the overall docking of the two partners. The structure of the complex may therefore prove useful in predicting whether a novel NW arenavirus is likely to use TfR1. For example, extending the analysis shown in Figure 4 to the recently isolated NW hemorrhagic fever arenavirus Chapare suggests that this virus will indeed use TfR1 as its receptor (Supplementary Fig. 4)8.",

That loop is longer by one residue in human TfR1 than in its ortholog in any of the NW arenavirus native hosts, except for that of TCRV. Moreover, at the end of that loop, Arg208 in the human receptor becomes glycine in the host-species receptors (with the exception of the MACV host, where it is an Asn), and the Arg208Gly mutation enhances infectivity of JUNV and GTOV and allows infection by TCRV. The large arginine residue thus presents a barrier to use of human TfR1 by both nonpathogenic23 and pathogenic NW clade B arenaviruses (Fig. 5). The NW clade B arenaviruses appear to be adapted best to their host-species receptors. We suggest that those infecting humans accidently acquired the capacity to bind human TfR1 during co-evolution with the receptor in their natural hosts. The structure of MACV GP1 bound to hTfR1 thus clarifies the complex structural basis for the zoonotic transmission of this important class of emerging human pathogens.",

A segment unique to MACV GP1 is in red, with the Cys220-Cys229 disulfide bond in yellow. (d) Motif 4, at the lateral base of the TfR1 apical domain. An extensive network of polar interactions radiates from TfR1 Lys344. (e) Motif 5 at the lateral tip of the apical domain, centered on TfR1 Leu209. TfR1 residues Asp204 and Arg208, also shown, have been implicated previously in the host specificity of NW arenaviruses18,23. Asn95 is a conserved glycosylation site in NW arenavirus GP1s.
