What are the specific mechanisms for health improvement in ASEAN? What is ASEAN\u2019s modus operandi for health policy making and subsequently, how may those mechanisms be improved to build capacity and enhance cooperation for health among and within ASEAN\u2019s ten member states (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam). In sum, we look into ASEAN\u2019s potential for increased systematic cooperation within a complex world order (Rosenau 1992). ASEAN, as a young regional institution, experiences a certain degree of resistance from member states towards regional governance reforms that might impede on their sovereignty (Fidler 2007). Nevertheless, this regional body has a moral obligation to support the international framework for health improvement and this support may come in the form of an open method of coordination. For the Southeast Asian context, such a method of cooperation might be a good way to work around a rigid decision-making process.",

Globalization has affected working environments and consumption patterns leading to changes in lifestyles and well-being. Additionally, climate change along with recurrent natural disasters pose major health threats to the region. The main obstacle to health cooperation in Southeast Asia lies in the economic, cultural, and political differences between its ten member states. To overcome these disparities and tackle common health challenges as collective, Southeast Asian nations must look beyond national policy and towards the potential of ASEAN as a regional institution. Health is still largely considered as a national concern that is related to domestic issues. However, there is relevant scope for regional intervention to achieve common standards, as in the form of training and capacity building of health policy makers or the health workforce.",

With regards to the ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) for example, Indonesia continuously refuses to sign the convention due to the high revenues generated from taxes on tobacco and the close cooperation between the Indonesian government and multinational tobacco companies. This causes the whole region to lag behind in tobacco control. To overcome this prevalence of national interests over the common good which acts as a limitation to ASEAN\u2019s involvement in health improvement, member states must be prepared to pool their sovereignties further regarding health interests\u2014hence, pushing the movement for regional integration forward.",

The Charter created an ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) pillar focusing on health as well as the environment, education, welfare, and development. Among these new priorities, ASEAN seeks to \u201cenhance the well-being and livelihood of the peoples of ASEAN by providing them with equitable access to opportunities for human development, social welfare and justice\u201d (Tran 2011) striving towards the creation of an ASEAN Community by 2015. This is a clear sign of ASEAN\u2019s progressive involvement in health governance for the region whereby it recognizes that the region\u2019s capacity for development depends first and foremost on a healthy community achieved through collective effort. The ASCC blueprint establishes a strategic framework on health and development (2010\u20132015) to guide action in health governance and focuses on access to adequate and affordable healthcare, medical services and medicines, and promotion of healthy lifestyles. It seeks to improve the capability to control communicable diseases and pays a new attention to food quality control. The birth of the ASCC pillar and blueprint create the potential for a more integrative health governance framework in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, the current structure of cooperation and governance in health for Southeast Asia remains an emergent policy space that has not reached a stable institutional profile (Bradford and Linn 2007). It is challenging at this stage to track clear policy responses with nation states that reflect the blueprint recommendations directly.",

ASEAN\u2019s ability to guide regional action on health matters is thus limited by a decision-making process that is highly compartmentalized and bureaucratic. Furthermore, the long lapses of time between each stage of the decision-making process highly compromise its efficiency.

This recommendation is reflected with the new structure of the ASEAN sociocultural community pillar, whereby the health division is placed under the umbrella of the Cross-Sectoral Cooperation Directorate. This suggests that solution to health threats must be solved in parallel to other areas of attention under the sociocultural community pillar of ASEAN namely social and education policy, environmental sustainability, and disaster management. While the declarations that emanate from ASEAN official meetings are not legally binding, they do bear a lot of political pressure on the ten member states.

Both institutions could benefit from an institutionalized cooperation as they are complementary in nature. At the EU level for example, WHO provides the credibility of the content while Directorate General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) provides the tools by monitoring implementation through close scrutiny on national action and implementation plans. ASEAN, as an intergovernmental body, has the necessary tools to stir political commitment among its ten member states. Furthermore, ASEAN possesses the cross-sectoral value of a diplomatic entity with direct contact with all sectors of government in its member states, as well as with CSOs and the private sector. As a regional intergovernmental institution, it is a better candidate for identifying the specific needs of the Southeast Asian people and bridging the gap between WPRO and SEARO.

Such a division could oversee the creation of a stronger system of health indicators for the ASEAN community\u2014to allow for more successful harmonization of data collection and measurements, for example (European Commission, Together for Health 2007).",

The EU general health strategy for example was designed to improve health security (health preparedness, health promotion) by tackling health inequalities related to social determinants of health and by disseminating health knowledge and information. The general European Health strategy works through annual priority work plans\u2014and operates through an Executive Agency for Health and Consumers. Supplementing this European strategy is the Statement on Fundamental Health Values by the EC\u2014aimed at improving the coherence of the strategy by aligning member states on a similar value system for health improvement (European Commission Together for Health 2007). As such, we may suggest that ASEAN\u2019s potential in health governance could be improved by the creation of a more complex health division, more regular SOM and AHMM meetings, as well as a more resourced executive structure working towards the implementation of a general strategy for health, and supported by an ASEAN-specific statement on health values.",

Such a strategy helps to improve the coherence of policy recommendations between all actors for health in the EU and works to reinforce the regional institution\u2019s role as a global actor in health governance. The \u201cTogether for Health\u201d strategy also incorporates the Health in All Policies principle which calls for more synergy between the NGO sector, the industry, academia and the media. Now that ASEAN has integrated health as one of its priorities within the ASEAN sociocultural community pillar\u2014the next step towards incorporating health as a cross-sectoral priority could be to adopt an approach similar to Health in All Policies as clear mechanisms for cross-sectoral horizontal integration. The Reform Treaty of the EU (Article 9) reinforces this initiative by categorizing public health as one of three overarching objectives for the EU. All sectors of policy making at the national and regional levels must consider public health as a prime objective\u2014from social and regional policy, to taxation policy, environment policy, education policy, and to research. This is an example of horizontal integration\u2014as it promotes a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach (Kickbush 2011)\u2014with the intent of reaching all levels of the governance spectrum.

ASEAN\u2019s political commitment in EID control is apparent through the numerous working groups and task forces that were set up over the last 10 years. However, ASEAN does not benefit from a comprehensive surveillance mechanism (Coker et al. 2011) such as the European Centre for Disease Control that coordinates EID control activities with the EU commission and WHO EURO. ASEAN\u2019s sustained capacity to prevent and combat EIDs could depend on the creation of a clearly defined health strategy for the region. With regards to tobacco control, the EU provides strong leadership through the European coordination mechanisms which draw the link between FCTC requirements, WHO EURO initiatives and EU commission activities in tobacco control. ASEAN currently operates through its focal point on tobacco control set up in 2007. However, it could benefit from a more comprehensive and integrated strategy for tobacco control, to ensure greater coherence between WHO SEARO and WPRO initiatives and national government efforts towards tobacco control. Additionally, ASEAN involvement in tobacco control could largely contribute to reducing the disparities in health status between Southeast Asian nations as tobacco-related diseases account for the highest rate of preventable deaths across the region. From a development perspective therefore, a coherent strategy for tobacco control transposing the FCTC provisions to the national level via a regional initiative is essential.",

As a potential equivalent to the OECD, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) might be an interesting partner supplementing an ASEAN regional health governance framework, by supplying for example, the resources for improved surveillance. From the perspective of EID control, for example, working in closer synergy with APEC would allow ASEAN to harness the private sector stakeholders for EID control. We may note that APEC has previously worked to empower business leaders in the region by advising them on how to cope with the influenza virus through business continuity plans. This is a clear example of how APEC may supplement ASEAN\u2019s mechanism for EID control, or supplement a more general health strategy for the region in the near future.",

Additionally, DG SANCO has a representative stationed in Geneva for continuous exchange of information and expertise. Executive Directors of both DG SANCO and WHO EURO meet twice a year in January and May to discuss priorities in health security for the region, health information and solutions to health inequalities in the EU. In order to reinforce the cooperation between ASEAN and WHO regional offices therefore, both WHO WPRO and SEARO would ideally combine efforts to support a WHO regional office or unit based at the ASEAN headquarters in Jakarta. To implement a more systematic structure of cooperation, ASEAN may choose to work towards a joint agreement with WHO WPRO and SEARO, calling for more policy dialog. In order to elaborate on a complex matrix of cooperation\u2014WHO EURO and the EC have agreed on the need to include all EU delegations and WHO country offices in EU member states as direct partners on their health programs. This is an interesting idea for ASEAN and the WHO country offices. An integrated cooperation with WHO would allow the establishment of a single integrated information system for a uniform and efficient surveillance and alert mechanism, for example. The European region is currently working on such a system which will be based on standardized definitions and methods for data collection\u2014reducing the burden of data collection on member states.

The FCTC and the International Health Regulations serve as a template on which WHO regional offices and regional institutions may base their region-specific strategies for infectious disease and tobacco control. Regional offices of the WHO have taken the lead in establishing region-specific technical programs to strengthen national capacity. As we can see, WHO EURO works in a tripartite partnership with the EC and the European Centre for Disease Control for EID control. It is unfortunately much more difficult to impose such a structured framework for Southeast Asia due to its divided WHO membership. Although SEARO and WPRO have joined forces through the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases\u2014ASEAN would benefit from an institutionalized center for prevention and surveillance (such as the ECDC) to facilitate cooperation between its health division and the WHO regional offices. Furthermore; WHO EURO established a European Strategy for Tobacco Control and includes the EU as a main partner for this strategy. In contrast, the Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI) by WHO WPRO only includes ASEAN and WHO SEARO as collaborators.

The European Public Health Alliance (EPHA) for example, acts as a platform for all health CSOs to relay information to the European institutions. EPHA supports the flow of information on health promotion and public health policy developments among all players: politicians, civil servants, NGOs, stakeholders, and the public. EPHA trains, mentors, and supports NGOs and health actors to engage with the EU. This CSO platform therefore helps create the link between government and business and regional organizations. Having such a platform of CSOs would help to draw the link between health and social justice. Before such a platform can be created in Southeast Asia however, there needs to be a flourishing CSO landscape. The richness of the CSO landscape depends largely on the political structure and philosophy behind the governments of each member state. Governments of Southeast Asia have a role to play in facilitating the legal registration of CSOs in health.
