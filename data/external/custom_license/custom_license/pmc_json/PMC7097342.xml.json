Aside from Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of mice15 (see below), no spontaneous disease of other species resembles MS sufficiently to provide translatable insights into the disorder. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a family of disease models, is the most widely applied means of studying MS at the research bench. EAE was discovered about 85 years ago, during efforts to clarify the origin of 'neuroparalytic accident', a feared and common complication of vaccination against rabies virus. The vaccinating inoculum was prepared in tissue containing neural elements, and the tissue pathology of fatal cases did not resemble rabies infection. Therefore, one simple question was whether rabies virus was required for the syndrome. This issue was addressed by injecting nonhuman primates with tissue homogenates similar to those used for rabies vaccination, and the clear finding was that acute encephalitis could be produced by such immunizations16.",

Research milestones included showing that the histopathology of EAE resembled that of MS17, that white matter was more efficacious than gray for inducing disease and that myelin was the active principle in white matter. Myelin basic protein (MBP) was the first identified antigenic component, followed by many others, including myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein (MOG). Cells rather than serum were found to transfer disease to naive hosts18, leading to the finding that T cell clones could mediate paralytic inflammation19 and that these clones reacted to short peptides of myelin proteins16,20. Relapsing forms of EAE could be readily produced in some mouse strains, most prominently SJL/J (ref. 21).",

Using mice for EAE experiments entailed sacrificing neurobehavioral and neuropathological complexity, as well as restricting imaging studies (as can be gauged by comparison with the research done using marmosets22,23, for example). Most studies are presently done using C57BL/6 mice, where disease is induced by immunization with MOG peptide, representing residues 35\u201355, emulsified in Freund's adjuvant that is supplemented with Mycobacterium tuberculosis extract. Mice are also injected with pertussis toxin on the day of immunization and 2 days thereafter. This protocol is used because it works reproducibly and because it allows one to take advantage of the wealth of genetic resources on the C57BL/6 background but introduces an offsetting array of limitations. As examples of the information lost, this C57BL/6 model of EAE is monophasic, without relapses; the T cell component is predominantly CD4+; and spinal cord is affected out of proportion to brain, unlike in MS but in common with most other forms of EAE, although there are a few exceptions24.",

One major MS treatment came directly, in a mechanism-based fashion, from EAE research26. Other treatments, such as glatiramer acetate (a mixture of oligomeric peptides), were first studied in EAE, but their application in disease treatment has wandered fairly far from the initial rationale for their development20. For the most part, EAE has proven poorly predictive of treatment success in MS, particularly as concerns manipulations of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-23, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF27. The reasons underlying these misadventures remain under investigation, and it is by no means clear why cytokines with such central functions in immunity and inflammation perform so differently in MS than in EAE. It is plausible that humanized mouse EAE models will help to clarify some of these issues28.",

Further, well-performed mechanistic studies of myelin damage in EAE tissues have been vanishingly rare.Investigations using EAE to examine potential benefits of treatment with neuronal or oligodendroglial growth and survival factors has been disappointing. The prototypic finding has been that many factors regarded as 'neurobiological' exert remarkably strong effects on immune and inflammatory cells, making any results of treatment uninterpretable31.EAE is mainly a disease of subpial spinal cord white matter, whereas MS is mainly a brain disease with prominent demyelination of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. Involvement of the cortex in EAE has been difficult to discern and therefore not well studied.Most forms of EAE are generated by immunization regimens that elicit CD4+ T cell responses. The roles of CD8+ T cells, which predominate in MS lesions and show clonal expansion32, have been difficult to capture using conventional EAE models33.EAE studies have not been very productive concerning roles of B cells in MS34, despite recent clinical-trial data demonstrating their importance35.",

Oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum and hippocampus40 of cuprizone-fed mice undergo apoptosis after 3 weeks of treatment. After cuprizone is discontinued, remyelination ensues. This model provides insights into the determinants of oligodendrocyte cell death41,42.

The model has been used very productively to examine cellular and molecular determinants of remyelination45,46,47. The salient strengths of these directly applied toxins lie in isolating demyelination and remyelination as discrete events with spatiotemporal predictability48. Their weaknesses inhere in the absence of ongoing immune activity, as seen in MS. There is great promise of using the injection-based and cuprizone toxic models to identify strategies to enhance remyelination. Furthermore, the cuprizone model can likely be adapted for studying hippocampal demyelination or for identifying mechanisms of degeneration or survival by persistently demyelinated axons such as the ones seen after a 12-week course of cuprizone. Each of these features is urgent for expanding the treatment options for MS patients.",

The therapeutic landscape for MS patients is much richer for these efforts. However, the field lacks a focused, translatable disease model for progressive MS, which is at once the largest unmet need and the most difficult research problem for patients and their physicians. To balance this concern, it is important to note that each of the pathogenic processes listed above (inflammation, immunity, demyelination and remyelination) is pertinent both for relapsing (inflammatory) MS and for progressive (neurodegenerative) MS. Furthermore, aspects of CNS aging also are relevant for progression in MS, which is strikingly age dependent. Given these considerations, it makes sense for investigators to be explicit about which clinical aspects and mechanistic hypotheses are being modeled when their experimental data are presented. This approach would enable better understanding by readers of the intent of each research study. Ultimately, progress could be promoted by more efficient integration of results coming from many distinct approaches, in our efforts to understand a disease that integrates the complexities of the nervous and immune systems\u2014arguably the two most intricate structures we know.",
