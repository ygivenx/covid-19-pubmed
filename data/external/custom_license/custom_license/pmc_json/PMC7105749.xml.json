ACE2 interacts with the S1 domain of the viral S glycoprotein, and this interaction and the subsequent infection can be blocked by both a soluble form of ACE2 and their anti-ACE2 antibody [12]. ACE2 expression in cell lines correlates with their susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 must be a major receptor for SARS-CoV. This, in turn, suggests that the SARS-CoV S protein may be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention [13]. Interestingly, ACE2 expression positively correlated with the differentiation state of human airway epithelia; undifferentiated cells expressing little ACE2 were poorly infected with SARS-CoV, while well differentiated cells expressing more ACE2 were readily infected [14].",

Also, human monoclonal antibodies to the S1 protein domain block the association of SARS-CoV with ACE2, indicating that the ACE2 binding site of S1 could be a target for drug development [16]. A small-molecular-weight inhibitor that was found to interact with the ACE2 active catalytic site, (S,S)-2-(1-carboxy-2-[3-[3,5-dichlorobenzyl]-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-ethylamino)-4-methylpentanoic acid (MLN-4760) has been described [17].

Systemic peptide mapping has shown that the site of interaction between the HR1 and HR2 regions is between residues 916 and 950 of HR1 and residues 1151\u20131185 of HR2 [18]. It has also been shown that a peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibits SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range: CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the HR1 region, NP-1 (Figure 2)[19]. CP-1 could bind to the HR1 region, thereby interfering with the conformational changes leading to the 6-helix bundle formation (Figure 3) and the therewith associated virus\u2013cell fusion process. Obviously, the HR1\u2013HR2 interaction may be viewed as an attractive target for the design of potent peptide-type SARS-CoV entry inhibitors [20,21], reminiscent of the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) which has been developed as a HIV-1 fusion inhibitor [22]. The latter could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells, but apparently with too low efficiency to be therapeutically meaningful.",

In addition to calpain inhibitor III, some other calpain inhibitors have been described as inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication, the most selective (selectivity index >100) being calpain inhibitor VI (4-fluorophenylsulfonyl Val\u2013Leu[CHO]) (Figure 4)[24].",

It was proposed that compounds such as AG-7088, which had proven to be active against the rhinovirus 3C protease, could be modified in order to make them active against CoVs such as SARS-CoV [25]. As a first modification of AG-7088, the methylene group of the p-fluorophenylalanine residue was removed, and the resulting KZ7088 was modeled into the structure of the SARS-CoV Mpro [26].",

This helicase, akin to the herpesviral DNA helicase, also possesses NTPase activity, and may therefore be termed an NTPase/helicase. The SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase has been considered a potential target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV agents [43]. These agents could, in theory, be targeted at any of the three major domains of the enzyme, the N-terminal metal-binding domain, the hinge domain and the NTPase/helicase domain. Bananin (Figure 9) and three of its derivatives (iodobananin, vanillinbananin and eubananin) were shown to inhibit both the ATPase and helicase activity of the SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase, with IC50 values (for the ATPase activity) in the range of 0.5\u20133 \u00b5M [44]. Bananin was also found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK)-4 cells at an EC50 of less than 10 \u00b5M and a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of over 300 \u00b5M, thus exhibiting a selectivity index of over 30 [44].

This enzyme (Figure 10) does not contain a hydrophobic pocket for non-nucleoside inhibitors similar to those that have proven effective against the hepatits C virus (HCV) polymerase or HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [45]. In fact, non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors were shown to have no evident inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV RdRp activity [46]. It is intriguing that during purification, the full-length SARS-CoV RdRp was unstable and was hydrolytically cleaved into three fragments, a N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment and a C-terminal p64 fragment comprising the catalytic domain. The cause of the cleavage is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this cleavage also occurs in the viral life cycle [46]. At present, few, if any, nucleoside analogs have been recognized as specific inhibitors of the SARS-CoV RdRp. There is N4-hydroxycytidine, which has been accredited with both anti-HCV and anti-SARS-CoV effects. Against SARS-CoV it proved active at an EC50 of 10 \u00b5M (selectivity index \u2265 10) [24].

RNA endonuclease activity is unusual among positive-strand RNA viruses, suggesting that, because it specifically occurs during SARS-CoV replication, it could be considered a target for antiviral drug development. This pertains, in particular, NSP15, to an Mn2+-dependent endoribonuclease that specifically cleaves RNA at unpaired uridylate residues.

The results demonstrated that the vast majority of SARS-CoVs isolated thus far remain sensitive to 80R.

These observations were subsequently confirmed in several other studies [55\u201358].

The human MxA protein is one of the most prominent proteins induced by IFN-\u03b2.

Exogenous synthetic siRNAs can also be incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thereby bypassing the requirement for dsRNA processing by Dicer.

Thus, the selectivity index of ATA was estimated to be 187 [78]. The anti-SARS-CoV activity of ATA was tentatively attributed to an inhibitory effect on the viral RdRp [79]. It should be recognized, however, that ATA, which is commonly represented in its monomeric structure but actually occurs as a heterogenous mixture of polymers (Figure 13), is able to bind to, and inhibit, a variety of proteins and cellular processes [80,81]. ATA has since long been known as an inhibitor of HIV replication [82], and its anti-HIV activity is at least partially mediated by a specific interaction with the HIV cell receptor CD4 [83].",

Its EC50, determined by virus yield reduction in Vero cells, was 40 \u00b5g/ml (CC50 > 200 \u00b5g/ml; selectivity index >5) [86]. In comparison, mizoribine, which is also assumed to act in its monophosphorylated form, as an inhibitor of the IMP dehydrogenase, exhibited an EC50 of 10 \u00b5g/ml (CC50 > 200 \u00b5g/ml; selectivity index > 20) [86]. Although these findings do not legitimate the use of ribavirin or mizoribine (Figure 14A) as single agents in the treatment of SARS, they point to IMP dehydrogenase as a potential target for the development of more potent anti-SARS-CoV agents.",

Chloroquine (Figure 14B) was found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells at an EC50 of 8.8 \u00b5M (CC50 = 261 \u00b5M; selectivity index = 30) [88]. These inhibitory effects were observed when the cells were treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus [89].

Niclosamide (Figure 14C), an existing antihelminthic drug, was able to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero cells at an EC50 of 2 \u00b5M, while its CC50 was 250 \u00b5M; its selectivity could therefore be estimated at 125 [91].",

Thus, qualifying as potential anti-SARS drug candidates are some of the calpain inhibitors [23,24] and 3CLpro inhibitors, for example, the Phe\u2013Phe dipeptide inhibitor shown in Figure 7[38], which exhibited an EC50 of 0.18 \u00b5M and a selectivity index greater than 1000. Also, the octapeptide, AVLQSGFR, with an EC50 of 0.027 \u00b5g/ml (selectivity index >3700) [40] seems quite promising following the proposed criteria, and thus would be a number of the miscellaneous compounds such as valinomycin [69], niclosamide [90] and nelfinavir [91].",
