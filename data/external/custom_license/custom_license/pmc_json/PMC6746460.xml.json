            "text": "CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) is the N-terminal component of the pp1a\npolyprotein. Only \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs encode nsp1, whereas \u03b3-CoVs\nand \u03b4-CoVs lack this protein (6). Nsp1\nsequences identified using standard search tools, such as BLAST, are divergent among\ndifferent CoVs. The sizes of \u03b1-CoV nsp1 and \u03b2-CoV nsp1 differ; the\n\u03b1-CoVs encode nsp1 proteins of \u223c9 kDa, which are substantially smaller\nthan the \u223c20-kDa nsp1 proteins of \u03b2-CoVs. Although the sequence\nhomologies among TGEV, PEDV, and SARS-CoV nsp1 proteins are low, the core structures\nshare a relatively conserved domain (7\u20139). This high structural similarity may explain why CoV nsp1 has the\nconserved biological function of inhibiting host gene expression. However, the\ncritical region of \u03b2-CoV nsp1 required to inhibit protein synthesis is\ndifferent from that of \u03b1-CoV nsp1 (9\u201312). This difference could imply that the\ndetailed mechanisms through which CoV nsp1 proteins inhibit host gene expression are\nunpredictable. To date, the ability of \u03b2-CoV nsp1 to inhibit host gene\nexpression has been deeply studied. SARS-CoV nsp1 not only prevents mRNA translation\nbut also promotes its degradation by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit (13). Furthermore, MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively\ntargets mRNA synthesized in the host cell nucleus for degradation and thus inhibits\ntranslation in host cells (14). TGEV and PEDV\nnsp1 proteins cannot bind the 40S ribosomal subunit to inhibit the translation of\nhost mRNA; however, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 nsp1 proteins might bind the 40S\nribosomal subunit to affect host mRNA stability (9, 15, 16).",

            "text": "At present, the specific pathway by which \u03b1-CoV nsp1 inhibits host gene\nexpression is unknown. However, the function of CoV nsp1 in viral immune system\nevasion has been well-characterized in cell culture. For example, SARS-CoV nsp1\nsuppresses interferon (IFN) expression and host antiviral signaling pathways in\ninfected cells (10, 17). Furthermore, MHV nsp1 efficiently interferes with the type\nI IFN system (11), whereas PEDV nsp1 mediates\ncAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and NF-\u03baB\ndegradation to inhibit type II IFN responses (12, 18). Thus, nsp1 is considered\na possible major virulence factor for CoVs. Moreover, the contribution of nsp1 to\nCoV pathogenesis has been directly demonstrated for MHV and SARS-CoV (11, 17).\nHowever, little direct evidence has indicated that \u03b1-CoV nsp1 is a virulence\nfactor. Here, we present the crystal structure of full-length TGEV nsp1. Further\nstructural and biochemical analyses indicated that a motif (amino acids\n91\u201395) is important for the inhibition of host gene expression by \u03b1-CoV\nnsp1. In addition, we demonstrate that the loss of nsp1-induced inhibition of host\nprotein synthesis does not affect the replication of TGEV but can significantly\nreduce its virulence in piglets. This research improves our understanding of why\n\u03b1-CoV nsp1 is necessary for virulence and may aid in the development of a new\nattenuated vaccine.",

The details of the phasing and refinement steps are given in\nTable 1. Although the crystal\nresolution was very high, the specific conformation of the C terminus remained\nunclear. This was probably because the C-terminal loop was flexible, for which\nit is difficult to obtain accurate information. Structural characterization\ndemonstrated that the structure of full-length TGEV nsp1 displayed eight\n\u03b2-sheets and two \u03b1-helices (Fig.\n2A), and the full-length protein shared a common\nskeleton with the truncated protein.

Based on the\ncrystal structure of TGEV nsp1, we designed the following series of plasmids in\nwhich random coils were replaced with flexible Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly (sg) linkers:\nnsp1(1\u20133sg), nsp1(11\u201315sg), nsp1(19\u201322sg),\nnsp1(37\u201340sg), nsp1(46\u201348sg), nsp1(52\u201360sg),\nnsp1(66\u201369sg), nsp1(76\u201384sg), nsp1(91\u201395sg), and\nnsp1(105\u2013109sg) (Fig. 2,\nB and C). The Rluc assay showed that the\nloops comprising amino acids 37\u201340 and 91\u201395 were the most\nimportant regions for the ability of TGEV nsp1 to inhibit reporter gene\nexpression (Fig. 2C).\nSubsequently, Western blot analysis indicated that nsp1(91\u201395sg)\nexpression was significantly higher than nsp1 expression (Fig. 2C), again demonstrating that nsp1\ncould inhibit its own expression (9, 15). We examined Rluc mRNA expression in\nHEK-293T cells by real-time quantitative PCR and found that TGEV\nnsp1(91\u201395sg) and TGEV nsp1(37\u201340sg) did not inhibit Rluc mRNA\nsynthesis at different time points (Fig.\n3A). We conducted the ribopuromycylation assay, and\nthe results showed that TGEV nsp1(37\u201340sg) significantly reduced the\ninhibition of host gene expression (Fig.\n3B). Because the TGEV nsp1(37\u201340sg) protein\nwas found to be insoluble in the Escherichia coli supernatant,\nthe motif (amino acids 37\u201340) was not analyzed further. Based on the\nabove experiments, we focused on TGEV nsp1(91\u201395sg). Finally, the\nribopuromycylation assay demonstrated that the mutant protein no longer\ninhibited host protein synthesis in a dose- or time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and\nD). These data indicate that the motif comprising amino\nacids 91\u201395 is critical for TGEV nsp1\u2013induced suppression of host\ngene expression.",

Envelope proteins affect virulence, and\nan attenuated virus with envelope gene deletion is a promising vaccine candidate\n(28\u201334). Although many viral proteins can induce host translational shutoff,\nnsp1 was the first CoV gene 1 protein recognized to play an important role in\ninhibiting host gene expression to regulate viral replication. In \u03b2-CoVs,\ndeletion of the functional region of nsp1 will be critical for developing attenuated\nvaccines (11, 17, 35). However, the role of\nnsp1 in \u03b1-CoV pathogenesis is unknown. In our study, we replaced the important\nmotif in the TGEV nsp1-coding sequence using our reverse genetics technology. Then,\nwe successfully recovered the mutant virus. Subsequently, the viral growth and peak\ntiters of the mutant virus in susceptible cells were found to be indistinguishable\nfrom those of the WT virus, indicating that the nsp1 gene was not a\ncritical factor driving viral growth in cell culture (Fig. 6, D and E). To confirm this\nconclusion, we also tested the nsp1 expression level during viral infection and\nfound that it was indistinguishable between the mutant and WT viruses (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the\nanimal experiments revealed that the determinant region within TGEV nsp1 was\ncritical for viral virulence based on gain-of-function studies. Taken together, the\nresults of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that loss of \u03b1-CoV\nnsp1\u2013induced inhibition of host gene expression does not affect viral\nreplication but significantly reduces virulence.",

            "text": "Among the four CoV genera, only \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV encode nsp1. Previous\nstudies have indicated that the mechanisms by which nsp1 suppresses host gene\nexpression may differ among CoV species (13\u201315, 36). The mechanisms\nof nsp1-induced host gene suppression have been well-characterized for \u03b2-CoVs.\nNsp1 proteins of bat CoVs have been shown to bind viral RNA and to suppress host\ntranslation (37). SARS-CoV nsp1 uses a\ntwo-pronged strategy to inhibit host gene expression by first interacting with the\n40S ribosomal subunit and then inactivating translation (13). MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targets transcribed mRNA to\ninhibit host gene expression (14). MHV nsp1\ninterferes efficiently with the type I IFN system to enhance virulence (11). Nonetheless, structural analysis indicates\nthat CoV nsp1s have a common origin (7\u20139)\nand that the nsp1 proteins of \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs share a biological\nfunction to inhibit host gene expression. Furthermore, previous studies have\nrevealed that the C terminus of MHV and SARS-CoV nsp1 is an important functional\nregion for inhibiting host protein synthesis (10, 11). However, the conserved\nimportant domain underlying the \u03b1-CoV nsp1\u2013induced inhibition of host\ngene expression is unclear. Although we have reported that the loops at amino acid\npositions 67\u201371, 78\u201385, and 103\u2013110 generate a stable\nfunctional region (9), this functional domain\nis not present in the TGEV nsp1 protein (12).\nTo identify the common functional domain in \u03b1-CoV nsp1, we selected TGEV nsp1\nas a model. Although the structure of a truncated TGEV nsp1 (PDB code 3ZBD) has been reported (8),\nwe wondered whether the C terminus could affect the overall structure. Subsequently,\nwe determined the structure of full-length TGEV nsp1. Structural characterization\nrevealed that full-length TGEV nsp1 shared a common skeleton with truncated nsp1.\nThese similar conformations suggested that the C terminus had no influence on the\noverall structure of TGEV nsp1. Although the 37\u201340 mutant protein\nsignificantly reduced the inhibition of host gene expression, the mutant virus with\nnsp1(37\u201340sg) was not successful. Although a previous study has also reported\nthat 5\u2032-UTR of coronavirus can effect viral replication (38), we are not sure whether the rescue failure\nof this mutant virus is due to the loss of nsp1 activity or the effect of\n5\u2032-UTR. Through structural analysis and biochemical experiments, we verified\nthat the motif comprising amino acids 91\u201395 was necessary for the inhibition\nof host gene expression by nsp1. Interestingly, this motif could be expanded to\nother representative \u03b1-CoV nsp1 proteins (Fig.\n5). In our study, we found that the motif comprising amino acids\n91\u201395 is a conserved region in \u03b1-CoVs, which is conducive to\nunderstanding the mechanism of \u03b1-CoV nsp1 inhibition of host gene\nexpression.",
