            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the common cause of liver diseases worldwide and a major public health problem (Bisceglie 1998). The disease hepatitis C was first recognized in 1975 and the causative agent HCV was identified in 1989. Hepatitis C is characterized by an acute, often asymptomatic stage, followed in most cases by chronic infection that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV, which causes hepatitis C in humans, is a small, enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. Replication of the RNA-based virus involves the use of the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that has a high error rate. Consequently, the virus mutates very rapidly and has no single genotype. Currently, there are seven known genotypes of HCV (Jawaid and Khuwaja 2008; Torresi et al. 2011). According to World Health Organization, nearly 3 % of the world population has been infected with HCV. An estimated 170 million people globally are infected with chronic HCV and are at risk of developing liver cancer/cirrhosis, while nearly 350,000 people die worldwide as a result of hepatitis C-related liver diseases each year (Waheed et al. 2009; Jiwani and Gul 2011).",

Only about 15 % of cases display mild symptoms such as decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, muscle or joint pains, and weight loss. The infection resolves spontaneously in 20% of the cases. About 80% of the people exposed to HCV, however, eventually develop a chronic infection, thus progressing to the chronic stage of the disease. This stage can last for decades. Most people experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few years of the infection. After several years of living with the disease hepatitis C becomes the primary cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Nearly 5\u201320 % of chronic hepatitis C patients develop cirrhosis over 30 years and 1\u20135 % die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a rate of 13 % per year. It is estimated that hepatitis C is the cause of 27 % of cirrhosis cases and 25 % of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (Bisceglie et al. 1991; Fattovich 1997; Kiyosawa 1990; Hutin 2004).",

The response to treatment also varies by genotype and ranges from 70\u201380 % for genotypes 2 and 3 to almost non-existent for genotype 6. Also, recent treatment advances of genotype 1 infection using directly acting antiviral agents are encouraging; there is still a need to develop an effective vaccination strategy capable of preventing infection. The vaccines used in clinical and pre-clinical trials include recombinant proteins, DNA-based proteins, synthetic peptide vaccines, etc. The implementation and success of the above-mentioned vaccines along with future designs of vaccine strategies have been discussed in detail by Toressi et al. (2011). Furthermore, the high cost of the therapy results in low clinical usage.

Screening at blood transfusion has resulted in a significant decline in HCV transmission, especially in the developed world. However there are countries lacking resources where screening costs have posed a hinderance to blood screening for HCV (Alter 2007). The primary route of transmission in the developed world is IDU, while in the developing world HCV is predominantly spread through unsafe blood transfusions and therapeutic procedures (Maheshwari and Thuluvath 2009). The HCV prevalence among IDUs is greater than HIV [67, 72.5 and 73.4 % among the IDUs in China, Russia and the USA, respectively (Nelson et al. 2011)]. The World Health Organization declares IDUs as an important target group for HCV treatment and prevention (Nelson et al. 2011). Among IDUs in USA and Europe, transmissions occur via sharing injection equipments such as syringes, needles and other paraphernalia (Mathei et al. 2006). Both modes of HCV transmission (unsafe blood transfusion and IDUs) are significant for certain communities [studies indicate prevalence percentages of 48.67 \u00b1 1.75 % and 57 \u00b1 17.7 %, respectively, in Pakistan (Waheed et al. 2009) see also Ali et al.

It was estimated that there were about 5 million drug users in Pakistan, out of which 15 % were regular IDUs. In contrast to the US, where the majority of HCV infections are caused by genotype 1 of HCV, an overwhelming majority of hepatitis C patients in Pakistan are infected with genotype 3a of the virus.

Most of these papers classify individuals in the population into different states and then formulate a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) to analyze the time evolution of each of these population states. Reade et al. (1998) has discussed an ODE model of infections with acute and chronic stages. Similarly, Luo and Xiang (2012) analyzed a four state system with exposed, acute and chronic states. Suna et al. (2012) has analyzed an SEIRS model where it was assumed that recovered individuals lose their infection-acquired immunity. Martcheva and Castillo-Chavez (2003) have formulated a model for hepatitis C lacking an exposed class and have discussed the stability of the equilibrium states. Dontwi et al. (2010) considered the transmission of hepatitis C through IDUs in an acute, chronic and recovered model. Other deterministic models pertinent to our work have also been proposed and analysed (Busenberg and Hadeler (1990);  Esteva and Vargas (1999); Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez (1995); Hethcote and Thieme (1985); and Hethcote et al. (2002)).",

            "text": "We present a deterministic model with two distinct susceptible population groups comprising IDUs and those getting blood transfusion (unsafe needles in healthcare setting etc.), respectively. So we are considering the transmission of hepatitis C among these two population groups (representing two distinctive modes of transmission). Individuals in each group are classified as susceptible, acute, chronic, quarantined and recovered. The acute and chronic states represent the individuals in the acute and chronic stage of the infections, respectively. The quarantine state represents the chronically infected individuals getting quarantined. The isolation of those with disease symptoms is among the first infection control measures ever recorded (Hethcote 2000). Over the course of time, quarantine strategy has been used to combat the spread of many emerging and re-emerging human diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, Ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, SARS (Chowell et al. 2004; Yan et al. 2007; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2003). Luo and Xiang (2012) has performed a global analysis of a four-state \u2018susceptible\u2019, \u2018exposed\u2019, \u2018acute\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019 model and proven certain theorems regarding the stability of the steady states of the model. However, almost no analysis of the effects of a quarantine class on a disease with a chronic stage has been done and therefore, our paper will be one of the first attempts to study the effect of quarantine (education campaigns, self quarantine etc.) on the spread of a disease with a chronic stage. It should be pointed out that quarantine or isolation here is not being considered in the traditional sense. Quarantine involves only the isolation of individuals who have been exposed to the disease. Since hepatitis C is largely asymptomatic, and chronically infected individuals can live for years without being identified, a quarantine class can be used to consider individuals who have been clearly identified as being infected with HCV. Such individuals can then undergo treatment for HCV and take extra precautions while interacting with the people around them (self quarantine). The notion of quarantine introduced also includes the educational campaigns to spread awareness about HCV, its transmission modes and how to proceed if infection is identified, free supply of needle to intravenous drug users. Such quarantine strategy can potentially play a significant role in hepatitis C control by decreasing the effective contact rate.",

These parameters were chosen because of high correlation with the R\n0 as shown by the sensitivity analysis. From the contour plot, we see that if \u03b2\n1 is larger, then R\n0 is always greater than one, which implies that it is important to control the effective contact rate. Figure 6b shows that the basic reproductive number may be less than one if \u03b1\n1 and \u03b2\n1 can be restricted to a range, leading to the potential extinction of the disease.

On the other hand, \u03b1\n2 is at the maximum value initially and then it sharply decreases before getting to the minimum value of 0. In fact, at the beginning of simulated time, the optimal controls are staying at the upper bound to quarantine as many chronically infected individuals as possible to prevent the infected population from increasing. The steadily decreasing of the control pairs is determined by the balance between the cost of the infected individuals and the cost of the control facilities.

It is clear that with the use of an optimal control strategy disease epidemic can be prevented and disease remains under control at all times. Figure 9 shows the cost associated with the optimal and constant control strategy. It is clear the costs of optimal strategy are much less than the cost of relatively low (but practically feasible) constant control and in fact differ by order of magnitude of tens. It is important to note that high constant quarantine rate (\u03b1\n1,\u03b1\n2 = 0.4) incurs almost the same cost as of optimal control. However, practically it is highly unlikely to implement these high constant controls primarily due to the lack of required resources and facilities.\n\n",

In our analysis we assumed a quadratic cost function due to obvious non linearity of the cost as briefly discussed in the optimal control section, and the fact that convexity of the function allows one to apply established results from optimal control theory, as has been done in similar work in the literature. Using techniques from optimal control theory we concluded that An optimal control (rather than a high constant control) is preferable, where quarantining rate of chronically infected individuals is a function of time. That is, the proportion that is quarantined optimally with respect to time has a higher favorable impact (as compared to implementing a high but constant quarantine rate) in keeping the cost of disease control low.However, it should be pointed out that the ideal time-varying optimal strategy might not be applied easily. Still, it does provide a basis on which to design practical quasi-optimal control strategies\n",
