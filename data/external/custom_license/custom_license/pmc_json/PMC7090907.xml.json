            "text": "Early 2003, the world was startled by a new infectious lung disease, which was later called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In a few months, over 8,000 people got infected and 774 people died of SARS [1]. The majority of deaths occurred in Asia, but in Canada, 43 deaths occurred, which could all be traced back to two cases who imported SARS from Asia [1, 2]. Asia has also been more heavily affected during recent years by avian influenza. By July 2007, this infectious disease caused over 250 infections and 176 deaths within Asia, compared to 40 infections and 16 deaths in other regions [3]. Scientists fear that a mutation within the virus that enables human-to-human transmission might occur, and such a pandemic could result in millions of deaths worldwide [4]. Future outbreaks of avian influenza and SARS\u2014which is caused by a virus of suspect animal origin\u2014are likely to start in densely populated regions where humans live in close contacts with livestock and poultry, such as in large parts of China/Asia [5]. Through international air travel, further spread to the rest of the world including Europe is very likely. In case of such outbreaks, public health authorities will need to convince the general public to adopt precautionary behavior such as taking prophylaxis, wearing facemasks, and adhering to quarantine and travel restrictions [6].",

For example, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, Chinese people in Europe and the US did not always consider information for general populations to be appropriate. They, therefore, turned to media from China and Hong Kong and sometimes adopted precautionary behavior that was targeted at people living in China [7, 8]. In case future outbreaks originate in Asia, Asian minorities living in Europe may be at higher risk of infection than general populations in Europe due to their own travel behavior or their contact with people from affected Asian countries. A Dutch study on travel behavior of Chinese living in The Netherlands showed that, in 2003, the year of the SARS outbreak, one third of Chinese respondents had traveled to Southeast Asia and one fifth had received guests from this region (de Zwart et al., unpublished manuscript). Timely informing these ethnic minority groups is of utmost importance to prevent spread of the disease, inappropriate behavior, and discrimination.",

These concepts are derived from the Protection Motivation Theory, which posits that people\u2019s motivation to engage in precautionary actions is influenced by the perceived threat, that is, the severity of the disease and the perceived vulnerability [9\u201311]. High perceived threat will only lead to adoption of precautionary behavior if a person believes that effective protective actions are generally available (the perceived response efficacy) and that one\u2019s self has the ability to engage in such protective actions (the perceived self-efficacy). The choice of information sources may determine people\u2019s knowledge related to health risks and precautionary actions. This knowledge in turn may determine health beliefs. On the other hand, high perceptions of vulnerability may promote the use of more sources of information.",

Our study was an add-on to a qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGD; [7]). The UK and The Netherlands were chosen because these countries have large Chinese communities of 297,000 and 145,000 people, respectively [12]. Also, comparison data from the general population were available for these countries. The findings of the study among the general populations are reported separately elsewhere [13]; in the present paper, they only serve as a comparison group for the Chinese in the UK and The Netherlands.",

In The Netherlands, community members were addressed during meetings of Chinese community groups such as women\u2019s groups, church/temple groups, a youth group, and a school. In the UK, respondents were also recruited through snowballing contacts of selected participants and by newsletters. A purposive sample design ensured diversity in background by setting recruitment targets for sex, age, country of origin, length of residence in Europe, and occupation. In the UK, respondents who met the criteria were invited to take part in a FGD at least 2 weeks in advance by letters; recruiters contacted them by phone days before to remind them. In The Netherlands, respondents were asked during the recruitment to participate in a FGD, which was planned a few days later. FGDs in both countries took place between October 2005 and April 2006. Results of the FGDs are presented elsewhere [7].",

In The Netherlands, participants were given a pen-and-paper questionnaire at the beginning of the FGD, to be completed on the spot before the FGD started.

It was a descriptive, epidemiological study without strong a priori hypotheses. There are several limitations to our study. Firstly, we used the snowball technique to sample Chinese in the UK/The Netherlands, whereas we used random sampling for the general population; the comparison of the two groups may, therefore, be biased. Nevertheless, probably because we recruited Chinese people in the UK and The Netherlands in very diverse settings and used purposive sampling with recruitment targets, our respondents seem to reflect the Chinese communities in the two countries quite well. Also, the random samples of the general populations may not truly have been representative; participation rates in The Netherlands and the UK were 44% and 21%, respectively. We tried to reduce biases in sampling by adjusting all outcome measures for differences in socioeconomic background variables. Secondly, we used slightly different methods to collect the questionnaire data from the British/Dutch Chinese compared to the general groups. However, previous studies have found little differences in responses to CATI compared to pen-and-paper questionnaires [16, 17]. Thirdly, because our study is one of the first studies to make investigations of information sources, risk perceptions, and (other) beliefs related to recently emerging infectious diseases in various populations, the questionnaire that we used was not validated, it only had a limited number of items per construct, and it was pretested with cognitive interviewing only among general populations in the UK and The Netherlands. Nevertheless, the questionnaire seemed to be well-understood by the Chinese respondents, considering that the proportion of missing values was low (both on average 4% missing values per question). Because this proportion did not differ between British and Dutch Chinese, the rephrasing of some questions by the focus group moderator in The Netherlands seemed not to have influenced the item response rate. Fourthly, about half of our respondents were participants of FGDs, and they may have been motivated to participate in such a discussion because they were more worried/felt more vulnerable about SARS and avian flu than nonparticipants. Our explorative study can, therefore, be seen as a first step toward more comprehensive and representative studies on differences in risk perceptions and health beliefs. Lastly, data collection took place 2 years after the end of the SARS epidemic, which may have resulted in recall bias. We tried to minimize this by not referring to the outbreak in 2003 but instead always refer to \u201cin case of an outbreak\u201d.",

These Chinese language media were regarded as more trustworthy than local European media because the content was in-depth and updated regularly [7]. Use of information targeted toward Chinese groups that was available from British and Dutch public health organizations was low, even though some of this information was provided in the Chinese languages, such as British/Dutch websites for the Chinese communities [7]. Our findings are in line with a study from the US that shows that Asian communities were getting more and more timely information from sources in Southeast Asia than from US news media or health officials [8]. The only British/Dutch source of information that was well-used and well-trusted was the British/Dutch TV. Overall, Chinese people seemed to have made more use of sources of information than general populations from the UK and The Netherlands, which may have resulted in their better knowledge regarding SARS.",

It seems, therefore, wise for British/Dutch health authorities to use special TV broadcasts for Chinese groups to inform the Chinese community in their countries, taking into account news coverage in locally available Chinese media. It should also be explored whether informal networks can be used, such as Chinese community groups and Chinese peer educators. It is also important to increase awareness of and confidence in more formal sources of information, such as from the government, so that their information targeted toward Chinese and other vulnerable groups is well-used.
