Pfizer's MEK inhibitor had already passed phase 1 safety trials as a candidate cancer treatment before research into it was discontinued. And chemotherapy drugs, such as the MEK inhibitor, would be even safer as influenza treatments, Planz says, because it would take much lower doses and shorter treatment times to interfere with influenza's activation of normal proteins than those needed to block mutant proteins in cancer. Atriva derived its own formulation of the compound, called ATR001, to increase cellular uptake of the drug. The company plans to test ATR001 in a phase 1b study in the next year and a half. And Planz says that a phase 2 challenge study, in which volunteers will be purposefully infected with the flu before undergoing treatment, will not be far behind.",

In 2007, the three scientists' teams reported that the compound, which blocks the signaling protein's activity, consequently blocks viral replication, in part by preventing ribonucleoproteins from leaving the cell nucleus5. The German drug company Ventaleon licensed the idea, which the three had already patented, and, in partnership with the UK-based pharmaceutical company Vectura, Ventaleon conducted the phase 2 trial of hospitalized patients with severe influenza. The results of the trial, which ended in May 2015, have not been published, but Planz presented the data at last year's international influenza meeting in M\u00fcnster. The findings showed that oseltamivir, when administered in combination with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor and taken three times a day, alleviated flu symptoms more rapidly than treatment with oseltamivir alone. The drug is inhaled, and so its effect is local and transient, which makes it a safe way to inhibit NF-\u03baB.",

For example, Ansun BioPharma in San Diego has been developing a drug that prevents influenza virus from taking its first step into lung cells. The drug, DAS181, is a fusion protein that binds to lung epithelial cells and catalyzes a reaction that causes molecules called sialic acids, which the virus uses to engage cells, to fall off the cell surface. By lopping off the virus's docking sites, the compound can prevent several strains of influenza from infecting cells and mice9,10.

While working in his lab at the University of California, San Francisco, Lingappa's sister, Jaisri, found that viruses can co-opt parts from cellular machines and reassemble them, Frankenstein-style, into viral-capsid assembly lines. She showed that HIV, for example, needs the host-cell protein HP68 to make its capsid11. Prosetta, which Vishwanath Lingappa founded in 2002, studies this process in test tubes, a design that makes it possible to screen for compounds that specifically block the Frankenstein-like forms of host proteins, and, in turn, the production of new viral capsids. In 2013, Lingappa and his colleagues used this approach to select compounds that prevent the rabies virus from producing capsids, and they found that the same compounds could also block viral infection of cells12. Prosetta has identified about a dozen drugs that block influenza virus capsid assembly, and has taken one drug through cell culture and animal studies. Lingappa says that the same compound can also block respiratory syncytial virus in rats and coronavirus in pigs.",

In a study published last September, his team reported that both cell lines and mice were more susceptible to infection early in the day, thanks in part to lowered levels of a cellular protein called BMAl1, which notably also wanes in human blood cells during winter months13.",
