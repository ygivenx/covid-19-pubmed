PPV is among the most common and important causes of infectious infertility in pigs and can result in significant economic losses to the swine industry. It is one of the few viruses that can survive in the environment for extended periods of time and is refractory to most disinfectants. Currently, there are no viable treatments for the disease. Vaccination is effective, but cost and safety issues have been deterrents to routine vaccination in many regions of the world.",

PPV strain PPV2010 was propagated in ST cells in the absence of serum and used for infection analyses [5, 19].

Cell monolayers plated onto 96-well culture plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); then, DG (Zhengda Pharmacy, China) was serially diluted twofold in serum-free DMEM and added onto the wells (5 wells per each dilution). Mock-treated cells containing no DG were used as negative controls. The cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h, supplemented with 80 \u03bcl per well DMEM and 20 \u03bcl per well 0.5 % MTT solution and then incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. After washing with PBS, 150 \u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well. The plates were shaken gently for 15 min to dissolve the formazan precipitate, and the OD570 was recorded. Cell survival rates were calculated from mean values according to the following equation: (OD570 drug)/(OD570 control) \u00d7 100. Deoxycholate (DOC) (Sigma, China) was serially diluted twofold beginning with 2 mg/ml in serum-free DMEM and added to the ST cell monolayers cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h to observe cytopathic effects.",

As example, dissimilar effects on viral replication were observed on cultured HIV isolates depending on whether or not the isolate was a syncytium-inducing variant. This difference was linked to the ability of glycyrrhizin to induce certain \u00df-chemokines in the cultured cells used to propagate the virus [20]. Glycyrrhizin inhibited early stage replication of HAV and the penetration of HAV into the plasma membrane in PLC/PRF/5 cells, an Alexander hepatoma cell line, but exhibited no virucidal or inhibitory effects on the adsorption of HAV [4]. In a guinea pigs model, one group found that intravenously administered glycyrrhizin bound to hepatocytes and modified the expression of HBV-related antigens on the hepatocytes and suppressed sialylation of HBsAg. This was proposed as one mechanism by which intravenously injected glycyrrhizin improves liver function resulting in occasional complete recovery from hepatitis [21].",

Significant differences were, however, observed between the cell and virus control groups (P < 0.01). The effect of DG on PPV-infected cells indicated that DG also significantly reduced the infectivity of PPV where the cell survival rate was 74.8 % (Fig. 1b). When PPV pre-treated with DG was used to infect ST cells, a significant decrease in infectivity was observed where the cell survival rate was 96.4 % (P < 0.01) relative to controls (Fig. 1c). The results of this treatment regimen were confirmed by IFA. As shown in Fig. 2, PPV-infected ST cells generated strong fluorescence signals by 48 h post-infection. In contrast, the fluorescence from ST cells infected with DG-treated PPV decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Although the inhibitory effects of DG on PPV-infected cells were lower than those observed on the DG-pretreated virus, high cell survival rates are still important because under most circumstances the antiviral therapy will be used on animals which have been previously diagnosed as positive. Given the difference between the cells pretreated with DG and washed, versus the cells treated with DG post-infection with virus, it is possible that the DG internalized by the cells is functioning intracellularly to bind to and inactivate viral particles within the cells. Indeed, current research is being targeted at finding ways to bind DG to nanoparticles to help better internalize the drug and target specific cell types [17, 25] As such, the presence of DG may have a meaningful effect on the virus even after it has entered the cell.\n\n",

Indeed, it has been reported recently that the oral bioavailability of glycyrrhizin could be improved by formulation of this drug in association with sodium DOC/phospholipid-mixed nanomicelles (SDC/PL-MMs) [9]. To further support the specific nature of the activity, when the PPV group was treated with DOC the fluorescence signal was not diminished; this observation was quantified by RT-PCR. The results showed that relative amplification of the PPV-derived NS1 gene decreased in a dose-dependent manner to a maximum of 92.3 % in the presence of 250 \u03bcg/ml DG and this coincided with a decrease in PPV infectivity (Fig. 3).

This suggests that the activity of DG is more direct than indirect where contact with the virus is essential to prevent infectivity. This contrasts with hypotheses suggesting that DG interaction with cell-related factors such as viral receptors is critical for preventing infection. This also suggests that maintaining sufficiently high levels of DG will be necessary to prevent any progeny virus from infecting new cells and propagating the infection after a short latent period. This is important and beneficial as a therapeutic drug for PPV. This can be seen in Fig 1b where DG was used to directly treat virus-infected cells for an extended period of time (72 h) during which multiple rounds of virus replication would have occurred. Based on these observations, it becomes important to identify the mechanism of binding of DG to PPV as well as other viruses in order to advance development of newer, more effective therapies against viruses known to be affected by DG treatment. In conclusion, DG has negligible adverse effects on ST cells. Further, this study reveals that DG exhibits direct inhibition on PPV in vitro and may be considered an effective anti-PPV agent.",
