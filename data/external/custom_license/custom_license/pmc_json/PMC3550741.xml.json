            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus, distantly related to parvovirus B19. HBoV was first detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [1]. Recently, it has also been identified in blood and in fecal samples from patients with gastroenteritis [2, 7, 20, 25]. However, the role of HBoV in human infectious disease is unclear due to the frequent detection of this virus in association with other respiratory viruses (RV) with a recognized pathogenic role in ARI. Indeed, like other members of the family (e.g. Parvovirus B19), HBoV can be shed asymptomatically during a prolonged period [23]. Some studies have suggested that the determination of HBoV load in respiratory specimens could be useful for clarifying the role of HBoV in acute respiratory infections (ARI) [7, 23].",

Firstly, we excluded the presence of HBoV to divide the study population in two groups. One group comprehended cases positive for non-HBoV viruses (n = 552) and the other group included cases negative for non-HoV viruses (n = 848). Subsequently, HBoV detection rate was calculated in both groups. HBoV was detected in 69 (12.5%) and 108 cases (12.7%) of cases positive and negative for non-HBoV viruses, respectively (P = 0.935).",

Routine investigation of these viruses included antigen detection and/or viral culture by SV. Our detection rate of these RV in HP is lower than the reported in other studies [3]. The methodology may have contributed to this difference. Many virologists are currently using molecular assays for RV detection, which are more sensitive than cell culture. Indeed, molecular assays have allowed the detection of newly-identified RV that do not grow or grow poorly in cell culture, some of which have well-defined etiologic roles in respiratory tract infection, as occurs with hMPV. These methods have led to frequent co-detections [10].

Thus, a HBoV-positive result cannot not probably give the same information as the detection of other viruses such as RSV, hMPV and FLU in terms of clinical significance. Our results demonstrated that HBoV detection was independent of the presence of other respiratory virus, since the same detection rates of HBoV were observed in cases with and without other virus. And contrarily, respiratory viruses such as hMPV, RSV and FLU, recognized as causal agents of ARI were detected more frequently alone than with other virus. Other previous studies have compared the presence of HBoV in patients with ARI and control groups [7, 11, 26]. In one study [26], high HBoV detection rates were detected in children <1 year though no significant differences were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In another study, HBoV was detected in children with pneumonia, but this clinical finding was associated more probable to codetection of other viruses [7]. Finally, Kesebir et al. [11], detected HBoV in patients with ARI and negative for RSV, FLU, PIV and ADV, compared to asymptomatic individuals. However, HBoV was investigated by PCR and the other viruses, by direct fluorescence assay; thus, these viruses could have been underdiagnosed because a less sensitive detection method was employed by the authors.",
