Further, 4E showed the greatest ability to inhibit the production of\ninfectious virions. Interestingly, 4E also affected not\nonly the ability to make infectious virions but also severely limited\nthe intracellular replication of the virus, as can be visualized via\nGFP production from the proviral plasmid in HEK 293T producer cells\n(Figure 5).
