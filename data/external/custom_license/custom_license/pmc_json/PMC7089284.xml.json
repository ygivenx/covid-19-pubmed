This disease affects chickens of all ages and causes respiratory stress, interstitial nephritis in broilers, and reduces egg production. The etiologic agent of IB is the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, subfamily coronavirinae, genus gamma-coronavirus that replicates primarily in the respiratory tract and also in some epithelial cells of the gut, kidney, and oviduct [2]. Currently, dozens of IBV serotypes and genotypes have been described, and natural outbreaks of IBV are often the result of infections with strains that differ serologically from vaccine strains.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 27.6 kb [3\u20135] possessing at least ten open-reading frames (ORFs) organized 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 as follows: 5\u2032-Cap-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3\u2032PolyA [6]. Six mRNAs (mRNA 1\u20136) are associated with viral replication. Four structural proteins including the spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M),and nucleocapsid protein (N) are encoded by mRNA 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively [7, 8]. mRNA1 consists of ORF1a and ORF1b, which have 42 overlapping nucleotides (nt) and encode for two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, via a ribosomal frame-shift mechanism [9]. During or after synthesis, these polyproteins are cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsp2\u201316), one of which is the polymerase. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved at protease cleavage recognition motifs into the amino-terminal S1 (92 kDa) and the carboxyl-terminal S2 (84 kDa) subunits by cellular proteases [10]. The putative protease cleavage motifs are usually associated with one or more pairs of basic amino acids (e.g., Arg\u2013Arg\u2013Phe\u2013Arg\u2013Arg M41) [11]. The multimeric coiled-coil S glycoprotein extends from the viral membrane, and the S1 subunit is anchored to the viral membrane by the S2 subunit [12]. Proteins 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b are encoded by mRNA 3 and mRNA 5 and are not essential to viral replication [3, 7, 8].",

These results further indicated that IBV isolates that are prevalent in China were significantly evolutionarily distant from Mass-type strains. However, IBV vaccine strains commercially used in China today are primarily derived from Mass-type strains such as H120, H52, Ma5, and W93, which may not be able to provide efficient protection against field strains.

Many recombination regions have been detected for IBV isolates, including E, RdRp, PLpro [5], the 3\u2032 S1 terminus, the 3a gene [27], TRS [28], the 5\u2032 M terminus [29], the 3\u2032 S2 terminus, N regions, and the 3\u2032 UTR region [11, 30]. Presently, \u2018hot spots\u2019 are generally believed to be located adjacent to putative crossover recombination sites, including C(T/G)TAACAA [28, 30], CTTTTG [31], CTTTT(C/T) [29], and other A-T-rich regions.",

Recombination event breakpoint analysis showed that sequences C(T/G)TAACAA, CTTTTG, and CTTTTG(C/T) were not found near recombination regions. Therefore, it was difficult to determine whether these motifs were associated with recombination. Further analyses will be needed to determine the roles of these motifs in recombination events; however, previous studies have suggested that recombination in IBV occurred randomly rather than at specific sites [32].",
