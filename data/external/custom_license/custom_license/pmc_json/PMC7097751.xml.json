The US FDA advisory committee later recommended that each trial should be re-evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Suspicions that the retroviral vector, and not the modified gene, was responsible for the effect were confirmed by a study showing that in both cases the vector had integrated near a promoter for LMO2, which encodes a transcription factor required for haematopoiesis, and led to the uncontrolled clonal proliferation of mature T cells. Such non-random insertion suggests either a 'physical hotspot' of integration at the LMO2 locus or, more likely say the study authors, that random LMO2 insertion confers a selective advantage on cell proliferation.",

Billed as the most potent statin available, it received approval in more than 30 countries, including the United States, for hypercholesterolaemia. By the end of November, rosuvastatin had 3.45% of the US new prescription market for statins, which the company said was in line with its expectations. However, Germany, Spain and Norway withdrew from the approval process owing to safety concerns, in a situation similar to the cases of rhabdomyolysis observed with cerivastatin (Baycol; Bayer) before its market withdrawal. In addition, an editorial in The Lancet in November criticized AstraZeneca's campaign to promote rosuvastatin, noting that the marketing data are based on trials for which there are surrogate endpoints, but no clinical endpoints, whereas the use of the current most popular statins \u2014 simvastatin (Zocor; Merck) and atorvastatin (Lipitor; Pfizer) \u2014 is supported by large trials with clinical endpoints. AstraZeneca's CEO, Sir Tom McKillop, responded that such data have never been available for other cholesterol-lowering medicines at launch, and that the company submitted for approval the largest clinical database for any statin.",

SARS affected a reported 8,098 people, with 774 patients killed, and spread to many countries, including Singapore, Canada and the United States, making it the first epidemic to be transmitted by air travel. The World Health Organization's declaration on 15 March that the outbreak was a worldwide health threat triggered an unprecedented international effort to identify the causative agent and highlighted the technological advances that have been made in many research techniques. Compared with the two-and-a-half years it took to identify HIV as the causative agent of AIDS, within a month a coronavirus was identified as the infectious agent of SARS and genome sequences of the virus were obtained less than one month later. In May, the SARS-coronavirus main protease structure was obtained for the design of anti-SARS drugs, and in December a vaccine was successfully tested in rhesus macaques. The transmission of SARS has been stopped because of aggressive quarantine measures and possibly by rising summer temperatures, but as yet there is no definitive information on the animal source of the virus and when, or if, SARS will re-emerge in humans.",

The immediate fallout from this acquisition was that the chief executive of Pharmacia, Fred Hassan, left to become the chief executive of Schering-Plough, a company that has faced plummeting sales and legal investigations into its disclosure and pricing practices. Hassan, who brought with him his experience of turning American Home Products and Pharmacia around, immediately outlined his plan. This involved settling legal investigations with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the creation of a team of executives and a global and integrated manufacturing supply chain, and a cut in payroll expenses by 10%.",

This was highlighted by the approval of two widely anticipated first-in-class drugs; enfuvirtide (Fuzeon; Roche/Trimeris) for HIV and bortezomib (Velcade; Millennium) for multiple myeloma. Enfuvirtide, approved in the US in March and in Europe in May, is a linear 36-amino-acid peptide that blocks the entry of HIV-1 into cells by inhibiting viral and cell membrane fusion. Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the proteasome, the key component in the degradation of unwanted or misfolded proteins that are thought to be overproduced in cancers. Bortezomib was approved on the basis of Phase II data just eight years after it was discovered \u2014 a sign that regulatory authorities are willing to push through compounds for which there is a large unmet clinical need.",

But in a decision that will affect all manufacturers of such gene chips, the FDA informed Roche on 29 October that the chip requires FDA marketing clearance or approval. The problem is that Roche had marketed the product as an analyte-specific reagent; that is, limited to the detection of a single analyte or a set of reagents for laboratories to use in creating their own diagnostic tests, which do not require premarket applications. But the FDA believes that the AmpliChip is an assembled device that is part of a specific test system, and will require a clinical demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which could take three years to complete.",

The recently discovered process, in which genes can be silenced by small RNAs, took the biology world by storm due to its novelty, elegance and efficiency. Start-ups were quickly formed to create therapeutic applications of RNAi, and in July two of the biggest companies in this field, Alnylam and Ribopharma, merged. July also saw the publication of the first of two papers published in 2003 that raised questions about the specificity of RNAi. Both showed that the RNAs used to silence genes could also activate genes in the interferon-response pathway, which triggers global inhibition of endogenous messenger RNA translation and leads to apoptosis. The effect of the interferon response in vivo is not yet certain, and many reasons have been proposed for the observations: for example, high concentrations of RNAs might affect what is a natural, saturable system. Nevertheless, in September, Merck and Alnylam entered the first major collaboration between a pharmaceutical and an RNAi company to develop therapeutics.",

Louis Lasagna, the founder of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development and widely regarded as the creator of clinical pharmacology, died on 6 August. Lasagna revolutionized drug evaluation and regulation by promoting randomized controlled clinical trials as the gold standard, and argued that it was essential to consider the placebo response in trials. On 1 April, David Horrobin died. One of the central themes of Horrobin's research was the role of fatty acids in disease, such as neurodegenerative disorders. A passionate, persuasive and often controversial man, Horrobin was the founder and editor of Medical Hypotheses, which allowed the dissemination of new ideas in medicine, and was a strong voice in highlighting inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, Paul Janssen, creator of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, died on 11 November (see editorial in this issue).",

The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement established at the Doha meeting in November 2001 gave countries facing public health crises the right to override patents on vital drugs and order generic alternatives, but only from domestic producers. In an emotional plea, African negotiators overcame last-minute hitches by stressing that 2.2 million Africans had died of AIDS and other epidemics during an eight-month deadlock in the talks. The new agreement allows poorer countries to import generic drugs when necessary, but lists a number of rich countries that will refrain from importing generics and less-rich countries that will import them only in circumstances of extreme urgency. Almost instantly, Brazil authorized the importation of generic antiretrovirals, and the Canadian government announced in late September that it would amend patent laws to allow manufacture of generic medicines.",

Around three-quarters of drugs on the market have not been tested in children and are used off-label, with clinicians obtaining dosing regimens from extrapolation of data from adults to children. Companies were not required to test medications in children until the FDA adopted the Pediatric Rule in 1998. But in October 2002, a federal court overturned the rule on the grounds that companies could not be required to study indications that they did not want to study. The FDA said that this in effect reduced children to an indication rather than a disenfranchised group and the same could be applied to, for example, ethnic minorities or pregnant women. Instead of appealing, the FDA successfully relied on Congress to codify the rule into law.",

However, news of the pipeline resulted in shares dipping slightly by 1%, as investors were disappointed by the lack of late-stage compounds. Merck, which has refused to pursue the consolidation route, found itself in the unusual situation of terminating two Phase III compounds in the space of two weeks \u2014 aprepitant, a substance P antagonist for depression, and MK-767, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3 agonist for diabetes.
