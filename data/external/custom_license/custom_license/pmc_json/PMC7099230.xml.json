Epidemiological analysis and mathematical models played a crucial role in informing public health policy and contributing to the control of the outbreak.6, 7, 8 Effective international collaboration and data sharing facilitated rapid completion of most of the essential tasks, including identification of the aetiological agent.9",

The 1918 influenza epidemic spread extremely rapidly and killed 20\u201340 million people worldwide. The world population has more than tripled since 1918, so high population densities, as well as increasing domestic and international travel, may facilitate such a pandemic. Improved surveillance, technological advances, and an increased understanding of epidemiology together enable societies to prepare for a range of possible pandemic scenarios. National governments and the WHO are monitoring human and avian cases of H5N1 and other novel strains,4 antiviral treatments are being produced in large quantities for stockpiling by governments10 and novel vaccines are being developed to protect against the avian form of the virus and being stockpiled by governments.10 Despite these precautions, the exact characteristics of a potentially pandemic strain which may emerge cannot be predicted exactly, although ranges can be estimated from previous pandemics.11, 12, 13 Therefore, it is essential to understand how the effects of such an outbreak might be contained, or at least mitigated, for a range of scenarios. Complex, often individual-based, models of influenza outbreaks, informed by re-analysis of previous pandemics, are being used to inform the design of public health strategies should a strain emerge which is capable of human-to-human transmission.2",

When there are small numbers of cases and R0 is large, there is a small probability that the epidemic will \u2018fade-out\u2019 after only a few infections because the early cases recover before infecting enough other individuals (Figure 2a). This probability of fading out before the epidemic takes off becomes smaller as R0 gets larger. If R0 is less than one the outbreak will surely die out. Infections with reproduction numbers close to, but exceeding, one are potentially easier to control than infections with reproduction numbers much larger than one.",

The higher the transmission rate of the disease per unit time and the longer the duration of the infectious period, the larger the R0. A disease which is highly infectious for a short period of time may have the same basic reproduction number as a disease that is not as infectious but has a much longer infectious period. For diseases with similar characteristics the basic reproduction number is different for each population, as the opportunities for onward infection are affected by the contact patterns of a population. In a city where most people commute to work by public transport, for example, the opportunities for onward transmission of an airborne pathogen may be much greater than in less densely populated areas. For many directly transmitted diseases, such as measles1 and pandemic influenza,11\nR0 is usually assumed to be similar in unvaccinated populations. For sexually transmitted diseases, large differences in sexual behaviour within populations can lead to estimates of R0 for heterosexual populations from 2 for low risk populations17 to over 10 for high activity groups and sex workers.18",

If, however, the infection takes hold, the number of new cases grows exponentially.1 The rate at which the number of cases will grow during this early stage, r, is dependent on both the reproduction number and the generation time of the infection, and can therefore be used to estimate the basic reproduction number. For a homogeneous population with onward infection occurring throughout the infectious period as R0=rTg+1, but there are other formulations for different model assumptions.1, 19, 22, 23 As for the basic reproduction number, the relationship between the epidemic growth rate, the serial interval, and the basic reproduction number is more complex for heterogeneous populations.14, 19 In Figure 2c I have used this equation to estimate R0 from first month of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (Figure 2c). The best fitting straight line to the log incidence data gives a growth rate, r, of 0.15 per day (equivalent to a doubling time 4.6 days). The generation time of SARS, Tg, has been estimated to be 10 days from data on the number of days between the start of symptoms for individuals who infected each other.7, 24 We can now use the equation above to get an estimate of the basic reproduction number for SARS as R0=1+0.15 \u00d7 10=2.5. This relatively simple calculation gives a similar estimate to those made by more sophisticated methods.7, 21, 25",

The success of these strategies has been shown to be crucially dependent on the proportion of transmissions which occur before infected individuals show symptoms.26 Isolation of a proportion of symptomatic individuals can control an outbreak provided this proportion is large enough for that infection.26 Normally circulating influenza is believed to be infectious before the infected individual is showing symptoms,38 which makes control extremely difficult. If, however, the disease is mainly transmitted to close contacts, for example family members, then contact tracing may be manageable and effective. If transmission is likely for more casual contacts, contact tracing is much more difficult. Contact tracing has also been shown to depend on the degree of variability in the timing of infectiousness between different infected people in the population.39, 40 Before large amounts of resources are allocated, it may be important to assess the effectiveness of such a policy early in an epidemic through analysis of transmission chains and the impact of the intervention on the effective reproduction number.",

The minimum proportion of the population that must be vaccinated to prevent a large outbreak is 1\u22121/R0 for homogeneous populations.1 (There are also expressions for heterogeneous populations.41) This proportion is higher for diseases with large R0.

Because of the short doubling time of influenza epidemics, these strategies would have to be implemented when there are very few cases. One such responsive strategy \u2013 implementing travel restrictions and prophylactic treatment of everyone within 10 km ring of each case \u2013 would require a stockpile of approximately 3 million courses of antiviral drugs to contain an outbreak of pandemic influenza.11 Following the publication of this analysis by Ferguson et al, Roche donated 3 million doses of their antiviral drug to the WHO for this very purpose and the WHO has set up project to develop protocols for practical implementation of containment.",

Public health measures, including screening and travel restrictions, can be put in place to slow this spread. The effectiveness of such methods, however, is dependent on the characteristics of the disease. If an infection has an incubation period which is longer than the duration of a flight then infected people are unlikely to develop symptoms during a flight. Thus even 100 per cent effective entry screening is unlikely to be useful in identifying cases.45 Imported SARS cases caused new outbreaks only in the early stages of the global outbreak, because of effective exchanges of information about the disease, the lack of pre-symptomatic infectiousness, and local outbreak control. If an outbreak is uncontrolled, then the number of new cases continues to grow exponentially and sheer weight of numbers means that cases will be exported. Travel reductions of greater than 99 per cent will be required to slow the spread of influenza.43, 44, 46, 47 Strategies aimed at protecting the public from pandemic influenza should focus resources on surveillance and rapid control of outbreaks wherever potentially pandemic strains arise.48",
