Since 2015, healthcare-associated transmission has decreased as infection prevention and control practices have improved (6); however, sporadic cases continue to be reported, often associated with contact with dromedaries (4,7). Surveillance and routine investigation of recent MERS cases are critical to monitor the epidemiology of this emerging pathogen. We characterized exposures and demographics of MERS cases reported to the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health during July 1\u2013October 31, 2017, and June 1\u2013September 16, 2018, and performed molecular characterization of available specimens to describe circulating viruses during these periods.",

For deceased or unavailable patients, we interviewed proxies. We did not conduct interviews for cases reported during June 1\u2013September 16, 2018; this period was selected because of specimen availability.

Nine (15%) cases were associated with a hospital outbreak, 10 (16%) were household contacts of known cases, and 42 (69%) were classified as sporadic and further investigated.

All were symptomatic and hospitalized; 22 (52%) died. During the exposure period, 21 (50%) sporadic case-patients reported camel contact: 12 had direct contact (touching), 5 indirect contact (visiting a setting with camels or exposure to others with direct camel contact), and 4 contact that could not be further classified. Among patients with camel contact, 6 also reported visiting a healthcare facility without a known MERS-CoV outbreak for a reason unrelated to their subsequent MERS illness. Of the 21 sporadic case-patients without camel contact, 8 (38%) visited a healthcare facility without a known MERS-CoV outbreak, 5 (24%) denied high-risk (camel- or healthcare-related) exposures, 1 (2%) was reclassified after interview as a contact of a previously identified case-patient, and 7 (17%) had insufficient exposure data to further characterize.",

This clade included a sequence from a 2018 case-patient from Saudi Arabia who traveled to the United Kingdom. Sequence variability among the 2018 viruses supports the disparate geographic origin of these cases.

Tree inferred using MrBayes version 3.2.6 (https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes) under a general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with 4 categories of \u03b3-distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites. Box at the top of the tree on the left shows location of the tree on the right, showing lineage 5. \u03941 indicates 3-nt in-frame deletion in open reading frame 4a and \u03942 indicates 66-nt in-frame deletion in open reading frame 1a. Clade-credibility values >70% are indicated at selected nodes. Sequences from this study include GenBank accession numbers MK462243\u2013MK462256 and MK483839. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site. MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Hu, human; KSA, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.",
