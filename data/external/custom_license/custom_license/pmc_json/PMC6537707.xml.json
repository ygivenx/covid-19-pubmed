We observed a holiday effect for the Chinese Spring Festival (occurring in late January or early February) each year. A sharp decrease in sample number and samples positive for RSV were observed each year during this event, resulting in a bimodal distribution curve (Figure 1, panel B). Overall, 785 (62%) RSV-positive samples were RSV-A and 485 (38%) were RSV-B. Although almost equal numbers of RSV-A and RSV-B were identified in 2013\u201314, we assigned 2013\u201314 as an RSV-B\u2013dominant season for modeling purposes. This assignment does not subvert our findings that subgroups A and B alternate biennially. Each RSV subgroup dominated for 2 consecutive years during our study period, for a total of 4 years each (RSV-A during 2007\u201308, 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, and 2014\u201315; RSV-B during 2008\u201309, 2009\u201310, 2012\u201313, and 2013\u201314) (Figure 1, panel B).

The percentage of PCR tests positive for RSV each week throughout the summer months typically exceeded 3% but was <10%; once the 10% positivity threshold was exceeded, the percentage of tests positive for RSV increased rapidly. Overall, 97% of RSV-positive PCRs occurred within the period defined by the 10% threshold (Table 3; Figure 3). Using the 10% cutoff point and a fitted seasonal curve, we determined the following RSV season parameters for each of the 8 years of our study: season onset (first of 2 consecutive weeks during which RSV positivity in seasonal curve exceeded 10%), duration, peak (week with highest RSV positivity in seasonal curve), offset (last week that RSV positivity in seasonal curve exceeded 10%), and percentage of RSV-positive samples captured within the season. Data show that the average season onset occurred at calendar week 41 (mid-October) and lasted 33 weeks, through week 20 (mid-May) of the next year (Table 3). The peak of RSV activity occurred at calendar week 3 (mid-January). RSV circulated at low levels during off-seasons. Overall, 24 (3.3%) of 724 children tested were positive for RSV in summer, a finding consistent with Broberg et al. (13). Variations in RSV activity were observed from year to year (Figure 4). RSV activity in 2007\u201308, 2011\u201312, and 2014\u201315 (RSV-A\u2013dominant years) peaked early (during calendar week 1) and in 2009\u201310 and 2013\u201314 (RSV-B\u2013dominant years) peaked late (calendar week 7, in February). In general, the RSV season started earlier (RSV-A week 40 vs. RSV-B week 45), lasted longer (RSV-A 34 weeks vs. RSV-B 28 weeks), and peaked earlier (RSV-A week 2 vs. RSV-B week 5) in RSV-A\u2013dominant seasons than in RSV-B\u2013dominant seasons (Table 3).",

During the 8 consecutive years of the study, the number of children admitted with pneumonia dropped from 718 in the first year to 282 in the last; RSV positivity also decreased remarkably, from 280 in the first year to 41 in the last. The reasons for this decrease might be attributable to a decrease in the occurrence of RSV-associated pneumonia in the pediatric population or, more likely, a fall in pediatrician interest for enrolling patients into the study over time, given we did not observe a simultaneously drastic drop of pneumonia cases in the hospital (Figure 1, panel A). Moreover, the demographic characteristics of patients also differed throughout the study years. In the first study year, more children 28 days\u20135 months of age (42%) were enrolled, and in the last, more children >5 years of age (43%) were enrolled. Despite this change, the observed seasonal characteristics in each year changed little if any, indicating that viral factors rather than demographic factors had more of an influence over RSV seasonality. When study years were classified by the prevailing RSV subgroup, the observed season onset, peak, and offset showed good reproducibility. We found that >90% of RSV-positive PCRs could be captured during the RSV season for all 8 study years, and the average capture was 97% for 2007\u20132015 combined. The method we used in our study (PCR-based testing) can be used by local hospitals in China where surveillance data are lacking to compile the extensive amount of data needed to assess RSV seasonality.",

These shifts have been shown to be strongly associated with changes in the dominant RSV strain circulating (11,25); however, this phenomenon has not been investigated in detail. Similar to previous studies (8,26,27), the positivity for RSV-A (19%, 785/4,225) was significantly higher than that for RSV-B (11%, 485/4,225; p<0.001) in our study. The season onset and peak in RSV-A\u2013prevailing years occurred \u22483\u20135 weeks earlier and duration was \u22486 weeks longer than those observed in RSV-B\u2013prevailing years. The response plot showing the effect of year on RSV activity also indicated patterns of regular peaks in the years RSV-A prevailed (i.e., 2007\u201308, 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, and 2014\u201315), but the effect of the year diminished when RSV-A\u2013prevailing year was adjusted for as a factor in the model, suggesting that repeated shifting between RSV-A and RSV-B might play a substantial role in driving RSV transmission dynamics in populations. This observation is also supported by a model proposed by White et al., who found that the transmission rate of RSV-A (8%) was slightly higher than that of RSV-B (25). Just like the influencing factors explored in other studies (e.g., geographic latitude and longitude, social and demographic factors, population density, and climate) (11,13,22), RSV subgroup replacement might play a key role in the activity of RSV. The alternating nature of RSV subgroups could explain the alternating early-big or late-small pattern and year-to-year variation in epidemic size and timing of RSV transmission observed previously (11,25). Our finding that RSV subgroup shifting was associated with RSV activity suggests that when using RSV seasonal data or conducting RSV surveillance, one should pay attention to the prevailing subgroups in the season to optimize the timing of immunoprophylaxis. This finding indicates the significance of genotyping in RSV surveillance.",

A monotonic decreasing effect on the activity of RSV with age was observed in the response plot (Figure 5, panel A), indicating that younger age is a risk factor for RSV infection. Children who were in their first months of life had the highest risk for RSV infection (3,30). Administration of 1 dose of palivizumab (15 mg per kg body weight) each month for 5 months has been recommended to protect children at high risk for severe respiratory infection (e.g., preterm infants and infants with CHD in their first year of life) (12). As of March 2019, palivizumab is not licensed for use in China, and no immunoprophylaxis is available to prevent severe RSV infection. One third (30%) of children in our study with pneumonia requiring hospitalization had RSV infection; this finding is similar to previous estimates of 28%\u201334% in other countries (1,2). Considering the high positivity rate of RSV in children with pneumonia, RSV-associated illness should be considered a high priority for public health authorities in China. Our study of the relationship between age and RSV infection gives urgency to developing RSV diagnostics and indicates the need to study long-lasting and high-affinity new therapeutics and vaccines in the future (9,31).",

Because no national RSV seasonality data were available for comparison, whether our results could represent other regions in China with an RSV burden is unknown. However, overall, our data are comparable with those observed in the United States. In addition, a previous study conducted in 15 countries of Europe showed that RSV seasons peaked later and lasted longer with increasing latitude (13). Because China is a large country that spans several geographic zones and climates, further studies are needed at other locations to fully characterize RSV seasonality in China. Second, our study was conducted in children with pneumonia, a population that usually has a high RSV positivity rate. Seasonality should also be evaluated in children with mild symptoms and in adults. Third, we did not evaluate the size of the local hospital or the minimum number of tests needed each year to conduct a more reliable analysis of RSV seasonality. Fourth, we excluded children without fever from our study. Because illness caused by RSV can manifest without fever, particularly among infants (32), the case definition used in our study was suboptimal, and we might have missed some children infected with RSV. Considering no international RSV case definition exists (13), we encourage researchers in future studies to determine a working case definition that can balance the many attributes (e.g., accuracy, feasibility, flexibility, and usefulness) of the various definitions that have been used to conduct RSV surveillance or study disease burden.",
