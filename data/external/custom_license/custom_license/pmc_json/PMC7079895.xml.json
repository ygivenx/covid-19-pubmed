            "text": "The etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerging worldwide in 2003 has been identified as a novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of about 29,700 nucleotides, encoding a RNA-directed RNA polymerase and structural proteins including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003; Ruan et al. 2003). The N protein is a 422-amino-acid alkaline protein with a short lysine-rich region suggested as the nuclear localization signal. It plays an important role in the process of virus particle assembly by enveloping the entire genomic RNA (Marra et al. 2003). The SARS-CoV N protein has been suggested as a potent antigen for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection (Timani et al. 2004). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that the N protein can induce a T-cell response to SARS-CoV infection (Gao et al. 2003); and thus the N protein is also important in the development of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection.",

LAB-based vaccines can effectively achieve mucosal and systemic immunization at mucosal sites, which are the entry routes of many pathogens including SARS-CoV and HIV. For instance, Lactococcus lactis has been used as a vaccine delivery system for the HIV Env protein. Oral administration of this recombinant vaccine antigen induces strong HIV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses which significantly reduce the viral load following challenge with an Env-expressing vaccinia virus (Xin et al. 2003).",

For easy use of this protein in mucosal vaccination, we expressed this protein in the food-grade bacterium L. lactis. First, the production of the recombinant SARS-CoV N protein in L. lactis NZ9000/pCYTN was analyzed before and after nisin induction. The protein extracts from cytoplasm and the medium were both subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting assays with the anti-N antibodies prepared above. In the absence of nisin, no signal was detected, indicating that no recombinant N protein was produced (data not shown). After 6 h of induction with nisin, the results showed that recombinant N protein was present in the cell cytoplasm fractions as expected (Fig. 4a). However, the expression level of N protein in this strain was usually subject to variable induction efficiency. To overcome this inconvenience, we then constructed a novel recombinant strain, L. lactis MG1363 harboring an expression plasmid pSECN, in which the n gene was fused with the coding sequence of USP45 signal peptide and was controlled by the constitutive L. lactis promoter P59. Western blotting showed that a prominent band of 46 kDa corresponding to size of the mature N protein was observed in the medium, indicating that the SARS-CoV N protein can be secreted by this recombinant L. lactis strain; and only a few secreted N proteins were degraded (Fig. 4b). However, nearly 60% of the N protein precursor was still in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4b). Thus, expression of the recombinant N protein in both cytoplasm and medium was realized by strain L. lactis MG1363/pSECN, rendering it suitable for both oral and intranasal administration.",

Although many ELISA diagnostic kits have been invented basing on a viral protein mixture, it does not seem convenient in its preparation, because it requires the cultivation of SARS-CoV. Thus, an alterative simple, sensitive and specific N protein-based ELISA has been investigated in many laboratories (Liu et al. 2004; Timani et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2004). All these investigations suggest that the N protein is immunodominant and is a perfect diagnostic antigen. For this purpose, we developed a simple way to express and purify the SARS-CoV N protein, by fusion with human GST protein. When the purified hGST-N protein was used as a coated antigen in the ELISA assay for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV infection, it showed a high level of sensitivity (100% positive for the eight tested SARS patients) and specificity (100% negative for the 30 tested healthy people). Also, the ELISA signal was even better than that of the commercial kit (Fig. 3b). As the hGST-N protein can be purified in a single step and the fused human GST is believed not to generate antibodies in human sera, it thus provides a significant option for use in the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV infection.",

Since SARS-CoV infection is through the mucosal membrane,oral or intranasal vaccination might improve the protection efficiency. Thus, two strategies for mucosal vaccination of the N protein have been investigated in our work. One is using the purified hGST-N as the vaccine antigen and the other is using N-expression L. lactis as a live vaccine. For the first one, since hGST is safe for human beings, hGST-N should be acceptable for human vaccination. However, the efficient dosage of hGST-N and the means of administration remain to be investigated. For the second one, since L. lactis is a food-grade LAB and is also acid- and bile-resistant, it might be a good choice as a vehicle for N protein oral vaccination. It was revealed that oral administration of recombinant L. lactis MG1363/pSECN induces significant N-specific antibodies (Fig. 5) and is much more efficient than the oral or intranasal administration of the purified hGST-N, implying that L. lactis is a suitable vehicle for the delivery of N protein to intestinal mucosal sites. Thus, expression of SARS-Cov antigens in L. lactis might provide a novel vaccine. Of course, the immunogenicity of the MG1363/pSECN vaccine is still low. Its CTL response and protective function, including its use as an adjuvant antigen of the SARS-Cov S protein-based mucosal vaccines, remain to be investigated.",

We also constructed a few recombinant L. lactis that expressed the N protein. Oral administration of N-producing L. lactis MG1363 induced N-specific antibodies in mouse sera. These results provide a novel strategy and crucial information for producing the SARS-CoV N protein as a diagnostic antigen and as a mucosal vaccine.",
