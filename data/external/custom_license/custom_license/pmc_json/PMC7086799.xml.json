            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an economically important enteric coronavirus that causes acute viral enteritis [7]. TGEV infection causes vomiting, severe diarrhea, and dehydration, and the disease caused by this virus is the most severe in neonates, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets [8\u201310]. Previous reports have shown that TGEV infection in vitro and in vivo induces the production of a significant amount of IFNs including type I IFNs [11\u201313]. TGEV primarily infects intestinal epithelia in vivo, although infection of dendritic cells and macrophages by TGEV has also been observed [14, 15]. Most of the previous studies focused primarily on the capacity of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) to control TGEV infection. The ability of type II IFN-\u03b3 to inhibit TGEV infection has not been well explored, although many non-lymphoid cells, including epithelia, express IFN-\u03b3 receptors (IFNGR) [16]. The heterodimeric IFNGR complex is made up of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, is highly expressed on myeloid cells and lymphoid cells, and is also widely present in most types of cells, including intestinal epithelia [16, 17]. It is well established that the presence of antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3+ T cells is correlated with protection against rotaviruses, which, like TGEV, primarily infects intestinal epithelia and cause acute diarrhea [18]. IFN-\u03b3 is the only cytokine identified in stimulated CD4+ T cell supernatants to inhibit rotavirus infection directly [19]. While studies of rotavirus infection have indicated that IFN-\u03b3 plays a crucial role in curtailing enteric viral infection, the importance of IFN-\u03b3 in protection against TGEV infection has not been established.",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3, similar to type I IFNs, stimulates the expression of a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) directly and exerts antiviral activity [20, 21]. However, many studies have demonstrated that the signaling cascades initiated by IFN-\u03b3 and type I IFNs are not identical, although there is a degree of overlap between them [22]. Previous studies have also shown that the mechanism by which IFN-\u03b3 exerts its antiviral activity can vary according to the target cell type [23]. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 inhibited TGEV infection directly in both ST cells and intestinal epithelial cells and, when combined with IFN-\u03b1 synergistically suppresses TGEV infection. We also show that porcine IRF1 plays a critical role in IFN-\u03b3-induced signaling and mediates the inhibition of TGEV by IFN-\u03b3. Given the important role of IFN-\u03b3 in modulating T cell immunity in addition to its direct antiviral activity, the potential of IFN-\u03b3 as an effective therapeutic agent against enteric coronavirus infection may have been underestimated.",

To evaluate whether porcine IFN-\u03b3 directly inhibits TGEV infection, ST cells were pretreated with different concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 and then infected with TGEV. IFN-\u03b3 priming significantly reduced both the amount of TGEV genomic RNA and the viral titer when quantified by RT-qPCR and virus titration, respectively (Fig. 1a and b). The suppression of TGEV by IFN-\u03b3 was dose dependent, and we found that the amount of TGEV genomic RNA was reduced more than 50-fold at the concentrations of 1000 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL by RT-qPCR. The dose-dependent inhibition of TGEV infection by IFN-\u03b3 was confirmed by Western blotting of the TGEV N protein (Fig. 1c). To verify that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits TGEV infection directly in ST cells, ST cells were infected with a recombinant TGEV with a green fluorescent protein (TGEV-GFP) marker. IFN-\u03b3 almost completely suppressed TGEV-GFP infection at a concentration of 1000 ng/mL, substantially reduced TGEV-GFP infection even at 1 ng/mL, and displayed dose dependence (Fig. 1d).

TGEV infected Vero E6 cells less efficiently than ST cells. Similar to our findings in ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells, IFN-\u03b3 pretreatment significantly decreased the amount of TGEV genomic RNA present, even at 1 ng/mL, and displayed a dose-dependent effect compared with the untreated control, indicating that the direct anti-TGEV activity of IFN-\u03b3 does not require the response of type I IFNs (Fig. 2a). To exclude the possibility that the TGEV inhibition by IFN-\u03b3 is dependent on type III IFN, we performed the inhibition experiment in Vero E6 cells with an IFNLR knockout, making these cells defective for both type I and type III IFNS. We found that IFN-\u03b3 still inhibited TGEV infection in the IFNLR knockout Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2b).

            "text": "Next, we investigated the mechanism of the anti-TGEV effect of IFN-\u03b3. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 1 is a crucial regulator of IFN-\u03b3 and ISGs [27]. It is constitutively expressed in most cell types, and its transcription is induced by IFN-\u03b3 [28]. Moreover, IRF1 is essential for protection of the host against certain classes of viruses [29]. We hypothesized that porcine IRF1 (poIRF1) plays a critical role in IFN-\u03b3-mediated inhibition of TGEV infection in ST cells. Initially, we assessed whether IFN-\u03b3 induces poIRF1 expression in ST cells. The levels of poIRF1 mRNA significantly increased following IFN-\u03b3 stimulation and displayed a dose-dependent response to IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 3a). The induction of poIRF1 by IFN-\u03b3 was verified by Western blotting of poIRF1 (Fig. 3b). Additionally, the expression of poIRF1 also increased after IFN-\u03b3 treatment followed by TGEV infection in a manner similar to that observed after IFN-\u03b3 treatment alone in ST cells (Fig. 3c). To determine whether poIRF1 is involved in the direct inhibition of TGEV by IFN-\u03b3, we initially evaluated the role of poIRF1 in IFN-\u03b3-induced signaling. The production of CXCL9 and CXCL10 is specifically activated by IFN-\u03b3 in different cell types [30]. To determine whether poIRF1 plays an important role in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated induction of CXCL9 and CXCL10, we silenced endogenous poIRF1 expression by using specific shRNAs. ST cells were transfected with poIRF1 shRNA or a non-targeting shRNA (shNC), and the efficiency of poIRF1 knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3d). shIRF1#1 and #2 led to a 45% and 65% decrease in poIRF1 expression, respectively, when compared with shNC (Fig. 3d). The overexpression of poIRF1 in ST cells was verified by IFA (Fig. 3f). We next examined the mRNA levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 under conditions of poIRF1 knockdown (Fig. 3e) or overexpression (Fig. 3g) in ST cells following IFN-\u03b3 stimulation. IFN-\u03b3 substantially upregulated the expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in ST cells, and the knockdown of endogenous poIRF1 substantially impaired the IFN-\u03b3-elicited production of CXCL9 and CXCL10 (Fig. 3e), suggesting that poIRF1 plays a crucial role in the induction of CXCL9 and CXCL10 by IFN-\u03b3. Consistent with the results of poIRF1 silencing, the overexpression of poIRF1 significantly increased the expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3g). These data show that poIRF1 plays a vital role in IFN-\u03b3-elicited signaling.",

By quantifying TGEV genomic RNA (Fig. 4a) and measuring viral titers (Fig. 4b), we found that IFN-\u03b3 significantly inhibited TGEV infection, whereas silencing of endogenous IRF1 by shIRF1 s completely abolished IFN-\u03b3 inhibition of TGEV infection, indicating that the direct anti-TGEV activity of IFN-\u03b3 is mainly mediated through the poIRF1 signaling pathway. We demonstrated above that IFN-\u03b3 treatment substantially increased poIRF1 expression (Fig. 3a and b). To test whether the IFN-\u03b3-mediated TGEV inhibition occurs through the induction of poIRF1, the inhibition of TGEV by poIRF1 itself was evaluated. Knockdown of endogenous poIRF1 by shIRF1#1 and shIRF#2 resulted in more than a tenfold increase in the amount of TGEV genomic RNA (Fig. 4c) and up to a 15-fold elevation of TGEV titers in ST cells (Fig. 4d), indicating that poIRF1 itself is a potent host restrictor of TGEV infection. We next monitored the effect of poIRF1 overexpression on TGEV infection. As expected, poIRF1 overexpression substantially decreased infection by wild-type TGEV (Fig. 4e and f) and reduced TGEV-GFP fluorescence in ST cells, and the reduction of TGEV-GFP fluorescence was related to the expression levels of poIRF1 (Fig. 4g). These data thus indicate that poIRF1 plays a crucial role in protection of the host against TGEV. Collectively, the data show that inhibition by IFN-\u03b3 of TGEV infection is mediated primarily through the induction of poIRF1.",

We also measured the expression of IFN receptors in intestinal tissues and found that all three interferon receptors were expressed. The expression level of IFNLR was higher than that of IFNAR and IFNGR (Fig. 5b). We also examined the expression of IRF1 after TGEV infection in intestinal tissue and found that IRF1 was upregulated after TGEV infection (Fig. 5c). Activated leukocytes are major sources of IFN-\u03b3 in vivo [31]. We further investigated whether TGEV can directly stimulate porcine PBMCs to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and express IRF1. The results showed that PBMCs exposed to TGEV significantly increased the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IRF1 (Fig. 5d and e). The results suggest that IFN-\u03b3 could play an important role in controlling TGEV infection in vivo.",

To more accurately mimic the in vivo situation, we measured TGEV inhibition after pretreating ST cells with the combination of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b1 alone at a concentration of 200 ng/mL resulted in 10.8-fold or 3.9-fold inhibition of TGEV replication, respectively, when compared to a mock control without IFN treatment. The combination of 100 ng/mL IFN-\u03b3 and 100 ng/mL IFN-\u03b1 inhibited TGEV infection by 126-fold and caused more than 95% inhibition of TGEV (Fig. 6a and b), suggesting that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibit TGEV replication. The synergistic antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 was confirmed by measuring TGEV N protein levels in TGEV-infected cells by IFA (Fig. 6c and d). These results indicate that IFN-\u03b3 enhances the anti-TGEV activity of IFN-\u03b1 and displays a synergistic effect with IFN-\u03b1.",

The development of effective anti-TGEV therapeutics is still very necessary. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03b3 treatment directly inhibits the infection of ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells by TGEV. Moreover, in addition to the direct antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b3 enhances the anti-TGEV activity of IFN-\u03b1 and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with IFN-\u03b1.

            "text": "Just as our published results and those of others have indicated that type I IFNs suppress TGEV in vitro [12, 32], IFN-\u03b3 was found to inhibit enteric coronavirus TGEV in ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells in vitro. Previous studies have demonstrated that TGEV infection induces a significant amount of type I IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in vitro and in vivo [12, 13, 25]. However, we found that IFN-\u03b3 inhibited TGEV less efficiently in Vero E6 cells or IFNLR knockout Vero E6 cells than in ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 2), indicating that the type I IFN and type III IFN response may enhance the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3. Unlike type I IFNs, TGEV infection did not induce the production of IFN-\u03b3 by ST cells or IPEC-J2 cells (data not shown), which is consistent with the fact that IFN-\u03b3 is mainly secreted by immune cells. However, we also showed that TGEV infection induces the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in infected small intestines and PBMCs (Fig. 5). IFN-\u03b3 exerts its direct anti-TGEV activity through a paracrine mechanism by which IFN-\u03b3 from immune cells act on TGEV-infected cells in vivo. The co-existence of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in the local microenvironment of TGEV-infected intestine (Fig. 5a) raises the interesting question of how this affects their anti-TGEV activity. We demonstrated substantial synergy in the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1 against TGEV infection. The combination of 100 ng/mL IFN-\u03b3 and 100 ng/mL IFN-\u03b1 caused a 126-fold inhibition of TGEV infection, which was more than tenfold higher than that of IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b1 alone (Fig. 6). This is in agreement with previous studies with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) showing that the combination of type I IFNs and IFN-\u03b3 synergistically inhibits viral infection both in vitro and in vivo [6, 33]. In line with the synergetic effect of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1, we observed reduced anti-TGEV activity of IFN-\u03b3 in Vero E6 cells, which do not undergo a type I IFN response, compared with ST or IPEC-J2 cells, which are competent for type I IFN production (Fig. 2). This implies that IFN-\u03b3 can play at least a dual role, with a direct anti-TGEV effect and a booster effect for type I IFN antiviral activity in vivo. Given the fact that TGEV infection of ST cells also induces the production of type III IFN, which suppresses TGEV infection (Fig. 5), it will be worthwhile to investigate whether the synergistic effect observed with the combination of type I IFN and type II IFN will also occur with the combination of type II IFN and type III IFN.",

The specific mechanisms of the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3 are not completely clear. IRF1 is the first identified member of the IRF family of transcription factors and is an important regulator of IFN-\u03b3 and ISGs [28]. Consistent with this, we observed that IFN-\u03b3 potently elicited expression of poIRF1 in ST cells (Fig. 3a-c), which mediated the induction of the IFN-\u03b3 target genes CXCL9 and CXCL10 (Fig. 3e and g), indicating that IRF1 is an important modulator of IFN-\u03b3 signaling. In line with this, the knockdown of poIRF1 almost completely abolished the direct antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4a and b), indicating that poIRF1 plays a key role in the direct antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3 against TGEV. This is consistent with studies of dengue virus and murine norovirus showing that the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b3 is dependent on IRF1 [27, 34]. IRF1 is a potent host viral restrictor and restricts replication of certain classes of viruses including West Nile virus [35], HCV [36], and vesicular stomatitis virus [37]. In line with a previous study [38], the overexpression of poIRF1 substantially inhibited TGEV infection (up to 287-fold) in ST cells, even in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 treatment (Fig. 4e-g), whereas silencing of poIRF1 resulted in a moderate increase of TGEV infection (Fig. 4c and 4d), suggesting that poIRF1 is an important cellular inhibitor of TGEV infection.",
