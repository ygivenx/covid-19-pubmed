He reported the rat to the veterinary services department of the Colorado State University Laboratory Animal Resources program for an examination. The rat was singly housed in static micro-isolator caging with a 12-h:12-h light:dark cycle and had ad libitum access to water and rodent chow (Harlan Teklad 8640, Madison, WI). Serologic evaluation of two dirty-bedding sentinel rats caged in the same room gave negative results for serum antibodies of common rat pathogens (rat coronavirus, parvovirus, Kilham's rat virus, rat theilovirus, Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Mycoplasma pulmonis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and reovirus type 3).",

The rat was in good body condition and showed no evidence of trauma on its body; palpation of the mass did not appear to cause any pain. The mass did not impede walking or seem to trouble the rat. We found no other abnormalities during our clinical examination.",

Blood and serum were processed and analyzed within 2 h at the Colorado State University School of Veterinary Medicine Clinical Pathology laboratory. The samples were evaluated using an automated hematology analyzer (Bayer Advia 120, Bayer Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Chemistry samples were evaluated using a Hitachi 917 automated analyzer (Roche Inc., Basel, Switzerland). Both instruments are validated to analyze clinical samples from Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematology and biochemistry results were within normal ranges1,2. Microscopic examination of blood smears showed rare lymphocytes with azurophilic granules, rare giant platelets, few acanthocytes, few keratocytes, moderate echinocytosis and slight polychromasia.",

After staining the smear with Wright-Giemsa stain, we observed low to mild cellularity of a homogenous mononuclear cell population against a background laden with erythrocytes, platelet clumps and scattered leukocytes (Fig. 2a). The mononuclear cells were moderately sized and contained one moderately sized, round to oval nucleus that was uniform in appearance. These cells possessed a stippled nuclear chromatin pattern; rare binucleated cells were observed (Fig. 2b). We saw moderate amounts of moderately basophilic, often vacuolated cytoplasm; anisokaryosis was minimal and anisocytosis was mild. A few rare cells possessed a high degree of anisokaryosis, having multiple, variably sized nuclei. The background contained moderate numbers of free, ruptured nuclei and amorphous, basophilic cellular debris. There were no cytological signs of infection or inflammation.",
