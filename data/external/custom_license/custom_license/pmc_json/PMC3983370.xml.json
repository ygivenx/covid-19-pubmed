Additionally, the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of the\nSer 64 backbone form hydrogen bonds with the ribose 2\u2032-hydroxyl\nsubstituents and N7 of the base with distances of 3.0 and 2.7 \u00c5,\nrespectively. Tyr 124 is located on the surface of the N protein in\nthe HCoV-OC43 N-NTD and is directly involved in the interactions with\nthe AMP base through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking. The phenolic\nhydroxyl group substituent on Tyr 126 forms hydrogen bonds with the\nsixth amino groups present in the AMP adenine ring with a distance\nof 3.1 \u00c5. Hydrogen bonds also form between the 2\u2032-hydroxyl\ngroup of the AMP ribose and the Arg 164 side chain. The Arg 122, Tyr\n124, Tyr 126, and Arg 164 side chains generate a distinct ribonucleotide-binding\npocket and interact with the ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate\nvia hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking\nforces (Figure 2C). These amino acids are sequentially\nand structurally conserved in other HCoV N proteins (Figure S2, Supporting Information); therefore, they are\nlikely essential for RNA recognition and interaction in all coronavirus\nN proteins. In addition, the structure of the N-NTD in the AMP co-complex\nis essentially identical to the previously published structure of\napo HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value\nof 0.19 \u00c5 (123 equivalent C\u03b1 atoms) (Figure 2D). Only the phenyl group of F57 is displaced backward by\n1 \u00c5 to prevent steric hindrance at the AMP entrance. We solved\nthe structures of three additional HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes (cytosine\nmonophosphate (CMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and uridine monophosphate\n(UMP)), all featured protein\u2013RNA interactions similar to the\ninteraction of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\u2013AMP complex. See Figure\nS3 in the Supporting Information. A comparison\nof the amino acid composition of ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate-binding\nsites in the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complexes (Figure S3D) shows that amino\nacid residues Ser 64, Phe 66, Gly 68, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and\nArg 164 are interactive in more than two HCoV-OC43 N-NTD complex structures,\nindicating their importance in RNA binding. Compared to AMP, the higher B-factors of CMP, GMP, and UMP indicate the ligand for CMP,\nGMP, and UMP is quite flexible in the ribonucleotide-binding pocket\nof HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Table 1; Table S1, Supporting Information). On the basis of the\nelectron density maps of similar resolution data, it appeared that\nthe structure of the AMP complex showed better defined electron density\nfor all components of the nucleotide (Figure 2A). These results suggest that this pocket is probably specific for\nAMP. More studies are needed to prove this in the future.",

Potential hits with high\ndocking scores (87 compounds) (Table S2, Supporting\nInformation) were further analyzed on the basis of these docking\nresults. We found that nine of the potential hits showed interaction\ncharacteristics reminiscent of those between AMP and HCoV-OC43 N-NTD\n(Table S3, Supporting Information). First,\nthey all contain an aromatic core able to stack onto Y124 of the N-NTD.\nSecond, the aromatic core contains hydrogen-bond-forming moieties\nto mediate the specific interactions with the N-NTD. Third, the aromatic\ncore contains an attached branching moiety (or moieties) to fit into\nthe ribonucleotide-binding pocket. More importantly, among the 87\npotential hits, these 9 compounds were readily available commercially.\nWe further studied the effects of the nine compounds on the RNA-binding\ncapacity of N protein by SPR experiments. Two compounds, O3 and PJ34,\ndecreased the RNA-binding capacity of N protein by more than 10% (Table\nS3). Because PJ34 and O3 were predicted to bind to the N-NTD ribonucleotide-binding\npocket, we next studied PJ34 and O3 in virus replication assays. To\nenhance virus replication, we transfected N cDNA into cells prior\nto infection because previous results showed that increased N protein\nexpression enhanced replication.20 In general,\na 10 \u03bcM concentration of each candidate compound was used in\nsubsequent assays. If the candidate compound at this concentration\nwas effective, we considered the compound worthy of continued development.\nWe monitored M mRNA levels in infected 293T cells in the presence\nof PJ34 and O3 at 10 \u03bcM both with and without exogenous N protein\nexpression. Because the M gene is transcribed throughout the HCoV-OC43\ninfection, M mRNA levels should reflect viral replication. As predicted\nfrom previous studies, M mRNA levels were increased 7-fold in infected\ncells transfected with plasmid that encodes the WT N protein compared\nto those that did not receive transfected N cDNA (2.41 and 0.32 in\nthe presence and absence of N protein expression, respectively) (Figure 3A,B). In the PJ34-treated cells, M mRNA levels were\n0.65 and 0.11 in the presence and absence of N protein expression,\nrespectively, while in the O3-treated cells, corresponding M mRNA\nlevels were 2.46 and 0.22. Thus, M mRNA levels were reduced both in\nthe presence and in the absence of N protein expression after treatment\nwith PJ34 at 10 \u03bcM (Figure 3A,B), whereas\nO3 treatment was not effective. PJ34 has been shown to have therapeutic\nefficacy in several noninfectious conditions. In one instance, PJ34\ntreatment reduced central nervous system inflammation and maintained\nneurovascular integrity in mice during the onset of experimental allergic\nencephalomyelitis.32 This compound also\nexhibited neuroprotective effects in both in vivo and in vitro stroke\nmodels.33 To determine whether PJ34 hindered\nthe HCoV-OC43 replication by interfering with the binding of the N\nprotein to RNA, we used SPR to determine the effect of compound PJ34\non the RNA-binding affinity toward HCoV-OC43 N protein. In the presence\nof PJ34 under saturation conditions, RNA affinity for HCoV-OC43 NP\ndecreased with decreasing resonance unit (RU) values for PJ34 (Figure 3C). The HCoV-OC43 N protein exhibited weaker RNA\nbinding in the presence of PJ34 with a 5-fold increase in the dissociation\nconstant (Figure 3D). Therefore, PJ34 antagonizes\nthe binding activity between HCoV-OC43 N protein and RNA. Consequently,\nthe data indicate that PJ34 interacts with the HCoV-OC43 N protein,\ndecreasing RNA binding and subsequently decreasing viral replication.",

Previous X-ray analysis revealed that the folding\nof the N protein\u2019s N-terminal domain is essentially conserved\nacross various CoV strains20,24,26,34 with a right-handed fist-shaped\nstructure in which the palm and finger are rich in basic residues,\nwhile the flexible loops remain ordered around the \u03b2-sheet core\nof the NTD, possibly providing a scaffold for RNA binding. X-ray diffraction\nanalyses of RNA-binding proteins complexed with ribonucleoside monophosphate\nhave been used in several studies to identify the unique ribonucleotide-binding\nsite in the RNA-binding domain.35,36 Here, we report an\nN-NTD\u2013ribonucleoside 5\u2032-monophosphate complex crystal\nstructure that comprises a pocket for accommodation of ribonucleotide\nbinding. On the basis of the structures of the N-NTD\u2013ribonucleotide\ncomplex, two tyrosine residues on HCoV-OC43 NTD (Tyr 124 and Tyr 126)\nwere found to interact with RNA bases via stacking and hydrogen-bonding\ninteractions, respectively. Similar interactions were observed in\ncomplexes between vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein and RNA.37 In addition, two arginine residues of HCoV-OC43\nNTD, Arg 122 and Arg 164, interact with the phosphate group and ribose\nthough ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, respectively. These\nfour residues were conserved in other HCoVs as well, and the results\nsuggest that the ribonucleotide-binding pocket of the HCoV N-NTD exists\namong different CoVs (Figure S6, Supporting Information). No structural data are available regarding CoV N protein binding\nto single-stranded RNA. To understand the structural interactions\nresponsible for the RNA recognition by HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, we modeled\nthe structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD in an RNA-bound state using the crystal\nstructure of the N-NTD\u2013AMP complex as a template (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Previous studies indicated\nthat the positively charged amino acid, Arg 106, located at the cleft\nin the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD structure, is conserved in all CoV N proteins\nand interacts nonspecifically with the RNA phosphate backbone.20 This model indicates that the RNA-binding region\nof the N-NTD contains Arg 106, Arg 122, Tyr 124, Tyr 126, and Arg\n164 and expands from the \u03b2-sheet core to the exterior loop region.\nA previous study showed that other conserved positively charged residues\nin the positively charged loop of HCoV-OC43 N protein, including R107,\nK110, and R117, were also involved in RNA binding.20",

            "text": "Current antiviral drugs developed to treat CoV infections\nprimarily\ntarget the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases.38 However, antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically\nact on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity\nand severe side effects. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are\nneeded to combat acute respiratory infections caused by CoV. The CoV\nnucleocapsid protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that\nis necessary for viral RNA transcription and replication. Recent studies\nsuggest that N proteins in infections caused by coronaviruses and\nother viruses will be useful antiviral drug targets because they serve\nmany critical functions during the viral life cycle. Two strategies\nto inhibit oligomeric N protein function have been reported.39 The first strategy is to impair normal N protein\nfunction by interfering with monomer\u2013oligomer equilibrium through\neither enhancement or inhibition of its oligomerization. The second\none is to target the RNA-binding site, which contains a number of\nconserved residues. In one study, nuclozin analogues were shown to\ninhibit influenza A virus replication by preventing RNP formation\nduring viral particle production.40 Lo\net al. identified an antiviral peptide that interferes with the CTD\noligomerization of the HCoV N protein and inhibits HCoV.19 The results presented herein provide a detailed,\nhigh-resolution picture of the ribonucleotide monophosphate bound\nto the CoV N-NTD and identify a unique ribonucleotide-binding pocket\nin the center of the CoV N-NTD. Mutation of RNA-binding residues in\nthe NTD of the coronaviral N protein led to a significant decrease\nin its RNA-binding affinity and subsequent decrease in viral replication.\nTherefore, the N-terminal RNA-binding domain of coronaviral N protein\nwould be a validated target for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs through\ninterference with the RNA-binding activity of the N protein. Compounds\nbinding to this site that act as competitive N protein inhibitors\nmay be employed to combat highly pathogenic CoVs. PJ34 has been reported\nto protect mice against brain ischemia, splanchnic ischemia, reperfusion,\nand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxicity, in addition to various models\nof local inflammation.41 We also found\nthat the cell viability was not affected by treatment with PJ34 alone\nup to 20 \u03bcM for 24 h in cell lines. Therefore, the efficacy\nof PJ34 is relatively diverse while its safety is high, making PJ34\nan ideal new candidate for antiviral therapy. We found that PJ34 at\n10 \u03bcM inhibits coronavirus replication and potently interferes\nwith the RNA-binding activity of HCoV OC43 N protein by targeting\nthe N-NTD ribonucleotide-binding pocket. On the other hand, O3 did\nnot abolish HCoV-OC43 viral replication, likely because O3 is closer\nto the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD disordered loop than is AMP, which hinders\nany orientation suitable for the formation of a hydrogen bond network\nwith the \u03b21 strand, based on the docking results. Moreover,\nsince O3 is as a potent inhibitor of CDC25 protein phosphatases,42,43 most likely some O3 molecules will bind CDC25 and consequently lose\nthe ability to inhibit HCoV-OC43 N-NTD interactions. On the basis\nof the mechanisms of action of compounds such as AMP and PJ34 and\nthe chemical features common to these two distinct compound classes,\nwe formulated three general guidelines for developing CoV N-NTD-targeting\nagents: First, a polycyclic aromatic core is required to enable \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\nstacking with the tyrosine residues in the N-NTD. Second, introducing\nhydrogen-bond-forming moieties to the aromatic core mediates specific\ninteractions with the N-NTD. Third, attaching a branching moiety (or\nmoieties) that fits the ribonucleotide-binding pocket can enhance\nthe drug affinity and specificity (Figure 6).",

After 600 s, the surface was recovered\nby washing with 10 \u03bcL of 0.1% SDS for each single-stranded RNA.\nThe sensorgrams revealing interactions between the RNA and protein\nwere analyzed using BIA evaluation software (version 3) to determine\nthe dissociation constants (kd/ka). To analyze the effect of PJ34 on the interactions\nbetween the N proteins and RNA, the N proteins were used with PJ34\nin 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% CHAPS injected onto\nthe sensor chip.",
