According to one estimate, ferrets probably make up less than 10% of the animals in this category2. Though less common than other laboratory animal species, ferrets have many uses in biomedical research. Some facilities use ferrets to teach pediatric endotracheal intubation techniques because the airway of the ferret resembles the human pediatric airway in size and anatomy3. Ferrets are also an important model for the study of human and avian influenza virus transmission4,5,6,7,8 and for the development of vaccines against these viruses9,10,11,12,13,14. They are especially useful for studying the synergism of influenza infection and bacterial colonization that occurs in pediatric patients15. Additionally, because ferrets are susceptible to infection by the coronavirus that led to the SARS outbreak in 2003 (ref. 16), they may prove to be a useful model for this disease17. Ferrets are naturally colonized with Helicobacter mustelae and can present with gastric ulcers, thus providing a model for the attachment and colonization of human Helicobacter pylori18 and its role in gastric ulcer formation. The ferret is also a model for human metabolism of carotenoids, which are natural plant pigments19.",

The report states that carbon dioxide is an acceptable method of euthanasia in mink, but indicates that the gas must be administered in high concentrations because mink are burrowing animals and have physiological mechanisms to cope with carbon dioxide exposure. One study showed that mink were able to survive for longer than 15 min when exposed to carbon dioxide at a concentration of 70% mixed with 30% atmospheric air21.

Distress resulting from prefilling has not been evaluated in ferrets, and it is not known how prefilling compares with gradual-fill methods for the euthanasia of this species. Additionally, for gradual-fill euthanasia, species-specific guidelines regarding carbon dioxide displacement rates and their effects on the ferret are needed.

In humans, within minutes of exposure to almost any physical or neurogenic stressor, the adrenal glands secrete cortisol in response to stimulation by the adrenocorticotropic hormone, often increasing its secretion as much as 20 times24. Cortisol then stimulates gluconeogenesis by the liver and decreases cellular use of glucose. The overall effect after a stressful event is a rise in both serum cortisol and blood glucose concentrations. In animals such as the cat, hyperglycemia is a well-documented, rapid, physiological response to stress25,26. A previous study of wild ferrets measured glucose concentrations to compare the stress induced by capture using leg-hold traps with that using cage traps27. It is unknown whether the domestic ferret experiences a rise in blood glucose in response to stress.",

The final purpose was to determine, with the help of blinded observers using a visual analog scale, which of the chosen displacement rates was subjectively the least distressful to the ferrets.

One ferret was born in our facility under an approved protocol. We group-housed ferrets in enclosures with a total volume of 53 ft3. We maintained them on a light:dark cycle of 12 h:12 h in a temperature-controlled room (64\u201384 \u00b0F).

Based on our facility's current practices, general anesthesia followed by intravenous or intracardiac injection of barbiturates should be encouraged as the preferred method of euthanasia in the ferret.
