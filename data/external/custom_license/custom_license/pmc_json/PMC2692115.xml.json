This airflow obstruction is associated with an inflammatory process in the bronchial mucosa. Most patients are current or ex-smokers. Many patients have one or more exacerbations per year, which are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and decreased quality of life (NHLBI 2006). Exacerbations are responsible for over half of the direct disease-related costs of care. Viral infections including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and many other viruses are important causes of exacerbations, excess morbidity and mortality in COPD (Wedzicha 2004; Wilkinson et al 2006). During seasonal outbreaks of viral infections, patients with COPD are at risk for respiratory illness-related hospitalizations, irrespective of age or disease severity (Gorse et al 2006). Prevention and early treatment of exacerbations are therefore believed to be an important target in the management of COPD. Inhaled steroids may reduce the number and the severity of exacerbations in patients with severe airflow obstruction and frequent exacerbations, but the effects are limited (Burge et al 2000; Jones 2004). Inhaled bronchodilators may have similar effects. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended in most COPD guidelines and neuraminidase inhibitors are available for the treatment of influenza.",

            "text": "The influenza virus belongs to the orthomyxovirus group. The influenza virus is a spherical or filamentous enveloped virus. Virus strains are characterized by different hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subclasses. Hemagglutinin, a surface glycopeptide, aids attachment of the virus at specific receptor sites on the walls of susceptible host cells and facilitates entry of viruses into the cell. The enzyme neuraminidase facilitates cell penetration by pinocytosis and stimulates the release of viruses from the host cell by budding through the cell membrane (Matrosovich et al 2004). The virus exists in two main forms: A and B. Influenza A is generally responsible for epidemics and pandemics. Influenza B causes milder, generally more localized and less severe outbreaks, eg, in schools or in camps. A lesser known C form rarely causes disease in humans. 15 H subtypes (H1\u2013H15) and nine N subtypes (N1\u2013N9) have been identified for influenza A viruses. New antigenic variants of influenza A develop at irregular intervals through the process of antigenic shift, whereas point mutations in influenza A and B viruses result in changes in amino acids in the H and the N glycoproteins responsible for humoral immunity, resulting in antigenic drift (Zambon 1999). These changes render the individual\u2019s immune response less able to combat new variants. As a result, major shifts in antigenic profiles of the viruses can cause epidemics. The immune system is less blunted by the minor antigenic drifts that cause less severe outbreaks (Stamboulian et al 2000). In 1957 the appearance of influenza A2 type H2\u2013N2 was associated with over 20 million deaths. The worldwide pandemic that occurred in 1968 was the result of the emergence in Hong Kong of influenza H3\u2013N2. Minor antigenic drifts have since then caused smaller outbreaks in various areas of the world. Avian flu, caused by H5\u2013N1, has emerged in 1997 and re-emerged in 2004\u20132005 and represents a major change in viral surface antigens, and transmission to humans has been shown to be a serious threat (Beigel et al 2005).",

In most cases influenza is an acute febrile respiratory disease that occurs in annual outbreaks of varying severity. The incubation period of influenza is 1 to 3 days. Influenza typically causes extensive destruction of airway epithelial cells (Hers 1966). Symptoms start abruptly and consist of fever, shivering, and diffuse pains in the extremities. Many patients present with early, prominent systemic symptoms and have headache, soreness of the throat, and dry cough that can persist for several weeks (Monto et al 2000). Mortality can be high in the elderly especially in patients with chronic respiratory or cardiac diseases. Recovery can take up to 3 months and secondary bacterial infections are common, particularly with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Staphylococcus aureus superinfections can cause pneumonia that has a mortality of up to 20% (Brundage 2006).",

Other processes believed to be of importance are an imbalance of proteinases and antiproteinases and oxidative stress. Many cells and mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation in COPD. With time this inflammation can result in structural changes in the bronchial wall and destruction of lung parenchyma or emphysema, and consequently in irreversible airflow obstruction and gas exchange abnormalities. Host factors are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of the characteristic inflammation in COPD, as are viruses (Proud and Chung-Wai 2006). Also, host behavior in response to viruses and possible aberrant antiviral host responses may influence the persistence of inflammation following exposure to viruses. In stable COPD latent respiratory viruses, such as RSV or adenoviruses have been associated with accelerated lung function decline, independent of smoking status, exacerbation frequency, and lower airway bacterial load (Mallia and Johnston 2006). RSV may also be associated with systemic inflammation. Whether other viruses, such as different influenza strains, have similar effects in stable COPD is at present unknown. It has been shown that respiratory viruses, such as RSV and also influenza viruses, enter into the bronchial epithelial cells where they can replicate and result in epithelial cell destruction and necrosis. This results in increased permeability of the mucosa, which allows other pathogens and irritants to penetrate, leads to neurogenic inflammation by substance P and bradykinin, M2- and \u03b22-receptor dysfunction, and contributes to bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Wilkinson et al 2006). Airway hyperresponsiveness causes excessive airway narrowing in COPD patients.",

Between 15% and up to 64% of COPD exacerbations have been found to be associated with symptomatic colds precipitated by viruses (Seemungal et al 2001; Wedzicha 2004). Of these, rhinovirus and enteroviruses, both belonging to the picornavirus group of RNA viruses, stand out. Coronavirus, adenovirus, RSV, Influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses have been linked with COPD exacerbations and often multiple viruses can be detected (Rohde et al 2003). Various mechanisms are believed to be involved in the way viruses induce or aggravate exacerbations. Rhinoviruses attach to airway epithelium cells through intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and thereby cause inflammatory cell recruitment and activation. Also, viral infections were found to be associated with increased oxidant stress, the activation of nuclear factor \u03baB, and the expression of stress-response genes (Wedzicha 2004).",

Unfortunately, significant variation within the major virus types causing disease limits the success of vaccination programmes. Since influenza viruses display antigenic shift and drift, new vaccines must be developed at regular intervals. In response to the arrival of new pandemic strains, new vaccines must be made available in sufficient quantities. The effectiveness of the vaccines, usually inactivated virus vaccines containing 3 virus strains (2 type A and 1 type B) depends on the similarity between the strains in the vaccine and the virus strains likely to circulate in the upcoming winter. Protection occurs through circulating antibodies to H and N or stimulation of cytotoxic T-cell responses. Protection by influenza vaccination is only effective in 70% of patients and only lasts for one year (WHO 2005). New vaccines must be prepared each year to cover the expected change in antigenicity. As a consequence, by definition supplies are limited in case of an emerging epidemic. Obviously, the benefit of vaccination is largest in epidemic years when the vaccine strain is similar to the epidemic strain.",

Also, they have several toxic side-effects that further reduce their usefulness (Jefferson et al 2006). N-inhibitors are effective against all N-subtypes and therefore, other than amantadines, they can be used against all strains of influenza. They act by preventing the release of virions from infected host cells. Generally it is recommended not to use N-inhibitors routinely for seasonal influenza and use these drugs only with associated public-health measures in a pandemic situation (Moscona 2005).

The literature regarding the effects of N-inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults has recently been reviewed by Jefferson and colleagues (2006). This excellent review summarizes the result of 52 randomized controlled trials testing N-inhibitors in controlled clinical prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment trials. They conclude that oseltamivir in a daily oral dose of 75 mg and of inhaled zanamivir 10 mg daily have no effect in prophylaxis of influenza-like illness compared with placebo. Whether higher doses are more effective is uncertain. The efficacy of oseltamivir compared with placebo, orally administered in a dose of 75 mg daily, against symptomatic influenza is 61%. In a dose of 150 mg daily, the efficacy is 73% (Jefferson et al 2006).",
