For 12 samples positive for both assays, 90% and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC90 and IC50) pseudotype neutralizing titers were compared with titers obtained at HPA by neutralization assay using replication-competent SARS-CoV. Logarithmic plots of pseudotype versus live virus neutralization titers are shown in Figure 2. Correlation coefficients for pseudotype IC90 and IC50 titers versus live SARS-CoV neutralization titers were 0.69 and 0.78, respectively. MLV(SARS) entry into QT6/ACE2 cells was not substantially inhibited by sera from healthy persons or from persons with human coronavirus OC43 and 229E antibodies. MLV(VSV) infection was not inhibited by any sera (data not shown). The pseudotype assay was thus shown to be both sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, with no evidence for cross-reaction with the other human coronaviruses. Although the live virus assay was based on the Frankfurt SARS-CoV isolate, and the pseudotype assay was based on the Urbani isolate, they gave equivalent titers, including analysis of serum from the person from whom the Frankfurt isolate was made.",

Since the neutralization titers measured on replication-competent SARS-CoV and pseudotypes are highly correlated, this assay can be widely applied in routine diagnostics and used for the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines and immune therapies for SARS, without the pathogen itself being handled. This advantage is important because nosocomial infections have arisen from laboratory handling of SARS-CoV in Taiwan, Singapore, and Beijing (37). A lack of good, quantitative assays for SARS-CoV replication in vitro also makes the pseudotype assay, with its easily interchangeable reporter genes, a more flexible platform with which to study neutralization and cell tropism.",

When looking for neutralizing antibody responses, previous researchers have predominantly tested samples taken during the convalescent phase of the disease, whereas we found that during the period 8\u201314 days after onset of fever, 9 patients in our cohort had neutralizing responses to SARS S protein. Viral load, as measured by real-time RT-PCR, for 19 of the patients in our cohort, was previously shown to peak at approximately day 4 or 5 after onset of fever and then decreased to barely detectable around the time of seroconversion (38), which suggests that the neutralizing antibody response may play a role in viral clearance. This finding has implications for diagnostics and surveillance, since positive diagnoses for neutralizing antibodies can be made earlier in infection and as a complement to testing for IgG responses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SARS has yet to manifest itself as a seasonal epidemic threat like influenza, which makes mass vaccination an unlikely scenario. The rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies seen in this study suggests that localized vaccination with an effective vaccine is likely to help control the spread of SARS-CoV during an outbreak, if vaccine elicits as rapid a response as live virus.",

In a second patient, IC90 neutralizing antibody titers attained 640 by day 22 after onset of fever, followed by a decline; however, in another patient, neutralizing antibody was detectable at day 261 after onset of fever.

We have shown that some patients convalescing from SARS have similar responses before full recovery, which suggests that this level of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies may be protective. Initial preclinical studies in mice and hamsters are encouraging and show that neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to protect against live virus challenge (16\u201319,40). Candidate vaccines for SARS must be moved from the preclinical evaluation phase to clinical trials in human volunteers as rapidly as possible, since the possibility of further SARS outbreaks is uncertain. The method used here to analyze natural infection can be applied to clinical trials of candidate vaccines, and we expect this test to be equally applicable to animal sera.",

Murine leukemia virus (MLV) or HIV pseudotypes bearing either the pantropic vesicular stomatitis virus envelope protein (VSV-G) as a positive control, or the SARS-CoV S, were added to target cells. After 72 h, green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013positive cells were counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Infection titers are given as infectious units per milliliter (IU/mL).
