For example,\nthe use of intravascular catheters, which enables direct vascular\naccess, is crucial for patient diagnosis and treatment. However, despite\nsubstantial efforts to better understand blood/surface interactions,\ncomplications like pulmonary embolism, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis\nare still associated with the use of indwelling blood-contacting medical\ndevices.2 In a clinical setting, a systemic\nanticoagulation agent, such as heparin, is often given to patients\nin order to reduce the risk of surface-induced thrombus formation.3 However, heparin treatment should be conducted\nwith extreme care, as an inadvertent overdose of heparin can lead\nto hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia.4 Although\nheparin preferentially binds to antithrombin (ATIII), preventing fibrin\nformation and hindering the development of the hemostatic plug, platelet\nactivation and reduced platelet count is inevitable when foreign surfaces\nare in contact with blood for a prolonged period. Moreover, biofilm-associated\ninfections are a significant cause of morbidity and death. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the\nmost prevalent cause of the high incidence of nosocomial bloodstream\ninfections, specifically, biofilm-associated infections on indwelled\nbiomedical devices.5,6S. aureus biofilms\nform embedded matrixes which resist both antimicrobials and host defense,\nthus leading to chronic infections.7 Therefore,\nnew approaches to reduce the possibilities of these complications\nand to create truly nonthrombogenic and antimicrobial prosthetic surfaces\nare still needed within the medical community.2",

Ten\nwt % SNAP-doped CarboSil films with no topcoat, 2 layers of CarboSil\ntopcoat, and 2 layers of SR topcoat were soaked in 1 mL of PBS at\n37 \u00b0C. Although SNAP can absorb light in the UV range (see Figure\nS1 in the Supporting Information),37,42 it is not practical to quantify its decomposition species (e.g.,\nNAP and NAP disulfide) by UV\u2013Vis.37,46 Therefore, the concentrations of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide in\nPBS solution buffers at each time point were monitored by LC\u2013MS.\nStandard solutions of NAP, NAP disulfide, and SNAP (1, 5, 10, 20,\n40, and 60 \u03bcM) were prepared and analyzed for the individual\nelution times and concentration\u2013peak area calibration curves\n(see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

The log P values were calculated using Marvin Sketch software, where\na higher value means greater lipophilicity and hence a longer retention\ntime. Ten wt % SNAP films initially contain ca. 450 nmol of SNAP per\nmg of polymer. When SNAP films are in contact with the soaking solutions,\nwater starts to diffuse into the polymer outer surface; SNAP begins\nto leach into the soaking buffer; and at the same time, SNAP (both\nfrom the PBS buffer and within the polymer) starts to release NO and\nform the NAP disulfide byproduct. The detection of NAP thiolate ion\nin the soaking solutions can be from two possible sources. It is known\nthat, for solid RSNO samples, contamination of thiols is likely and\nsuch thiols can react with the trace amount of Cu(II) in solution\nand form Cu(I) (eq 2).\nThen, Cu(I), acting as a catalyst, can react with RSNOs (e.g., SNAP),\nand form RS\u2013 (e.g., NAP thiolate) and Cu(II) (eq 3).47,48 Alternatively, it is conceivable that small amounts of thiolate\ncan be generated by hydrolysis of RSNOs (eq 4).48234",

A large burst\nof NO release was observed by the NOA (via chemiluminescence) on day\n0 that correlates with the rapid SNAP leaching into the PBS buffer\nin the first few hours. The cumulative amount of SNAP that releases\nNO was calculated based on the NOA measurements and compared to the\ninitial amount doped within the film. The total NO release from polymer\nfilms can originate from the SNAP decomposing and releasing NO inside\nthe polymer phase as well as from SNAP molecules that diffuse out\nof the polymer into the PBS buffer. Assuming that the NAP and NAP\ndisulfide detected in the buffer are reaction products of the original\nSNAP leached from the polymer, the total amount of SNAP that leaches\nout after time t should be [SNAP]total = [SNAP]t + [NAP]t + 2 \u00d7 [NAP disulfide]t. Since\nthe films were placed into fresh PBS during NOA measurements, the\nNO release detected by the NOA can be only attributed to the SNAP\ndecomposing and releasing NO from inside the polymer phase ([NO]NOA) (assuming the amount of SNAP leaching during the measurement\nwas negligible). Therefore, the total NO release ([NO]total) from the polymer film is [NO]total = [NO]NOA + [SNAP]total, which was compared with the initial SNAP\nin the CarboSil film. As shown in Figure 3b, the total moles of SNAP ([SNAP]total) leached out over 22 days, the time period of the leaching experiment,\nis approximately 38.5% of the total NO released ([NO]total) and, therefore, more than 60% of the total NO is, in fact, released\nfrom the polymer phase. This suggests that the leaching process is\nmuch slower than the rate of NO release from the polymers, so it is\nlikely that, after the first day, NO release from within the polymer\n(primarily in the water-rich regions near the outer surfaces of the\npolymers) is the primary source of NO emission. The ability of the SNAP/CarboSil\npolymer system to deliver localized NO continuously and sufficiently\nto sites of interest makes it a very promising material for biomedical\napplications.",

It has been suggested that, in orthorhombic SNAP, one SNAP molecule\ncan form 4 intermolecular hydrogen bonds with 4 surrounding SNAP molecules\n(Figure S6).55 The PXRD results of SNAP-doped CarboSil films (1\u201315 wt %)\nindicate that the characteristic film diffraction patterns are convolutions\nof blank Carbosil and the crystalline SNAP powder patterns (see Figure 4). The results also\nsuggest that, as the amount of doped SNAP increases (for films with\ngreater than 4 wt % SNAP), the intensity of orthorhombic SNAP peaks\nin the obtained PXRD pattern is enhanced, indicating a greater percentage\nof crystalline SNAP within the polymer films. However, SNAP peaks\ncould barely be detected in PXRD patterns for samples with <4 wt\n% doped SNAP, indicating an apparent threshold for formation of the\ncrystalline form of SNAP within CarboSil. Since all SNAP-doped CarboSil\nfilms (including those with <4 wt %) have a light green color,\nit is speculated that SNAP partially dissolves in the polymer, forming\na polymer solution, and any excess SNAP beyond the polymer solubility\nlimit crystallizes in the orthorhombic form during the THF evaporation\nand embeds in the polymer. This explanation is in agreement with the\nRaman spectroscopy and PXRD results that orthorhombic SNAP crystals\nare detected only when the SNAP concentration exceeds the solubility\nof SNAP in the CarboSil polymer. To calculate the SNAP solubility\nin the CarboSil polymer, a linear least-squares regression was conducted\n(see the Supporting Information) using\nthree main PXRD peaks.

We hypothesize\nthat the solubilized SNAP behaves as a solute, dissolving in the CarboSil\npolymer that acts as the solvent, and it is less stable at room temperature\nand decomposes faster than the crystalline SNAP. As the solubilized\nSNAP in the polymer decomposes and the SNAP in the polymer is under\nsaturation, the crystalline SNAP is driven to gradually dissolve into\nthe CarboSil polymer.

One SNAP/CarboSil and one control catheter (non-SNAP) were placed\ninto the external jugular veins of each rabbit for 7 h. Owing to the\nvery slow loss of SNAP from the catheter reservoir (given the composite\nnature of the material), the dose of SNAP leached from the catheters\nis significantly below the threshold that can induce the adverse reactions.10",

As shown in Figure 7, the thrombus formation is significantly reduced for the SNAP/CarboSil\ncatheters with NO release ability when compared to the controls (n = 3 rabbit experiments).

The 10 wt % SNAP/CarboSil has excellent stability during\nthe 8 month shelf life study at 37 \u00b0C as well as during ethylene\noxide sterilization, where 88.5% and 91.8% of the initial SNAP remain\nin the polymer, respectively. These data suggest the practicality\nof sterilizing, storing, and shipping biomedical devices made with\nor coated with this material. Raman spectroscopy and PXRD characterization\nof SNAP-doped CarboSil films demonstrate that the solubility of SNAP\nin CarboSil is ca. 3.4\u20134.0 wt %. However, when the SNAP doping\nwt % is higher than this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic\ncrystal form within the bulk of the polymer, in which intermolecular\nhydrogen bonds between SNAP molecules play a key role in maintaining\nthe RSNO stability and functionality over a long period of time. Solubilized\nSNAP in the polymer phase behaves like a solute in the solid solution\npolymer system and is less stable and decomposes faster than the crystalline\nSNAP. When the solubilized SNAP in polymer decomposes/releases NO\nand the SNAP within the polymer phase is under saturation, the crystalline\nSNAP in the bulk of the polymer is driven to gradually dissolve into\nthe polymer and further release NO. The NO release process ceases\nafter 22 days when all the SNAP crystals are depleted. The catheters\nfabricated with this SNAP composite are shown to exhibit significant\nantibiofilm properties against S. aureus, and such\ncatheters could eventually be used to reduce the rate of nosocomial\ncatheter related bloodstream infections. The SNAP/CarboSil catheters\nalso greatly reduce thrombus formation during 7 h implantation within\nthe veins of rabbits when compared to the corresponding control catheters.\nGiven its excellent stability and long-term NO release capability,\nthe new SNAP-doped CarboSil composite system offers many new opportunities\nto improve the biocompatibility of biomedical devices for many applications.",
