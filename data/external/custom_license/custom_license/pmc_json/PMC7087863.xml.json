This multifactorial syndrome is characterized by progressive depletion of skeletal muscle, which is often, but not always, accompanied by loss of body fat (Fearon et al. 2011). Cachexia-induced muscle wasting and weight loss have a detrimental effect on the patient\u2019s quality of life and are the major factors contributing to death (Fearon 2008). However, there are few therapeutic options available for cancer cachexia, and conventional nutritional support cannot fully reverse these cachectic manifestations (Fearon et al. 2011). Thus, it is important to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms to develop novel treatment strategies and improve the current therapeutics for cancer cachexia.",

            "text": "Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia by mediating systemic inflammation, which in turn promotes the degradation of muscle proteins (Saini et al. 2006). In response to proinflammatory cytokines, NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor regulating the expression of a number of proinflammatory markers such as cytokines and chemokines, is activated, thus establishing a positive feedback loop that results in overstimulation of NF-\u03baB, fibrosis and degradation of specific muscle proteins (Kumar et al. 2004; Li et al. 2008). Muscle protein degradation is mediated by the lysosomal system, cytosolic protease and ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway. Among these mechanisms, the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway plays a predominant role and accounts for the majority of skeletal muscle degradation in cancer cachexia (Melstrom et al. 2007). The key enzyme in the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system is E3 ubiquitin ligase. Two E3 ligases, atrogin-1 (MAFbx) and muscle RING finger protein 1(MuRF1), are involved in skeletal muscle atrophy (Gomes et al. 2001; Bodine et al. 2001). Accumulating data have demonstrated that both MAFbx and MuRF1 are regulated by NF-\u03baB (Judge et al. 2007; Cai et al. 2004; Adams et al. 2008).",

MG132 is a specific, potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor and blocks the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated I\u03baB, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation (Inoue et al. 2009). It was recently shown that MG132 could reduce immobilization-/disuse-induced skeletal muscle atrophy via inhibiting NF-\u03baB (Caron et al. 2011; Jamart et al. 2011). In the present study, we evaluated the potential effect of MG132 in cancer cachexia and found that MG132 ameliorated cancer cachexia by attenuating the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

To evaluate the effect of MG132, we administered MG132 to the tumor-bearing mice at various stages of cachexia and analyzed changes in body weight. Although there was no apparent difference 5 days postimplantation in terms of body weights, significant difference was noted between mice from the MP and CC groups or the MP and MT groups, starting from day 12 (P < 0.5). After 19 days, significant weight loss was observed in mice from CC, MP and MT groups (P < 0.5). Moreover, a drastic difference in terms of the carcass weights after excision of tumor burden was noted between MP and CC groups (P < 0.001). Interestingly, only slight but not significant difference in body weights were observed between these two groups (1a). Other than body weight, tumor weights and volumes were also recorded for all tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 1b\u2013d, tumor volumes and weights of MP mice were 54.41 and 48.96 % of those of CC mice, respectively. When administrated during advanced cachexia from day 12, MG132 was less effective in alleviating weight loss and inhibiting tumor growth (P < 0.001), while the body weights of mice from the MT group remained 17.40 % heavier than those of CC mice. In addition, tumor volumes and weights of the MT group were 48.96 and 61.25 % of those of CC mice, respectively (Fig. 1b\u2013d). Besides weight loss, anorexia is another characteristic symptom of cancer cachexia. Consistent with a previous study, no significant differences in food intake were observed between groups (Tanaka et al. 1990) (data not shown). These results demonstrated that MG132 ameliorated weight loss and inhibited tumor growth of C26 tumor\u2013bearing mice.\n",

In response to MG132 treatment, significant increases in spontaneous physical activity were observed in the MP and MT groups. Furthermore, MG132 treatment beginning at day 5 was more effective in restoring spontaneous physical activity of tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2c). We next recorded survival time of tumor-bearing mice and plotted the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves. The survival time for mice from the MP and MT groups was 9 and 5 days longer than those of CC mice, respectively. However, it seemed that survival time was not correlated with the timing of the first dose of MG132 during the course of cachexia (Fig. 2d).

As shown in Fig. 3a\u2013d, CC mice showed significantly reduced levels of glucose, albumin and total protein compared with HC mice. Interestingly, elevated levels of triglyceride were observed in CC mice (Fig. 3b). Administration of MG132 restored serum glucose, albumin and total protein levels and reduced the triglyceride level. In addition, administration of MG132 during the early stages of cachexia is more effective in restoring carbohydrate metabolism (Fig. 3 a\u2013d).

To examine whether MG132 exerts its anti-cachexia functions by attenuating the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, we performed ELISA to measure TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in serum and gastrocnemius muscles from tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 4a\u2013d, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in both serum and gastrocnemius tissues were significantly higher in CC mice as compared to HC mice, while the serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 in MT and MP mice were 49.19 and 20.87 % lower than those of CC mice, respectively. Similarly, IL-6 levels in the serum of MT or MP mice were 51.85 or 41.89 % lower than those of CC mice, respectively (Fig. 4a\u2013b). In gastrocnemius muscles from MP or MT mice, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels were also significantly reduced, and the effect was more prominent when MG132 was administered during the early stages of cachexia (Fig. 4c\u2013d). Therefore, MG132 suppresses the upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the serum and gastrocnemius muscles of tumor-bearing mice.\n",

            "text": "Our data demonstrated that elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels are accompanied by progression of cancer cachexia. Expression of these cytokines is regulated by NF-\u03baB. In turn, these cytokines serve as potent activators of NF-\u03baB, whose activation plays a critical role in skeletal muscle atrophy (Li et al. 2008; Guttridge et al. 2000). The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway is involved in the degradation of regulatory and structural muscle proteins, such as myofibrillar proteins. Increased activation of NF-\u03baB leads to skeletal muscle atrophy by enhancing the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome proteolytic pathway (Cai et al. 2004; Cao et al. 2005). Recent data showed that MG132 reduces skeletal muscle atrophy by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation (Caron et al. 2011; Jamart et al. 2011). These data led us to hypothesize that MG132 ameliorates cachexia by preventing skeletal muscle atrophy through regulation of NF-\u03baB-mediated ubiquitin\u2013proteasome proteolysis. We examined the expression of I\u03baB\u03b1, p65, MuRF1 and MAFbx in the gastrocnemius muscles of tumor-bearing mice using real-time PCR and western immunoblot. Dramatic reductions in mRNA of I\u03baB\u03b1 were observed in CC mice as compared to those of the HC group (Fig. 5a), while mRNA levels of p65, MAFbx and MuRF1 were significantly increased in tumor-bearing CC mice (Fig. 5b\u2013d). MG132 elevated the mRNA of I\u03baB\u03b1, at the same time attenuating mRNA levels of p65, MAFbx and MuRF1. Moreover, these effects were more evident in mice receiving the first dose of MG132 during the early course of cachexia (Fig. 5a\u2013d). Similar protein patterns were also observed (Fig. 6a\u2013d). These results demonstrated that MG132 inhibits NF-\u03baB-mediated ubiquitin\u2013proteasome proteolysis in cachectic animals, particularly during the early stages of cancer cachexia.\n\n",

            "text": "As a highly debilitating characteristic of many cancers, cachexia complicates cancer treatment, diminishes the quality of life and reduces the life span of patients with advanced malignancy (Dodson et al. 2011). Though a number of pharmacotherapeutic agents with various mechanisms of action are currently being evaluated, there are currently no drugs approved for the prevention and treatment of cancer cachexia. Regarding its critical roles in muscle atrophy, targeting NF-\u03baB pathway is a promising strategy. A study with curcumin demonstrated that inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling resulted in muscle regeneration in mice (Thaloor et al. 1999). Direct targeting of NF-\u03baB DNA binding sites by intratumoral injection of oligonucleotides inhibited cachexia in a mouse model (Kawamura et al. 1999). Moreover, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, the principal polyphenolic component in green tea, was shown to regulate NF-\u03baB and attenuate skeletal muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia (Wang et al. 2011). It is known that proteasome inhibitors could block the activation of NF-\u03baB through stabilization of the phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1. Therefore, we speculated that proteasome inhibitors might ameliorate cancer cachexia by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway. To test this hypothesis, we established a cancer cachexia mouse model that was treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, at various time points during cachexia. We found that MG132 could effectively reverse skeletal muscle atrophy and inhibit tumor growth, accompanied by downregulation of the NF-\u03baB/ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway.",

            "text": "MG132 is a potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor whose clinical implications have been studied extensively. For instance, MG132 together with the immunosuppressant, celastrol, improved sialidosis (O\u2019Leary and Igdoura 2012). In severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), MG132 effectively inhibited the replication of SARS coronavirus (Schneider et al. 2012). Moreover, MG132 was shown to alleviate liver injury induced by intestinal ischemia in rats (Jing et al. 2012) and was able to suppress cytomegalovirus-specific immune responses (Wang et al. 2011). Recently, the therapeutic potential of MG132 for cancer treatment has been evaluated. Regardless of cancer type, MG132 is a promising anti-cancer agent functioning by inhibiting tumor cell growth and inducing cancer cell apoptosis (Guo 2012; Sung et al. 2012; Zanotto-Filho et al. 2012; Lombardo et al. 2012). In the present study, we showed that skeletal muscle atrophy induced by cachexia was significantly reversed with MG132 treatment. Our results are consistent with previous studies which showed that MG132 prevented muscle dystrophy (Winder et al. 2011), disuse-induced atrophy (Caron et al. 2011) and immobilization-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy (Jamart et al. 2011). By ameliorating skeletal muscle atrophy and reducing tumor burden, MG132 treatment led to reduced weight loss, improved spontaneous activity and longer survival time in tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that MG132 is a potential therapeutic agent for cancer cachexia treatment. Moreover, administration of MG132 during the early stages of cancer cachexia was more effective in alleviating cachectic manifestations, supporting the observation that preventative interventions in the management of cancer cachexia are important (Fearon et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, play critical roles in regulating muscle mass and protein degradation during cachexia (Carson and Baltgalvis 2010; Pajak et al. 2008). We observed in the current study that elevated serum and gastrocnemius muscle levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were correlated with enhanced muscle wasting and weight loss during cachexia, whereas administration of MG132 led to significant reductions in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in serum and gastrocnemius muscle, accompanied by alleviated cancer cachexia manifestations. Previous studies have demonstrated that MG132 could reduce pain and inflammation through inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling (Ahmed et al. 2010). Our data indicated that the anti-cachexia effect of MG132 was also mediated by suppressing the NF-\u03baB pathway. An elevated expression of I\u03baB\u03b1 and reduced levels of p65 in gastrocnemius muscle were observed in mice receiving MG132 treatment. In agreement with a previous study which showed that inhibiting the expression of MuRF1 and MAFbx could reverse skeletal muscle atrophy and muscle protein degradation (Glass 2010), we showed that MG132 significantly reduced MuRF1 and MAFbx. Moreover, western immunoblot with protein extracted from tumor tissue revealed that MG132 could impede tumor growth by targeting NF-\u03baB pathway, like what has been observed in Zanotto-Filho et al.\u2019s study (Zanotto-Filho et al. 2012). However, ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway seems not to contribute to the anti-cancer effect of MG132 as the expression of MAFbx and MuRF1 was not affected. Therefore, MG132 may attenuate cancer cachexia by blocking activation of NF-\u03baB and hence upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, inhibiting the downstream ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathways such as MuRF1 and MAFbx, thereby ameliorating muscle atrophy and muscle protein degradation.",
