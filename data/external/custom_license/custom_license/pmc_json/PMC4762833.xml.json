The West African Ebola outbreak offers a unique opportunity to investigate how communication infrastructure and personal factors affect the ability of frontline health care providers to respond appropriately to global health crises. Our goal was to measure how the risks of Ebola were perceived and acted upon by health professionals, particularly in ambulatory care settings, where preparedness is uniquely challenging.12 In addition, we wanted to explore the role that different information sources and regional context played in shaping provider attitudes and knowledge. To address these aims, we conducted a national survey of U.S. internists, examining self-reported preparedness among physicians and whether their potential for clinical exposure to Ebola was predictive of their management approach in hypothetical clinical scenarios.",

The second section assessed physicians\u2019 perceptions of Ebola risk. The third section asked respondents to rate the personal importance of information sources and their level of preparation in order to identify and manage possible cases. The fourth section measured how physicians assessed the risk of Ebola versus influenza in a series of clinical scenarios, which were written such that influenza was more likely in each case while the probability of Ebola varied. Finally, the survey posed clinical vignettes testing knowledge of appropriate management of suspected Ebola, transmission methods, and incubation period based on CDC guidelines circulating at the time of survey distribution.9 The survey was field-tested by primary care physicians at two adult internal medicine clinics affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital; insights from the field testers\u2019 survey responses and oral comments were incorporated into the final instrument (eSurvey).",

When we looked at management intensity of these responses, we found that the only significantly associated factor was the possibility of encountering Ebola: physicians who practiced outside metropolitan areas associated with Ebola cases or designated airports, or who did not report patients with recent West African travel, were more likely to endorse overly aggressive management. This may be because these physicians were less motivated to stay abreast of Ebola clinical guidelines or due to a lack of institutional or community infrastructure to support the physicians in management\u2014although we found no association between the possibility of encountering Ebola and the presence of an institutional protocol.
