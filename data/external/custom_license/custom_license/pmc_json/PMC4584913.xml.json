These data will be published in more detail next year in the Summary of Notifiable Diseases \u2014 United States, 2013 (1). Because no cases were reported in the United States during 2013, the following diseases do not appear in these early release tables: anthrax; diphtheria; eastern equine encephalitis, nonneuroinvasive disease; poliovirus infection, nonparalytic; severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV); smallpox; St. Louis encephalitis, nonneuroinvasive disease; western equine encephalitis, neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive disease; yellow fever; and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Data on chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infection (past or present) are not included because they are undergoing data quality review. Data for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses do not appear because CDC is transitioning to a new system for processing national HIV surveillance data, and will be published in the Summary of Notifiable Diseases \u2014 United States, 2013.",

The publication criteria used for the 2013 finalized tables are listed in the \u201cPrint Criteria\u201d column of the NNDSS event code list, available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/nndss_event_code_list_2013_revised.pdf. In addition, only cases from reporting jurisdictions where the nationally notifiable disease is reportable are published. The NNDSS website is updated annually to include the latest national surveillance case definitions approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists for classifying and enumerating cases of nationally notifiable infectious diseases.",
