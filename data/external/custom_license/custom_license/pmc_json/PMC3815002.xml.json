            "text": "Acute gastroenteritis (AGE), characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting, continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children mostly in resource-constrained nations. Although generally it is a mild and self-limiting disease, gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and is associated with a substantial disease burden.1,2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual.3 When young children suddenly experience an episode of acute diarrhea, with or without vomiting, infectious gastroenteritis is by far the most common explanation.4 Viewed from a global perspective, gastroenteritis in children is of enormous public health importance. Worldwide, about 10.6 million children still die every year before reaching their fifth birthday. Gastroenteritis alone is responsible for almost 20% of the deaths.4",

Mode of transmission is mainly horizontal, through physical contact with an infected person or with their excretions. The pathogens, most frequently transmitted during the passage through the birth canal, are enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and enterovirus. Although rare, the passage of the germ can also occur transplacentally during bacteremia. Several maternal infections are asymptomatic. Horizontal transmission can occur through direct contact with siblings, parents, or health care workers. Some cases of transmission through the ingestion of contaminated water or infant formula are also reported. Some viral infectious agents, such as adenovirus and rotavirus, can be transmitted by air.12",

In the newborn, the protective role of gastric motility and of the intestinal mucus is still uncertain. Other external factors contribute to the balance of the intestinal ecosystem: nutrition, type of delivery, hygiene habits, use of antibiotics in the mother and infant and the supplementation with probiotics and/or prebiotic oligosaccharides in the newborn.15\u201317 The mortality risk for very low-birth-weight infants (less than 1500 g) due to acute diarrhea is 100 times higher than for infants of low or appropriate birth weight (more than 1500 g). Acute diarrhea has several risks and complications; it may lead to life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. When diarrhea is not halted there is a risk of disturbed digestion and absorption of nutrients with nutritional deterioration.13 Prevention is essential, and all health professionals should ensure caregiver education in the following main principles of prevention:13",

Some C. jejuni isolates elaborate very low levels of cytotoxins, similar to Shiga toxin. Some isolates have been reported to elaborate an enterotoxin similar to cholera toxin. Enterotoxin production has been more frequently observed in isolates from resource-constrained nations, where infection by C. jejuni has been associated with watery diarrhea. However, the clinical significance of the toxigenicity of these organisms is still unclear.23 Symptoms and signs of C. enteritis are not distinctive enough to differentiate it from illness caused by many other enteric pathogens. Diarrhea is often associated with blood, but it can be difficult to distinguish from other invasive forms. A cholera-like illness with massive watery diarrhea may also occur. Bacteremia is uncommon (less than 1%) in immunocompetent patients with C. jejuni infection.22 Newborn infection by Campylobacter spp is rare; most cases were born to mothers with Campylobacter diarrhea at the time of delivery.

Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serotypes are one of the main causes of food-borne diseases.33 Serotypes number about 50, and in rich countries are primarily responsible for gastroenteritis with bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, and cramps that resolve in a few days with an adequate oral rehydration.",

Another study reported increased diarrhea episodes among Peruvian infants with recent H. pylori seroconversion.47 Conversely, in a Thai orphanage, no association was found between seroconversion and diarrheal disease.48 Some investigators have even speculated that local inflammatory factors induced by infection may be protective.49 In a cross-sectional study of elementary school-age children in Germany, the infection seemed associated with a reduced frequency of diarrheal illnesses.50 These epidemiological discrepancies could be explained, because H. pylori could be argued to increase or decrease susceptibility to enteric pathogens. Depending on the age at acquisition and the anatomical site of colonization, for example, H. pylori decreases gastric acid secretion in some people, thereby potentially reducing the effectiveness of the gastric acid barrier to intestinal pathogens, but increases gastric acid secretion in others.51 In this prospective study, H. pylori did not seem to increase the risk of gastroenteritis in people more than 2 years old.43 These data have recently been confirmed.52",

A new coronavirus was found to be a causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-HCoV caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection with high mortality. Diarrhea is common in this condition, and in one study was registered in 38.4% of patients. In the same study, SARS-HCoV was also isolated from intestinal tissue, and viral RNA was detected in stool samples. Moreover, non-SARS HCoVs can be found in stool samples of children with AGE. However, most of the HCoV findings were coinfections with well-known enteric pathogens \u2013 norovirus and rotavirus. It is also difficult to determine whether HCoVs in the respiratory tract in cases of AGE were primarily causing the respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. HCoVs may also be found in occasional stool samples of children without gastroenteritis. These findings suggest that known HCoVs may at most have a minor etiologic role in AGE of children.70",

Many infected persons can be asymptomatic, leading to difficulties in the eradication and control of this parasite due to the number of potential carriers, such as school children. Giardia lamblia is observed almost three times more in asymptomatic children than in symptomatic children. The first signs of acute giardiasis include nausea, loss of appetite and an upper gastro-intestinal uneasiness, followed or accompanied by a sudden onset of explosive, watery, foul-smelling diarrhea. Stools associated with Giardia infection are generally described as loose, bulky, frothy and/or greasy with the absence of blood or mucus, which may help distinguish giardiasis from other acute diarrheas. Other gastro-intestinal disturbances may include: flatulence, bloating, anorexia, cramps. The acute stage usually resolves spontaneously in a few days. Occasionally an acute infection will persist and lead to malabsorption, steatorrhea, loss of strength and weight loss. It has been estimated that about 200 million people are infected each year in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In the resource-rich countries the prevalence rate of giardiasis is 2\u20135%. However, in resorce-constrained countries, Giardia lamblia infects children early in life thus a prevalence rate of 15\u201320% in children younger than 10 years is common.

Many infants and children experience brief episodes of diarrhea, and are managed by their parents without seeking professional advice. Even if advice is sought, health care professionals often consider that a clinical assessment is all that is required, and laboratory investigations are not undertaken.4 However, there may be particular circumstances when investigations may be helpful in diagnosis. Frequently the signs and symptoms are not sufficient to make an etiological diagnosis as they often are nonspecific. The localization of the pathogen in the small intestine or in the colon, the characteristics of the feces (Table 2), the clinical history of the disease, and environmental risk factors can support the diagnostic evaluation.

Human milk also has antiviral action through the lactoferrin and products of digestion of lactoferrin and milk fatty acids.112 All of these elements suggest that exclusive breastfeeding contributes to protection against common infections during infancy and lessens the frequency and severity of infectious episodes.113 Breastfeeding promotes the colonization of the intestinal ecosystem with a predominance of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (probiotics) rather than coliforms, enterococci, and bacteroides that characterize the intestinal microflora of infants fed with formula.114 Some authors have demonstrated that the use of formulas supplemented with probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus GG) have decreased the incidence (up to 57%) and severity of diarrhea. The probiotics, also defined as food supplements, improve intestinal balance, have beneficial effects on health, and are able to balance the intestinal ecosystem and reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal infections, especially in the course of rotavirus infections. The probiotics in the intestine determine resistance to colonization by other potentially pathogenic microbes through mechanisms of competition or inhibition, and the effects are expressed both on nonspecific innate and acquired immunity.115Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is considered particularly effective in the management of AGE; this is confirmed by a recent Cochrane review documenting that LGG reduced the duration of diarrhea, mean stool frequency on day 2, and the risk of diarrhea lasting \u22654 days.1,116",

            "text": "According to a recent Cochrane review, Saccharomyces boulardii reduces the risk of diarrhea lasting \u22654 days, and a more recent review confirmed that S. boulardii significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization. A recent randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of treatment with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 compared with placebo: the administration of L. reuteri reduced the duration of watery diarrhea, the risk of diarrhea on days 2 and 3, and the relapse rate of diarrhea.1 It has been suggested that probiotics may decrease infant mortality and nosocomial infections because of their ability to suppress colonization and translocation of bacterial pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. Several meta-analyses evaluating probiotics in preterm infants suggest a beneficial effect for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis and death, but less for nosocomial infection. L. reuteri may reduce these outcomes because of its immunomodulation and bactericidal properties. A large, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) using L. reuteri was performed to test this hypothesis in preterm infants. This study suggested that although L. reuteri did not appear to decrease the rate of death or nosocomial infection, the trends suggest a protective role consistent with what has been observed in the literature: a protective role for mortality, nosocomial infection, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Feeding intolerance and duration of hospitalization were significantly decreased in premature infants less than 1500 g.117 The use of formulas supplemented with probiotics (particularly Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus GG) seems to decrease the incidence (up to 57%) and severity of infectious acute diarrhea. Symbiotics, a combination of prebiotics and probiotics that beneficially affect the host by improving survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the gastrointestinal tract, has recently been evaluated by two European RCTs for the management of AGE. These studies are promising, but presently it would not be appropriate to recommend the use of symbiotics until confirmatory data are available.1",

            "text": "All moderate and severe patients require close monitoring, but patients at the extreme ages of life, especially children under 18 months, require meticulous observation and immediate measures if their condition worsens. According to current WHO recommendations, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is considered the treatment of choice to replace fluid and electrolyte losses caused by diarrhea in children with mild to moderate dehydration. Intravenous rehydration is the treatment of choice in cases of failure of ORT, and it has to be reserved for patients with severe dehydration or who eliminate more than 10\u201320 mL/kg/hour. In the 1960s, efforts by young scientists and researchers led to the development of ORT for the treatment of dehydration that often accompanies acute attacks of diarrhea. Many members of the research team responsible for this discovery were associated with noteworthy universities and medical research centers in the US. The goal of their research was to devise effective therapies for cholera-induced diarrhea; as a result of their hard work, they developed a new framework for treatment that would soon be adopted throughout the developing world as a key element in the overall strategy to combat acute diarrhea and the potentially fatal dehydration that accompanies the disease. In an article published in 1968 in the Lancet, it was confirmed that cholera patients could be rehydrated orally with a simple solution of water, salt, and sugar, and equally importantly that field staff could easily be trained to administer the therapy. As stated in the article, ORT also offers a practical treatment for large numbers of patients in the developing world who do not have access to traditional intravenous drip therapy. At first, studies on the efficacy of ORT, when compared with intravenous therapy (IVT), were conducted only in patients with cholera.120\u2013122 Following that, other studies established the effectiveness of ORT in children with acute diarrhea from other causes.123 Some trials also compared the effectiveness of oral rehydration with IVT in children with different degrees and types of dehydration (mild, moderate, severe, and hypernatremic dehydration), and they concluded that the use of ORS to rehydrate children is safe and that there are no significant differences in incidences of hyponatremia, hypernatremia, mean duration of diarrhea, weight gain, or total fluid intake if compared with IVT. In terms of outcomes, ORT was associated with a higher risk of rehydration failure, while babies treated with IVT had a significantly longer stay in hospital and a higher risk of phlebitis, but no statistically significant differences were seen.124 The main reason for this failure is that ORS neither reduces the frequency of bowel movements and fluid loss nor shortens the duration of illness; moreover, the unpalatability of regular ORS (strong salty taste) also decreases this acceptance. However, the most important aspect of treatment of gastroenteritis is the water and electrolyte balance. It must be adjusted according to serum electrolytes, body water content (greater the younger the child), and the water demand must be calculated on the weight of the newborn infant (Table 5A and B). Different ORS are now commercially available (Table 6).125 Recently, some companies have added probiotics to the saline solution to obtain a quick balance of intestinal bacterial flora. The infant should be monitored closely to check the status of nutrition and hydration. Infants with moderate dehydration, suspected infected by EHEC, with bloody diarrhea, or systemic symptoms should be hospitalized. These newborns are at high risk of secondary complications. During ORT, milk-feeding is often temporarily suspended. Among all the oral solutions, the ideal one has a low osmolarity (210\u2013250 mOsm/L) and a sodium content of 50\u201360 mmol/L to avoid high levels of serum sodium. The solution should be administered frequently and in small amounts to prevent vomiting. Initial oral rehydration is 50\u2013100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours.126 Also consider giving the ORS via a nasogastric tube if patients are unable to drink it or if they vomit persistently and to monitor them by regular clinical assessment. In cases of failure of oral rehydration, it is necessary to establish an appropriate parenteral rehydration fluid and electrolyte solutions (Table 7).127",

            "text": "Pediatric presentations of racecadotril were first authorized in France in 1999, and today it is approved and widely used in seven European countries (France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania) and outside Europe.128 This antisecretory drug is a peripherally acting enkephalinase inhibitor that reduces intestinal water and electrolyte hypersecretion acting on the enkephalins (neurotransmitters of the gastrointestinal tract) through the selective stimulation of delta receptors inhibit adenylate cyclase activity by reducing the intracellular concentration of cAMP, thus reducing the secretion of water and electrolyte in the intestinal lumen. The result is a reduction of water and electrolyte secretion without changes in intestinal motility. Moreover, the action of racecadotril takes place only when there is a hypersecretion and has no effect on the activity secretory baseline. New data have reconfirmed that racecadotril is an effective adjunctive therapy to oral rehydration in watery diarrhea.1 A recent individual patient data meta-analysis129 assessed the efficacy of the use of racecadotril as an adjunct to ORS compared with ORS alone or with placebo. Raw data from nine RCTs involving 1348 children aged 1 month to 15 years with AGE were available for the analysis. Two trials compared the effect of racecadotril with placebo130,131 with no treatment (two RCTs), or with kaolin-pectin (two RCTs). Compared with placebo, racecadotril significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea after inclusion. Almost two times more patients recovered at any time in the racecadotril group vs the placebo group (P < 0.001). There were no interactions between treatment and dehydration, rotavirus infection, type of study (outpatient/inpatient), or country. In the studies evaluating inpatients, the ratio of mean stool output racecadotril/placebo was reduced (P < 0.001). In outpatient studies, the number of diarrheal stools was lower in the racecadotril group (P < 0.001). In the responder analysis (defined as a duration of diarrhea of less than 2 days), the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the racecadotril group compared with the placebo group. By adjusting for dehydration and rotavirus, the absolute risk difference was 24.7% (95% confidence interval 19.8\u201329.7), and the associated number needed to treat was four. The secondary need for care in outpatients was significantly in favor of racecadotril in two studies. Also, the need for IVT was lower in the racecadotril group compared with the placebo group. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the groups. The results of this recent meta-analysis support the use of racecadotril as an adjunct to ORS for the management of AGE in children. In addition, the safety of racecadotril in children has been demonstrated in clinical studies, including a large pre- and postaccess study showing that racecadotril has a favorable adverse-event profile in children.128\u2013130 Despite racecadotril\u2019s proven safety and efficacy in treating acute watery diarrhea, its cost-effectiveness for infants and children has not yet been determined in Europe.128 The UK model highlights the potential savings arising from reduction in diarrhea duration and avoidance of reconsultation and referral rates in children with diarrhea.128",

Ondansetron is widely used in the pediatric emergency department for vomiting and AGE; it can help with the successful delivery of ORT, thereby reducing the need to treat with IVT. A recent study evaluated the spectrum of diagnoses for which ondansetron is used in the pediatric emergency room. Medical records of patients 3 months to 18 years of age given ondansetron for 2 years were retrospectively reviewed. Patients without a primary discharge diagnosis of vomiting or gastroenteritis were defined as non-gastroenteritis, and they were compared to the gastroenteritis group. The non-gastroenteritis group includes 38% of the subjects, and they were older (8.3 vs 4.3 years) than the gastroenteritis patients. The most common primary diagnoses for non-gastroenteritis discharged patients were fever (15%), abdominal pain/tenderness (13%), head injury/concussion (7%), pharyngitis (6%), viral infection (6%), migraine variants (5%), and otitis media (5%). Although ondansetron is a widely accepted treatment for gastroenteritis in children \u2013 62% of total use \u2013 this study identifies a broader spectrum of primary diagnoses for which ondansetron is being used.132 Another study used RCTs comparing antiemetics with placebo or no treatment in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years, for vomiting due to gastroenteritis. The proportion of patients with cessation of vomiting in 24 hours was 58% with intravenous ondansetron, 17% placebo, and 33% in the metoclopramide group (P = 0.039). In this case, the authors\u2019 conclusions were that oral ondansetron increased the proportion of patients who had ceased vomiting and reduced the number needing intravenous rehydration and so immediate hospital admissions.1,133 Today, it is still unclear if in spite of an improvement in the vomiting, ondansetron worsens diarrhea. Some trials report a statistically significant increase in its frequency as an adverse event. In Cochrane reviews, diarrhea was reported as a side effect in four of the five ondansetron studies.133\u2013135 According to WHO, of the antiemetics available, those with the greatest evidence of efficacy in the prevention of nausea and vomiting (particularly in the treatment of postsurgery nausea and vomiting) were ondansetron and dexamethasone, ondansetron as first-line treatment with the addition of dexamethasone as required.136",

Probiotics, also defined as food supplements, improve the intestinal microbial balance of the host, have beneficial effects on health, prevent outbreaks of community-acquired diarrhea, reduce colonization of infants with pathogenic microorganisms, and reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal infections, balancing the intestinal ecosystem. In large clinical trials, Lactobacillus reuteri, LGG, and Saccharomyces boulardii have shown the best therapeutic effects (reducing mean duration and frequency of watery diarrhea and number of watery stools per day, and improving stool\u2019s consistency).140\u2013142 Particularly, a recent randomized double blind study carried out in three Italian pediatric centers showed that L. reuteri DSM 17938, taken together with a standard ORS, significantly reduced the duration of watery diarrhea compared with placebo (2.1 \u00b1 1.7 days vs 3.3 \u00b1 2.1 days, P < 0.03). On days two and three of treatment, watery diarrhea persisted in 82% and 74% of the placebo and 55% and 45% of the L. reuteri recipients, respectively (P < 0.01, P < 0.03). Moreover, children receiving L. reuteri DSM 17938 had a significantly lower relapse rate of diarrhea (15% vs 42%, P < 0.03).143 The European Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have suggested the use of probiotic strains with proven efficacy and in appropriate doses for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis as an adjunct to rehydration therapy.144,145 Probiotics and symbiotics are of interest as they elicit health-promoting properties to the host, release various soluble low-molecular-weight molecules of different nature (surface and exogenous proteins, peptides, amines, lectins, sirtuines, nucleases, other enzymes, bacteriocines, fatty and amino acids, lactones, nitric oxide, etc), are able to interact with corresponding cell receptors, to reply quickly by induction of special sets of genes, to support stability of host genome and microbiome, to modulate epigenomic regulation of gene phenotypic expression, and to ensure information exchange in numerous bacterial and bacteria\u2013host systems. All this plays an important role in the control for many physiological, biochemical, and genetic functions in supporting host health. Recently, probiotic L. reuteri strain ATCC PTA 6475 demonstrated the ability to potently suppress human tumor necrosis-factor production by lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes and primary monocyte-derived macrophages from children with Crohn\u2019s disease: the primary mechanism of probiotic-mediated immunomodulation is transcriptional regulation.146 Other researchers have confirmed these results, and it has been shown that L. reuteri produce biologically active small compounds, previously unknown, that can modulate host mucosal immunity. The identification of bacterial bioactive metabolites and their corresponding mechanisms of action with respect to immunomodulation may lead to improved anti-inflammatory strategies for chronic immunomediated diseases.147",

Antibacterial therapy serves as an adjunct, to shorten the clinical course, eradicate causative organisms, reduce transmission, and prevent invasive complications. Selection of antibacterials to use in acute bacterial gastroenteritis is based on clinical diagnosis of the likely pathogen prior to definitive laboratory results. Antibacterial therapy should be restricted to specific bacterial pathogens and disease presentations. In general, infections with Shigella spp and Vibrio cholera should usually be treated with antibacterials, while antibacterials are only used in severe unresponsive infections with Salmonella, Yersinia, Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Plesiomonas spp, and Clostridium difficile. Antibacterials should be avoided in EHEC infection.148 There is no evidence of benefit for antibiotics in nontyphoidal Salmonella diarrhea in otherwise healthy people. The effects in very young people, very old people, and in people with severe and extraintestinal disease are not always so clear, and a slightly higher number of adverse events are noted in people who receive antibiotic treatment for nontyphoidal Salmonella diarrhea.149 However, empiric therapy may be appropriate in the presence of a severe illness with bloody diarrhea and stool leucocytes, and particularly in patients with risk factors (ill-fed or debilitated patients), the use of systemic antibiotics has been recommended (Table 8).148,150 The benefits and risks of adverse drug reactions should be weighed before prescribing antibacterials. Moreover, a major concern is the emergence of antibacterial-resistant strains due to the widespread use of antibacterial agents.",

            "text": "Antibiotic therapy for STEC is complicated. The growth of O157:H7 in the intestinal tract leads to diarrhea, and patients would presumably benefit if antibiotic treatment eliminated the bacteria. However, systemic dissemination of Shiga toxin type 2 produced by the bacteria in the intestinal tract can lead to life-threatening complications, including neurological damage and HUS. Antibiotic treatments that induce the phage lytic cycle, resulting in increased Shiga toxin production, could lead to more serious disease. Recent studies suggest that normal flora can have a profound impact on Shiga toxin production. Subinhibitory levels of antibiotics that target DNA synthesis, including ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, increased Shiga toxin production, while antibiotics that target the cell wall, transcription, or translation did not. So ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim are not appropriate for treatment of O157:H7. In contrast, azithromycin significantly reduced Shiga toxin levels, even when relatively high levels of O157:H7 were recovered.164 Moreover, the eradication rate reported in STEC O104:H4 infections is 86%. Azithromycin might be considered a potentially effective and safe antibiotic, and may be used safely for decolonization of STEC O104:H4 long-term carriage.165 Numerous outbreaks, as well as sporadic cases of STEC infections and HUS, have been documented worldwide. There are numerous reports on STEC O157:H7 as the most common serotype associated with HUS, especially in children. Several reports on non-O157 STEC underline their potential to cause sporadic disease as well as epidemics. During 2011, there was a large outbreak in Northern Germany, with a satellite outbreak in Western France caused by an EAEC of serotype O104:H4 expressing a phage-encoded Shiga toxin 2: clinicians were confronted with a large number of mainly adult patients with HUS associated with severe hemolysis and neurological complications.166 Medical centers used varying therapeutic regimens, including plasmapheresis, glucocorticoids, and the anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab, but currently there is no effective prophylaxis or treatment available for STEC infections and HUS.166 The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) seemed to have very efficient antagonistic activity on the EHEC strains of serotype O104:H4 and O157:H7, with reduced growth of pathogens.167",

These strains combine the virulence mechanisms of two pathotypes (EAEC and EHEC), leading to an improved ability to adhere to and infect host cells. Furthermore, the acquisition of mechanisms mediating increased antibiotic resistance hampered patient treatment and recovery. These strains have conserved most of the virulence factors of an EAEC strain, but several mobile genetic elements were responsible for the acquisition of new functions involved in high-frequency recombination, mobilization, and transfer of genes. Despite the alternative mechanisms that have evolved to colonize and adapt to new niches, E. coli strains have maintained a core genome sequence, and therefore share several components that could be useful targets for a universal vaccine against E. coli. Considering the increasing antibiotic resistance present among E. coli strains, which is derived from an uncontrolled use of antibiotics, vaccination is the most promising approach to control disease.168",

Eradication of the pathogen has a failure rate of more than 30% in pediatric patients, particularly because of poor compliance, antibiotic resistance, and occurrence of side effects.169 Treatment regimens generally include a proton-pump inhibitor (lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, dexlansoprazole, or esomeprazole), which allows the tissues damaged by the infection to heal, and two antibiotics to reduce the risk of treatment failure and antibiotic resistance. Treatment requires several medications for 7\u201314 days. In pediatric patients, gastric mucosal lesion-caused H. pylori infection is a reversible process, and the eradication of this infection not only stops the activity of the inflammatory process but also restores the mucous membranes, reduces the incidence of recurrence of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, and can lead to prevention of malignant disease in 70%\u201380% of cases.170 Adjuvant therapy with probiotics has been studied in recent years.169 In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, children on H. pylori eradication therapy receiving seven strains of probiotic in addition to the standard triple regimen (omeprazole + amoxicillin + claritromicin or omeprazole + amoxycillin + furazolidon) were compared with patients on the same triple regimen receiving placebo. The findings reported a significant reduction in treatment complications and an improved therapeutic outcome: the rate of eradication was significantly higher, and children had a lower rate of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea during treatment.168 The long-term success of H. pylori eradication interventions for preventing gastric cancer, depends on the recurrence determinants (nonadherence and demographics) that are as important as a specific antibiotic regimen.171",

            "text": "Antibiotics are usually avoided in mild Shigella illness, because mild forms of Shigella dysentery are said to be self limiting, some Shigella strains are resistant to antibiotics, and their use may lead to increased resistance. If necessary, in severe cases, the choice of antibiotic to use as first line against Shigella dysentery should be governed by periodically updated local antibiotic sensitivity patterns of Shigella isolates. Other supportive and preventive measures recommended by the WHO should also be instituted along with antibiotics (eg, health education and hand-washing). Ciprofloxacin has been recommended by the WHO as the drug of choice for all patients with bloody diarrhea, irrespective of their ages.172 According to a recent Cochrane review, the authors did not find robust evidence to suggest that antibiotics of a particular class are better than those belonging to a different class. Trials report that at various periods of time, different antibiotics have been effective against isolates of Shigella dysentery in different parts of the world. These are ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, pivmecillinam, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. However, limited data from a subgroup of studies suggest that a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) would be more effective than a beta-lactam (ampicillin) in reducing diarrhea among adults, and that beta-lactams would be more effective than fluoroquinolones in reducing diarrhea among children with proven Shigella dysentery. Emerging drug resistance to ciprofloxacin and second-line drugs such as pivmecillinam, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin is increasingly being reported in many parts of the world, as is multiple-drug resistance.173,174 In India, for example, several Shigella strains (S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S. sonnei) isolated from children \u2264 15 years of age are resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid. Alternatives include ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but ceftriaxone is an injectable drug and azithromycin has limited therapeutic benefit, as organisms easily develop resistance to it.175 It has been noted that all Shigella spp utilize a type III secretion system to translocate bacterial proteins \u2013 invasins IpaA-D and IpgD \u2013 into host eukaryotic cells to initiate infection. Because they are common to all virulent Shigella spp, they seem to be ideal candidate antigens for a subunit-based broad-spectrum protective vaccine for prevention of shigellosis.176",

Efficacy and safety were demonstrated in comparison with liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole. The most appropriate dose in children weighing less than 40 kg is 2 mg/kg/day in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and or gastroenteritis and 1 mg/kg/day as prophylaxis. In premature infants, the most appropriate doses to achieve appropriate levels in the brain parenchyma are 7 mg/kg/day in infants weighing more than 1,000 g and 10 mg/kg/day in those weighing less than 1,000 g, respectively.

In rich countries, transmission occurs much more frequently from contaminated food compared to direct person-to-person contact, except for enteric viruses, which can also be transmitted by aerosol formation after vomiting. Most cases of AGE in children are viral, self-limited, and need only supportive treatment. Rehydration (oral or intravenous) with an appropriate fluid-and-electrolyte balance, with close attention to nutrition, remains central to therapy: this may turn into an additional benefit in limiting hospitalizations.",

In cases of severe infectious diarrhea with a prolonged course, signs of inflammation, bloody stool, immunosuppression, and comorbidity, and in suspected outbreaks, fecal microbial analysis, should always be performed, and a specific therapy should be considered if indicated to shorten the clinical course, eradicate causative organisms, reduce transmission, and prevent invasive complications. Selection of antibacterials to use in acute bacterial gastroenteritis is based on clinical diagnosis of the likely pathogen and on definitive laboratory results. Based on epidemiological data and after collecting organic materials for etiological diagnosis (often a single fecal sample studied for etiologic agents is the customary way to make an etiologic diagnosis), an initial empiric therapy may be appropriate in case of a severe illness, particularly in infancy and the immunocompromised. In case of suspected EHEC serotype O157 and EAEC serotype O104:H4 (but also of Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1), as it is estimated that 5%\u20138% of infected individuals will develop HUS following STEC infection with E. coli O157:H7 the most commonly involved serotype, antibiotics should be prescribed according to more recent guidelines. Moreover, a major concern is the emergence of antibacterial-resistant strains due to the widespread use of antibacterial agents: a continuous monitoring of antibiotic resistance in diarrhea-related bacterial pathogens is recommended. The benefits and risks of adverse drug reactions should be weighed before prescribing any kind of drug.",
