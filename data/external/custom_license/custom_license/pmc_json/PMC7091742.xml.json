These small mammals have many unique features that attract great attention and can now be more commonly found in many research centers1.

The order Chiroptera is divided into suborders Microchiroptera and Megachiroptera, with further subdivision into 18 families and 1,116 recognized species.",

Therefore, bats should be kept in their optimal temperature zone at all times, actively heated when anesthetized; furthermore, the use of alcohol-based scrub solutions can cause further heat loss and should be avoided.
