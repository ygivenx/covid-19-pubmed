Subsequent evolution involved the emergence of DNA, the dedicated genomic material, and proteins, the ultimate operational molecules. RNA molecules remained central for translating information from genes to proteins (mRNA), for the functioning of the translation machinery itself (rRNA and tRNA), and for a variety of regulatory functions (various classes of noncoding RNA that are increasingly discovered in all life forms) (3). Viruses with RNA genomes (referred to as \u201cRNA viruses\u201d here) that do not involve DNA in their genome replication and expression cycles (4, 5) can be considered to represent the closest extant recapitulation and, possibly, a relic of the primordial RNA world.",

The +RNA viruses use the simplest possible strategy of replication and expression as the same molecule functions as both genome and mRNA (7). Most likely, the first replicators to emerge in the RNA world, after the evolution of translation, resembled +RNA viruses (8). Because the +RNA released from a virion can be directly used for translation to produce viral proteins, virions of +RNA viruses contain only structural proteins, in addition to the genome. In contrast, \u2212RNA and dsRNA viruses package their transcription and replication machineries into their virions because these are necessary to initiate the virus reproduction cycles (9, 10).",

Only one family of +RNA viruses (Leviviridae) and one family of dsRNA viruses (Cystoviridae) are formally recognized, and furthermore, their members have limited host ranges. No \u2212RNA viruses have been isolated from prokaryotes (4, 11, 12). Although recent metagenomic studies suggest that genetic diversity and host range of prokaryotic RNA viruses could be substantially underestimated (13, 14), it appears that the scope of the prokaryotic RNA virome is incomparably less than that of the DNA virome. As discussed previously, potential causes of the vast expansion of the RNA virome in eukaryotes might include the emergence of the compartmentalized cytosol that provided a hospitable, protective environment for RNA replication that is known to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and other membrane compartments (11). Conversely, the nuclear envelope could be a barrier that prevents the access of DNA viruses to the host replication and transcription machineries and thus partially relieves the stiff competition that DNA viruses of prokaryotes represent for RNA viruses.",

            "text": "In sharp contrast, the 3 Baltimore classes of RNA viruses dominate the eukaryotic virosphere (11, 15). Eukaryotes from all major taxa are hosts to RNA viruses, and, particularly in plants and invertebrates, these viruses are enormously abundant and diverse (15\u201317). Until recently, the study of RNA viromes had been heavily skewed toward viruses infecting humans, livestock, and agricultural plants. Because of these limitations and biases, the results of attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary history of RNA viruses were bound to be incomplete. Nonetheless, these studies have yielded important generalizations. A single gene encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is universal among RNA viruses, including capsidless RNA replicons but excluding some satellite viruses (18). Even within each of the 3 Baltimore classes, virus genomes do not include fully conserved genes other than those encoding RdRps (15). However, several hallmark genes are shared by broad ranges of RNA viruses, including, most notably, those encoding capsid proteins of icosahedral and helical virions of +RNA viruses (19, 20) and those encoding key enzymes involved in virus replication such as distinct helicases and capping enzymes (15).",

However, obtaining strongly supported phylogenies for RdRps is a difficult task due to the extensive sequence divergence, apart from several conserved motifs that are required for polymerase activity (21\u201323). RdRps belong to the expansive class of polymerases containing so-called Palm catalytic domains along with the accessory Fingers and Thumb domains (24, 25). In addition to viral RdRps, Palm domain polymerases include reverse transcriptases (RTs) of retroelements and reverse-transcribing viruses and the DNA polymerases that are responsible for genome replication in cellular organisms and diverse DNA viruses. Within the Palm domain class of proteins, RT and the +RNA virus RdRps are significantly similar in sequence and structure and appear to comprise a monophyletic group (22, 24\u201326). More specifically, the highest similarity is observed between the +RNA virus RdRps and the RTs of group II introns. These introns are widespread retrotransposons in prokaryotes that are thought to be ancestral to the RTs of all other retrotransposons as well as retroviruses and pararetroviruses (recently jointly classified as the order Ortervirales) of eukaryotes (27\u201330).",

The origin of eukaryotic +RNA viruses from their prokaryotic counterparts is an obvious possibility. However, given the dramatically greater prevalence of +RNA viruses among eukaryotes compared to the narrow spread of leviviruses and \u201clevi-like viruses\u201d in bacteria, an alternative scenario has been proposed. In this scenario, RdRps of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic +RNA viruses independently descended from distinct RTs (11, 31). Among eukaryotic +RNA viruses, phylogenetic analysis of the RdRps strongly supports the existence of picornavirus and alphavirus \u201csupergroups,\u201d which are further validated by additional signature genes (7, 15). However, both the exact compositions of these supergroups and the evolutionary relationships among many additional groups of viruses remain uncertain. Some RdRp phylogenies suggest a third supergroup combining animal \u201cflavi-like viruses\u201d and plant tombusviruses, but this unification is not supported by additional shared genes and thus remains tenuous (7, 15, 21).",

In particular, to build a phylogenetic tree of thousands of viral RdRps, we designed an iterative computational procedure that alternates phylogeny construction with refinement of the underlying multiple alignments. Although RNA viruses have relatively short genomes (\u223c3 to 41 kb), the combined gene repertoire (pangenome) of these viruses includes numerous genes that are shared, to various degrees, by related subsets of RNA viruses. To obtain further insight into virus evolution, we therefore attempted to reconstruct the history of gain and loss of conserved proteins and domains in different virus lineages. We also investigated evolution of the single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP), the dominant type of capsid protein among +RNA viruses. Our analysis revealed patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provide further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses. Finally, we analyzed a bipartite network in which RNA virus genomes are connected via nodes representing virus genes (44, 45) to identify distinct modules in the RNA virosphere. The results shed light on the evolution of RNA viruses, revealing, in particular, the monophyly of \u2212RNA viruses and their apparent origin from dsRNA viruses, which seem to have evolved from distinct branches of +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions.",

Many such lineages consist of viruses newly discovered by metaviromics and are not yet formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and therefore cannot be assigned formal names. For the purpose of the present work, we adopted a semiarbitrary naming scheme using the following approach. (i) We use taxon names that had been fully accepted by the ICTV as of March 2018 (47) whenever possible. These names are recognizable through their capitalization and italicization and rank-specific suffixes (e.g., -virales for orders and -viridae for families). As is the common practice in virus taxonomy, the officially classified members of each ICTV-approved taxon are referred to via vernacular designations (recognizable through their lack of capitalization and italicization). For instance, the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses. However, in this work, both taxon and vernacular terms are to be understood sensu lato: if our analysis indicates certain viruses to be members of or very closely related to an ICTV-established taxon, we consider them members of that taxon despite the lack of current ICTV recognition. As a result, the order Bunyavirales has more members in our analysis than in the official taxonomy. (ii) We use vernacular names in quotation marks for viruses/lineages that are clearly distinct from those covered by the official ICTV framework. Whenever possible, we use names that circulate in the literature (e.g., \u201chepeliviruses,\u201d \u201cstatoviruses\u201d). In the absence of such unofficial names, we name the lineage reminiscent of the next most closely related lineage (e.g., \u201clevi-like viruses\u201d are a clearly distinct sister group to Leviviridae/leviviruses). (iii) Monophyletic clusters that transcend the currently highest ICTV-accepted rank (i.e., order) are labeled according to terms circulating in the literature (i.e., \u201calphavirus supergroup,\u201d \u201cflavivirus supergroup,\u201d and \u201cpicornavirus supergroup\u201d). (iv) Lineages represented by a single virus are labeled with the respective virus name.",

This tree topology is compatible with the monophyly of the RdRps and, by inference, of RNA viruses and the origin of eukaryotic RNA viruses from a prokaryotic RNA virus ancestor shared with leviviruses. The deeper history remains murky. We have no information on the nature of the common ancestor of retroelements and RNA viruses, let alone on whether the ancestor was an RNA virus or a retroelement.

One major group of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses is firmly embedded within +RNA virus branch 2, whereas another, the members of a larger dsRNA virus group that includes cystoviruses, reoviruses, totiviruses, and viruses from several other families comprise a distinct branch, branch 4, which might be related to +RNA virus branch 3 (Fig. 1). This placement of the two branches of dsRNA viruses is conceptually compatible with the previous evolutionary scenarios of independent origins from +RNA viruses. However, the presence of a strongly supported branch combining 3 lineages of dsRNA viruses that infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests a lesser extent of polyphyly in the evolution of dsRNA viruses than originally proposed (15, 32).",

Instead, branches 4 and 5 are separate and positioned deep in the tree, immediately above the split between branch 1 and the rest of the RdRps.

The current RdRp tree topology combined with gene gain-loss reconstruction suggests the following evolutionary scenario for branch 1 (Fig. 2A): a levivirus-like ancestor that, like the extant members of the Leviviridae, possessed a capsid protein unrelated to SJR-CP (19, 52) gave rise to naked eukaryotic RNA replicons known as \u201cmitoviruses\u201d and \u201cnarnaviruses.\u201d These replicons consist of a single RdRp gene (Fig. 2B) and replicate in mitochondria and in the cytosol of the host cells of fungal and invertebrate hosts, respectively (the latter hosts were identified in metaviromic holobiont analyses) (14, 53). Recently, the existence of plant \u201cmitoviruses\u201d has been reported although it is not known whether these viruses reproduce in the mitochondria (54). The \u201cnarnavirus\u201d RdRp is also the ancestor of the RdRp of the expanding group of \u201courmiaviruses\u201d (Fig. 2A). \u201cOurmiaviruses\u201d were originally identified in a narrow range of plants, and genomic analysis revealed the chimeric nature of these viruses, with a \u201cnarnavirus\u201d-like RdRp but SJR-CPs and movement proteins (MPs) which were apparently acquired from \u201cpicorna-like\u201d and \u201ctombus-like\u201d viruses, respectively (55). Use of metaviromics has led to the identification of numerous related viruses associated with invertebrates, many of which encode distinct SJR-CP variants and some of which acquired an RNA helicase (Fig. 2B and S2) (14). Thus, the evolution of this branch apparently involved the loss of the structural module of leviviruses, which yielded naked RNA replicons that reproduced in the mitochondria of early eukaryotes. A group of these replicons subsequently escaped to the cytosol, which was followed by the reacquisition of unrelated structural modules from distinct lineages of eukaryotic viruses inhabiting the same environment (Fig. 2B). This complex evolutionary scenario emphasizes the key role of modular gene exchange in the evolution of RNA viruses.",

Some of the virus groups that were previously considered peripheral members of this supergroup, such as totiviruses and nodaviruses, were relocated to different branches in the present tree (branches 4 and 3, respectively), whereas the viruses of the order Nidovirales were moved inside branch 2 from an uncertain position in the tree. Nevertheless, the core of the supergroup remains coherent, suggestive of common ancestry. Within branch 2, 3 major clades are strongly supported (Fig. 3A); however, many of the internal branches are less reliable, so that the relative positions of partitivirus-picobirnavirus, potyvirus-astrovirus, and nidovirus clades within branch 2 remain uncertain.",

The second largest, deep-branching clade consists of two lineages that include, respectively, +RNA and dsRNA viruses (Fig. 3). The +RNA virus lineage combines astroviruses and potyviruses, the evolutionary affinity of which is well recognized (31, 60). The dsRNA lineage includes the members of the families Amalgaviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Picobirnaviridae, with each of these families greatly expanded by unclassified affiliates. Finally, the \u201cmiddle\u201d clade is smaller and less diverse; it encompasses nidoviruses, including the longest of all +RNA virus genomes (61), and solemoviruses with much shorter genomes (Fig. 3). Notably, some members of the family Luteoviridae and Heterocapsa circularisquama RNA virus, the only known alvernavirus (62), are nested within the solemovirus clade. Given the lack of support beyond the phylogenetic affinity of the RdRps and the dramatic differences in the genomic architectures of nidoviruses and solemoviruses, the possibility that this unification was caused by a tree construction artifact is difficult to rule out (the branch support notwithstanding).",

            "text": "The partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade within branch 2 represents a transition to the bona fide dsRNA Baltimore class (Fig. 3). Typical partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses have minimalist genomes that consist of two dsRNA segments encapsidated separately into distinct 120-subunit T=1 capsids (65\u201368). These genome segments encode, respectively, RdRps and CPs that are clearly homologous between the two families. The CPs of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade have been suggested to be distantly related to those of other dsRNA viruses that belong to branch 4 (33, 69). Notably, this clade also includes some naked RNA replicons that reproduce in algal mitochondria or chloroplasts, use a mitochondrial genetic code, and, in terms of lifestyle, resemble \u201cmitoviruses\u201d (14, 70, 71). By analogy, the origin of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus group in an as-yet-undiscovered lineage of prokaryotic RNA viruses seems likely. More specifically, this group of dsRNA viruses could have evolved through reassortment of genomic segments encoding, respectively, a +RNA virus RdRp of branch 2 (possibly a naked RNA replicon) and a dsRNA virus capsid protein related to those of branch 4 viruses. The most recently evolved branch of partitiviruses is characterized by larger, 4- to 6-partite genomes, in contrast to the mono- or bipartite genomes in the deeper branches (14). This observation emphasizes a major tendency in virus evolution: increases in genome complexity via gradual acquisition of accessory genes (72).",

            "text": "The reconstruction of protein gain and loss, together with the comparison of genome architectures in this branch, revealed extensive rearrangements as well as gene and module displacement (Fig. 3B; see also Fig. S2B). Branch 2 includes viruses with relatively long genomes and complex gene repertoires (nidoviruses, potyviruses, and many members of Picornavirales) along with viruses with much shorter genomes and minimal sets of genes (astroviruses and solemoviruses). Clearly, evolution of branch 2 viruses involved multiple gene gains. Of special note is the gain of 3 distinct helicases in 3 clades within this branch: superfamily 3 helicases (S3H) in members of Picornavirales, superfamily 2 helicases (S2H) in potyviruses, and superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) in nidoviruses (Fig. 3B; see also Fig. S2B). This independent, convergent gain of distinct helicases reflects the trend noticed early in the study of RNA virus evolution, namely, that most viruses with genomes longer than \u223c6 kb encode helicases, whereas smaller ones do not. This difference conceivably exists because helicase activity is required for the replication of longer RNA genomes (73). Another notable feature is the change of virion morphologies among potyviruses (replacement of ancestral SJR-CP by an unrelated CP forming filamentous virions) and nidoviruses (displacement by a distinct nucleocapsid protein). The dramatic change in virion morphology and mode of genome encapsidation might have been necessitated by the inability of SJR-CP-based icosahedral capsids to accommodate the larger genomes of the ancestral potyviruses and nidoviruses. In addition, nidoviruses gained capping enzymes (CapE) (Fig. 3B; see also Fig. S2B) that most likely were acquired independently of the capping enzymes of other RNA viruses. Nidoviruses also gained ribonucleases and other accessory proteins that are involved in genome replication, virulence, and other aspects of the infection cycle of these largest known RNA viruses (61, 74\u201376).",

This branch consists of two strongly supported clades of +RNA viruses: (i) the assemblage that originally was defined as the \u201calphavirus supergroup\u201d (7, 15) joined by several additional groups of viruses and (ii) flaviviruses and related viruses (\u201cflavivirus supergroup\u201d; Fig. 1 and 4). In the former clade, the alphavirus supergroup encompasses an enormous diversity of plant, fungal, and animal +RNA viruses and consists of 3 well-supported lineages, namely, tymoviruses, virgaviruses/alphaviruses/endornaviruses, and hepeviruses/benyviruses, each accompanied by related viruses that often form as-yet-unclassified lineages (Fig. 4A). Within the \u201calphavirus supergroup\u201d alone, the genome lengths range from \u223c6 to \u223c20 kb. Despite this length variation, all supergroup members harbor a conserved RNA replication gene module encoding a CapE, S1H, and RdRp; the conservation of this module attests to the monophyly of the supergroup (Fig. 4B).",

It was traditionally thought that the latter capsid type is specific to viruses of flowering plants (20). However, the recent discovery of a virgavirus-like CP in invertebrate viruses (e.g., B\u011bih\u01cei charybdis crab virus 1 [Fig. 4B]) (14) suggests that the emergence of this unique CP fold antedates land colonization by plants at \u223c100 million years ago (Mya). Yet another \u201cstructural\u201d theme is offered by endornaviruses, naked RNA replicons which, similarly to the hypoviruses in branch 2 (see above), originally were classified as dsRNA viruses. However, endornaviruses possess all the hallmarks of the alphavirus supergroup and are clearly derived from +RNA viruses of this group. They seem to have been mislabeled dsRNA viruses due to the accumulation of dsRNA replication intermediates in infected cells (18, 77). A parallel loss of the CP genes apparently occurred in the deltaflexiviruses, which, in RdRp phylogenies, form a sister group to the flexible filamentous gammaflexiviruses (78), and in the umbraviruses that are included in the family Tombusviridae based on the RdRp phylogeny. Notably, unlike most other capsidless viruses that are vertically inherited, umbraviruses can hijack capsids of coinfecting luteoviruses for aphid transmission (79).",

            "text": "The previously suggested, tenuous Flaviviridae-Tombusviridae affinity is gone in the present tree, although members of both families belong to the same major branch, branch 3. Plant tombusviruses (and members of closely related plant virus genera), representing the only group of \u201ctombus-like viruses\u201d that was available at the time of previous analyses (7, 21), now form but a small twig deep within the large assemblage that we refer to as tombusviruses. Tombusviruses are affiliated with \u201cstatoviruses\u201d (80) and with a subset of unclassified viruses from invertebrate holobionts rather than with flaviviruses (Fig. 4A). Flaviviruses now form a separate clade within branch 3, the flavivirus supergroup that includes members of four recognized flaviviral genera (Pegivirus, Hepacivirus, Flavivirus, and Pestivirus), the newly discovered \u201cj\u012bngm\u00e9nviruses\u201d with segmented genomes (38), and a variety of unclassified, extremely divergent \u201cflavi-like viruses\u201d of animals and plants. This clade is split into two well-supported lineages; one includes pegiviruses and hepaciviruses, and the other consists of the rest of flaviviruses (Fig. 4A). Flaviviral virions are enveloped, with the envelope proteins forming an external icosahedral shell, whereas the core nucleocapsid is apparently disordered; the evolutionary provenance of the core protein, with its distinct fold, is unclear (19, 82, 83). Notably, flaviviral envelope proteins are class II fusion proteins that are closely related to alphavirus envelope E1 proteins (84). The theme of gene swapping between these distantly related virus groups of branch 3 is further emphasized by the homology between the alphavirus CPs that form icosahedral capsids under the lipid envelopes and the flavivirus nonstructural NS3 proteases that share a chymotrypsin-like fold (84). Because the RdRp tree topology implies that the alphavirus ancestor is more recent than the ancestor of flaviviruses (Fig. 1), such adoption of the NS3 protease for a structural role is suggestive of emerging alphaviruses borrowing their structural module from preexisting flaviviruses (19).",

A highly divergent version of CapE has been identified in nodaviruses (85) and, in our present analysis, in the additional subset of viruses that grouped with nodaviruses, as well as in a few viruses scattered throughout the clade. Formally, CapE is inferred to be ancestral in the entire branch 3. However, CapEs of \u201calphavirus supergroup\u201d members, nodaviruses, and flaviviruses are related only distantly to one another, and at least the latter have closer eukaryotic homologs, namely, the FtsJ family methyltransferases (86, 87). Furthermore, tombusviruses, statoviruses, y\u00e0nviruses, zh\u00e0oviruses, w\u00e8iviruses, and members of the Pegivirus-Hepacivirus lineage of flaviviruses lack CapE, putting into question its presence in the ancestor of this branch (Fig. 4B; see also Fig. S2B). The most credible evolutionary scenario seems to involve convergent acquisition of CapEs on at least 3 independent occasions, recapitulating the apparent history of helicases in branch 2 (see above) (Fig. 3B; see also Fig. S2B). The trend of the capture of helicases by +RNA viruses with longer genomes also holds in branch 3 and includes the acquisition of S1H at the base of the alphavirus supergroup and of S2H by the ancestral flavivirus (Fig. 4B; see also Fig. S2B).",

In the case of the clade encompassing the \u201calphavirus supergroup\u201d and related viruses, a potential common ancestor could be a simple virus that encoded only an RdRp and a SJR-CP, a CP fold most broadly represented in this clade, including diverse tombusviruses, nodaviruses and members of Bromoviridae, and Tymoviridae within the \u201calphavirus supergroup.\u201d Proposal of such an ancestor for the flavivirus clade is challenged by the lack of viruses with short and simple genomes among flaviviruses. Indeed, the lengths of the genomes in this clade range from \u223c9 kb to \u223c26 kb, with even the shortest ones encoding at least three of the flavivirus signature genes (serine protease [Spro], S2H, and RdRp). One potential clue, however, is provided by \u201cj\u012bngm\u00e9nviruses,\u201d with tetrapartite genomes in which the protease-helicase modules and the RdRps are encoded by separate genome segments; two other segments apparently encode structural proteins of unclear provenance (38). This genome architecture could hint at an ancestral flavivirus genome that was assembled from genes borrowed from preexisting viruses, one of which possessed a divergent \u201ctombus-like virus\u201d RdRp. Although the origins of branch 3 are murky, major trends in its subsequent evolution clearly included lineage-specific gene capture, starting with helicases and CapEs in the ancestors of the major lineages and followed by diverse genes in smaller groups (Fig. 4B).",

All dsRNA viruses in this branch share a unique virion organization and encode homologous CPs. In particular, the specialized icosahedral capsids of these viruses, involved in transcription and replication of the dsRNA genome inside cells, are constructed from 60 homo- or heterodimers of CP subunits organized on an unusual T=1 (also known as pseudo-T=2) lattice (69, 91). The only exceptions are the chrysoviruses, which encode large CPs corresponding to the CP dimers of other dsRNA viruses and form genuine T=1 capsids (92). The icosahedral capsids of partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses, which encode RdRps belonging to branch 2, are also constructed from 60 homodimers (66, 67, 93) and have been suggested to be evolutionarily related to those of the dsRNA viruses from RdRp branch 4 (94) despite little structural similarity between the corresponding CPs. Totiviruses, many of which have \u201cminimal\u201d genomes encoding only RdRps and CPs, comprise one of the two major clades in branch 4, whereas cystoviruses, the only known prokaryotic dsRNA viruses, together with members of the vast family Reoviridae, which consists of multisegmented dsRNA viruses infecting diverse eukaryotes, comprise the second clade (Fig. 5). The concept of the closer phylogenetic affinity between cystoviruses and reoviruses appears to be corroborated by the fact that the inner T=1 icosahedral capsid is uniquely encased by the outer icosahedral shell constructed on a T=13 lattice in both families (34). Both cystoviruses and reoviruses appear to have gained many clade-specific genes, in particular, RecA-like packaging ATPases of the former (95) and the CapEs of the latter that are only distantly related to CapEs of other RNA viruses and likely were acquired independently (96, 97) (Fig. 5; see also Fig. S2B).",

The first clade encompasses the 348 viruses-strong membership of the order Mononegavirales (98), along with the members of the distantly related family Aspiviridae (99), 3 groups of \u2212RNA viruses discovered through metaviromics (\u201cch\u01d4viruses,\u201d \u201cq\u00ednviruses,\u201d and \u201cyu\u00e8viruses\u201d) (14, 39), and a group of unclassified fungal viruses (Fig. 6A) (42, 100). In contrast to the members of the Mononegavirales, most of which possess unsegmented genomes, the remainder of this clade is characterized by bi-, tri-, or even tetrasegmented genomes (Fig. 6B). The second clade combines the family Orthomyxoviridae, the genus Tilapinevirus (101), and the large order Bunyavirales (394 viruses) (102). The latter order consists of two branches, one of which is the sister group to the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus clade (albeit with weak support). The numbers of negative-sense or ambisense genome segments in this clade range from 2 to 3 in most of bunyaviruses to 8 in viruses of the genus Emaravirus and the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus group (10, 99, 101, 103). A notable acquisition in the first clade is a CapE, whereas members of the second clade share \u201ccap-snatching\u201d endonucleases (En) (10).",

The short length and high divergence of SJR-CPs preclude adequate resolution in phylogenetic analysis; thus, we performed profile-profile sequence comparisons and clustering of all viral SJR-CP sequences in our data set (see Materials and Methods for details). Analysis of the resulting network reveals patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provides further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses.",

Only \u201courmiaviruses\u201d had stronger affinity to picornaviruses in cluster 1 (Fig. 7). This pattern of connectivity is consistent with the radiation of SJR-CPs from a common ancestor, likely resembling sequences from cluster 2 of branch 2. This analysis also reveals high CP sequence divergence among members of some families (e.g., Bromoviridae) and numerous cases of apparent CP gene replacement. For instance, the CPs of nodaviruses fall into two groups; one is related to the turreted CPs of tetraviruses, and the other is similar to CPs of tombusviruses, mirroring the RdRp phylogeny (Fig. 7). At a greater phylogenetic distance, CPs of astroviruses and hepeviruses are closely related despite their affiliation with branches 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting CP gene replacement in the ancestor of one of the two families. Given that the CPs of hepeviruses connect to SJR-CPs of other viruses through astroviruses, CP gene replacement most likely occurred in the ancestor of hepeviruses (Fig. S3). Notably, the CPs of \u201czh\u00e0oviruses,\u201d \u201cw\u00e8iviruses,\u201d and \u201ctombus-like\u201d and \u201csobemo-like\u201d viruses (representing a diverse virus assemblage within the solemovirus branch, to the exclusion of bona fide Solemoviridae) did not form discrete clusters but rather were affiliated with diverse virus groups, suggesting extensive recombination in these viruses, with multiple CP gene exchanges (Fig. 7). In the case of unclassified \u201cnarnaviruses\u201d and \u201courmiaviruses,\u201d the CP genes apparently were acquired on more than 3 independent occasions from different groups of viruses, emphasizing the impact of recombination and gene shuffling in the evolution of RNA viruses. Previously, a similar extent of chimerism was also observed among single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses (104, 105), highlighting the evolutionary and functional plasticity of short viral genomes.",

Therefore, a productive approach to the study of the virosphere that complements phylogenetics is the construction and analysis of networks of gene sharing. Bipartite networks, in which one type of node corresponds to genes and another to genomes, have been employed to investigate the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) domain of the virosphere (45). This analysis revealed hierarchical modular organization of the network, with several modules that included nonobvious connections between disparate groups of viruses (44, 106). Although this type of analysis is less informative for RNA viruses due to the small number of proteins encoded in each viral genome, the \u201cpan-proteome\u201d of RNA viruses is large (Data Set S5), prompting us to experiment with bipartite gene sharing networks for RNA viruses. The initial search for statistically significant modularity identified 54 distinct modules, most of which included a single virus family (Fig. 8A and B). Remarkably, the family Reoviridae has been split into 5 modules, highlighting the vast diversity of this family, comparable to that seen in order-level taxa. Among the exceptions, the most expansive module included the viruses of the order Picornavirales (module 29), together with those of the family Caliciviridae (module 47), which are linked through the conserved suite of genes that includes those encoding SJR-CP, chymotrypsin-like protease, S3H, and the RdRp (Fig. 8A and C). Viruses of the order Bunyavirales were also recovered in a single module characterized by the presence of a conserved nucleocapsid (with the exception of the families Nairoviridae and Arenaviridae) and the cap-snatching endonuclease (module 51; Fig. 8A and C).",

Specifically, 8 overlapping supermodules were identified (Fig. 8C). The largest and, arguably, most remarkable is a supermodule that combines +RNA, dsRNA, and \u2212RNA viruses that share the capping enzymes, S1H (with the exception of Reoviridae and Mononegavirales), and additional connector genes (e.g., the OTU family protease) that link some of the constituent modules.

However, an alternative scenario might be considered. No known prokaryotic viruses are classified in branch 2, but it has been proposed that the picobirnaviruses, for which no hosts have been reliably identified, actually are prokaryotic viruses. This proposal is based on the conspicuous conservation of functional, bacterium-type, ribosome-binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) in picobirnavirus genomes (107, 108). Should that be the case, viruses of prokaryotes might be lurking among totiviruses as well. Then, branch 4 would stem from a prokaryotic ancestor, obviating the need to invoke virus transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes to explain the origin of the cystoviruses.",

By design, for all branches, entropy (host diversity) drops from the maximum values at the root to zero at the leaves. All branches show substantial host range diversity such that, for example, at the half-distance from the root to the leaves, all branches, except for branch 1, retain at least half of the diversity (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the differences between the branches are substantial, with the highest entropy observed in branch 4 (dsRNA viruses) and branch 5 (\u2212RNA viruses).

Indeed, +RNA viruses use the simplest genomic strategy and, in all likelihood, represent the primary pool of RNA viruses. The dsRNA viruses conceivably evolved when a +RNA virus switched to encapsidating a replicative intermediate (dsRNA) together with the RdRp. Naked replicons similar to those of \u201cmitoviruses,\u201d hypoviruses, and endornaviruses might have been evolutionary intermediates in this process. This switch does not seem to be as \u201ceasy\u201d and common as previously suspected (15, 32) but, nevertheless, appears to have occurred at least twice during the evolution of RNA viruses. The origin of \u2212RNA viruses is the next step during which the plus strand is discarded from the virions, perhaps simplifying the processes of transcription and replication. Conceivably, the evolution of dsRNA and \u2212RNA viruses, in which transcription and replication of the viral genomes were confined to the interior of virions or nucleocapsid transcription/replication complexes and no dsRNA accumulated in the infected cells, was driven by the advantage of escaping some of the host defense mechanisms, in particular, RNA interference (RNAi) (109, 110). The membrane-associated replication complexes of +RNA viruses could represent an initial step in this direction (9).",

The ancestors of each of the major branches of RNA viruses (except for branch 1) appear to have been simply organized +RNA viruses resembling tombusviruses (Fig. 10).

Notably, similar levels of complexity, with a complete coding capacity of 20 to 40 kb, were reached independently in 4 branches of the RdRp tree, namely, branch 2 (coronaviruses), branch 3 (closteroviruses and flaviviruses), branch 4 (reoviruses), and branch 5 (filoviruses and paramyxoviruses) (Fig. 3 and 6).",

For example, it appears that all dsRNA viruses in the two major clades within branches 2 and 4 share homologous structural modules that combine with distinct RdRps. At least in the case of partiti-picobirnaviruses in branch 2, the dsRNA virus (\u201ctoti-like virus\u201d) CP apparently displaced the ancestral SJR-CP. However, this particular protein structure does not seem to be essential to encapsidate a dsRNA genome; birnaviruses, whose provenance is uncertain due to the permutation in their RdRps, retain SJR-CP, which is most closely related to SJR-CP of nodaviruses and tetraviruses (19). An even more striking example of module shuffling is presented by amalgaviruses, dsRNA viruses that group with partitiviruses in the RdRp tree but encode a distant homolog of the nucleocapsid protein of \u2212RNA bunyaviruses (111\u2013114). More generally, structural and replication modules have been repeatedly shuffled during the evolution of +RNA viruses. Examples include displacement of the ancestral SJR-CP by a filamentous CP in potyviruses and by a helical nucleocapsid protein in nidoviruses and multiple cases of displacement with rod-shaped-like CP and unique nucleocapsid proteins in branch 3. Thus, exchange of genes and gene modules among RNA viruses is pervasive and can cross the boundaries of Baltimore classes.",

The results of the analyses of evolutionary relationships between viruses with distinct host ranges are supported not only by the phylogeny of the RdRp but also by the fact that these viruses share additional conserved domains, such as, for example, SJR1, S3H, and 3C-Pro in the case of Picornavirales members infecting protists, plants, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates (Fig. 3).",

Viruses identified in holobiont samples of (for example) invertebrates could actually infect protists associated with these animals (50) or could represent contamination from fungal or plant or even prokaryotic sources. These uncertainties notwithstanding, the extensive diversity of hosts even within small branches of the RdRp tree is undeniable. A coevolution scenario in which the ancestors of all these viruses originated from the common ancestor of the respective groups of eukaryotes and coevolved with the hosts implies an enormous diversity of RNA viruses in early eukaryotes. This scenario appears to be highly unlikely given the apparent paucity of RNA viruses in the extant protists (although new metaviromic studies might substantially expand the range of protist viruses). The pervasive HVT alternative seems much more plausible, especially given that arthropods, nematodes, and other invertebrates are well known as virus vectors and thus fit the role of RNA virus reservoirs (11).",

Given that viruses of branches 2, 3, and 4 are present in modern protists, it appears likely that these branches emerged in early eukaryotes. However, because of the apparent dominance of the viruses of RdRp branch 2 (members of the \u201cpicornavirus supergroup\u201d in general and of the \u201caquatic picorna-like viruses\u201d clade in particular) in protists, this branch likely diversified first, whereas the diversification of branches 3 and 4 occurred later, after ancestral protist viruses were transferred to marine invertebrates during the Cambrian explosion. Results of the recent analysis of the viromes of ctenophores, sponges, and cnidarians suggest that substantial diversification of RNA viruses had already occurred in these deeply branching metazoa (120). Invertebrates brought their already highly diverse RNA virome to land at the time of terrestrialization and subsequently inoculated land plants. In land plants, RNA viruses, particularly those of branch 3, dramatically expanded, perhaps in part because of the exclusion of competing large DNA viruses. Finally, it seems plausible that, given the high prevalence of \u2212RNA viruses in metazoa and their virtual absence in protists (with the exception of the recently discovered \u201cleishbuviruses\u201d that likely invaded their parasitic protist hosts via HVT from an animal host [49, 50]), the viruses that comprise RdRp branch 5 evolved in animals via mixing and matching genes from reovirus-like and flavivirus-like ancestors.",

Some of the groups delineated by this method, particularly those among +RNA viruses, are closely similar to those reported here.

The helicase-assisted replication of +RNA genomes created the opportunities for parallel acquisition of additional genes encoding proteins involved in polyprotein processing and virus genome expression, such as proteases and capping enzymes, respectively, and proteins involved in virus-host interactions, such as MPs or RNAi suppressors of plant viruses. In addition to these processes of vertical evolution of RNA viruses, the results from phylogenomic analyses reveal multiple cases of gene module exchange among diverse viruses and pervasive HVT, often between distantly related hosts, such as animals and plants.

Sites containing more than 67% gaps were temporarily removed from alignments, and pairwise similarity scores were obtained for clusters by the use of HHSEARCH. Scores for a pair of clusters were converted to distances as follows: the dA,B = \u2212log[sA,B/min(sA,A,sB,B) formula, in which dA,B is the distance between cluster A and cluster B and sA,B is the HHSEARCH score for the comparison of these clusters, was used to convert scores s to distances d. The matrix of pairwise distances was used to calculate the mean by the unweighted pair group method using average linkages (UPGMA) (128). Shallow tips of the tree were used as the guide tree for a progressive pairwise alignment of the clusters at the tree leaves using HHALIGN (127), resulting in larger clusters. This procedure was reiterative, ultimately resulting in the single alignment of the whole set of 4,640 virus RdRp sequences and 1,028 RT sequences.",

Protein regions that did not have significant hits were extracted and clustered with cluster analysis of sequences (CLANS) (133), and groups containing at least three members were identified, annotated (if possible), and added to the manually annotated profile database.

Highly similar viruses (with identical domain organizations and >94% identical RdRps) were removed from the data set. In addition, only one representative genome was retained for some members of overrepresented species (e.g., Hepacivirus C). Many genomes (e.g., alphaviruses, tombusviruses, and nidoviruses) encoded readthrough proteins, resulting in domains from the shorter protein contained within the longer readthrough protein.

After removal of genomes with fewer than 2 domains and of domains that appeared in less than 3 genomes, the network consisted of 2,829 nodes, of which 2,515 corresponded to genomes and 314 to domains. Genome and domain nodes were connected by links wherever a domain was present in a genome. A consensus community detection approach was used to identify the modules of the network (134, 135). First, we ran 500 replicas with Infomap (136) (bipartite setting, using domains as factors) and built a similarity matrix by assigning to each pair of nodes a similarity value equal to the fraction of replicas in which both nodes were placed in the same module. Then, hierarchical clustering was performed on the similarity matrix, setting the number of clusters equal to the median number of modules obtained in the 500 replicas. Order statistics local optimization method (Oslom) software (137) was subsequently used to filter significant modules with a P value threshold equal to 0.05. To detect higher-order (super)modules, we first identified connector domains as those present in at least 2 modules with prevalence greater than 0.65. The second-order network, composed of 54 modules and 34 connector domains, was searched for second-order modules with Infomap (500 replicas, bipartite setting with connector domains as factors). Due to the small size of the second-order network, consensus community detection did not qualitatively improve the results of the search, and therefore we took the replica with the best Infomap score and skipped hierarchical clustering for this and subsequent steps of the higher-order module search. After assessing statistical significance with Oslom, 4 second-order modules were recovered, encompassing 12 of the original modules associated with closely related virus families. A third-order network was built by pooling the 4 second-order modules with the 46 modules that remained unmerged. The third-order network was analyzed in the same manner to obtain the 9 supermodules. None of these supermodules was assessed by Oslom as significant.",

The network presented in panel A shows viral modules as colored circles (blue, +RNA viruses; green, dsRNA viruses; red, \u2212RNA viruses) linked to the connector genes (black dots) that are present in each module. The size of the circles is proportional to the number of genomes in each module.
