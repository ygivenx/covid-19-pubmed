I sat down with her and, before the school bus arrived, we looked at some interactive maps showing how far the new coronavirus outbreak was from Portugal, the predicted spread, and some World Health Organization recommendations: wash your hands often, sneeze to the elbow, let me know if you are feeling sick\u2015all things that she proudly does already. We found all of this information online in less than 10 minutes.",

They may not have known that \u2018coronavirus\u2019 is a thousand-year-old type of virus, rather than this novel strain (SARS-CoV-2), which causes a disease whose official name is now COVID-19: \u2018CO\u2019 for \u2018corona\u2019 (Spanish for \u2018crown\u2019, because this viral family has spikes on its outside, not because it is transmitted via a popular Mexican beer), \u2018VI\u2019 for virus, \u2018D\u2019 for disease, and \u201819\u2019 for the year in which it was identified. The naming deliberately avoids using geographical location, to minimize stigmatization, or mention of the likely animal host.

Users also seem to be more aware of false information and seem to be more active in flagging it.

It could reinforce conspiracy theories, and it is arguably very difficult to make this decision when it involves high officials, such as presidents. As an alternative, social-media platforms could attempt to implement simple nudges: asking people whether they are sure they want to share something could activate their best judgment and reduce over-confidence; and introducing time delays on the publication of dubious information, while it is being checked, could slow the spreading process and eventually prevent its publication.",
