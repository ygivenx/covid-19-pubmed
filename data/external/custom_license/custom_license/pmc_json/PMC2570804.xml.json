In our study, because the gilt pool was so large, a nonimmune subpopulation very likely existed and might have acted as a potential source of virus multiplication. The severity of clinical signs such as vomiting, emaciation, wasting, and death was greater than that previously reported (10). Factors that might have enhanced the clinical manifestations of the disease were a nonimmune population and the winter season (3,8,10).",

In our study, nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis was found in 50% of infected animals. Our IHC results agreed with findings reported by others in which CoV antigen was detected only in neurons (8,14,15). Detection of amplicons of \u2248250 bp in brain samples was highly suggestive of PHE-CoV because this is the only known neurotropic CoV for pigs (4). In addition, results observed in samples of nervous tissue processed for IHC, RT-PCR, and sequence analysis added further evidence of the precise causal agent of the current outbreak.
