Their multifactorial roots necessitate strategies that go well beyond the traditional health sector. One strategy that has been largely neglected and that can help address several of these issues involves improving the treatment of non-human animals (hereafter \u2018animals'). I briefly describe how EIDs are connected with the treatment of animals and discuss why this connection needs to be addressed in public health strategies. I describe other areas of exploration, including issues concerning domestic violence and medical research.",

A report published by the Pew Commission highlights how close contact of animals facilitates the exchange and evolution of pathogens and how stress induced by dense confinement increases the likelihood of infection and illness in animals.6 Pathogens circulating in these animal populations may lead to human illnesses.",

At some point in the wildlife supply chain, infected bats were likely brought into contact with susceptible hosts, such as civets, in whom the virus amplified.

Successful anti-infectious disease campaigns, for example, often rely on the availability of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics, that in turn, depend on reliable and predictive pre-clinical research. A new study found that the mouse models used extensively to study human inflammatory diseases, including infectious diseases, only poorly mimic the human condition.39 This calls into question the reliability of mouse models to identify, develop, and test drug and vaccine candidates.39",
