PED was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1971 [2]. Since then, the disease has been recognized in many European countries, such as Germany, France and Switzerland, and more recently in Korea and Thailand [3\u20135]. In China, PEDV was first confirmed in 1984 [6], and since 2010, it has caused enteric disease with a devastating impact on the swine-raising industry. This disease is characterized by high morbidity and mortality among preweaning piglets, causing serious economic losses to the swine industry in China [7].",

Molecular epidemiology and virus isolation of PEDV have been undertaken in some regions of China [7, 16\u201319]. These studies are essential for identifying the epidemic characteristics of PEDV and have the potential to provide information about its pathogenesis. Nevertheless, little is known about the antigenic variability of PEDV prevailing currently in the field. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology and antigenic variability of PEDV field strains based on analysis of ORF3 and a portion of the S gene encoding three neutralizing epitopes (aa 499\u2013638, 748\u2013755, and 764\u2013771) of the S protein.

These analyses indicated that the ORF3 gene sequences determined in this study were relatively conserved.

Despite the current vaccination strategy, the losses caused by PEDV infection are continuous and serious. It is necessary to understand the epidemiology of PEDV and to explore the antigenic variation of the virus. During the epidemiologic investigation, we confirmed that PEDV was the predominant causative pathogen contributing to outbreaks of clinical diarrhea in central China and determined that the positive rate of PEDV in all diarrhea samples tested was 78.6 %, followed by rotavirus (11.3 %) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (6.4 %). Co-infections with multiple pathogens in diarrheal disease were very frequent, especially mixed infections with PEDV and porcine group A rotavirus (GARV). These findings are consistent with those reported by Zhang et al. [22]. The 14 samples used in this study were mostly from neonatal piglets (91.3 %), and they were obtained mainly in winter. To further investigate the molecular epidemiology of this virus, we chose the ORF3 gene and a partial S gene encoding a region including three neutralization epitopes for studying the evolutionary characteristic and antigenic variation of PEDV.",

The results confirmed that none of the 14 strains had the 51-nt deletion in ORF3. Sequence comparison with other PEDV reference strains selected from the GenBank database indicated that the ORF3 genes from the sample strains had a high degree of homology to most Chinese strains. For example, CH/LY-09, CH/FCH-01, CH/HEB, and CH/LH were distributed in the same subgroup with CH/ZMDZY/11; CH/YF-01 and CH/KF-01 were in the same subgroup with AH2012; and both CH/ZMDZY/11 and AH2012 were collected previously in central China.

In this study, 14 partial S genes from field PEDV strains were amplified by RT-PCR, cloned, sequenced, and analyzed to study their antigenic variation. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the partial S regions showed relatively high sequence identity among the PEDV strains. In particular, the 14 samples in this study were highly conserved in the neutralizing epitope region aa 245-252, but most of the changes occurred in the core epitope regions of aa 7-146 and aa 271-278. Of these, there were 10 samples with amino acid sequences changes at position 28: from A to V (CH/YF-01, CH/QX-02, CH/KF-01, CH/LSHAN) and A to S (CH/LY-09, CH/FCH-01, CH/LH, CH/XIP-03, CH/ZHZ-04, CH/HEB).

Furthermore, B-cell epitopes were predicted in the region of aa 7-146 using the BepiPred 1.0b Server. The results showed that there were three epitopes with the highest scores in the aa 7-146, located at positions 22-30, 32-40, 64-75. In this study, the amino acid mutation at positions 28, 32, and 74 were distributed within the epitope regions aa 22-30, 32-40, and 64-75, respectively (Fig. 3). These changes might alter the antigenicity of PEDV and consequently result in vaccination failure. Further study is needed to confirm the relationship between amino acid mutations in epitope regions and antigenicity, which would help to improve our understanding of the prevalence of PEDV in China.",
