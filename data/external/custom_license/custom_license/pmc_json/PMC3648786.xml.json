This licence was reviewed by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Ethical Review Committee. Groups of >5 isofluorane-anaesthetised mice of both genotype were intranasally inoculated with 104 PFU of A/X-31 influenza in 50\u03bcl of sterile PBS. In some experiments A/X-31 was substituted with 200 PFU of A/England/195/09 influenza, or 50-103 PFU of A/PR/8/34 (PR/8) or an otherwise isogenic virus with a deletion of the NS1 gene (delNS1)19, made as described23. Their weight was recorded daily and they were monitored for signs of illness. Mice exceeding 25% total weight loss were killed in accordance with UK Home Office guidelines.

The IFITM3 and N\u039421 western blot using the A549 stable cell lines were probed with the anti-IFITM1 antibody from Prosci (Cat# 5807), which recognises a conserved portion of the IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins which is still present even in the absence of the first twenty one N-terminal amino acids. The LCL blots (including the A549 cell line lysate controls) were probed with either an antibody which is specific for the N-terminus of IFITM3 (Rabbit anti-IFITM3 (N-term aa 8-38) (Abgent, #AP1153a)), or with anti-IFITM1 antibody from Prosci (Cat# 5807), as well as Rabbit anti-MX1 (Proteintech, #13750-1-AP) and mouse anti-GAPDH (clone GAPDH-71.1) (Sigma, #G8795). For the LCL immunoblots all antibodies were diluted in DPBS (Sigma) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% non-far dried milk (Carnation) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. All primary antibodies were consequently bound to the corresponding species-appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako).

IFITM3 was Sanger sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3730\u00d7l DNA Analyzer (GATC Biotech) using a combination of eight sequencing primers (Supp. Table S4). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified by assembly to the human IFITM3 encoding reference sequence (Acc. No.: NC_000011.9) using Lasergene (DNAStar). Homozygotes were called based on high, single base peaks with high Phred quality scores, whilst heterozygotes were identified based on low, overlapping peaks of two bases with lower Phred quality scores relative to surrounding base calls (Supp. Fig. S9). We identified SNP rs12252 in our sequencing and compared the allele and genotype frequencies to allele and genotype frequencies from 1000 Genomes sequencing data from different populations (Supp. Table S3). In addition, we used the most recent release of phased 1000 Genomes data27 to impute the region surrounding SNP rs12252 to determine allele frequencies in the publicly available genotype dataset of WTCCC1 controls (n=2,938) and four previously published datasets genotyped from the Netherlands (n=8,892) and Germany (n=6,253)22.

Mutations recorded through sequencing of patients hospitalised with influenza virus during the H1N1/09 pandemic showed an overrepresentation of individuals with the C allele at SNP rs12252 (d), relative to matched Europeans. A549 cells transduced to express either full-length (IFITM3) or truncated (N\u039421) IFITM3 (e) (cell nuclei: blue, virus: green, 4\u00d7 magnification), show a reduction in viral restriction when IFITM3\u2019s N-terminal 21 amino acids are removed, relative to vector controls (Vector). Alignment of the N-termini of full length (IFITM3, top) and truncated IFITM3 (N\u039421, bottom). Values represent the mean of the percent infected cells \u00b1 s.d. (n=3).",
