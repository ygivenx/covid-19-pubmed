HFNC has proven to be a well tolerated, non-invasive respiratory support which provides a humidified and heated air-oxygen blend at a flow of 1 to 8 l/min [19, 22]. HFNC are thought to improve the ventilatory status by prevention of mucous dryness and improvement of mucous-ciliary clearance, reduction of energy expenditure for gas warming and humidification, and provision of continuous positive airway pressure, which contributes to the maintenance of patent alveoli, improves the ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, and prevents microatelectasis [6, 9, 12].",

However, there is a current lack of data on the feasibility of HFNC in infants with bronchiolitis managed on the pediatric ward and its effects on ventilation status have not been thoroughly investigated. HFNC oxygen therapy has been introduced as a standard of care at our institution for use in patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the general pediatric ward since September 2011. This decision was based on local expert consensus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of oxygen therapy administered via HFNC in infants hospitalized for moderate\u2013severe bronchiolitis in a regular pediatric ward and to assess the changes in ventilatory parameters before and after starting HFNC support.",

The size of the cannulas fitted the child\u2019s nares without occlusion. The flow rate was determined using a derived formula [27]: flow rate (in liters per minute) = weight (in kilograms) + 1, with a maximum flow rate of 8 l/min and a constant flow temperature of 37 \u00b0C. This choice was made in order to deliver a flow greater than the patient minute ventilation, so that effective fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) equals the nasal cannula oxygen concentration by preventing mixing with room air, and to minimize possible adverse events related to delivery of inadvertently too high positive end expiratory pressure for the patient. The system has an integrated pressure relief valve (manifold) at its input port to limit the maximum system pressure. This valve is set at 45-cm H2O.",

Australian investigators noted a decline in intubation rate from 37 to 7 %, with no adverse events, in a retrospective chart review over a 5-year period of 167 children with bronchiolitis treated with HFNC in the PICU [21]. Similar to our results, both studies found a reduction in respiratory rate at 60 [19] and 90 min [22] after initiation of HFNC therapy.",

Total time in oxygen, time to feed, time to discharge, and total length of stay, were similar between groups.

While the same authors express concern about the possibility that HFNC therapy with high concentrations of oxygen may provide falsely, reassuring oxygenation in sick infants who are, in fact, tiring, our study shows that HFNC offers some ventilatory support as well, as reflected by the steady decrease in ETCO2 and RR after initiation of HFNC oxygen delivery. None of our children needed escalation to other forms of respiratory support suggesting that the decrease in ETCO2 and RR may identify responders to therapy. In the study by Shibler et al. [22], responders to HFNC showed a 20 % decrease in RR within 90 min of the start of HFNC therapy, whereas non-responders showed little change in RR. ETCO2, however, was not measured.",

The principal determinants of ETCO2 are alveolar ventilation, pulmonary perfusion (cardiac output), and metabolic status [16]. The present study is the first to evaluate the effect of HFNC therapy on gas exchange by means of ETCO2 measurement in patients with bronchiolitis. Despite arterial blood gas analysis being the gold standard of monitoring partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, this is an invasive procedure and it is rarely useful at admission (or later if there is clinical improvement) for patients with bronchiolitis. It can increase stress and work of breathing of these acutely ill infants, which may in turn, worsen their respiratory status. ETCO2 has shown good correlation with capillary and arterial CO2 in both adults and children [2, 21, 26] and is especially useful for detecting trends in ventilatory status.",

The lack of a comparison group does not allow for control of confounding factors and it may be argued that other interventions (nasal suction, use of hypertonic saline, salbutamol/adrenaline) during ED stay might have influenced our findings. However, if this had been the case, improvement of ETCO2 and RR would have been expected between t-1 and t0, when children received the above mentioned interventions, as opposed to the steady ETCO2 and RR values found at these times in our study.

In contrast to nasal-CPAP which is often poorly tolerated and is impractical outside the intensive care setting [7, 8], HFNC provides a well-tolerated, easy to use and safe respiratory support, that should be considered for infants with moderate\u2013severe bronchiolitis needing oxygen supplementation, hospitalized in a pediatric ward. Despite the fact that our small sample size does not allow to properly assess the safety of this intervention on the ward, possible harm related to HFNC is rare according to the published literature. So far, only one report of a significant pneumothorax requiring intubation has been reported in a 2-month-old child who was receiving HFNC at a flow of 8 l/min for bronchiolitis [13].",
