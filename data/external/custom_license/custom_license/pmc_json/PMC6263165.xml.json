A highly coordinated immune response protects the respiratory tract from pathogens and other external insults. The role of the nervous system in regulating pulmonary host defense is not well defined. Pulmonary infections and lethal pneumonia are major public-health problems frequently causing death in children and immunocompromised and elderly people1. S. aureus is a Gram-positive human bacterial pathogen that is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, particularly respiratory-tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia1,2,3,4. The increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains necessitates nonantibiotic approaches to treatment. Targeting neuroimmunological signaling may be a novel approach to boost host immunity against lung pathogens.",

Nociceptor neurons are the subset of these neurons that respond to noxious stimuli including heat, protons, ATP, mechanical injury, inflammation, and chemical irritants8. Upon activation, nociceptors induce pain, coughing, and bronchoconstriction5,8,9,10. Recent work has shown that nociceptors cross-talk with immune cells in the respiratory tract, thereby driving allergic responses and bronchoconstriction in mouse models of asthma5,11,12.

Trpv1-Dtr mice express the human diphtheria-toxin receptor (DTR) under control of mouse TRPV1 regulatory sequences16. Mouse cells are normally resistant to diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced apoptosis but are rendered susceptible by expression of DTR. We performed daily injections of DT into 5- to 7-week old Trpv1-Dtr mice to selectively ablate TRPV1+ neurons5,16. DT treatment, compared with PBS treatment, significantly ablated TRPV1+ neurons in both the DRG and VG in Trpv1-Dtr mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). CGRP is expressed by many peptidergic C-fiber nociceptors16,17. There were significantly fewer CGRP+ neurons in DT-treated Trpv1-Dtr mice than in PBS-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, the proportion of NF-200+ neurons, which include A fibers, was higher in the DT-treated Trpv1-Dtr mice. In DT-treated compared with PBS-treated Trpv1-Dtr mice, we also observed a loss of CGRP+ nerves around the airways (Supplementary Fig. 2) and decreased noxious-heat responses in hot-plate and tail-flick assays (Supplementary Fig. 3).",

RTX is a high-affinity TRPV1 ligand that can be used to chemically denervate and ablate nociceptors15,18. Mice were subcutaneously treated with RTX at 4 weeks of age for consecutive days with escalating doses (30, 70, and 100 \u03bcg/kg) according to established protocols19,20. RTX-treated mice, compared with vehicle-treated mice, showed increased latency to noxious heat in hot-plate and tail-flick assays, and loss of TRPV1+ and CGRP+ neurons in the DRG and VG (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). At 4 weeks after RTX injection, mice were intratracheally inoculated with MRSA (0.8 \u00d7 108 to 1 \u00d7 108 CFU; Fig. 1d). Whereas most vehicle-treated mice succumbed to pneumonia (80% mortality), most RTX-treated mice survived (Fig. 1e). RTX-treated mice, compared with vehicle-treated mice, showed improved maintenance of core body temperature (Fig. 1e) and less lung bacterial burden (Fig. 1f). Trpv1-Dtr-mediated ablation and RTX treatment enhanced protection in mice infected with a sublethal dose of S. aureus (2 \u00d7 107 to 4 \u00d7 107 CFU), as measured by bacterial-load recovery (Supplementary Fig. 5). Because nociceptors may regulate the peripheral resistance of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems to infection, we measured vital signs. However, the oxygen saturation, heart rate, perfusion, and respiratory rates did not differ between RTX-treated and vehicle-treated mice at steady state; the respiratory rates also did not differ postinfection (Supplementary Fig. 6).",

Because neutrophils are critical for bacterial clearance23, we hypothesized that neuronal modulation of neutrophil recruitment might play a major role in MRSA pneumonia. We depleted neutrophils in RTX-treated mice by using low-dose anti-GR1 antibody treatment, which, compared with control IgG treatment, eliminated CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils in infected lungs (Fig. 3d). Anti-GR1 also decreased CD11b+Ly6Chi monocytes but did not affect CD11b+Ly6Clo monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 16). Neutrophil depletion in RTX-treated mice significantly increased their susceptibility to MRSA pneumonia: whereas 100% of anti-GR1-treated RTX mice succumbed to infection, 0% of the control IgG-treated RTX mice died from infection (Fig. 3e). These experimental results were confirmed in an independent cohort of mice (Supplementary Fig. 17). Neutrophils were also required for baseline protection against MRSA pneumonia (Fig. 3e).

Using intravital microscopy, we analyzed the subpleural vascular bed to assess whether neutrophil kinetics and patrolling of tissues were regulated by nociceptors. Compared with control mice, RTX-treated mice recruited significantly more neutrophils to pulmonary capillaries during early S. aureus pneumonia (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Video 1). We observed less GFP\u2013S. aureus in the lungs of nociceptor-depleted animals, in agreement with previous CFU data. Dynamic neutrophil behavioral phenotypes were analyzed for tethering, crawling, and firm adhesion within the vasculature. Tethering is a rapid, transient neutrophil interaction with the vessel wall, which requires limited cellular activation. Adhesion indicates a more advanced state of activation mediated by integrins before tissue emigration. Crawling is a complex intravascular behavior that requires upregulation of \u03b22-integrin, which occurs rapidly during lung host defense24,25. Neutrophils behaved differently during host defense in control versus RTX-treated mice. In RTX-treated mice, a significant proportion of neutrophils demonstrated vascular crawling (Fig. 4c), and tracking individual pulmonary vascular neutrophils revealed significantly greater crawling distances (Fig. 4d,e), a phenotype consistent with cellular activation and host defense against bacterial pathogens. Therefore, live imaging supports the contention that enhanced neutrophil function in the absence of nociceptors aids in the eradication of bacterial pneumonia.",

Analysis of a second transcriptional data set26 showed that Trpv1 was absent in immune cells but was highly expressed in DRG (Supplementary Fig. 18). We next purified CD4+ T cells, B cells, neutrophils, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from mouse lungs, and performed quantitative PCR analysis for Trpv1 compared with that in sensory ganglia. Whereas Trpv1 was highly expressed in the VG and DRG, it was undetectable in all lung immune cells analyzed (Supplementary Figs. 19 and 20). These data indicated that Trpv1-Dtr or RTX-mediated ablation should specifically target nociceptors but should not have direct effects on immune cells. We examined spleens of RTX-treated and vehicle-treated mice and did not observe differences in the populations of B220+ B cells, NK1.1+ cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; moreover, Trpv1-Dtr-neuron-ablated mice showed similar results (Supplementary Fig. 21).",

We found a similar increase in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in Nav1.8-Cre+/\u2212; Dta mice compared with control littermates (Supplementary Fig. 24). \u03b3\u03b4 T cells reside within epithelial layers of the lungs, skin, and gut, where they act as first responders to infection27. We next used \u03b3\u03b4 T cell\u2013deficient Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 mice to investigate the role of these cells in neuroimmunological suppression. Wild-type (WT) or Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 mice were treated with RTX to ablate TRPV1+ neurons, and then S. aureus pneumonia was induced (Fig. 5d,e). The absence of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was confirmed in Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 mice through flow cytometry (Fig. 5d). Tcrd deficiency led to a loss of protection against MRSA infection and abrogated the survival enhancement due to RTX treatment (Fig. 5e). This reversal of protective immunity correlated with an imbalance in core body temperature (Fig. 5e) and greater bacterial burdens in BALF isolated from RTX-treated Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with RTX-treated WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 26). Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 also showed defective baseline immunity against MRSA pneumonia (Fig. 5e). Whereas IL-6 levels were unaffected by Tcrd deficiency, levels of IL17A, a cytokine mediating protection against MRSA28, were significantly lower in Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 26). Neutrophil recruitment did not differ in the lungs of RTX-treated Tcrd\u2212/\u2212 mice and RTX-treated WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 26), thus suggesting that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and neutrophils are separately regulated.",

Our previous experimental approaches targeted all TRPV1+ cells, including both DRG and VG neurons. We hypothesized that vagal TRPV1+ neurons might include the subset regulating neuroimmunological suppression. To specifically target these neurons, we performed bilateral intraganglionic DT injections into the VG in 5- to 9-week-old Trpv1-Dtr mice. Immunostaining showed that vagal but not DRG TRPV1+ neurons were specifically ablated (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 28). Vagal TRPV1+ neuron ablation did not alter the heart rate, oxygen saturation, perfusion, or respiratory rate (Supplementary Fig. 6). Mice were rested 2 weeks after intraganglionic injections, then infected with a lethal dose of MRSA. We observed a striking survival benefit in vagal DT-injected Trpv1-Dtr mice compared with vagal PBS-injected mice, and better maintenance of core body temperature (Fig. 6b). All mice from the PBS-injected group died within 72 h after infection, whereas a 90% survival rate was observed among mice lacking vagal TRPV1 neurons (Fig. 6b). The greater survival in vagal DT-treated mice correlated with higher neutrophil recruitment and lower lung bacterial burdens (Supplementary Fig. 29).",

We hypothesized that CGRP might mediate neuroimmunological signaling during lethal bacterial pneumonia. We found that CGRP levels significantly increased in the BALF after S. aureus infection (Fig. 6c). Infection with an S. aureus strain mutant for agr, a key bicomponent quorum-sensing regulator of virulence-factor expression31, did not induce CGRP release into the BALF (Fig. 6c). S. aureus also directly induced cultured neuronal release of CGRP in vitro, in a manner dependent on agr (Supplementary Fig. 30). TRPV1+ cells mediated CGRP release in the lungs, because CGRP levels were significantly lower in the BALF in RTX-treated and vagal DT-treated Trpv1-Dtr mice than in control-infected mice at 12 h postinfection (Fig. 6d).

Quantitative PCR analysis showed that lung \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and neutrophils expressed Ramp1 and Calcrl, which encode the cognate CGRP receptor (Supplementary Fig. 32). We found that CGRP treatment inhibited lung-cell production of TNF-\u03b1 and CXCL1, but not IL-6, in response to MRSA infection (Fig. 6e). Increasing concentrations of CGRP also inhibited intracellular killing of S. aureus by mouse neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 33). To explore the involvement of CGRP in host defense, we treated mice with the competitive CGRP peptide antagonist CGRP8\u201337 at time points before and after S. aureus lung infection (Fig. 6f). This treatment, compared with vehicle treatment, improved survival and core-body-temperature maintenance (Fig. 6f). We next found that CGRP8\u201337 administered at time points after S. aureus infection also significantly improved survival and core-body-temperature maintenance (Fig. 6g). These data showed that nociceptors mediate CGRP release during lung infections and that postinfection blockade of CGRP signaling may aid in treatment of bacterial pneumonia.",

It is potentially advantageous that interactions between these cell types coordinate host responses to pathogen invasion. We found that TRPV1+ afferents in the VG played a critical role in modulating innate immune responses against MRSA lethal pneumonia. Targeting these neurons through Trpv1-Dtr-mediated ablation (or RTX treatment) improved survival, neutrophil and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses, and bacterial clearance. Nav1.8-cre; Dta mice, in which an overlapping though distinct nociceptor subset is targeted, showed a milder protective phenotype. Both strategies paradoxically resulted in increased bacterial dissemination. These data suggested that differences in phenotypes (lung clearance versus barrier function) are mediated by distinct neuronal subsets. A recent study has shown that Trpv1 expression in the adult DRG is mainly restricted to CGRP+ and substance P (SP)+ C fibers14. In contrast, Nav1.8 has been found to be expressed in myelinated A fibers as well as C fibers32. Another study has shown that Nav1.8-Cre; Dta mice still possess CGRP+ neurons expressing TRPV1 (ref. 21). Therefore, future experiments using more refined genetic tools should help to distinguish the functional contributions of individual TRPV1+ and/or Nav1.8+ neuronal subsets in pulmonary immunity and barrier function.",

Immune cells may utilize nerves as tracts for migration, as has been observed for dendritic-cell interactions with Nav1.8+ nociceptors in the skin20. Lung-resident immune cells may be proximal to vagal nerve afferents and may consequently able to set up local neuroimmunological responses. Recently, the neuropeptide NMU has been found to drive ILC2-mediated inflammation in the gut and lungs40,41,42. We found that nociceptors released the neuropeptide CGRP into the airways during infection and downregulated immunity. CGRP has previously been linked to vasodilation and vascular permeability43. CGRP suppresses CXCL1, an important chemokine for lung-neutrophil chemoattraction44.
