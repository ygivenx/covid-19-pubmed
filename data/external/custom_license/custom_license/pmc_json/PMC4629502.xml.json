Every year brings reports of previously unrecognized human pathogens or of pathogens extending their geographic range, becoming less susceptible to treatment or prevention, or displaying unprecedented epidemic tendencies. As I write this an unprecedented Ebola virus epidemic threatens West Africa [1] and chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus, which first appeared in the Western Hemisphere in November 2013, has already infected nearly 1,000,000 people there [2]. For those of us with responsibility for preventing or controlling infectious diseases, the speed with which new battles must be fought can be disconcerting. Zaire Ebola virus was first identified as a human pathogen only in 1977 and chikungunya in 1956 but neither reached pandemic magnitude until decades later. How can we be better prepared to identify emerging pathogens early? I will try to briefly examine some of the factors that influence our success in finding and characterizing previously unrecognized human viruses.",

By the time she was airlifted to a hospital at Johannesburg, South Africa, she had developed cerebral edema, acute respiratory distress, and renal failure.

The two men were farmers who lived approximately 100 km distant from each other in northwestern Missouri. Both men had histories of frequent tick bite and were initially suspected to be infected with Ehrlichia chaffeensis, a tick-borne rickettsia endemic to the area. Serological and molecular testing of both, however, were negative for Ehrlichia and neither responded to antibiotics. While in hospital both men developed precipitous thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Symptoms resolved with supportive care and both men were released from hospital 10 and 12 days after admission. Culture of specimens indicated the presence of virus, which was confirmed by electron microscopy, and subsequently a unique bunyavirus, in the group phlebovirus, was sequenced from both patients [8]. Phleboviruses are single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses with tripartite genomes, all of which appear to be transmitted by biting arthropods. Heartland virus is the first pathogenic phlebovirus described from the Western Hemisphere and has a 75 % nucleotide homology with the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, reported from China in 2011 [9]. Heartland virus has since been isolated from ticks and antibodies to it have been found in a variety of wild animals, including white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) [10]. There is no evidence for direct human to human transmission of Heartland although a number of mostly nosocomial cases have been reported for SFTS.",

The focus of cases has been in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and other Middle Eastern countries; the few cases detected in Europe and North Africa appear to be travelers from the Middle East. The index case was a 60-year-old male admitted to hospital at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in June 2012 with a recent history of fever, cough and shortness of breath [12]. At the time of admission his laboratory blood results were generally unexceptional but by 10 days post-admission his white blood cell count had increased to 23,800/cu mm and his platelets fallen to 78,000. Antibiotic-sensitive strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured from his respiratory tract but he did not respond to antibiotic therapy. Despite being on intensive support from the second day of admission, the patient died 11 days post-admission of respiratory deterioration and renal failure. Coronaviruses, which include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and some agents of the common cold, have positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes and are predominately transmitted between humans by fomites. Many of the MERS-CoV cases have been nosocomial or appear to have been transmitted within families. Neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV have been widely found in dromedary camels [Camelus dromedarius] from the Arabian peninsula and Africa [13] and virus has been isolated from them, strengthening the evidence that they are the immediate link to emergence in humans.",

            "text": "In a seminal study, Woolhouse et al. [14] tabulated 87 pathogens first reported to be pathogenic to humans during 1980\u20132005. Two-thirds of these were viruses, 85 % of which had single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genomes. The predominance of RNA viruses mostly owes to two characteristics. First, the rate of error during RNA replication (~ 10\u22124) is an order of magnitude greater than that of DNA (~ 10\u22125). RNA replication does not benefit from the proofreading capabilities of DNA polymerase or post-replication mismatch repair; consequently the potential for mutation per replication cycle is high [15] and the lack of fidelity may have limited the size of RNA genomes, many of which are in the range of 10,000\u201315,000 nucleotides. Second, most RNA viruses are zoonoses, that is, they were transmitted, at least initially, to humans from non-human mammal or avian hosts. Examples of RNA viruses retaining the capacity to be directly transmitted from animals to humans include influenza, Nipa, and SARS viruses, but even some viruses commonly transmitted exclusively between humans, such as HIV and hepatitis C, have likely animal origins [16]. All arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are zoonoses, although some, like dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya, have adapted to efficient vector-borne transmission between humans. Humans have been in contact with infectious animals since prehistory but their exposure accelerated with the development of livestock husbandry beginning about 15,000 years ago [17]. The growing global population has not only increased the demand for domesticated meat in the 21st C but has increased encroachment on areas once wild, both are trends that increase human exposure to animals and animal products [18].",

            "text": "The efflorescence of arbovirus discovery during 1960\u20131969 coincided with activities at tropical field research stations sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation (RF). During its investigations on yellow fever during 1916\u20131940 the RF had circumstantially discovered several novel arboviruses, including West Nile virus. In 1951 it began a 15-year program of arbovirus research in Brazil, Trinidad, Colombia, Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt and India [22]. All the field stations were located in tropical or sub-tropical countries and all carried out an integrated strategy that attempted to discover viruses from humans, vertebrate animals and biting arthropods. Of the 83 arboviruses discovered by the end of 2010, 35 (42 %) were discovered by RF staff, 23 of those during 1951-1969. In comparison, the single most successful institutional discoverer of non-arboviruses, the United States National Institutes of Health, described 12 of 130 (9 %). The RF protocol, which was the model for several other institutions, including the Institut Pasteur, was directly responsible for two additional characteristics differentiating arbovirus from non-arbovirus discovery. Although 68 % of all non-arboviruses were discovered in Europe or the USA, 67 % of all arboviruses were discovered in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, or Egypt/India/Near East (Fig. 2). Second, 33 % of arboviruses were first isolated from arthropods, a consequence of systematic vector collections. The predetermined cessation, by 1970, of most RF support for international arbovirus research\u2014including sponsorship of reference collections, conferences, new technology and reagents\u2014was soon followed by a rapid, worldwide decline in arbovirus discovery (Fig. 1b). The East African Virus Research Institute, for example, which was founded by RF in 1935, isolated 5 arboviruses after direct RF administration ended in 1952, but none after the general RF program closed in 1965.\n",

Those botanical \u201cbig hitters\u201d combined technical expertise and persistence over many years with concentration in a limited geographic area where they had gained deep knowledge. The RF was committed to a long-term strategy founded on five components. First, it chose study sites where it had evidence that arbovirus diversity would be high. These were mostly tropical and contained forested and rural areas. They chose countries where a professional work force could be recruited and where it was hoped the work would be sustained after the RF departed. Second, the program concentrated only on one subclass of pathogens, the arboviruses. Despite the wide competence of the professional staff, few reports were published dealing with local diseases other than arboviral. Third, the research strategy called for long-term commitment. RF staff, including expatriates, typically lived on site and implemented projects for years, allowing for continuity of not only research but training. Fourth, the program was integrative. Human, animal and vector investigations were simultaneously pursued. Because all scientists worked in a single unit connections between human virus isolates and those from animals or vectors were readily made. On the other hand, for many viruses isolated from animals or arthropods there has yet to be a link to human infection [24]. And fifth, each unit was self-contained. Each was capable of conducting both specimen collection and sophisticated laboratory analyses.",

Considering how few new, virulent viruses are found every year, the potential for any of 320,000 viruses jumping to humans and being discovered would then be very low (6.25 \u00d7 10\u22126). The authors used degenerate, virus-family-level primers to amplify genomic segments from specimens of feces, urine, and throat swabs collected from the bat species Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh. Amplicons were as short as 250 bp and no biological information was obtained. They found 55 viruses (and statistically surmised an additional three existed), some of which might be novel, belonging to seven virus families. In calculating a number for the universe of viruses yet to be found they speculated that each of the known 5,486 mammal species will host an average 58 unique viruses, unshared with other species. The authors concede that there is little evidence to support these presumptions. A single subtropical bat species hardly represents all mammal species and indeed many viruses are known to infect more than one species; they tested for only 9 of the 25 virus families pathogenic to humans. Ultimately, the number of viruses remaining to be discovered is irrelevant if, as expected, there are many and they continue to rapidly evolve.",

Typical human-animal contact includes husbandry, capture of wild animals for food, and exposure to animal fomites or waste, as may happen in bat infested environments. Indirect exposure via arthropods must be frequent, as evidenced by the large proportion of pathogenic viruses that are vector-borne [19]. In most instances these Tier 2, opportunistic infections are dead ends or remain rare events because the pathogen is not well adapted to transmission between humans (e.g., Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) or because the type of contact between infected animals and humans is uncommon (e.g., sealpox virus). A small but significant group of zoonotic viruses, including Rift Valley fever, Nipah and West Nile viruses, are capable of instigating human epidemics without ever adapting to human\u2013human transmission.\n",

Among the biological barriers for the virus are finding a route of entry, evading general immune defenses, invading host cells, replicating sufficient numbers before specific immune responses are mounted, and finding a route to the next host. Aerosol delivery, for example, greatly enhances transmissibility but efficiency depends on the anatomical site within the respiratory system of the invaded cells [30, 31]. Arbovirus transmission, in which the vector amplifies, transports and inoculates the virus into humans, can be enhanced by viral mutations that increase the potential for successfully infecting the vector [32, 33] or animal host [34] without altering its virulence to humans. Much recent research has focused on identifying determinants essential for viral invasion of host cells and how modification of the viral ligands might increase their ability for interspecies infectivity [34].",

In general, vertebrate specificity greatly limits the ability of viruses adapted to one species to invade similar cells in another, distant species. Influenza A is the most studied and best understood of the few viruses that frequently jump from animals to humans. A number of mutations have been identified that enhance infectivity. These include substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein receptor binding sites that enable the virus to exploit sialylated glycan receptors on respiratory cells belonging to other species [35]. For example, two non-synonymous base changes in the HA receptor binding sites of avian H2 and H3 viruses, which converted their specificity from the avian \u03b12,3-SA to human \u03b12,6-SA, led to the 1957 pandemic of H2N2 and the 1968 pandemic of H3N2 [36]. Much current research on the determinants of influenza specificity is experimental and its extension to complex natural transmission of other virus families remains to be tested. Understanding how such adaptability works could focus our attention on those virus families or species with the greatest chance of infecting humans but how this knowledge could be used more specifically to identify potential threats to humans among animal viruses, as has recently been proposed [5], is unclear.",

Pathogen species are also richer in the tropics than in temperate zones [40] although, as has been ruefully pointed out, \u201cThe fact that warbler species distributions are better understood than the distribution of human pathogens is a gap that clearly deserves research attention\u201d [41]. There is a strong association between mammal and pathogen richness but mammal diversity appears to be an indicator rather than the cause of pathogen diversity [41]. Pathogens that maintain external life cycles, for example vector-borne and helminthic, which are directly susceptible to variability in precipitation, tend to be more geographically restricted to the tropics than those directly transmissible between people, such as influenza [40]. Environmental barriers to dispersion can be circumvented. Monkeypox virus, whose natural transmission is largely restricted to parts of equatorial Africa by the range of its natural rodent hosts, has demonstrated the ability to make use of new hosts in temperate zones [42] and a number of arboviruses, such as chikungunya, dengue and Zika viruses, have widely expanded their natural ranges as their principal vectors have [43]. The RF selection of field sites in 1950 was based on the relatively greater diversity of arboviruses found during the preceding 35 years in tropical countries and it can be argued that their success in discovering new viruses owed as much to this factor as their choice of integrated, active surveillance. As would be expected, there appears to be a correlation between zones of species richness and frequency of reported vector-borne and zoonotic emerging disease events [44].",

Environmental and sanitation deficiencies also increase risk to enteric and vector-borne viruses; in the absence of dependable water supply, many people, for example, are forced to store containers of water that provide breeding for the virus-carrying mosquitoes. Most importantly, as Dunn et al.

Considering the association between mammal and pathogen species richness there can be expected to be some overlap between the two sets of \u201chot spots\u201d. The predictive robustness of a model depends not only on the algorithms used but in the choice and weighting of variables, and the representativeness and validity of the data. For example, a widely cited model [5, 44], which chooses \u201cthe original case or cluster of cases representing an infectious disease emerging (during 1940\u20132004) in human populations for the first time\u201d, lists only 61 of 168 viruses first described as infecting humans during that period [19]. On the other hand it credits the first occurrence of a number of viruses described years earlier to the period 1940\u20132004; these include measles, influenza A, and rabies, assigning to each a single, arbitrary origination location (US, Hong Kong, and Costa Rica, respectively) for modeling geospatial associations. Because this model also lumps a variety of emerging disease types, including many examples of antimicrobial resistance, population density is a major factor, which might explain the higher likelihood for emergent events it assigns to India and Java than to the Amazon or equatorial Africa, where so many novel viruses have been discovered.",

In countries with rudimentary public health systems that threshold might be reached for unexpected pathogens only after the number of cases reaches epidemic proportions impossible to ignore, as the recent epidemic of Ebola virus in West Africa demonstrates. Many viral disease cases present as clinically indistinguishable acute febrile illnesses (AFI) or with symptoms so mild the patient does not seek attention. Cases with neurological involvement or systemic bleeding can also be difficult to diagnose clinically without adequate laboratory support. In those tropical areas most likely to spawn emerging viruses, AFI will be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed in at least 50 % of patients [49\u201352]. Overlooking novel pathogens as the cause of nonspecific symptoms is not confined to developing countries: it is likely Heartland virus was a cause of illness in the USA long before it was characterized in 2012. Nevertheless, the probability that more undescribed viruses infect humans in the tropics seems to be greater. It is likely, therefore, that many emerging diseases due to novel viruses will be overlooked, especially at Tier 2, until they become epidemic, are transported to countries with more sensitive surveillance, or are discovered by chance.",

For such a plan to be feasible for emerging viruses it would be necessary to judge the potential risk posed by a virus not yet known to infect humans. Epizootic disease in livestock or wild animals is used as a threat indicator for some known zoonotic viruses, such as influenza, Rift Valley Fever virus, and West Nile virus, but there is no assurance that an agent potentially pathogenic to humans will cause noticeable disease in animal hosts. Coronaviruses closely related and putatively ancestral to SARS virus, for example, seem not to cause disease in host bats [56]. The extent of animal disease surveillance is also far less in the tropics than even the poorest human clinical networks so the likelihood of recognizing an unusual event is less. Periodic sampling of animals can discover novel viruses but is too infrequent and limited to be surveillance. Considerable attention has been given to human contact with bush meat, or animals captured for food [5]. While harvesting and slaughtering wild animals appear to have provided the mechanism by which some important pathogens have emerged, such as HIV and SARS, it has not played a role in the emergence of many others, including the three examples discussed in this paper: lujo, Heartland and MERS-CoV. Vectors obviate the need of direct human-mammal or human-bird contact and can move viruses across ecological zones. Sequencing and cataloging the viruses of animals in selected areas can provide valuable insight to transmission dynamics and phylogenetics but, as discussed, cannot yet be used to predict. One must wonder if the US $6.3 billion proposed to catalog mammalian viruses not yet known to be pernicious [26] would not be better spent on developing more suitable diagnostic tests for humans in remote areas most liable to emerging pathogen risk or on conducting sentinel human surveillance. Ultimately, the best indication that a pathogen has the ability to jump to humans is finding it in humans [57].",

Unlike investigations directed at animal populations there would be a tangible, immediate improvement in the health of the subject communities. Complimentary studies of vectors and animals, as pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, would prepare for epidemiological investigations of those zoonoses uncovered but the primary focus must be on humans.
