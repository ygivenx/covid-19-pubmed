Currently, coronaviruses are classified into four genera:\nAlphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and\nDeltacoronavirus (4).\nAmong them, six coronaviruses from the Alphacoronavirus genera and\nthe Betacoronavirus genera are known to cause human infections with\ndiverse outcomes. On the one hand, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E),5 human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63),\nhuman coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1)\npredominantly cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections (5, 6). In\nstark contrast, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused\nthe severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic between 2002 and 2003 was highly\npathogenic, which infected more than 8000 people with a fatality rate of \u223c10%\n(7, 8). Ten years later, another highly pathogenic human coronavirus, Middle\nEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in the Middle East in 2012\n(9). MERS-CoV caused severe lower\nrespiratory tract infections with an exceptionally high fatality rate of\n\u223c35%. Most importantly, despite global efforts trying to control the virus'\ndissemination, MERS-CoV still spread to over 27 countries and has been causing\ncontinuous infections in the Middle East since 2012 (10).",

            "text": "The interaction between the spike protein and its receptor is the main determinant of\nhost tropism for coronaviruses (11). Among\nthe six human coronaviruses, the Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E spike\nbinds aminopeptidase N (12), whereas the\nlineage C Betacoronavirus the MERS-CoV spike recognizes dipeptidyl\npeptidase 4 (DPP4) (13). Intriguingly, the\nAlphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 and the lineage B\nBetacoronavirus SARS-CoV both utilize angiotensin-converting\nenzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry (14, 15). However, the protein receptors for the\nlineage A Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are currently\nunknown. In addition to their designated receptors, coronavirus spikes are known to\nrecognize a broad array of cell-surface molecules, which serve to facilitate the\nattachment or entry of the viruses. For example, HCoV-NL63 and mouse hepatitis virus\nboth employ heparan sulfate proteoglycans to enhance attachment (16, 17).\nSimilarly, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, bovine coronavirus, HCoV-OC43,\nand HCoV-HKU1 bind to O-acetylated sialic acid as key attachment\nmolecules (18\u201321).\nInterestingly, in addition to utilizing O-acetylated sialic acid as\na critical binding determinant (21),\nHCoV-HKU1 spike also recognizes major histocompatibility complex class I C as\nanother attachment molecule (22). In the case\nof SARS-CoV, dendritic cell\u2013specific intercellular adhesion\nmolecule-3\u2013grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN\u2013related both\naugment virus entry (23, 24). For MERS-CoV, we previously reported\ncarcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) as an attachment\nfactor that could modulate MERS-CoV entry in permissive cells (25). More recently, tetraspanin CD9 was identified as a host\ncell- -surface factor that facilitated MERS-CoV entry by scaffolding host cell\nreceptors and proteases (26).",

To this end,\nwe aimed to investigate whether additional cell-surface molecules were involved in\nthe attachment or entry of MERS-CoV. In this study, we reported that the MERS-CoV\nspike could recognize a 78-kDa glucose\u2013regulated protein (GRP78). Although\ntraditionally regarded as an ER protein with chaperone activity, recent discoveries\nsuggest that GRP78 is also localized to the cell surface, where they carry out\nphysiological functions that regulate signaling and cellular homeostasis (27). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that\nGRP78 did not render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection but\nplayed a positive role in augmenting MERS-CoV entry in permissive cells, suggesting\nthat GRP78 is an attachment factor of MERS-CoV that can modulate MERS-CoV entry in\nthe presence of the host cell receptor DPP4. Importantly, our data further indicated\nthat the spike protein of a lineage D Betacoronavirus, bat\ncoronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9), also recognized GRP78, which played a key role in the\nattachment of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus to the bat Rousettus\nleschenaulti kidney (RLK) cells. Our findings highlight the importance\nof the possible evolution of different animal and human coronaviruses to become\ncapable of using not just the same host receptors but also the same attachment\nfactors, which may facilitate animal coronaviruses to jump the interspecies barrier\ninto human.",

As illustrated in\nFig. 2A, GRP78\nspecifically immunoprecipitated with MERS-CoV\u2013S1 (lower panel,\nlane 1) but not the control bait protein, BAP (lower panel,\nlane 2). Additionally, GRP78 was not precipitated in cells\ntransfected with the empty vector (Fig.\n2A, lower panel, lane 3). To\nconfirm the interaction between GRP78 and MERS-CoV\u2013S1, we performed\nreciprocal co-IP using GRP78 as the bait protein (Fig. 2B). In this setting, cell lysates of\nGRP78\u2013V5 or empty vector transfected BHK21 cells were immunoprecipitated\nwith anti-V5 pre-adsorbed protein A/G-Sepharose and incubated with purified\nMERS-CoV\u2013S1\u2013FLAG or BAP\u2013FLAG.

            "text": "GRP78 is a highly conserved protein that is traditionally described as an\nER-residing chaperone and plays key roles in facilitating protein folding and\nassembly as well as the regulation of ER stress (28). In recent years, multiple functions of GRP78 on the cell\nsurface have been reported, including a critical role of cell-surface GRP78 on\nvirus entry (29\u201331). Because\nour earlier data suggested that the MERS-CoV spike could interact with plasma\nmembrane GRP78, we hypothesized that GRP78 might be involved in modulating\nMERS-CoV entry or attachment. To this end, we first analyzed GRP78 expression on\nthe cell surface of human lung cell lines that are susceptible to MERS-CoV\ninfection (32, 33). As illustrated in Fig.\n3A, GRP78 was readily detected on the cell surface\nof human lung cell lines, including A549, BEAS2B, and Calu3. In addition, GRP78\nexpression was also observed on the cell surface of a broad array of human cell\nlines (AD293, Caco2, HeLa, and Huh7) and primary cells (monocyte-derived\nmacrophage (MDM), T cell) of extrapulmonary origin (Fig. 3B). Intriguingly, surface GRP78\nexpression was similarly detected in nonhuman cell lines, including BHK21, L929,\nVeroE6, and RLK. Quantitative analysis of the expression rate (Fig. 3D) and mean\nfluorescent intensity (MFI) (Fig.\n3E) from the immunolabeled cells revealed that\nsurface DPP4 and GRP78 were expressed at comparative levels in most measured\ncell lines with the exception of L929. The ubiquitous detection of GRP78 across\ncell lines from different species by the human GRP78 antibody could be\nattributed to the high degree of GRP78 sequence homology between mammalian\nspecies, suggesting that the protein is well conserved in mammalian cells (Fig. 3F). Altogether, the\nsurface expression of GRP78 on MERS-CoV\u2013susceptible cells supported the\nnotion that GRP78 might be involved in modulating MERS-CoV entry. However, the\nubiquitous expression of GRP78, particularly on cells that are not permissive to\nMERS-CoV infection, including BHK21 and L929, suggested that GRP78 might play an\nauxiliary rather than a determining role in MERS-CoV entry.",

To explore the potential\nphysiological relevance of GRP78 during MERS-CoV entry, we examined the\ndistribution of GRP78 in human lung tissues with confocal microscopy. Our\nimmunostaining results demonstrated that GRP78 was expressed at multiple regions\nof the human lung tissues. In particular, specific GRP78 expression was\nabundantly detected on the epithelial cells of the bronchus (Fig. 4A), bronchiole (Fig. 4B), and alveolus\n(Fig. 4C). Most\nimportantly, double immunostaining of DPP4 and GRP78 revealed extensive\nco-localization of DPP4 and GRP78 among the epithelial cells lining the human\nairways (Fig. 4,\nA\u2013C). The co-localization between DPP4 and GRP78 on\nthe apical side of the epithelial cells indicated the potential of GRP78 in\nfacilitating MERS-CoV entry or attachment (Fig.\n4D, arrows). Interestingly, the\nco-expression of DPP4 and GRP78 could also be recognized in extrapulmonary\ntissues, including the small intestine (Fig.\nS3A) and the kidney (Fig.\nS3B). Overall, our data demonstrated that\nGRP78 was co-expressed with DPP4 on physiologically relevant cell types in the\nhuman lung and could potentially be involved during MERS-CoV infection in the\nlower respiratory tract.",

In this set of experiments, Huh7 and BEAS2B\ncells were pre-incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GRP78 or a\nnontargeting rabbit control IgG. After the pre-incubation,\nMERS\u2013S-pseudoviruses were added to the cells for 1 h in the presence of\nthe GRP78 antibody or the control IgG. At 72 h post-inoculation, the cells were\nlysed and incubated with luciferase substrate for the quantification of\ninfectivity. Our results demonstrated that GRP78 antibody but not the control\nIgG reduced MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry in both Huh7 (Fig. 5A) and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 5B) in a dose-dependent\nmanner. In stark contrast, the entry of the control vesicular stomatitis virus\nglycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudovirus in both cell lines was not inhibited by GRP78\nantibody (Fig. 5, A and\nB). Next, we proceeded to validate the antibody blocking\nresults using infectious MERS-CoV. To this end, Huh7 cells were pre-incubated\nwith antibodies and subsequently infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of\ncontrol IgG, GRP78 antibody, or DPP4 antibody. Our data showed that the\ntreatment of GRP78 antibody similarly inhibited MERS-CoV entry in a\ndose-dependent manner (Fig.\n5C). For further verification, we infected Huh7 and\nBEAS2B cells with MERS-CoV after siRNA knockdown of GRP78 or DPP4. Western\nblotting detection demonstrated that GRP78 knockdown did not affect DPP4 or\nCEACAM5 expression (Fig.\n5D). In line with the antibody blocking results,\ndepletion of GRP78 reduced MERS-CoV entry in both Huh7 and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 5E). Because CEACAM5\nwas expressed in Huh7 but not BEAS2B cells, our data implied that the role of\nGRP78 in modulating MERS-CoV entry was independent of CEACAM5 expression. To\nfurther evaluate the role of GRP78 on MERS-CoV replication, we assessed virus\ngrowth in MERS-CoV\u2013infected BEAS2B cells after siRNA knockdown of GRP78\nor DPP4. Our data demonstrated that GRP78 depletion decreased MERS-CoV\nreplication, although to a lesser extent compared with that of DPP4 knockdown\n(Fig. 5, F and\nG). Next, we asked whether GRP78 could play a role in\nMERS-CoV entry in the physiologically relevant primary cells. To this end, we\nperformed siRNA knockdown of GRP78 (Fig.\n5H) in primary human MDM and primary human embryonic\nlung fibroblasts (HFL), which are both susceptible to MERS-CoV infection as\nreported in our previous studies (32,\n34). In agreement with our results\nfrom Huh7 and BEAS2B cells, GRP78 knockdown significantly reduced virus entry\n(Fig. 5I) and\nreplication (Fig. 5, J and\nK) in MDM and HFL. Collectively, with antibody blocking and\nsiRNA knockdown, we demonstrated a significant role of GRP78 during MERS-CoV\nentry.",

To define the functional role of GRP78 during this process, we\nchallenged AD293 or BHK21 cells with MERS-CoV after GRP78 overexpression. First,\nwe sought to evaluate the capacity of GRP78 in facilitating MERS-CoV attachment.\nTo this end, GRP78-transfected AD293 or BHK21 cells were challenged with\nMERS-CoV at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h.

Importantly, our result\ndemonstrated that the nonpermissive BHK21 cells remained refractory to MERS-CoV\ninfection despite GRP78 overexpression. In contrast, GRP78 overexpression\nfurther enhanced the entry of MERS-CoV to the permissive AD293 cells (Fig. 6, C and\nD). The effect of GRP78 on MERS-CoV entry was not due to ER\nstress (Fig.\nS4).

            "text": "Coronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor recognition system through\ntheir spike proteins. Peculiarly, the spike proteins from highly-related\ncoronaviruses can recognize different cell-surface molecules, whereas the spike\nproteins of phylogenetically distant coronaviruses can bind the same\ncell-surface molecule for attachment or entry (11). By exploring the potential interaction between GRP78 and the\nspike proteins of other coronaviruses, we unexpectedly discovered that GRP78\ncould interact with the spike protein of bat coronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9) (Fig. 8A). Interestingly,\ndespite the capacity of binding the spike proteins of lineage C (MERS-CoV) and\nlineage D (bCoV-HKU9) Betacoronavirus, GRP78 did not interact\nwith the spike protein of SARS-CoV, which is a lineage B\nBetacoronavirus (Fig.\n8B). In 2007, we reported the first discovery and\ngenome characterization of bCoV-HKU9, which was identified from Leschenault's\nrousette bats (R. leschenaulti) (44). Recently, with structural analysis and surface plasmon\nresonance assay, it appeared that the receptor-binding domain of bCoV-HKU9 spike\nwas incapable of reacting with either human DPP4 or ACE2 (45). In this regard, it would be important to explore the\npotential physiological relevance of the interaction between GRP78 and bCoV-HKU9\nspike. We first evaluated the cell tropism of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus with\nMERS\u2013S-pseudovirus included as a control. Remarkably, our data suggested\nthat among the 10 evaluated mammalian cell lines, HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus\nentry was most pronounced in R. leschenaulti kidney (RLK) cells\n(Fig. 8C). Notably,\nalthough MERS\u2013S-pseudovirus entry was evident in RLK cells, culture for\nbCoV-HKU9 in RLK or other cell lines has not been successful (44). In line with the pseudovirus entry\nresult, the surface-binding efficiency of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus on RLK cells\nwas \u223c3-fold that on Caco2 cells (Fig.\n8D), which is a human colon cell line known to be\npermissive for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection. Notably, overexpression of\nhuman GRP78 in the apparently nonpermissive L929 and BHK21 cells did not render\nthe cells permissive to HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus entry, indicating that GRP78\ncould not function as an independent receptor for bCoV-HKU9 (Fig. 8E). In contrast, with\na flow cytometry-based surface-binding assay, we demonstrated that the GRP78\nantibody (Fig. 8G) but not\nthe control IgG (Fig. 8F)\nreduced the binding of HKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus to the cell surface of RLK\ncells in a dose-dependent manner, which was evidenced by the drop in the\npercentage of HKU9\u2013S-positive cells (Fig.\n8H) as well as the decrease in the\nHKU9\u2013S-mean fluorescent intensity (Fig.\n8I). Taken together, our data identified GRP78 as an\nimportant cell surface\u2013binding protein for both MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9 by\nserving as an attachment factor.",

GRP78 was expressed\non the surface of MERS-CoV\u2013susceptible cell lines of pulmonary and\nextrapulmonary origin (Fig. 3). At the same\ntime, immunostaining of human lung tissues identified abundant co-expression of DPP4\nand GRP78 in the epithelial cells along the human airways (Fig. 4). Next, with antibody blocking and siRNA knockdown\nexperiments, our data indicated the involvement of GRP78 in MERS-CoV entry (Fig. 5). Overexpression assays of GRP78 in\nMERS-CoV\u2013permissive and MERS-CoV\u2013nonpermissive cells unambiguously\ndemonstrated that GRP78 did not independently render nonpermissive cells susceptible\nto MERS-CoV infection but could facilitate MERS-CoV entry in conjunction with DPP4\nby serving as an attachment factor (Fig. 6).\nIntriguingly, GRP78 was up-regulated upon MERS-CoV infection, which might further\nfacilitate virus attachment among the infected cells (Fig. 7). Most importantly, GRP78 was also recognized by the spike\nprotein of a bat Betacoronavirus, bCoV-HKU9. Our result further\nindicated that GRP78 was not the functional receptor of bCoV-HKU9 but could modulate\nHKU9\u2013S-pseudovirus attachment to RLK cells (Fig. 8).

It is involved in a wide\nrange of physiological processes, including protein folding and assembly,\ntranslocation of newly synthesized polypeptides, degradation of misfolded proteins,\nas well as maintaining the ER homeostasis (27). In addition, GRP78 is an essential regulator of ER stress due to its\ncritical role in the unfolded protein response pathway. Despite its participation in\nER-related functions, GRP78 is also detected in other cellular fractions, including\nmitochondria, nucleus, cytosol, and plasma membrane (43). In recent years, an increasing number of studies have described the\nphysiological role of cell-surface GRP78 during virus entry. For instance, GRP78 was\nidentified as a co-receptor for coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9) (30) and dengue virus (47). In addition, cell-surface GRP78 also facilitates the entry of Japanese\nencephalitis virus (29). Here, we reported\nGRP78 as a host factor that could serve as an attachment protein for two\nBetacoronaviruses, MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9. In its capacity as\nan attachment factor, GRP78 may serve to concentrate virus particles on the cell\nsurface, which may then increase the possibility of receptor-mediated virus entry\nfor MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9.

We have previously reported the identification of CEACAM5 as an\nattachment factor of MERS-CoV, which could facilitate MERS-CoV entry in the presence\nof DPP4 (25). Recently, CD9 was reported as a\nhost factor that could augment MERS-CoV entry by bringing the cellular receptor and\nproteases into close proximity, thus increasing the infection efficiency (26). In this study, the identification of GRP78\nas an attachment factor of MERS-CoV further indicated that the spike protein of\nMERS-CoV is highly efficient in engaging multiple cell surface factors to facilitate\nvirus entry. In contrast to CEACAM5, which is expressed on limited cell types (25), surface GRP78 expression appeared to be\nrelatively abundant across various cell types of different tissue origin (Fig. 3). In addition, a remarkable level of GRP78\nwas specifically detected on the epithelial cells along the human airways, where it\nwas found to colocalize with DPP4 (Fig. 4). In\nthis regard, it is tempting to speculate that the capacity of the MERS-CoV spike to\nutilize multiple host surface proteins, including CEACAM5, CD9, and GRP78, may give\nMERS-CoV a physiological advantage in establishing efficient infections, which may\ncontribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus.",

The virus was first identified in 2007 in a\nterritory-wide molecular surveillance study on bat samples from the Guangdong\nprovince of Southern China (44). Subsequent\nstudies suggested that the virus was widely distributed and was circulating in\ndifferent bat species (48\u201351). Structural and functional features of the receptor-binding domain\n(RBD) of bCoV-HKU9 demonstrated that the spike protein of the virus was incapable of\ninteracting with either DPP4 or ACE2 (45).\nHowever, the RBD of bCoV-HKU9 contained a conserved core structure that was shared\nacross other Betacoronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and\nbat coronavirus HKU4 (bCoV-HKU4) (45).\nNotably, recent reports demonstrated that bCoV-HKU4 could recognize human DPP4 as a\nfunctional receptor, indicating the potential of bat coronaviruses in human\nadaptations. In this regard, the identification of GRP78 as a shared attachment\nfactor for MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9 is interesting but alarming, which highlighted the\nimportance of continuous surveillance on the other members of the\nBetacoronavirus genus for their capacity of interspecies\ntransmission.",

The human\nAlphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 may be a recombinant between\nNL63-like viruses in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses\ncirculating in Hipposideros bats (52). Another human Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E has\nclosely-related 229E-like coronaviruses recently isolated from dromedary camels\n(53). Similarly, the lineage A\nBetacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 was postulated to originate from a\nbovine coronavirus and jumped into human in the 1890s (2, 54). The lineage B\nBetacoronavirus, SARS-CoV, originated from either civets or\nbats, which jumped into human in 2003 (55,\n56), whereas the lineage C\nBetacoronavirus, MERS-CoV, is likely to have jumped from camels\ninto human in 2012 (57, 58). Because three (lineages A, B, and C) out of four lineages\nof animal Betacoronaviruses have independently jumped from animal\ninto human in the recent past, there is enough reason to suspect that a lineage D\nBetacoronavirus may also jump into human one day. Our finding\nof the lineage C MERS-CoV and lineage D bCoV-HKU9 sharing the same host attachment\nfactor GRP78 highlights the importance of monitoring the evolution of bCoV-HKU9,\nwhich may jump the interspecies barrier into human leading to another major epidemic\nin the future.",
