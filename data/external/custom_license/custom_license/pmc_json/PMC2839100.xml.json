There were various detection rates of FHV-1 according to the breeding sites, the countries and the cats' clinical status. The prevalence of FHV-1 was ranged from 0 to 52% for clinically normal cats of a breeding cattery or shelter in Sweden [6], the USA [2,11,15] and European countries [5]. The prevalence of FHV-1 for client-owned normal cats was 5.9% [10] and this was 12% [15] in the USA. The percentage of cats with diseases at a breeding cattery or shelter in European countries [5] and the USA [1] ranged from 0 to 41%. For client-owned abnormal cats, FHV-1 was detected in 4.5% to 76.3% of the cats in Japan [3,9], the USA [2,3,10,15], Australia [16] and Italy [12]. Based on these findings, the FHV-1 positive rates of the shelter cats were generally higher than those of the client owned-cats or the breeding cattery cats. Especially, many shelter cats without diseases had a higher prevalence than did the clinically abnormal client-owned cats. We think that the results are due to that many shelter cats have been infected with FHV-1 and they remain subclinical carriers after recovery. At least 80% of infected cats remain latently infected and 29% of them shed virus spontaneously [4]. Thus, FHV-1 has been frequently detected in latently infected cats that are without clinical signs. Also, those cats that live in a colony like an animal shelter, an animal hospital and a multi-cat household can be more frequently exposed to FHV-1.",

The first is the difference in the frequency and level of stressful events that cats are exposed to in an animal shelter. Stress as simple as moving a cat into a new environment can convert a latent infection to an active infection in a few days [11]. Virus shedding continues for 1-2 weeks around 1 week after a stressful event [6]. Thus, in this study, cats may have the greatest risk of infection through more exposure to reactivated virus from carriers because the Korean housing environment may be more stressful than that in other countries. The second reason is there is a high shedding rate for incoming cats at the time of first entry to the shelter. However, in other study, the shedding rate was much lower than the rate after 1 week in the shelter [11]. To certify this possibility, it will be necessary to investigate the proportion of cats that already shed FHV-1 at the time they are relinquished.",

According to these previous reports, clinically normal cats had a much lower prevalence of C. felis than that of abnormal cats. Unlike FHV-1, those cats in a shelter or a breeding cattery had a low detection rate of C. felis. These results indicate that the clinical signs of URTD or ocular disease are correlated with infection of C. felis and they are not related to the housing environment. C. felis was not detected in our study.",

FCV was rarely detected in two studies that focused on clinically normal cats (1% in Japan and 2.6% in Sweden) [6,9]. One previous study even showed that FCV was not detected from clinically abnormal cats in some shelters [1]. In our present study, FCV was not detected at all. This result may be due to several reasons. First is a possibility that all the examined cats were not truly infected with FCV. The second possible reason is that the chronic infected cats were not shedding virus. Last, it has been reported that the lower detection rate of FCV is due to some problems for detecting virus on in the feline mucosal swabs, that is, the very small number of virus particles, the presence of RNase in the mucosa and the FCV's genetic variability [16]. We can not exactly determine how these factors contribute to a low detection rate.",

These cats would be sources of infection after returning to society. Thus, proper management by veterinarians, cleaning protocols, a low stress environment and proper cage design are necessary in an animal shelter. Especially, it may be important to make a less stressful environment through decreasing the extent of crowding. Although vaccination with FHV-1 and FCV cannot lead to prevention of infection and viral shedding, this may reduce the overall severity of disease [16].
