At baseline, we invited 677 adults to participate; 503 (74.3%) consented and completed the survey (Technical Appendix Table 1). We measured the following variables: knowledge about the modes of pH1N1 virus transmission; risk perceptions associated with the virus (perceived susceptibility to and severity of infection); perceived efficacy and use of preventive measures (e.g., handwashing, using a facemask); psychological responses (worry about infection and emotional distress); and evaluations of the government\u2019s performance in pandemic control. Sample sizes for surveys 2\u20137 ranged from 452 to 481, yielding retention rates of 89.8%\u201395.6%.",

We aimed to determine whether there were overall linear trends in participants\u2019 perceptions, psychological responses, and behavioral responses to the pandemic. We examined linear trends for these variables across the 7 time points by using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models. GEE models not only account for intracorrelated repeated measures data but also fit various data types using appropriate link functions. The analyses were conducted using PROC GENMOD (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA); 2-sided p<0.05 was considered significant.",

Knowledge regarding preventive measures and adherence to such measures was, in general, higher among our participants than among the general population in other countries (e.g., Australia, India, and the Netherlands) (9\u201311). The prevalence of misconceptions about some incorrect modes of transmission (e.g., insect bites) gradually declined. However, \u224850% of participants still held at least 1 of the 4 misconceptions regarding transmission (i.e., airborne transmission over a long distance and transmission through insect bites, water sources, and well-cooked pork). Furthermore, over time, a lower percentage of participants avoided touching their eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent virus transmission. A 2015 systematic review suggested that health authorities should provide more updated information about the virus (8). We also recommend using health campaigns to increase public awareness about different routes of pH1N1 virus transmission.",

However, an increasing proportion of participants believed that, compared with seasonal influenza, pH1N1 resulted in more deaths and more severe body damage. Perceived susceptibility to infection declined substantially as the epidemic progressed, suggesting that the public gradually perceived fewer risks from pH1N1 virus. Avoidance behaviors and use of facemasks in the absence of influenza-like symptoms became less prevalent over time, similar to a trend seen in Malaysia (12). Mental distress among persons in Hong Kong was lower during the pH1N1 pandemic than during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic (13), possibly due to the milder consequences of pH1N1 infection. Persons in Hong Kong seemed to remain rational during the pandemic, thereby avoiding possible pandemic-associated economic threats.",
