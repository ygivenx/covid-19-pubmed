The existing network of traditional surveillance efforts managed by health ministries, public health institutes, multinational agencies, and laboratory and institutional networks has wide gaps in geographic coverage and often suffers from poor and sometimes suppressed information flow across national borders [4]. At the same time, an enormous amount of valuable information about infectious diseases is found in Web-accessible information sources such as discussion sites, disease reporting networks, and news outlets [5,6,7]. These resources can support situational awareness by providing current, highly local information about outbreaks, even from areas relatively invisible to traditional global public health efforts [8]. These data are plagued by a number of potential hazards that must be studied in depth, including false reports (mis- or disinformation) and reporting bias. Yet these data hold tremendous potential to initiate epidemiologic follow-up studies and provide complementary epidemic intelligence context to traditional surveillance sources. This potential is already being realized, as a majority of outbreak verifications currently conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are triggered by reports from these nontraditional sources [5,6].",

Through low-cost and real-time Internet data-mining, combined with openly available and user-friendly technologies, both participation in and access to global disease surveillance are no longer limited to the public health community [14,15]. The availability of Web-based news media provides an alternative public health information source in under-resourced areas. However, the myriad diverse sources of infectious disease information across the Web are not structured or organized; public health officials, nongovernmental organizations, and concerned citizens must routinely search and synthesize a continually growing number of disparate sources in order to use this information. With the aim of creating an integrated global view of emerging infections based not only on traditional public health datasets but rather on all available information sources, we developed HealthMap, a freely accessible, automated electronic information system for organizing data on outbreaks according to geography, time, and infectious disease agent [16] (Figure 1).",

Internet search criteria include disease names (scientific and common), symptoms, keywords, and phrases. The system collects an average of 300 reports per day, with the majority acquired from news media sources (85.1%). Although most of the reports collected to date have been in English, HealthMap also monitors information sources in Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and French, with additional languages such as Hindi, Portuguese, and Arabic under development.

While local news sources may report on incidents involving a few cases that would not be picked up at the national level, such sources may be less reliable, lacking resources and training, and may report stories without adequate confirmation. Furthermore, other biases may be intentionally introduced for political reasons through disinformation campaigns (false positives) or state censorship of information relating to outbreaks (false negatives). We have attempted to better understand some of these issues through ongoing analysis and evaluation research. We ran a 43-week evaluation of HealthMap data, covering the period of October 1, 2006 through July 18 2007. We found that pathogen diversity was substantial across news sources, with 141 unique infectious disease categories reported through the Google News feed alone (Table 1). We found the frequency of reports about particular pathogens to be related not to their associated morbidity or mortality impact, but rather to the direct or potential economic and social disruption caused by the outbreak.",

Overwhelming public health officials with information on outbreaks of low public health impact may distract them from investigating outbreaks of greater priority that might receive reduced media attention. Thus, only articles classified as breaking news are posted to the site. Although they are filtered from the initial display, other article types and duplicate articles are shown in a related information window, providing a situational report on an ongoing outbreak as well as recent reports concerning either the same disease or location, and links for further research (Figure 4).",

As false alarms can often be reduced by thorough aggregation and cross-validation of reported information, a composite activity score (or heat index) is calculated based on (a) the reliability of the data source (for instance, increased weight is given to WHO reports and reduced weight to local media reports); and (b) the number of unique data sources, with increased weight to multiple types of information (e.g., discussion sites and media reports on the same outbreak). This meta-alert derivation is based on the idea that multiple sources of information about an incident provide greater confidence in the reliability of the report than any one source alone.",

Monitoring other Internet-based sources such as blogs, discussion sites, and listservs could complement news coverage. The use of click-stream data and individual search queries is also a promising new surveillance source [24]. Multilingual surveillance is critical for capturing greater geographic coverage and for providing earlier and more comprehensive reporting from local news media.",

While Internet-based online media sources are becoming a critical tool for global infectious disease surveillance, important challenges still need to be addressed. Since regions with the least advanced communication infrastructure also tend to carry the greatest infectious disease burden and risk, system development must be aimed at closing the gaps in these critical areas. Hence, achieving global coverage requires attention to creating and capturing locally feasible channels of communication. It also involves making the outputs of the system more accessible to users in these regions through user interfaces in additional languages and low-bandwidth display options, including mobile phone alerts.",
