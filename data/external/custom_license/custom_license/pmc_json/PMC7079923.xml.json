            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus from the Coronaviradae family, mainly infects swine enterocytes and causes intestinal atrophy, dehydration, and diarrhea in pigs (Chasey and Cartwright 1978; Huang et al. 2013). Generally, PEDV is considered as a food-borne and water-borne pathogen and mainly transmitted through the fecal\u2013oral route. However, recent studies showed that PEDV can also be transmitted through the air (Alvarez et al. 2016; Beam et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018). Even though PEDV has been found in pig herds for more than 40 years, it did not cause severe outbreaks and significant economic losses previously. However, new PEDV variant strains with extremely high virulence to piglets had reemerged in pig farms of China since late 2011 (Li et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2012) and had been found in the Americas, the European Union, and Asian countries since then. The reemerged PEDV strains caused up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets younger than 1 week due to the high virulence of these variants and the lack of a mature immune system in piglets (Stevenson et al. 2013).",

Among them, the N protein packages the PEDV genomic RNA into a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and plays a fundamental role during virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and membrane protein M (Egberink et al. 1988). It also plays an important role in enhancing the efficiency of subgenomic viral RNA transcription as well as viral replication (Egberink et al. 1988). Additionally, N protein is highly conserved between different PEDV strains (Song and Park 2012). Therefore, the N protein can be used as a target for early detection of PEDV infection and evaluation of immunization efficacy raised by PEDV live vaccine.",

When the serum antibody level against PEDV-N protein reached the platform phase, the mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were isolated and fused with SP2/0 cells. Cell culture medium was measured by ELISA to screen the antibody-secreting hybridoma cells. The cells in positive wells were subjected to three-round subcloning with limited dilution strategy. Eventually, six mAb-secreting hybridoma strains were obtained and named 2D3, 3F12, 4A3, 5F3, 5F6, and 7G3 respectively. These six hybridoma cell strains were subsequently injected into mouse peritoneal cavity to produce mAbs in the ascites. The isotype of prepared mAbs was then analyzed by SBA Clonotyping System. The results demonstrated that the heavy chains of all six prepared mAbs against PEDV-N were IgG1 (Fig. 2a) while all the light chains were \u03ba a chain (Fig. 2b). The antibody titer of the collected ascites was titrated by indirect ELISA with a series of dilutions. The results showed that most mAbs prepared in this study can be used in 1:16,000 dilution and the 2D3 can be diluted at least 4000-fold (Fig. 2b).

Currently, cumulative mutations of virulent PEDV strains have led to the change of their antigenicity, resulting in a decrease or failure in the efficacy of the vaccines which originated from the classical strain CV777 (Song et al. 2015). Additionally, PEDV is often coinfected with some other diarrheal viruses (Zhang et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2016). Meanwhile, the clinical symptoms between the PEDV and other porcine diarrheal viruses share a high similarity (Lin et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016).

            "text": "The N protein is an ideal target for early detection of PEDV or other coronavirus infections due to the following features and functions (Li et al. 2005; Totura and Baric 2012). Firstly, the N protein is a phosphorylated protein that binds stably to the viral RNA to form a nucleocapsid of the helical structure, which is involved in the transcription and translation of the viral genome, thereby affecting the replication of the virus (Hiscox et al. 2001; Saif 1993; Yang et al. 2013; You et al. 2005). In addition, the N protein interacts with the M protein to form budding vesicles, which is involved in the release process of the virus. The PEDV-N protein was reported to inhibit the production of type I interferon and activate the NF-\u03baB pathway to escape the host\u2019s antiviral immunity (Ding et al. 2014). What\u2019s more, the N protein can be transported between nucleoli and cells via nuclear export signals (NES) using the CRM1-dependent pathway (Shi et al. 2014). More importantly, the N protein is highly conserved between PEDV strains (Li et al. 2013; Song et al. 2015). We selected some nucleoproteins of representative viral strains from different swine coronaviruses to compare their homologies with our PEDV strain LJX01/2014. The results showed that all the homologies of nucleoprotein between selected coronaviruses and PEDV LJX01/2014 are less than 44% (Supplementary Table S3). In addition, we analyzed the nucleoprotein homologies between PEDV LJX.01/2014 and other representative PEDV strains (classical or virulent) isolated from different countries and years. The results demonstrated that their nucleoprotein homologies between selected PEDV strains and LJX01/2014 are above 97% (Supplementary Table S4). These results indicated that nucleoprotein is highly conserved within PEDV strains while varying between different genuses of coronavirus. As a result, the PEDV-N protein can be used as a candidate for early detection of PEDV infection in vivo and in vitro.",

Among these six mAbs, 3F12 recognizes a linear epitope (VAAVKDALKSLGI) while the other five mAbs recognize different conformational epitopes formed by a specific peptide fragment or the full length of N protein. Xie et al. recently reported two N-terminal epitopes located within residues 58\u201385 had cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV (Xie et al. 2019). However, all six mAbs prepared in this study recognized the epitopes located between residues 201\u2013379 of PEDV nucleoprotein. Therefore, the mAbs we generated might be specific to PEDV infection. The functional analysis indicated that all six mAbs were applicable to ELISA, western blot, IFA, and flow cytometry assay. In addition, the PEDV-neutralizing activity of these six mAbs was determined by antibody neutralization assay. Unfortunately, none of these six mAbs can neutralize PEDV, which was different from the neutralization effect obtained from the antibodies originating from PEDV-S protein (Li et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2017; Okda et al. 2017).",
