In naturally infected camels, MERS-CoV RNA has been recovered most commonly from nasal swabs but also from fecal swabs, rectal swabs, and lung tissue (20,24). No evidence of viral RNA has been demonstrated in camel serum, blood, or urine using rRT-PCR (25,26). In experimentally infected camels, infectious virus and RNA was detected in nasal swab and oral samples but not in blood, serum, feces, or urine (23). MERS-CoV RNA has been detected in raw camel milk collected using traditional milking methods, including using a suckling calf as stimulus for milk letdown; presence of live virus was not evaluated (27). Virus RNA may therefore have been introduced via calf saliva or nasal secretions or fecal contamination. Experimentally introduced virus can survive in milk but did not survive when heat treated (28). It is also not known if the virus would remain viable in milk from seropositive dams when antibodies could be found in the milk.",

Contact with nasal secretions can occur when directly handling live camels, and virus from camel nasal secretions can contaminate fomites in the environment (29). Although rRT-PCR evidence of MERS-CoV and genome fragments have been detected in air samples from a camel barn (30), no live virus was detected, and no epidemiologic study has implicated airborne transmission. Transmission following exposure to camel feces may be biologically plausible, although no epidemiologic evidence indicates the likelihood of such transmission. Similarly, although transmission following consumption of raw camel milk may be biologically plausible, epidemiologic studies have not consistently identified milk consumption as a unique risk factor for MERS-CoV infection or illness, independent of other direct or indirect camel exposures (31,32). No epidemiologic evidence supports transmission associated with camel urine or meat.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV RNA is detected most frequently in younger camels (22,25,33) but has been detected in camels >4 years of age (22). In a longitudinal study of a camel dairy herd, most calves became infected with MERS-CoV at 5\u20136 months of age, around the time maternal MERS-CoV antibodies wane. The calves then produced MERS-CoV antibodies by 11\u201312 months of age (34). In seroprevalence studies, camels <2 years of age demonstrated lower seroprevalence than camels >2 years of age (25,35). Across many countries, the seroprevalence of adult camels is >90% (16,17). Overall, these data suggest most camels are initially infected with MERS-CoV at <2 years of age. However, camels can shed virus despite preexisting MERS-CoV antibodies, suggesting that repeat infections are possible (36,37). Varying prevalence of MERS-CoV RNA in camels has been reported in different countries and settings, such as farms (33) and live animal markets (38). Risk for camel-to-camel or camel-to-human transmission may be influenced by crowding, mixing of camels from multiple sources, transportation, and characteristics of live animal markets (39). Phylogenetic modeling has provided supportive evidence that long-term MERS-CoV evolution has occurred exclusively in camels, with humans acting as a transient and usually terminal host (40).",

In Qatar, a study of 9 seropositive and 43 matched seronegative camel workers showed that regular involvement in training and herding of camels, cleaning farm equipment, not handwashing before and after camel handling, and milking camels were associated with seropositivity (46). In a Saudi Arabia study of 30 camel workers in which 50% were seropositive for MERS-CoV, no association was identified between seropositivity and factors including age, smoking, handwashing after camel contact, consuming camel meat or milk, or specific occupation (camel truck driver, handler, or herder) (47). Neither investigation controlled for possible confounding risk factors (e.g., age or duration of exposure to camels). In Abu Dhabi, an investigation of 235 market and slaughterhouse workers showed that 17% were seropositive for MERS-CoV and that daily contact with camels or their waste, working as a camel salesman, and self-reported diabetes were risk factors for seropositivity (32). Among market workers in the same study, handling live camels and either cleaning equipment (e.g., halters, water troughs, etc.) or administering medications to camels were risk factors on multivariable analysis (32). These studies generally support the hypothesis that direct physical contact with camels is a risk factor for transmission, although cleaning equipment could also result in indirect transmission.",

In Nigeria, no MERS-CoV antibodies were found in 261 slaughterhouse workers with exposure to camels (Appendix reference 52). MERS-CoV sequences from camels in Africa phylogenetically cluster separately relative to camel and human MERS-CoV from the Arabian Peninsula, suggesting single or few introductions into Saudi Arabia and limited contact (19). Differences in virus growth have been shown between MERS-CoV strains isolated from West Africa and those isolated from the Middle East (19); relative to human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso and Nigeria had lower virus replication competence in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. These findings may suggest regional variation in the potential for MERS-CoV replication in humans. Other factors contributing to the limited evidence of zoonotic MERS transmission in Africa may include differences between virus surveillance, human populations, camel populations, camel husbandry, and the type of human\u2013camel interactions in these regions.",

More severely ill patients typically have higher MERS-CoV RNA levels, as indicated by rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and more prolonged viral shedding (Appendix reference 64). MERS-CoV RNA has been detected from the lower respiratory tract >1 month after illness onset (Appendix references 65,66), and live virus has been isolated up to 25 days after symptom onset (Appendix reference 67). RNA detection is prolonged in the respiratory tract of patients with diabetes mellitus, even when adjusting for illness severity (Appendix reference 66). Among mildly ill patients, who might typically be isolated at home, viral RNA levels in the upper respiratory tract have been detected for several weeks (Appendix references 68,69). Infectious virus has been isolated from the upper respiratory tract of a patient with mild symptoms (Appendix reference 68), suggesting a potential for transmission among less severely ill patients.

However, implementing triage procedures to quickly identify potential MERS cases in areas with local MERS-CoV transmission (e.g., Arabian Peninsula) is challenging because signs and symptoms are often nonspecific (Appendix reference 83).

In these areas, close contact with camels (e.g., handling or training) is an identified risk factor for infection. Direct or indirect contact with nasal secretions probably plays a role. Given limited knowl\u00adedge of mechanisms of MERS-CoV transmission, current precautions to prevent zoonotic transmission, such as recommendations to avoid consumption of raw cam\u00adel milk and meat, are prudent despite the lack of epidemiologic evidence linking these exposures to MERS-CoV infec\u00adtion. Such precautionary recommendations, while appropriate in the context of limited knowledge, should not be interpreted as evidence of an epidemiologic association with MERS-CoV transmission.",

Specifically, contact with respiratory secretions, whether through direct contact or through aerosolization of secretions during aerosol-generating procedures, plays a role in transmission. Virus isolation from fomites suggests the potential for alternative mechanisms of transmission, but direct epidemiologic evidence is lacking. Although MERS-CoV has been isolated from a mildly ill case-patient, available evidence is not sufficient to conclusively state that asymptomatic patients play an appreciable role in MERS-CoV transmission. Given the knowledge gaps surrounding transmission from asymptomatic patients, WHO recommendations state \u201cuntil more is known, asymptomatic RT-PCR positive persons should be isolated, followed up daily for development of any symptoms, and tested at least weekly\u2014or earlier, if symptoms develop\u2014for MERS-CoV\u201d (Appendix reference 90).
