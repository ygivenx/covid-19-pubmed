Recent findings suggest that HBoV may establish persistent infection of mucosal lymphocytes or contribute to tonsillar hyperplasia in children (2). In previous reports, we described prolonged HBoV DNA detection in immunocompromised children (3,4). Partial sequencing of the VP1 gene of HBoV from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and sphenoid sinus samples showed 100% identity, which suggested persistence of the same HBoV strain over a 5-month period (3). It remains speculative, however, whether paranasal sinus mucosa represents a site of HBoV persistence. To clarify this, we analyzed samples of paranasal mucosal tissue and nasal polyps from patients with chronic sinusitis for respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria.",

To provide evidence that the QIAGEN RNeasy kit is also suitable for DNA extraction, we spiked HBoV negative samples with different amounts of HBoV DNA before extraction of nucleic acids was done with either the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit or DNA Blood Kit (QIAGEN). Extracted nucleic acids were then subjected to real-time PCR by using primers specific for HBoV. Minimal differences (\u00b11 cycle threshold [Ct] value) in the HBoV PCR were detected; the QIAGEN RNeasy Kit was therefore used throughout the study (data not shown). Nasal swabs and ETDA-blood were purified by using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN). Multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses (Fast-track Diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxembourg) was conducted to detect influenza A (including pandemic [H1N1] 2009) and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus; human metapneumovirus; HBoV; parainfluenza virus 1\u20134; human coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43; human rhinoviruses; human enteroviruses and parechoviruses; and adenoviruses.

HBoV was detected in specimens collected during July\u2013September (13/18) and during February and March (5/18). All positive results were confirmed by single real-time PCR (9). For 14 patients, 2 different mucosal samples were tested and gave identical results. No multiple viral infections and no bacteria were detected. Median patient age was 51.2 years (range 14.4\u201374.2 years) for HBoV-positive and 47.6 years (range 13.3\u201388.1 years) for HBoV-negative samples.

Moreover, the fact that no HBoV DNA was detected in nasal swabs or EDTA-blood samples indicates no active HBoV infection. In previous studies, HBoV DNA was frequently identified in the adenoids and tonsils of children (2,5,10). However, in contrast with our findings, detection of HBoV was mostly associated with other viruses, suggesting that co-virus\u2013induced cellular damage might contribute to bocavirus reactivation and replication (5). Our findings indicate that persistence of viral nucleic acid in sinus mucosa might be a special advantage of HBoV, although the relevance of this observation remains unclear. Whether this presence as a single virus means a dead end for HBoV infection, true latency including the potential of reactivation, or a role in the pathogenesis of clinical conditions requiring surgery warrants future studies.",
