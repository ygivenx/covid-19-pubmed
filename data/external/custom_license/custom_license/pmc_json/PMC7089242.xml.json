Questions have been raised about diminished social obligations as government involvement appear to have receded in the face of international economic integration (Rodrik 1997). Studies about the impact of economic globalisation have generally focused on the relevance of the nation\u2013state (Strange 1996) as well as local industry and enterprises in an increasingly integrated world. Cultural globalisation has equally been of concern in terms of its homogenising influence on lifestyles and consumption patterns particularly among the young (Fellman et al. 2003; Watson 1997). Indeed, tensions generated by conflicts between local identities and the cultural changes influenced by cultural globalisation appear as an inevitable outcome in countries seeking closer integration with the world economy (Keohane and Nye 2001; Meyer et al. 1997).",

            "text": "Globalisation implies the multiplicity of linkages and interconnections between the states and societies that make up the modern world system. It describes the process by which events, decisions and activities in one part of the world can come to have significant consequences for individuals and communities in quite distant parts of the globe. Globalisation has two distinct dimensions: scope (or stretching) and intensity (or deepening) (McGrew 1992, p. 23). Indeed, the concept of \u2018time\u2013space compression\u2019 advanced by Harvey (1989) has been cited regularly in accounts of how physical distance has been replaced with speed distance. In other words, globalisation highlights the need for responses to address the speed at which activities, information and influences can reach across the globe. There has been, relatively speaking, a neglect in the consideration of the need for institutional changes and responses particularly in the health sector with globalisation. Attention however, has been focused on environmental concerns such as the shifting of environmental stresses to developing countries with economic globalisation (Sachs 1999). Contemporary threats, both environmental and health-related, do not appear to respect borders as SARS illustrated amply. The analysis of the way in which Singapore institutions managed ultimately to organise its fight against SARS suggests the failure of both institutions and institutional processes particularly in their response to the implications and outcomes of economic globalisation. While the crisis was addressed, \u2018... The public service rallied together, putting aside turf rivalries, for a prompt and comprehensive SARS response. ... mistakes were made. Like the failure to enforce infection-control measures at all hospitals, which allowed the virus to spread. ... errors in judgement ... Like the failure to isolate some SARS cases early enough\u2019 (Chua 2004, p. 21). Some 74.8% of the cases in Singapore were infected in hospitals and nursing homes (Teo et al. 2005).",

Vulnerability was an issue because the readiness of health institutions and personnel was not a matter being given special attention. In particular, there has been little attention paid to the establishment of a system of institutional processes to help hospitals and health personnel respond collectively to the threat of the emerging infection diseases that have been seen increasingly in different parts of the world today. In the following discussion, the evidence of the rapid spread of the disease highlights the lack of preparedness among the local health institutions in relatively globalised cities such as Singapore, to face a global health threat. This was particularly in terms of information networking and sharing nationally and regionally. There was however, greater success in the action taken by the national government to respond to the containment and then isolation of the disease once it was identified and its nature better communicated and understood. In many ways, the highly centralised regime of governance in Singapore helped to put in place public health measures that resulted in the containment of the disease including infection control procedures in key health institutions.",

SARS is considered a global health threat and has wreaked havoc in what the world has known as countries with highly efficient institutions as well as health care delivery systems that were equally well-regarded. Singapore was one of these countries where health care institutions and personnel were caught off-guard by a global outbreak that they did not appear prepared to take on at the time SARS struck in 2003.",

These pigs further infected human pig-handlers in the process (Chua et al. 2000; Lam and Chua 2002) including at least one such human handler in Singapore. Transmission of the disease was facilitated by poor farming practices. The emergence of the nipah virus was considered to have been induced by humans and human actions particularly in habitat degradation.",

These comprise agricultural development and urbanisation involving massive land clearance as well as deforestation, population migration, biodiversity loss and habitat fragmentation, air and water pollution, climatic changes and hydrological alterations, such as the building of dams (Patz and Confalonieri 2004). \u2018Multiple factors, including economic development and land use, human demographics and behaviour, and international travel and commerce, contribute to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases\u2019 (Fauci 2005, p. 1079; Morse 1995). In the case of SARS, there is particular concern with the growth of the market in wildlife trade. Such trade results in disease-carrying hosts in wild game markets that abound in cities, such as Guangdong in China. This implies increased exposure of human handlers and consumers to animal reservoirs of novel micro-organisms. These markets are, in addition, a tourist attraction with large numbers of international and domestic visitors brought in daily to tour them. While in the past, such wild game markets have been small in scale and localised in terms of the clientele, there has been rapidly growing demand resulting in the development of regional networks and an increase in wildlife hunting (Bell et al. 2004).",

Failure of the institutional practices in the health care delivery system was one of the factors that would have led to the rapid transmission of the diseases or at least the failure at arresting and containing the spread of the infectious disease. Another factor that is a regional concern is the lack of an information network among health care as well as public health institutions that are located in globalising cities that are increasingly integrated in the world system of international travel and other business connections. Indeed, there have been allegations of cover up and unwillingness to share information among China\u2019s authorities that in turn affected the way in which the disease was managed in cities such as Hong Kong and countries including Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore.",

The implication was that 1 week\u2019s delay in the implementation of infection control measures could triple the size of the epidemic and increase its duration to 4 weeks (Tai 2006; Wallinga and Teunis 2004). There appears to be a gap that needs to be addressed between the speed at which economies are globalising and the state of preparedness of their institutions for such global integration. Certainly, the health care delivery system in Singapore was highly vulnerable, from the point of view of preparedness, to the onslaught of rapid infection and fatality that the SARS virus brought. It took authorities one week between the death from SARS of a worker from a wholesale market and the closure of the market as well as the start of contact tracing to ensure that all who had been in contact with the worker would be quarantined (Chua 2004). http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table/en/index.html (Access on 26 March 2007).",

In the case of a large number of European countries, 100% of the cases were imported, hence implying that the transmission among the locals was contained. In Singapore, the overwhelmingly large proportion of cases resulted from local transmission. While it is noted that the infectiousness of SARS has not been uniform, the discussion is about the lack of infection control measures to contain its spread among locals. In many instances, the transmission was among cases that had been hospitalised. Fatalities included medical doctors and nursing staff. The pattern was similar to that of most East Asian countries beginning with China and including cities like Hong Kong. Taiwan too was equally struck. Here, the challenge to the implementation of quarantine procedures was evident: health workers threatened to jump out of hospital windows, thereby defying their quarantine orders.

Nevertheless the decision to close schools had to be taken in the end, in part to allay fears of further infections by children who might have travelled abroad with their families during the holidays. The state of unpreparedness of the hospitals to face the challenges posed by SARS was seen in the toll on hospital patients who were being treated for other complaints including serious illnesses such as cancer. The Singapore General Hospital SARS debrief report noted that \u2018There were many victims of the SARS crisis in Singapore who never had SARS at all who were just sick patients who didn\u2019t get the care that they needed due to the many constraints that came along with the SARS crisis and all the attendant measures needed to combat the outbreak\u2019 (Chua 2004, p. 67).",

One of these geographical zones encompasses the sources or original starting points for SARS in Guangdung in southern China with high potential for species transfer of the virus. This is the zone with a potential for the re-emergence of the disease. Other zones comprise the countries and cities affected because of import through travellers from the potential zone of re-emergence of SARS. Indeed, the links between these two types of geographical zones identify a territorial swathe connected through business and tourism as well as migration.

In a rather macabre twist, a number of the hotels served as quarantine centres for staff of a mental health institute where another fever cluster had been identified during the original SARS outbreak. While it proved to be a false alarm, it was a decision taken to quarantine health workers of the institute in hotels because the institute itself had no facilities to accommodate the staff.
