            "text": "Seventeen years have passed since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nin 2003, but there is yet no approved treatment for infections with the SARS coronavirus\n(SARS-CoV).1 One of the reasons is that, despite the devastating\nconsequences of SARS for the affected patients, the development of an antiviral drug against\nthis virus would not be commercially viable in view of the fact that the virus has been\nrapidly contained and did not reappear since 2004. As a result, we were empty-handed when\nthe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a close relative of SARS-CoV,\nemerged in 2012.2 MERS is characterized by severe respiratory disease,\nquite similar to SARS, but in addition, frequently causes renal failure.3\nAlthough the number of registered MERS cases is low (2494 as of November 30, 2019; www.who.int), the threat MERS-CoV poses to global public\nhealth may be even more serious than that presented by SARS-CoV. This is related to the high\ncase-fatality rate (about 35%, compared to 10% for SARS) and to the fact that MERS cases are\nstill accumulating seven years after the discovery of the virus, whereas the SARS outbreak\nwas essentially contained within 6 months. The potential for human-to-human transmission of\nMERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, where 186\ncases could be traced back to a single infected traveler returning from the Middle\nEast.4 SARS-like coronaviruses are still circulating in bats in\nChina,5\u22128 from where they may spill over into the human population; this is\nprobably what caused the current outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, which is linked to\na seafood and animal market. The RNA genome (GenBank accession code: MN908947.3; http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319, last\naccessed on January 11, 2020) of the new betacoronavirus features around 82% identity to\nthat of SARS-CoV.",

A possible solution to the problem\ncould be the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that are directed against the\nmajor viral protease, a target that is shared by all coronavirus genera as well as, in a\nrelated form, by members of the large genus Enterovirus in the picornavirus\nfamily. Among the members of the genus Alphacoronavirus are the human\ncoronaviruses (HCoV) NL63 (ref (9)) and 229E10 that usually cause only mild respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy\nindividuals, but are much more widespread than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Therapeutic\nintervention against alphacoronaviruses is indicated in cases of accompanying diseases such\nas cystic fibrosis11 or leukemia,12 or certain other\nunderlying medical conditions.13 The enteroviruses include pathogens such\nas EV-D68, the causative agent of the 2014 outbreak of the \u201csummer flu\u201d in the\nU.S.,14 EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), the etiological agents\nof hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD),15 Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3),\nwhich can cause myocardic inflammation,16 and human rhinoviruses (HRV),\nnotoriously known to lead to the common cold but also capable of causing exacerbations of\nasthma and COPD.17 Infection with some of these viruses can lead to\nserious outcomes; thus, EV-D68 can cause polio-like disease,18 and EV-A71\ninfection can proceed to aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, viral\nmyocarditis, and acute flaccid paralysis.15,19,20 Enteroviruses cause clinical disease\nmuch more frequently than coronaviruses so that an antiviral drug targeting both virus\nfamilies should be commercially viable.",

            "text": "However, enteroviruses are very different from coronaviruses. While both of them have a\nsingle-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, that of enteroviruses is very small (just\n7\u20139 kb), whereas coronaviruses feature the largest RNA genome known to date\n(27\u201334 kb). Enteroviruses are small, naked particles, whereas coronaviruses are much\nlarger and enveloped. Nevertheless, a related feature shared by these two groups of viruses\nis their type of major protease,21 which in the enteroviruses is encoded\nby the 3C region of the genome (hence the protease is designated 3Cpro). In\ncoronaviruses, nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (Mpro).\nSimilar to the enteroviral 3Cpro, it is a cysteine protease in the vast majority\nof cases and has, therefore, also been called a \u20333C-like protease\u201d\n(3CLpro). The first crystal structure of a CoV Mpro or\n3CLpro (ref (22)) revealed that two of\nthe three domains of the enzyme together resemble the chymotrypsin-like fold of the\nenteroviral 3Cpro, but there is an additional \u03b1-helical domain that is\ninvolved in the dimerization of the protease (Figure 1A). This dimerization is essential for the catalytic activity of the CoV\nMpro, whereas the enteroviral 3Cpro (Figure 1B) functions as a monomer. Further, the enteroviral 3Cpro\nfeatures a classical Cys\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Glu/Asp catalytic triad,\nwhereas the CoV Mpro only has a Cys\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His dyad.22 Yet, there are a number of common features shared between the two types of proteases, in\nparticular their almost absolute requirement for Gln in the P1 position of the substrate and\nspace for only small amino-acid residues such as Gly, Ala, or Ser in the P1\u2032\nposition, encouraging us to explore the coronaviral Mpro and the enteroviral\n3Cpro as a common target for the design of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds.\nThe fact that there is no known human protease with a specificity for Gln at the cleavage\nsite of the substrate increases the attractiveness of this viral target, as there is hope\nthat the inhibitors to be developed will not show toxicity versus the host cell. Indeed,\nneither the enterovirus 3Cpro inhibitor rupintrivir, which was developed as a\ntreatment of the common cold caused by HRV, nor the peptide aldehyde inhibitor of the\ncoronavirus Mpro that was recently demonstrated to lead to complete recovery of\ncats from the normally fatal infection with Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV)\nshowed any toxic effects on humans or cats, respectively.23,24",

In Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV, the performance of this\ncompound was excellent, with EC50 = 0.0004 \u03bcM, and even against HCoV 229E\nin Huh7 cells and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, EC50 values of 1.8 and 2.1\n\u03bcM, respectively, were observed (Table 3).\nAlso, in enterovirus-infected cell cultures, the compound performed well, with\nEC50 values of 0.7 \u03bcM or below against HRV2, HRV14, and EV-D68 in HeLa\n(Rh) cells and selectivity values > 15. The only concern is the activity of the\ncompound against EV-A71 in RD cells, for which the EC50 value was 3.7 \u03bcM,\nresulting in too low a therapeutic index. On the other hand, only weak toxicity was\ndetected for 11r in Vero or Huh-T7 cells. Preliminary pharmacokinetics tests\nwith the compound in mice did not indicate a toxicity problem (to be published\nelsewhere).",

Through crystallographic analyses of a total of\nsix inhibitor complexes of three different proteases in this study, we found the\n\u03b1-ketoamide warhead\n(\u2013CO\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013)\nto be sterically more versatile than other warheads such as Michael acceptors\n(\u2013CH=CH\u2013CO\u2013)\nand aldehydes (\u2013CH=O) because\nit features two acceptors for hydrogen bonds from the protein, namely, the \u03b1-keto\noxygen and the amide oxygen, whereas the other warheads have only one such acceptor. In the\nvarious complexes, the hydroxy group (or oxyanion) of the thiohemiketal that is formed by\nthe nucleophilic attack of the active-site cysteine residue onto the \u03b1-keto carbon can\naccept one or two hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. In\naddition, the amide oxygen of the inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His\nside chain. Alternatively, the thiohemiketal can interact with the catalytic His residue and\nthe amide oxygen with the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. Depending on the exact\ninteraction, the stereochemistry at the thiohemiketal C atom would be different. We have\npreviously observed a similar difference in the case of aldehyde inhibitors, where the\nsingle interaction point, the oxyanion of the thiohemiacetal, can accept a hydrogen bond\neither from the oxyanion hole or from the catalytic His side chain,37\nresulting in different stereochemistry of the thiohemiacetal carbon. Both \u03b1-ketoamides\nand aldehydes react reversibly with the catalytic nucleophile of proteases, whereas Michael\nacceptors form irreversible adducts.",

In nearly all studies aiming at discovering\npeptidomimetic inhibitors of coronavirus Mpros, P2 is invariably isobutyl\n(leucine), and this residue has also been used in the efforts to design compounds that would\ninhibit enterovirus 3Cpros as well (see above).

Accordingly, the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV\nMpro is the most tolerant among the three enzymes investigated here, in terms\nof versatility of the P2 substituents accepted.",

The latter\ncompound exhibits very good inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV Mpro as well\nas the enterovirus 3Cpro, and its performance in the SARS-CoV and enterovirus\nreplicons is convincing. Being in the low micromolar range (EV-A71, CVB3), the data for the\nantiviral activity in cell cultures for 11r correlate well with the inhibitory\npower of the compound against the recombinant proteases as well as in the replicon-based\nassays. This is not true, though, for the surprisingly good in cellulo\nactivity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells. Also, the correlation does not\nseem to hold for LLC-MK2 and CaCo2 cells. We tested the antiviral activity of many of our\ncompounds against HCoV NL63 in these two cell types and found that all of them had low or\nsubmicromolar EC50 values against this virus in LLC-MK2 cells but were largely\ninactive in CaCo2 cells (not shown).

Whereas the inhibitor exhibits excellent activity against MERS-CoV\nwhen Huh7 cells are the host cells (400 pM), the inhibitory activity is weaker by a factor\nof up to 12,500 when Vero cells are used (EC50 = 5 \u03bcM). On the other hand,\n11r exhibits excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity in human Calu3 lung cells,\ni.e., in the primary target cells, where the compound will have to act in a therapeutic\nsetting (A. Kupke, personal communication). As we tested antiviral activity against SARS-CoV\nexclusively in Vero cells, the EC50 values determined for our compounds against\nthis virus are in the one-digit micromolar range or higher; the best is again compound\n11r with EC50 = 2.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, the relatively weaker\nactivity (or even inactivity) of our inhibitors against RNA viruses in Vero cells was\nobserved independently in the virology laboratories in Leuven and in Leiden. It is thus\nunlikely that the lack of activity in Vero cells is related to problems with the\nexperimental setup. In preliminary experiments, we replaced the P3 cinnamoyl group of\n11r by the fluorophor coumaryl and found by fluorescence microscopy that much\nmore inhibitor appeared to accumulate in Huh7 cells compared to Vero cells (D.L., R.H. and\nIrina Majoul, unpublished).",

Hydrogen bonds are depicted as blue dashed\nlines. The inset at the top of the images shows the stereochemistry of the\nthiohemiketal formed by the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys residue onto the\n\u03b1-keto group. (A) Binding of 11a to SARS-CoV Mpro. The\nthiohemiketal is in the R configuration, with its oxygen accepting\ntwo hydrogen bonds from the oxyanion-hole amides of Gly143 and Cys145. The amide\noxygen accepts an H-bond from His41. The side chains of Ser144 and Arg188 have been\nomitted for clarity. (B) The P2-benzyl substituent of 11a cannot fully\nenter the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 Mpro, which is much smaller and has\nless plasticity than the corresponding pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro (cf. A). The\nbenzyl, therefore, binds above the pocket in the view shown here; this is probably the\nreason for the total inactivity (IC50 > 50 \u03bcM) of compound\n11a against HCoV-NL63 Mpro. The small size of the pocket is\ndue to the replacement of the flexible Gln189 of the SARS-CoV Mpro by the\nmore rigid Pro189 in this enzyme. The stereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is\nR. The side chains of Ala143 and Gln188 have been omitted for\nclarity. (C) Binding of 11a to the CVB3 3Cpro. The\nstereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is S, as the group accepts a\nhydrogen bond from His41, whereas the amide keto group accepts three H-bonds from the\noxyanion hole (residues 145\u2013147). The side chain of Gln146 has been omitted for\nclarity. (D) The crystal structure of 11f in complex with HCoV-NL63\nMpro shows that this short (inactive) compound lacking a P3 residue has\nits P2-Boc group inserted into the S2 pocket of the protease. The stereochemistry of\nthe thiohemiketal is S. The side chains of Ala143 and Gln188 have\nbeen omitted for clarity. (E) In contrast to P2 = benzyl in 11a, the\nisobutyl group of 11n is small and flexible enough to enter into the\nnarrow S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 Mpro. The thiohemiketal is in the\nR configuration. The side chains of Ala143 and Gln188 have been\nomitted for clarity. (F) In spite of its small size, the cyclopropylmethyl side chain\nin the P2 position of 11s can tightly bind to the S2 subsite of the\nSARS-CoV Mpro, as this pocket exhibits pronounced plasticity due to the\nconformational flexibility of Gln189 (see also Figure 4). The stereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is\nS. The side chains of Ser144 and Arg188 have been omitted for\nclarity.",

The main differences here concern the main chain\naround Gln189 (note the flip of the 189\u2013190 peptide bond) as well as the side\nchain of this flexible residue, the conformational change of which allows the S2\npocket to \u201cshrink\u201d and adapt to the small size of the P2 substituent in\n11s.
