The discovery\nof these anti-HIV peptides spurred the identification of antiviral\npeptides against other viruses that utilize class I fusion proteins,\nincluding the recently identified MERS-CoV. After the emergence of\nMERS-CoV infection, Gao\u2019s group and Jiang\u2019s group independently\nsolved the crystal structure of MERS-CoV\u2019s 6HB fusion core.13,19 On the basis of the 6HB structure, Jiang\u2019s group reported\nthe highly effective anti-MERS-CoV peptide HR2PM2. Most recently,\nwe identified a hydrocarbon-stapled short \u03b1-helical peptide\nthat could inhibit MERS-CoV infection at the low micromolar level.20 Considering the universal 6HB fusion mechanism\nemployed by class I enveloped viruses, inhibition of NHR/CHR coiled\ncoil-mediated interactions has significant potential for the development\nof broad-spectrum therapeutic interventions.",

            "text": "Initially, we aimed to establish combinations\nof foregrounda-d residues in the heptad repeat\nmoiety. As previous experiments have indicated that alanine residues\nare strongly biased toward helix formation in peptides,38 the design of the novel lipopeptide began with\nthe peptide named AAS (Table 1), in which hydrophobic alanine residues were placed at the a and d positions of the heptad, and a\nsmall helix-favoring polar residue, i.e., serine, which has been widely\nutilized in protein functional scanning strategies,39 was populated at the e positions. To explore\nthe influence of hydrophobic residue contact at \u03b1-helix-mediated\ncoiled-coil interaction sites on antiviral activity, substitutions\nat the a-d positions of the peptide\nAAS were made with different hydrophobic residues, including Val,\nPhe, Tyr, Leu, and Ile. We used our previously developed MERS-CoV\nS protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion assay to test the biological\nactivity of these peptides.40 As shown\nin Table 1, all of\nthe lipopeptides potently inhibited cell\u2013cell fusion mediated\nby MERS-CoV S protein, with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 0.1 to >10.0 \u03bcM. Of the six lipopeptides\nwe designed, both LLS and IIS were found to be potent MERS-CoV fusion\ninhibitors, with EC50 values of 0.24 and 0.10 \u03bcM,\nrespectively. The possible reasons for this activity include the evolutionary\npreference for Leu and Ile in the heptad positions a-d for viral fusion glycoprotein sequences and the\nsignificance of creating enough hydrophobicity/amphiphilicity to yield\na stable coiled-coil structure.41 Compared\nto LLS, IIS possessed obviously lower cytotoxicity in Huh-7 cells,\nwhich were used as target cells in the cell\u2013cell fusion assay.\nTherefore, in the next round of analogues, we further mutated residues\nat the e position of the heptad of IIS with different\ntypes of polar residues, including cationic Lys, anionic Glu, and\nuncharged Gln, as well as aromatic/heterocyclic amino acids such as\nTyr, Trp, and His, expecting that these optimizations would provide\nfurther improvement in potency and cytotoxicity. Strikingly, Gln-containing\nIIQ and Tyr-containing IIY had EC50 values of 0.11 and\n0.52 \u03bcM, respectively, even reaching the potencies of the MERS-CoV-specific\nfusion inhibitor HR2PM2 peptide.42 In addition,\nboth IIQ and IIY possessed lower cytotoxicity values than the selected\nlead IIS, with a 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50)\nvalue of >100 \u03bcM. Subsequently, we tested the inhibitory\nactivity\nof the peptide IIQ on the entry of pseudovirus carrying the wild-type\nMERS-CoV S protein. As shown in Supporting Information, Figure S1, IIQ was effective against MERS-CoV\npseudovirus infection, with an EC50 value of 0.13 \u03bcM;\nthis finding was in close agreement with the cell\u2013cell fusion\nassay results. These data imply that the de novo designed peptides\nthat are nonhomologous with the naturally occurring MERS-CoV S protein\nsequence could effectively inhibit MERS-CoV infection by targeting\nvirus\u2013host cell membrane fusion. Moreover, we explored the\nstructural properties of these lipopeptides by circular dichroism\n(CD) spectroscopy to determine if their propensities to adopt \u03b1-helical\nstructure were correlated with anti-MERS-CoV activity. The relationships\nbetween the EC50s of lipopeptides and their \u03b1-helical\ncontent are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting\nInformation. We found that the potency was not strictly dependent\non their \u03b1-helicity (r2 = 0.2439),\nsuggesting that other factors, such as solubility and target binding\naffinity and kinetics, may be involved in their biological activity.\nThis phenomena has also been observed in the studies on HIV-1 fusion\ninhibitors, where several C-peptides exhibited no anti-HIV-1 potency\ndespite they have fully \u03b1-helical structure in solution.29,43",

            "text": "The ongoing threat of the emergence\nof resistant variants that\ndiminish or ablate the effectiveness of the currently available anti-IAV\ndrugs underscores the demand for new antiviral strategies targeting\nother proteins in the influenza virus life cycle.44 Therefore, we employed a cytopathic effect inhibition assay\nto evaluate the inhibition effect of compounds IIS, IIY, and IIQ,\nwhich exhibited promising potency in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection,\nagainst IAVs. Surprisingly, one of the lipopeptides, IIQ, displayed\npotent inhibitory activity toward both strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34\n(H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2), with EC50 values of\n1.73 and 0.70 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 2). Furthermore, none of these peptides displayed\na cytotoxic effect against Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK)\ncells at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. The selective index of\nIIQ was larger than 143, indicating a safe profile for further exploration.\nThe data presented in Table S1 in the Supporting\nInformation show that IIQ was also potent against oseltamivir-resistant\nstrains, including LN/1109 (H1N1) and TJ/15 (H1N1), with EC50 values of 4.36 and 3.03 \u03bcM, respectively, whereas oseltamivir\nwas much less effective (EC50 = 21.7 \u03bcM) against\nLN/1109 (H1N1) and inactive against TJ/15 (H1N1) at concentrations\nup to 100 \u03bcM. In addition, IIQ also exerted remarkable inhibitory\nactivity against B/Lee/40 strain infection with an EC50 value of 1.87 \u00b1 0.95 \u03bcM. As expected, MERS-CoV HR2PM2\ndisplayed no inhibition effect against A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and\nA/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) infection at the concentration up to 20 \u03bcM.\nThe life cycle of influenza virus is divided into three steps, i.e.,\nvirus entry, viral genome replication, and progeny virion release.45 Currently, several anti-influenza drugs have\nbeen developed for interruption of specific processes in influenza\ninfection. Among them, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) targets neuraminidase\n(NA) protein, thus preventing release of tethered progeny virus from\nits host cells.46 Favipiravir that selectively\ninhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been approved in Japan as\nan inhibitor of influenza virus replication for the treatment of influenza\nvirus infection in 2014.47 We then asked\nif the IIQ peptide acts by inhibiting the entry step of IAV into host\ncells. To address this question, a viral replicon assay and a neuraminidase\ninhibition assay were performed to rule out any effect of IIQ on viral\nreplication and progeny virion release, respectively. In the mini-replicon\nsystem, viral RNA polymerase protein expression plasmids mediate the\nexpression of a reporter genome encoding firefly luciferase. Through\ndetermination of the normalized firefly luminescence/Renilla luminescence ratio, we found that favipiravir\ncould inhibit influenza replicon activity in a dose-dependent manner,\nwith a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 26.2\n\u00b1 3.7 \u03bcM, whereas IIQ and the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir\nexhibited no significant inhibition at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM\n(Figure 2A). As shown\nin Figure 2B,C, neither\nIIQ nor favipiravir was able to disturb cleavage of the substrate\nby neuraminidase from the two IAV strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)\nand A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) in the test range. In contrast, oseltamivir\ncould inhibit neuraminidase of these two viruses, with IC50 values of 1.71 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 nM, respectively.\nTaken together, these results suggest IIQ may affect the entry stage\nof viral life cycle to block virus infection. Moreover, using a time-of-addition\nassay, we found that the viral load at intervals of 0\u201310 h\n(covering the whole life cycle) and 0\u20132 h (covering the entry\nstep) was reduced by approximately 60%, with the addition of 10 \u03bcM\nIIQ, as compared with the PBS control, and no antiviral activity was\nobserved for the remaining three time intervals (2\u20135, 5\u20138,\nand 8\u201310 h). However, favipiravir continued to exert its full\neffect, even at the interval of 5\u20138 h. These results further\nconfirmed that IIQ targets the entry step in the IAV life cycle (Figure 2D\u2013F). Hemagglutination\ninhibition (HI) assay is well-established to determine whether the\nsialic acid-binding site on HA1 subunit acts as potential drug target;\nmeanwhile, hemolysis inhibition assay is commonly used to determine\nwhether the HA2 subunit can be a possible target.48 Thus, an HI assay was first performed to determine the\npotential effect of IIQ peptide on the HA1 subunit sialic acid-binding\nsite. The result showed that no apparent inhibition of influenza virus-induced\naggregation of chicken erythrocytes was observed in the test range,\nindicating IIQ has no effect on the interaction of HA1 subunit with\nits sialic acid receptor (Supporting Information, Figure S3A). Moreover, the hemolysis inhibition assay showed\nthat the lysis of erythrocytes caused by the conformational rearrangements\nof HA2 subunit under acidic condition was decreased compared with\nthe hemolytic effect of virus only (Supporting Information, Figure S3B). The combined results indicate that\nIIQ may bind to the HA2 subunit to interrupt the conformational changes\nin HA2 rather than interacting with HA1 subunit via inhibiting the\nabsorption of viruses into host cells, consistent with our design\nrationale.",

The first piece of evidence came from\nnative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) of equimolar mixtures\nof IIQ plus synthetic peptides containing the NHR segments of the\nMERS-CoV spike (S) protein S2 subunit, designated as HR1P,13 and the postfusion structure of the H3N2 hemagglutinin\n(HA) HA2 subunit, namely N66,49 respectively.\nThe mixtures of IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 showed new bands at the upper\npositions in the gel, demonstrating that tightly associated complexes\nwere formed (Figure 3A). These findings are consistent with the results obtained from\ncircular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, in which the signal of these\nmixtures was dramatically greater than that of the mathematical sum\nof the corresponding isolated peptides, suggesting induction of a\nlarge \u03b1-helical structure resulting from their interaction (Figure 3B,C).50 Moreover, data from CD analysis indicated that\nthe IIQ/HR1P and IIQ/N66 helical bundles showed strong thermal stability,\nwith melting temperature values of >90 and 83.1 \u00b0C, respectively\n(Figure 3D and Supporting\nInformation, Table S2). In CD analysis,\nN36/C34 6HB,31 which has an available crystal\nstructure and is widely used to represent the HIV-1 fusion core, was\nused as a positive control (Supporting Information, Figure S4). Finally, sedimentation velocity analysis demonstrated\nthe heterogeneous 6HB states of the IIQ/HR1P complex and the IIQ/N66\ncomplex (Supporting Information, Table S3 and Figure S5). Together, these data\nsuggest that the active IIQ peptide does indeed associate with a site\nin the NHR region and forms heterogeneous 6HB structures that interfere\nwith the fusion between virus and target cell membrane.",

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), methanol, piperidine, and\nother reagents used in the reaction process were anhydrous reagents\nor dried prior to use. The synthetic steps were as follows: (1) The\nresin was first swelled in a reaction vessel by the addition of 5\nmL of DMF and 5 mL of DCM, followed by stirring for 20 min. (2) The\nFmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine/DMF. The deprotection\nreaction was performed twice; the first reaction was 5 min, and the\nsecond reaction was 2 min. (3) The next amino acid was coupled with\nthe addition of 5 mL of amino acid solution (0.25 M), 5 mL of condensing\nreagents [0.2 M O-benzotriazole-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU)/DMF\nand 0.2 M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)/DMF], and 5 mL of active base\nsolution [0.4 M N,N-diisopropylethylamine\n(DIEA)/DMF] to the reactor; the reaction was stirred at room temperature\nfor 60 min. After completion of the coupling reaction or Fmoc removal,\nthe resin was washed with DMF (5 \u00d7 1 min) and DCM (3 \u00d7 1\nmin). For lipopeptides, the template peptides containing a Dde-protected\nlysine residue at their C-terminus required a special deprotection\nstep (four 3 min washes of 2% hydrazinehydrate in DMF). This enabled\nthe conjugation of a palmityl moiety, which was performed by the addition\nof 3 equiv of palmic acid, 3 equiv of HBTU, and 6 equiv of DIEA in\nDMF to the resin, followed by stirring for 2 h. Conjugation of a fluoride\n[4-fluoro-7- nitrobenzofurazan (NBD)] fluorescent probe to the N-terminus\nof the peptide was performed by the addition of 6 equiv of NBD-Cl\ndissolved in DMF together with 6 equiv of DIEA to the peptide resin,\nfollowed by stirring for 12 h. The peptides were cleaved from the\nresin and deprotected with reagent K, which contained 85% trifluoroacetic\nacid, 5% thioanisole, 5% m-cresol, and 5% water.\nThe carboxyl termini were amidated upon cleavage from the resin, and\nthe amino termini were capped with acetic acid anhydride, except NBD-conjugated\npeptides. All lyophilized crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; Shimadzu preparative\nHPLC system), and the purity of each peptide was confirmed to be \u226595%\nby analytical RP-HPLC (Shimadzu analytical HPLC system).
