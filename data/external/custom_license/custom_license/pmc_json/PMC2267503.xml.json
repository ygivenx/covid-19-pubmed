            "text": "Live-attenuated vaccines are powerful weapons for combating human viral diseases, and a number of them are in routine use. Live vaccines provoke both local and systematic immune responses. Both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in stimulating humoral and cell-mediated responses (Levine et al. 2004). The widespread administration of the Sabin 1, 2, and 3 vaccine strains of poliovirus (PV) has brought PV to the brink of global eradication. The Sabin strains are safe and easy to manipulate experimentally, and their low cost makes their production and distribution affordable, which is a particularly important concern in developing countries. Because of these factors, the Sabin PV strains are ideal vaccine vectors for foreign antigen expression.",

            "text": "Various strategies have been employed to modify Sabin viruses into versatile vaccine vectors. Small epitopes can be conjugated to one of the neutralizing domains of the capsid proteins (Burke et al. 1989; Dedieu et al. 1992), but the usefulness of this hybrid virion strategy is greatly decreased by restrictions on the size of the attached epitope (normally < 25 amino acids). Another strategy, in which one of the structural protein genes is replaced with the foreign gene (Bledsoe et al. 2000; Novak et al. 1999), results in recombinant viruses that are defective in replication and require a helper virus to provide the necessary structural protein. In the most frequently adopted strategy, polyprotein fusion, the foreign antigen is fused at either the N-terminus of the polyprotein or at the junction between the capsid proteins and the nonstructural proteins in the PV polyprotein, along with an artificial protease site. Thus, after co-translation with the viral polyprotein, the foreign antigen is easily removed by one of the endogenous proteases and is released into the cytoplasm (Andino et al. 1994; Mattion et al. 1995).",

RNA was transcribed on a large scale from a linearized plasmid template in the presence of T7 polymerase. The recombinant virus was generated by introducing the infectious RNA into a permissive cell line. However, the transcripts prepared by this method possessed two non-native 5\u2032-terminal G nucleotides that had no effect on minus-strand synthesis but caused plus-strand RNA synthesis to decrease to an undetectable level (Barton et al. 2002; Morasco et al. 2003). Also, the precise 5\u2032 end has been shown to be essential for efficient plus-strand RNA synthesis (Herold and Andino 2000).",

The M2 extracellular domain (M2e) is the most promising target for a universal vaccine against type A influenza virus (Fiers et al. 2004 and references therein). Because this 24-amino-acid peptide is not very immunogenic, we fused its gene to that of CTB, a well recognized immune adjuvant (Gonzalea et al. 1993), and inserted the hybrid gene into the PV vector to further boost the immunogenicity of M2e, taking advantage of the ability of live vaccine to stimulate the full immune response in the human body.",

The RBD consists of multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes that induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. Rabbits and mice immunized with SARS-RBD produced high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV with a 50% neutralizing titer of 1:10,000 (He et al. 2004; He et al. 2005). Since RBD sequences are relatively highly conserved, recombinant RBD or vectors encoding RBD may be used as safe and efficacious vaccines for preventing infection by SARS-CoVs of various genotypes (Jiang et al. 2005 and references therein).",

Although the value of the oral live PV vaccines (Sabin vaccines types 1, 2, and 3) is widely recognized, these vaccines do have an inherent risk; even though the likelihood is very low, the attenuated live virus can revert to the neurovirulent phenotype. Indeed, a very small number of cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) have occurred in recipients of oral PV vaccine (Melnick 1984). Experimental evidence strongly suggests that most of these cases are caused by Sabin vaccines types 2 and 3 (Kew et al 1981; Minor 1982). In an enquiry made by the World Health Organization, VAPP cases due to type 3 virus were found to be the most common in both vaccine recipients and their contacts. Type 2-induced VAPP occurred more often in contacts than in vaccinees, and Sabin 1 was rarely implicated (Esteves 1988).

For optimized transfection, the charge ratio of reagents to DNA or RNA is an important parameter; this ratio is usually kept as 2:1 to 4:1 to ensure that the complex carries a net positive charge. This facilitates the interaction of the vesicles with the negatively charged target-cell surface. In this study, however, more RNA was needed for optimal transfection efficiency. The RNA: Tfx-20 ratio used was 3:1.",

The successful rescue of both recombinant viruses in this study indicated that the established vectors still worked well when carrying the foreign genes. Both recombinant viruses expressed significant amounts of foreign antigen in the Vero cell cytoplasm, as confirmed by immunofluorescence detection. This observation is consistent with the PV life cycle, as PV completes its replication cycles in the cytoplasm. The gene fragment was expressed with the rest of the PV genome as part of the polyprotein and was cleaved away from the polyprotein by PV-encoded proteases, which cleaved at engineered proteolysis sites flanking the gene insert. The foreign antigens, as well as the viral proteins, released into the cytoplasm could be processed further and presented by the infected cells to stimulate an immune response against the recombinant virus, which is the basis of the polyprotein strategy for modifying PV to be a vaccine vector (Mattion et al. 1994). However, the immune responses against the foreign proteins need further investigation in transgenic mice carrying the human PV receptor (Tang et al. 1997) or in cynomolgus macaques (Crotty et al. 1999).",

Even plaque-purified rPV-SARS-RBD with the intact insert remained unstable over three further passages, suggesting that this foreign gene has inherently destabilizing attributes. Lee et al. (2002 ) reported that the genetic stability of recombinant PV is strongly associated with the G/C content and G/C distribution pattern in foreign inserts of less than 450 bp, and that the genetic instability of foreign inserts can be promoted by increasing the G/C content and/or replacing the local A/T-rich region with a G/C-rich codon. In our study, however, rPV-CTBM2e remained stable, although the G/C content of CTBM2e is low (36.9%). Both the large size (600 bp) and low G/C content (38%) of the SARS-RBD may contribute to the instability of the rPV-SARS-RBD virus. Further work is needed to increase the stability of this recombinant virus.",
