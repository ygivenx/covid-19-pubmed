Cell culture systems, using epithelial cells from the respiratory mucosa, may lack key physiological features such as cell polarization, reliable expression levels of cellular surface receptors or the intricate relationships between the different cell types present in the respiratory tract.\n39\n Primary cell cultures are difficult to establish, possess an inadequate distribution of the different cell types and become altered after a limited number of passages. Established continuous cell lines are by definition aberrant and usually belong to a cell type different to the natural target cells and, in some cases, are derived from a species different from the natural host. Ex vivo organ cultures provide an alternative solution. Nasal mucosa\n27\n and tracheal explants\n39\n immersed in cell culture medium have been used previously for the study of influenza infection.

In particular, the cells of the epithelial lining of the trachea maintain the same morphological appearance, differentiation and polarity as described in the living host. In contrast to submerged systems, once explants are inoculated, re\u2010infection from the culture medium or other components of the system is rare. The absence of a blood supply constitutes a weakness of the air interface EVOC system as recruitment of cells of the immune system to the infection site is abrogated.

The increase in the clearance time observed at later time points in uninfected explants may be associated with changes in pH, or energy limitations of the tissue.

With an intermediate dose, a single peak occurred at day 3 pi, whereas the lowest infection dose resulted in detectable virus at day 2 pi, followed by a subsequent rise in copy number at later time points. Such distinct patterns might be related to differential levels of innate immune response, as well as to the initial number of susceptible target cells. A large inoculum would be expected to infect most of the susceptible cells and viral replication may also trigger a massive innate immune response, resulting in a small number of susceptible cells available for a second round of viral replication. Once the antiviral signalling molecules are depleted, the remaining infectious particles can infect the susceptible cells, and this would be consistent with the second rise in virus titres observed at day 5 (Figure 5F). Although a second round of infection could not be ruled out, the peaks are too separated in time for this to be likely. A smaller dose of virus might trigger a milder innate immune response, restricted to neighbouring cells, allowing the virus to infect a larger number of cells over multiple rounds of infection. Accordingly, the kinetics of infection with the lowest viral dose displayed a marked shift to the right because more replication cycles were required to infect all or most of the susceptible cells. Further experiments that incorporate the quantification of cytokine expression will help to test this hypothesis.",
