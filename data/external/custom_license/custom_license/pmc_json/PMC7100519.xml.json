The oncolytic HSVs that have undergone clinical trials have had mutations in HSV genes \u03b334.5 and/or ICP6. ICP6 encodes a viral ribonucleotide reductase (vRR) function that allows replication of wild-type HSV to occur even in quiescent cells, such as the neurons that are infected during encephalitis caused by wild-type HSV type 1 (HSV1; Goldstein and Weller, 1988). Without this function, HSV replication is severely curtailed in quiescent cells (Goldstein and Weller, 1988). However, cycling cells upregulate expression of S-phase specific genes such as mRR for their own nucleic acid metabolism, which complements the defective viral ICP6 function, thus allowing these mutant HSVs to replicate (Goldstein and Weller, 1988). This complementation provides a biologic rationale for employment of ICP6-defective HSV in oncolytic therapy, rationale based on their preferential replication in cycling versus quiescent cells.",

Knowing that the downstream effect of p16INK4a (hereafter termed p16), a tumor suppressor gene on human chromosome 9p21 deleted in 30% of glioblastomas (Kamiryo et al., 2002), is to prevent transcription factor E2F1 from transcribing S-phase genes such as mRR (Elledge et al., 1992), we hypothesized that mutations in p16 would complement ICP6-defective HSV replication, even if cells were in quiescence and not actively cycling, thereby enabling ICP6-defective HSV to overcome limited infectability in quiescent cells in a molecularly targeted fashion.",

Overall, T98 cells produced significantly more hrR3 than fibroblasts, regardless of cell cycle status. More interestingly, the ratio of hrR3 yield in cycling versus noncycling cells was nearly threefold higher in normal fibroblasts than in T98 glioma cells (Figure 1).

In p16-deleted cells (that is, U87, T98 and p16\u2212/\u2212 MEFs), the ratio of mRR M2 subunit mRNA in cycling relative to noncycling cells was 0.9\u20131.3. However, in p16-expressing cells (that is, wild-type MEFs, human fibroblasts, p53\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and U373), this ratio was much higher (2.5\u20135.8; Figure 2). The finding of decreased mRR expression in noncycling p16+/+ cells agreed with published data showing mRR expression in cycling cells, with expected downregulation in G0 or growth-arrested cells (Elledge et al., 1992). However, in p16\u2212/\u2212 cells, mRR expression was maintained during G0, regardless of cell-cycle status, in agreement with the mechanism of p16-mediated suppression of mRR transcription (Elledge et al., 1992). We then stably transfected p16-expressing U373 glioma cells to overexpress the M2 subunit of mRR, creating a cell line, U373-mRR, which expressed 5.6-fold more mRR M2 subunit mRNA than U373 (data not shown). When infected with hrR3, the ratio of viral yield in cycling U373-mRR relative to noncycling U373-mRR was comparable to that seen in U87 or T98 cells and nearly threefold lower than that of U373 cells (Figure 1), suggesting that stably elevating the mRR M2 subunit expression throughout the cell cycle in U373 cells (Figure 2) enabled the support of viral replication independent of cell cycling status in a manner comparable to that seen in p16-deleted cells, such as T98 or U87 (Figure 1).",

Cerebral viral titers were similar when wild-type HSV was inoculated into the brains of wild-type and p16\u2212/\u2212 mice. However, p16\u2212/\u2212 mice produced three orders of magnitude more hrR3 than wild-type mice after intracerebral inoculation (Figure 3a). The LD50 (viral dose that killed 50% of inoculated mice 14 days after inoculation) was two orders of magnitude less when hrR3 was inoculated into the brains of p16\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice, but not significantly different when wild-type HSV was inoculated into the brains of wild-type or p16\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3b). Finally, the anatomic distribution of hrR3-mediated gene expression in neurons was much greater in the brains of p16\u2212/\u2212 mice than in the brains of wild-type mice and the former also exhibited evidence of increased inflammatory and necrotic effects caused by the host immune response which likely arose due to significant viral replication in this treatment group (Figure 3c). Taken together, these findings confirm the validity of the hypothesis that the ICP6-defective HSV1 retains significant replicative ability in cells with defects in p16, even if the cells are postmitotic or growth arrested.",

            "text": "Oncolytic viruses such as engineered HSVs, have produced significant anticancer effects in preclinical models, but have not shown definite efficacy in clinical trials (Aghi and Martuza, 2005). Speculated reasons for this lack of efficacy include viral doses that are less than the maximum tolerated dose, mutations that render oncolytic HSV less potent, inefficient spatial or temporal distribution of virus (Wein et al., 2003) and anti-HSV immunity impeding viral replication (Ikeda et al., 1999). Another reason for limited efficacy has been assumed to be that oncolytic HSV will infect and lyse cells in the tumor that are actively dividing, but that quiescent tumor cells may not support viral replication. In the case of gliomas, 85\u201395% of tumor cells may not be actively cycling at any one time (Hoshino et al., 1989). If quiescent tumor cells cannot support oncolytic HSV replication, then oncolytic HSVs would be unable to treat tumors like gliomas with large noncycling fractions, particularly because oncolytic viruses are administered intratumorally once at surgery, unlike other S-phase specific adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation which can be administered daily, enabling the targeting of cells that enter the cell cycle at different points in time. However, our results indicate that noncycling p16\u2212/\u2212 cells will still support the replication of ICP6-defective HSVs. These findings imply that ICP6-defective oncolytic HSV represents a molecularly targeted therapy for tumors with defects in the p16 tumor suppressor pathway. They also imply that other types of herpes viruses and poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus (McCart et al., 2001), with genetic defects other than vRR, such as viral thymidine kinase, whose cellular ortholog (mammalian thymidine kinase) is also under transcriptional control of the p16 tumor suppressor pathway, may also replicate in quiescent cells with defects in this pathway.",

            "text": "Another type of targeting of a downstream effector of p16 is represented by the E1A-defective adenoviruses (Jiang et al., 2005). In addition, viruses, such as coronavirus (Wurdinger et al., 2005) and measles virus (Nakamura et al., 2005), can be engineered to be selectively taken up by cells that express cell surface receptors, such as mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, that are specifically found on tumors. Other viruses target cells with alterations in the ras mitogenic pathway. Examples of such viruses include reovirus (Norman et al., 2004), HSV-2 with a deletion in the viral ICP10 gene (Fu et al., 2006) and HSV-1 with a deletion in the viral \u03b334.5 gene (Smith et al., 2006). Other viruses target tumor cells' propensity to exhibit altered biochemical properties, such as vesicular stomatitis virus, which targets cells with altered interferon responsiveness (Stojdl et al., 2000) or adenovirus ONYX-015 which targets cells that shut down cellular protein synthesis after infection (O'Shea et al., 2005). One key distinction between the type of targeting we found in HSVs lacking ICP6 and the targeting of these other viruses is that the targeting of HSVs lacking ICP6 allows them to infect quiescent tumor cells carrying p16 deletions, which can represent 85\u201395% of the cells in a glioma at any given moment in time (Hoshino et al., 1989).",

Viral recovery was nearly 30-fold lower when hrR3 was inoculated into the brains of FVB mice than in the other three experimental groups (P<0.05 by Student's t-test). Mice (n=10 per treatment group) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (75/15 mg kg\u22121 intraperitoneally) and immobilized in a stereotactic apparatus. Through a midline sagittal incision, a 1 mm skull burr hole was drilled l 1 mm anterior to and 2.5 mm right of the bregma. KOS and hrR3 virus (105\u20131010 pfu) in 2 \u03bcl virus buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5) were injected 4.5 mm below dura using Hamilton syringes.

Slides underwent blocking of endogenous peroxidase (DAKO PAP kit, Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark), incubating with goat serum for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C to reduce nonspecific background staining, incubation with mouse-anti-\u03b2-galactosidase antibody (Promega Biosciences, Madison, WI, USA) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, incubation with rabbit anti-mouse peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) for 2 h, incubation with 3\u2032,3\u2032-deamino-benzidine tetrahydrochloride per protocol (Dako) and hematoxylin staining. Scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm.",
