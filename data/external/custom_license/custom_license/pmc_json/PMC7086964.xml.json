            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to Group I of the family Coronaviridae. FCoV consists of three major proteins: nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein and peplomer spike (S) protein [23]. FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein [19, 20]. Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Thus, there are types I and II FECV and FIPV in FCoV. FECV is asymptomatic in cats, but FIPV causes FIP. It has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation [8, 29, 37], but the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified. FIP is a fatal disease, characterized by vasculitis associated with granulomatous inflammation containing B cells, neutrophils and macrophages. The infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions is unusual for a viral disease, but it is a typical finding of FIP [28].",

It has been reported that the difference in the proliferation of macrophages/monocytes is related to the difference in pathogenicity between FECV and FIPV [4, 31]. The possibility of feline vascular endothelial cell injury caused by metalloproteinase-9 and TNF-alpha produced by FIPV-infected monocytes has also been reported [12]. We reported that virus replication in macrophages induced TNF-alpha production, and the TNF-alpha produced was involved in aggravation of the FIP pathology: TNF-alpha produced by FIPV-infected macrophages was involved in lymphopenia and an increase in the level of the cellular receptor of type II FIPV, aminopeptidase N [34]. TNF-alpha reportedly inhibits neutrophil apoptosis [22], suggesting its involvement in the infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions in cats with FIP, but this has not yet been clarified. It is also unclear whether FIPV-infected macrophages/monocytes produce factors other than TNF-alpha that are related to the survival of neutrophils.",

WST-8 is a tetrazolium salt that reacts with mitochondrial dehydrogenases, forming the formazan dye. Expansion of viable cell numbers results in an increase in the activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases in the cells, corresponding to an increase in formazan dye metabolism. After the cells were returned to the incubator for 4 h, the absorbance of the formazan produced was measured at 450 nm with a 96-well spectrophotometric plate reader, as described by the manufacturer.

The transfer of peripheral blood neutrophils to marginal tissues, destruction of neutrophils due to excess antibody production, and direct cell death caused by viral infection are considered to be the causes of neutropenia [3, 16, 18, 19]. In human immunodeficiency virus and canine parvovirus infections, a reduced neutrophil count has been suggested to allow severe bacterial infection [14, 15]. Feline immunodeficiency virus and feline panleucopenia virus infections also affect stromal cells in the bone marrow, thus leading to a decreased production of neutrophils [17, 26]. In contrast, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which belongs to the same family as FIPV, can also cause neutrophilia [39]. Neutrophilia has been also reported in cats with FIP [25]. Paltrinieri [24] reported that cytokines accelerate the delivery of neutrophils to the inflamed lesions, thereby prolonging the lifespan of circulating neutrophils. He also reported that the apoptosis of neutrophils is delayed by cytokines, thus increasing the life of neutrophils in lesions. It is likely that neutrophilia in cats with FIP is associated with the infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions. However, there seems to be no established theory to explain the infiltration of neutrophils into granulomatous lesions in cats with FIP.",

We previously reported that FIPV-infected macrophages produced TNF-alpha and B-cell differentiation/survival factors, and these factors may have been involved in lymphopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia [33\u201335].

In inflammatory diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Kawasaki disease, the pathological condition is aggravated as the survival time of neutrophils is prolonged [5, 36]. Moreover, the pathological aggravation of inflammatory diseases is associated with protease and reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils [6, 32].
