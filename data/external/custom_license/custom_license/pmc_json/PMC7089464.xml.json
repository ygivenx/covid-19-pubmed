The S protein is also the dominant viral antigen and induces neutralizing host antibodies and protective immunity [2, 8]. The PEDV S protein was subdivided into the S1 (aa 1\u2013789) and S2 (aa 790\u20131383) domains. The globular part of S protein is formed by the S1 domain. It contains the major neutralizing and cellular receptor-binding residues, and plays an important role in mediating virus invasion of host cells [8, 9].",

Reports have shown that small peptides derived from phage display libraries exhibit excellent prospects as therapeutic agents against these diseases [10, 11]. Using hybridoma technology, we developed a monoclonal antibody to the PEDV S1 protein (designed MAb-5E12), which binds to the recombinant PEDV S1 protein (PEDV rS1) and recognizes the native PEDV [12]. In this study, MAb-5E12 was used as the immobilized target to biopan a 12-mer phage display random peptide library. Ten positive phage clones that specifically bind to MAb-5E12 were identified and constitute three distinct peptide sequences. Upon alignment with the native S1 protein, results indicated high sequence similarity to a region of the PEDV S1 protein. Using bioinformatics to assess B cell epitopes on the PEDV S1 protein indicated that the motif 201MQYVYTPTYYML212 was a putative linear, antigenic epitope. Among the sequences identified, two phage-derived peptides were synthesized and found to inhibit PEDV adsorption in a dose-dependent manner and in so doing exhibited anti-viral activity.",

Antigenic epitopes can be divided into linear epitopes and conformational epitopes. The linear epitopes are a few amino acids adjacent to each other on the primary structure of antigen. The conformational epitopes are discontinuous on the primary structure of antigen, but some amino acid residues near each other on the spatial structure [30].

S1 subunit makes up the globular part of S protein, which contains the specific receptor-binding domains (RBD) responsible for adsorption of virions to the receptor of host cells, while S2 subunit is responsible for mediating fusion [6]. So far, limited reports [7, 31, 32] showed that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) may act as a functional receptor of PEDV, but the accurate positions of RBD in PEDV S protein remain unclear. Studies have shown that phage display peptides which recognize pAPN are able to inhibit TGEV and PEDV infection of cells [17, 33]. Therefore, it is a good strategy for inhibition of virus enter into cells by interfering with the attachment of virus on the cell surface. Interestingly, in spite of the MAb 5E12 had no neutralizing activity against PEDV, using plaque-reduction, real-time PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assays, our data showed that peptide M and the MAb-5E12-recognizing peptides L and W significantly inhibited the adsorption of PEDV on the cell surface and thereby function as antiviral agents for PEDV. We assumed that it was possibly the smaller sizes of peptides M, L and W allowing for better recognition and/or binding to cellular receptors.",

As such, research efforts continue to search for functional epitopes that can be exploited as candidates for subunit vaccines [34\u201336].

Inasmuch as peptides L and W interacted with MAb-5E12, these may function both as modulators to enhance host immunity to infection, and as small molecule therapeutic agents against this disease.",
