As it is generally accepted that infections of mice with pathogenic microorganisms severely confound experimental results1, facilities housing mice typically use stringent microbiological monitoring systems that screen for a wide variety of pathogens and parasites. Rodent pinworms are the most commonly reported parasites in the modern animal facility, with prevalence of infestation ranging from more than 30% in specific pathogen\u2013free facilities to nearly 70% in conventional facilities2.",

These nematodes do not usually cause overt clinical disease in affected rodents, but alterations in host physiology have been reported3. In live rodents, Syphacia sp. can be detected by identifying eggs on a cellophane tape impression of the host's perianal region ('tape test'), and Aspiculuris sp. can be diagnosed using fecal flotation. Postmortem diagnostic testing is considered more reliable than these methods and involves direct examination of the rodent's cecal and colon contents for adult worms. Taxonomic classification of an adult nematode can be accomplished by microscopic examination of its head and tail3.",

Treatment regimens described in the literature include daily provision of medicated feed for at least 2 weeks (ref. 3) and provision of medicated feed on an alternating schedule (1 week of medicated feed, 1 week of normal feed) for 6\u201310 weeks (3\u20135 weeks of medicated feed)4,6. Fenbendazole has also recently been made available in hydrocellulose packs (Napa Nectar Plus, Systems Engineering Lab Group, Napa, CA), which were designed to replace animals' water supply. Fenbendazole treatment is considered an expensive option because of the relatively high cost of medicated feed and hydrocellulose packs, shipping costs and labor associated with delivering the treatment to cages. There might also be a delay while the order is manufactured and shipped to the facility, potentially allowing the infestation to spread further. Furthermore, if animals are on a specific diet as part of a study, replacement or supplementation of the diet may not be practical.",

Administering fenbendazole-medicated feed on an alternating schedule for 10 weeks (5 weeks of medicated feed) was the most expensive option. Alternatively, fenbendazole could be administered continuously for 14 d. Because the duration of the latter treatment method is shorter, it requires less feed and labor than treatment with an alternating schedule and is therefore less expensive. The continuous treatment schedule has been reported to be effective for eradicating Syphacia sp.4 but has not been attempted with Aspiculuris sp. It is possible that a longer course of treatment (and associated increase in cost) would be required because of the longer prepatent period of A. tetraptera. Additionally, it would take at least 2 weeks for the medicated feed to be ordered and delivered, delaying the start of either fenbendazole treatment.",

Lifting the carboys to the top of the racks was a potential ergonomic problem, as the carboys weighed approximately 18 kg when filled. Our facility owns a specialized hand crank lift, however, which is regularly used to remove and replace the motors from the top of the ventilated racks. We used this lift to safely raise the carboys to the top of the shelves. The configuration of the wall-mounted ventilated caging racks allowed secure placement of the carboys without concern of them falling (Fig. 3).",
