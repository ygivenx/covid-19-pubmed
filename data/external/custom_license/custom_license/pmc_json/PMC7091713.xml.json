This statement was based upon scientific evidence available at the early stage of SARS outbreak in 2003. Subsequent careful epidemiological and infection control study had shown that the principle index case responsible for SARS outbreak in Hong Kong community came from Prince of Wales Hospital. Moreover, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong was vetted to be the only hospital with the largest number of SARS cases under intensive care during early outbreak.1, 2 SARS is a highly infectious disease. It is not surprising that once there is a community outbreak, all the regional hospitals of the territory will have to tackle the multiplying suspect/probable cases. United Christian Hospital did admit a number of suspect and probable SARS cases, but significant number of them represented mutant strains during the second wave of \u2018super-spreading\u2019 infection.2",

            "text": "Regarding the proposed infection control measures in admitting patients to hospital, the underlying principle is a balance between the infection containment risk and the ophthalmic need for timely care.3 In the midst of SARS infection, a well-planned infection and ophthalmic triage system is mandatory. Our proposal has taken into consideration of these two competing interests. For instance, it is unethical to decline patients from proper ophthalmic care for the sake of infection containment need. There was cancellation but not to a 100% of clinical admission during SARS outbreak. To our knowledge, only a small number of nonurgent or nonessential operations were suspended in most of the eye service teams in Hong Kong. On the other hand, lowering the admission threshold while jeopardizing the infection control is equally unwise. The keys to this dilemma are judicious exercise of one's clinical judgment and close liaison with the hospital infection control team in the implementation of measure. Emergency ophthalmic patients obviously differ from the clinically admitted patients in term of the severity and urgency of their ocular conditions. Emergency eye patients are in need of almost immediate ophthalmic attention such as the acute angle closure glaucoma patients. They have to be admitted the sooner the better. Most of the time, investigation or treatment is instituted swiftly after the admission and owing to the complexity of the ocular problem, these patients are likely to stay at the hospital for a few days. In other words, if the emergency eye patients happen to have been infected by SARS coronaviruses but in incubation period, the risk of a major hospital outbreak should not be understated. Therefore, for emergency eye patients, an early isolation and observation in the infection triage ward are in conformity with the major infection control guidelines.4 As for the clinically admitted patients such as those coming for cataract operation, their time of stay inside hospital is comparatively shorter and they carry a lower risk of crossinfection in contrast to the emergency eye patients. Obviously, admitting all patients to the infection triage ward for observation is neither practical nor feasible. Screening by house eye surgeons is a realistic alternate without significant compromise of the infection containment principle.",
