The patients\u2019 files are monitored by clinical research associates who visited each center at least once a year. All patients with SDS are included in the registry, even if they are not profoundly neutropenic. SDS was diagnosed on the basis of neutropenia associated with exocrine pancreatic deficiency and skeletal, skin or liver abnormalities, after Pearson's syndrome had been ruled out. The patients or next of kin were required to give their informed consent to participation to the registry. The French SCN database was crossed with the French transplant database (Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais des Greffes). A total of 71 patients were included in the SDS database, and a complete report of the survey, analyzed at the cut-off date of March 2003, has been published elsewhere.21 In all, 11 patients developed bone marrow failure, which was transient in five cases and persistent (>3 months) in six cases. Among these latter six patients, the patient who did not receive HSCT died. Eight patients developed MDS/leukemia, of whom three patients who were not transplanted died. SBDS gene mutations were evaluated as described elsewhere.2",

In SDS, AL is diagnosed on the basis of cytologic criteria. It can, however, be difficult to distinguish between bone marrow aplasia and myelodysplasia on the sole basis of cytologic bone marrow studies. Indeed, cellular dysplasia is present in both instances and the cytologic aspects do not correspond to the FAB classification of myelodysplasias. It is therefore crucial to follow cytologic bone marrow studies by cytogenetic examination in order to distinguish between simple bone marrow depletion and clonal progression (\u2018myelodysplasia\u2019).

HSCT failed to correct the leukemia in one of our patients and in three of the 15 patients described in the literature. In addition, patients with SDS appear to be more susceptible to the toxicity of the HSCT procedure than are patients with other myelodysplastic disorders associated with monosomy 7, like the Kostmann syndrome26 and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.27 This susceptibility may be related to older age or to disease characteristics. Indeed, there is a marked age difference between patients receiving HSCT for bone marrow aplasia and for leukemic transformation, both in our series and in the literature (median age 4.5 and 13 years, respectively). Several risk factors could progress with age in this setting, including the nutritional consequences of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, liver disease, repeated infections and cardiac disorders. A risk of cardiomyopathy has been reported in patients with SDS in the absence of HSCT, fibrosis and necrotic lesions being found in 50% of SDS patients at necropsy; this was also the case of patient UPN 233015081, whose sibling died of cardiomyopathy.
