Ophthalmology is no exception. The Ophthalmologist, as one of the frontline health-care providers, has to inevitably face these new challenges and the ever-changing expectation upon our profession from patients and the community. Several clinical problems are particularly pertaining to the ophthalmic practice. Firstly, what we can be certain right now is that this novel Coronavirus-associated atypical pneumonia is extremely infectious as reflected by the high prevalence of infected health-care workers. By October 15, 2003, 386 of 1755 patients (21.9%) were health-care workers of hospitals/clinics or medical students. Most of them had a history of close contact with known or finally known SARS patients.7 It is still unclear whether ophthalmologists are at increased risk of infection in examining a proven or suspected SARS patient with short working distance, especially in performing direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination.",

Stool and urine have also been implicated as the possible media in harboring the infective agent.1, 2, 3 Tears and eye discharges are body secretions that may be equally or potentially more hazardous to health-care personnel, particularly ophthalmologists. In fact, tears have been reported by WHO to be one of the body fluids conveying the novel SARS-CoV, although the infectivity or clinical significance is still not known for the time being.8 The use of different instruments, which are in direct contact with patients' conjunctival mucosal surface may serve as possible routes and sources for disease transmission. The ultimate infectivity of the tears secretion and ocular discharge from SARS patients may bring impacts on not only the daily ophthalmic practice but also the universal infection control measures practiced by general public and health-care workers.",

Supplementary oxygen was required to alleviate the shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation. Chest radiography showed bilateral lung parenchymal infiltrates without consolidation. Respiratory physician recognized her condition as a probable case of SARS that required Intensive Care Unit admission with ventilatory support. At 3 days prior to the present admission, she had been seen by two of our colleagues in the outpatient consultation room. Immediate notification of the Infection Control Unit of the hospital was performed. The SARS Command Centre of the Department of Health of Hong Kong and the Hospital Authority consisting of infection disease clinicians, microbiologists, and epidemiologists were notified as well. In accordance with the infection surveillance protocol, the clinic doctors and nurses, who had a close contact with the patients, were required to have compulsory blood check for cell counts and chest radiography despite the fact that they did not exhibit any symptoms on initial assessment. The investigations were normal but they still have to be put on home quarantine for 7 days. Subsequently, the policy was further geared up to 10 days home quarantine for those health-care workers having unprotected contacts of similar setting. The diagnosis of the patient was finally revised and confirmed to be lupus pneumonitis with systemic flare-up. She succumbed on day 11 after admission. With such an experience, we have consolidated both the infection control and containment measures with respect to in-patient and outpatient ophthalmic services.",

The most important of all is frequent hand washing, preferably with the use of chlorhexidine alcoholic handrub (0.5\u20131.0% chlorhexidine in 80% ethyl alcohol, or a similar commercial product, such as Hexol\u00ae) in the prevention of crossinfection. The gloves, if used for high-risk procedures, must be changed and hand hygiene must be performed in between each contact with different patients. Staff are strongly advised not to touch their face-shield, eye protective wear, mask, head, and neck region before a thorough and complete hand washing procedure. Visitors are restricted in the hospital or clinic complexes unless under exceptional circumstances such as the escort of demented or visually impaired patients or parents of small children.3",

The personal protective equipment (PPE) with disposable caps, N95 respirator, goggles, face-shields, gloves, top and pants, and long protective gowns with high neck and long cuffed sleeves should be worn all the time when attending to these patients (Table 1). Under circumstances such as between cases and immediately following a high-risk procedure, all health-care workers have to abide by the decontamination process consisting of removal of all potentially contaminated protective wear in proper sequence and putting on clean protective wear. Once again, hand washing is strongly advised after removal of gloves and before attending another patient in order to minimize risk of crossinfection.",

A specifically designated consultation room with separate set of examining instruments and independent ventilatory system is highly desirable. The ventilatory system is preferably of exhaust fan type with filter, generating a negative room pressure with lamellar downward airflow. During the ophthalmic examination, patients themselves are required to put on the N95 respirator mask as well. Self-adhesive surgical plastic sheets that are commonly used during cataract surgery can be applied directly but lightly over the face and the nostril areas, leaving behind the eyes for examination. This innovative infection control measure specific for eye examination can help preventing any splashing of droplets from inadvertent coughing or deep breathing.",

Susceptibility of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 to chemical disinfection has been demonstrated by biological viral titration assay,10, 11 whereas similar in vitro data concerning the efficacy of different hospital disinfectant products (US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered disinfectants) against this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is currently lacking.12 Nevertheless, we can still make use of the available chemical germicides that could inactivate related viruses with similar physical and biochemical properties as the possible SARS agents. The adopted disinfection protocols in our ophthalmic practice are in line with the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention13 and based on the scientific evidences provided by APIC guidelines.14",

            "text": "SARS is one of the many viruses against which personnel will need protection in an ophthalmic setting. The experiences we have learnt also apply to other highly infectious disease, which can be spread by means of droplets.26 Avian influenza A (H5N1) is an example.27 It is a viral infection that can affect humans and cause serious disease and death.27, 28 There is still no solid evidence of human-to-human transmission in most of the outbreaks involving human cases.27 However, a recent clustering of cases in a family, probably resulting from person-to-person transmission during unprotected exposure to the critically ill index patient was recorded.28 These findings indicate that inefficient transmission is possible and reinforce the importance of infection control precautions among health-care workers.29 If H5 viruses do persist, they will likely continue to evolve, or reassort with existing human influenza viruses, to become more virulent and more easily transmitted subtypes from person-to-person.26, 30 We must be well prepared for any H5N1 outbreaks as it is difficult to eradicate the existing virus in nature with the potential reservoirs in wild birds.30 Strict adoption of the regularly revised infection control guidelines in accordance to the updated clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory information is the only way to prevent further large-scale hospital outbreak or crossinfection.",
