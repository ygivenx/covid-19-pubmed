It has been reported that both Ebola viruses and SARS\ncoronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) need to be transported to the endo/lysosomes\nto release their genomes (Fig.\n4A) (18). Therefore, HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses that\nbear the S proteins of SARS-CoVs were generated and used to test whether\ntheir entry could be repressed by teicoplanin. The data indicated that\nteicoplanin also inhibits the entry of SARS-CoVs (Fig. 4B). Given that Niemann-Pick\nC1 (NPC1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) represent the cell\nreceptors of Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs, respectively (16, 34, 35), and that\nteicoplanin inhibits both of these viruses, it is necessary to clarify\nwhether Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs share cell receptor affinity.\nFollowing depletion of the expression of NPC1 and ACE2 in HEK293T cells\nusing siRNAs, the cells were infected with Ebola or SARS-CoV pseudotyped\nviruses. The results demonstrated that the knockdown of NPC1 affected\nthe infectivity of Ebola but not that of SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses,\nwhereas the converse was observed following ACE2 knockdown (Fig. 4C). This\nindicates that these two viruses are each associated with specific\nreceptors and also excludes the possibility that teicoplanin inhibits\nthe interaction between the viruses and their cell receptors or the\nevents following receptor binding. Taken together, these data led us to\nhypothesize that the target of teicoplanin would be the host factor(s)\nwhich is (are) required for both Ebola and SARS-CoV infection.\nConsidering that interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs)\nrepresent the first line of anti-viral defense of the cells, we first\nexamined the effect of teicoplanin on the expression of IFITMs. However,\nthe data showed that teicoplanin did not induce the expression of IFITMs\n(data not shown).",

Through genome-wide\nhaploid genetic screening, several host factors essential for Ebola\nviral infection have been identified (16). Accordingly, we infected cells with Ebola-, SARS-CoV-,\nor VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses after siRNA-mediated knockdown of the\nexpression of 13 individual host factors. We found that cathepsin L\n(CTSL), VPS11, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are required for both\nEbola and SARS-CoV infection (Fig.\n5B) rather than VSV infection. These results\nimply that the host factors might be the targets of teicoplanin. VPS11,\nVPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are components of HOPS complexes, which\nmediate the homotypic fusion between late endosomes and the heterotypic\nfusion between late endosomes and lysosomes (29, 36,\n37). To investigate whether\nteicoplanin affects the transport of Ebola viruses by inhibiting HOPS\ncomplex function and subsequently disturbing endosome maturation and\nfusion between the late endosomes and the lysosomes, a dextran uptake\nassay was conducted (Fig.\n5C). We found that within 2 h of uptake, the\ndextran-Alexa Fluor 568 could be transported into lysosome-associated\nmembrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive lysosomes. The co-localization\ncoefficient of dextran and LAMP1 was influenced by siRNA knockdown of\nVPS39 and VPS41, whereas teicoplanin did not exert any effect (Fig. 5D). These data\nindicated that teicoplanin does not inhibit the transport of\ndextran-Alexa Fluor 568. Therefore, it is unlikely that teicoplanin\ninhibits the entry of Ebola viruses by affecting HOPS complexes. In\naddition, we conducted virion uptake assays to demonstrate that\nteicoplanin does not inhibit both Ebola- and VSV-pseudotyped virion\nuptake at 0.5, 1, and 2 h post-infection (Fig. 5, E and F). These\ndata indicated that teicoplanin did not affect the endocytosis of Ebola-\nand VSV-pseudotyped virions, at least the early phase. In addition,\nthese data also indicated that, except HOPS complexes, teicoplanin has\nno effect on the other host factors that are involved in the process of\nvirion uptake.",

The proteolysis of glycoprotein by cathepsin L has been\nreported to be required for the membrane fusion of both Ebola viruses\nand SARS-CoVs (31). In contract,\ncathepsin B is required for Ebola virus infection but not SARS-CoV\ninfection (17, 31). As such, we hypothesized that\ncathepsin L rather than cathepsin B could be the target for teicoplanin.\nTo this end, we examined whether teicoplanin can inhibit the enzymatic\nactivity of cathepsin L (Fig.\n6A). Two assays to measure the cathepsin L\nenzymatic activity were performed (30, 31). We showed\nthat teicoplanin potently inhibits the activity of cathepsin L in a\ndose-dependent manner (Fig. 6,\nB and E). Considering that the\ninhibitory dose of teicoplanin on the activity of cathepsin L is higher\nthan that required for Ebola virus infection inhibition, a cell\nviability assay was performed to confirm that the inhibitory effect is\nnot due to cytotoxicity (Fig.\n6C). In addition, a comparative analysis of\nthe inhibitory dose of teicoplanin and that of previously reported\ncathepsin L inhibitors, Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl\nketones, on Ebola virus infection was conducted. We demonstrated that\nboth compounds can inhibit Ebola virus infection at low doses. The\nIC50 dose of teicoplanin required to inhibit the Ebola\nentry is approximately four times more than that of\nZ-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketones (Fig. 6D and Table 2). Similarly, the\nIC50 dose of teicoplanin required to inhibit the\nenzymatic activity of cathepsin L was also approximately four times\ngreater (Fig. 6, B\nand E, and Table\n2). These data indicated that the high doses of teicoplanin\ndetermined to be required for the inhibition of cathepsin L enzymatic\nactivity could be due to the relatively low sensitivity of the cathepsin\nL activity assay. These data clearly demonstrate the consistency between\nthe inhibition of virus entry and the inhibition of cathepsin L activity\nand further support our conclusion that the target molecule of\nteicoplanin is cathepsin L.",

            "text": "Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic isolated from Actinoplanes\nteichomyceticus. Teicoplanin contains five major components (39, 40)\nthat can form complexes with the C-terminal\nl-Lys\u2013d-Ala\u2013d-Ala subunits of lipid II\npeptidoglycan precursors. Teicoplanin binding of lipid II inhibits their\ntransglycosylation and transpeptidation, leading to disturbed cell wall synthesis in\nGram-positive bacteria (41). Recently,\nteicoplanin was reported to inhibit Ebola pseudovirus infection in cell culture,\nwhich is consistent with our observations. Teicoplanin was also demonstrated to have\nan effect on a common component used by both enveloped Ebola viruses and human\nrespiratory syncytial viruses but not by non-enveloped viruses (26). However, the mechanism by which\nteicoplanin inhibits the entry of Ebola remained unresolved. To elucidate the\nmolecular mechanisms underlying this process, we compared the entry of Ebola viruses\nand SARS-CoVs and the effect of teicoplanin thereon. Teicoplanin represses the entry\nof both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs, which require transport to the endo/lysosomes\nto deliver their genomes. Because several host factors have been reported to be\nessential for Ebola and SARS-CoV virus infection, the identification of the common\nhost factors that are required for the entry of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs\nwould likely be helpful to clarify the target of teicoplanin. Our data demonstrated\nthat CTSL, VPS11, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are all indispensable for the\nentry of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs (Fig.\n5B). The elucidation via a dextran uptake assay that\nteicoplanin does not affect the functions of HOPS complexes suggested that the\ntarget of teicoplanin was cathepsin L. In support of this, the results of two\ncathepsin L enzymatic activity assays indicated that teicoplanin indeed inhibits the\nactivity of cathepsin L, which can explain why teicoplanin inhibited both the entry\nof Ebola viruses and human respiratory syncytial viruses as shown in a previous\nstudy (26) because cathepsin L is required\nfor the infection mechanism of both (17,\n42). Considering that cathepsin L is also\nrequired for the entry of MERS-CoVs, teicoplanin thus represents a broad virus entry\ninhibitor. In addition, the inhibitory effects of teicoplanin and its derivatives on\nHIV-1, HCV, influenza viruses, flaviviruses, FIPV, and SARS-CoVs have also been\nreported (43\u201349), further supporting that the antiviral target for glycopeptide\nantibiotics is a common host factor.",
