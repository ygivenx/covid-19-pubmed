            "text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a multifunctional cytokine which plays a major role in angiogenesis. Alternative splicing causes the production of several different isoforms(VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF183, VEGF189, VEGF206; Byun et al. 2001; Cohen et al. 1999). VEGF is essential for tumor angiogenesis, and several studies have correlated elevated VEGF levels with tumor stage, metastases, and progression (Fernandez et al. 2004). We recently isolated a novel neutralizing human anti-VEGF165 single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) from a phage antibody library (Lin and Lei 2008). Although monoclonal antibody (mAb) possesses a higher specific activity than polyclonal immunoglobulins and is suitable for large-scale production, hybridoma cell lines are not stable, especially after cryopreservation (Rando and Notkins 1994). Some of the limitations of mAb can be overcome by a genetically engineered antibody. scFv is a small antibody-engineered antibody (molecular mass about 30 kDa), in which the variable heavy chain and light chain of the antibody molecule are connected by a short, flexible polypeptide linker (Gly4Ser)3 (Huston et al. 1991). This antibody fragment retains the original antigen-binding site allowing it to maintain its specific affinity for the antigen (Huston and George 2001). The advantages of scFv are its stability as a protein, the fact that it can be produced in large scale in Escherichia coli at low cost. However, as scFv is a small protein with disulfide bonds, it is almost impossible to fold well in the intracellular environment of E. coli. Several protein fusion systems, such as His6-tagged, glutathione-S-transferase and thioredoxin, have been applied to express and purify scFv, but these methods have shortcomings in efficient soluble expression, cleavage, and purification.",

            "text": "Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family proteins function as post-translation modifiers by covalently and reversibly attaching to other proteins (Johnson and Blobel 1999). SUMO modifies many proteins which are involved in a wide range of cellular process such as transcriptional regulation, nuclear transportation, chromosome organization, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, and signal transduction (Kuliopulos and Walsh 1994). SUMO and its associated enzymes are present in all eukaryotes and are highly conserved from yeast to human but are absent from prokaryotes (Lamsoul et al. 2005). Although SUMO has only 18% sequence identity with ubiquitin, it shares a common three-dimensional structure (Lavallie and McCoy 1995). Similar to ubiquitin, SUMO functions by covalent modification of the target protein via a peptide bond that can be specifically cleaved by SUMO protease. Recently, SUMO, fused at the N terminus with heterologous proteins was found to improve protein folding, to enhance expression level, and to protect the protein from degradation via its chaperoning properties. SUMO fusion protein can be cleaved by the SUMO protease according to SUMO protein three-dimensional structure, and the target protein was obtained with native N terminus (Li and Hochstrasser 1999, 2003). Several proteins including matrix metalloprotease 3, green fluorescent protein, SARS-CoV 3CL, and SARS-CoV Spike C were successfully expressed and purified using this fusion strategy (Liew et al. 2005). In the present study, we report the high-level expression and rapid purification of scFv with a SUMO fusion strategy.",

In a previous paper (Lin and Lei 2008), we reported the isolation of a novel human anti-VEGF165 scFv, selected from a phage antibody library. The cDNA coding for the anti-VEGF165 scFv was amplified from the vector pHEN2 by PCR using primers P3 (5\u2032-GGAGGTGTGCAGCTGGTG-3\u2032) and P4 (5\u2032-GAAGCTCTCGAGTTATTTACCCGGGGAC-3\u2032). The P1 and P4 had NcoI and XhoI recognition sites (italicized), respectively, for directed cloning into the vector. The P1 and P2 primers were used to amplify the cDNA sequence of SUMO, with an extra NcoI recognition site. The P3 and P4 primers were used to amplify the sequence of scFv. After the first round of PCR using P1/P2 and P3/P4, respectively, gel purification was performed for the two products. A second round of PCR followed using the two resulting PCR products and the P1, P4 primers to obtain the fragment encoding SUMO\u2013scFv. Then, the fragment was digested with NcoI and XhoI and inserted in frame into the pET-28a expression vector (Novagen). DH5\u03b1 competent cells were transformed firstly and screened in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/ml). The plasmids were then confirmed by endonuclease restriction digestion assay and further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid was named pET28a/SUMO\u2013scFv (Fig. 2).",

SUMO is a ubiquitin-like protein containing approximately 100 amino acids, which is highly conserved in eukaryotes and absent from prokaryotes. We hypothesize that the attachment of a highly stable and compact SUMO structure to the N terminus of the scFv proteins will facilitate correct protein folding and enhance solubility and expression. A rationale for the role of SUMO in promoting solubility of insoluble proteins is that the inner SUMO core is a dense hydrophobic globular structure and the protein surface is hydrophilic and highly water soluble (similar to amphipathic detergents).",
