            "text": "The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was first characterized in the West Crimean region of the former Soviet Union in 1944 during a large outbreak and was isolated in 1956 from a patient [1\u20134]. The virion is spherical, ~90\u2013100 nm in diameter and is in the form of enveloped particles with a tripartite, single-stranded RNA genome having negative polarity. This virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae and causes fatal viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, with a reported high mortality rate [5]. The genus Nairovirus includes 34 described viruses, which are placed in seven serogroups based on the antigenic relatedness. The groupings have subsequently been sustained through demonstration of morphological and phylogenetic relatedness. Only three viruses of this genus are known to cause human disease: they are CCHFV, Dugbe and Nairobi sheep disease virus [6]. In India, among NSD group, Ganjam virus is considered a variant of NSDV. Ganjam virus, also known to cause human infection, is transmitted through Hyalomma species of ticks. The antibodies against this virus have been recorded in animals and humans [7\u201311]. CCHF virus has tri-partite genome segments; small (S), medium (M) and large (L), which encode for the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the envelope glycoproteins G1 and G2 and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase respectively [12\u201314].",

There are reports of viral isolation and/or disease in Africa, Asia, southeast Europe and the Middle East [15\u201321]. The average case fatality rate is 30\u201350 %, but variable mortality rates from 5 to 80 % have been reported in various outbreaks. The mortality rate is higher with nosocomial infections than through tick bites which may be related to the virus dose [24].",

            "text": "India has been considered as a hot spot for many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases [25].There has been suspicion of CCHFV presence in India due to confirmed CCHF positive cases in adjoining countries like Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan [11, 26]. India has an ancient history with these countries and also trade records of livestock and human movements. The presence of this virus in India raised high suspicion, when it was isolated from the tick species Hyalomma anatolicum and also from a mixture of Hyalomma and Boophilus species collected in Pakistan [27]. In 1973, Shanmugam et al. [28], tested a total of 643 human sera from all over India. Of these, nine samples from Kerala and Pondicherry were found positive for CCHF virus specific antibody. In the same study, 34 out of 655 serum samples, collected from sheep, horse, goat and other domestic animals from all over India showed evidence of CCHFV antibodies. Most of the positive sera in southern India were collected from goats. Evidence of hemagglutination inhibition antibody positivity was recorded in the animal sera tested during a serosurvey conducted in Jammu and Kashmir and in the western border districts of India in 1976. In the same study antibodies were also detected in domestic animal sera from different states/territories of southern India and from Maharashtra state. Mainly goat serum samples from South India were found to be positive [29]. Subsequently, in 1977, Kaul et al. [30], conducted a survey of Ixodid ticks to determine the CCHFV activity in Jammu and Kashmir State, India, but CCHFV isolation was not obtained from 138 pools comprising eight species under six genera of ticks. All these studies were based only on serological findings in which no virus isolation could be achieved and hence no clear evidence of this virus could be obtained. During December 2010, just prior to CCHF outbreak, blood samples were collected by the NIV, Pune to examine livestock for the presence of CCHFV specific IgG antibodies from abattoirs in the northern adjoining state of Rajasthan and some more distant areas of Maharashtra and West Bengal. The serum samples of buffalo, goat and sheep from Sirohi district, in southern Rajasthan were found positive for IgG antibodies against CCHFV. In January 2011, cases with hemorrhagic manifestations among hospital staff were reported from Ahmadabad of Gujarat State, India. Out of 86 samples screened, one hospital and one family contact (both asymptomatic) were positive for the presence of IgM antibodies against CCHFV and three CCHF positive cases showed high titer of IgM antibodies [31]. Speculation was made that higher number of suspected cases were present in Gujarat State [32]. Animal serum samples from northern West Bengal and Pune district of Maharashtra were negative for CCHFV IgG antibodies. Evidence of CCHFV infection (IgG positive) was also found in a follow-up study of livestock (buffalo, cattle, goat, and sheep) from Kolkata and the surrounding villages of Changodar, Jivanpara and Navapura. Overall it was observed that IgG antibody positivity in small sample sizes varied between villages (10\u201343 %) [31].",

Recent, S segment analysis had shown that CCHFV strains cluster in six to seven distinct groups as West-Africa in group I, Central Africa in group II, South-Africa and West Africa in group III, Middle-East and Asia in group IV, Europe in group V and Greece in group VI. The group IV may split into two distinct groups, Asia 1 and Asia 2. Complete genome analysis of CCHFV isolates not only revealed high genetic diversity but also showed recombination and re-assortment which resulted in more complicated evolutionary routes of the virus, than a mutation-based selective forces [33\u201337]. Earlier data on serological testing has suggested that there are very few significant differences among strains of CCHFV at different geographic locations. However, more recent data based on nucleic acid sequence analysis have revealed the extensive genetic diversity [38].",

Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the four isolates of 2011, as well as the S segment from isolates of 2010 were highly conserved and clustered together in the Asian/Middle East genotype IV. The S segment of South-Asia 2 type was closest to a Tajikistan strain TADJ/HU8966 of 1990 (98.5 % nucleotide identity) while the M segment was closest to type M2. Both M and L segments were closest to an Afghanistan strain Afg09-2990 of 2009 (93 and 98 % nucleotide identity respectively). Thus, the Indian isolates were identified as a South-Asia 2/M2 far-east virus combination and the differing parental origin in the S and L/M segments suggested that it might be an intra-genotypic reassortant. The molecular clock studies further revealed that the ancestry of these viruses was not very recent and dated back to about 33 years on the basis of the S segment, whereas it was about 15 years based on the M segment. However, the 2011 outbreak may not have resulted from a very recent introduction. Considering this, so far there was no evidence which confirmed multiple circulating strains in the country. The CCHFV sequences of human case from 2012 showed similarity with CCHFV sequences of year 2010 and 2011, reported from India, which indicates that same virus strain was in the circulation (NIV, unpublished data). Subsequently, the possibility of a recent re-introduction of the virus from any of the neighboring countries cannot be ruled out [39].",

CCHFV has been isolated from numerous domestic and wild vertebrates; cattle, goats, sheep, hares, hedgehogs, a Mastomys spp. of mouse and even antibodies against CCHFV have been detected in the sera of domestic animals [41\u201344]. Large herbivores have the highest seroprevalence rate for CCHFV [45]. Seroprevalence rates of 13\u201336 % have been reported in some studies, while others suggest that more than 50 % of adult livestock in endemic regions have antibodies against the virus. CCHFV infections are asymptomatic in animals other than experimentally inoculated newborn rodents (laboratory mice, rats and Syrian hamsters) [46]. The potential roles of migratory birds and the movement of livestock carrying ticks in the spread of the virus over distant geographical areas have been described. Although birds carry CCHF infected ticks, they don\u2019t show presence of the virus or CCHFV specific antibodies [11, 47].",

            "text": "Humans appear to be the only host of CCHFV in which the disease is manifested. Clinical progress of CCHF differs from mild to moderate or severe. Initial symptoms of CCHF differ from patient to patient. The typical course of CCHF shows that the disease progresses through four distinct phases, i.e., incubation, pre-hemorrhagic, hemorrhagic and convalescence [29]. The clinical features observed commonly in CCHF patients from India were high grade fever, headache, body ache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, malaise, photophobia, diarrhea, petechiae, ecchymosis and visceral bleeding. Bleeding from other sites including the vagina has also been reported in the very severe cases [15, 34, 53]. The common laboratory findings of CCHF patients who died due to this infection from India demonstrated elevated prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), leucopenia and thrombocytopenia [15, 53, 54]. It has been found that in some patients CCHF develops into a serious or fatal disease while in others it is only mild or asymptomatic but in India most of the cases showed severe manifestations [54, 55]. One of the major reasons for nosocomial infection of CCHF could be the high viral load which helps in virus dissemination [56]. In severe cases, hemorrhagic manifestations develop within 3\u20136 days after onset of disease. Hence, it becomes imperative to provide a differential diagnosis for CCHF with respect to other viral diseases mimicking the similar signs and symptoms which will be helpful in early treatment of affected patients. The pathogenesis of CCHF is not well understood due to the limited number of Biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) laboratories and unavailability of proper animal model. However, a common pathogenic feature of viruses causing VHF is their ability to disable the host immune response by attacking and manipulating the cells that initiate the antiviral response [57].",

The differential diagnosis of CCHF differs depending on that particular geographic region. In India, overlapping symptoms of hemorrhagic fevers like dengue, Kyasanur forest disease, Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever and other diseases (Malaria, meningococcal infections and leptospirosis) are of major concern in CCHF diagnosis [58]. The diagnosis of VHF is mainly based on typical clinical presentation and thereafter confirmed by detection of either virus or viral RNA or by demonstration of a rise of antibody titers against it [59]. Laboratory diagnosis of CCHFV includes the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR assay, which is the method of choice for the rapid detection of viral RNA in the acute phase, considered highly specific, sensitive and rapid [60\u201362]. The consumables and instrumentation required for these techniques are cost expensive and out of the financial reach of many local laboratories. This can delay the timely diagnosis and in turn early management of patients. Detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) during the acute phase and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in convalescent phase sera is detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) [63, 64]. Patients with fatal disease as well as patients in the first few days of illness do not usually develop a measurable antibody (IgM) response and in these individuals diagnosis is achieved either by virus detection in blood, serum, plasma, urine or tissue samples using molecular techniques.",

The process, system and test method used for diagnosis are consistently validated for quality assurance. These laboratories are accredited internationally which assures the clinician and the patients that the test reports are reliable and also gives a feedback to the laboratory on its performance as per international standards. As this virus belongs to risk group-4, there are limitations for diagnosing CCHF in several affected areas. Also there is high risk involved in the infectious sample collection and transportation to diagnostic laboratories which are important issues that needs to be addressed by hospitals or any agency involved in it. At the source while collecting samples in outbreak scenario, personal protection equipment, packing of samples should be performed as per international guidelines described by WHO and CDC [65, 66].

As per the protocol the patients are categorized into three types as follows.I.Category-A: These patients have relatively mild disease (fever <38.5 \u00b0C, No systemic bleeding, Alanine Transaminase (SGPT) levels <150 IU, Platelet count >50,000). These patients improve spontaneously in about day 10 of illness. The patient can be managed with supporting therapy and regular monitoring for worsening of symptoms.II.Category-B: These patients are in the first 5 days of illness and are severely ill with high grade fever (>38.5 \u00b0C), local and systemic bleeding manifestations, having Alanine Transminase (SGPT) levels of 150 IU or more, aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) of 200 IU or more, platelets (<50,000) or aPTT of 60 s or more.III.Category-C: These patients first seen/recognized as CCHF after day 5 and are in a terminal state with disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi organ failure. Treatment with ribavirin is indicated but the prognosis is very poor. Because the effectiveness of ribavirin is controversial, usage of ribavirin for the treatment of CCHF should be left to the decision of physician and patient.\n",

Supportive care includes fluid management by intravenous crystalloids, oxygen, cardiac monitoring and administer blood and blood products as clinically indicated. Intramuscular injections and the use of aspirin or other anticoagulants should be avoided. Invasive procedures should be minimized because of the risk associated with viral transmission from sharp objects. There is currently no specific antiviral therapy for CCHF. However, the antiviral drug ribavirin has been found effective against the CCHFV in vitro, although its exact mechanism of action against this virus is unclear. Although its clinical use in CCHF treatment is controversial, it is the only antiviral drug currently available [68\u201370]. However the benefits of ribavirin treatment have not been examined under the strict conditions of a randomized clinical trial and the drug is not approved for the treatment of CCHF by the US Food and Drug Administration [71]. Ribavirin therapy was found to be effective in CCHF patient when administered in the early phase of illness during CCHF outbreak in Gujarat [54]. The optimal route of administration of ribavirin is by mouth preferably taken with food. During the course of CCHF patients have nausea, vomiting, gut bleeding, hematemesis and malena and hence potentially poor uptake of oral Ribavirin. Blood Count needs to be monitored at least weekly. Ribavirin was generally well tolerated. The most common side effect of ribavirin is mild to moderate hemolytic anemia which is reversible. Anemia associated with ribavirin therapy is often asymptomatic and can be managed by monitoring blood count and serum biochemistry. Ribavirin is contraindicated for treatment in pregnant women. Given the high risk of CCHF-related mortality for both pregnant women and fetuses, ribavirin still may be recommended. Ribavirin is contraindicated in patients with chronic anemia and hemoglobin levels below 8 g/dl, and in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min). The drug may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function. These patients should be carefully monitored during therapy with ribavirin for signs and symptoms of toxicity, such as anemia. In case of hypotension and hemodynamic instability patients should be managed on standard guidelines for the treatment of shock which includes resuscitation, fluid supplements (crystalloids/colloids) and ionotropic support. In suspected secondary bacterial infection patient should be treated on standard guidelines/practice for community acquired/nosocomial infections. Platelet transfusion may be considered if there is significant bleeding with thrombocytopenia. Ventilatory/renal support may be provided as per the standard guidelines.",

A similar process was carried out in the case of Shalby hospital by the doctor who had attended one of the CCHF cases. In a special move, the Ahmadabad municipal corporation carried out surveillance in all cattle sheds within corporation limits and abattoirs that operate both legally and illegally. The major concern was the Hyalomma ticks that are present on the cattles which are the transmitters of the deadly disease. The strategic actions taken by the State Government included active human, animal and entomological surveillance. Isolation and treatment of cases following universal precautions, contact tracing and monitoring contacts, spraying cattle in the affected area with anti-tick agents, spraying human dwelling with residual sprays and communicating the risk to the public. In view of the CCHF outbreak, Department of Health, Government of India alerted the states neighboring Gujarat to pick up cases of hemorrhagic fever at the earliest and to review the situation in their states and remain prepared to detect, verify and respond to outbreaks of CCHF. The National Institute of Virology, Pune has been actively involved in surveillance of CCHF in Gujarat and has proposed to carry out nationwide serosurvey of CCHF in domestic animals. Such surveillance will reveal the clear scenario of the existence of CCHFV in different states of India and will help in assessing the possibility of risk by CCHF virus to all the animal handlers in the dairy industry.",

CCHF was recently recognized in India; whereas from so many years its presence has been reported from the neighboring countries. The short incubation period and many of the non-specific symptoms overlapping other hemorrhagic fevers, raises the risk of humans carrying the CCHF virus to naive areas. This can lead to secondary infection amongst travel companions, close contacts, and healthcare providers. The environmental factors, climate and human behavior are critical determinants for the establishment and maintenance of CCHF endemicity within an area. Even though the explanations about CCHF emergence or re-emergence have been formulated, the contribution of each of these factors has not been quantified. Those persons who fall in the high risk group populations can reduce the risk of CCHFV transmission through changes in the land use, recreational activities and livestock movement. Increasing awareness about this dreadful disease among people might help in reducing its incidence rate. Introduction of CCHFV to a non-endemic area could take place either through legal or illegal trade of infected animals, animals infested with infected ticks, through geographic expansion of infected Hyalomma ticks from CCHF-endemic areas. The reasons for the emergence and re-emergence of CCHF are multifactorial, which are partly understood. Effective surveillance and reporting of the cases is necessary to monitor the spread of the disease in near future. Multidisciplinary research focusing on developing sensitive diagnostic tools, building biobank of clinical samples, development of new antivirals and vaccines will be useful to prevent or counter/tackle future outbreaks.",
