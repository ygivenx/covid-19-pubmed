Interestingly, results of the present study showed that antimicrobial treatment before the first examination of participating calves was associated with higher odds of finding M. bovis at sampling.

The weight given to each parameter studied in the global score may be different according to different management practices such as those used in smaller herds. Consequently, it seemed important to determine a threshold that would be suitable for the particular population studied. In the present study, the optimal clinical score threshold for predicting lung consolidation (an objective measure of lung lesions) was determined based on the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity. In other words, this optimal threshold would provide the lowest possible number of classification errors (diseased or not). Determination of disease definitions in the absence of a gold standard by using an objective outcome for comparison has been commonly used for conditions such as hyperketonemia and postpartum endometritis in dairy cows.14, 15 Such an approach represents an improvement to the current standard procedure for conditions that have substantial detrimental impacts on health, culling, or reproductive performance, and that are difficult to diagnose clinically (mostly subclinical diseases). One could argue that this could have biased the clinical status definition used in the study toward more severe and chronic cases compared with the definition commonly used on farms. In the case of BRD, the use of an objective outcome is crucial considering that, in an experimental model, lung consolidation was seen by transthoracic ultrasonography as soon as 2 hours after infection with M. haemolytica.9 Therefore, it is very likely that lung consolidation could appear much earlier than clinical signs of disease. This may be an explanation for the fact that 65% of calves with lung lesions had clinical scores <7. On the other hand, 1 other explanation could be that calves have chronic lesions not associated with clinical signs. The use of clinical disease status then should be targeted at predicting the lung consolidation status of animals with the greatest accuracy.",

Clinical status and lung consolidation also were only evaluated once. Consequently, it was not possible to determine which stage of the diseases (ie, very acute, clinically active, or chronic) affected the calves.

Numerous mycoplasma species have been isolated from the nasal flora of healthy calves,23 but some of them, such M. dispar,18\nM. canis,24 and M. californicum,25 have been associated with BDR in calves. They are mainly associated with subclinical infections and are suspected to play a role in the induction of BRD by negatively affecting the immune system and upper respiratory defense mechanism.2 In the present study, no association was found between the isolation of Mycoplasma spp. and clinical status, lung consolidation, or ADG. Unfortunately, these Mycoplasma spp. were not specifically identified in the present study. Mycoplasma spp. identified by PCR in lung tissue have been reported to be associated with pneumonic lesions in young dairy calves of <1 month of age.11 In 1 recent study on young dairy calves, culture of Mycoplasma spp. in midnasal and deep pharyngeal swabs was associated with clinical cases of BRD.17 However, no distinction between M. bovis and other Mycoplasma species was made, which could be an important confounding factor for the association between Mycoplasma spp. and BRD. These discrepancies point out the importance of the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in cases of BRD and the necessity for additional studies for the determination of the pathogenic role of Mycoplasma species other than M. bovis in young dairy calves experiencing BRD.",

This finding is consistent with the results of another study conducted in dairy calves from large herds in California.17 The exact role of this virus in the development of BRD is still unknown and its pathogenic role in BRD is still unclear.4 In young dairy calves, BCV has been associated with mild clinical signs of pneumonia, cough, rhinitis, fever, and anorexia, usually in association with enteritis.5 In 1 Norwegian study, dairy calves in herds with BCV seropositive calves were at a higher risk of developing pneumonia compared with calves in herds with only seronegative calves.26 However, frequent and intermittent nasal shedding has been reported in dairy calves with or without clinical signs of respiratory disease.27, 28\n",

            "text": "In opposition to a study in the United States in which BRSV was isolated in 14.1% of dairy calves,17 it was only detected once in this study (1%). This is similar to the finding of a Scottish study in which 0.7% of dairy calves were positive.16 The sample size, herd, and calf recruitment procedure in the present study potentially could explain the low prevalence of BRSV in the study population. Bovine viral diarrhea and IBR and PI\u20103 viruses were not found in the present study. This finding is in agreement with another study conducted in California in which there were no animals positive for BVD or BHV\u20101.17 In another study conducted on 295 dairy calves, PI\u20103 was detected in 17.9% of animals.16 All herds included in the study except 1 (in which BRSV was detected) had vaccination protocols for the prevention of infection by these viruses, and these protocols may have controlled and precluded dissemination of these viruses within the herds. Nonetheless, viral excretion in the nasal cavity is generally of a short duration (usually <1 week, depending on the virus), which makes viral isolation within a herd or an animal difficult if repetitive sampling is not performed. Consequently, it is difficult to conclude based on the absence of these viruses that they are not important pathogens in BRD in dairy calves in Qu\u00e9bec.",

This sample size was based on a calculation of the sample size needed to provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.3 g/d (pathogen present: 0.5 kg/d; pathogen absent: 0.8 kg/d) in ADG between 2 groups, and a difference of 20% in clinical status (pathogen present: 60%; pathogen absent: 40%) or lung consolidation (pathogen present: 60%; pathogen absent: 40%). Unfortunately, the prevalence of some pathogens was lower than expected, leading to the number of infected animals being <45 per group. This was especially important for all viruses, M. haemolytica, H. somni, and Mycoplasma. Therefore, although no association between these pathogens and ADG, clinical status, or lung consolidation was reported in this study, statistical power could have been insufficient in some cases (if the difference between 2 groups was the same as expected in sample size calculation) to support this lack of association with confidence. Also, results of the current study were obtained from herds recruited based on a high incidence BRD problems. Another limitation was the fact that it was a convenience sample of calves. However, in 10 herds, the sample represented all or most of the calves in the herd. In addition, the median age of the selected calves was similar to the median age of the median age of first treatment for BRD in a recent study.29 It is unclear if sampling herds with few or no respiratory problems or younger or older preweaned calves would have provided similar prevalence results for these pathogens. This situation deserves further assessment.",
