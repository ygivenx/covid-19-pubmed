Although an effective therapeutic strategy against SARS has yet to be developed, interferons (IFN) are recognized to play critical roles in host resistance to viral infection 3, 4, 5, 6, thereby implicating them as potential candidates for SARS CoV treatment. IFNs inhibit viral infection by directly interfering with viral replication and by inducing both an innate and adaptive immune response to infection. IFN-\u03b1s are effective in the treatment of hepatitis B and C 7, 8 and respiratory coronavirus infections unrelated to the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV 9, 10, 11, 12. IFN-\u03b1s and IFN-\u03b2 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and combinations of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 15, 18 are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Moreover, it was reported that macacque monkeys were protected from infection with SARS CoV by treatment with IFN-\u03b1 19.",

Based on these findings, a pilot study to evaluate the potential clinical benefit and safety of IFN alfacon-1 in SARS treatment was conducted by our laboratory. Patients treated with IFN alfacon-1 and corticosteroids had a shorter time to 50% resolution of lung radiographic abnormalities, better oxygen saturation, and resolved their need for supplemental oxygen more rapidly, when compared with a group receiving corticosteroids alone 23.",

High affinity binding of IFNs to IFNAR induces association of the two receptor chains and subsequent reciprocal transphosphorylation and activation of the associated Janus kinases (Jaks). The Jak-STAT (signal transducer and activator transcription) pathway induces IFN-mediated signal transduction and transcriptional activation, and is required for antiviral responses 25. In recent years it has become apparent that activation of the IFNR-associated Jaks also regulates multiple downstream signal transducing molecules, such as the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) 26, CrkL 27, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase 28, the protein kinase C family (PKC) 29, and the Vav proto-oncogene 30. Such signaling diversity is consistent with the pleiotropic biological effects of the IFNs in target cells and tissues 31.",

Phylogenetic data suggest that the SARS-CoV is a distinct group 2 coronavirus 35, 36. Previous studies have shown that IFNs-\u03b1/\u03b2 provide protection from MHV-A59 and MHV-2 infections in vivo\n37, 38. In ongoing experiments, we have evidence that MHV-1, when injected intra-nasally into mice, will induce a lung infection indistinguishable from that of the SARS-CoV infection in humans (G Levy et al., UHN, unpublished). Specifically, A/J mice are highly susceptible to intranasal infection with MHV-1, develop pulomonary disease characterized by marked pulmonary congestion, hyaline membranes, interstitial thickening and inflammation and alveolar exudates similar to SARS lung disease in humans. Accordingly, to understand the mechanism of action of IFN alfacon-1 in limiting SARS-CoV infection in humans, we developed an in vitro model system, using C3H murine L2 lung fibroblast cells, permissive for MHV-1 infection. In this report we provide evidence for the direct antiviral effects of IFN-\u03b1 against MHV-1 and identify several signaling effectors which mediate these effects. Additionally, by examining the changes in gene expression profiles in the PBMC of SARS patients who received IFN alfacon-1 treatment, we identify a subset of IFN-responsive genes whose differential expression may influence resolution of disease.",

To examine the influence of specific IFN activated signaling effectors in protection from MHV-1 infection, we studied the effects of a number of pharmacological inhibitors targeted against specific signaling molecules. High affinity binding of IFN to IFNAR leads to the phosphorylation-activation of the receptor-associated Jaks, Jak1 and Tyk2. L2 cells treated with the Jak1 inhibitor, Jak inhibitor 1, led to a reduction in IFN-\u03b14 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 (Figure 1C). Additionally, we observed a reduction in IFN-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 (Figure 1D). When L2 cells were treated with the Jak 1 inhibitor prior to IFN treatment, then infected with MHV-1, we observed a reduction in IFN-inducible protection from MHV-1 infection (Figure 1B). As a negative control, we examined the effect of the inhibitor AG490, which specifically inhibits Jak2 at 100 \u03bcM 45. As anticipated, treating cells with 100 \u03bcM AG490 did not influence the anti-MHV-1 activity of IFN-\u03b14 (Figure 1B).",

For comparison we measured gene expression in the PBMC of a SARS patient that was treated with corticosteroids alone (see Materials and Methods). PBMC were sampled on days 6, 8, 10 and 13 post-onset of symptoms. For the IFN-treated SARS patients, the day 6 PBMC sample represented a baseline in the absence of IFN treatment, whereas days 8, 10 and 13 corresponded to days 2, 4 and 7 relative to the start of IFN treatment. The data in Table 3 reveal 2 lists of genes expressed differentially between the 2 IFN-treated SARS patients and the 1 non-IFN treated patient, using a cut-off of \u2265 (A) or \u2264 (B) 3-fold change in expression, relative to basal expression levels on day 6 post-onset of symptoms. In Figure 3, differentially expressed genes are clustered to indicate high and low gene expression, using a red-green colour scale to show the relative range. Notably, our analyses identified 11 genes that were upregulated and 21 genes that were downregulated in the IFN-treated patients, according to these criteria. Upregulated genes included interleukin 8 (IL-8) and defensins alpha 1 and alpha 4. IL-8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils, induces neutrophil degranulation and enhances defensin release from neutrophils. Defensins are potent antimicrobial peptides that have been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against enveloped viruses and HIV 53, 54. Downregulated genes included protein-kinase repressor (PRKRIR), which acts to prevent PKR synthesis 55. Expression for exportin 1 (CRM1) was also downregulated in the PBMC of the IFN-treated SARS patients. CRM1 is a transport receptor that mediates nuclear export of proteins. CRM1 interacts with the Rev protein of HIV 56, suggestive of a potential for inhibition of nuclear activities associated with viral replication. Additionally, the expression of genes encoding RNA binding proteins and helicases including ELAV1, RNU22, DDX1 and DHX15 was also downregulated, in further support of inhibitory effects on viral replication intermediates. Interestingly, DDX1, a DEAD box protein, has been implicated in facilitating HIV replication57, 58. Viewed altogether, the implications are that IFN alfacon-1 treatment affected gene expression in the PBMC of SARS patients to promote direct antiviral effects and inhibit viral replication.",

Our findings suggest that Jak1, PKC\u03b4, and p38 MAPK play important roles in IFN-\u03b1-mediated anti-MHV-1 activity. At the lower doses of IFN-\u03b14, pre-treating the cells with Jak 1 inhibitor completely abrogated the protective effects of IFN-\u03b14. Since Jak1 activation is an early post-receptor activation event, it is not surprising that abrogating this upstream effector in the IFN-receptor signaling cascade has a profound effect on subsequent downstream signaling events and biological responses. By contrast, at the higher doses of IFN-\u03b14, inhibition of PKC\u03b4 inhibited IFN-induced antiviral activity to a greater extent, implying that STAT1-sensitive ISG activation is necessary for IFN-inducible anti-MHV-1 activity. Notably, IFN-\u03b14-induced antiviral activity is unlikely to be exclusively attributable to the activities of Jak1, p38 MAPK, and PKC\u03b4.",

We infer from these data that MHV-1 infection per se may prevent the activation of the IFN system. Indeed, many different viruses evade an immune response by interfering with transcriptional activation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes 59. Notably, in order to escape activation of the IFN system, the SARS-CoV appears to block a step after the early nuclear transport of IRF-3, the transcription factor essential for IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b14 promoter activity 60.",
