The family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales is divided into the four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Bats are the projected host reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are thought to be the host for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses [18]. The two betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS\u2013CoV), were transmitted by civet cats and camels, respectively, to humans, but they have shown limited capacity for adaptation to humans [16]. Some CoVs can be transmitted to different animal species, and subsequently adapt to and be maintained in the new host, because they can exploit or share a variety of host cell surface molecules or other undefined factors [16].",

            "text": "The species Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets [9]. For the last four decades, since the first appearance of PEDV in 1977, PEDV infection has resulted in significant economic losses in the European, Asian and US swine industries. PEDV has been found only within the pig population, indicating that the virus might have adapted only to pigs [9]. The species Porcine deltacoronavirus belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus. Porcine deltavoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel enteropathogenic CoV infecting pigs and was previously reported in birds [10]. PDCoV was first identified in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 [18] and the associated enteric disease was first reported in US swine only in early 2014 [17]. However, the origin of PDCoV infection in pigs and also the sudden emergence and route of introduction of this virus in the US remains unclear [10]. PDCoV may have only partially adapted to pigs and still retain some potential to infect different animal species, particularly poultry or other livestock, which can often have frequent contact with pigs in small-scale, backyard farms in the US. Therefore, our aim was to determine whether calves are susceptible to infection with either the newly emerged PDCoV or the swine enteric CoV, PEDV. Fecal virus shedding, seroconversion and histopathology were evaluated in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves orally inoculated with PDCoV or PEDV.",

Calves #1-4 were inoculated orally with 9.0-9.6 log10 GE of the OH-FD22-P5, and calves #5-7 were inoculated orally with 10.2-12.5 log10 GE of the PC21A (Table 1). After viral inoculation, we monitored clinical signs daily. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency as follows: 0=solid; 1=pasty; 2=semi-liquid; 3=liquid, with scores of 2 or more considered diarrheic. Calves #1 (PDCoV) and #5 (PEDV) were monitored for long-term clinical signs and virus shedding until post-inoculation day (PID) 16-17. The other inoculated or mock-infected calves were kept for short-term studies and were euthanized for histopathological examination at acute to mild stages (PIDs 3, 8 or 9) of viral infection (Table 1).\n",

The viral antigens expressed were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [2, 3, 12]. A multiplicity of infection of 0.1 was used for each viral inoculation in LLC-PK and Vero cells treated with 5 and 10 \u00b5g/ml of trypsin, respectively [2, 3, 12]. The cell culture conditions used to infect LLC-PK or Vero cells with each virus were described previously [2, 3, 12]. Characteristic cytopathic effects (CPE) [2, 3, 12] were monitored regularly in inoculated LLC-PK or Vero cells. When CPE was pronounced, PDCoV-inoculated LLC-PK (PID 1) and PEDV-inoculated Vero cells (PID 2) were fixed with 100% ethanol at 4\u00b0C overnight for IFA. The fixed cells were washed with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Blocking was performed with 1\u00d7 buffered solution of casein (10\u00d7 Power BlockTM Universal Blocking Reagent, Biogenx, CA, USA) in distilled water for 1 hr at room temperature. Four-fold serial dilutions, starting at 1:4, of the paired serum samples of calves #1 and #5, obtained at PID 0 and PID 16-17 were added to the wells and the plates were incubated overnight. Swine hyperimmune antiserum against PDCoV (1:100) or monoclonal antibody against the spike (S) protein of PEDV (6C8-1) (1:200), with the appropriate detection antibodies, were added to the wells as IFA positive controls [2, 3, 12]. Goat polyclonal antibodies specific for bovine, swine or mouse IgG (whole IgG) conjugated to fluorescein (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were diluted 1:100 in 0.01M PBS. The plates were incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. The stained plates were evaluated using a fluorescence microscope.

These observations are similar to a previous report showing that, human SARS-CoV strain Urbani, prior to its adaptation to mice (MA105 strain), replicated in the lungs of young mice, as indicated by their lung homogenates testing positive by qRT-PCR. However, the Urbani strain-inoculated mice did not show any clinical signs, but only mild histological lesions with low expression of viral antigens [13]. In our study, there were no detectable fecal viral RNA shedding, virus-specific serum IgG antibody responses, histological lesions, and clinical disease in Gn calves orally inoculated with the PEDV strain PC21A (ICs of wild-type PEDV-infected Gn pigs) [6]. For the past 40 years, PEDV has been found only within pigs, indicating that PEDV may have only adapted to pigs [9]. In contrast, PDCoV may not yet be completely adapted to pigs, and the disease caused by PDCoV has emerged only 2-3 years ago. PDCoV-infected pigs appeared to shed less PDCoV RNA and had a lower peak of viral titer in the feces, compared with experimental PEDV infections [7, 11], suggesting that there is a lower replication of PDCoV in the intestine of pigs, possibly due to its incomplete adaptation to pigs.",

The helicase and S genes of the CoVs isolated from the wild small mammals were closely related to those of PDCoV [18], suggesting that a potential interspecies transmission event may have occurred leading to DCoV transmission between wild small mammals and pigs. However, further studies are needed to define the potential role of small mammals as an intermediate host of PDCoV and the mechanisms of interspecies transmission of DCoVs between small mammals and domestic pigs or wild birds. Our data also support the potential ability of the newly emerged PDCoV to infect another animal species, such as cattle [16].

Based on our data, it is possible that interactions between PDCoV S protein and the host cell receptor or co-receptor binding may occur in the bovine intestine, whereas this may not be the case for PEDV S protein. The major cellular receptors of PEDV and PDCoV in pigs are unknown [10, 14]. The CoV S proteins can be divided into two functional subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 is involved in the receptor recognition and binding via the N-terminal or C-terminal virus receptor binding domains. Therefore, proteolysis between S1 and S2 is a critical determinant for CoV tropism and pathogenesis. The CoV S proteins can be cleaved by different animal proteases [15]. The extent of cleavage of PEDV and PDCoV S proteins might differ in the bovine intestine, possibly depending on their adaptation to the bovine intestinal environment; for example, exogenous proteolytic enzymes of bovine origin may influence PEDV or PDCoV S protein-host cell receptor binding. However, these assumptions should be verified by further studies.",

There were also no PDCoV RNA-positive nasal or serum samples from PDCoV-inoculated calf #1, indicating that PDCoV infection may be limited to the intestine, similar to PDCoV infections in pigs [10], although PDCoV-infected pigs also showed viremia (viral RNA in serum) [10]. Our study did not identify which type of cells in the intestines of inoculated calves could be the target for PDCoV replication, resulting in fecal shedding. Our IF staining experiments identified PDCoV antigen-positive cells in intestinal tissues from PDCoV-infected Gn pigs used as positive controls. Similar to the GIII.2 bovine norovirus (CV186-OH strain) that was shown to cause fecal virus RNA shedding in infected Gn calves, but in the absence of histological lesions or viral antigen/RNA in the intestine [5], PDCoV did not induce major histological changes in the intestine of Gn calves, such as necrosis of intestinal epithelium or villous atrophy. This result is also in line with data showing no PDCoV-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium. Based on these observations, PDCoV may have infected the intestine of calves as an attenuated virus that does not cause clinical disease and histological lesions, with low levels of viral antigen detected in enterocytes in inoculated animals. Nevertheless, our study did not clearly rule out an abortive infection with limited PDCoV replication in calves.",
