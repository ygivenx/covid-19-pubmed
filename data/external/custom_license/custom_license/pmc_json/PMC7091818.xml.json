Noone et al transfected the nasal epithelium of CF patients and was able to detect vector-specific DNA up to 10 days after gene transfer, but not mRNA or functional correction of the CFTR defect.1 The discrepancy between this trial and previously published nose trials that were able to detect CFTR mRNA and partial correction of the CFTR defect, is likely due to the lower transfection efficiency of the cationic lipid used. In a dose-escalating safety trial, liposome DNA complexes were aerosolised into the lungs of CF subjects, half of which, had a transient fever, muscle and joint pain shortly after liposome/DNA administration.2 This was attributed to an immunological response against the liposome/DNA complexes; similar results were previously reported in a lung trial, using the same liposome/DNA formulation. Interestingly, Hyde et al demonstrated for the first time, that liposome/DNA complexes could be successfully re-administered to the nose of CF patients. Each subject received three doses, administered 4 weeks apart and samples were analysed 4 days after each treatment. Six out of 10 treated subjects were positive for CFTR gene transfer after each dose.3",

In contrast to previous studies, the authors carefully determined that inefficient gene expression was due to the very low transduction efficiency of Ad in human airways. In addition, the vast majority of transfected cells (97%), did not appear to be epithelial cells.4 The authors therefore concluded that further improvements in Ad vector design are urgently required. An AAV2 vector was nebulised into the lung of CF subjects to assess delivery and safety. AAV2 administration to the lung appeared to be safe and vector genome was detected, at the highest dose, up to 30 days after administration. However, vector-specific mRNA could not be detected and therefore evidence for gene transfer was not provided.5",

For this purpose several very effective extracellular barriers, such as mucus, the gycocalyx, tight junctions and mucociliary clearance have evolved (Figure 1). Mucus, for example, reduces the transfection efficiency of most viral and non-viral gene transfer agents. However, transfection efficiency could be increased through pre-treatment with mucolytics or the antichiolinergic drug glycopyrolate in vitro and in vivo.6 In addition to mucus, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered from CF patients have been shown to inhibit liposome,7 adenovirus8 and AAV-mediated gene transfer efficiency.9 Although recombinant DNase reduced sputum viscoelasticity and improved nanosphere migration in vitro,10 the effect of DNase on gene transfer in vivo is unclear. To avoid the confounding effect of sputum in vivo, gene transfer should ideally be studied in CF children, before their lungs become filled with secretions. Indirect evidence has indicated, that the glycocalyx is also a barrier to gene transfer and that neuroaminidase enhances Ad transfection of polarised cells in vitro.11",

Most remarkably, it was demonstrated for the first time in vivo that CF-related secondary defects (nitric oxide synthase-2 and sodium hyper-absorption) were partially correctable through gene therapy as well.19 Targeting of sec-R has been successful in increasing airway gene transfer and several groups are currently trying to identify new peptides that bind to airway epithelial cells and promote targeted receptor-mediated endocytosis, using phage display libraries.20",

            "text": "As mentioned above, the density of receptors for Ad and AAV2 on the apical membrane of human airway epithelial cells is low, which explains in part the inefficient transfection efficiency. Multiple approaches have been studied to overcome this problem. Firstly, several new recombinant viruses have been identified, that appear to be able to enter epithelial cells via the apical membrane efficiently. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),21 Sendai virus (SeV)22 has recently been shown to transfect bronchial epithelial cells efficiently in vivo. Two days after infection with SeV 80% of airway epithelial cells expressed the \u03b2-galactosidase transgene (Figure 2a). SeV uses binding to cholesterol and sialic acid as receptors, which are both present at the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. In addition, SeV is not greatly inhibited by mucus. AAV entry into airway epithelial cells appears to be serotype-specific and AAV5 has been shown to transfect airway epithelial cells five times more efficiently than AAV2.2324 AAV in general is a very promising gene transfer agent. Not only does the virus maintain prolonged transgene expression due to integration or concatemerisation of the vector genome, but it is also thought that the virus might be less immunogenic, due to the fact that it does not appear to transduce antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Some reports have suggested that AAV could be repeatedly administered to the lung. However, this possibility has recently been ruled out unless different serotypes or some form of immunosuppression are used.25 An important limitation of AAV as gene transfer vector for CF has been its limited packaging capacity. However, it has recently been demonstrated that this problem can be overcome by using trans-splicing or overlapping vectors26 or by shortening the CFTR cDNA.27",

Glycoproteins from viruses that naturally infect the airway epithelial cells, such as human coronavirus 229E,31 influenza A strains32 and members of the Filovirus family, such as Marburg or Ebola virus, are good candidates. Pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors such as the human, feline or equine immunodeficiency virus is a particularly attractive approach. Lentiviral vectors have the ability to integrate into the genome of dividing and non-dividing, differentiated cells. Expression is therefore prolonged when compared with episomally maintained vectors and may last forever, if integration into a stem cell occurred. Kobinger et al have recently demonstrated that an Ebola-pseudotyped HIV vector efficiently transfects airway epithelial cells in vivo.33 Most interestingly, expression was low 7 days after administration, but strong expression was visible in airway epithelium and submucosal gland cells 28 days after transfection (30% tracheal epithelium expressed \u03b2-galactosidase). This persisted at least until day 63 (24% of the tracheal epithelium expressed a \u03b2-galactosidase reporter gene) Figure 2b. Currently large-scale, high titre production of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors is technically difficult and a critical limiting factor.",

Fox et al have recently demonstrated that \u2018naked\u2019 ODN are able to leave the bronchial circulation and transfect the cytoplasm, but not the nuclei of airway epithelial cells.50 In addition, Kohler et al have shown that i.v. injection of lipid-complexed \u03b2-galactosidase plasmids lead to expression in bronchial epithelium and tracheal submucosal glands of mice. However, this was only achieved with some, but not all of the cationic lipids tested.51 Importantly, in the past it has sometimes been difficult to discriminate recombinant from endogenous \u03b2-galactosidase expression and it is therefore important for these potentially exciting findings to be expanded upon.",

The possibility that in utero gene therapy would tolerise recipients to viral GTAs, has recently been ruled out.53 Larson et al have postulated a role for CFTR during development and provided preliminary evidence that transient expression of CFTR cDNA in utero alleviates the intestinal defect in the CF knockout mouse long term.5455 These controversial findings, if replicated, may have far reaching implications for traditional gene therapy approaches, as well as other areas of CF research.",

If successful, gene repair will ensure gene expression for the lifetime of the cells and appropriate control of gene expression will be guaranteed because the endogenous CFTR promoter is utilised. Preliminary results indicated that the genomic CFTR locus could be modified in primary rat hepatocytes using chimeraplasts (DNA/RNA hybrid oligonucleotides).56 Hepatocytes have previously been shown to be easily amenable for gene repair strategies, most likely due to efficient uptake of repair molecules into the nucleus. In addition, a similar approach using small fragment homologous recombination (SFHR) was able to reintroduce the wild-type CFTR sequence into the lungs of CF knockout mice, albeit at very low frequency.57 However, the specificity of targeted gene repair is currently unknown.",

Gersting et al60 recently reported that application of a magnetic field to human primary airway epithelial cells transfected with plasmid DNA mixed with superparamagnetic nanoparticles (magnetofection) resulted in more than 100-fold increase in gene transfer. Stem cell-based gene therapy approaches are also being investigated. Two strategies can be envisaged: either targeting lung-resident stem cells with integrating vectors or engineering bone marrow/embryonic cells ex vivo and inducing engraftment into the airway epithelium. Thus, bone marrow-derived stem cells have recently been observed to diferentiate into airway epithelial cells in the lung.61 Prolonged and sustained CFTR expression may not be beneficial, especially if integrating vectors are used. To this end, epithelium-specific regulated cassettes are being developed.62 Each of the vectors and technologies will have to be tested in relevant in vivo models. Ideally, in contrast to CF mice, these would reproduce the lung pathology seen in CF patients. For this reason efforts are being made to develop a CF ferret63 and a CF sheep,64 their lung biology being more similar to humans than the mouse. Finally new imaging techniques to monitor the efficiency of gene transfer in living animals/patients will also have to be developed. In addition to positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based strategies, laser-induced fluorescence bronchoscopy65 has recently been developed as a way to detect gene expression in a non-invasive way in human airways.",
