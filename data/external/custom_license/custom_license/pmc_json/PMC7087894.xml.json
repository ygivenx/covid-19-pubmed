The two complications included in this analysis\u2014bronchitis and pneumonia\u2014were chosen because of their strong association with influenza, their high incidence, and their applicability to the chosen population group [20]. The model assumes that individuals can develop only a single complication. The underlying data from epidemiological studies provide the incidence of each complication. There is no published information on whether some individuals in the study population had more than one complication at a time. It is assumed that each reported complication occurred in a different patient. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors is assumed to have an effect on the incidence of complications but not on the course of these. This means baseline (usual care) and interventions (neuraminidase inhibitors) have the same probabilities for hospitalization and mortality due to bronchitis or pneumonia once these complications develop. Due to limited data availability further assumptions have been made: no hospitalization is assumed for bronchitis and the mortality rate due to a complication is not lower than that of influenza in itself. The impact of the uncertainty surrounding the data used for these variables (probability of complication, hospitalization, mortality) is determined in probabilistic sensitivity analysis (second-order Monte Carlo simulation).",

A comprehensive United States database [National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)] has been used to develop estimates of the resource use of each complication, including GP and specialist visits, tests and investigations, and drugs [10]. Data to this level of detail were not available specifically for the UK. The NAMCS data provide rates of drug prescribing by complication as well as drug class. Overall rates of antibiotic prescribing in the NAMCS database were strikingly similar to published estimates in the UK. For example, Meier et al. [1] reported that approx. 80% of complicated influenza cases in the UK are treated with an antibiotic; the NAMCS estimate was 83%. For uncomplicated influenza cases the rates were 40% and 36%, respectively. Productivity loss was valued by applying the human capital approach thus using the time to return to normal activity (days) as evaluated in epidemiological studies and clinical trials and valuing the time with the average gross UK income.",

This means the patients not returning to normal activity within 21 days were censored.

QALYs were generated by recalibrating the Roche Likert score to mean vsual analogue scale (VAS) scores and then transforming them to time trade-off equivalent scores (for a description of the transformation see [15]). The relative improvement for an otherwise healthy adult population was applied to the generic influenza quality weight [22] to derive a quality weight for ILI for patients effectively treated with oseltamivir.

This means that in addition to allowing for variability due to the way in which individuals travel through the model (first-order Monte Carlo simulation) the underlying model variables are allowed to vary over a given range with a given distribution. For each simulation run a value from the distribution of each variable is picked at random, generating one set of outputs (costs and effectiveness). A large number of simulation runs therefore yields a distribution of outputs [25]. Because of their possible impact and the uncertainty surrounding them certain variables were chosen from predefined distributions: probabilities (complication, hospitalization, mortality) and duration (days to return to normal activity, length of stay in hospital). Beta distributions (probabilities) and gamma distributions (duration) were used. Each of the 10,000 patients randomly traverses a single path through the model. The model is recalculated 100 times. Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses are provided of additional costs and additional health outcomes associated with the scenarios compared.",

For comparison these costs were also excluded in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Most costs and effects related to influenza occur within 1 year but some occur in the future (years of life lost due to premature death).

One-way sensitivity analyses are presented for two variables that are generally believed to have a major impact on the results: diagnostic certainty and time of treatment start after onset of symptoms. Diagnostic certainty describes the percentage of influenza-positive patients within the ILI population, which is presumably higher when influenza is circulating. For the base case scenario diagnostic certainty is assumed to be 70% (point estimate). This assumption was made based on a diagnostic certainty rate of around 67% observed in oseltamivir clinical trials [30]. Drawing on analyses published for the zanamivir technology assessment, 34% was chosen as a low estimate of diagnostic certainty in sensitivity analysis [19]. Since time of treatment start should be within 48 h of onset of symptoms for treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors to be effective, the assumption is made that only patients having a GP consultation within this period receive the neuraminidase inhibitors. In sensitivity analysis the impact of a proportion of patients receiving the neuraminidase inhibitors after 48 h of symptoms was evaluated. Clinical trials are likely to have controlled for this factor already to some extent. However, the impact of 25% of patients receiving treatment in excess of 48 h after symptom onset was tested. This represents an arbitrary proportion of late presenters receiving treatment, but helps to demonstrate the sensitivity of results to this variable.",

The impact of a lower level of diagnostic certainty upon the incremental cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir was compared to usual care (see Table 4). For the NHS perspective the analyses demonstrate that the results are very sensitive to the level of diagnostic certainty assumed. As the level of diagnostic certainty is reduced, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for oseltamivir increase. This can also be seen in a shift of the cost-acceptability curve to the right (see Fig. 3). However, oseltamivir remains cost-effective in terms of the incremental cost per QALY gained from the healthcare payer\u2019s perspective at a threshold of 30,000/QALY gained and dominant from the societal perspective even assuming 34% diagnostic certainty.",

However, our review of the literature suggests that actual knowledge about influenza and its consequences on health, healthcare resource use, and the economy are limited. As part of our model we tried to capture relevant published knowledge about the disease and its implications. However, in the context of decision making about providing treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza it is important to understand that the results presented here are conditional on the baseline probabilities used in the model. Our model is subject to a number of limitations. In general, there is a lack of accurate information about influenza complication, mortality, and hospitalization rates in the otherwise healthy adult population. All baseline probabilities for influenza complications, mortality, and hospitalization are from rather few publications due to the relatively limited knowledge of the true complication and mortality rates associated with influenza. Also worth noting is that the baseline probabilities are based on ILI and not confirmed influenza cases. If it had been possible to filter out ILI cases due to other pathogens (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzavirus, coronavirus) from true influenza cases, the baseline probabilities would most likely be higher. Despite the availability of rapid influenza tests, testing is not routinely carried out as it is not cost-effective [32]. The baseline probabilities reflect the influenza seasons in which the studies were conducted (all of which were interpandemic seasons). This means that in the case of a particularly strong influenza epidemic, or a pandemic, the baseline incidence rates of complications, mortality and hospitalization would probably be substantially higher, as would be the certainty of diagnosis [33]. Hence the resulting cost-effectiveness of treatment would be even more favorable (assuming the same treatment effect). Due to data limitations we also did not include hospitalizations due to bronchitis, nor did we include certain other secondary complications (e.g., asthmatic exacerbations or cardiac events). However, the exclusion of all of these events from our model is likely to generate conservative estimates of the benefits of influenza treatment.",

On the other hand, the model captures as much of the influenza illness as possible given the published data and uses probabilistic modeling taking into account the uncertainty pertaining to the complication, hospitalization, and mortality rates and durations (days to return to normal activity, length of stay in hospital) that drives the dynamics of influenza and influenza treatment.",

Research has shown that standard gamble scores are higher than time trade-off scores, which are higher than visual analogue scores [26]. Biases that have been reported related to rating scales are the end-of-scale bias (subjects tend not to use the ends of the scale) and the spacing out bias (subjects tend to space out the outcomes over the scale) [26]. However, the rating scale method is a widely accepted method for measuring patient\u2019s preferences as it is quick and efficient.

Several methods for estimating confidence intervals for cost-effectiveness ratios have been proposed, each posing methodological challenges. One of the alternative approaches is the use of acceptability curves, which are also presented for our analysis. Assuming that the cost-effectiveness ratio is symmetrical, the 50% point corresponds to the point estimate of the cost-effectiveness ratio. Furthermore, when the curves increase monotonically, cutting 2.5% from either end of the vertical axis and using the curve to map these values on to the horizontal axis defines the 95% confidence interval. However, a limitation to this method is that preferences for gains and losses are in fact not symmetrical, i.e., the 50% point would not correspond to the mean value of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [34].",
