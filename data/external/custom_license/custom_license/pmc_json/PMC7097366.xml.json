Many human pathogens show preferential, often exclusive, tropism for human cells and do not replicate in experimental animals. In this issue, Wahl et al.1 provide mouse models to study respiratory pathogens, which are the leading cause of death by infectious disease globally and the fourth most common cause of death overall. The mice carry both human fetal lung tissue and a humanized immune system, allowing the study of pathogen replication in human cells from the respiratory tract and of human immune responses to the pathogens in an animal model. They are especially suited to the investigation of pathogens targeting cells from the lower respiratory tract, particularly pathogens for which no relevant animal models exist, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which replicates only in humans.",

Several mouse strains are available that support engraftment of human umbilical cord blood, mobilized blood, bone marrow and fetal tissues such as liver and thymus2,3. Human hematopoietic stem cells are typically engrafted in strains that lack or have inactivating mutations in genes required for rearrangement of T cell and B cell receptor genes (e.g., recombinase activating genes (Rag) or the DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (Prkdc)) and in the \u03b3 common chain of the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (IL2R), which is critical for development of natural killer cells. All these strains lack mouse T cells, B cells and innate lymphoid cells, including natural killer cells. A frequently used strain, which is also used by Wahl et al.1, is a non-obese diabetic\u2013severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) strain with a Prkdc mutation and an IL2R\u03b3 deficiency, called NSG mice.",

Using an elegant technology called acoustic angiography, they demonstrate the occurrence of active angiogenesis in and around the implants.

If the mice support somatic hypermutation, this would represent an important advance because thus far high-affinity, class-switched, antigen-specific antibodies have rarely been produced in humanized mouse models. There are several possible reasons for this. One is that the host strains of HIS and BLT mice have only a few secondary lymph nodes owing to a lack of IL2Ry-dependent lymphoid tissue inducer cells. Another is that there is a suboptimal interaction of B cells and T cells caused by a lack of cross-reactivity on the part of critical cytokines involved in this interaction. Also, non-hematopoietic cells important for B cell maturation are of mouse origin and do not appropriately interact with maturing B cells. This may also be a reason for the lack of structured germinal centers in immunized HIS and BLT mice.",
