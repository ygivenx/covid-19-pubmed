            "text": "The bats (order Chiroptera) are the second largest order of mammals, with 1150 species (www.iucnredlist.org). The order Chiroptera is divided into two suborders, Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, according to morphological, behavioral, and molecular evidence. The Yinpterochiroptera includes rhinolophoid microbats and the megabats (pteropodids), while the other bats are seen as part of Yangochiroptera (Lei and Dong 2016; Teeling et al. 2005). Previous studies have shown that bats are natural reservoirs of a large number of viruses (Han et al. 2015). Approximately 150 viruses have been found in bats (Luis et al. 2013, Supplementary data). Many of these viruses can cause illness and mortality in humans and other animals. Many infectious diseases outbroke in recent years were considered to originate from bats, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes coronavirus (SARS-CoV; which caused a pandemic in 2002\u20132003) (Xing-Yi et al. 2013), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; which was reported in 2013) (Wang et al. 2014), and the Ebola virus (the culprit of the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa in 2014) (Leroy et al. 2005). Remarkably, bats that carry viruses usually do not have biological lesions (Halpin et al. 2000; Leroy et al. 2005; Towner et al. 2007). Moreover, these bats did not develop overt clinical signs after experimental infection with Hendra and Nipah viruses (Middleton et al. 2007; Williamson et al. 2000). To date, only the lyssavirus and Tacaribe virus (not zoonotic disease) were found to cause clinical signs of disease in bats (Ann et al. 2012; Johnson et al. 2008). It seems that these bat-associated viruses cause little damage in bats themselves. We speculate that the bats have evolved certain mechanisms to prevent viral infection and control viral reproduction.",

Among these PRRs, the TLRs have been most extensively studied. The TLRs represent the first line of defense against pathogens and survey the extracellular and endosomal compartments. Structure of TLRs consists of a signal peptide, an N-terminal ligand recognition ectodomain (ECD), a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain that binds signaling molecules and initiates innate cellular immune responses. The ectodomain is composed of 19\u201326 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which are ligand-binding domains, capped with the N- and C-terminal ends (LRR-NT and LRR-CT motifs) (Botos et al. 2011; Tanji et al. 2013).",

Generally, TLR2 is activated by gram-positive bacterial lipoteichoic acid and GPI anchors of parasitic protozoans. TLR4 is well known for its critical role in the control of gram-negative bacterial infection by recognizing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Recently, TLR2 and TLR4 are reported to mediate the cellular responses to virus infection by recognizing glycoproteins (Blanco et al. 2010; Boehme et al. 2006; Jude et al. 2003; Karen et al. 2002; Murawski et al. 2009; Rassa et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2011). TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the intermediate produced during the replication of most viruses. TLR7 and TLR8 recognize viral ssRNA. TLR9 detects unmethylated CpG motifs that are found in certain dsDNA viral, bacterial and protozoan genomes (Bowie 2007; Gupta et al. 2015; Thompson and Iwasaki 2008; Thompson et al. 2011).",

To detect the selection pressure acting on bats, we performed a two-ratio model (model M2) and labeled the clade of Chiroptera as the foreground \u03c9 (\u03c9\n1) and the rest of the mammals as the background \u03c9 (\u03c9\n0). The foreground \u03c9\n1 represented the average \u03c9 over all branches and sites within bats. The results gave an estimate that both of the foreground and background \u03c9 were 0.26 (Table 2). Model M2 did not fit the data better than model M0 (P = 1.00 > 0.05, Table 2). In addition, the average \u03c9 of bats was significantly smaller than one (model M2\u2032, P = 2.81 \u00d7 10\u221213 < 0.05). The small value of \u03c9 showed the domination of purifying selection in the evolution of mammalian and bat TLR3.

However, none of the branches was positively selected in bats (Fig. 1). Again, the M2\u2033 was not a better fit than model M2 (P = 0.092 > 0.05, Table 2).

In most molecular taxonomic studies, Eulipotyphla is consistently placed at the root of Laurasiatheria while the relationships of Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, and Chiroptera are inconsistent and weakly supported (Nery et al. 2012; Nishihara et al. 2006; Prasad et al. 2008). The gene tree of TLR3 corresponded to the mammalian species tree (Fig. 1). As for TLR7, the phylogeny also similar to the species tree with a slight difference in the place of Eulipotyphla (Fig. 2). The gene tree of TLR8 showed some difference compared with the species tree (Fig. 3). However, the most different signals occurred in the phylogeny of TLR9 (Fig. 4). This pattern was also observed in a previous study (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015). The difference between the phylogeny of TLR9 and mammalian species tree might be a consequence of the accumulation of positively selected branches and sites. However, the relationships within bats were consistent among TLRs.",

            "text": "However, there was not any specific branch or site detected under positive selection in bat TLR3. This result is inconsistent with the description of a previous study (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015). In the previous study, they gave an estimate of \u03c9 = 1 for the bat clade for the reason that the LRT between models M1 and M2 was significant (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015). Actually, their model M1 is equivalent to model M2\u2032 in the present study, while their model M2 is the same with our study. Because of the significance of LRT between models M2 and M2\u2032 the null hypothesis (\u03c9 = 1 for the bat clade, M2\u2032) should be rejected. Namely, our results based on branch specific models for TLR3 actually is consistent with the work of Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015). Moreover, plus the result of another LRT that model M2 did not significantly different with model M0, it could be concluded that the TLR3 evolved under purifying selection based on the results of branch specific models. In the site-specific models, Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015) showed that the LRT comparing models M8a and M8 was significant and detected six positively selected sites in bat TLR3. When we checked their result file of model M8, these sites were only selected by Naive Empirical Bayes (NEB) analysis but not selected by BEB analysis with P > 95% (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015). As for mammals, five positively selected sites were detected (Table S7). One positively selected site (87T) coincided with the dsRNA-TLR3 interaction sites (Liu et al. 2008), which suggested that this site had an important role in recognizing viruses for mammals. The positively selected sites 4N and 507H were also detected by Areal et al. (2011). However, the difference was that we did not detect any sites in the transmembrane and TIR domains in mammals. What is more, the five positively selected sites in mammals were detected to have a low value of \u03c9 in bat TLR3 (Table S7). These outcomes suggested the function conservation in bat TLR3. The crystal structure of complex between dsRNA and TLR3-ECD shows that the ectodomain of TLR3 interacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone of dsRNA, but not with individual bases, which explains the lack of specificity for nucleotide sequences in TLR3 (Liu et al. 2008). Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the conservation of bat TLR3. In the other hand, the high conservation of bat TLR might be driven primarily by the pressure to maintain the signaling networks to binding with accessory receptor molecules and signaling intermediates (Kawasaki and Kawai 2014) rather than by the pressure of virus.",

This result is consistent with previous study for the same reason analyzed for TLR3 (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015). Moreover, the bat ancestor was detected to be under positive selection for TLR7. This was also proved by a study of comparative analysis of bat genomes (Zhang et al. 2013). We identified only one positively selected site (303N) located in LRR, the ligand-binding domains for TLR7 (Botos et al. 2011). However, this site was not in compliance with the site descripted by Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015). The unique positively selected site for TLR7 detected by Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015) (391Q) was also detected in model M8 (394N in the present study) with P (\u03c9 > 1) = 0.957 (Table 4). However, P (\u03c9 > 1) for 394N was low in model M2. This outcome might be a consequence of adding more bat species. However, the positively selected sites identified in mammalian and bat TLR7 were not overlapped (Table S7). These results implied the important role of the positively selected site (303N) in virus adaptation of bats. In addition, the number of positively selected sites in mammals was similar with previous study of mammalian TLR7 with less species (Areal et al. 2011). However, the crystal structure of TLR7 and ligand-binding site in TLR7 has not been resolved yet.",

One of them was the ancestor of R. hipposideros, R. ferrumequinum, and R. euryale, which was also detected for episodic positive selection previously (Schad and Voigt 2016). The other one, the ancestor of Nyctalus spp. and P. nathusii, was first detected in the present. Additionally, one single terminal species, N. leporinus was also detected for strong positive selection. The common element among TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 was that the bat ancestor was positively selected in the long-term evolution, which was also detected by Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015). However, in a similar study for TLR8, the ancestor of bats was not detected (Schad and Voigt 2016). In the site models, 675R was specifically selected in bats while the other four positively selected sites were consistent between bats and mammals (Table 4). This specific site for bat TLR8 was also detected by Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015) (666C). Moreover, all of these selected sites were located in LRRs, indicating their important role in recognizing pathogens (Botos et al. 2011). Sironi et al. (2015) showed that some of the positively selected sites for mammalian TLR4 match to the structure differences between human and mice which is another kind of virus reservoir. The similar phenomenon was also found in bat TLR8 that 419K, 479T, and 606V were located in the LRRs involved in ligand recognition according to the crystal structure of human TLR8 (Tanji et al. 2013).",

            "text": "For TLR9, seven branches within Chiroptera were under positive selection according to this study, while only Myotis showed an estimate of \u03c9 > 1 in the study by Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015). Furthermore, the number of positively selected sites identified in this study was significantly higher than that in previous studies. In the most related studies, four positively selected sites were identified, while fourteen sites were detected in this study (Areal et al. 2011; Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015). Of particular interest, six of these positively selected sites were specific in bats (Table 4). Among them, 325T and 355S were also identified by Escalera-Zamudio et al. (2015) (302S and 332W). Remarkably, all of the positively selected sites were located in LRR domains. According to the results from crystal structure of mammalian TLR9, ligands were recognized by LRRNT\u2013LRR10 and LRR20\u2013LRR22 (Ohto et al. 2015). Half of the positively selected sites for TLR9 were located in these regions. The specific positively selected sites may contribute to the high tolerance of viruses in bats especially 325T, 326R, and 651K, which were located in the ligand-binding regions. The high proportion of positively selected sites and branches in bat TLR9 has never been identified. This result may be a consequence of the larger samples affected by different pathogens, for the fact that all the bats added in this study have been reported as hosts from which viruses were isolated (Luis et al. 2013). The other reason lies on the recognition of TLR9. TLR9 not only recognizes virus DNA but also detects bacterial and protozoan genomes with unmethylated CpG motifs (Bowie 2007; Gupta et al. 2015; Thompson and Iwasaki 2008; Thompson et al. 2011). However, the known ligand-TLR9 interaction sites are studied from a few specific ligands (Ohto et al. 2015; Tanji et al. 2013). The identification of the exact interaction sites between the virus and TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 is still in progress. The positively selected sites identified in this study could constitute a potential target for investigating bat viral resistance, especially the sites specifically detected in bat TLRs.",

            "text": "In conclusion, bat TLR3 evolved completely under purifying selection. Although the negative selection has been acting dominantly on TLRs, positively selected signals were present in bat TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. Weak negative selection of TLRs is consistent with selection to conserve important binding specificities such as the conservation of interactive region in TLR3 (Liu et al. 2008). The bat TLR9 showed the strongest positive selection both in branch and site models. The bat ancestor has experienced positive selection in the evolution of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. The positive selection for bat TLRs was a consequence of adaptation to pathogen-host interaction, especially in TLR9. Additionally, the nucleic viruses usually evolve rapidly (Domingo and Perales 2014) while the nucleic sensing TLRs show slow evolution and divergence (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015). Therefore, we propose that the selection of TLRs was a combination of functional conservation and the pressure of viruses. However, we did not detect any positive selection branches in rodents, another virus reservoir (Luis et al. 2013). Therefore, other mechanisms must exist to explain the virus tolerance of bats in addition to the TLRs. A further survey of the selective evolution of other types of pathogen recognized receptor genes in bats need to be elucidated to better understand the ability of viral resistance in bats.",
