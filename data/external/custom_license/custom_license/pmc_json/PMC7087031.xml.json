            "text": "The H9N2 influenza virus is a pandemic threat according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Since the H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) was first isolated and characterized in 1966 in turkeys [1], birds, including wild birds and domestic poultry populations, became the main victims of this virus [2\u20135]. This subtype AIV occurred mainly in Asia causing low mortality and immunosuppression in chickens and a decline in egg production [6, 7]. The Middle East, Africa and other non-Asian countries also reported outbreaks [5, 8, 9]. Recently, reports showed that this subtype of avian influenza virus has been transmitted from birds to dogs and cats, pigs and non-primate animals [10\u201313]. More importantly, the human cases of H9N2 influenza virus infection occurred with the clinical signs of mild respiratory tract inflammation in China [14]. The seroprevalence of avian influenza H9N2 in humans showed that it is trending toward a more prevalent pathogen in human populations [15]. The most important feature of this subtype AIV is that it provided the inner genes to other AIV types to form a new epidemic influenza virus. Reports showed that the avian influenza virus H9N2 provided its six inner genes to H7 subtype to form a new H7N9 virus which can infect and kill humans [16]. The latest H10N8 virus, which can be fatal to humans, also includes six inner genes of H9N2 [17]. There are evidences showed that the H9N2 avian influenza virus can, as reassortants, give its PB1 [18] or non-structure (NS) gene [19] to high pathogenic H5N1 AIV. H9N2 often co-exists and co-circulates with the other AIV types during their prevalence, such as its coexistence with the H7N9 [20] and H5N1 [4].",

            "text": "The mechanism regarding enhanced pathogenicity of the H9N2 virus in mice is still less known and remains to be determined [21]. Our previous reports showed that a single amino acid substitution in PB2 residue 627 changed the virulence of H9N2 avian influenza virus in mice [22, 23]. Similar to most pathogens, the clinical course induced by influenza virus was determined by the struggle between the virulence of the virus and the reaction of the host. To date, the host factors which play the role against the H9N2 subtype influenza virus is still obscure. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein families are activated in response to viral infections and represent a new class of cellular restriction factors that block the replication of pathogens and its pathogenesis [24]. The average size of IFITM proteins including IFITM1\u2013IFITM5 are 130 amino acids and share a topology defined by a conserved CD225 domain [24, 25], consisting of two intramembrane (IM) regions and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL). One or more IFITM proteins can be constitutively expressed in specific cells and tissues [25], such as a wide range of human tissues expressing IFITM1\u2013IFITM3, while IFITM5 is expressed only in osteoblasts [26]. Potentially, this constitutive expression pattern of IFITM can provide the first line of defense against virus infection [26]. Increasingly, reports showed that IFITM offers protection against numerous viruses, including Influenza A, Rift Valley fever virus, SARS coronavirus, filoviruses, Dengue and HIV, through several routes, including inhibiting formation of a fusion pore between the virus and endosomal membranes [26\u201329]. In mouse models, IFITM3 has been shown to have the most antiviral activity of the IFITM class for the viruses investigated and restricted in influenza A virus infection [30]. IFITM1 also showed antiviral activity against Influenza A and hepatitis C virus [31, 32]. When the infection of influenza virus occurred, the expression profile of IFITM1 and IFITM3 and histological distribution are not clear.",

When the mice were inoculated with 106 EID50 VK627, they will dead at 6 dpi [23], but mice only showed the greatest signs of illness, such as ruffled fur and severe morbidity (weight loss as a measure of morbidity) were inoculated with 104 PFU of VK627 [22]. Compared with VK627, rVK627E showed low pathogenicity and is non-lethal to mice [22, 23]. So, in this research, the mice were inoculated with 104 PFU of VK627 or rVK627E. Thirty-six SPF female BALB/c mice (18.0\u201320.0 g, 6\u20138 weeks) from the Guangdong Experimental Animal Centre (Guangzhou, China) were randomly divided into three groups and set for sampling three every group every time point. After being anesthetized with CO2, the mice were inoculated intranasally with 50\u00b5l of sterile, endotoxin-free PBS containing 104 PFU of VK627 or rVK627E influenza virus; the mice in control were treated only by PBS. All mice were weighed before challenging and surveyed for daily weight loss as a measure of morbidity.",

Relative expression levels of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were determined by real-time PCR using DNA Engine 7500 Continuous Fluorescence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM Kit (Takara Biotech, Dalian, China).

The primer sequences were synthesized as follows: 5\u2032-GAAGATGGTGGGTGATACGA-3\u2032 (IFITM1-Fw), 5\u2032-GCAG CGATAGACAAGGAAAC-3\u2032(IFITM1-Rv), 5\u2032-GCCCCCAACTACGAAAGA-3\u2032 (IFITM3-Fw), 5\u2032-ATTGAACAGGGACCAGACCAC-3\u2032(FITM3-Rv), 5\u2032-CATCCGTAAAGACCTCTATGCCA-3\u2032 (\u03b2-actin-Fw) and 5\u2032-ATGGAGCCACCGATCCACA-3\u2032 (\u03b2- actin-Rv). The melting curves for each PCR were carefully analyzed to avoid nonspecific amplifications in PCR products. The relative expression level of IFITM1 and IFITM3 was calculated by normalizing the levels of gene transcripts to that of \u03b2-actin transcripts using a relative standard curve method through 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct formula. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). One-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance between samples in relative expression levels of IFITM1 and IFITM3. A P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, while a P < 0.01 was considered to be highly significant.",

            "text": "Immunohistochemical detection was performed to show the distribution of the IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins in the tissues of infected and control mice (Figs. 3, 4). In the lung, the IFITM1 positive cells are mainly the epithelial cells of the pulmonary alveoli in the control group mice, while both VK627- and rVK627E-infected mice all showed stronger positives in the epithelial cells of the pulmonary alveoli as well as the epithelial cells and the submucosa of bronchi and bronchioles. Notably, the shed bronchial epithelial cells, intraluminal secretions and infiltration cells in the alveolar wall and around the bronchi and bronchioles are strong positives (Fig. 3a\u2013c). The distribution, in the lungs, of IFITM3 positive cells is similar to that of IFITM1 (Fig. 4a\u2013c). For the heart, whether the myocardial cells were in the control, VK627 or rVK627E group, all showed positive for IFITM1 (Fig. 3d\u2013f). The IFITM3 in the muscle cells of the heart was negative in the control group, but positive cells are distributed in the infected groups, with the VK627 infection group having more positive focal distribution than the rVK627E infection group (Fig. 4d\u2013f). A similar situation occurred in the liver, but no difference between VK627 and rVK627E infection groups was seen for IFITM3 (Fig. 4g\u2013i). Meanwhile the liver cells of the control group were positive for IFITM1 in the cell membrane. The control and the rVK627E groups are similar except that the strong positive cells are concentrated around the central vein in the rVK627E group. All liver cells showed strong positive for IFITM1 in the VK627 group (Fig. 3g\u2013i). In the spleen, the IFITM1 positive cells are diffusely distributed in the whole splenic corpuscle for the control group, but the VK627 and rVK627E groups have more positive cells (Fig. 3j\u2013l). For IFITM3 expression, the focal lymphocytes in the splenic corpuscle are positive and there are more lymphocytes which showed as stronger positives in the infected groups. Reticuloendothelial cells also showed strong positives in the infected groups but are negative in mice of the control group (Fig. 4j\u2013l). In the kidney, the endothelial cells of some renal tubules were moderately positive for IFITM1 and IFITM3 and some cells in the glomerulus were positive for IFITM1. There were more strongly positive endothelial cells of the renal tubules in the VK627 group than in the rVK627E group for both ITITM1 and IFITM3 (Figs. 3, 4m\u2013o). Notably, some cells in the glomerulus were more positive in the VK627 and rVK627E groups than in the control group for IFITM1 (Fig. 3m\u2013o). In the brain, some of the cortical neurons showed moderately positive for IFITM1 with the infected groups having more strongly positive neurons, especially strongly positive infiltrated glial cells (Fig. 3p\u2013r). IFITM3 showed similar results as IFITM1 (Fig. 4p\u2013r).\n\n",

            "text": "Mice are the routine model animals for studying influenza virus, previous researches showed that H9N2 AIVs can cause severe respiratory disease in experimentally infected mice without prior adaptation is increasing [6, 22, 35]. However, the basic data about the expression profile and tissue-specific distribution about the host factors during H9N2 avian influenza virus infection still obscure. The PB2 residue 627 in H9N2 AIV, A/chicken/Guangdong/V/2008, is the factor to determine its virulence [22], its relationship with the host response also needs to be known. In mouse models, both IFITM1 and IFITM3 show antiviral and restriction activity in IAV infection [30\u201332]. In this research, IFITM1 and IFITM3 showed different tissue-specific expression patterns during H9N2 influenza virus infection. The lung is the most important replication site of the avian influenza virus in mouse [30, 36, 37] and host IFITM restriction is the most critical antiviral factor. For 5 days after infection, which has been proved as an important replication stage for the H9N2 AIV viruses [22, 23], the expression of IFITM3 in VK627 infected samples is continuously increasing, while continuously decreasing in rVK627E infected tissues, suggesting that the host antivirus response was consistent with the virus replication. The expression pattern of IFITM1 showed distinct differences compared with IFITM3 in the VK627 infection and showed a similar pattern in rVK627E infection. The most obvious difference is that VK627 infection can induce non-suppurative encephalitis, while rVK627E infection cannot [22, 23]. IFITM3 were at low expression levels in brain tissue infected with VK627, but were significantly higher (3 dpi) when infected by rVK627E. This may suggest that a glutamic acid residue (E) in position 627 stimulate a host antiviral response in the brain. In the other tissues, the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were different for the various tissues. In the clinical course, some of them showed pathological changes, such as very slight lymphocytic myocarditis seen only in VK627 infection. The results of distinct expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM3 are consistent with previous research [28\u201331]. This may be correlated with the expression trends of the IFITM1 and IFITM3 in infected course. In our research, we also detected the relative expression levels of IFITM2, which are much lower than IFITM1 and IFITM3, except for brain, where the expression pattern roughly follows the expression of IFITM3 (Fig. S1). In order to elucidate the role of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the different tissues, further research will be required.",

Because the high degree of similarity of IFITM2 and IFITM3 [39], polyclonal antibody raised against IFITM3 will also be recognize IFITM2. For the most of the tissues analyzed with low expression levels, the antibody of IFITM3 detected protein is very likely IFITM3, but in brain, it maybe IFITM2/IFITM3. For the cell- and tissue-specific distribution of IFITM3 in lung and spleen, our results are consistent with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected mice [40]. The results of immunohistochemical detection of the lung are consistent with those of the previous report on acute influenza virus-infected mice [28].
