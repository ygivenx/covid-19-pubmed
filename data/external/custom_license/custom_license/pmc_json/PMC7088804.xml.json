            "text": "Production of type I interferon (IFN) is a key step in the innate immune response to viral infection. Two major pathways are employed for the activation of type I interferon following virus infection. The first one is toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent pathway, for example, TLR3 can detect viral dsRNAs in endosomal compartments. The second one is RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-dependent pathway, in which cytoplasmic CARD domain-containing RNA helicases, RIG-I and MDA5, can sense viral RNA in the cytoplasm. Both pathways are based on sensor interactions with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as double stranded RNA accumulated during replication or released upon lysis of infected cells, or structured single-stranded RNAs of the viral genome. Two different groups of adaptors are utilized in the two pathways. The TLRs signal through TRIF and/or MyD88, whereas RLRs signal through MAVS/IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF. Downstream of the different adaptors, IKK\u03b5 and TBK1, are recruited and ultimately IRF-3, NF\u03baB, and AP-1 are activated to initiate type I IFN gene transcription. Once interferon is synthesized and released from cells, it binds to interferon receptors, initiating a signaling cascade of JAK/STAT pathway that results in the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which enable the cell to combat viral infection and interfere with viral replication.",

These results indicate that N blocks a very early step for IFN-\u03b2 production, most probably at the RNA-sensor recognition step. The direct association of N with RIG-I or MDA5 could not be detected in vitro, and the RNA-binding region in C-terminal domain was essential for IFN expression inhibition, thus implying that the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production by N protein may probably due to its ability in binding to and shielding viral RNAs from the recognition by cellular PRRs.",

RIG-I and MDA5 could be efficiently precipitated in the same experiment, which indicated the precipitation condition was suitable (Fig. 6a). Since N has the ability to self-associate, the interaction between the Flag-tagged and Myc-tagged N was set as a positive control, and Flag-N interacted with Myc-N as expected (Fig. 6a, right). Considering that RIG-I and MDA5 will undergo conformation change upon exogenous stimuli, the same IP analysis was performed upon Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) transfection. However, the interaction between N and RIG-I or MDA5 still cannot be detected (Fig. 6b). These results demonstrate that N does not inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production through binding cytosolic PRRs.\n",

However, SARS-CoV infection does not result in IFN production in many cell cultures and pretreatment of cells with IFN blocks SARS-CoV infection [13, 24\u201326]. The N protein of SARS-CoV was found to inhibit the activation of IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB induced by SenV, resulting in inhibition of IFN synthesis [8]. Sendai virus has been verified to be recognized by cytosolic sensor RIG-I to elicit type \u0399 IFN production, while MDA5 can recognize cytosolic poly(I:C) [27]. In this report, we found that N could inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production induced not only by SenV but also by poly(I:C), and N could inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production induced by SenV or poly(I:C) in MDA5- or RIG-I-transfected cells, and the inhibitory effect was dose-dependent. Further, we found that N could not inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production induced by downstream signaling molecules of TLR3- and RLR-dependent pathways (RIG-I-2CARD, VISA, TRIF, TBK1, and IKK\u03b5). These results suggested that N protein suppresses the IFN-\u03b2 production and N only targets a very early step in IFN induction pathway. Since N could not inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 production activated by RIG-I-2CARD, it can be envisaged that N may function by blocking the beginning PRRs-RNA-recognition step of IFN-\u03b2 induction. Then we sought to investigate whether N could inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production through binding and thus inactivate cytosolic PRRs. However, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that N protein did not interact with RIG-I or MDA5, which indicates that N must have employed other mechanism to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production.",

            "text": "The N protein is a 46 kDa protein composed of 422 amino acids. N protein can be divided into two structural domains interspersed with three disordered regions [22]: the N-terminal domain(NTD, aa 45\u2013181) which is responsible for RNA-binding; the C-terminal domain(CTD, aa 248\u2013365) which is responsible for dimerization and have been indentified to bind to nucleic acid even stronger than the NTD [23]. A deletion mutant of CTD, which includes aa 281\u2013365, totally lost the ability to bind to nucleic acid and retains dimerization activity [23]. Besides, it has been demonstrated that all three disordered regions of SARS-CoV N protein are involved in RNA-binding [30]. N truncation assays showed that SenV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production was significantly suppressed by expression of CTD-containing constructs, while the C-CTD (aa 281\u2013365) almost lost the ability to reduce IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity (Fig. 7c). These results imply that the C-terminal domain of N protein, which is located between positions 248 and 365, may be critical for suppressing IFN expression responses in host cells. As the RNA-binding ability of CTD is indispensable for its inhibition effect, we deduce that N may function by binding to IFN-inducing RNAs and shielding them from the recognition by cellular PRRs. However, the precise mechanism of N suppression is still not clear, and further experiments are needed. In our assay, C\u2032 exerted a stronger ability to reduce IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity than CTD domain, which indicates the disorder regions may be also involved in the inhibitory function of N protein. In addition, the N-terminal domain and central linker region slightly inhibited the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation induced by SenV. As we mentioned above, all the structural domains and disordered regions have been found to have RNA-binding ability, so it may be possible that N exhibits its IFN inhibition activity through all the RNA-binding sequences. Besides, SARS-CoV N protein has been proven to undergo various post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and sumoylation in N-terminal and phosphorylation in NTD and central SR-rich motif. Whether these modifications have any effect on N\u2019s IFN expression inhibition ability is an interesting question and deserves further exploration.",
