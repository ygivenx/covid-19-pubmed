More than a year in, the heroic, selfless work of those battling on the front lines appears to be reining in a raging epidemic. But what can be said of global capacity to detect and control similar events at their inception? Are we prepared for\u2014and is it possible to prevent\u2014a future pandemic?",

Undetected, the virus moved out, carried by infected family members and care givers along rutted dirt tracks to neighboring communities, slipping quickly beyond the capacity of war ravaged and beleaguered public health systems to contain.",

Through 2012, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-endorsed trained epidemiologists in West Africa ranged from 0.22 to 1.54 per million population, at best, only a third of CDC\u2019s recommended level. No trainees were produced in Liberia\u2014or Guinea, where the outbreak originated. We must redouble our efforts to train and equip cadres of field epidemiologists who serve as the primary defense against these threats. These disease detectives should represent both human and animal health sectors, working collaboratively\u2014and, critically, informed by community perspectives, cultural contexts, and appropriate communication strategies\u2014to identify, rapidly diagnose, and respond to events. They must be capable of operationalizing those foundational principles\u2014case finding, isolating sick patients, contact tracing, quarantine\u2014that can shift the course of events, tipping the balance toward snuffing out a cluster at its inception.",

Modernity demands a rebalance from our historically reactive, emergency control and containment to a proactive, preventative approach. This is not a radically new concept for medicine\u2014prevention is the basis of modern public health, but the scale is much larger, and solutions will need to be innovative and imaginative. While it\u2019s unlikely we will ever definitively know how this virus moved out from the forest\u2014that fateful spillover event that set the chain of transmission alight\u2014we can be certain that these events are not aberrations.

If it seems as though pandemic threats are increasingly dominating headlines, it is, in fact, because they are. The public health community is watching closely the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in the Arabian Peninsula, and is preparing for a recrudescence of H7N9 influenza in China this winter. What binds these diseases together is the human hand in their emergence. Most emerging diseases originate in animals, and their emergence is driven by our expansion of road networks, land use change, our intensification of livestock production, bushmeat hunting, and the wildlife trade. A human population approaching 9 billion by 2050 is etching an indelible mark on the planet. How we produce food and extract resources to fuel economic growth, compounded by aggressive land development and a changing climate are driving human and animal populations into unprecedented levels of contact. These are the seeds of a future pandemic.",

Targeting prevention and surveillance programs geographically to these regions reduces the size of the funding burden. Further, programs that help reduce high-risk human activities in these regions can be effective at preventing the first spillover of a pathogen from wildlife to people. Efforts to alter wildlife market chains, slaughtering and butchering practices, hunting of high-risk species, and other behavior that brings people into close contact with zoonoses can be successful mitigation strategies. And pushing upstream in addressing disease emergence should be complemented by policy that views these events through an economic lens.",

If the epidemic is not brought under control, economic impact across Africa in 2015 could reach $6 billion. While this upper estimate is unlikely under conditions of waning incidence, undoubtedly the path to pre-outbreak levels of growth and investor confidence will be arduous. Already, this Ebola virus event is the lengthiest in recorded history and has accounted for over ten times the number of cases than all previous known outbreaks combined. Borders have been closed, states of emergency declared, and travel and trade in the region severely constrained. The FAO has warned of severe food shortages. Previously, the World Bank placed the cost of six zoonotic disease outbreaks\u2014diseases such as SARS and avian influenza transmissible from animals to humans\u2014from 1997 to 2009 at $80 billion, an annualized burden of $6.7 billion. Yet pre-Ebola outbreak levels of pandemic prevention funding amounted to a fraction of these costs, following an economic downturn that drastically contracted budgets for global disease detection and response. This defies logic that should prioritize more cost effective investments in prevention and early detection over the much larger expenditures needed for control and containment.",

Such high profile fora help sustain the vigilance, political commitment, and resources required to achieve a shared vision for a world free from pandemic threats. Ebola virus in West Africa, much like the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, serves as a shot across the bow. We must take the dual path of addressing upstream emergence risk while ensuring systems are capable of finding that 2-year-old child, rapidly diagnosing and halting an epidemic in its tracks. Not to utilize these events as test preparation is an opportunity we can ill afford to miss.",
