Also, given the close connection that exists between personal cleanliness and children\u2019s health, if any headway is to be made toward the minimization or total elimination of some childhood diseases, then scientific studies on personal hygiene among preschoolers are warranted. There is no better place to do such research than in the preschool classroom. A review of the literature on Early Childhood Health Education revealed that not much research has been done concerning personal hygiene topics taught in preschool classrooms. This study fills that vacuum.",

For example, in their study of hygiene levels and their association with infectious diseases among preschoolers, Sherriff and Golding (2002) noted that it is essential for caregivers to operate in a clean environment. The need for caregivers to operate in a clean environment in order to minimize the occurrence and spread of disease is also bolstered by Hagerhed-Engman et al.\u2019s (2006) study in which they discovered a strong connection between day-care attendance and the increased risk for developing respiratory and allergic symptoms.",

He discovered that preschoolers are at high risk for gastrointestinal diseases caused by a large number of enteric pathogens and called for the training and education of caregivers and children in good personal hygiene given the fact that the risk of such diseases is increased by the greater potential for person-to-person transmission within group care. In particular, he called for great emphasis to be placed on frequent hand-washing, separating change areas from food handling and eating areas, and routine cleaning and disinfecting of environmental settings. Kotch et al.\u2019s (2007) work also showed that hand-washing and the availability of diapering equipment reduced disease among children in out-of-home child care centers. The above studies give further credence to the need to take the study of hygiene in preschool settings very seriously.",
