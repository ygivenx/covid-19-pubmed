A known rare complication of Zika infection is Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Currently, Zika infection risk in the UK would be limited to imported cases of people infected abroad, reflecting the locations where mosquitoes are carrying Zika virus. Aedes aegypti is currently restricted to presence in Madeira, Georgia and South Russia, although it was recently found for the first time in the Netherlands.17 In none of these areas has Zika virus been reported to date.18",

For influenza it is thought that this risk of transmission is restricted to the room where dental care is given, provided the door to the room is closed.21,22 In the early phase of response to H1N1, when there were concerns that this form of influenza caused high mortality, the American guidance recommended negative pressure air handling and full fit-tested protective equipment.23",

Aerosol sprays bombardment of mucous membranes of someone with the disease is a potential mechanism to facilitate transmission of Ebola (or a digestive system infection) when the causative organism may be present in the mouth of those infected.

If urgent dental care is required for symptomatic returnees or for those who have had contact with symptomatic individuals, advice should be sought from a health protection team before treatment commences. Personal protective equipment and modification of cross infection precautions will be needed appropriate to the mode of transmission of the organism.27 Decontamination of the surgery and equipment will also be needed. The surgery is more likely to become widely contaminated through aerosol sprays, therefore aerosol spray generation should be minimised. Experience with SARS highlights appropriate responses for a highly infectious high mortality respiratory infection.28,29 In the absence of negative pressure operating rooms there are products which can help to manage the air in an aerosol generating environment.30",
