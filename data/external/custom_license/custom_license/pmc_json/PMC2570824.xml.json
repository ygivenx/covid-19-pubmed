The expected number of monthly deaths for each month in 2006 was calculated by multiplying the average mortality rate for each month (2002\u20132005) by the monthly population in 2006. Because there were 12 estimates of expected deaths (1 for each month), we used the more conservative simultaneous confidence interval (CI) and the Bonferroni method (9) instead of a simple CI for each month separately. Excess deaths for each month in 2006 were the difference between actual observed number of deaths and expected number of deaths. Average monthly mortality rates for 2002\u20132005 were then compared with the mortality rate for 2006 (epidemic year).",

No major adverse event or other epidemic occurred in Ahmebabad in August\u2013November 2006 other than the chikungunya epidemic. Our epidemiologic evidence shows that the epidemic is the most plausible explanation for the large increase in deaths in Ahmedabad in August\u2013November 2006. However, other unidentified causes cannot be ruled out. Similar data from other cities and areas affected by the chikungunya epidemic may help establish the link between chikungunya and excess deaths.",

Inclusion of patients from surrounding rural areas who died in city hospitals could have resulted in excess deaths being reported during the epidemic. However, this was a problem in years before the epidemic (2002\u20132005) as well. A review of deaths registered in rural areas outside the city limits of Ahmedabad showed no major decrease during the epidemic months of 2006 over previous years. Thus, the increase in number of deaths caused by migration of sick patients cannot explain this major increase in deaths in 2006, although this factor may have contributed to it.",

With limited case data reported from India and a mortality rate on R\u00e9union Island of 1 per 1,000 cases, it was previously estimated that India would have \u22481,200\u201319,000 deaths caused by the chikungunya epidemic (12).

The government of India has declared repeatedly in the parliament that \u201cthere are no deaths directly attributable to Chikungunya\u201d in India (6). Although 10 deaths caused by chikungunya were reported by the medical officer of health in Ahmebadad, the website of the government of India continues to report \u201czero deaths\u201d (5). Further investigations on the cause of excess deaths are urgently needed to conclusively establish that chikungunya was the cause of excess deaths in Ahmedabad. Given the possible association of deaths with the chikungunya fever epidemic in Ahmedabad, public health authorities should investigate such epidemics in other countries. These investigations will help determine whether the virus has increased in virulence, which may also pose a greater threat outside the Indian Ocean region. Such studies would help detect and control similar epidemics and help governments to provide adequate warnings to travelers to chikungunya-endemic countries.",

Given poor reporting of deaths, an unexplained cause of death cannot be ruled out. Mortality rate data for Ahmedabad are consistent with observations of other researchers that the virus may have mutated and become more dangerous than reported (8). Public health authorities must investigate recent epidemics. Otherwise, developing countries may not be able to detect and combat severe future epidemics of other reemerging diseases such as avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome.
