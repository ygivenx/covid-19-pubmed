The IFN-\u03b2 1a preparation employed in this study was selected because it is currently used as part of the most effective treatment regimen for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (8), and more importantly, because it was shown to have antiviral activity (as measured in a vesicular stomatitis virus cytopathic assay system) 14 times greater than the currently available treatment using IFN-\u03b2 1b (9).",

Inhibition of the SARS-CoVs by IFN-\u03b2 1a was dependent on both time of drug administration and time of culture sampling after SARS-CoV infection. Production of infectious SARS-CoV was potently inhibited (\u226599.5% or 2.00 log10 PFU/mL) at 24 h postinfection. by pretreatment of Vero E-6 cells with IFN-\u03b2 1a at all concentrations tested (Figure 1). By 72 h postinfection, inhibition of SARS-CoV production by IFN-\u03b2 1a had declined for all three SARS-CoVs, with inhibition (>70%) being detected in the Tor7 (Figure 1) and Urbani isolates (data not shown). IFN-\u03b2 1a was somewhat less effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV replication when employed after infection of cultures (Figure 1). Nonetheless, production of infectious SARS-CoVs was considerably reduced (\u226590% or 1.00 log10 PFU/mL) at 24 and 48 h postinfection. Protection of Vero E-6 monolayers against SARS-CoV\u2013induced cytopathic effects by preinfection or postinfection treatment with IFN-\u03b2 1a was dramatic, even at 72 h postinfection (Figure 2). Additional concentrations of IFN-\u03b2 1a (0.5\u20135,000 IU/mL) were tested to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Pretreatment of Vero E-6 cells with concentrations as low as 50 IU/mL, or posttreatment of cells with concentrations at 500 IU/mL, provided a 50% reduction with the Tor2 isolate at 24 h postinfection.",

As noted above, IFN-\u03b2 1a is currently being used for a variety of clinical indications, including multiple sclerosis, and has shown dose-dependent efficacy in several clinical trials. Importantly, IFN-\u03b2 1a exhibited potent antiviral activity at doses that have already been shown to have acceptable safety profiles in animals (10).
