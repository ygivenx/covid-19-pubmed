The disease not only causes fatal watery diarrhea in piglets, but also significant weight loss in pigs of all ages. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae. The recent outbreaks and worldwide re-emergence of PEDV have been reported in several countries including the USA, China, Korea, and Thailand [1, 2]. Without the effective protective agents, the disease has led to great economic losses worldwide [3].",

Probiotic bacteria can promote the host defense mechanisms and modulation of immune system, with the potential to enhance the antiviral activity [5, 6]. Among them, the group of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including genera Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecium, is generally used as probiotics in animal productions [7]. The failure in finding new antiviral substances without adverse side effects [8] and the benefits of probiotics treatment in patients with rotavirus (RV) and HIV-associated diarrhea have led to an increased interest in probiotic bacteria as antiviral inhibitors [9, 10]. Although many researches show the antiviral effects of LAB on several viral infections in humans and livestock [11\u201313], few studies report on antiviral activity using only cell-free supernatant against a classical strain of PEDV [8]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on antiviral activity using both cell-free supernatant (CFS) and live LAB cells against a pandemic strain of PEDV.",

The cytotoxicity assay showed that at 1:16 to 1:64 CFS dilution of all LAB strains had no cytotoxicity to morphology of Vero cells (Fig. 2), and were used for the further antiviral assays. The antiviral effects of LAB CFS against PEDV on Vero cells was investigated by co-incubation with serial dilutions of CFS, and CFS adjusted to pH 7. After the co-incubation, the reduction of viral infectivity could be observed using CPE reduction assays and confirmed by qualitative immunofluorescence. A reduction of immunofluorescence signal indicated a decrease in PEDV infectivity in Vero cell monolayers (Fig. 3). The CFS of Lact. plantarum (22F, 25F, and 31F) at dilution 1: 16 were able to reduce the CPE and immunofluorescence signal to less than 50% observed field area (+) compared with only PEDV infected Vero cells (>75% observed field area, +++) (Table 1 and Fig. 3). In contrast, the CFS of Ent. faecium (79N and 40N) at dilution 1:16 exhibited no reduction of CPE and immunofluorescence signal. Moreover, at the dilution of 1:32 and 1:64 and adjusted pH 7, no reduction of viral infectivity was observed from all LAB strains (Table 1 and Fig.3).\n\n\n\n",

Our finding confirmed that at 1:16 dilution of CFS of all lactobacilli could reduce the CPE without cytotoxicity towards the Vero cells, but not with the higher dilutions. This might relate to the lower level of antiviral substances such as NO\u2212, hydrogen peroxide, fatty acid, lactic acid, and acetic acid, in higher dilutions [12, 13, 21\u201323]. Furthermore, there were no antiviral effects observed from CFS adjusted to pH 7. Therefore, we assume that the inhibition of viral infectivity presented in this study might not be derived from bacteriocins, since it has been proven to also function at physiological pH [24]. Although, the accurate mechanisms of the antiviral effects from LAB CFS are still unclear, several studies have suggested possible explanations. Firstly, the acidity of CFS might help denaturing the viral capsid proteins and preventing them from cell attachment [25]. However, this might not apply for our study since we could not use the original pH of LAB CFS due to its toxicity towards the Vero cell. The more possible mechanism maybe the hindering and blocking of viral adsorption into the cells by CFS metabolites [26]. Therefore, the antiviral substances within CFS and their protective mechanisms will be investigated in further study.",

The minimum viable LAB concentration required to observe antiviral effects at 106 CFU/mL was in agreement with previous studies against rotavirus and gastroenteritis coronavirus, while the strongest effect was shown at 108 CFU/mL [12, 13, 25, 27, 28].
