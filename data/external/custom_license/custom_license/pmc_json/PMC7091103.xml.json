The ability to concurrently concentrate bacterial and viral pathogens is useful to assess the risks from waterborne pathogens and in source tracking (Fong and Lipp 2005). Bovine enteric viruses in particular have been suggested to identify animal sources of fecal pollution (Ley et al. 2002; Bofill-Mas et al. 2011). Most studies in this area have been directed at the concentration of human enteric viruses from water (Ikner et al. 2012), or separate strategies for concentrating bacteria (Goyal and Gerba 1980; Bisha et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Sodocalcic glass wool offers a promising alternative as an adsorptive material for virus concentration. Glass wool, held together by a binding agent and coated with mineral oil, provides both hydrophobic and electropositive sites for adsorption of microorganisms. Viruses are usually negatively charged in water at or near neutral pH and readily adsorb to the positively charged glass wool fibers (Environment Agency 2000). The fibers are inexpensive and require no water conditioning outside of pH adjustment in some circumstances (Wyn-Jones and Sellwood 2001). Glass wool has been shown to be effective for the concentration of human enteric viruses from wastewater (Gantzer et al. 1997), drinking water (Grabow et al. 2001; Vivier et al. 2004; Van Heerden et al. 2005; Lambertini et al. 2008), groundwater (Powell et al. 2000, 2003; Van Zyl et al. 2004; Ehlers et al. 2005), river water (Hot et al. 2003; Van Heerden et al. 2005; Albinana-Gimenez et al. 2009), and reservoirs (Van Zyl et al. 2004; Ehlers et al. 2005; Deboosere, et al. 2011).",

Quantifying the seeded pathogens in a negative eluate takes into consideration differences in pathogen enumeration that could result from matrix differences created by the glass wool filter.

Glass wool filters have been used by several groups (Lambertini et al. 2008; Environment Agency 2000; Vilagin\u00e8s et al. 1993) to concentrate human enteric viruses from a variety of water sources. Here we report the use of these filters for concentrating both viral and bacterial pathogens associated with cattle manure from water at turbidity levels simulating agricultural runoff. The filters are advantageous in that they are inexpensive, highly portable, usable in a wide range of water matrices, and effective for simultaneous concentration of both bacterial and viral waterborne pathogens.
