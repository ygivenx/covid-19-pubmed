With the progress of new technologies, such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing, the Human Genome Project and the ENCODE project opened a new era of genetics at an unprecedented rate. Earlier evolutionary studies concluded that ncRNAs bear no evidence of function, as a result of poorly conserved sequences, which are conventionally subject to the product of transcriptional noise. However, ncRNAs have been demonstrated to be the \u201cdark energy\u201d of DNA.3,4 The evolution of ncRNAs is different from protein-coding genes, which conclude various scenarios for the origins of functional ncRNAs. Several classifications6 can be defined, including (i) gene frame disruptions and transformation into a functional ncRNA (such as the Xist7 lncRNA), (ii) untranscribed and separated sequence regions that juxtapose following the chromosome's rearrangement, (iii) retrotransposition to generate either retrogenes or retropseudogenes, (iv) tandem duplication in neighboring gene repeats, and (v) insertion of a transposable elements. However, numerous lncRNAs are unknown, and the classifications of lncRNAs are based on their location and proximity to protein-coding genes.",

Empirically, lncRNAs are classified according to their position relative to protein-coding genes, which are operationally divided into five classes:8,9 (i) intronic lncRANs are located within an intron of a protein-coding gene in either direction and terminate without overlapping exons; (ii) long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNA) are separated by transcriptional units from protein-coding genes; (iii) bidirectional lncRNAs are transcribed in opposite directions in relation to the promoter of a protein-coding gene; (iv) antisense lncRNAs are transcribed across the exons of protein-coding genes from the opposite direction; and (v) transcribed pseudogene lncRNAs are transcribed from a gene without the ability to produce a protein. Although many lncRNAs are perceived to lack coding potential, it was unexpected that some of them could encode small peptides in different tissues and species. Lauressergues et al.10 showed that pri-miR171b and pri-miR165a can produce peptides that trigger the accumulation of miR171b and miR165a.",

            "text": "The molecular functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs have been described in several comprehensive reviews.11,12 The precise sequence and natural structure of lncRNAs mostly determine what that they interact with. Through employing RNA\u2013RNA, RNA\u2013DNA, or RNA\u2013protein interactions, lncRNAs produce various processes to regulate transcription, splicing, nucleic acid degradation, decoy, and translation. lncRNAs are expressed in specific cell types and different cellular locations (nuclear or cytosolic), which determine their molecular function mechanisms. Additionally, their expression is under considerable transcriptional control. In the cytosol, lncRNAs not only interact directly with target RNAs to control their expression and mRNA translation but also interact with specific signaling proteins to regulate their pathway-specific gene expression programs. By contrast, nucleic lncRNAs play important roles in modulating epigenetic13,14 and transcriptional processes15 to regulate gene expression by acting as signal, guide, decoy, or scaffold. As molecular signals, lncRNAs can faithfully mark the time, space, developmental stage, and expression of gene regulation, which combine the actions of transcription factors and signaling pathways to regulate gene expression and subsequent biological events. As decoys, lncRNAs are transcribed and then titrate proteins, transcription factors, regulatory factors, or epigenetic modifiers (such as Gas516 and Lethe17). They can also decoy miRNAs and splicing factors that function as molecular sponges. As guides, lncRNAs can recruit chromatin modifiers in cis (co-transcription or as complementary regulatory RNAs) or trans conformations by binding to target DNA (heteroduplex, RNA:DNA or triplex, RNA:DNA:DNA, or specific recognition of chromatin). As scaffolds, lncRNAs can act as central platforms that bring and bind to multiple proteins or nucleotides, which function on chromatin by altering histone modifications and stabilize nuclear structures or signaling complexes. The mechanisms of gene regulation by lncRNAs are intricate and complicated, and lncRNAs themselves possess different sequences, domains, and structures. lncRNAs can utilize each characteristic to regulate biological function and can also possess integrated functions, which may have activating or repressive transcriptional activities, both in time and space.",

            "text": "Some lncRNAs are preferentially expressed in the immune system and play important roles in immune cell development.18 Many studies have revealed highly dynamic and cell-specific expression patterns for lncRNAs during immune cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation (Table 1). The noncoding transcript in CD4+ T cells (NTT)19 and growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (Gas5)16 have been known for several years. Non-coding repressor of NFAT (NRON) inhibits the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in human-activated T cells,20 and also acts as a scaffold lncRNA to sequester phosphorylated NFAT into the cytoplasmic RNA-protein complex.21 LincR-Ccr2-5\u2032AS is a TH2-specific lncRNA that controls the expression of immune genes in TH2 cells and regulates the migration of mouse TH2 cells into the lung in vivo.22\nTmevpg1 is co-expressed with Ifng,23 and Tmevpg1- and Ifng-specific enhancers are stimulated by T-bet through epigenetic remodeling to achieve TH1-lineage-specific expression of Ifng.24 linc-MAF-4 is a CD4+ TH1 cell-specific lncRNA and promotes a CD4+ TH1 phenotype, which probably acts as a scaffold and regulates MAF transcription.25 lnc-DC regulates the differentiation of human monocytes into dendritic cells, which directly interacts with STAT3 in cytoplasm and prevents the dephosphorylation of STAT3 by SHP1.26 HOTAIRM1 (HOX antisense intergenic RNA myeloid) is specifically expressed in myeloid cells27 and upregulated by retinoic acid-induced granulocyte differentiation of promyelocytic NB4 leukemia cells. Profiling of the lncRNA transcriptome in CD8+28 and CD4+ T cells29 identified thousands of lncRNAs, which have shown stage- or tissue-specific expression. However, little is known about lncRNAs in B-cell development and function. Collectively, future studies would provide a better definition of the roles of the vast repertoire of lncRNAs in the differentiation, plasticity, and effector functions of different immune cell types. Moreover, lncRNAs also play important roles in innate immunity.30,31 This review will focus on the roles and mechanistic modes of lncRNAs in innate immune responses and the interactions between hosts and pathogens.",

Intriguingly, lncBST2/BISPR, lncISG15 and their coding neighbors are increased with HCV infection and in the liver of infected patients.

However, VIN loss-of-function analysis reveals its importance during productive IAV replication and viral protein synthesis, which indicates that VIN favors IAV propagation and virulence. Consequently, viruses may hijack lncRNAs for their own replication and suppress antiviral responses in diverse biological processes by a variety of mechanisms.",

Four hundred and ninety-four upregulated and 413 downregulated lncRNAs following the viral infection were detected and clustered. However, NRAV was most significantly downregulated during infection with several viruses. In vitro and in vivo data show that NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical ISGs, including IFITM3 and MxA, which might affect histone modifications of these genes. ZO-1-associated nucleic acid binding protein (ZONAB) is an NRAV-bound protein that acts as a positive regulator, and these proteins interact with each other to repress the expression of ISGs in uninfected cells.

Further study of lncRNA-TARE and other promising lncRNA candidates may provide mechanistic insight into P. falciparum transcriptional regulation. The var antisense lncRNAs that initiate from var introns are associated with the specific active var gene during the cell cycle when the single var upstream promoter is active.71 Additionally, var antisense lncRNAs are incorporated into chromatin and expression of these lncRNAs in trans triggers activation of a silent var gene in a sequence- and dose-dependent manner, which erases epigenetic memory and induces expression switching.

Although many lncRNAs should lack coding potential, it is unexpected that some of them can encode short peptides in different tissues and species. Undoubtedly, the application of high-throughput technologies, such as RNA-seq80 and ChIRP-MS,81 will clarify how lncRNAs regulate diverse biological processes in physiological and pathophysiological states.
