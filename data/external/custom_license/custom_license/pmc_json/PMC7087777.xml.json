Bats have been identified as the natural hosts of the progenitor viruses of both SARS and MERS coronaviruses (Lau et al. 2005b; Li et al. 2005; Ge et al. 2013; Memish et al. 2013). Following the SARS outbreak, extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats, given their evident potential to host novel zoonotic coronaviruses (Woo et al. 2006). The majority of these studies were based on reverse-transcriptase PCR detection of coronavirus RNA in bat faeces and tissues, or serological detection of coronavirus antibodies in blood samples. Coronaviruses have been detected in 11 of the 18 extant families of bats in more than 25 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas (Drexler et al. 2014).",

Given the zoonotic potential of bat coronaviruses, a better understanding of the distribution and ecology of these viruses is essential to identify any potential threat to human health and to inform biosecurity preparedness. With this aim, we undertook a virological and serological survey of various bat populations in Australia and neighbouring countries for evidence of coronavirus infection. We focused primarily on insectivorous bats, which reportedly host the largest diversity of bat coronaviruses, and particularly targeted bats of the genus Rhinolophus, recognised as hosting SARS-like coronaviruses. We also compared relative detection frequency in various potential routes of excretion.",

Particular effort was made to capture bats at locations where rhinolophid bats were previously known to be present. Captured bats were individually housed in clean cloth bags and a polystyrene cooler prior to sample collection. Bat identification was based on morphological characteristics (Churchill 2008) and was undertaken by experienced biologists. Occasionally, bats were only identified to genus level. All bats were released at their point of capture within 6 h. A single faecal pellet (collected directly from a defecating bat or from its clean cloth bag) was placed into 1 ml of sucrose potassium glutamate albumin (SPGA) with added penicillin, streptomycin and fungizone. When no faecal pellet was obtained, the anus was swabbed and the swab placed in 1 ml SPGA, and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to RNA extraction. Faecal samples collected from bats in Taiwan were placed into 1 ml of AVL buffer from the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and stored at room temperature for 1 week prior to extraction. Faecal swabs from 33 Pteropus alecto and 27 P. poliocephalus opportunistically obtained from colleagues conducting concurrent henipavirus research in south-east Queensland in 2009 were placed in 1 ml SPGA and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to extraction.",

The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 0.0000% sites). Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 (Tamura et al. 2013).",

The prevalence of each varied across species and location, with the prevalence of either viral RNA or antibodies being relatively high in some populations. This variability highlights the complexity of exposure, infection and immune dynamics over space and time. In two species with relatively large sample sizes (Miniopterus australis and M. schreibersii in south-east Queensland), 25% of 154 individuals and 27% of 238 individuals, respectively, were positive for coronavirus RNA. Studies elsewhere have shown similar prevalence rates (Tsuda et al. 2012; Suzuki et al. 2014); others have reported much lower prevalence (Anthony et al. 2013). Seroprevalence in our study was also high in some populations, including those that were negative for viral RNA. This antibody-positive, viral RNA-negative finding most plausibly reflects previous infection. Alternatively, virus excretion associated with current infection may have been occurring at a concentration below the detection level of the RT-PCR assay. In some cases, the limited sample size may have constrained detection of viral RNA in the sampled population. Although there have been fewer serological studies than molecular studies in bats, others have also found high coronavirus antibody prevalence in some bat species, albeit using a different serological assay (Tsuda et al. 2012). Indeed, given that our ELISA was based on SARS-CoV antigens, it may be that broader coronavirus seroprevalence is underestimated.",

Although constrained by the short length of sequence, we were able to identify four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. To obtain a surrogate estimation of taxonomy, Drexler et al. (2010) proposed a scheme based on 816-bp sequence of the RdRp gene to form RdRp grouping units (RGU), defining species separation in mammalian coronaviruses, with >4.8% amino acid sequence distance for alphacoronaviruses and >6.3% amino acid sequence distance for betacoronaviruses. While our field and laboratory work predated this publication and thus precluded use of the approach, based on nucleotide sequence identity, the three novel coronavirus genotypes identified in our study may represent new species.

Our study supports this host species-virus association with the identification of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in M. australis and M. schreibersii from Australia, some 7,000 km from Hong Kong and some 15,000 km from Bulgaria. Similarly, the novel betacoronavirus genotype from Rhinonicteris aurantia is most closely related to betacoronavirus sequence identified in Ghana from bats of the same family Hipposideridae (Pfefferle et al. 2009), although the lower sequence identity should be noted. Finally, our betacoronavirus genotype from P. alecto is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9, identified in Rousettus spp from China and Kenya, and Cynopterus brachyotis from the Philippines, all of which belong to the family Pteropodidae. Notwithstanding the limited number of sequences and modest size of the amplicon evaluated, our findings support the contention that, regardless of location, bats belonging to the same species, genus or family are likely to host closely related coronaviruses. With the recent revision of the taxonomy of bats using comparative-method and molecular studies (Hutcheon and Kirsch 2006), the suborder Pteropodiformes now comprises, amongst others, bats from the families Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae and Pteropodidae. To date, betacoronaviruses have been identified predominantly from bats of these families, so it appears that the host-virus association of bat coronaviruses may extend to bats of the same suborder. Thus, as yet unidentified betacoronaviruses may still be found in other species in other families (Craseonycteridae, Megadermatidae and Rhinopomatidae) in the suborder Pteropodiformes.",

The detection of viral RNA in only one of the 58 R. megaphyllus sampled at that site may indicate that only sporadic spillover is occurring, and intra-species transmission in R. megaphyllus is not (yet) occurring. The genus Rhinolophus is hypothesised to be more likely to foster host shifts and foster the emergence of coronaviruses than other genera (Cui et al. 2007), and our observation is consistent with this. Similarly, our detection of coronavirus RNA in one of the 126 R. aurantia in the absence of any seropositivity in the population may also suggest transmission from another bat species. The sampled R. aurantia population was co-roosting with populations of Hipposideros ater and Macroderma gigas bats (Fig. 3), both of which were positive for anti-coronavirus antibodies, and although negative for coronavirus RNA at the time of sampling, constitute a plausible source of infection. Further investigation of these two species, beyond the scope of this study, is necessary to test this hypothesis. The alternative interpretation of the single RNA detection in both R. megaphyllus and R. aurantia is that the PCR results are spurious. However, we believe that the rigour of our field and laboratory techniques make cross-contamination of samples highly unlikely.",

            "text": "Two methods of evolution have been proposed to explain the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses and their host specificity (Cui et al. 2007; Vijaykrishna et al. 2007). Divergent evolution requires the cross-species transmission of a common ancestor virus and subsequent adaption and establishment in the new host. To account for the identification of related coronaviruses in related species of bats in different locations throughout the world, divergent evolution requires the global distribution of each newly diverged coronavirus. This process is theoretically possible for those bat species that exhibit long-range nomadic movement (Breed et al. 2010). The second evolutionary method is the co-evolution of bat species and their coronaviruses (Cui et al. 2007), whereby the divergence of each bat species is mirrored by the divergence of the coronavirus it hosts. This method accounts for the diversity, relatedness and global distribution of bat coronaviruses, but would require the age of bat coronaviruses to parallel that of the most common bat ancestor, i.e. 65 million years (Churchill 2008). In addition, co-evolution alone does not explain the presence of different coronavirus genera in the same species or genus; for example, hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats hosting both alpha- and betacoronaviruses (Woo et al. 2006; Pfefferle et al. 2009), which intuitively appear to require episodes of host-shifting. Our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity of coronaviruses and host specificity in Australasian bats reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift, most plausibly by hipposiderid and/or rhinolophid bats (Cui et al. 2007). The significance of host geography and host ecology on virus evolution and host-virus interactions has recently been canvassed for bat rabies virus (Streicker et al. 2010, 2012). The concepts may be equally relevant for coronaviruses across the geographic and taxonomic spectrum, and warrant future investigation beyond the scope of this regional study.",

From the (albeit limited) number of bats from which additional sample types were tested in this study (n = 30), coronavirus RNA was detected in oropharyngeal swabs (n = 2) only from animals that were RNA-positive in faecal samples (n = 11), supporting a predominantly enteric tropism of bat coronaviruses.

Four different coronavirus genotypes were identified, including one alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses that are evidently novel. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and provide further support for the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. The findings advance our knowledge of the diversity of coronaviruses in bats. This diversity, the global distribution of bats, and the propensity of coronaviruses to successfully cross species barriers, suggests MERS and SARS-like coronaviruses may not be the only bat coronaviruses that can cause disease outbreaks in humans, and further highlights the need for ongoing investigation of bats and their coronaviruses.",
