We first tested the 2015 camel samples from Kenya by using HI with both IDV antigens; testing with D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 showed 99% seroprevalence and with D/bovine/France/5920/2014 100% seroprevalence (Table 1; data not shown). HI titers were higher than those observed with ruminant samples from North and West Africa (20<HI titers<640, geometric mean titer = 150; Figure 2). When tested by using C/Victoria/1/11, the seroprevalence was 94% (10<HI titers<320, geometric mean titer = 38), suggesting ICV/IDV cross-reactivity. The samples were therefore adsorbed on 4 hemagglutination units of C/Victoria/1/11 and hemadsorbed before being retested in HI with D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 and vice versa (all 293 samples were retested for IDV antibodies after preadsorption with ICV; 85 samples were preadsorbed on IDV and retested for ICV antibodies). Seroprevalences were 8.2% for IDV and 10.6% for ICV. All but 1 of the samples that were positive for IDV antibodies without ICV preadsorption lost >2 log2 (>4-fold decrease in titer) in HI titer once adsorbed on ICV, suggesting these samples had anti-ICV rather than anti-IDV antibodies. The picture was less clear for the reverse experiment: 11% of the IDV preadsorbed samples lost >2 log2 in titer (false ICV antibodies positive); 9% stayed within the 4-fold range (true positives); and the initial ICV antibody titer of the remaining 80% was too low (HI titers of 10 or 20) to determine a status post-IDV adsorption. Taken together, our serology results on camel samples show that almost all the animals had either anti-IDV or ICV antibodies, that there is cross-reactivity in camels between the 2 viruses, and that 9% of the tested samples had anti-ICV antibodies. Camels could therefore be a newly discovered host for ICV, and possibly for IDV. IDV/ICV cross-reactivity was ruled out for bovine samples after a cohort from France was preadsorbed the same way and retested in IDV HI without any change in HI titers (data not shown). Detection of antibodies against IDV in ruminants in Africa raises the question of the virus origin and transmission route. Although the virus has already been reported on 3 continents, the ruminant import/export from/to North and West Africa is limited (e.g., 21,000 cattle imported from Europe to Morocco, no exportations reported; no import or export of cattle reported to or from Togo or Benin; data for North and West Africa, 2013 [11]). Seroprevalences we calculated may also be underestimated because our HI assay was less sensitive than our MN assay (Table 2); numerous freezing and thawing cycles may have altered the samples; and our low titers in ruminants might have been caused by the circulation of a different IDV lineage in Africa or to the unique structure of camel antibodies, which are devoid of light chains and CH1 domain.",

So far cattle, swine, sheep, goats, guinea pigs, and ferrets have been reported to be susceptible to IDV infection (1,6,8,9) and swine, dogs, and humans to ICV infections (12,13). Many aspects of camel health had not been studied before the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (14), but camels had been reported susceptible to influenza A(H1N1) on 1 occasion (15). Our data suggest that ICV and IDV have a wide host tropism and that further investigations on host tropism and on ICV and IDV circulation in camels are warranted.",

This virus has a wide host tropism because cattle, swine, small ruminants, and likely dromedary camels seem susceptible to IDV infection. In addition, we show that camels in Kenya are positive for ICV antibodies, suggesting that this virus also has a wider host range than previously thought. Further studies are warranted to clarify the cross-reactivity of the 2 viruses in serologic assays, to determine which IDV lineages circulate in Africa, and to assess whether ICV alone or both ICV and IDV may infect camels.",
