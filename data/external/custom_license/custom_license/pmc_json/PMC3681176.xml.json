            "text": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive condition caused by mutations in the huge dystrophin gene, is the most common and serious form of childhood muscle wasting, with an incidence of 1 in 3500 live male births (for review see Emery1). Under tissue-specific control of at least seven promoters, the full-length 427 kDa dystrophin isoforms, encoded by 79 exons spanning ~2.4 Mbp, are expressed primarily in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and brain (for review see Love et al2). The prevalence of DMD may be attributed to the high frequency of de novo mutations, which in turn is influenced by the size, nature, and organization of the dystrophin gene. Many dystrophin introns are fivefold to eightfold larger than the average human gene of 30 kb pairs. One in three cases of DMD present with no prior family history,3 and this fact, coupled with the size and complexity of the gene pose great challenges to prevention and genetic counseling programs.",

The reading frame hypothesis proposed by Monaco et al6 holds true in the majority of cases, although there are some exceptions, now explained by altered gene transcript processing.7,8 More importantly, the reading frame rule offered two potential avenues for therapy: 1) Insert the dystrophin-coding sequence from mildly affected/asymptomatic BMD patients into viral vectors and exploit these smaller payloads.9 2) Modify expression of the dystrophin gene to remove or bypass DMD-causing mutations so that a functional BMD-like dystrophin isoform is produced.",

Each strategy offers different targets for intervention and some may be complementary, thereby providing additional possibilities for therapeutic benefit. The greatest benefit to patients is likely to be derived from dystrophin restitution; however, not all DMD mutations will be amenable to molecular interventions, and for some individuals, therapies that reduce muscle pathology may provide at least interim benefits. We will first consider potential treatments designed to modulate pathogenic processes arising from the loss of the functional 427-kDa dystrophin isoform and then discuss nonviral approaches directly impacting upon expression of dystrophin or its homologue, utrophin.",

With steroids now in common use, it is probable that muscular dystrophy patients being considered as subjects for clinical trials of investigational therapies, including molecular interventions, will be taking, or will have been treated with, corticosteroids.

The availability of the mdx mouse33,34 and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog35,36 dystrophinopathy models has led to extensive preclinical studies on potential therapeutics. However, the lack of standardized experimental end points for the mdx mouse37 and phenotypic variation in the dog model,38 together with the high cost of maintaining the dogs, have made rigorous comparisons difficult. Evaluation of a number of compounds for the ability to limit the decline in muscle strength in mdx mice by Granchelli et al39 indicated that prednisone, pentoxifylline, Tinset\u00ae, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), glutamine, glutamine plus alanine, and creatinine all improved muscle strength. Subsequent studies have failed to confirm some of these findings, particularly when treatment duration is extended. Implementation of validated preclinical assessment in mdx mice37,40\u201342 that includes in vivo functional end points and histopathology and biochemical markers will facilitate more rigorous comparison of preclinical data from different laboratories and expedite evaluation in the mdx mouse, leading to effective clinical treatments for DMD.42",

This has prompted the use of exercised mdx mice, which show a typical pattern of muscle weakness in vivo and exacerbated dystrophic pathology in heart.43 Conductance to chloride in mdx muscle is impaired by chronic exercise and responds to treatment with compounds that stimulate regeneration (IGF-1 and steroids) or impede calcium-induced degeneration or inflammation (taurine and steroids).40,41 Short-term beneficial effects on dystrophic pathology in mdx mice using a number of agents, including corticosteroids and arginine, have been reported, while chronic, continuous treatment with prednisone showed deleterious effects to skeletal and cardiac muscles,44 and arginine leads to fibrosis of dystrophic heart and muscles.45 Prednisolone treatment in mdx mice did not affect force loss during eccentric contractions or recovery of force following injury. These data emphasize a limitation of using mice as a preclinical model for DMD, because the increase in muscle strength in boys with DMD and taking prednisolone does not appear to occur via the same mechanism in dystrophic mice.46",

Two cohorts received daily infusions of gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, and the serum creatine kinase was reduced to about 50% in the cohort of DMD individuals with nonsense mutations, whereas there was no change in the cohort of DMD participants whose genes had been inactivated by frameshifting deletions. Two additional cohorts received the low dose (7.5 mg/kg) either weekly or biweekly for 6 months, and dystrophin levels were increased, with the highest levels reaching up to 15% of normal levels. In this study, there was no apparent influence of the different premature stop codon sequences on read-through efficiency, and one patient appeared to raise antibodies to the novel dystrophin protein. This study both justifies and highlights the need for continued screening for compounds to safely induce read-through of premature termination codons. During this study, one participant in the cohort receiving biweekly gentamicin infusions inadvertently received four doses that were 125% of that intended. He suffered transient high-frequency hearing loss and was withdrawn from the study due to protocol requirements.18",

One or more exons flanking a frameshifting exon rearrangement may be removed to restore the reading frame, or an exon carrying a nonsense mutation can be masked from the splicing machinery so that it is removed from the mature gene transcript. Different mutations across the dystrophin gene will require specific exon-skipping strategies, necessitating potential scores of oligomers. Unlike experimental therapies being evaluated to upregulate a homologous gene78\u201380 or read-through premature stop codons15,17,71 (for review see Nelson et al81), exon skipping must be regarded as a personalized therapy because of the spread of different mutations across the dystrophin gene, requiring different exon-skipping strategies. DMD is considered an \u2018orphan disease\u2019, based on the criteria that there are < 200,000 affected individuals in the USA, and there is little incentive to the private sector to develop and market specific therapies. Bringing any drug to the clinic is costly and challenging, and orphan disease status provides incentives to develop treatments for rare conditions. However, when one considers that scores of different AOs would be needed to treat DMD patients with different mutations, the challenges seem insurmountable. Fundamental changes to the drug development pipeline will have to be implemented before exon-skipping therapy can become a reality for all amenable DMD mutations.",

The reading frame rule holds true in the majority of dystrophin mutations,6 with any discordance between the genotype and phenotype normally resolved by studying the dystrophin mRNA and identifying secondary effects on RNA processing as a consequence of the mutation.8 Ginjaar and colleagues7 identified a nonsense mutation in dystrophin exon 29 in one BMD family that induced different levels of exon skipping in three affected boys. The phenotypes in this family varied from healthy to severely affected and appeared to correlate with the amount of exon 29 skipping, since the loss of this exon does not disrupt the reading frame and removes the mutation. Characterization of the dystrophin gene structure in mildly affected or asymptomatic BMD individuals provides templates for functional dystrophin isoforms and establishes which regions of the protein are partially redundant.9,94\u201396 Furthermore, exon skipping has been shown to occur naturally, as evidenced by the presence of revertant dystrophin-positive fibers in many DMD individuals97 and mouse98 and canine99 models of muscular dystrophy. Although occurring at a frequency too low to be of any substantial clinical benefit, these fibers may contribute to the immune tolerance of induced BMD-like dystrophin isoforms.100",

AO design and evaluation in vitro require transfection with either high concentrations of the compound, as uptake is poor, or the use of a delivery agent to enhance delivery. A large number and variety of reagents have been used to deliver charged AOs in vitro, including cationic liposomes,87,88,104 PEI,123 copolymers,124,125 cationic nanoparticles,126 or polymersomes.127 Uncharged PMOs are largely ineffective in vitro unless applied at high concentrations with scrape loading,128 although delivery can be greatly enhanced with the use of a sense strand leash and a cationic lipoplex121 or coupling to cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs)129\u2013133 or an octaguanidine dendrimer.134,135 Although many delivery reagents have facilitated AO uptake in vitro, most will not be applicable to preclinical evaluation or in the clinic. Fortunately, we observed that uncomplexed PMOs were efficiently taken up in the dystrophic muscle after direct intramuscular injection and restored robust dystrophin expression around the injection site.120",

While the mdx mouse does not reflect clinical severity of DMD and the humanized mouse has a human dystrophin gene processed with rodent splicing machinery, perhaps the most appropriate and challenging animal model in which to test exon skipping as a therapy is the dko mouse.147 Although the utrophin or dystrophin null animals appear normal, especially during the early life, the loss of both genes results in animals with severe muscle wasting, and the dko animals typically die by the age of 15 weeks. Repeated, weekly, intraperitoneal administration of a PMO conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide (CPP\u2013PMO), starting a few days after birth, was found to prevent onset of pathology.148 Treated animals remain normal in appearance at 1 year of age (Goyenvalle, personal communication), demonstrating that the restoration of a BMD-like dystrophin isoform in this model is highly functional.",

The inconclusive dystrophin staining in this n = 1 study may be attributed to several factors, including a readily available but less-than-optimal oligomer chemistry or insufficient dosage and duration of treatment to restore detectable dystrophin expression. Although this trial did not generate unequivocal dystrophin expression or demonstrate any benefit to the recipient, there were no adverse effects, and the compounds were reported to be well tolerated.152 ODNs are typically used to downregulate gene expression through induction of RNAseH, a ubiquitous enzyme that degrades the RNA strand of an RNA:ODN duplex.153 We previously demonstrated that ODNs induce dystrophin exon 19 skipping,86 but only after in vitro transfection at much higher concentrations than those used for the same sequence prepared as a 2OMe AO or PMO.

An open biopsy of both muscles was performed 3\u20134 weeks later, and samples were subjected to RT-PCR and immunohistochemical studies. There was a clear dose response. Dystrophin exon 51 skipping was detected in the muscle receiving the low dose, but no protein was evident under preestablished testing conditions. At the high dose, exon 51 skipping was readily detected by RT-PCR in test biopsies from all participants, and there was unequivocal dystrophin expression as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining.20",

Participants were divided into 6 cohorts, each receiving 12, once-weekly, intravenous infusions of AVI-4658 at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20 mg/kg (Muntoni, personal communication). Data indicate that exon skipping was induced in dose-dependent manner, and apart from one individual receiving 2 mg/kg who was found to be a \u2018strong\u2019 responder, all other participants receiving up to 4 mg/kg had transcripts missing exon 51, but protein was not detected. All boys receiving 10 or 20 mg/kg showed strong exon skipping by RT-PCR, and dystrophin expression was readily detectable in three out of four boys in each cohort. One boy from each of these cohorts had considerably higher dystrophin expression than the others who were deemed to be \u2018strong responders\u2019. In summary, seven patients had unequivocally increased dystrophin expression after comparing pre- and posttreatment biopsies (Muntoni, personal communication). An extension to the MDEX study has not been offered to the participants at this stage (see http://www.actionduchenne.org/duchennepedia/article/229/recent-avi-4658-trial-results-), which is unfortunate considering the positive outcomes in terms of dystrophin expression at the higher doses of AVI-4658. One of the most attractive features of the PMO chemistry is that these compounds appear to be very well tolerated, with no PMO-related effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, global neurological, renal, or liver parameters after administration of the maximum feasible dose (320 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys.159 Both the mouse and the canine models of muscular dystrophy have received different PMOs at substantial dosages of 200 mg/kg in the GRMD animal149 and 3 gm/kg in the mdx mouse.144 Dystrophin expression was restored without overt toxicity; however, the consequences of long-term exposure at these dosages are yet to be established.",

Until recently, patent protection on morpholino synthesis restricted the production of Good Laboratory Practice-compliant PMOs, and production facilities at this point in time are limited. Potential manufacturers would be reluctant to commit to major capital expenditure on expanded production facilities, especially when there is no guaranteed demand. Although the PMO exon-skipping trials are generating exceedingly positive data, no obvious clinical benefit has yet been conferred to any participant, and future requirements for these conpounds are uncertain at this time.",

Those involved in early molecular biology experiments may recall the high cost of oligomers used as gene-specific probes or for PCR. Not only has the quality and reliability of production increased, but also costs have decreased by orders of magnitude. In some respects, there are many similarities to the development of penicillin, where the first reported US patient treated for streptococcal septicemia used one half of the total available supply produced by Merck & Co (White-house Station, NJ).160 At that time, penicillin was priceless, and 15 months later, there was only enough material to treat 10 patients (see http://www.lib.niu.edu/2001/iht810139.html). However, in response to demand to treat casualties from World War II, there was a concentrated effort to increase production, and by 1946, the cost was reported as 55c per dose.",
