It is an enveloped virus and has a positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA genome, approximately 27 kb in length. The virion has three major structural proteins namely the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the spike (S) glycoprotein. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits [6]. The S1 subunit, located on the outside of the virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the host cell membrane. Moreover, it is responsible for neutralizing serotype-specific antibodies in chickens [4]. The S1 subunit demonstrates more sequence variability than S2 [14]. Neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes are associated with the defined hypervariable region (HVR) in the S1 subunit; therefore, the molecular characterization of IBV is based on analysis of the S1 gene [12].",

Sick chickens were selected and sent to the Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University. Necropsy was performed and gross lesions were evaluated. Gross lesions showed mild- to moderated tracheitis and non-purulent airsacculitis. No gross lesion were found in the kidneys. The trachea and lung samples were taken as pools of chickens from the same farm. The samples were prepared as 10% w/v suspensions in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and clarified at 1,800 \u00d7 g for 10 min; the supernatants were then collected for analysis.",

Different serotypes have been reported world wide and new variant serotypes continue to be recognized [9,18]. Thus, it is necessary and important to be able to diagnose these new serotypes. Furthermore, determining the type as well as field isolates is important to select an appropriate vaccine against IBV infection in the next flock. Therefore, several tests have been employed to identify the isolates into serotypes or genotypes [15]. Typing with RT-PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene is easier and faster than the more traditional virus neutralization methods, but it is difficult to design PCR primers that can be used for detect all of IBV isolates [16]. In this study, IBV isolates in group I could not be detected with the primer set and PCR method described by Gelb et al. [8]. To overcome this problem, the new primer sets were designed and the nested RT-PCR was developed in order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the test used to detect IBV from the infected samples. Moreover, the region amplified by the outer primer covering the HVR of the S1 gene (nucleotide position 31~908) could be used for typing of IBV.",

It has been shown that the genetic typing based on HVR I (nucleotide position 114~325) of the S1 gene could represent the grouping method based on the whole S1 gene [20]. Furthermore, in a recent study using an approximately 450-bp region covering HVR I and HVR II for IBV typing, it was found that typing by this region correlates with virus neutralization results [17]. In the present study, an approximately 878-bp region of S1 gene covering HVR I and HVR II were amplified and used for typing the field isolates in Thailand.",

The molecular data indicated that the recent IBV isolated in Thailand evolved separately into two groups. The IBV isolates in group I were not related to other IBV strains published in the GenBank database. This genotype likely represents strains indigenous to Thailand. IBV isolates in group II were genetically related to Chinese strains.",

The rationale for these changes could be due to immunological pressure caused by the wide spread use of vaccines, recombination as a consequence of mixed infections, or the decrease of dominant serotypes as a result of vaccination, allowing other field strains to emerge [19].",
