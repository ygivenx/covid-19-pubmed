Recommendation for surgical delay is based on concerns for prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) and respiratory complications following surgery. However, there is no standard for clinical or laboratory screening tests to be used pre-operatively to evaluate for occult respiratory infections in infants undergoing cardiac surgeries. Peri-operative questioning of families for risk factors prior to surgery has been used, but is not standardized. The introduction of multiplex molecular tests using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a rapid screen for respiratory viruses in asymptomatic children, with results available within a couple of hours [7, 8]. Theoretically, detection of viruses pre-operatively could be used as a tool to decrease the incidence of post-operative complications in infants who are positive, and avoid unnecessary postponements in surgery for those with negative testing. However, there are no data showing the effectiveness of either viral diagnostics or peri-operative questionnaires. In the absence of significant symptoms, the clinical impact of viral respiratory pathogen detection or positive screening for risk factors on post-operative outcomes following cardiac surgery in infants is unknown.",

The final patient with pulmonary hypertension had a non-Trisomy 21 AVC and a history of a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Thirty-nine (67%) patients had a biventricular surgical repair via median sternotomy with 33 (57%) of the procedures falling within RACHS categories 1\u20132. The most common defect was a VSD and thus the most common surgical procedure was closure of a VSD.

There were no significant differences in baseline demographics between infants with positive vs. negative pre-operative viral respiratory testing with the exception that there was a greater proportion of patients who were on pre-operative oxygen supplementation in the PCR(+) group.

Four of these seven patients had positive assays. Three tested positive for HRV (75%) and one tested positive for RSV (25%), with two of the four having the same viral pathogen detected pre-and post-operatively (1 RSV and 1 HRV). Patients with post-operative respiratory symptoms who subsequently tested positive (n = 4) or negative (n = 3) for a viral pathogen had significantly longer HLOS, CICU LOS, and intubation time when compared to those not tested for infection (n = 51). Oxygen therapy at home discharge was common among patients PCR(+) post-operatively (50%) or not tested (39%). However, none of the three patients tested negative post-operatively required home oxygen at discharge as one patient died before discharge and the other two had biventricular repairs with a prolonged length of stay during which the oxygen was weaned off prior to discharge (Table 4).",

In contrast to viral detection methods that evaluate cell-killing or viral antigen presentation, molecular assays do not require live organisms for detection. Therefore, while rates of detection are generally higher in symptomatic individuals, these tests are sometimes positive in asymptomatic children [12]. For instance, in one study, nuclear acid testing (NAT) increased pathogen detection from 4 to 42% of hospitalized children without symptomatic respiratory viral infection when compared to conventional testing such as enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) [7]. Thus, while PCR testing is a very sensitive test for the detection of pathogens [13], positive testing may not identify or predict symptomatic illness.",

This result is most likely due to the highly sensitive nature of multiplex nucleic acid testing, and thus positive testing may not be indicative of clinical infection. This is in contrast to Altman et al. [14] who examined the utility of pre-operative testing utilizing nasopharyngeal EIA for respiratory viruses in children (16 days to 4 years of age) undergoing heart surgery. Twenty-two patients were RSV positive and their surgery was delayed for approximately 2\u20134 weeks. Retesting prior to delayed surgery was not reported [14]. The authors concluded that peri-operative screening for RSV was useful as it may prevent important post-operative morbidity, mortality and cost related to hospitalization secondary to community acquired RSV infection [14]. An important difference between Altman\u2019s study and the present study is the difference in diagnostic testing. The EIA assay detects antigens from actively replicating viruses, whereas PCR testing only requires the presence of viral DNA in the sample. This may explain the difference in outcomes between Altman\u2019s study and our own.",

This practice has been advocated for testing on symptomatic patients in order to detect viral infection before transplant, and positive testing has resulted in delay of transplantation when feasible. However, the practice of testing in asymptomatic patients may not be necessary and warrants further study [15, 16]. Similarly, in our study, pre-operative identification of respiratory viruses by rapid molecular testing in the absence of clinical symptoms did not predict increased morbidity or mortality. Correspondingly, patients in the present study who became symptomatic post-operatively whether they tested positive or negative did have a significantly prolonged LOS, intubation time, and more freqeuent respiratory complications. This is consistent with previously published studies in the literature, suggesting that screening should not be routinely employed unless respiratory symptoms are present [3\u20136, 14].",

            "text": "Similar to previous studies, HRV was the most common virus detected in our study when multiplex molecular testing is utilized. In 2016 Self et al. investigated the prevalence of respiratory viruses in 832 children with community acquired pneumonia and used 521 asymptomatic children as controls. They identified a virus in 69% of children with pneumonia and 25% of asymptomatic controls. HRV was the most common virus identified in the asymptomatic control group, accounting for over 70% of the viral isolates [17]. Interestingly, this same study also showed that asymptomatic HRV detection declines with increasing age, as HRV was detected in 24% of asymptomatic children less than 2 years of age, while in only 0.8% of adults older than 18 years of age [16]. The presence of HRV (+)PCR test result in otherwise asymptomatic children does not necessarily represent at an \u201cat risk\u201d group of patients. This is especially true in light of the fact that HRV has shown to persist in 50% of children for up to 2 weeks beyond the acute infection [12]. However, unlike HRV, RSV, HMPV, and PIV viruses are considerably more short-lived and rapidly cleared from the respiratory tract after an infection [18]. In a 2014 Swedish study, Influenza, RSV, and HMPV were identified in less than 1% of 209 asymptomatic controls [19]. Thus, unlike HRV, they are rarely detected in asymptomatic children; however, if identified, they almost always progress to clinically evident respiratory disease [17, 18]. With the advent of molecular testing, postponing surgery in PCR(+) HRV infants could result in the inappropriate delay of timely cardiac surgery. Future studies will need to address at what age PCR(+) testing for HRV may in fact predict adverse outcomes. While our study did not show a difference in outcomes for infants with RSV, HMPV, or PIV identified pre-operatively, our numbers were quite small. Further study is needed to determine if detection of these viruses prior to surgery should be considered in the decision-making to proceed with surgery.",

In similar fashion to our study, Malviya et al. used a questionnaire to identify children with active URI symptoms presenting for cardiac surgery. Not surprisingly they found children with URIs had a higher incidence of respiratory complications, longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay compared to those without symptoms [21]. It is possible that our questionnaire was too broad, and a more targeted questionnaire would more accurately predict post-operative risk; this may merit further study. In addition, in our study, the use of supplemental oxygen was a frequent practice both pre- and post-operatively due to the location of the hospital at high altitude.
