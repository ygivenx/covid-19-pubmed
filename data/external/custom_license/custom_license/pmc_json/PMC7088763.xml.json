The authors started by describing tumor-specific antigens that are unique to head and neck cancers. Using these tumor-specific antigens as targets, a comprehensive coverage of beneficial immune responses is presented. With estimated 600,000 cases of head and neck cancer cases annually in the world and the relative lack of effective treatment, this review is not only timely but also brings into the picture on-going as well as potentially exciting treatment directions.",

For example, there was a large-scale HFMD outbreak in 1998 in Taiwan with 78 deaths [2]. Pyridyl imidazolidinones have previously been described as a novel class of EV71-selective inhibitors [3]. These compounds bind in a hydrophobic pocket of the viral VP1 capsid protein, which can acquire resistance mutations. The current study by Chen et al. [4] provides a comprehensive analysis of the effect of 11 drug variants on VP1-mutated EV71 variants. It confirms the importance of hydrophobic forces and the fit into the hydrophobic pockets of VP1 for drug efficacy. Whereas amino acid substitutions at VP1 position 192 can provide resistance, some drugs were identified that remain active on this VP1 variant.",

Infection of SARS-CoV causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is an emerging infectious disease and characterized by a cascade of immunological events leading to pulmonary inflammation and respiratory failure [5]. Expression of M and E proteins of SARS-CoV in insect cells is able to form virus-like particles, indicating that the M protein plays a crucial role in virion assembly [6]. Ma et al. [7] demonstrates that the translated products of M protein contain full-length un-glycosylated and glycosylated protein. The glycosylation of M protein occurs co-translationally in the presence of microsomes. The second and third trans-membrane regions (a.a. 46\u201368 and 78\u2013100) are able to insert a cytoplasmic protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane more efficiently than the first one (a.a. 14\u201336).",

Persistent human hepatitis B viral infection leads to a high risk of developing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Three different kinds of viral and subviral particles are present in patients\u2019 sera. The 42-nm Dane particle, infectious virion, is composed of a 31-nm nucleocapsid with genome inside and a lipid bilayer envelope containing large, middle and major (small) surface antigens. The 22-nm subviral spherical and filamentous particles, which are 1,000- to 10,000-fold excess of Dane particles, do not contain nucleocapsid. However, electron microscopy (EM) studies on the morphogenesis of these particles are few due to the low rate of virion production in livers and transfected cells [8]. Liou et al. [9] described the morphogenesis of HBV virion and subviral particles in the liver of transgenic mice using cryo-ultrathin section EM. Their results demonstrate that the morphogenesis of virions and subviral particles are through two separate pathways.",

BioMap is an integrated software system that performs basic literature mining tasks on Medline database [12]. Palakal et al. [13] developed several new features as well as a new interface for BioMap. They used cdc2 interacting protein in Xenopus laevis as an example to show that this new version of BioMap indeed generated more homologue sequences for interacting proteins for cdc2 and suggested that these results are more reliable and are also consistent with the public domain software.",

In the present study it was found that AS2O3-induced c-Jun (Ser 63/73) phosphorylation can recruit TGIF/HDAC1 to the SP-1 binding sites and suppress p21 promotor activation [14]. It suggests that after AS2O3 treatment, the N-terminal domain of c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK recruits TGIF/HDAC1 to the SPI sites and then represses p21 expression. Therefore, TGIF is involved in AS2O3 -inhibited p21 expression, and then blocks the cell cycle arrest.",

Results of this study demonstrated that the treatment with MSC and BMC groups had significantly reduced lesion tissue score, increased capillary density and normal (not-atrophied) myocytes, as compared to NM and C groups. The survival rate was higher in C, NM and MSC groups as compared to MI and BM groups. In situ injection of both MSCs and BMCs resulted in improved cardiac morphology, in a more physiological model of myocardial infarction represented by surgical coronary occlusion of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Only treatment with MSCs, however, ameliorated left ventricle dysfunction, suggesting a positive role of these cells in heart remodeling in infarcted hypertensive subjects [23].",

However, this gastropathy has also been reported to be caused by neutrophil activation, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). Recently, leptin has been reported to have protective effects in several gastric injuries. This study [29] examined the gastroprotective effects of leptin in indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer and found that it did have protective effects through the production of mucin and induction of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and glutathione peroxidase. These results suggest that leptin can prevent indomethacin-induced injury through interfering with neutrophil infiltration, NO production and oxidative stress.
