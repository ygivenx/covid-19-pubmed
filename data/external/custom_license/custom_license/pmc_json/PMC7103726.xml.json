They are also known as dihydropyrazoles and their chemistry are closely related to pyrazoles. According to heterocyclic nomenclature, pyrazolines require that the nitrogen atoms to be numbered 1 and 2 in each structure. There are three well-known tautomeric structures for pyrazolines namely: 1-pyrazoline, 2-pyrazoline and 3-pyrazoline (Figure 1). However, among these tautomeric structures, 2-pyrazoline is the most common.",

The reaction of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones with hydrazines became one of the most popular methods for the preparation of 2-pyrazolines [7,8]. In this method, hydrazones are formed as intermediates, which can be subsequently cyclized to 2-pyrazolines in the presence of a suitable cyclizing reagent like acetic acid. An alternative route involves 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrileimines to carbon\u2013carbon double bond of arylmethylene (arylidene derivatives of active methylene) compounds as well as acrylic and cinnamic acid derivatives [9-15]. The discovery of this class of compounds and considering their efficiency as drugs provides an outstanding case history of modern drug developments and also points out the unpredictability of pharmacological activity from structural modification of a prototype drug molecule. In general, pyrazoline derivatives display a broad spectrum of potential pharmacological activities and have wide medical applications.",
