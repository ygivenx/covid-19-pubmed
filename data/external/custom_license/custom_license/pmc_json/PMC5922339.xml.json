It has a histopathological pattern that is characterised by intra-alveolar fibrin associated with mononuclear cell infiltrates and loose intraluminal connective tissue with a patchy distribution. AFOP lacks the hyaline membranes that are classically seen in the subacute phase of DAD; it does not have intra-bronchiolar fibrosis (as seen in OP), or prominent infiltration with eosinophils (as seen in eosinophilic pneumonia). AFOP has been linked to various conditions including infections, drug toxicity, and occupational exposures.",

The most significant barrier to long-term survival following lung transplantation is susceptibility to chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), the predominant cause of which is obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) that leads to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). BOS is characterised by airflow obstruction that usually progresses over time, and is the leading cause of allograft loss and recipient death [2,3]. However, allograft pathologies other than BOS/OB have also been reported as a cause of CLAD. These include restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), which has been associated with DAD as a precursor lesion and leads to a restrictive pattern of allograft dysfunction with a prognosis that is worse than that for CLAD caused by BOS [4,5]. More recently, Paraskeva et al. [6] identified 87 recipients in a cohort of 194 bilateral lung transplant recipients who developed CLAD; 22 of these patients had a restrictive pattern of allograft dysfunction and were found to have AFOP by histopathologic and radiographic criteria. The recipients who developed AFOP had significantly worse post-transplant survival than a cohort of 39 recipients who developed BOS/OB.",

            "text": "Beasley and colleagues [1] described AFOP as a new histopathologic entity in 2002 and concluded that it represented an unusual variant of ALI. OP is characterised by buds of granulation tissue (comprised of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in a matrix of loose connective tissue) in distal airspaces (alveolar ducts, alveoli, and bronchioles) that may be idiopathic (cryptogenic organising pneumonia [COP]) [8,9]. OP has been associated with a variety of clinical entities such as infection, connective tissue disorders, or pneumotoxic drug reactions [9]. DAD has also been associated with a number of clinical disorders such as infection or drug toxicity; it is characterised by alveolar epithelial cell and endothelial injury with fluid and cellular exudation followed by reparative fibroblast proliferation and alveolar type II pneumocyte hyperplasia [10]. Hyaline membrane formation marks the exudative phase of DAD. AFOP is characterised histopathologically by intra-alveolar fibrin (in the form of fibrin \u201cballs\u201d) within the alveolar spaces [11]. The presence of the fibrin balls differentiates AFOP from classical OP (with its granulation tissue in the bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli) as well as from DAD (with its classic hyaline membranes). Patchy distribution of fibrin deposition is typical and involves 25\u201390% of alveolar spaces, averaging 50% of airspace involvement overall. In contrast to AFOP, DAD is typically diffuse. Although AFOP lacks the classic hyaline membranes that characterise DAD, myxoid fibroblastic tissue has been identified in the alveolar walls in both AFOP and DAD. Eosinophils are typically present, but not predominant as with eosinophilic pneumonitis.",

Other associations include stem cell transplantation, haematologic malignancy, occupational exposures, and cigarette smoking [13,14]. Although AFOP often runs a rapid and fatal course, responses to pharmacologic interventions have been reported.

Another possibility is that AFOP represented a form of allograft rejection, although these patients had ongoing intense immunosuppression and various complications associated with their lung transplant status, and 3 of the 6 patients did not have improvement with intensified immune suppression. None of our subjects received drugs that have been linked to AFOP in published literature. Additionally, none of the surgical or TBB specimens revealed a consistent association with acute rejection or lymphocytic bronchiolitis. Because of the intense immunosuppression and multiple drugs that our lung transplant recipients were receiving, plus the numerous drugs (many associated with potential pulmonary toxicity) they were taking for management of their post-transplant issues as well as ongoing colonisation and/or infection with potential pathogens, it is difficult to associate AFOP with any specific cause. Only 1 of our 6 patients stabilised and appeared to recover. Her dyspnoea, infiltration on chest radiographs, and gas exchange were rapidly worsening, but she stabilised and gradually improved when intensified immunosuppression (intravenous methylprednisolone and subsequent gradual prednisone taper) was given. A point of interest is the infrequent occurrence of AFOP in our recipient population (6 of 561 [1%]) as compared to the report by Paraskeva et al. (22 of 194 [11%]) [6].",

[4] used a \u226510% decline in baseline total lung capacity (TLC) to indicate the presence of restrictive physiology in addition to the presence of radiographic infiltrates on chest imaging and DAD on histopathology as diagnostic of the RAS form of CLAD. Although we did not measure lung volumes in our cohort of recipients with AFOP, the clear decline of both FEV1 along with forced vital capacity (FVC) in 4 of the 6 subjects is consistent with restrictive physiology. Because most centres do not measure lung volumes and many factors can confound measurements of TLC, we suggest that the combination of spirometry, imaging findings, and histopathology can be used to identify AFOP and differentiate it from the RAS or the classical obstructive BOS/OB phenotypes of CLAD [3]. Our experience plus that reported by Paraskeva et al. [6] indicates that AFOP should be considered as a diagnosis in transplant recipients who develop allograft dysfunction when clinical evaluation suggests that CLAD associated with restrictive physiology and radiographic infiltrates has developed. Although upper lobe infiltrates in this setting are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of RAS [4,6], lung biopsy is required to differentiate AFOP from RAS.",

However, 3 of our recipients had serious infectious complications and/or episodes of allograft rejection prior to or during the onset of AFOP. We conclude that histopathologic changes consistent with AFOP can bet associated with persistent post-transplant decline in allograft function; that recipients who develop AFOP may meet criteria that are consistent with a diagnosis of CLAD with clinical characteristics that can overlap with the RAS subset of CLAD, (infiltrates on HRCT, decline in FVC consistent with ventilatory restriction); that it occurs infrequently; and that its appearance is associated with a poor prognosis. Further characterisation of the AFOP phenotype of CLAD may assist efforts to prevent and/or treat this potential complication of lung transplantation.",
