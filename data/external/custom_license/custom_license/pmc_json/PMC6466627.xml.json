SiRNA knockdown of IFITM1, 2 and 3 together has also been reported to increase Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in macrophages.9 Moreover, IFITM3 was shown to associate with Mtb in late endosomal compartments and was shown to restrict Mtb by imaging flow cytometry.9 IFITMs are active in multiple mammalian cell types, including primary CD8+ T cells and respiratory DCs directly involved in adaptive immunity to IAV.10 Notably, ifitm3\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to infection by IAV.11, 12 Moreover, IFITM3 appears to be important for the intrinsic and inducible antiviral activity of human embryonic stem cells.13 IFITMs have also been suggested to limit virus infection in a variety of other vertebrates,1, 3 highlighting their possible evolutionarily-conserved function in host immunity.",

            "text": "IFITMs encode relatively small membrane proteins (107 \u2013 144 amino acids)1 that were originally predicted to be dual-pass transmembrane proteins based on two hydrophobic domains2 (Fig. 1a). However, subsequent epitope mapping studies in cells14\u201316 and preliminary structural studies in vitro17 have suggested that IFITMs are type IV membrane proteins in which only the second hydrophobic domain is a transmembrane domain, with the C-terminus facing outside of cells. In contrast, the first hydrophobic domain of IFITM3 is suggested to function as an amphipathic helix and regulate interactions with the inner leaflet of host membranes.18 This IFITM membrane topology model is also supported by the discovery of posttranslational modifications on IFITM3 (S-fatty-acylation of Cys71, 72 and 105, phosphorylation of Tyr20, ubiquitination of Lys24, 83, 88 and 104 as well as methylation of Lys88).19 In mammalian cells, IFITM2 and 3 are mostly distributed through early and late endocytic vesicles and on lysosomes by immunofluorescence1, 3, 19 and live cell imaging studies20. IFITM1 has a truncated N-terminus and lacks an AP2 sorting motif (YXX\u03a6) found in IFITM2 and 3, and shows more plasma membrane localization.1, 3, 19 The cellular localization of the IFITMs may be a crucial determinant for their specificities towards viruses, since IFITM1 is more active against viruses that enter through the plasma membrane or early endocytic vesicles, whereas IFITM2 and 3 are more active against viruses that enter within late endocytic compartments.1, 3, 19 In humans, individuals with the IFITM3 SNP rs12252-C allele, which encodes a predicted 21-amino acid truncation of the N-terminus (IFITM3-N21\u0394), show increased morbidity and mortality to H1N1 strains of IAV.12 The IFITM3 rs12252-C allele is more prevalent in Asian populations21 and is associated with fatal IAV H7N9 infection22, 23 as well as acute HIV-1 infection24. However, recent meta-analyses25\u201327, overexpression studies28 and direct transcript analysis29 have challenged the significance of this allele in humans. Further studies of IFITM3 SNPs have identified rs34481144 as another loss-of-function allele in the IFITM3 5\u2019 UTR that results in lower mRNA expression, which correlates with reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells in patient airways and increased severity of influenza-mediated illness30. These studies highlight that IFITMs are highly regulated in mammalian cells and important for host susceptibility to diverse pathogens.",

            "text": "While expression levels, subcellular localization and mutation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 clearly modulate host susceptibility towards different viruses, the precise cellular and biochemical mechanisms by which IFITMs inhibit virus entry in IFN-stimulated cells are still unclear1. Overexpression studies showed that IFITMs do not affect the expression levels of host ligands/receptors for viruses (e.g. sialic acid levels)2 or uptake of IAV particles into mammalian cells31, suggesting that these small membrane proteins may interfere with intermediate or late stages of virus entry rather than initial binding or internalization into host cells. Notably, overexpression of IFITM3 appears to arrest internalized virus particles within endocytic vesicles and prevent the translocation of viral contents into the cytosol.31 Overexpression studies have also suggested that IFITM3 expands Rab7- and LAMP1-positive late endocytic compartments31 and potentially alters the localization and activity of v-ATPase32, without affecting lysosomal cathepsin activity33. Alternatively, overexpression studies have also suggested that IFITMs can influence cell-cell fusion34 or indirectly alter intracellular cholesterol homeostasis35 to block viral hemifusion with host membranes. However, live cell imaging of IAV entry and lipid mixing has shown that IFITMs do not affect virus hemifusion in endosomes36 or localization to endosomes37, indicating a possible role in blocking fusion pore formation. Interestingly, IFITMs may also be incorporated in HIV-1 virions and other viruses to inhibit virus spreading or transferred through exosomes to propagate antiviral activity to neighboring cells.38 The broad activity of IFITMs against different classes of viruses and perhaps even intracellular bacterial pathogens suggests a general mechanism of action that is functional in many different cell types. However, the lack of IFITM1, 2 and 3 mutant cell lines and tools for live imaging of IFITMs has limited their direct mechanistic investigation in host cells during infection as well as dissection of their regulatory mechanisms.",

We discovered that IFITM1, 2 and 3 act cooperatively in IFN-stimulated cells against diverse viruses (IAV, VSV, DENV, WNV, ZIKV) and enhance the trafficking of both endogenous (activated EGFR) and exogenous (virus particles) cargo in late endocytic vesicles to lysosomes for degradation. Using live cell IFITM3 imaging experiments, we observed that internalized IAV particles primarily undergo lipid mixing or hemifusion with host membranes after fusion of virus-bearing vesicles with IFITM3-positive vesicles. The pre-fusion colocalization of virus particles with IFITM3-positive vesicles was specific to restricted viruses (IAV and EBOV) and was markedly decreased with loss-of-function IFITM3 mutants such as the N21\u0394 SNP rs12252-C allele. We also demonstrated that site-specific S-fatty-acylation of Cys72 is important for IFITM3 trafficking to incoming IAV particles. Collectively, our results showed that IFITM3 can engage vesicles bearing incoming virus particles and promote shuttling of late endocytic cargo to lysosomes for degradation, which highlights a general mechanism by which IFITMs may intercept pathogens and prevent their entry into host cells. These studies were uniquely enabled by site-specific protein labeling and imaging methods, which should also facilitate the functional analysis of other host factors involved in pathogen restriction as well as their mechanisms of regulation.",

Amongst the gRNAs we evaluated targeting exon 1 of human IFITM3 (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1b), gRNA3 afforded the most efficient cleavage of genomic IFITM3 (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1c). Western blot analysis of CRISPR-Cas9-gRNA3 transfected stable cell clones after puromycin selection yielded several HeLa and A549 clones with decreased and/or deleted IFITM2 and 3 using an N-terminally-directed antibody that cross-reacts with both proteins (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1d). Since human IFITM2 and 3 have high sequence identity in their first exons and also flank IFITM1 on chromosome 11, we evaluated the expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 using isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 1b). From this analysis, we identified HeLa cell clones with reduced expression in IFITM2 (C4\u20134) or IFITM3 (C345\u20135), or both (C5\u20132, IFITM2/3-KO), as well as one clone that showed loss of IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression (C5\u20139) compared to Cas9-empty vector-treated HeLa cells (WT HeLa) (Fig. 1b). For A549 cells, we only isolated IFITM2/IFITM3 double KO clones with partially reduced expression of IFITM1 (C1\u20133) (Fig. 1c). A summary of the IFITM2 and 3 mutations in these HeLa and A549 mutant cell lines is included (Supplementary Results, Table 1).",

            "text": "We next evaluated the virus susceptibility of these HeLa and A549 IFITM (1, 2 and 3) mutant cell lines with and without IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Infection of the HeLa cell clones with IAV (A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) strain) showed that reduced expression of IFITM2 or IFITM3 increased virus susceptibility approximately 2- or 4-fold, respectively, compared to controls (Fig. 1d\nand\nSupplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1e). However, HeLa cell clones with complete loss of IFITM2 and 3 (C5-2, IFITM2/3-KO) or all three isoforms (C5-9) exhibited greater than 20-fold increased infection, as judged by anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) staining (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1e). The cooperative antiviral activity among IFITMs was even more pronounced in IFN-\u03b1 treated cells, in which reduced expression of IFITM2 or IFITM3 alone did not have a significant effect on IAV infection, whereas deletion of both or all three isoforms again resulted in greater than 20-fold increased susceptibility (Fig. 1d\nand\nSupplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1e). No significant difference in IAV infection of clones with KO of IFITM2/3 (C5-2,) or all three isoforms (C5-9) was observed, even with IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Fig. 1d\nand\nSupplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1e), suggesting that IFITM1 does not play a significant role in preventing IAV infection. In contrast, the analysis of IFITM mutant cell lines with other viruses showed that VSV and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) infected na\u00efve HeLa cell clones at similar levels, but with IFN-\u03b1 treatment, reduced expression or deletion of IFITM1, 2 or 3 increased infection, particularly when all three isoforms were deleted (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1f). DENV also showed increased infectivity in the na\u00efve IFITM-mutant HeLa cell lines (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1f). However, loss of IFITM2 or 3 expression alone in IFN-\u03b1 treated cells only partially attenuated DENV infection compared to HeLa cells without IFITM1, 2 and 3 (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1f). YFV and o\u2019nyong\u2019nyong virus (ONNV) showed enhanced infection of na\u00efve IFITM-mutant cells but were attenuated with IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1f), suggesting that other IFN-effectors also contribute to host restriction of these viruses. We observed similar trends with virus infections of na\u00efve and IFN-\u03b1 treated IFITM2/3-mutant A549 cells compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 1g). To confirm that the virus susceptibility was indeed due to reduced expression or deletion of IFITM2 or 3, we generated stable clones reconstituted with IFITM2 or 3. In the HeLa IFITM2/3-KO clone (C5-2), we generated cells expressing low, medium or near-WT levels of IFITM3 and a clone expressing only IFITM2 (Fig. 1e). IAV infection of these HeLa cell lines showed dose-dependent antiviral activity by IFITM3 and that IFITM3 or IFITM2 expression alone was sufficient to render these IFITM2/3-KO HeLa and A549 cells resistant to virus infection (Fig. 1f). These results show that human IFITM3 functions in a dose-dependent manner and may be redundant with IFITM2 towards some viruses, but it may act synergistically with IFITM1 to restrict a broad spectrum of viruses in IFN-stimulated cells. At endogenous levels in IFN-stimulated cells, IFITM2 and 3 are most important for IAV and VEEV, whereas all three IFITMs are involved in preventing VSV and DENV infection.",

Immunofluorescence analysis showed that endogenous as well as reconstituted IFITM3 is present on intracellular vesicular structures that partially colocalize with CD63-positive late endocytic compartments in IFN-\u03b1 treated A549 cells (Fig. 2a). Fluorescence imaging of endocytic markers (GFP-Rab5a, GFP-Rab7a and LAMP1-mCherry) did not show significant differences in the distribution of early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes between A549 WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). We also did not observe significant enlargement or expansion of LAMP1-mCherry compartments in IFN-\u03b1 treated control cells compared to IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), in contrast to previous IFITM3 overexpression studies31. Moreover, the uptake of exogenous cargo (dextran particles) was similar between IFN-\u03b1 treated WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). IFN-\u03b1 treated WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells also exhibited similar labeling with fluorogenic cell-penetrating peptides that enter through the endocytic pathway39 (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 3). These results collectively suggest that IFITM2/3 do not significantly regulate early endocytic events or generally alter endocytic vesicle membrane permeability.",

            "text": "Since early endocytic events are not affected and endogenous IFITM3 is mainly localized to late endosomes or lysosomes, we evaluated whether IFITM2/3 may affect late endocytic vesicle cargo trafficking and degradation. Our initial pulse-chase labeling studies with fluorescent dextran particles suggested that exogenous cargo trafficking to lysosomes was modestly delayed in IFN-\u03b1 treated IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). To evaluate the trafficking and degradation of endogenous endocytic cargo, we focused on the turnover of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is one of the major sialylated cell surface receptors for IAV40 and is readily detectable in A549 cells. While the cell surface levels of EGFR were similar (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 4a), following EGF-stimulation of IFN-\u03b1 treated A549 cells, EGFR was largely degraded after 90 minutes (Fig. 2b,c). Notably, EGFR turnover was markedly delayed in IFN-\u03b1 treated IFITM2/3-KO cells, with significant levels still present after 90 minutes (Fig. 2b,c). Stable reconstitution of IFITM3 in IFN-\u03b1 treated IFITM2/3-KO cells rescued and even accelerated the degradation of EGFR (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast, treatment of these cells with transferrin (Tf) in the same time frame (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 4b,c), suggests IFITM2/3 do not significantly affect the turnover of activated transferrin receptor (TfR, CD71), a GPI-anchor modified membrane protein that is recycled to the plasma membrane. Analysis of lysosomal protease activity using a fluorogenic cathepsin B substrate and cysteine protease activity-based profiling showed similar levels of endolysosomal proteolytic activity in IFN-\u03b1 treated A549 and HeLa cells regardless of IFITM2/3 expression levels (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). These data together with pulse-chase analysis of fluorescent-dextran particles suggest IFITM2/3 do not significantly alter endolysosomal protease activity but may enhance the trafficking of late endocytic cargo to lysosomes for degradation, even in the absence of virus infection.",

Using a membrane-incorporated dye, 1,1\u2019-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2019,3\u2019-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD), that readily labels IAV particles in vitro (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 5) and exhibits fluorescence dequenching upon hemifusion or full fusion between viral and endosomal membranes41, we were able to track viral membrane fusion, as indicated by glycoprotein-mediated lipid mixing, and monitor the trafficking of virus-fused vesicles. Because IAV is known to fuse with late endosomes, we first evaluated IAV lipid mixing and trafficking in WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells transduced to express LAMP1-GFP. These experiments were performed in HeLa cells, which exhibit less contour than A549 cells and enabled more comprehensive quantitative imaging of DiD-IAV particles by wide-field epifluorescence microscopy. IAV lipid mixing occurred almost exclusively in LAMP1-positive compartments (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Results, Supplementary Movie 1). The rate at which IAV particles underwent lipid mixing was similar in WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells (Fig. 3c, black and white circles), with a t1/2 of approximately 41 min for both. In IFN-\u03b1 treated cells, the DiD-IAV dequenching rate was delayed in IFITM2/3-KO HeLa cells compared to WT cells (Fig. 3c, black and white squares). The t1/2 for lipid mixing in IFN-treated IFITM2/3-KO HeLa cells occurred 11 min later than in WT cells. Moreover, the trafficking of DiD-IAV particles to LAMP1-positive compartments in IFN-\u03b1 treated WT HeLa cells was also on average ~10 min faster, even though virus trafficking times may vary widely even in synchronized-infections (Fig. 3d). No significant difference in trafficking of DiD-IAV particles to LAMP1-positive compartments was observed in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3d). While IFN-\u03b1 treatment reduced the relative amount of dequenched DiD-IAV particles, the percentage of dequenched DiD-IAV particles (Fig. 3e) and the degree of colocalization with LAMP1-positive compartments were similar between HeLa WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells at 2 h post-infection (Fig. 3f). These results show that IFN-\u03b1 treatment impacts the kinetics but not total extent of viral lipid mixing in IFITM2/3-KO cells versus WT cells, which suggests that IFITM2/3 primarily influences the rate of virus trafficking to late endosomal compartments rather than the gross composition of the endosomal milieu, consistent with our data on dextran particle trafficking (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 2c,d) EGFR (Fig. 2b,c) and TfR turnover (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 4b,c).",

Briefly, the transfection of mammalian cells with plasmids encoding with HA-IFITM3-F8-TAG with Mm-PylRS-AF/Pyl-tRNACUA plasmids enables site-specific incorporation of trans-cyclooct-2-ene-lysine (TCOK) and subsequent bioorthogonal labeling with BODIPY-tetrazine (BODIPY-Tz) (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 7). Importantly, HA-IFITM3-F8-TCOK labeled with BODIPY-Tz retains antiviral activity towards IAV (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 8a). The analysis of IFITM3 expression levels by \u03b1-IFITM3 antibody staining showed that HA-IFITM3 site-specifically labeled with TCOK in IFITM2/3-KO cells yielded slightly lower levels of total protein compared to WT HeLa cells + IFN-\u03b1 by western blot and flow cytometry analysis (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 8b,c) and similar pattern of vesicle staining by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 8d).

            "text": "We then performed these imaging studies in IFITM2/3-KO cells, which enabled us to monitor all IFITM3-positive compartments and avoid potential heterotypic interactions with endogenous IFITMs. Live imaging of IFITM2/3-KO cells revealed that relatively little BODIPY-IFITM3 colocalized with Rab5 at steady-state (Manders correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.45 \u00b1 0.13) (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 9). Instead, significantly greater overlap of BODIPY-IFITM3 with Rab7 (MCC 0.98 \u00b1 0.06) and LAMP1 (MCC 0.97 \u00b1 0.03) was observed (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 9), which shows that IFITM3 largely resides in late endocytic vesicles and is consistent with previous immunofluorescence9, 16, 33, 35 and live cell imaging studies of IFITM3 in WT HeLa cells20. Using DiD-labeled IAV and epifluorescence imaging, we observed BODIPY-IFITM3 colocalization with the majority of internalized virus particles prior to lipid mixing (Fig. 4a,b\nand\nSupplementary Results, Supplementary Movie 2), with another 20 percent of DiD-dequenching events occurring in compartments without detectable BODIPY-IFITM3 (Fig. 4c). In these latter events, BODIPY-IFITM3 vesicles were observed to colocalize with DiD-dequenched puncta later in time, where secondary DiD dequenching events could occasionally be observed (Fig. 4d\nand\nSupplementary Results, Supplementary Movie 3). This secondary DiD-dequenching likely represents further dye diffusion due to endosome fusion with an IFITM3-positive vesicle and expansion of the limiting membrane. Reintroduction of IFITM3 into HeLa IFITM2/3-KO cells did not significantly alter the total percentage of IAV particles undergoing lipid mixing by 2 h post-infection (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 10a). Consistent with our previous experiments (Fig. 3), these results show that while virus particles may fuse with IFITM3-positive vesicles, IFITM3 does not significantly inhibit IAV lipid mixing or hemifusion with endocytic membranes. More importantly, IFITM3 colocalized with nearly 80 percent of DiD-IAV particles at the time of lipid mixing (Fig. 4e), but this was markedly decreased with VSV particles pseudotyped with the glycoprotein complex (GPC) of Lassa virus (LASV), a late-penetrating arenavirus that is not restricted by IFITMs2 (Fig. 4e\nand\nSupplementary Results, Supplementary Movie 4). In these experiments, both IAV and LASV GPC-pseudotyped VSV still trafficked to late endocytic compartments, as indicated by colocalization with LAMP1 (Fig. 4e), and the extent of colocalization of both viruses with IFITM3 at 1 hour post-infection was similar (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 10b). However, most LASV GPC-bearing particles dequenched before their endosomes acquired IFITM3 (Fig. 4f), while IAV dequenching generally occurred shortly after colocalization with IFITM3 (Fig. 4f). To further investigate the specificity of IFITM3 trafficking towards restricted viruses, we analyzed VSV particles pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of Ebola virus (EBOV), a late endosome/lysosome entering virus that is restricted by IFITM333, 42. Like IAV, the majority of DiD-EBOV particles colocalized with IFITM3 prior lipid mixing (Fig. 4e,f). These results demonstrate for the first time that incoming virus particles interact with IFITM3-positive vesicles prior to fusion and that this phenomenon is specific to restricted viruses such as IAV and EBOV.",

In particular, we evaluated the rs12252-C allele of IFITM3 that yields an N21\u0394 truncation mutant and is suggested to affect host cell susceptibility to IAV infection.12, 43 Stable expression of IFITM3-N21\u0394 in A549 IFITM2/3-KO cells revealed more peripheral plasma membrane distribution (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 11a), lower protein levels and reduced antiviral activity against IAV compared to WT IFITM3 (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 11b,c), consistent with previous studies12, 43. Moreover, IFITM3-N21\u0394 also exhibited decreased antiviral activity towards IAV and ZIKV compared to similar levels of full length IFITM2 or IFITM3 in HeLa IFITM2/3-KO (C5-2) cells (Fig. 5a-c). To analyze IFITM3-N21\u0394 trafficking during IAV infection, we generated HA-IFITM3-N21\u0394-V93-TAG construct for site-specific fluorophore labeling with BODIPY-Tz. While wide-field epifluorescence microscopy showed the BODIPY-labeled IFITM3 constructs were primarily in intracellular vesicles (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 12), confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that HA-IFITM3-N21\u0394-V93-BODIPY exhibited slightly more co-staining with a plasma membrane marker compared to the HA-IFITM3-F8-BODIPY and HA-IFITM3-V93-BODIPY constructs (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). For DiD-IAV imaging studies, we observed a 55 percent reduction in the number of IAV particles colocalized with IFITM3-N21\u0394 at the time of lipid mixing versus WT IFITM3 (Fig. 5d-f), indicating that the truncated protein is less likely to be incorporated into, but not completely absent from, endosomal compartments supporting viral fusion (Fig. 5d-f). Reintroduction of WT IFITM3 and IFITM3-N21\u0394 into HeLa IFITM2/3-KO cells also did not significantly alter the total percentage of IAV particles undergoing lipid mixing by 2 h post-infection (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 10c). These results demonstrate that a quantitative difference in IFITM3 trafficking to incoming virus particles is correlated with altered steady-state localization and antiviral activity, further suggesting that direct engagement or fusion of IFITM3-positive vesicles with pathogens is important for its cellular mechanism of action.",

            "text": "To further investigate mechanisms that control IFITM3 trafficking to virus particles, we analyzed site-specific mutants of S-palmitoylation.14, 44, 45 Previous studies from our group demonstrated that Cys72 on human IFITM3 is the most prominent site of S-palmitoylation45, 46 and is crucial for antiviral activity towards IAV45, 47 as well as DENV47. However, the mechanism by which site-specific S-palmitoylation regulates IFITM3 antiviral activity is unclear, since similar levels of steady-state protein expression and cellular localization patterns were observed with WT IFITM3 and individual Ala mutants at Cys71, 72 and 105.45 We therefore generated F8-TAG constructs of these IFITM3 Cys-to-Ala mutants and analyzed their trafficking properties during IAV entry. These IFITM3 Cys-to-Ala mutants were expressed at similar levels to WT IFITM3-F8-TAG and showed decreased levels of S-fatty-acylation in HeLa IFITM2/3-KO (C5-2) cells, particularly with the Cys72-Ala (C72A) mutant (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 14a,b). Although the relative levels of site-specific S-fatty-acylation on these TAG-modified constructs of human IFITM3 are less dramatic than our previous studies with murine IFITM3,45 Cys72 is still the most prominent site of modification.46 Importantly, mutation of Cys72 to Ala most significantly decreased the antiviral activity of IFITM3 towards IAV, whereas Cys71 and 105 Ala mutants retained more activity (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 14c), consistent with previous studies from our group45 and others47.45, 47 The steady-state localization of these BODIPY-labeled constructs was similar to WT IFITM3 (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 9\nand\n15). However, the trafficking and colocalization of the IFITM3-C72A mutant with dequenched DiD-IAV particles were significantly decreased to ~20 percent compared to WT IFITM3 or Ala mutants at Cys71 and 105 (Fig. 6\nand\nSupplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 16). In comparison to WT, IFITM3-C72A mutant trafficking to DiD-IAV particles was also delayed (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig. 14d). These results show that while S-fatty-acylation does not significantly affect IFITM3 steady-state cellular distribution, site-specific S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 at Cys72 is important for its rate of trafficking to IAV particles during infection, which was only revealed by site-specific fluorophore labeling and live cell imaging.",

            "text": "IFITM1, 2 and 3 are important IFN-stimulated effectors that prevent diverse virus infections in a variety of vertebrate animals and are emerging as key virus susceptibility factors in humans. Nonetheless, the precise cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action for these small membrane proteins have been challenging to elucidate. By generating single and multiple IFITM-deficient mammalian cell lines, we demonstrated that IFITM2 and 3 may be redundant and act synergistically with IFITM1 towards different restricted viruses in na\u00efve and IFN-\u03b1 stimulated cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these IFITMs function in a dose-dependent fashion and do not affect early stages of exogenous cargo or pathogen uptake, but rather enhance the trafficking and turnover of late endocytic cargo to lysosomes. In the absence of infection, IFITM2/3-deficient cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b1 showed slower rates of EGFR turnover. During IAV infection, we observed that fluorescently-labeled IAV particles enter host cells and undergo hemifusion at similar rates in WT and IFITM2/3-deficient cells, consistent with previous siRNA knockdown studies of IFITM336. However, in IFITM2/3-KO cells we observed that fluorescently-labeled IAV particles traffic approximately 10 minutes more slowly on average to lysosomes. Our findings suggest that beyond potentially inhibiting virus pore formation36, IFITM2/3 may prevent virus entry by altering rates of virus-endosome fusion and/or accelerating the trafficking of endosomal cargo to lysosomes for destruction.",

            "text": "While previous studies have correlated the cellular distribution of IFITM1, 2 or 3 with their antiviral activity, their trafficking and interactions with viruses during infection were unknown. Using site-specific fluorophore labeling of IFITM3 in mammalian cells, we were able to directly visualize IFITM3 trafficking with fluorescently-labeled virus particles and observed for the first time that IFITM3-positive vesicles fuse with incoming virus-bearing vesicles prior to hemifusion. Importantly, the IFITM3-positive vesicle fusion and colocalization prior to hemifusion were specific to restricted viruses such as IAV and pseudotyped EBOV, but not LASV-pseudotyped virus particles, and colocalization was significantly reduced with loss-of-function mutants such as IFITM3-N21\u0394. The ability of IFITMs to engage endosomes bearing incoming virus particles and enhance their trafficking to late endocytic compartments provides an important mechanism to explain the specificity of IFITMs against different viruses and potentially predicts points of viral entry into host cells. Different viruses may therefore initiate fusion in different subsets of late endo/lysosomal compartments and exhibit differential sensitivity to IFN effector expression levels and trafficking properties. These interactions are not readily apparent from bulk viral entry studies, which highlight the utility of our site-specific protein labeling and live single-particle imaging approaches that should facilitate future studies on virus-host factor dynamics.",

            "text": "Our ability to image IFITM3 trafficking in live cells has not only revealed interactions with pathogens during infection but also uncovered how posttranslational modifications regulate the function of these small membrane proteins. We initially discovered IFITM3 S-fatty-acylation14, 44, determined endogenous levels45 and specific sites of modification45, 46, as well as confirmed its modification with palmitic acid46. While these results have also been confirmed by others47\u201349 and also shown for IFITM550, how S-palmitoylation at Cys72 regulated IFITM3 antiviral activity was unclear from steady-state localization studies. Using site-specific fluorophore labeling and live cell imaging during infection, we now observe that inhibition of S-palmitoylation at Cys72, but not Cys71 or 105, by site-directed mutagenesis impairs IFITM3 trafficking to incoming IAV particles and thus reveals how site-specific S-palmitoylation regulates IFITM3 antiviral activity. The chemical imaging approach described here has uncovered important aspects of how IFITMs engage pathogens during infection, as well as key regulatory mechanisms, and should facilitate the analysis of other host factors involved in pathogen restriction. Nonetheless, key questions still remain regarding the cellular pathway and biochemical mechanism by which these IFN-effectors prevent pathogen entry and accelerate trafficking of incoming viral particles to lysosomes for destruction. Our ability to conduct site-specific labeling IFITM3 with unique chemical reactivity should enable additional imaging studies, discovery of specific protein-protein interaction partners and reconstitution of lipidated isoforms for biochemical and structural studies in the future.",
