            "text": "Astrovirus (AstV) is an approximately 30-nm spherical virus with a star-like structure. It has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome comprised of three open reading frames (ORFs) [1]. ORF1a and ORF1b, which code for non-structural proteins, are present on the 5\u2032-terminal side, while ORF2, which codes for a capsid protein is present on the 3\u2032-terminal side. AstV infection has been reported in mammals and birds [3, 7, 8], with the main clinical symptom being diarrhea. In humans, AstV is a cause of infectious gastroenteritis in children [14]. Although the clinical symptoms of human AstV (HAstV) infection are milder than those of norovirus and rotavirus infections, fatal cases of HAstV infection have been reported in immunocompromised pediatric patients [15].",

The dogs in the study conducted in Italy were pups younger than 3 months old, whereas our study included pups aged 1.5 months old to elderly dogs aged 15 years old, with a mean age of 3.9 \u00b1 0.6 years old (mean \u00b1 S.E.).

However, healthy young pups (1 to 3 months old) in which the CAstV gene was not detected have also been reported [16]. The maintenance conditions of the dogs used may have influenced the results, as a possible reason for this contradiction. In our study and that reported by Zhu et al. [16], dogs brought to animal hospitals in major cities such as Tokyo and Shanghai were used, but dogs maintained in a group, such as those in an animal shelter, were not used. It is necessary to investigate the state of CAstV infection under different animal maintenance conditions.\n",
