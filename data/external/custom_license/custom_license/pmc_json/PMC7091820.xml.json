This process is evolutionarily conserved and is found in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms (see for reviews 5, 6). Specific inhibition of cellular mRNA by RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic 21- to 23-nucleotide duplexes of RNA (siRNA) 7, 8. This discovery prompted the use of RNAi for specifically inhibiting gene expression and replication of infectious viruses. The replication of a growing number of human pathogenic viruses in cell culture was shown to be inhibited by RNAi, including poliovirus, HIV-1, HCV replicons, hepatitis B virus and influenza virus 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. The successful use of siRNA in mammalian cells encouraged us to apply RNAi to the exploration of anti-SARS strategies.",

The structural proteins S, E, M and N are common to all known coronavirus, Playing a role in host cell entry and viron morphogenesis and release 21, 22. During viron assembly, N binds to a defined packaging signal on viral RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid. M is localized at intracellular membrane structures. The interaction between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsids results in budding through the membrane. These structural proteins were attractive targets for anti-SARS agent development.",

            "text": "Gene silencing mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a sequence-specific, highly conserved mechanism in eukaryotes. In plants, it serves as an antiviral defence mechanism 27, 28, 29. Recently, the mammalian RNAi machinery has been successfully programmed with siRNAs targeting viral sequences to induce an effective antiviral response. This prompted us to evaluate the effect of siRNA on SARS-CoV. Viruses, especially RNA viruses, are variable due to high mutation rates during replication. The mutated viral proteins can help the viruses to escape immune-system defence mechanisms 30. These mutations may also escape attack by siRNAs. However, the emergence of escape variants resistant to siRNA can be minimized by using siRNA directed against multiple conserved RNA target sequences. The genome of SARS-CoV encoded 23 putative proteins, including four major structural proteins; nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and small envelope (E) which played essential roles in host cell entry, viral morphogenesis and release 21, 22. These structural proteins were attractive targets for anti-SARS agent development. Among these proteins, we selected E, M, and N as the targets of RNAi. The spike protein, a glycoprotein projection on the viral surface, was crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. In addition, variations of S protein among strains of coronavirus are responsible for host range and tissue tropism 31. The results of genetic sequencing of samples from the latest patient with SARS show variation of S gene in this SARS-CoV strain 32. Since the S1 subunit of the spike protein is the major antigenic moiety for coronaviruses and is not an essential structural protein, it is prone to have high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations 33. Therefore we don't chose S protein as a target. In this work, we have evaluated the down-regulation effects of 26 siRNA duplexes targeting different sites along the open reading frames of E, M, and N proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, three siRNA duplexes exhibit over 70% inhibition efficiency, 11 siRNA duplexes showed 40\u223c70% inhibition efficiency, and 12 siRNA duplexes reduced target genes less than 40% at the concentration of 30 nM. By modifying the sense strand of siRNA duplex as shown in Fig. 4, the inhibition efficiency of many siRNA duplexes may be improved. The combined use of siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of the virus may increase the efficiency of the treatment and, in turn, will prevent the appearance of viral revertants resistant to the treatment.",

In this cell model, we obtained sequence-specific downregulation of SARS-CoV genes expression by synthetic siRNA as seen from the results of RT-PCR (Fig. 1) and from a reduced fluorescence intensity of EGFP to which the SARS-CoV protein E, M, or N was fused (Fig. 3). Inhibition was dose dependent in the range of 0\u223c60 nM and was sustained for 3 d after administration of the siRNA (Fig. 2).

The use of RNAi in the therapy of SARS would be advantageous in its specificity for the target gene with minimized side effects. However, the interference of SARS-CoV genes expression induced by the use of siRNA duplexes is transient. It will be essential to prolong the expression of siRNA and to ensure its delivery. Current methods for prolonging siRNA expression include the use of plasmids that express endogenously the siRNAs. An alternative approach is to express the siRNA from an integrating viral vector to achieve continuous and prolonged expression. A recent article 39 published during the preparation of our work for report on the anti-SARS activity of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the S gene expressed from a U6 promoter suggest that RNAi has potential to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV from the infected Vero E6 cells. In some cases there may be an advantage to using siRNA because of safety issues regarding the administration of foreign DNA into a patient.",
