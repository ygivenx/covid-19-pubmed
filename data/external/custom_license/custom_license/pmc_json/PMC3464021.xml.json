Infection is more likely to be transmitted between genetically similar hosts (Anderson and May, 1986), and upon encountering resistant hosts, parasites would likely die, fail to successfully reproduce (Anderson and May, 1986), or otherwise be removed from the population (Keesing et al., 2006). As such, the risk of infection, especially by virulent pathogens, may select for outcrossing over uniparental forms reproduction, such as self-fertilization or parthenogenesis (Jokela et al., 2009; King et al., 2009; Morran et al., 2011), resulting in an overall increase in genetic diversity (King et al., 2011). There may not seem to be an escape from disease, but genetic diversity in host populations may reduce the risk of infection.",

Agricultural fields represent environments in which plants are selected for high yield, and may therefore exhibit less genetic polymorphism than those in the wild. It is well known that disease epidemics have devastated agricultural monocultures (for example, rice blast, Zhu et al., 2000), and that monocultures are typically more susceptible to outbreaks than diverse mixtures of crops (Mundt, 2002). This association between low diversity and high disease incidence is called the \u2018monoculture effect' (for example, Elton, 1958; Leonard, 1969; Garrett and Mundt, 1999; Zhu et al., 2000; Pilet et al., 2006). Here, we examine how genetic diversity affects the spread of disease in natural populations. We also consider the theoretical basis for the monoculture effect in host populations, and suggest that there may be a \u2018diversity threshold' for disease spread.",

Newly-colonised, western populations of Italian agile frogs (Rana latastei) are genetically depauperate, and they have an increased susceptibility to a novel, emerging Ranavirus (Pearman and Garner, 2005). Similarly, dam construction in the Senegal river basin likely permitted the rapid expansion of snails (Biomphalaria pfeifferi ), which serve as the first-intermediate host for the human disease schistosomiasis (Campbell et al., 2010). Recently established Biomphalaria snail populations are genetically homogenous compared with those in natural habitats in Zimbabwe; they are also more susceptible to infection and this increases the opportunity for parasite transmission to humans (Campbell et al., 2010).",

In wild populations, Acevedo-Whitehouse et al. (2003) found that heavily inbred California sea lions were more infected, and consequently, may act as pathogen reservoirs, spreading parasites in sea lion populations. But, is increased susceptibility directly due to reduced diversity, or does inbreeding depression have an effect by compromising host condition? By manipulating the levels of inbreeding in Drosophila melanogaster, in laboratory experiments Spielman et al. (2004) confirmed that the increase in disease susceptibility resulted from a lower frequency of resistance alleles in the population, and not by generalized inbreeding effects. Inbreeding effects were similarly excluded as a reason for why offspring from inbred populations of Daphnia, a freshwater crustacean, were more susceptible to a vertically-transmitted parasite than those from outbred populations (Ebert et al., 2007). Finally, Kerstes and Wagner (2012) found that inbreeding increased parasite-induced mortality in the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) by prolonging development time, but it did not increase susceptibility to infection.",

For example, in eusocial insect colonies, queens can mate with a single male or with multiple males (polyandry), which determines the level of relatedness among individuals within a colony. High relatedness among individuals in a population can enhance the evolution of cooperation (Hamilton, 1964a, 1964b, 1987), but the genetic similarity between individuals may also facilitate the spread of parasites (Shykoff and Schmid-Hempel, 1991; Schmid-Hempel, 1998). As such, multiple mating has been suggested as an evolutionary response to parasite pressure (Hamilton, 1987; Sherman et al., 1988), which may counteract the high risk of parasite transmission and increase the overall productivity of the colony (Schmid-Hempel, 1994; Schmid-Hempel and Crozier, 1999; Brown and Schmid-Hempel, 2003).",

Ultimately, the balance between the costs (for example, within-colony conflict, reduced offspring output) and benefits (for example, resistance to a range of parasites) associated with heterogeneity in colonies may determine the optimal level of polyandry (Baer and Schmid-Hempel, 2001; Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006). Polygyny (the presence of multiple queens within a single colony) can also decrease the relatedness among individuals and increase the variety of resistance alleles in the colony. Studies in which the number of founding queens was experimentally manipulated have confirmed that colonies founded by multiple queens have lower parasite loads (Liersch and Schmid-Hempel, 1998; Reber et al., 2008). In addition, workers from polygynous colonies of an ant (Cardiocondyla obscurior) were better at detecting disease and removing infected individuals from the nest than workers from nests having a single queen (Ugelvig et al., 2010).",

Recently, two insightful empirical studies have quantified the effect of genetic diversity on resistance in host populations. Altermatt and Ebert (2008) and Ganz and Ebert (2010) conducted semi-natural mesocosm and lab experiments, respectively, whereby monoclonal and polyclonal Daphnia populations were exposed to microparasites. Parasites spread significantly faster (Altermatt and Ebert, 2008) and infection rates are higher (Ganz and Ebert, 2010) in host monocultures compared with \u2018polycultures' of several genotypes with higher allelic diversity. These studies suggest that the relationship between host diversity and infection may not be complex, and that a \u2018handful' of host genotypes in the population can be enough to hamper parasite transmission.",

Alternatively, in a diverse parasite population, there is a high probability that one of a diverse set of parasite genotypes can infect a homogeneous host population (Van Baalen and Beekman, 2006) and genetically diverse host populations are at an advantage.

Two models suggest that genetic variation in host susceptibility would not affect infectious disease spread (Springbett et al., 2003; Yates et al., 2006), but it might reduce the severity of infection (Springbett et al., 2003). In these models, hosts varied in susceptibility to a single pathogen strain, but no host genotype was completely resistant to infection. In contrast, Lively (2010a) found that host genetic diversity could reduce the risk of disease spread, assuming that each host genotype was susceptible to a different parasite genotype. This assumption is consistent with the \u2018matching-alleles' model for infection (Frank, 1993; Otto and Michalakis, 1998). The matching-alleles model is a useful framework for studying self/non-self-recognition systems in animals, and it is supported by studies on invertebrate immunity (Grosberg and Hart, 2000; Carius et al., 2001; Dybdahl et al., 2008; Duneau et al., 2011; Luijckx et al., 2011). In addition, the framework seems robust to the assumption of single-genotype specificity (Agrawal and Lively, 2002; Engelstaedter and Bonhoeffer, 2009).",

            "text": "The more recent model suggests that increases in the genetic diversity of host populations could have a large effect on disease spread and prevalence at equilibrium (Lively, 2010a). The model assumes that there are no co-infections, and that each parasite genotype can only infect one genetically determined resistance phenotype in the host population, which is the standard assumption of the matching-alleles model for infection. The results suggest that R0 for each parasite genotype i depends on total host density, as well as the frequency of the matching host genotype, where matches between host and parasite genotypes yield an infection. Thus, disease transmission is both density and frequency dependent. The effect of host density on R0 is asymptotic on Bgi, where gi is the frequency of the matching host genotype, and B is the number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host (Lively, 2010a). Thus, B is equal to the total number of propagules produced by an infection multiplied by the frequency of propagules that contact a host. For large host populations (N>200) the effect of further increasing the host population size has little effect; but, increasing the number of host genotypes has a large effect, because increasing the number of host genotypes decreases the frequency (gi) of each genotype. Under parasite-mediated, frequency-dependent selection, the frequency of each host genotype would be expected on average to be approximately 1/G, where G is the total number of host genotypes in the population. Under these conditions, R0 for large populations is approximately B/G. This result suggests that experimentally doubling the number of host genotypes in the population would reduce R0 by one half, and that this would be roughly true even if the experiment increased the total number of hosts in the population (assuming the population is already large). The analytical results also suggest that the parasite would die out, following the addition of genetic diversity to the host population, provided that the frequency of each host genotype declines to less than 1/B.",

At generation 1, one host of each genotype was introduced as infected. Thereafter, the infected hosts of each genotype were introduced into the population with a probability of 0.02 per generation, to simulate immigration of infected individuals. We started by assuming B=9, meaning each infection produced nine propagules that contacted a host. From the analytical results we would expect under that the average value for R0 would be B/G=9/6=1.5 (where G is the number of genotypes). As such, the pathogen would be expected to spread in the population, as was indeed the case (Figure 1a). After an initial oscillatory period, the gene frequency dynamics stabilized (Figure 1a), and the prevalence of infection also stabilized for the parameter values considered here (Figure 1b).

Average R0 quickly dropped to below 1 as the allele spread in the population (Figure 1c), and the frequency of infection declined sharply (Figure 1b). Matching parasite genotypes were introduced into the population by migration (at a rate of 0.02 per genotype per generation), which lead to selection against the new allele after it became common, as well as to a slight increase in R0 (Figure 1c). This resulted in sufficient selection to equalize allele frequencies so that the frequency of each genotype approximated 1/G.

A reduction in prevalence occurred despite the fact that matching parasite genotypes were also introduced into the population, and that the host population size remained large (that is, close to 40 000 individuals; results not shown). Clearly, under the assumptions of the present model, small increases in allelic diversity can cause dramatic reductions in parasitism, even in very large host populations. In addition, elimination of the pathogen is not necessarily followed by a loss of genetic diversity in the host population, as the different host genotypes are selectively neutral in the absence of parasite pressure (Figure 1a).",

However, a practical question arises: would the beneficial effect of adding hosts with novel genotypes, in order to increase local genetic diversity, outweigh the positive effect of increasing population size on R0? A possible answer is also suggested by the model, which suggests that the effect of increasing population size on R0 shows diminishing returns with host density, such that R0 is asymptotic on B/G (Figure 2). As such, while increasing host population size does strongly affect R0 in small host populations, it has a small effect in large host populations (Figure 2). This suggests that increasing genetic diversity can still reduce parasite prevalence, even though host population size is also increased. The results in Figure 2 suggest that boosting genetic diversity could overcome the effect of increasing host population size, even when the latter is increased by fourfold.",

Now suppose that we experimentally double the host population size, without affecting the genetic diversity (Point B). We see an increase in R0, but the increase is not large. Now suppose we double the host population size, but also increase the number of genotypes from 10 to 20 (Point C). We now see a large decrease in R0, but it does not go below 1, so the disease can still spread. Finally, suppose that we experimentally double the host population size, but we also increase the number of genotypes by fourfold (Point D). Now R0 not only deceases, but it goes below 1, so the disease will die out. Redrawn from Lively (2010a).",
