It has been calculated that only one peptide binds to an MHC class I molecule from 104 degraded proteins [2]. This explains the relatively subtle efficiency of antigen presentation by class I molecules. Coupled with this, cervical cancer cells (as well as a number of other malignant tumours) often show down regulation or, in a subset of cases, complete loss of MHC class I expression, most likely as a mechanism of immune escape [3].",

In this way all antigen molecules would be available for degradation into the ER and a larger number of peptides might be generated to be loaded onto MHC-I. With this strategy, peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and antigen-antitumour activity against a murine model of cervical uterine cancer were enhanced by fusion of the human papilloma virus (HPV-16) antigen E7 to CRT [4, 5]; however, the mechanism involved remains poorly understood. More significantly, the CRT has been shown to generate the greatest immune response compared to other adjuvant fusions, such as the sorting signal of the lysosome-associated membrane protein, Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) and the translocation domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. To simplify this strategy and to determine if most of the antitumour properties conferred by calreticulin are dependent on its ability to be retained in the ER, we engineered a new version of an E7 gene bearing the signals required for ER targeting, signal peptide (SP: MLLPVPLLLGLLGLAAAL) and ER retention (KDEL).",

After adenovirus production, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were infected with the different adenoviruses (SP-E7-KDEL, CRT-E7 or LacZ), and the protein extracts were analysed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, the SP-E7-KDEL adenovirus expresses an 18 kD protein, as expected, in contrast to the 70 kD band expressed by the CRT-E7 adenovirus. To demonstrate that the SP-E7-KDEL fusion protein has been distributed to the ER, we did immunofluorescent staining of cells infected with the different adenoviruses using antibodies against E7 protein and calnexin (a well-characterized marker for the ER) [7]. Previous studies in our laboratory and by others have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of E7 is lost by fusion to calreticulin which sequesters E7 to the ER [4\u20136]. As shown here again in Fig. 2, E7 (red signal) colocalization with the calnexin protein (green signal) confirms the distribution of the CRT-E7 to the ER. Similarly, E7 bearing the SP and the ER retention sequence from CRT (SP-E7-KDEL) had the same pattern as the calnexin marker, demonstrating that the signal sequences added to E7 from CRT are able to replace its function of ER retention.",

We previously had shown that fusion of CRT to E7 increases, about five times, the release of IFN-\u03b3 from splenocytes of mice immunized with an Adenovirus expressing this fusion (50 pg/ml) versus an Adenovirus expressing just E7 (10 pg/ml), and increases this eight times versus and Adenovirus expressing LacZ (6 pg/ml) [6]. As shown in Fig. 3, we confirmed again that splenocytes from mice immunized with Ad-CRT-E7 generated significant levels of IFN-\u03b3 when stimulated in vitro by the E7 epitope. The IFN-\u03b3 response upon immunization with the adenovirus expressing the SP-E7-KDEL showed also a significant induction of IFN-\u03b3 as the Ad-CRT-E7 did (eight times over the control Ad-LacZ).",

As seen in Fig. 4, rapid tumour growth was observed in the group of mice immunized with the control adenovirus expressing LacZ, all of whom had to be killed. As expected, immunization with an Adenovirus expressing E7 did no protect the mice against tumour development, which is because of its poor immunogenicity [4\u20136]. All the mice had to be killed as well. In contrast, all the mice vaccinated with the adenovirus expressing SP-E7-KDEL or CRT-E7 eliminated the tumour.

            "text": "Taken together, our results indicate that the adjuvant antitumour effect attributed to CRT [8\u201312] is mainly conferred by its SP and KDEL sequences, which allow antigens to enter and be maintained in the ER. The KDEL sequence is emerging as a significant antitumour immunity sequence. Recently, it was shown that dendritic cells loaded with exogenous peptides bearing the KDEL motif showed a more efficient antitumour activity than dendritic cells pulsed with peptides without KDEL [13]. Even though the mechanism of epitope generation in the ER is poorly understood, the KDEL sequence might result in a longer trafficking time through the ER, increasing the possibility of degradation and consequently, peptide generation and loading by the MHC-1 molecule. It will be worth determining the contribution of the SP itself to the adjuvant effect compared to the addition of both SP and KDEL sequences [14, 15]. Another advantage of this strategy is to prevent any putative adverse effect caused by overexpression of CRT, because of, for example its role in Ca2+ storage and transport into the ER [16]. It has been demonstrated that fusion of CRT also enhances the humoral response of antigens such as the receptor-binding domain (domain IV) of the protective antigen (PA[dIV]) of Bacillus anthracis[17] and a SARS coronavirus antigen [18]. Even though the pathway is unknown, it is expected that our strategy might potentiate this response as well. In conclusion targeting of antigens to the ER confers a striking immunogenic potential in gene cancer therapy. This work represents an important contribution for basic research and future clinical translation.",
