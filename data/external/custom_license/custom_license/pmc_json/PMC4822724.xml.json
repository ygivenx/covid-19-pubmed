Environmental stress, compromised host immunity, and virus infection predispose the animal to bacterial lung infection (broncho-pneumonia).1 Primary virus infections damage the respiratory tract and subdue the host immune system. The respiratory tract commensal bacteria cause opportunistic secondary infections and lung pneumonia under immunecompromised conditions (caused by viral infection and other factors). In fact, previous studies have reported bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza 3 virus, adenovirus, and bovine coronavirus from cattle with BRD.2\u20136 Although more than 40 years ago, studies concluded that bovine rhinitis viruses (BRVs) (then known as bovine rhinoviruses) cause mild respiratory disease in cattle,7\u201310 it is a surprise that BRVs are sparsely studied. This is partly due to the fact that the virus grows poorly in cell culture and is known to cause only self-limiting mild respiratory illness.",

For example, recently, Ng et al.7, using metagenomic approach, detected bovine influenza virus, bovine adeno-associated virus, bovine parvovirus, picobirnavirus, and multiple strains of BRAV and BRBV along with earlier reported viruses from BRD cattle samples. In another independent study, Hause et al.8 showed that BRAV and BRBV commonly circulate in BRD cattle. These findings raise a concern that similar to other BRD-associated viruses, primary infection with BRVs could facilitate bacterial infection. Alternatively, BRVs may themselves cause BRD in some cases.",

The reason for the strict laboratory guidelines for handling FMDV stems from the fact that it is the etiological agent of an economically devastating disease and is one of the most infectious animal viruses known. Like BRV and other Aphthoviruses, of which FMDV is the prototypic member, FMDV is a +ssRNA virus with a large open reading frame (ORF) flanked by two highly structured 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). As with other Aphthoviruses, the FMDV ORF encodes a polyprotein that is subsequently proteolytically cleaved into a series of intermediate and mature proteins, and often this ORF is subdivided into three regions namely P1, P2, and P3. Just upstream of the P1 region exists the coding sequence for the Lpro, which is preceded by two different AUG start codons that results in two different isoforms of the enzyme (Lab and Lb). The P1 region encodes four structural proteins: VP4 (1A), VP2 (1B), VP3 (1C), and VP1 (1D), while P2 and P3 encode nine nonstructural proteins: 2Apro, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B1, 3B2, 3B3, 3C protease (3Cpro), and 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol).",

In an effort to produce a useful vaccine platform, \u201cleader less\u201d FMDV constructs were characterized, showing considerable attenuation relative to parental virus. In a separate study, the Lpro of FMDV was functionally exchanged with BRBV Lpro to develop an FMDV\u2013BRBV chimera vaccine.16 This vaccine showed promise in controlling FMDV infection under controlled experimental conditions. However, we speculated that the observed similarity between FMDV and BRV has another face to reckon with. Organisms containing similar (homologous) sequences may undergo recombination. In fact, multiple in-depth examinations of publicly available Picornavirus sequences have revealed evidence of significant recombination events among the +ssRNA genomes of Picornaviridae members.17\u201321",

The PCR reaction conditions used were according to the manufacturer's recommendations for amplification products between 5 kilobase (kb) pairs and 9 kb pairs. The 5\u2032 end of the genome between the putative poly(C) and VP3 coding regions was isolated by using a commercially available rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (SMART\u2122 RACE; Clontech Laboratories Inc.). A 3\u2032 anchored cDNA was synthesized using the complimentary gene specific primer (VP3-R1: 5\u2032 TTGGGCCTCACTCAGAGTGGTGGGGGGAT-3\u2032) and by following the manufacturer's protocol. By using the Advantage\u00ae 2-PCR enzyme system, 5\u2032 RACE reactions were carried out using anchor (universal primer mix) and gene-specific primers (VP3-R2: 5\u2032-TGGGTCCGCGGTGATGGGACTAGTGGTGC-3\u2032) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for amplification of products ranging from 1 kb to 5 kb. PCR products were purified using a PCR-purification kit (Qiagen NV), and the integrity of amplicons was confirmed on a 1% agarose gel. Sequences corresponding to the ends of the purified amplicons were obtained by direct sequencing with specific primers designed from previously determined partial BRAV (SD-1) sequence. Subsequent sequence data were determined by using a \u201cprimer walking\u201d strategy in which primers for sequencing were designed based on ongoing sequence determination. All sequencing reactions were carried out using the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed on a PRISM 3730xl automated DNA sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",

The results shown in Table 1 show that the SLAC method did not detect any codon site subject to positive selection between these viruses. However, the FEL method detected codon sites 489 and 832 in the structural protein P1 region and codon site 1958 in the 3Dpol region under positive selection pressure. The IFEL method that computes site-wise selection only on the internal branches of the phylogeny tree detected 14 sites subject to positive evolutionary selection, with ten sites in the 3Dpol region and four in the structural protein P1 region. Together, these data suggest that the 3Dpol region has the higher prevalence of evolutionary selection. SLAC and FEL methods detected 363 and 425 sites under negative evolutionary pressure, whereas IFEL unexpectedly found only 3 sites under negative selection. It appears that the selection pressure detected by IFEL, by virtue of working on the internal branches of the phylogeny tree, detects mostly the selection events within species and hence BRAV RS3X and BRBV, being more closely related, would yield such unexpected results.",

In fact, recombination is considered to contribute significantly to RNA virus evolution. When analyzing a group of nucleotide sequences for the probability of recombination events, the most common first step is to search for so-called \u201crecombination breakpoints\u201d in the existing sequences. Multiple algorithms have been designed to dissect an alignment of several nucleotide sequences for local regions that exhibit the hallmarks of a recombination breakpoint. The RDP software package uses multiple algorithms, such as RDP, GENECONV, CHIMAERA, MAXCHI, BOOTSCAN, PHYLPRO, LARD, SISCAN, and 3SEQ. In its default mode, RDP calculates even the least possible event. However, a recombination event should only be considered significant if it is evidenced by multiple methods. In this study, we considered an event to be significant only when evidence was provided by four or more methods. In this way, we could take into account the results produced by four out of nine methods employed. Such a strategy has been applied to interpret the recombination events detected using RDP.58\nTable 3 shows the results from an analysis of BRAV RS3X and three other viruses: FMDV A24 Cruzeiro, BRBV, and ERAV. Due to several breaks produced in the ORF due to inclusion of both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR, these regions were excluded from the alignment and only single ORFs from the Lpro to 3Dpol regions of these viruses were aligned and included for recombination detection. RDP that recognizes even the remotest possible event, recognized six potential recombination hot spots in the ORF of these viruses, and BRAV RS3X was involved in five of them. However, none of these were confirmed by more than four methods set up as cut-off, and hence we concluded that the possibility of inter-species recombination between different Aphthoviruses analyzed herein is negligible.",

Major differences between the prototypic Aphthovirus FMDV and BRAV RS3X were observed in the architecture of capsid and non-structural proteins 2B and 3A. Only the capsid protein VP1 of FMDV displays a cellular integrin-binding arginine-glycine-aspertate (RGD) tri-peptide motif in its G\u2013H loop.46\u201348 The remaining three Aphthoviruses (BRAV, BRBV, and ERAV) lack this essential cellular receptor-binding site as revealed by structural modeling and analysis of sequence alignment, suggesting a different mechanism of cell attachment for these viruses. In fact, the ERAV crystal structure revealed that it binds the cell surface via sialic acid.59 The 2B viroporin of BRAV RS3X is significantly smaller than FMDV, and lack of a C-terminal trans-membrane helix of the former indicates a diversion in its topology or function from FMDV. Surprisingly, the modeled structure of the 2B protein from FMDV and BRBV suggest that the latter preserves the membrane pore-lining histidine residue, whereas FMDV 2B lacks this characteristic feature of a viroporin molecule.60 Conservation of active sites and other functionally critical residues in Lpro, 2Apro, 3Cpro, 3Dpol, and membrane anchorage residue in the 3A protein of BRAV RS3X when compared with Aphthoviruses (FMDV, BRBV, and ERAV) and within BRV species reinforces the functional retention of the molecular biology of Aphthoviruses in BRAV RS3X.",

The similarity in results obtained using both algorithmic sets strengthens the final conclusion that recombination events are unlikely between the FMDV and BRV genomes within the regions encoding the structural proteins. Based on examination of the recombination analysis data of Aphthoviruses and BRVs, we conclude that the inter-species recombination events involving FMDV, BRAV, BRBV, and ERAV do not seem likely.

The observed higher number of positive selection breakpoints among BRVs is not a surprise and reinforces their common ancestry. As expected, negligible evidence of single-point positive selection sites proves a parallel but distinct lineage of the different Aphthoviruses included in this study.",
