            "text": "In recent years, the new policy design orientation has been articulated as the road map for policy design scholars (Howlett 2014; Howlett and Lejano 2013; Howlett et al. 2015). At the same time, an approach has emerged that aims at explaining the phenomenon of disproportionate policy response, which is understood to be \u201ca lack of \u2018fit\u2019 or balance between the costs of a public policy and the benefits that are derived from this policy, and/or between a policy\u2019s ends and means\u201d (Maor 2016a, 3; see also b). The foundational patterns of disproportionate policy response include policy over- and underreaction (Maor 2012, 2014a). Sustained patterns of these policy responses are termed policy bubbles (Jones et al. 2014; Maor 2014b, 2015, 2016c). Not only has disproportionate policy response been a focal point for policymakers seeking radical policy change\u2014which is tantamount to Hall\u2019s (1993) third-order paradigmatic policy change\u2014or no change at all (McConnell and \u2019t Hart 2014) under conditions of uncertain risk projections, but such action has time and time again also made a dramatic impact upon the direction and the character of policy and politics (e.g., the U.S. response to 9/11). However, little attention has so far been devoted to the implications of the emerging area of disproportionate policy response for the new policy design studies. The reason may have been that disproportionate policy response is an anomaly which, in addition to its rarity, poses methodological challenges because it is both context-sensitive and has a problematic counterfactual, that is, proportionate policy response. To bridge this gap, this paper articulates the disproportionate policy perspective and uses it to mount four challenges for the new policy design orientation.",

These arguments challenge the prevalent views that disproportionate policy responses are solely the result of unintentional actions (Walker and Malici 2011), disproportionate information processing (Jones and Baumgartner 2005), policymakers\u2019 overconfidence (Maor 2012), misestimation of risk (Maor 2014a), or flawed decision-making processes such as Groupthink (Janis 1982) and Polythink (Mintz and Wayne 2016).",

Whereas the Federal Reserve response to the crisis of 2007\u20132008 provides an example of the former, a no-regrets carbon reduction policy (or any other policy in the area of climate change mitigation that is worth undertaking on economic grounds whether or not there are climate-related reasons for doing so) provides an example of the latter.",

It thus argues that the emotional arena of policy may be equally, if not more, important than the substantive one.

            "text": "\nDisproportionate policy design refers to the articulation of policy over- or underreaction goals as well as to the means or mechanisms through which such goals are given effect. It largely takes place at the formulation stage of the policy cycle and deals with plans for the implementation stage\u2014how forcefully or weakly policy instruments are implemented, and with the communication of these plans to target populations. Disproportionate policy response can take one of two forms: policy overreaction or policy underreaction. Policy overreactions \u201care policies that impose objective and/or perceived social costs without producing offsetting objective and/or perceived benefits\u201d (Maor 2012, 235). These costs and benefits may be incurred by policymakers, target populations and/or the general public, depending on the perspective taken by the researcher. One manifestation of policy overreaction is the concept of policy overinvestment, which occurs \u201cwhen government overinvests in a single policy instrument beyond its instrumental value in achieving a policy goal [\u2026]\u201d (Jones et al. 2014, 149). A similar distinction applies in the case of policy underreaction, which refers to \u201csystematically slow and/or insufficient response by policymakers to increased risk or opportunity, or no response at all\u201d (Maor 2014a, 426). This implies that it is \u201ca policy whose actual net utility [\u2026] is smaller than a counterfactual net utility [\u2026]\u201d (Maor 2014a, 428). Adapted from Jones et al. (2014), policy underinvestment occurs when policymakers underinvest in a single policy instrument below its instrumental value in achieving a policy goal. Whereas the definitions of policy over- and underreaction appeal to considerations of public interest broadly defined, including economic efficiency, social welfare, social justice, sustainability and individual well-being, the definitions of policy over- and underinvestment, although easily measurable and tractable, often appeal to narrow considerations of economic efficiency.",

Let me define key policy options in this repertoire. Policy overreaction doctrine refers to \u201ca coherent set of policy principles which presents an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 policy commitment in pursuit of a policy goal no matter what the costs are\u201d (Maor 2016a, 10). Policy overreaction rhetoric, a subset of policy overreaction doctrine, refers to \u201carguments that policymakers employ to reach and persuade the target populations of their \u2018all or nothing\u2019 policy commitment to achieve their policy goal, no matter what the costs are\u201d (Maor 2016a, 11). Policy underreaction doctrine refers to \u201ca coherent set of policy principles which presents a conditional commitment for achieving a policy goal based primarily on policy costs considerations\u201d (Maor 2016a, 12). Policy underreaction rhetoric, a subset of policy underreaction doctrine, refers to \u201carguments employed by policymakers to reach and persuade the target populations of the former\u2019s conditional commitment to respond to a policy problem based primarily on policy costs considerations\u201d (Maor 2016a, 12). These concepts\u2014which are supported by pertinent examples\u2014allow scholars to address upfront the idea that, at times, disproportionate policy options are deliberately designed. This insight, in turn, provides a convenient starting point for the articulation of a disproportionate policy perspective which brings to the fore the core elements of the phenomenon of disproportionate policy response.",

Regarding the design of disproportionate policy options, policymakers wishing to decisively and swiftly end a crisis, especially one that involves panic and popular fears, may use policy overreaction rhetoric and doctrines in order to communicate to target populations or to implement an all-or-nothing policy approach aimed at resolving the policy problem no matter what (Maor 2016a; forthcoming). In addition, policymakers wishing to respond to uncertain risk projections in order to create net social benefits under all future risk projections, with no or low costs and committed resources, and in a way which can be framed as cost-effective without involving hard trade-offs with other policy objectives, may use policy underreaction rhetoric and doctrines (Maor 2016a).

But at times, policymakers may wish to radically change the status quo in a matter of days or a few weeks and/or to bring about policy benefits lasting for years or perhaps decades, no matter what the costs are. Such policy changes may range from changes in the policy core aspects of the policy subsystem which are associated with changes in the policy core beliefs of a belief system\u2014read major policy change in the advocacy coalition framework (Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1993), to a complete paradigmatic transformation (Hall 1993). Radical policy change may be sought by policymakers at critical junctures or during windows of opportunity (Kingdon 1995), such as in times of crises requiring drastic measures, or when positive feedback reinforces political forces (Baumgartner and Jones 2002). It may derive from the emergence of a new paradigm (Hall 1993), ideas (Peters et al. 2005), and core beliefs (Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1993), as well as a new policy image (Baumgartner and Jones 2002), policy discourse (Hajer 1995), and policy frame (Sch\u00f6n and Rein 1994).",

The same outcome may be reasonably expected when policymakers respond in (what they perceive as) a proportionate manner, which may be wrongly perceived by the target populations as underreaction [especially if the target population overestimate the power of the initiators of the policy response]. By contrast, if policymakers aim at changing the status quo, policy overreaction at the core of the policy problem is likely to leave no room for interpretative error by the target populations regarding the intention of those who overreact.Policymakers may be aware of this calculation and, when confronting potential threats, may wisely act to design off-the-shelf options of disproportionate policy response before the need arises.

            "text": "To illustrate, consider how disproportionate policy thinking penetrates cabinet discussions regarding policy response in security matters. Israeli policymakers have sought to contain the Hezbollah threat since the unilateral withdrawal of Israel from Lebanon in May 2000. On July 12, 2006, Hezbollah terrorists attacked an Israeli patrol on the Israeli side of the border and abducted two soldiers. In the ensuing discussion that took place in the Israeli cabinet, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz preferred a forceful reaction. One alternative suggested by the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Chief of Staff Dan Halutz revolved around the use of disproportionate force directed at Hezbullah\u2019s host, Lebanon. According to Halutz,The response of a democratic state in the fight against terror must be a response of the sort of \u201cthe landlord [read, policymakers] gone mad\u201d. The [policy] recommendation that was crystallized was to opt for a large-scale act that would damage Lebanon\u2019s national infrastructures [\u2026] I thought, by the way, that that would trigger a rush of all the international community to this area in order to stop the Israeli who had \u201cgone mad\u201d. Certainly we would have attained a significantly better achievement (TV Interview by Raviv Drucker, Lebanon 2, Hamakor, 12.5.15).This option was later rejected in favor of another policy overreaction option: to flatten the Hezbollah stronghold, the southern residential suburb of Beirut known as the Dahiyah, that was home to Hezbollah leadership as well as to Shiite supporters of this terror organization. This strategy has proved highly successful in transforming the status quo. According to Amos Yadlin (2015), former IDF Head of Intelligence, \u201c[t]wo significant moves\u2014impairing Hezbollah\u2019s rocket launching ability and destroying its headquarters in Beirut\u2019s Dahiya[h] Quarter\u2014were essential components in the restoration and intensification of the Israeli deterrence in 2006\u201d.",

In this context, the flattening of the Dahiyah has been seen as a relevant model. The doctrine refers to a military strategy that focuses on using disproportionate air power and artillery to punitively destroy the entire area from which rockets are fired rather than hunting down individual missile launchers. Gadi Eisenkot, the then IDF Head of Northern Command, threatened Hamas and Hezbollah by stating that \u201c[w]hat happened in the Dahiya[h] quarter of Beirut in 2006 will happen in every village from which Israel is fired on [\u2026] We will apply disproportionate force on it (village) and cause great damage and destruction there. From our standpoint, these are not civilian villages; they are military bases\u201d (Eisenkot, quoted in Nahmias 2008). \u201cThis is not a recommendation. This is the plan and it has been approved\u201d (Eisenkot, quoted in Fishman and Ringel-Hoffman 2008). This position was confirmed by the then Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, who was quoted in the New York Times: \u201cThe government\u2019s position was from the outset that if there is shooting at the residents of the south, there will be a harsh Israeli response that will be disproportionate.\u201d1 This strategy was employed during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza (December 2008\u2013January 2009), which aimed at stopping both rocket fire into Israel and weapon smuggling into the Gaza Strip. The total number Palestinian noncombatants who died during the operation ranges from 295 (IDF figures, quoted in Lappin 2009) to 926, according to human rights NGOs.",

Take, for example, the transboundary threats posed by some of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens for which few or no medical countermeasures exist, and the impact these threats have both at the substantive and the emotional arena of policy. When contagious epidemics arise in various countries, there is an increasing possibility that infected travelers will spread the disease. The design of the primary mitigation strategy to reduce this risk revolves around exit/entry screening of all persons at international borders for unexplained symptoms of illness which may be associated with the disease. This policy design, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO 2003, 2014), focuses on those individuals at the highest risk, traveling to and from those countries at highest risk, and involves a combination of screening, quarantine, isolation and communications. However, when contagious epidemics arise, the derived public fears and panic may pose a problem which may be equally, if not more, important than the substantive one. The need faced by policymakers to reduce public fears and panic often leads them to adopt exit/entry screening although it is common (professional) knowledge that these measures are ineffective at detecting infectious persons and involve intensive use of resources and relatively high opportunity costs, financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources during a time of high need (Selvey et al. 2015, 197). For example, during the SARS outbreak of 2003, despite the institution of a combination of border measures in Australia, Canada, and Singapore, no confirmed SARS cases were detected (Selvey 2015, 199). During the influenza pandemic of 2009, of the influenza cases that might have been acquired during travel overseas, only 12.9 % (15/116) were detected in Singapore as a result of border screening, and in Japan 6.6 % (10/151), in New South Wales, Australia 6.7 % (3/45), and in Auckland, New Zealand 5.8 % (4/69) (Selvey et al. 2015, 198). And during the Ebola crisis of 2014, entry screening programs at five US international airports detected no confirmed cases (Brown et al. 2014). Although border screening provides a classic example of policy overreaction, it has been implemented time and time again as an off-the-shelf mitigation strategy.",

Economic efficiency refers to the optimal allocation of resources while minimizing waste, and effectiveness, to the achievement of the goal a policy is supposed to attain. Governments are therefore assumed to apply knowledge and experience about policy issues in such a way as to ensure that their goals are effectively achieved with a minimum of effort and cost (Weimer 1993) or, more or less, in an efficient and effective way (deLeon 1999; Potoski 2002). This approach primarily emphasizes normative concerns which emerge during routine policy design. However, according to the disproportionate policy perspective, there are certain conditions under which policymakers may tend to develop effective response no matter what the costs are, or cost-conscious response, with effectiveness considerations becoming only secondary in importance if at all. Specifically, although policymakers should ideally pursue cost-conscious behavior that results in the highest net benefit for the public, at times, they may prioritize the immediacy of the policy outcome (i.e., use of the overwhelming power of the state with the expectation that the policy problem will be resolved or significantly minimized in a matter of days or a few weeks, rather than months and years) or the durability of policy outcomes (i.e., with the expectation that the policy benefits will last for years or perhaps decades due, for example, to deterrent effects) over other considerations, such as the policy costs. At other times, they may prioritize the creation of net social benefits under all future risk projections, with no or low costs and committed resources, over other considerations, such as the optimal performance of the policy in any risk scenario. In other words, what the disproportionate policy perspective adds to the discussion of policy underreaction is the view of this type of policy as a preference, rather than as an unintentional error, derived from disproportionate information processing, policymakers\u2019 overconfidence, misestimation of risk, or flawed decision-making processes.",

In the financial crisis, 12 out of 13 of the most important financial institutions in the USA were at risk of failure within a period of a week or two (Ben Bernanke, quoted in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission 2011, 354). Perhaps more important was the resulting panic due to concerns about the solvency of the US financial institutions (Ben Bernanke, quoted in the Federal Open Market Committee Minutes 2008, 149). Bernanke\u2019s response was to follow a policy overreaction doctrine, namely, Bagehot\u2019s (1873) rule that, in a crisis, the central bank should lend freely, at a high rate, and on good collateral (Benrnanke 2014a, b). A press release issued on August 10, 2007, by the Federal Reserve stated that it would provide reserves as necessary due to the \u201cunusual funding needs because of dislocations in money and credit markets.\u201d2 The source of the funding necessary to follow Bagehot\u2019s rule originated within a month of Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy, when Congress passed the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In the framework of TARP, $700 billion were allocated by Congress to address the banking crisis; the bill passed on October 3, 2008. However, only $125 billion were actually injected as a first step into the nine largest financial institutions in the US banking system (Gorton 2015). Once the banking sector and the economy had stabilized, calibration of the disproportionate policy response took place. Although Congress initially authorized $700 billion for TARP, that authority was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).",

Although there is scientific evidence pointing at a change in the world\u2019s climate as a result of human activity, the precise impacts on the UK are still uncertain. Therefore, the emphasis of adaptation to climate change has been on increasing the nation\u2019s resilience to a range of possible futures by adopting the no/low regret doctrine. Indeed, if one looks at the justification of \u201c[\u2026] activities which have taken place as a direct result of climate change or weather related incidences [\u2026],\u201d one can find that \u201c[m]ost current adaptations are justified on co-benefits and/or are \u2018no regret\u2019 options\u201d (U.K. Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs 2005, 8). According to a recent report, however, climate change adaptation measures pursued so far have failed to deliver when projected climate change predictions regarding winter floods had materialized (Committee on Climate Change 2014).3 Specifically, although the 2013 floods were \u201cconsistent with the projected consequences of climate change\u201d (Committee on Climate Change 2014, 8), these \u201c[e]vents [\u2026] illustrate the costs of a lack of resilience, with many thousands of people forced to leave their homes, businesses and transport disrupted, with the associated costs to the economy and to well-being\u201d (Krebs, in Committee on Climate Change 2014, 4).

This assumption ignores the possibility that policymakers may design disproportionate policy options to be used as signaling devices (Spence 1973), that is, as means of deterrence or insurance for a rainy day. A policy overreaction doctrine, for example, acts first and foremost, as a signaling device. It is designed, among other reasons, in order to reduce information asymmetry between policymakers and target populations. During the process by which policy content is produced, termed policy designing (e.g., Linder and Peters 1988), policymakers signal their unobservable mindset to target audiences via the observable quality of their doctrines as well as via other elements, such as the identity of the ministry or department in charge of policy implementation, the ethical constraints imposed on those in charge of policy implementation, or their lack thereof, and others (Maor forthcoming). A policy overreaction doctrine is successful, among others, if it produces the desired effect without the need for its implementation on the ground (Maor 2016a; forthcoming).",

Current wisdom disputes this view. At the outset, scholars have examined several variables that influence public responses to risks. The \u201crisk as analysis\u201d paradigm, for example, focuses on the use of cognitive deliberation to assess risk while pointing at heuristics and biases used to process and understand risk information (e.g., Slovic 1987; Stedman 2004). The \u201crisk as feelings\u201d paradigm argues that people often rely more on affect and emotion than cognition when making risk judgments and decisions (Loewenstein et al. 2001; Finucane 2008).4 This paradigm identifies an \u201caffect heuristic\u201d which is strongly associated with risk perceptions and policy support for a range of risk issues, including global warming (Smith and Leiserowitz 2012; Siegrist et al. 2006). And recently, Lodge and Taber (2013) found that \u201c[\u2026] all thinking is suffused with feeling, and these feeling arise automatically within a few milliseconds [\u2026] of exposure to a sociopolitical object or event\u201d (p. 19). The affect heuristic combined with Lodge and Taber\u2019s (2013) finding undermine the aforementioned distinction made by the new policy design orientation.",

These policies are built around the idea that restricting the hours when targeted age groups may be in public should restrict their crime opportunities (McDowall 2000; Ford 1994). A 1994 survey of US cities with populations of 200,000 or greater found that 77 % (59/77) had implemented juvenile policy (Ruefle and Reynolds 1995), and in 1995, 73 % (146/200) of the 200 largest American cities (Ruefle and Reynolds 1996) had enacted such policies. Reports of six evaluations of juvenile curfew policies conducted between 1977 and 2000 found no preventive effect, with some studies indicating a modest crime prevention benefit (McDowall 2000). Adams\u2019s (2003) review of ten studies evaluating these policies found no decrease in crime rates as a result of curfews, and where changes were observed, they revolve around an increase in crime rather than a decrease. And Mears et al. (2010) have cited a report concluding that \u201cresearch clearly indicates that juvenile curfew laws are ineffective.\u201d However, the lack of any clear evidence of the effectiveness of juvenile curfews for crime prevention misses their effectiveness in the local emotional arena. The speed by which local laws or ordinances can be enacted combined with the public visibility of their implementation provide a politically effective, off-the-shelf solution to calm public fears. Curfews can be justified on grounds of their ability to protect children and residents as well to flag at-risk or neglected youths and connect them with the appropriate services, such as counseling, mentoring, and tutoring. There is therefore ample political capital to be gained by promoting such laws.",

An important part of the significant research agenda that remains to be explored in the new policy design orientation should revolve around the actual activities of designing disproportionate policy options. How do policymakers and policy designers go about identifying design problems that call for disproportionate policy responses? How do they design criteria addressing these problems? How do they decide on the mix of disproportionate policy rhetoric or doctrine? How do they select policy tools that, if backfiring when aggressively employed, can be easily calibrated? How does the nature of the policy means selected for deployment in a disproportionate policy response affect policymakers\u2019 degrees of freedom? What are the politics involved in the calibration of policy goals and policy means? Answering these questions will enable scholars to analyze short- and long-term cause-and-effect processes involving the design of disproportionate policy options while taking into account more symbolic, ideational and emotional trends affecting the legitimacy or appropriateness of certain courses of action; their conjunctions with each other as well as with the knowledge and experience regarding alternative possible arrangements of policy tools, and their sequencing, which could add additional explanatory power to the study of policy design and disproportionate policy response.",

Global and domestic threats coupled with relatively skeptical publics about politicians and political institutions, and rising negativity in democratic politics (Soroka 2014) imply that policy overshooting is increasingly required for the public to perceive of policy action as sufficient and politicians as competent, at least in the short term. Future new policy design studies would therefore benefit from expanding the conceptual and empirical universe they examine to also include the design of disproportionate policy options. Further, the new policy design orientation would benefit by greater boundary crossing among social science disciplines, especially psychology. For example, the study of policy design and emotions offers new methodologies, concepts, and opportunities to refine explanations of the selection of policy goals and policy means. Overall, the disproportionate policy perspective can advance a more nuanced analysis of policy options at different levels of government. Combining the new policy design and the disproportionate policy perspective will establish new territory and may offer a promising path for progress.",
