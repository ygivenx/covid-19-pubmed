Recently, sensitive PCR assays have been introduced and are now considered to be the gold standard for the detection and differentiation of all feline haemoplasma species [33, 36, 37]. Using PCR, the worldwide distribution of feline haemotropic mycoplasma infections has been documented [7, 20, 29, 32, 34, 41]. To date, no commercial routine serologic assay is available, and serodiagnostics have depended on crude Mhf antigens [1, 5]. Recently, an immunodominant protein of Mycoplasma suis, a porcine haemoplasma species, was identified as HspA1, a surface-localised dnaK analogue [15\u201317].",

            "text": "The natural mode of feline haemoplasma transmission remains controversial. Experimental transmission by the intraperitoneal, intravenous, and oral inoculation of infected blood has been successful [4]. However, these early studies were performed prior to the introduction of specific molecular assays, so it is not known which feline haemoplasma species were studied. More recently, blood transfusions have been reported to be a source of Mhf and CMhm infections [8, 37]. Furthermore, blood-sucking arthropods may be involved in the transmission of feline haemoplasmas. While almost 2 000 unfed Ixodes spp. ticks collected from vegetation in Switzerland tested PCR-negative for feline haemoplasmas, and positive results for CMhm and CMt were only obtained from some Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected directly from animals [39], CMhm DNA has been detected in unfed Ixodes ovatus ticks in Japan [31]. This suggests a transstadial transmission of CMhm at least in the latter tick species. Moreover, Mhf and CMhm DNA was detected in cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) collected from experimentally and naturally infected cats and in flea faeces [18, 28, 39, 42, 43], but the transmission of Mhf and CMhm via C. felis has not been proven [42, 43]. Recently, an investigation of shedding patterns by real-time PCR led to the detection of CMt DNA in saliva and faeces up to nine weeks after experimental CMt infection [39]. In the same study, however, Mhf and CMhm DNA were not detected in the saliva and faeces of some naturally infected cats, despite high blood haemotropic mycoplasma loads [39] and most recently CMhm but not Mhf was detected in the saliva and salivary glands of experimentally infected cats [2]. We thus hypothesised that feline haemoplasmas, and particularly CMt or CMhm, could be transmitted by direct contact (social or aggressive) via saliva [39, 40]. Our hypothesis is supported by the general increase of feline haemoplasma infections, and particularly Mhf, CMhm and CMt infections, in male cats [21, 32, 37, 38]. Moreover, an early study reported that a history of cat bite-associated abscesses increased the relative risk of infection with haemotropic mycoplasmas [11]; however, the particular haemoplasma species could not be molecularly differentiated at the time of that study.",

They were kept in a confined university facility under hygienically ideal conditions. All experiments were officially approved by the veterinary office of the canton of Zurich (101/2007). The cats were kept in groups in large rooms furnished with running boards, climbing trees, ladders, hammocks, elevated sleeping places, and shielding retreat areas, under optimal ethological conditions. Prior to the start of the experiment, each cat was clinically examined, and blood and serum samples and conjunctival, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected to verify their SPF status. The cats were found to be negative when the samples were tested by real-time TaqMan PCR or RT-PCR, as described [12\u201314, 19, 22, 24, 30, 35\u201337], as follows. The blood samples were tested for CMt; Mhf; CMhm; feline parvovirus, calicivirus, and coronavirus; Bartonella henselae; and feline leukaemia and immunodeficiency virus provirus. The conjunctival swabs were tested for feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus-1, and for Chlamydophila felis. The oropharyngeal swabs were tested for feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus-1, and the rectal swabs were tested for feline coronavirus and feline parvovirus. In addition, the serum samples tested negative for antibodies to feline coronavirus [26]. Cats were blood-typed using a commercial gel column technique (ID-Gel Test Feline A+B Typing; DiaMed AG, Cressier sur Morat, Switzerland): 11 cats were of blood type A and two cats were of blood type B. The two latter cats were siblings. Three castrated adult male cats (2 and 3 years of age) were infected intraperitoneally with CMt to obtain infectious saliva and blood samples (amplificatory cats; Cats X, Y, and Z). Ten juvenile cats (two months of age) housed in two groups of 5 cats each (groups A and B) were used as recipient cats for the transmission studies. Following the conclusion of this study, the three amplificatory cats were adopted; the ten recipient cats continued to remain as study cats.",

All cats used in the CMt transmission study were seronegative prior to CMt exposure (Fig. 4B). After CMt challenge, all 13 cats became seropositive based on the western blot analysis (Fig. 4C). Weekly serum samples demonstrated seroconversion in the majority of these cats between 3 and 4 weeks p.i. (Figs. 1 and 2). Cats infected intraperitoneally with CMt demonstrated seroconversion between 3 and 6 weeks p.i. (Fig. 1) and remained seropositive until 13 to 15 weeks p.i. Thereafter, the bands observed in the western blot decreased in intensity and/or vanished over time. In group A, 4 out of the 5 cats seroconverted 3 to 4 weeks after exposure A V (Fig. 2A and 2C\u20132E), while one cat, Cat 2 (Fig. 2B), had already seroconverted 7 weeks after oronasal saliva inoculation (A II). Cat 2 was 1 of the 2 cats with blood type B. In group B, the four PCR-positive cats also seroconverted following CMt exposure (Tab. II, B III) between 3 and 5 weeks p.i. (Figs. 2F, 2H, 2I, and 2K). One cat, Cat 7 (Fig. 2G), remained PCR-negative throughout the study and subsequently seroconverted 8 weeks after a second subcutaneous inoculation of 1 \u00d7 103 CMt copies (Tab. II, B IV). All recipient cats remained seropositive until the end of the study.\n",

Nonetheless, one cat (Cat 2) seroconverted following the oral inoculation of CMt-positive saliva. Thus, in this cat, it appeared that at least CMt antigens must have been transmitted via saliva. Any resulting CMt replication must have been below the detection limit of the PCR assay or occurred in tissues other than the peripheral blood.

A somewhat different course of infection was observed in two cats, and, remarkably, these were siblings and the only two cats in the present study with blood type B. One cat, Cat 2, was already seropositive at the time of subcutaneous exposure because it had seroconverted after oronasal exposure to CMt-positive saliva (see above). Cat 2 only became PCR-positive later in the course of infection, following subcutaneous exposure (day 45 p.i.), and developed a lower peak CMt blood load (1.4 \u00d7 103 copies/mL) compared to the other eight cats (median peak load: 5.7 \u00d7 104 copies/mL). The second blood type B cat, Cat 7, remained blood PCR-negative, even after repeated CMt exposures. This cat subsequently seroconverted after the second CMt inoculation but was never blood PCR-positive. While the oronasal exposure to CMt antigens and the resulting immune response in Cat 2 might have led to partial protection and a reduced CMt load, the antibiotic treatment of Cat 7 three weeks before the first CMt blood inoculation may have influenced the course of infection. Alternatively, the blood type of the two cats, both blood type B, or other genetic factors may have played a role in their susceptibility to CMt. However, due to the small number of subjects in the present study, this cannot be determined. This course of CMt infection described herein, i.e., seroconversion in the absence of CMt in the peripheral blood, as detected by real-time PCR, has not been described previously.",
