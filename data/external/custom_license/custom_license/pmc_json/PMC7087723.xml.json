            "text": "The COMparative BINding Energy (COMBINE) method was introduced for the first time in 1995 by Ortiz et al. [1] to enable the study of congeneric series of compounds including the structural information of ligand\u2013protein complexes. By extracting the decomposed protein\u2013ligand interaction energies computed from structures of the complexes, the method allows to derive Quantitative Structure Active Relationships (QSAR) models using a regression algorithm (Partial Least Squares or PLS for instance). Since its introduction, several works have been published, for example [2\u20135], supporting the ability of the method to help understanding how compounds interact with their targets, explaining the different contributions to their potency, and to provide useful guidelines to design new molecules. Some of the latest examples include the study of type II dehydroquinase inhibitors by Peon et al. [6], the design of ligands against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) chymotrypsin-like protease [7] or the discovery of uncompetitive inhibitors of the glutamate racemase MurI from Helicobacter pylori [8]. However, although attempts have been made to keep the tool up with the times by incorporating new regression types [9] and implementing a comprehensive graphical user interface [10], the method has not received the same level of attention compared to other alternatives to study QSAR that provide better predictive ability and improved measurements of the uncertainty of the predictions [11\u201314]. These methods have, nonetheless, some challenges of their own. They may allow computational chemists to assess, up to a certain point, the reliability of their predictions, but do not offer any guidance about how to improve the performance of the models in the future if it is not satisfactory, which is often the case. On top of that, many times these algorithms work as some sort of black boxes [13] so that the interpretation of the results in a target-ligand context can be difficult. COMBINE analysis, on the other hand, provides a natural interpretation for potency contributions and allows exploiting such information to design new molecules all within the comfortable environment, for modellers and medicinal chemists, of the binding site.",

AL strategies, by using an estimation of uncertainty for the predictions and an iterative learning scheme, enable building robust models with a fraction of the data that would be required with traditional approaches for the same accuracy. Several AL variants exist [15], each one with different strengths and weaknesses, but they all share the need to query the source of information, that is, to evaluate certain compounds for the sake of improving future model performance. This conceptual shift, meaning that the model not only casts predictions but it is also allowed to request more information as needed, is behind the consistently better performance shown by these methods [16, 17].",

In the case of the HIV-PR model and after an initial optimization procedure based on a standard 80%/20% training/test split cross-validation protocol using the r2 and MSE values obtained for different combinations of parameters in the SVR (penalty C, kernel type and its parameters), we decided to employ a polynomial kernel of degree equal to 3 and a C value of 100, while for BRD4-BD1 inhibitors and the taxanes, a SVR with a linear kernel and penalty of one was used after following an analogous procedure.",

In this manner, there are n available predictions (as many as regressors trained with the subsets) per unlabelled sample in the learning pool, which are averaged and their variance used to represent the uncertainty of the predictions. In our case, a leave-one-out procedure was followed and the standard deviation of the predictions was used to rank the complexes for uncertainty selection.ii.Distance to the training set. Another approach (Fig. 1c) to measure the uncertainty of one particular sample involves calculating how distant is to all other samples in the training set. If the new sample is far from the others, the prediction is assumed to be less reliable since the sample probably lies outside the domain of applicability of the initial model. We have employed the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method [33], which calculates the differences in the local density of a given point with up to 5 neighbours of the training set.iii.Random selection.

            "text": "The reliability of the predictions from COMBINE models is usually difficult to assess. Several authors [28, 34, 35] have found inconsistencies in their performance depending on the parameters employed for energy calculations (e.g. dielectric constant), the binding modes of the compounds (e.g. lack of robust crystallographic evidence), the regression algorithm (e.g. PLS vs. SVM) and pre-treatment of the variables (e.g. scaling or feature selection). Motivated by this problem, we decided to introduce an approach to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions and, in this manner, implement a workflow that can guide practitioners to improve unsatisfactory or unreliable models. As a proof of concept, we selected the historical HIV-PR dataset, a set that contains 48 protease inhibitors with potencies ranging from 6 \u00b5M to 0.1 nM, and two simple uncertainty metrics: the distance to the training set and a pool of regressors (see methods section). Our simulation protocol, which consists of splitting the total learning pool in small batches of five compounds to be added iteratively to the training set, allows us to evaluate the evolution in the performance of the models using different strategies. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the active learning strategies based on both uncertainty estimators tested in this work outperform random selection of compounds and can produce models with less prediction error than their random counterparts with the same number of compounds in the training set. According to these results, the pool of regressors strategy seems also to obtain the best models, with a very promising first iteration compared to the other two models. To get some insight into the actual evolution of the models, we saved the individual results for the first run of the protocol for pool of regressors and random selection. Figure 3 shows the correlation of the experimental pIC50 values of the molecules in the test set vs. the predicted ones at each iteration. The initial model (iteration 0) presents an almost random output which agrees with averaged r2 and MSE values around 0 and 1.5 respectively (Fig. 2). Interestingly, after the first batch of compounds is added to the training set from the learning pool, the resulting model in the active learning strategy (pool of regressors) can produce much better correlated predictions (< r2 > ~ 0.6 and < MSE > ~ 1.1, Fig. 2) while random selection produced a model with virtually no improvement compared to the initial training set. From the second iteration onwards, the gains produced by AL seem to be reduced progressively until it approaches the performance of the full model. On the contrary, with a random selection of compounds, and in this particular simulation, the workflow needed to reach iteration 3, that is, 15 extra compounds to have a similar performance to the model in the first iteration of AL with just five compounds more.",

An identical protocol to HIV-PR was followed with the exception of the number of iterations (8 in this case), the use of distance-dependent dielectric constant in the cMMISMSA model and the linear kernel and penalty value of 1 in the SVR (see methods). For splits 1 and 2 (Supp. Figs. 1, 3) both AL protocols outperform clearly random selection, while for splits 4 and 5, the advantage, although present, it is not that large. In the case of split 3, the performance is roughly equivalent to random selection. It is also worth noting that both AL workflows (pool of regressors and distance to the training set) tend to show the same trends in performance, being successful in the same splits, with a slight advantage for the pool of regressors.",

This can also be observed looking at the simulation results individually (Supp. Fig. 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10), where some more challenging test sets need significantly more data than others to produce equivalent results (e.g. split 2 vs. 3). However, it is also clear that AL tends to produce less variability in the results (smaller error bars) at each iteration when compared to random selection. This finding, together with the fact that AL outperforms 80% of the time random selection while it does not underperform, seems to support the use of AL strategies in the taxanes set.",

AL performs best in split 4 and 5 (Supp. Figures 17 and 19), while in splits 1 and 3 (Supp. Figures 11 and 15) only one of the AL strategies seem to work (distance to the training set and pool of regressors respectively). In split 3 (Supp. Figure 15), AL performs equally to random selection. These numbers are, again, in agreement with the proportion of successful cases observed for the previous set. However, differences in the performance of AL are here less pronounced, probably due to the larger number of compounds in the set and the relatively lower complexity of the molecules. Another interesting observation is that the impact of AL seems to be more obvious in the first few iteration of the simulations (also observed in HIV-PR and taxanes) but, it also less evident (or negligible) if the initial training set, by chance, contains enough information to produce relatively reliable predictions of the test set (e.g. split 2 has r2 values consistently above 0.1 for all simulations, see Supp. Figures 13 and 14).",

Ideally, the model should quickly learn the right features to give an optimal performance for the molecules designed in the late stages of the program, that is, potent compounds, but with any prior knowledge of how these molecules look like since the initial training set will contain low to medium potencies. In the case of HIV-PR, when a time-split of the data was used, the method reported significant improvements over random sampling, which would enable us to recommend the use of the AL-COMBINE protocol with small sets. However, when a time-split was not available (taxanes and bromodomain inhibitors), we obtained more erratic outcomes, oscillating from great improvements in most sets, to minor changes and, finally, no difference to random selection in a few cases. However, in no case we have observed worse performance than a random selection. In the abscent of any information about the connection between the present SAR in the training set, with the \u201cfuture\u201d SAR, that is, the interesting compounds to predict, we can conclude that the method does no harm (primum non nocere) and gives a decent probability of enhacing the models (70\u201380% in our test) with a very small computational cost. The decission of selecting the molecules from an AL-COMBINE approach or directly from the predicted potencies, could be guided by the uncertainty from the different metrics that we propose in this work. If we have been \u201cgifted\u201d with a very informative training set at the beginning of our program, we might decide not to spend precious compound synthesis resources and biological assay slots improving the performance of a model that is already fit for purpose.",
