Sera were considered potentially positive when the optical density (OD) values were at or above the screening 0.15 cutoff value for N-ELISA or 0.1 for S-ELISA. Any serum potentially positive by N- or S-ELISA at a screening dilution of 1:400 was subsequently titered with serial 4-fold dilutions (1:100\u20131:6400) with OD cutoffs of 0.3 for the N and 0.2 for the S-ELISAs to determine end point titer and tested by MNT for confirmation. Neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV were detected by MNT assay performed in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment, as previously described [4]. The neutralization titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited the live MERS-CoV-mediated cytopathic effect in Vero cells in at least 1 of the 3 triplicate wells.",

The 2 cases with the earliest dates of illness onset (cases 1 and 2) were both present at the same coronary care unit (CCU) in hospital A on a single day (case 1 as a patient and case 2 as a visitor); however, no direct contact was documented between them. Before the 2015 outbreak involving the MERS-CoV deletion variants, the last identified MERS case in Jordan had been 8 months earlier, in December 2014. In the 2015 outbreak, cases 1 and 2 had both recently traveled to Jordan from locations on the Arabian Peninsula (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait City, Kuwait, respectively). Interestingly, viruses genetically similar to the viruses detected in cases 1 and 2 in Jordan, but without deletions, were concurrently circulating in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the period corresponding to the earliest cases in Jordan (August 2015) [15]. Neither case 1 nor case 2 reported contact with a known MERS-CoV patient, camels, or a health care setting outside of Jordan during their exposure period. A review of previous CCU admissions did not reveal other likely index case candidates. Genome sequence analysis could not definitively identify the antecedent virus. Despite an extensive investigation, epidemiologic evidence did not definitively determine which of these 2 cases may have been the index case. Subsequently, 3 patients (cases 3, 5, and 6) and 1 visitor (case 8) at hospital A were identified as cases. Cases 5 and 6 had been admitted in the CCU at hospital A MERS before symptom onset. No cases were identified among HCP at hospital A, including from the CCU. The wife of case 3 tested positive (case 11) shortly after case 3 died; a 726-nt deletion in the ORF4b and ORF5 genes was shared between this couple.",
