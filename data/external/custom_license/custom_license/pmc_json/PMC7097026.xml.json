The criteria for proving causality are complex and include (besides recognition of the clinical syndrome) serological diagnosis, identification of specific viral antigenemia, and detection in glomerular structures of viral antigens and host antibodies. According to Koch's postulates, the etiological link should be confirmed by complete cure following eradication of the virus, but this is not always possible. The concentration of viral antigens is higher in tissue than in the circulation, where antigens are complexed with specific autoantibodies. Virological and molecular analysis of pathologic tissues by in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction and ultrastructural analysis led to successful detection and identification of the virus. It should be noted that tubular uptake of viral particles is common and does not necessarily establish an etiological link with renal disease. Improvement of the renal disease concomitant with clearance of the suspected antigen, or recurrence of glomerulonephritis following reinfection, are additional clinical criteria.",

One major difference between the human and woodchuck studies is that the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) system has not been characterized in the latter. In clinical practice, regression of pathology following viral eradication is not easy to demonstrate because of ethical concerns relating to repeat renal biopsies in humans subsequent to clinical remission. As such, the diagnosis of HBV-associated renal disease usually relies heavily upon detection of HBV-specific antigen(s) in glomeruli.",

Renal manifestations include nephrotic (20%) or non-nephrotic proteinuria and microscopic hematuria.45 Acute nephritic syndrome is the presenting feature in about a quarter of cases. Renal insufficiency, frequently of mild severity, occurs in about half of patients. Over 80% of patients have refractory hypertension at presentation, which might be responsible for a considerable number of cardiovascular deaths.",

This disease does not frequently progress to uremia, despite the persistence of urinary abnormalities in the majority of patients. When such progression does occur, it tends to be in males and those of older age.

Notably, membranous nephropathy in HCV carriers is characterized by the absence of cryoglobulin and male predominance.47",

Before the association between HCV and cryoglobulinemic MCGN was established, steroids and cyclophosphamide were the mainstays of treatment. Our awareness of this link has facilitated a more rational approach to management of this condition. Controlled trials have shown that antiviral therapy with interferon-\u03b1 is associated with improvements in systemic symptoms of immune complex disease. Unfortunately, post-therapy relapse occurs in a large proportion of patients, particularly when interferon monotherapy is administered in short courses. Introduction of combination therapy with interferon-\u03b12b plus ribavirin was an important milestone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.48 This cocktail has also produced favorable results in mixed cryoglobulinemia, although non-responses and relapses after initial improvements still occur.49",

One therapeutic drawback is the hemolytic effect that complicates ribavirin therapy, particularly in patients with functional renal impairment. This difficulty has been overcome by adjusting the dose according to glomerular filtration rate instead of body weight alone, and utilizing recombinant erythropoietin to combat anemia. Post-treatment renal biopsy showed histological improvement in two of three patients who received combination therapy for 12 months.52",
