There is ample documentation1 for the confounding effects of such transmission on research of viral infections in experimental animals (often in the absence of clinical disease). Of even greater concern, outbreaks of infection among laboratory workers by zoonotic agents such as lymphotrophic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)2 and hantavirus3 are traceable to contaminated biological materials transplanted into animals. The biosecurity tenets of many research organizations require screening for viral agents of all cell lines, tumors, sera, and other biologicals before implantation or inoculation into animal models. Federal guidelines4,5 also dictate that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other biotechnology products derived from tissues or cell lines of animal origin are demonstrated to be free of viral contamination before their use for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.",

Typical testing involves inoculating mice by multiple routes with a test article and holding them in isolation for a minimum of four weeks6. Researchers then collect serum samples from the animals and test them for virus-specific antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), or hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays. Detection of virus-specific antibodies indicates the presence of that virus in the test article.

With each cycle of the PCR, newly synthesized DNA molecules may act as templates for further amplification. The result of the process is an exponential increase in the number of target sequences, potentially creating billions of copies (also referred to as 'amplicons') from a single DNA template. Subsequent detection of the PCR products involves performing gel electrophoresis on an aliquot of the reaction mixture. After staining for visualization, the DNA molecules appear as discrete bands separated on the basis of their length, allowing for identification of the PCR product if the target sequence was present in the original sample.",

A recent development that is particularly useful for diagnostic applications is the fluorogenic 5\u2032-nuclease assay23, also known as TaqMan PCR, which makes use of an additional dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe that specifically hybridizes to the PCR product (Fig. 1B). As the amplification progresses, the probe binds to the PCR product template and undergoes digestion by the polymerase enzyme, releasing a detectable fluorescent signal that may be read on a fluorometer after completion of the reaction or that can be monitored 'real-time' during the course of the reaction by a specialized thermocycler, permitting quantification of starting templates. Product detection by fluorescence permits a very high level of sensitivity, greatly simplifies post-PCR analysis, and lends itself to a 96-well plate format, allowing the use of semiautomated and automated procedures as throughput needs require.",

Because of the potential for infection, it is advisable to conduct MAP testing in facilities that are separate from areas used to house other animal studies. MAP testing requires immunocompetent mice free of antibodies against viral pathogens, and one must take additional precautions, such as using sterilized microisolation units and performing all animal manipulation in a biosafety cabinet, to avoid infection by viruses other than those potentially in the test articles and to prevent infection of other animals in the facility. Detection of antibodies (or enzyme levels, in the case of LDV) specific to the agents in question requires access to a serological testing laboratory.",
