In the study of Herberhold et al, rhinovirus was also the most common respiratory virus, identified in 67% of samples, followed by bocavirus in 53%, similar to our study but with different prevalences.16 In another study, adenovirus was the most common viral agent, isolated in 47.1% of patients, followed by enterovirus (40.5%), rhinovirus (38%), and bocavirus (29.8%).8 In the study from Sato et al, adenovirus was the most common viral agent, present in 80% of samples.17 Alkhalaf et al analyzed 106 palatine and pharyngeal tonsils of 57 patients undergoing routine tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. Employing the technique of real-time polymerase chain reaction, the authors identified 84 samples (72.4%) positive for adenovirus.18\n",

Some studies revealed that the adenoid tissue may be a reservoir of viruses. Comparing the prevalence of virus pre- and postoperatively, we aimed to analyze a possible influence of adenoid tissue in the maintenance of these viruses in secretions. After the analysis of preoperative nasopharyngeal samples, this study found that 33.3% of patients (n = 12) were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus. Of the 14 respiratory viruses isolated, 50% were rhinovirus. After surgery, the positivity of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions of these patients decreased: in only 13.9% of patients (n = 5) was at least 1 viral agent isolated in the sample. In the postoperative secretions, 8 respiratory viruses were detected, and adenoviruses were identified in 2 patients. These results suggest a decrease in the prevalence of the virus after surgery (p = 0.0522). However, the number of patients in the study is relatively small, and a greater number of samples are required to confirm or reject this hypothesis.",

These data suggest that the persistence or latency of respiratory viruses on nasopharyngeal and adenoid tissue after an acute infectious process may be related to the pathogenesis of lymphoid hypertrophy of the upper airways and that these tissues may function as a reservoir of virus, with possible influence on its transmission in the community. After adenoidectomy, a decrease in respiratory viruses present in nasopharyngeal secretions was observed. From this finding, we can infer a lower chance of occurrence of infections as well as secondary superinfections and virus transmission to contacts after surgery. Considering the age group studied, in which there is a greater interpersonal contact, this decrease in the circulation of respiratory viruses becomes important for public health, with positive impact on the quality of life of these children.",
