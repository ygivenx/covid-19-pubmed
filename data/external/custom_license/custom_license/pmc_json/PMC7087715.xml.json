My analysis of media reports and personal narratives about coping strategies during the two epidemics identifies three types of quarantines, which are respectively mandatory, voluntary, and coerced quarantines. These three types of quarantines can \u201coperate at the individual or population levels,\u201d as suggested by Gostin et al. (2003, 3231), and yet they differ from those identified by Gostin et al. because they shift attention from location and official strategies to motivation and grassroots tactics. These types of quarantines are characterized by different degrees of restriction of movement and isolation because of personal considerations, individual will, communal pressures, or social stigmatization.",

Mandatory quarantine often results from official or communal efforts at \u201cpinpointing and isolating high-risk patient groups in hospitals and institutions\u201d (Webster 2003, 1290). One instance of mandatory quarantine is the widespread use of community entry surveillance tools such as temperature monitoring and health registration forms to identify floating people returning from severely SARS affected regions such as Guangdong or Beijing. Returnees from epicenters were placed into 2-week quarantines, often in cabins or buildings outside villages where their homes were located. In other cases, people may be put under medical observation in quarantine camps, as happened to residents of Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong after a total of 329 SARS cases were reported in the residential building because of a defective sewage system (Greenfeld 2006; Hung 2003; Pomfret and Weiss 2003). In addition, medical workers who had close contact with SARS patients were isolated, often in hospitals, for medical observation and treatment if they developed any SARS symptoms.",

Those using voluntary quarantines may be individuals from epicenters, members of high-risk populations, or people highly concerned about possibly spreading the diseases through social or professional contacts. These people may employ measures such as home confinement for a certain period of time, avoidance of all unnecessary travel outside their homes, or self-imposed restricted movement for risk reduction purposes. Three medical professionals in Singapore voluntarily quarantined themselves either after developing fever symptoms or after learning that their patients were infected with SARS (Chia, 2003). They did so to protect their families, friends, and colleagues from potential health risks they might have presented, and they were cited by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as \u201cexamples of responsible behavior\u201d (Chia 2003).",

During emerging epidemics, some people experience intense fear, which can be associated with uncertainty, scarce information, and a widespread perception of loss of control (Eichelberger 2007, 1285). To cope with their sense of being out of control, people use whatever little information is available to them to respond psychologically and to take what they perceive as risk reduction measures, including quarantines (Strong 1990). Such bottom-up use of quarantines is often not required by public health policies, but people use them anyway as a coping tactic that gives them some interventional power and individual agency when faced with new epidemics. In examining the use of quarantines in extra-institutional and communal settings, this essay calls attention to the grassroots application of voluntary and coercive quarantines as individual and communal tactics to cope with both the uncertainties surrounding emerging epidemics and their accompanying social panics and stigmatization.",

As one of the most seriously affected hospitals, People\u2019s Hospital treated over 8,360 patients with fever with 205 of them diagnosed as SARS cases from April 5 to April 24.

Overwhelmed by large numbers of fever patients, hospital authorities decided to convert first the laundry room on April 7 and then the boiler room on April 13 into a SARS ward. While the first SARS ward held sick patients, the second ward contained infected medical staff. Moreover, its emergency room was packed with fever patients, many of them later diagnosed as SARS. The high in-hospital infection rate scared many cleaners and personal care workers away; doctors, nurses, and administrative staff had to clean SARS wards themselves. Moreover, the hospital was forced to convert its patio into a temporary medical observation center, which later became its \u201chotspot of infection\u201d (\u201cResolving Mysteries\u201d). Because of the lack of prevention guidelines and the heavy workload, a total of 93 medical workers and hospital staff contracted SARS during this period.

Migrant workers often worked in labor-intensive industries, lived in overcrowded dormitories, and had little access to healthcare. Often living from check to check, they could not afford medical bills incurred by major diseases. Getting fired for illness only further exacerbated their economic difficulty and threatened their daily survival. Therefore, migrant workers suffering from major illnesses often had to travel back home for low-cost family care (Tang 2003). To ensure the timely quarantine and treatment of farmers and migrant workers, China set aside a special fund of 2 billion yuan to provide free examinations, quarantines, and treatments to farmers who contracted SARS (\u201cMay 15\u201d). In addition, businesses were required to pay salaries to migrant workers who were quarantined or treated for SARS instead of firing them, thereby preventing mass exodus of migrant workers from SARS-affected areas. Official policies like these protected the economic interests of migrant workers affected by SARS or by quarantine orders, which in turn helped to humanize the anti-SARS policies and thus encouraged cooperation from affected citizens.",

Bao (2003) described his eventful travel from Beijing to Zejiang Province and then back to Beijing when his trip was accompanied by newly released reports about scattered cases in cities such as Hanzhou and Ningbo (Bao 2003, SARS journal). Officials issued orders to cancel all visiting and reception activities, and all travelers using public transport were required to fill in health registration forms to track their health conditions. People from Beijing were often met with suspicion and isolation efforts. In coastal cities in Zejiang, travelers from Beijing would be \u201cquarantined in small islands upon arrival,\u201d and in provinces adjacent to Beijing, most restaurants refused to provide service to such travelers in fear of possible infection (Bao 2003, \u201cSARS Journal\u201d). This public campaign functioned to put all travelers and returnees from epicenters into mandatory quarantines and helped to prevent widespread SARS outbreaks in the countryside and regions little affected by SARS. Indeed, the fully mobilized grassroots forces functioned as the frontline defense to prevent dissemination of the SARS virus in the countryside. It should be emphasized that in cities and villages little affected by SARS, the trope of social responsibility worked alongside concerns for communal and individual health, which in turn resulted in creative, locally-invented prevention tactics to prevent possible \u201cinvasion\u201d of SARS.",

Instead of passively falling victim to coerced quarantines, many students returning to China enacted voluntary 1-week-long home quarantines to watch for flu symptoms, which greatly reduced the risk of introducing H1N1 flu to the larger community (\u201cAbout 10,000\u201d).",

On May 20, numerous official recommendations were released by Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, and Beijing Municipal Government, urging overseas returnees to adopt the same tactic. In addition, open advocacy letters were issued by top leaders, calling for understanding and cooperation from overseas returnees in \u201cthe national campaign against H1N1 flu\u201d (\u201cBeijing Health Bureau\u201d). Eventually, overseas Chinese were reabsorbed into the nationalistic discourses and were urged to impose self-discipline and home quarantines upon arrival in China both to protect their families and communities and to behave as responsible citizens. It should be stressed that the official request for home quarantines functioned mostly as a symbolic gesture rather than a rigorously implemented order. Indeed, no mechanism existed to track down and to enforce quarantine orders for overseas returnees. The implementation of this policy appealed to the trope of patriotic citizens and relied largely on individual compliance.",

In other words, is it a top-down order or is it caused by bottom-up concerns and/or discrimination?What motivates such quarantine practices: scientifically driven public health measures, concerns with self or communal survival, or politically and ideologically motivated stigmatization?\n",

While quarantine orders may have come from governments or local officials, local publics actively participated in the implementation and coordination processes to ensure individual compliance. For instance, communal volunteers and anti-SARS forces collaborated closely to meet the daily survival needs of those under home quarantines or medical isolation. Family members of migrant workers worked closely with local officials to dissuade their children or spouses from returning to the countryside, and for those who did return, family members monitored their daily temperature to avoid possible import of the SARS virus. While volunteers and family members worked together to defend their communities against SARS, migrant workers also shouldered their own share of social responsibility either by continuing their work in the epicenters or by observing quarantine orders in their hometowns.",
