We have observed that current diagnostic guidelines may not be sufficiently sensitive for assessing patients before admission to hospital. For example, although a temperature of >38\u00b0C is part of the diagnostic criteria (2), this symptom was notably absent in two patients. The lack of a fever in case-patient 4 may have been the result of long-term steroid use. Case-patient 6 never had a documented temperature >37.7\u00b0C and was hypothermic throughout his hospitalization. In addition, a subset of patients may have fever and myalgias without respiratory complaints or chest x-ray changes until later (cases 3 and 11). Booth et al., in a retrospective analysis of 144 patients with SARS, reported that 11% of patients had no respiratory symptoms and would not meet current criteria for SARS, despite having fever, contact history, and chest x-ray infiltrates (9). Rainer et al., in a study of 515 patients attending a SARS screening clinic, found that current World Health Organization guidelines, which emphasize respiratory tract symptoms, had a low sensitivity of 26% (10). We expanded our isolation criteria to include all patients with undifferentiated febrile illness and chest x-ray infiltrates with or without fever or respiratory symptoms until an alternative diagnosis is made, or until they defervesce and serial chest x-ray findings are normal.",

However, a contact history may not be forthcoming at the initial interview. In Singapore, SARS is an imported infection in which the epidemiology remains well defined with clear lines of secondary spread in the hospitals and community (3). Emphasis is placed on using local epidemiologic clues to elicit a history of visits or previous admissions to Tan Tock Seng Hospital or other healthcare facilities and to inquire whether any family members are ill or hospitalized. Patients without a contact history are still isolated if the clinical suspicion is high. A national computerized database of SARS patients and their contacts has been established to assist with this process. An epidemiology team is also used to perform more exhaustive contact tracing and liaisons with other healthcare facilities. This team also monitors and investigates any clusters of pneumonias within our hospital. Suspected case-patients are then immediately transferred to the isolation area for further investigation.",

Virus transmission is likely due to droplet infection, but fecal-oral transmission has also been reported (11). The role of fomites has yet to be defined; preliminary data suggest that the virus can remain viable at room temperature for at least 2 days. Recognizing that patients with unsuspected cases of SARS could slip through our triage system onto the general wards (see case 6), all hospital staff with direct patient contact were also required to wear full PPE beginning April 8.

Reports of protected healthcare workers becoming infected during intubation of SARS patients have also emerged from Canada (12).
