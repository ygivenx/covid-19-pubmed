            "text": "So far two types of coronavirus surface receptor have been identified5. The group II coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) uses murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs), members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors6. A number of group I coronaviruses, for example human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, require the zinc metalloprotease aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) for entry into their target cells7,8,9. Recently, a distinct coronavirus has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS, an acute pulmonary syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia that results in progressive respiratory failure and death in close to 10% of cases10,11,12,13. Analysis of the SARS-CoV genome suggests that this virus does not belong to any of the three defined coronavirus groups, and that the SARS-CoV S protein is similarly distinct14,15. Similar to the analogous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza proteins, the S proteins of some coronaviruses\u2014including MHV and the group III coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus\u2014are cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2) by a cellular protease in virus-producing cells16,17. The S proteins of other coronaviruses, including those of group I and probably SARS-CoV, are not cleaved in virus-producing cells14,15,18. Nonetheless, S1 and S2 domains of these latter S proteins can be identified through their homology with the S1 and S2 subunits of cleaved coronavirus S proteins. The S1 domains of all characterized coronaviruses mediate an initial high-affinity association with their respective receptors19,20,21.",

We first investigated whether the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein could bind to Vero E6 cells. Figure 1a demonstrates that a protein expressing residues 12\u2013672 of the SARS-CoV S protein, fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin-\u03b31 (IgG1; S1\u2013Ig), specifically recognized a moiety present on Vero E6 cells but did not bind human kidney 293T cells. Using this same fusion protein (Fig. 1c) or a carboxy terminally tagged form of the S1 domain (Fig. 1b), a protein band of approximately 110 kDa could be immunoprecipitated from metabolically labelled Vero E6 cells lysed with 0.3% n-decyl-\u03b2-d-maltopyranoside in phosphate-buffered saline. When the immunoprecipitated protein was incubated with PNGase F, an enzyme that removes N-glycosylation, two bands were observed at approximately 80\u201385 and 100 kDa (Fig. 1c, lanes 3 and 4).",

Three human proteins were identified whose sequences were consistent with the masses of tryptic fragments obtained from this band.

Eight independent tryptic fragments consistent with sequences comprising 17% of the amino acid sequence of human ACE2 were also identified (Supplementary Information).

For instance, cells expressing the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 can form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5 (ref. 24). Because syncytia have been observed in Vero E6 cultures infected with SARS-CoV, in SARS-CoV-infected primates, and in SARS patients10,12,13, we investigated whether 293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV S protein could fuse with 293T cells expressing ACE2. Figure 3a shows that these cells formed syncytia efficiently. As expected, 293T cells transfected with CD4 and CCR5 formed many syncytia with cells expressing HIV-1 gp160 (top left), but not with cells expressing SARS-CoV S protein (bottom left). In contrast, 293T cells expressing ACE2 did not form syncytia with cells expressing gp160 (top right), but formed many large syncytia with cells expressing S protein (bottom right). 293T cells expressing S protein also efficiently formed syncytia with ACE2- but not mock-transfected HeLa cells (not shown). Syncytia formation between S protein- and ACE2-expressing cells was blocked by more than 95% by affinity-purified antibody raised against ACE2, but not by control antibody (Fig. 3b). These data demonstrate that the ability of the SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion is dependent on the presence of ACE2.",

After 2 days in culture, numerous detached, round and floating cells were observed in cultures of infected ACE2-transfected cells (not shown), consistent with viral replication. In contrast, infected mock-transfected cells and uninfected ACE2-transfected cells were indistinguishable from uninfected control cells, and these cells displayed none of the signs of cytopathicity that were observed in infected ACE2-expressing cells. Figure 4 shows that ACE2- but not mock-transfected 293T cells supported efficient replication of SARS-CoV. We measured viral genomic RNA in cell supernatants by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT\u2013PCR). We found that viral genome copies in ACE2-transfected cells increased by more than 100,000-fold in the first 48 h (Fig. 4a, bottom panel). In contrast, genome copies in mock-transfected cells increased tenfold in the same period (top panel), indicating some basal replication on 293T cells. In addition, virus titres in supernatants from infected ACE2- and mock-transfected cells were measured by titration onto Vero E6 cells. As shown in Fig. 4b, virus stock obtained 96 h after infection from ACE2-transfected cells efficiently replicated on Vero E6 cells, with visible cytopathic effect (CPE) up to and including the highest dilution assayed (1:6,561), whereas virus stock obtained from mock-transfected cells induced no CPE beyond a 1:27 dilution. Consistent with the basal replication observed in both infection assays, minor expression of ACE2 on 293T cells was subsequently detected by an anti-ACE2 antibody (Supplementary Information). We also investigated the ability of anti-ACE2 antibody to inhibit viral replication on Vero E6 cells. Anti-ACE1 antibody had no observable effect on virally induced cytopathicity, whereas anti-ACE2 antibody inhibited cytopathicity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4c). Collectively, these data show that ACE2 contributes substantially to the efficiency of SARS-CoV replication.",

Moreover, syncytia formation and viral replication were specifically inhibited by an anti-ACE2 antibody. These data demonstrate that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Real-time PCR analysis of 72 human tissues has demonstrated efficient expression of ACE2 messenger RNA in the bronchus and lung parenchyma as well as in the heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract23. Lung and kidney are also the primary sites of expression of murine ACE2 (ref. 22). This tissue distribution is consistent with the pathology of SARS, which is characterized by an acute infection of the lungs10,11,12. SARS-CoV has also been found in kidney tissue of infected patients10, and it replicates efficiently on the primate kidney cell lines FRhK-4 and Vero E6 (refs 10, 12). Active viral replication in the small and large intestine has been observed25. Detection of virus in the faeces11 may reflect expression of ACE2 message in these tissues23. The physiological role of ACE2 in most of these tissues has not been defined, although ACE2 is thought to be an essential regulator of cardiac function26. Candidate substrates, some of which regulate vasopermeability, have been identified27. It is unclear whether SARS-CoV interferes with ACE2 enzymatic activity in a manner that contributes to the pathogenesis of SARS.",

Alternatively, a soluble form of the receptor itself may slow viral replication in an infected individual. Identification of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV receptor will facilitate description of the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, presumably the most effective target epitope of an S1-protein-based subunit vaccine. Also, it is likely that a cell line approved for vaccine production and made permissive for viral replication by ACE2 expression will be the most efficient large-scale producer of a whole-killed or attenuated virus for use as a vaccine. A mouse transgenic for human ACE2 may be useful as an animal model of SARS.

Cells were monitored for cytopathic effect for 4 days. Aliquots of cell supernatants were collected 0, 48 and 96 h after wash. RNA was recovered using a viral RNA mini-prep kit (Qiagen). Semi-quantitative RT\u2013PCR was performed using a nested protocol as described by ref. 11. Positive control RNA was provided by C. Drosten (Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, National Reference Center for Tropical Diseases). Virus titration was performed by seeding 5 \u00d7 103 Vero E6 cells per well in 96-well microtitre plates 1 day before infection. Culture supernatant from infected 293T cells was added to the first set of wells in triplicate and serially diluted. Cells were monitored for CPE 3 days after infection of Vero E6 cells. The effect of affinity-purified goat anti-ACE1 or -ACE2 antibody on SARS-CoV-induced cytopathicity was measured by reading absorbance at 492 nm of cells incubated with CellTiter 96 (Promega).",
