There are, in principle, two mechanisms by which pandemic influenza could originate: first, by direct transmission (of a mutated virus perhaps) from animal (bird) to humans, as happened in 1918 with the 'Spanish influenza' (H1N1)5; or second, through reassortment of an avian influenza virus with a human influenza virus, as occurred in 1957 with the 'Asian influenza' (H2N2) and, again, in 1968 with the 'Hong Kong influenza' (H3N2)6,7 (Fig. 1).",

The H+ ions are imported through the M2 (matrix 2) channels10; the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein, with the amino-acid residues facing the ion-conducting pore, is shown in Fig. 3a (Ref. 11).

The global circulation of adamantane-resistant H3N2 viruses is unprecedented and does not seem to be mediated by continued selective drug pressure. It could be argued that if resistance exists in a relatively homogeneous strain of H3N2, and if antiviral use would be curtailed, susceptible strains might (re-)emerge and adamantanes might regain their utility against both epidemic and pandemic influenza15.",

Whether any of these new derivatives might offer any advantage in terms of potency, selectivity, safety or resistance profile over the parent compounds amantadine and rimantadine needs to be further explored. Also, further investigation of the antiviral potential of other 'cage-like' compounds structurally related to the adamantyl entity, such as bananin23, might be worthwhile.

They served as the lead compounds for the development of the neuraminidase inhibitors that are marketed at present for the treatment (and prophylaxis) of influenza A and B virus infections: zanamivir (Relenza, 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en, GG167)30 and oseltamivir (Tamiflu, GS4071 ethyl ester, GS4104, Ro64-0796)31 (Fig. 5a). Both compounds have been found to be highly potent inhibitors (IC50 \u2264 1 ng ml\u22121) of the influenza neuraminidase, to inhibit influenza A and B virus replication in vitro and in vivo (mice, ferrets), to be well tolerated, and to be both prophylactically (significant reduction in number of ill subjects) and therapeutically (significant reduction in duration of illness) effective against influenza A and B virus infection in humans. A crucial difference between zanamivir and oseltamivir, however, is that zanamivir has to be administered by inhalation (10 mg twice daily), whereas oseltamivir can be administered orally (75 or 150 mg twice daily).",

As shown in particular for oseltamivir, the earlier the administration, the shorter the duration of fever, the greater the alleviation of symptoms and the faster the return to baseline activity and health scores32. Oseltamivir treatment of influenza illness reduces lower respiratory tract complications, particularly bronchitis and pneumonia, concomitantly with a reduction in antibiotic use and need for hospitalization33. Also, post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir, 75 mg once daily for seven days, was found to protect close contacts of influenza-infected persons against influenza illness and to prevent spread within households34. Post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir can be considered an effective option to prevent the transmission of influenza within households35. It should be recognized, however, that oseltamivir is less effective against influenza B than against influenza A with regard to duration of fever and virus persistence36.",

Two structures of the influenza A virus neuraminidase have now been solved: the first containing the N1 neuraminidase of H5N1, and the second containing the N2 neuraminidase as in H3N238 (Fig. 5c). The neuraminidase inhibitors make contact with arginine in position 292 through their carboxylic acid group, and with glutamic acid in position 119 through their basic amine (in the case of oseltamivir) or guanidinium (in the case of zanamivir) group. So, it is not surprising that at these positions mutations (R292K, E119G) can arise that engender resistance to both zanamivir and oseltamivir39. The R292K mutation causes high-level resistance to oseltamivir but only low-level (5\u201330-fold) resistance to zanamivir. In a comprehensive study of more than 1,000 clinical influenza isolates recovered from 1996 to 1999, there was no evidence of naturally occurring resistance to either oseltamivir or zanamivir in any of the isolates40. However, in children treated for influenza with oseltamivir, Kiso et al.41 found neuraminidase mutations in viruses from nine patients (18%), six of whom had mutations at position 292 (R292K) and two at position 119 (E119V). Zanamivir-resistant influenza H3N2 viruses might not readily arise in vivo owing to their poor viability (reduced fitness)42.",

RSV infection is the only (\u2212)RNA virus infection for which aerosolized ribavirin has been formally approved. Oral ribavirin is also used, in combination with parenteral PEGylated interferon-\u03b1, in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The intravenous form of ribavirin has been registered for the treatment of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). In addition to ribavirin, viramidine \u2014 which can be considered to be the amidine prodrug of ribavirin(Fig. 6) \u2014 has been accredited with marked potential as anti-influenza drug76. Ribavirin is notable for not generating drug resistance, and resistance of influenza-virus replication to ribavirin has, to the best of my knowledge, not been reported so far. Obviously, the lack of drug-resistance is due to the fact that ribavirin's main target of antiviral action is a cellular enzyme: inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (responsible for the conversion of IMP to xanthosine 5\u2032-monophosphate), a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of GTP and viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 6).",

This binding site is also required for efficient virus replication. A fragment of CPSF30, termed F2F3 because it spans the second and third zinc-finger domains, was found to specifically bind to the CPSF30 binding site: it inhibited influenza-A-virus replication but did not inhibit the 3\u2032-end processing of cellular pre-mRNAs.

In the therapy (or prophylaxis) of influenza-virus infections, the combination of (PEGylated) interferon and ribavirin could be further complemented with amantadine (or rimantadine). This triple-drug combination has shown efficacy in the treatment of chronic HCV infection115. Against influenza, such a triple-drug regimen might theoretically be expected to yield a beneficial outcome. The three drugs are, individually, all active against influenza-virus replication in vitro and act through different mechanisms, which implies that, when combined, they might achieve an additive or even synergistic action, while reducing the risk of emergence of drug-resistant virus variants. As early as 1984, Hayden et al.116 pointed to the additive synergistic action between interferon-\u03b12 and rimantadine or ribavirin. Similarly, combinations of (PEGylated) interferon with neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir or peramivir) could also be considered, and so might combinations of ribavirin (or viramidine) with the neuraminidase inhibitors.",
