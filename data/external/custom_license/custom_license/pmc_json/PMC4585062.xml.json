Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, sp. Avian coronavirus) belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Gammacoronavirus. In India, vaccination against IB is carried out using Massachusetts 41 (Ma41) strain. Different IBV variants have emerged causing nephropathogenic and reproductive problems which infected the vaccinated flocks and hence it demands a dramatic change in vaccination programmes. IB is known to be one of the major contagious diseases of the respiratory and urogenital tract of chickens [7, 13]. IBV is a very dynamic and evolving virus, causing major economic losses to the global poultry industry [1].",

IBV was first recognized as avian respiratory pathogen in 1930, after that many IBV vaccines were introduced to tackle this problem {H52, H120, M41, 4/91(793/B) and other strains}. Recently, different IBV variants have emerged causing nephropathogenic and reproductive problems which demands a dramatic change in vaccination programmes [17]. IB vaccine has been produced by passage of the virus in embryonated eggs. The main barriers to producing recombinant vaccines against IBV appear to be reproduction of the conformationally dependent epitopes on the spike glycoprotein that induces neutralizing antibodies and a protective local immune response in the upper respiratory tract of the bird [8].",

The amino acid sequences of the Anand isolates and vaccine virus showed no variation. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment revealed that all the strains under comparison had similar amino acid sequences except the reference vaccine virus strain Mass41, which showed I (isoleucine) and S (serine) at position 246 and 379, while all the other strains including Anand isolates showed T (threonine) and L (leucine) at the same positions. This again substantiates the earlier observation that our isolates were more similar to the reference vaccine strains Ma5 and H120 than Mass41 strain. The nucleotide/aminoacid differences between IBV Anand isolates and other reported sequences were based on the Clustal Alignment of the Nucleotide sequences of S1 subunit fragment of Anand isolates, vaccine strain and reference strains as mentioned in Table 3. The three reference vaccine strains i.e. Ma 5, H120 and Mass41 showed SNVs at positions 708, 1143 and 1146 with \u2018C\u2019, \u2018T\u2019 and \u2018A\u2019 respectively, while the Anand isolates including the vaccine strain showed \u2018T\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 at the same positions. Mass41 (AY851295) showed additional seven SNVs at positions 737, 846, 861, 1017, 1104, 1119 and 1136 with T, T, T, C, T, T, and C nucleotide respectively, while all other strains showed C, A, C, T, C, C and T at the respective positions. Thus, Mass41 strain showed maximum variation of ten nucleotides at different positions, which also showed the least percent nucleotide identity with our isolates. This indicates that our isolates were more similar at S1 subunit nucleotide level with the reference Ma5 and H120 vaccine strains than the reference Mass41 strain (Table 3).",

Nephropathogenic reference isolates also formed well defined separate clusters II and III with nucleotide identity of 63.27\u201369.59 and 77.59\u201387.05 % respectively with Anand isolates. Grouping of Anand isolates in a separate cluster I at a genetic distance with the nephropathogenic strains further indicate the fast emergence of variants in IBV. The Anand isolates showed similarities in the range of 77.59\u201378.08 % with earlier reported isolate of Gujarat and 78.64\u201379.19 % with the Tamil Nadu (India/NMK/72/IVRI/10) isolate. The sequence of Gujarat IBV isolate was reported in the year 2009 and the lower similarity as observed in the current study indicates further genetic changes in the circulating IBV in Gujarat, which may partially explain the increasing incidences of IB in the country in spite of the vaccination programme.",

The finding of IBV strains in field samples and its crucial genetic distance with other reported IBV isolates demands a continuous scientific effort in the country to monitor and characterize the circulating IBV so as to get rid off this important disease menace faced by poultry population.",
