There are three types of influenza viruses: influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B and influenza virus type C. Types A and B are the most commonly isolated while type C is rare and often not included in routine diagnostic test. Influenza viruses type A are further sub-typed based on the sequence of two glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) [20]. Influenza viruses cause annual, seasonal epidemic characterized by an increase in the frequency of upper respiratory symptoms seen in the community between December and May in the northern hemisphere [21]. Although the infection usually remains limited to the upper respiratory tract in most patients, complications due to influenza viruses have been reported in HSCT and SOT patients, especially lung transplant recipients [18,22,23]. In one study, the frequency of pneumonia caused by influenza viruses was 30% with a fatality rate of 15% in HSCT recipients [12]. However, reports on frequency of complications has varied (7\u201344%) with fatality ranging from 15 to 28% in HSCT recipients [18]. In SOT, the complication rate varies based on the organ transplanted with lung transplants recipients being particularly at increased risk [22,23].",

The seasonality of RSV follows closely that of influenza viruses with increased incidence in the winter months in the northern hemisphere [24]. In transplant patients and young children, infection with RSV can result in serious complications [25,26]. As such, in most centers, detection of RSV pre-transplant results in a delay of SCT until patient clears the infection. In one study of HSCT recipients, 80\u201390% of patients with upper respiratory RSV infection developed pneumonia with 30\u201340% exhibiting symptoms within 7 days following upper respiratory tract symptoms [26]. In a large study of children under 5 years of age, the incidence of RSV infection was 18%. RSV infections occurred in previously healthy children with no pre-existing conditions. Risk factors were identified only for those under 2 year of age [25].",

There are four predominant PIV serotypes including: PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4 [27]. Until recently, PIV-4 was rarely isolated since most diagnostic assays available did not include reagents for the detection of PIV-4 and so less information is available on this PIV subtype. In the northern hemisphere, PIV occurs year-round with PIV-1 occurring most frequently in the fall, PIV-2 occurring in the fall to early winter and PIV-3 occuring in the spring and summer months [24,27]. Infections caused by PIV are usually mild, ranging from asymptomatic shedding to the common cold, croup and bronchiolitis. Similar to RSV, PIV infection occurs frequently in children, with most children exposed to PIV-3 by the age of two and PIV-1 by the age of 5 [24]. The reported incidence of PIV in HSTC populations ranges from 0.2 to 18% with 13 to 43% progressing to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and 12 to 50% of these LRTI resulting in death with most infections caused by PIV-3 [18,28]. In lung transplant recipients, PIV LRTI have been associated with high rate of allograft rejection [29].",

Several reports have linked rhinoviruses with more severe presentations including otitis media, bronchiolitis and exacerbation of asthma in children [41]. In immunocompromised hosts, severe complications including pneumonia, can occur. In one recent study, the severity of rhinovirus infection in immunocompromised patients was similar to that of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A [42].

B. pertussis causes pertussis or whooping cough primarily in non-vaccinated children and in adults, the infection is associated with a persistent cough of up to 2 weeks [48]. Atypical organisms, including M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, account for about one third of cases of bacterial pneumonia [19,49]. Unlike other common bacteria associated with these symptoms, B. pertussis, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae do not grow readily on media used for routine bacterial culture and therefore require a high level of suspicion from the clinician to inform the laboratory and request specific diagnostic tests. In one study, persistent cough of at least 2 weeks was observed in children infected with one or more of these three organisms underscoring the need for sensitive and specific diagnosis to guide therapy [50].",

In addition, novel viruses, including bocavirus and novel CoVs, are increasingly being recognized as causes of respiratory tract illness. Given the non-specific nature of the respiratory symptoms, the ability to detect these novel viruses as well as other significant pathogens is paramount for optimal patient care. The FilmArray RP is the most extensive panel that is currently FDA cleared for rapid detection of respiratory tract pathogens. Although its adenovirus assays still require improvement, the overall clinical sensitivity and specificity of the FilmArray RP assay is better than conventional methods and comparable to other high complexity multiplexed molecular assays on the market.",

However, the design of broadly multiplexed assays is challenging as multiplex PCR assays are subject to decreased sensitivity due in part to, targets\u2019 competition and primer dimers formation [64]. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the FilmArray RP in published reports varied between 85\u2013100% and 100%, respectively with the sensitivity of the adenovirus assays remaining a challenge even in the new version of the assay. However, even with the lower sensitivity of the adenovirus, the FilmArray RP has drastically changed the diagnostic landscape and allowed implementation of a sensitive and rapid molecular assay in a wide range of diagnostic settings [73,74].",

It is important to note however that as extensive as the FilmArray RP panel is, other important bacterial causes of pneumonia including S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, are not included on the panel. When compared to other FDA cleared multiplexed assay (Table 1), the FilmArray RP has the greatest number of targets in its panel, the simplest workflow, the shortest turn-around-time and the highest reagent cost [59,65]. The true value of the FilmArray RP assay lies in its ability to provide actionable results to clinicians and to facilitate the flow of patients in the hospital by providing infection control staff with real-time information.",

The FilmArray RP tests for a wide range of pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity and in a timely manner. As such, the FilmArray RP has raised the expectations of both the clinical laboratories and clinicians as to what is possible for the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of infectious diseases in general. The next 5 years should see the continued increase in the options for rapid, sensitive and simple to perform molecular assays for infectious disease diagnosis.",

In this era of health care reform, clinical laboratories and hospitals are constantly faced with the challenge of delivering the best patient care possible in the most cost-effective way.
