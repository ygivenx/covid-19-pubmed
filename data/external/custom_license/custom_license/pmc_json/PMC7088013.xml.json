            "text": "Dogs and cats are the most popular species of companion animals (pets) and play an important part in our daily lives. Companion animals are also an important \u201cOne Health\u201d component, in which they not only provide many physiological, psychological, and social benefits to humans, but also serve as a reservoir for zoonotic diseases (Matchock 2015; Takashima and Day 2014). Furthermore, a number of parasite species can cause mild to severe diseases in dogs (Robertson and Thompson 2002). Many parasites carried by pet dogs may be transmittable to humans, including cestodes (e.g., echinococcosis), nemotodes (e.g., toxocariosis, dirofilariosis and onchocerciasis), and protozoa (e.g., leishmaniosis, giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis) (Baneth et al. 2016; Gracio et al. 2015; Grinnage-Pulley et al. 2016; Tasic-Otasevic et al. 2015). Additionally, people with immature, weakened, and/or compromised immune systems (e.g., infants, elderly, AIDS patients, and organ transplantation recipients) are susceptible to infections with a wider range of parasitic species, such as Cryptosporidium canis that typically do not infect immunocompetent humans (Adamu et al. 2014; Cama et al. 2007).",

This parasite was detected using both microscopic and PCR methods. A sample was considered positive when either one or both of the two methods produced positive detection. Between the two methods, nested PCR displayed better sensitivity in detection (11.1%, n = 54) than microscopy (8.7%, n = 42). There were 34 specimens with positive detections by both methods (7.0%, n = 34), whereas there were 20 and 8 specimens that were either PCR-positive but microscopic-negative or microscopic-positive but PCR negative, respectively. Kappa inter-rater agreement test indicated that the \u201cstrength of agreement\u201d between the two methods was \u201cgood\u201d (Kappa = 0.677, SE = \u00b10.057). (2) Cryptosporidium species were detected by nested PCR amplification of SSU rRNA gene. It represented the second most prevalent parasite group (4.9%, n = 24). (3) Coccidia (Cystoisospora spp.) was the third most prevalent group (4.3%, n = 21). All observed coccidian oocysts belonged to Cystoisospora species, but they were not identified at species level. (4) Trichomonads (4.3%, n = 21) were observed but not determined at genus/species level. They were most likely Pentatrichomonas hominis or Tritrichomonas foetus. (5) Ascarids (3.5%, n = 17) were all Toxocara canis based on egg morphology and measurement. (6) Whipworm (Trihuris vulpis) was observed in 3 dog (0.6%). (7) A single case of tapeworm belonging to Dipylidium caninum was observed in this study (0.2%, n = 1). Among them, the positive rate of G. duodenalis was statistically significantly higher than those of other six parasite groups (p < 0.0001 by Fisher\u2019s exact test), while those of whipworm and tapeworm were significantly lower than the other five groups (p < 0.05 or better) (Fig. 1a). However, there were no significant differences between cryptosporidial, coccidia, trichomonads, and ascarids (p > 0.05 for all possible pairs). Again, Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected by PCR (vs. others by microscopic examination). The comparison of infection rates between these two protozoa and other parasites was not completely fair but provides a rough idea on the status of parasites in the companion dogs in Beijing.",

Fisher\u2019s exact test was employed to evaluate whether the positive rate of one specific breed differed significantly from that of the remaining breeds (i.e., the total rate after excluding the breed being tested), in which border collie and bulldog displayed significantly higher positive rates (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 by Fisher\u2019s exact test, respectively), and the poodle showed significantly lower positive rates (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1b, Table 2).

Among the risk factors, age displayed significant negative correlation with parasite infections (Table 3). The chance to carry intestinal parasites was significantly higher in \u2264 6 months old dogs (overall infection rate = 39.9%, OR = 5.0, p < 0.0001), whereas the chance was significantly lower in \u2265 12 months old dogs (rate = 8.3%, OR = 0.6, p < 0.0001; vs. rate = 19.0% in the 6\u201312 months age group) (Table 3).

Protection from parasite infections by vaccination was statistically significant, although less expected because the vaccines were originally designated for protecting dogs from certain viral and bacterial pathogens, i.e., vaccination by either one or more of the following vaccines: Nobivac DHPPi (canine distemper virus, herpes I, canine parvovirus and canine parainfluenza virus; MSD animal health, New Zealand], Nobivac DHPPi + Lepto (Leptospira canicola and L. icterohemorrhaiae] (MSD animal health), Vanguard plus 5 (canine distemper virus, herpes I/II, canine parvovirus, canine parainfluenza virus) (Zoetis, USA), or Vanguard plus 5/CV-1 (L. canicola, L. icterohemorrhaiae and canine coronavirus) (Zoetis). We speculate that vaccinations significantly reduced (if not fully eliminated) the potential negative effect of common viral infections on the immunity status of dogs to flight parasite infections as postulated in the case of coinfection of parvovirus and Cryptosporidium in a puppy (Denholm et al. 2001). It is also likely that pet owners who had their dogs vaccinated might tend to follow veterinarian\u2019s instructions more closely on hygiene practice.",

Further analysis revealed that deworming reduced the infections by both protozoa and helminths. Statistical significance was observed in the reduction of protozoan infection (rate = 13.6%, OR = 0.4, p < 0.001; vs. 26.8% in non-vaccinated) and not in the reduction of helminth infection (rate = 6.4%, OR = 0.6, p = 0.1355; vs. 10.5% in non-vaccinated). However, while we were unable to gain details from the clients on the deworming drugs used for their dogs, the four deworming formulas commonly used by veterinarians in China were mainly labeled as anthelminthic, including Drontal Plus flavor (praziquantel/pyrantel pamoate/febantel) against helminths (nematodes and tapeworms); fenbendazole tablets against roundworms, whipworms, hookworms, and some tapeworms (but ineffective against Dipylidium caninum); and Heartguard Plus or Iverhart Plus (ivermection/pyrantel) against heartworm, ascarids and hookworms. On the other hand, most of the ingredients in these formulas were also experimentally shown to have efficacy against some protozoan parasites, such as Giardia spp. [e.g., (Barr et al. 1994; Bowman et al. 2009; Foletto et al. 2015; Giangaspero et al. 2002; Montoya et al. 2008; Moron-Soto et al. 2017; Zajac et al. 1998)], which might explain partially the benefits of these deworming formulas against protozoan infections. Additionally, many companion dogs might have received specific anti-protozoan treatments, but their owners simply considered all treatments as deworming.",

Among the two common trichomonads (n = 21 in this study), Pentatrichomonas hominis is zoonotic and more common in dogs in China and many other regions (Grellet et al. 2013; Li et al. 2016; Tolbert et al. 2012). However, P. hominis is generally considered nonpathogenic to humans (Gookin et al. 2007; Meloni et al. 2011). Tritrichomonas foetus is less common in dogs and not considered a human pathogen, although it may cause genitourinary infection in cattle and diarrhea in cats and dogs (Gookin et al. 2005; Michi et al. 2016; Tolbert and Gookin 2016). However, a rare case of T. foetus peritonitis was reported in an immunodeficient patient (Lacassin 2005), implying its potential to cause opportunistic infection in humans. Among dog ascarids, Toxocara canis is the most common parasite causing toxocariasis in humans. In this survey, we observed 17 cases of T. canis among 485 dogs with diarrhea, suggesting that companion dogs may serve as a source for transmitting this roundworm to humans.",
