However, the frequency of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in each day of treatment with oseltamivir could not be calculated because of a lack of treatment history data. This timing is consistent with that for OR seasonal influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, which typically emerge 3\u20136 days after oseltamivir treatment (36\u201338). Additionally, we also observed the rapid emergence of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus within 48 hours of oseltamivir exposure (39). Nontheless, 6 cases occurred in untreated patients. Indeed, the OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the Oita case may likely be a natural occurrence.

Additionally, as first priority for prophylaxis of both OR and OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection should be vaccination, but not antiviral agents. Conversely, a preclinical animal model showed that OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had high potential to acquire transmissibility without losing viral fitness (24\u201326).

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (A/H1N1pdm) surveillance in Japan was divided into 4 stages depending on the prevalence situation, as shown in panel B: a) case-based surveillance (April 28\u2013July 23), b) outbreak and hospitalization surveillance (July 24\u2013August 24), c) hospitalization surveillance (August 25\u2013December 20), and d) severe/fatal case surveillance (December 21 onwards). The sentinel clinics, consisting of 3,000 pediatric clinics and 2,000 internal medical clinics, collected samples randomly, while the nonsentinel clinics collected samples depending on the surveillance stage. Local public health laboratories randomly selected these samples for neuraminidase (NA) surveillance from both sentinel and nonsentinel clinics. In this study, 4,307 clinical specimens, comprising both original samples (n = 440) and isolates (n = 3,867), were subjected to full or partial NA sequencing for detection of the H275Y mutation.
