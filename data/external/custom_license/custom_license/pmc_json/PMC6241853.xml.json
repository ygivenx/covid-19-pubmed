To verify the requisite topical application for an effect on pneumococcal carriage, we administered tetravalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) as a control (n=62). LAIV infection led to transiently increased pneumococcal acquisition at day 2 (60.0% vs. 40.3% by molecular methods in LAIV vs. control groups, respectively) 14. LAIV also increased Spn carriage load in the first 14 days following pneumococcal inoculation (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 14). We collected a series of nasal micro-biopsies and nasal lining fluid throughout the study to assess ongoing cellular and cytokine responses. Participants were grouped into those who did not become colonized following Spn challenge (carriage\u2013) and those who did (carriage+), as determined by classical microbiology (Fig. 1a). To investigate whether LAIV-induced immune responses were associated with a predisposition to pneumococcal carriage, we measured concentrations of 30 cytokines, and proteins including IL-1RA, in nasal lining fluid (Fig. 1b). At day 0, directly prior to Spn inoculation, LAIV significantly increased concentrations of twenty cytokines after multiple testing correction, including CXCL10 (IP-10), TNF, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-15 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, the control group did not show any significant increase in cytokine response at day 0. Following Spn inoculation, Spn carriage in the absence of LAIV was associated with increased concentration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) at day 2 and decreased concentrations of IL-1RA at day 9 post Spn inoculation compared to baseline, neither of which remained significant after multiple testing correction. No other cytokines, including IL-17A or CCL2, were significantly altered by carriage alone (Fig. 1b).",

In particular, IL-10 was significantly increased in LAIV-vaccinated subjects who did not acquire Spn following inoculation (5.8-fold increase), but not in those who became carriers following inoculation (2.0-fold increase). In contrast, CXCL10 was significantly increased in subjects who went on to become carriers (2.4-fold increase), but not in those who remained carriage-negative (1.5-fold increase). Moreover, subjects with increased concentrations of CXCL10 before inoculation displayed higher pneumococcal load following Spn inoculation (Fig. 1d). This suggests that differences in the response to influenza virus are associated with secondary susceptibility to Spn. To test whether this was specific for LAIV infection, we measured CXCL10 in nasal washes from an independent cohort in which a subset of subjects had asymptomatic viral upper respiratory tract infection the week before Spn inoculation, which did not progress to symptomatic infection. These comprised rhinovirus (n=12), coronavirus (n=5), respiratory syncytial virus (n=2) and parainfluenzavirus (n=1) 29. The predominant virus, rhinovirus, was recently shown to associate with increased pneumococcal acquisition and transmission 30. In these virus-infected subjects, CXCL10 concentration was increased (Supplementary Fig. 2), and baseline CXCL10 concentration correlated with increased pneumococcal load also in this second cohort (Fig. 1e). Unfortunately, sample sizes were too small to further investigate in depth the effect of infection by the different viruses, which are likely to have divergent effects. Although the correlation was modest in this validation cohort suggesting that other host and environmental factors are involved, this is the first time a biomarker predicting Spn load has been identified.",

            "text": "In murine models, neutrophil recruitment after onset of carriage contributes to control of the bacteria 15. We observed pre-existing high numbers of neutrophils in the human nasal lining and pneumococcal carriage did not lead to significant further recruitment of neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). To investigate whether luminal neutrophils were involved in the early control of carriage, we measured myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentrations, a marker for neutrophil degranulation 31, in nasal washes. Concentrations were increased (2.2-fold) at 2 days after challenge in control carriage+ but not carriage\u2013 individuals (Fig. 2a). This neutrophil activation was impaired in the LAIV group, who displayed high carriage load during early carriage and had increased acquisition compared to controls. Together, this suggests that neutrophil degranulation is important for the initial control of carriage. To investigate whether neutrophils were also impaired systemically following LAIV as reported during wild-type influenza infection 32, we isolated blood neutrophils before, and at three days after, LAIV administration from a subset of subjects. We confirmed that opsonophagocytic (OPK) killing of Spn by blood neutrophils was decreased following LAIV (Fig. 2b). This effect could be mimicked by the addition of TNF, but not CXCL10, to neutrophils from healthy donors in vitro, decreasing killing capacity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2c,d). Nanostring expression analysis of 594 genes revealed 10 differentially expressed genes in blood neutrophils 3 days post LAIV (Supplementary Table 2). Among those were MAP4K2 (3.2-fold increase), which acts on the TNF signal transduction pathway 33, and the co-inhibitory receptor TIGIT (3.6-fold increase, Fig. 2e). TIGIT expression levels also negatively correlated with neutrophil killing capacity (r=-0.73, Fig. 2f). TIGIT is an \u201cimmune checkpoint\u201d protein, which has been described to promote regulatory T cell (Treg cell) function 34, but its expression on neutrophils has not been previously appreciated. Incubation of whole blood with recombinant TNF increased TIGIT levels on neutrophil surface within 30 minutes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2g).",

Monocyte numbers increased as early as 2 days following Spn inoculation, peaked at 9 days (median 4.8x increase) and remained elevated 29 days post Spn inoculation. In contrast, there was no recruitment of CD3+ T cells to the nose (Supplementary Fig. 4b). LAIV infection prior to pneumococcal carriage impaired the recruitment of monocytes to the nose (Fig. 3a). Moreover, peak pneumococcal load associated with increased monocyte recruitment in the control group, but not the LAIV group (Fig. 3b,c). Indeed, for subjects in the control group with very low carriage densities, which were only detectable by molecular methods, no monocyte recruitment was observed (Supplementary Fig. 4c). This suggests that a minimum Spn load is required for sensing and monocyte recruitment and that LAIV infection interferes with this process. Although CCL2 (MCP-1) was not substantially induced following Spn carriage, its concentration correlated with numbers of monocytes at all timepoints (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Furthermore, stratification of individuals showed that those with increased CCL2 concentration at day 2 post Spn inoculation exhibit increased monocyte recruitment (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Concentrations of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF also correlated with numbers of monocytes at each time point, but stratification of individuals did not reveal a differential recruitment of monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). In a second, independent cohort that did not receive any vaccine, monocytes were increased at day 9 following Spn inoculation, which correlated with an increased CCL2 concentration in nasal fluid, validating these results (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5c).",

Relative cytokine production highly correlated between the two cell populations, suggesting that nasal monocytes/macrophages could be the source of these cytokines.

Moreover, TLR4 signalling was also enriched in this group. The pneumococcal protein pneumolysin is sensed by TLR4 36 and it is possible that the increased pneumococcal load following LAIV vaccination led to increased pneumolysin sensing. O-linked glycosylation of mucins, which are used by Spn as a carbohydrate source for growth 37, was also enriched in the LAIV carriage+ group (including genes ST3GAL4, GALNT7, GCNT3, B4GALT5). ST3GAL4 is a sialyl transferase and cleavage of sialic acids by the influenza neuraminidase has previously been shown to promote pneumococcal growth 38. This finding supports a LAIV-mediated effect on pneumococcal growth through alterations of host factors.

Numbers of monocytes correlated with the average fold change count in this module, suggesting that these genes reflect the infiltration of monocytes (Fig. 6b). To further investigate these monocytes, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on the Module M1 genes using list of genes from distinct monocyte subsets (Fig. 6c) 40. These genes were enriched for classical CD14+CD16\u2013 monocytes and not for other monocyte subsets.

Type I interferon has been shown to be required for the clearance of pneumococcal carriage in murine models 41 and these findings suggest that their activity in monocytes might be critical for this. CEMiTool also integrates co-expression analysis with protein-protein interaction data. Expression of CXCL6 and its receptor CXCR2 were identified as hubs in this module M1 (Fig. 6e and Supp html file 1). CXCR2 engagement has been shown to induce attachment of monocytes to the endothelial layer, initiating chemotaxis, which suggests this interaction could contribute to monocyte recruitment 42.

LAIV infection impaired these immune responses following carriage. LAIV is an attenuated influenza strain and wild-type influenza viruses might have even more pronounced effects on the host response to pneumococcus. Carriage in the absence of LAIV was associated with only limited inflammation, corroborating the view of Spn as a commensal bacterium that can asymptomatically colonize healthy adults 43. In contrast, robust pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were measured following LAIV at both the protein and gene expression level.

Key eligibility criteria included: capacity to give informed consent, no immunocompromised state or contact with susceptible individuals, no pneumococcal or influenza vaccine or infection in the last two years and not having taken part in EHPC studies in the past three years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of pneumococcal colonisation determined by the presence of pneumococcus in nasal wash samples (NW) at any time point post inoculation up to and including day 29, detected using classical microbiology or lytA qPCR as described 6,51,53. In this study, 130 volunteers were inoculated with pneumococcus, giving an 80% power to identify a 50% increase in carriage acquisition. Of 130 vaccinated volunteers, five were natural pneumococcal carriers (two in LAIV arm and three in control arm) and were excluded from further analysis. Another 8 subjects in the LAIV arm were excluded following a systematic LAIV dispensing error by a single practitioner, as recommended by the trial steering group. This resulted in a final 55 subjects analysed in the LAIV arm and 62 subjects in the control arm. Key secondary endpoints included the load of pneumococcal colonisation in NW at each time point following pneumococcal inoculation (days 2, 7, 9, 14, 22 and 29), detected using classical microbiology, the area under the curve of pneumococcal colonisation load following pneumococcal inoculation (days 2, 7, 9, 14, 22 and 29), detected using classical microbiology or by molecular methods (lytA), and the immunological mechanisms associated with altered susceptibility to pneumococcus following LAIV. The outcomes reported in this manuscript were a priori included in the study protocol.",
