This subfamily is nearly cosmopolitan in distribution, and its members occupy almost all aquatic habitats. The ecology of these birds, summarized in Figure 1, facilitates the maintenance and spread of avian influenza viruses. Although human influenza A isolates and the currently circulating H5N1 HPAI viruses typically infect the upper respiratory tract, the primary site of infection in ducks is the intestine.\n6\n Avian influenza viruses enter the environment when the host defecates or drools, and they then infect susceptible hosts as they feed and drink. Avian influenza virus replication has been observed in the respiratory tract,\n6\n but the contribution of this site to maintenance of infection in the population is unresolved. Specifically, fecal shedding of H4N7, H7N3, and H11N9 virions from experimentally infected mallard ducks persists longer and at higher titers than tracheal shedding.\n6\n When a large number of birds roost on a small pond (for example, in the staging/marshalling areas), as many as 1010 EID50\u2022g\u22121\u2022d\u22121 infectious virions are estimated to enter the environment in the fecal matter of each infected duck.\n6\n Further, avian influenza viruses are stable in water\n1\n, \n7\n and have been isolated from the surface of ponds containing a large number of waterfowl.\n8\n, \n9\n Although aerosol transmission cannot be dismissed, the larger number of positive cloacal than tracheal swabs, the high fecal virus titer, and the stability of the virions in water suggest that low\u2010pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses persist in duck populations through fecal\u2010oral transmission.\n1\n This mechanism could partially explain the higher prevalence of infection in surface\u2010feeding (dabbling) ducks than in diving ducks that typically feed in deeper water.\n10\n\n",

The prevalence of infection exhibits an annual cyclical pattern in both North American\n1\n, \n11\n and Eurasian\n12\n duck populations (Figure 1), peaking before and during the fall migration as a result of the influx of immunologically na\u00efve juveniles.\n1\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n13\n Experimentally infected white Pekin ducks have shed virus for more than 3 weeks after inoculation.\n3\n, \n14\n Coupled with limited morbidity and serum antibody response,\n3\n infected birds are likely to shed virus during the first few weeks of the fall migration, dispersing it along their numerous migration corridors. However, the prevalence of infection is much lower along the migration routes and at the wintering grounds than at the marshalling areas.\n9\n, \n12\n, \n15\n, \n16\n This disparity may reflect the development of immunity to circulating virus subtypes within the duck population or a decline in transmission because of population dispersal.\n13\n In general, prevalence of infection is higher at the wintering grounds and spring nesting sites in duck populations from Europe than in North American populations (Figure 1). The most likely explanation for this difference is random variation, since surveillance studies from multiple areas in North America and in Europe often obtain slightly different prevalence values in the duck populations. Many factors can affect prevalence including, but not limited to, the size of the duck population, sampling location, and time of collection. Thus, the few multi\u2010year studies that exist likely exemplify the variation that one would observe if additional sampling sites were included in the studies, and not the differences in geography between Europe and North America.\n16\n Prevalence is at its lowest during the spring migration but increases again after the breeding season, when the ducks have moved to the molting and staging areas.\n11\n, \n13\n, \n16\n It is not clear how the duck population acquires avian influenza viruses during the spring of every year. Infectious virions may persist through the winter in the frozen waters of the breeding areas and reinfect the ducks when they return in the spring.\n1\n, \n6\n Alternatively, the duck populations may carry the viruses throughout the entire migration. Year\u2010round prevalence in the ducks supports the latter, although persistence in the frozen habitats could play a role in the perpetuation of the viruses.\n10\n\n",

The general hypothesis is that these subtypes likely have the highest fitness, with replication rates balanced by a level of virulence that sufficiently increases transmission probability to the level where infection in the next cohort of birds is almost guaranteed. It is speculated that this could be largely influenced by the functional balance between HA binding affinity and NA enzymatic activity.\n17\n Although the H6 gene is of Eurasian origin and is widely distributed in North American ducks, genomic analysis of viruses suggests limited intercontinental exchange between Eurasia and the Americas.\n18\n Therefore, novel viral genotypes must arise via mutation and reassortment of the genomes in circulation within a specific geographic area. The marshalling areas provide such an opportunity by attracting populations of ducks from various breeding areas and migration corridors, with each population harboring a potentially different combination of subtypes.\n16\n Coinfection of ducks with two or more virus subtypes is common,\n19\n as is reassortment,\n14\n and emergent strains that are most virulent to gallinaceous poultry can have low pathogenicity in the duck hosts.\n20\n However, the role of ducks in the maintenance and spread of influenza viruses, and especially in the emergence of novel genotypes, appears to depend on their migratory behavior. Specifically, ducks that migrate annually are likely to spread influenza viruses along the migration routes, primarily by exposing the resident and domestic duck populations at the numerous stopover sites.\n10\n, \n16\n, \n21\n In contrast, domestic and resident ducks maintain the viruses in close proximity to other species and have been implicated in the spread of both LPAI and HPAI viruses to domestic poultry and terrestrial birds.\n20\n, \n22\n, \n23\n\n",

Viral antigens were found in the internal organs (nasal sinuses, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, lung, and air sacs) of the mallard duck embryos, but not in those of the Muscovy duck embryos.

Animals reinoculated 46 days later with the same virus strain had a marked antibody response, but virus could not be isolated from any of the organs. These results and the lack of a secondary immune response after inoculation with formalin\u2010inactivated virus suggested that the rapid immune response in re\u2010infected birds may restrict influenza infection to short time scales.\n3\n It is noteworthy that prior infection does not protect ducks against subsequent infection with other virus subtypes. For example, ducks infected with an H4N6 subtype are protected from reinfection with the same virus, but they shed virions for 8 days after challenge with an H11N3 isolate.\n27\n These data have applications in the field, where isolation of influenza virus from migratory waterfowl is infrequent during the winter, potentially indicating the existence of a significant level of immunity in wintering ducks acquired from previous influenza infections. Further illustration of this is seen from a study of wild waterfowl in Italy over six winter seasons, in which 17 of the 20 viruses isolated were of the H1N1 subtype, suggesting that the wintering ducks had some degree of immunity to the other subtypes of circulating influenza strains.\n28\n\n",

However, in 2007\u20132008, there were 14 human cases of HP H5N1 virus infection and 10 deaths (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2009_03_11/en/index.html). The difficulty of controlling H5N1 HPAI viruses in ducks by vaccination and the enormous task of vaccinating sufficient poultry to maintain \u201cherd immunity\u201d remain daunting obstacles.",

Influenza viruses have probably co\u2010evolved with ducks over millennia, establishing an equilibrium between hosts and parasites so that neither suffers a significant loss of biological fitness; the evidence being minimal signs of disease in the hosts and the annual isolation of common subtypes. The unanswered question is whether these migratory bird species are the reservoirs of the currently circulating H5N1 HPAI viruses. Until the emergence of the Asian H5N1 HPAI viruses, the available data indicated that each new outbreak of HP H5 or H7 virus died out or was stamped out and that subsequent HP strains emerged from the low\u2010pathogenic H5 and H7 virus reservoir.",

An unanswered question is whether the H5N1 HPAI viruses are being carried back to the duck breeding areas and are infecting the next generation. Extensive surveillance in the migratory pathways in Europe and Asia has provided no evidence of H5N1 HPAI viruses in the new generation of birds after the breeding season.",

It is in these relatively resistant species that the H5N1 HPAI viruses could be maintained. However, surveillance studies to date in these species have detected no H5N1 HPAI viruses in breeding or juvenile birds. Experimental studies show that some mallard ducks continue to shed virus for up to 17 days, allowing the development of humoral immunity and subsequent selection of antigenic variants within the same bird.\n23\n If this occurs, it could be argued that a limited number of ducks would be sufficient to maintain the virus in nature. Continued surveillance is needed to determine whether H5N1 HPAI viruses are maintained in nature by a small number of naturally resistant ducks that are long\u2010term virus shedders.",

More than 6\u00b76 million birds migrate from Eastern Asia to Alaska yearly (alaska.usgs.gov/science/biology/avian_influenza/migrants_tables.html). Despite intense surveillance in Alaska, no H5N1 HPAI viruses have been detected to date, and influenza viruses of Eurasian lineage are introduced into the Americas only rarely.\n18\n The major spreaders of influenza in domestic poultry are humans. As described by Chen et al. (2006), from the molecular epidemiology data, transmission of H5N1 influenza in domestic poultry is perpetuated largely through movement of poultry and poultry products rather than continued reintroduction of viruses from migrating birds.\n42\n\n",

Prospective surveillance continued to isolate H5N1 HPAI viruses from apparently healthy ducks, geese, and chickens in Southeast Asian poultry markets during 2004\u20132006. Naturally resistant ducks might not be expected to show disease signs, but the absence of morbidity in highly susceptible geese and chickens is surprising. The widespread use of vaccine in chickens may explain this observation, but vaccine has been used less in geese and ducks. An alternative possibility is that the susceptible poultry had cross immunity as the result of exposure to co\u2010circulating influenza viruses. Experimental studies have demonstrated that chickens previously infected with H9N2 virus and then inoculated with H5N1 HPAI virus become infected and shed virus but do not show disease signs.\n51\n The continuing co\u2010circulation of multiple subtypes of LPAI viruses in domestic poultry could explain why a small percentage of susceptible domestic species can appear healthy while shedding transmissible levels of H5N1 HPAI virus. To provide answers to these unresolved questions about the role of domestic species, it will be necessary to establish long\u2010term prospective surveillance in domestic poultry in the hypothetical \u201cepicenter zones,\u201d including China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, and Nigeria.
