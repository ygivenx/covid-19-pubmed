Immunosenescence, defined as age-related deterioration of both innate and adaptive immunity, seems to impair elderly individuals to elicit effective immune responses against invading pathogens, at least partly explaining their vulnerability to LRTI (Krone et al., 2014).",

Typically, this pathogen populates the upper respiratory tract (URT) asymptomatically in coherence with a vast and diverse community of other potential pathogenic and commensal bacteria, fungi and viruses. In general, during health, the so-called microbiome is presumed to be at an equilibrium, providing beneficial functions to the host, such as pathogen resistance (Cho and Blaser, 2012). However, acquisition of new bacterial or viral pathogens, environmental factors or immunological perturbations can potentially disrupt the equilibrium, leading to dysbiosis, pathogen overgrowth and dissemination, resulting in symptomatic infections like pneumonia (Bogaert et al., 2011; Dethlefsen et al., 2007).",

Also, different microbial niches are studied (Sakwinska et al., 2014) and research is focused on specific risk groups like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-infected patients (Iwai et al., 2012) or patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (Chaban et al., 2013; Leung et al., 2013). Nevertheless, microbiota studies in chronic respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma suggests an important role for bacterial communities, both commensals and potential pathogens, in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases (Hansel et al., 2013; Molyneaux et al., 2013).",

Therefore, we investigated the oropharyngeal microbiome in a large group of elderly with pneumonia (n=100) using 16S-based sequencing and compared this with healthy community-dwelling controls (n=91). To validate our findings and to explore the effect of age, we sought to replicate our results in a cohort of young adult pneumonia patients (n=27) and healthy controls (n=187).",

This could, for example, be explained by inflammation-induced acidification of the local environment of the oropharyngeal niche (Lardner, 2001), which has been related to a reduction of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum and outgrowth of acidophilic species like lactobacilli (Duncan et al., 2009).

Adjacent to the dendrogram branch ends, viral data and information on disease severity are visualized and stacked bar charts show the relative abundance of the 15 highest ranked OTUs. Color coding: presence of influenza virus and non-influenza virus is shown in purple and orange respectively; dark purple/orange, virus present in moderate-high amount (CT-value <35 cycles); moderate light purple/orange, virus present in low amount (CT-value 35\u201345 cycles); light purple/orange, viral qPCR performed and tested negative (CT-value >45 cycles); white, no viral qPCR performed. Clusters (defined as more than four samples; bright) are designated by dotted gray lines originating from the center of the dendrogram. Groups of samples comprising less than four samples are shown opaque. Three clusters were significantly associated with health; these clusters showed predominance of Prevotella melaninogenica (IIIa and IIIb) and Leptotrichia (IIIb) or showed a balanced microbial community (VIII). Clusters that were correlated with disease showed high relative abundance of either lactobacilli (IV), Rothia (Va) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (VII). Cluster IV was most strongly associated with the presence of influenza virus (50%). Five clusters showed no association with either health or disease, these clusters showed high relative abundance of Neisseria (Ia and Ib), Actinomyces (II), Gemellales (VI) or Rothia (Vb). Per cluster, the mean relative abundance of the 15 highest ranked oropharyngeal OTUs and the residual bacteria separated by phylum is given in circle graphs that were size-scaled according to the number of individuals within each cluster.

On the basis of random forest analysis, seven variables (Prevotella melaninogenica OTU rank 5, Leptotrichia, Streptococcus OTU rank 8, Gemellales, Parascardovia, Prevotella OTU rank 20 and Veillonella dispar) were found to be most important in the discrimination between healthy controls and pneumonia patients. Measures of impurity (Gini- and information indices) were used to identify the most discriminative OTUs based on the random forest analysis. Subsequently, these OTUs were used to construct a decision tree model, which was based on the relative abundance of Prevotella melaninogenica, Leptotrichia, Streptococcus, Gemellales and Parascardovia. From the root of the tree, each branch represents a division of the initial group based on the relative abundance (shown in small font) of an OTU. The numbers (regular font size) neighboring the branches depict the number of individuals before each split. Adjacent to the branch ends are circle graphs illustrating the number of individuals (represented by the surface of the circles, colored by the study group they originate from) that are stratified by the prior split. Light green, healthy adults; dark green, healthy elderly; light red, adult pneumonia and dark red, elderly pneumonia. The numbers below the graphs represent the exact proportions. The combined presence and abundance of Prevotella and Leptotrichia appears to be the strongest determinant for respiratory health.",
