            "text": "The importance of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a pneumonia pathogen is beyond question. S. pneumoniae is regarded as the single biggest cause of community-acquired pneumonia across all age groups and geographic regions of the world. However, diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia in individual patients can be difficult, mainly due to the inability to obtain specimens from the site of infection and the failure of diagnostic tests to distinguish colonization from infection. Regardless of these shortcomings, newer diagnostics have enhanced understanding of the role of S. pneumoniae in the etiology of pneumonia in several ways. First, they have reinforced the importance of S. pneumoniae as the most commonly identified cause of pneumonia. For example, the latest generation pneumococcal urinary antigen lateral flow tests have improved the ability to diagnose pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Second, measurement of pneumococcal load provides insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia and may be helpful in distinguishing colonization from infection. In particular, preliminary data indicates that quantitative PCR testing of upper respiratory tract specimens may have diagnostic utility. Third, newer diagnostics have increased recognition that pneumococcus is often present with other potential pathogens. These observations reinforce the concept that infection with multiple pathogens may be important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. There is a pressing need for completely new approaches to pneumonia diagnostics, particularly approaches that can distinguish colonising from infecting microorganisms, that can distinguish recent from past infection, that account for host responsiveness, and can utilise samples that are easy to obtain.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of human bocavirus (hBoV), human rhinovirus (hRV), polyomavirus-WU (WUPyV) and -KI (KIPyV) and human coronaviruses (CoV)-OC43, -NL63 and -HKU1 among children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and probe the role of pneumococcal co-infection in HIV-infected and -uninfected children. Multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was undertaken on archived nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from a cohort of 39836 children randomized to receive 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) or placebo when hospitalized for LRTI. At least one of the newly-studied viruses was identified in 53% (275/518) and 54% (509/943) of LRTI-episodes in HIV-infected and -uninfected children, respectively. The newly-studied viruses were detected at high frequency in association with other respiratory viruses (22.8% in HIV-infected and 28.5% in HIV-uninfected children). Fully PCV9-vaccinated HIV-uninfected children had a lower incidence of hospitalization for KIPyV (80.0%; 95%CI: 41.4, 93.2), WUPyV (48.5%; 95%CI: 9.1, 70.8) and overall coronaviruses (60.0%; 95%CI: 9.1, 82.4). There was, however, no difference in incidence of hBoV and hRV between PCV9 and placebo recipients among HIV-uninfected children. Also, no differences in incidence of pneumonia hospitalization were observed between PCV9 and placebo recipients among HIV-infected children. We established a high prevalence of the newly studied viruses in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children hospitalized for LRTI. Using a PCV-probe approach, we established that pneumonia associated with polyomaviruses and coronaviruses are probably precipitated by pneumococcal co-infection and preventable by PCV immunization.",

Herein we describe previously unrecognized cardiac microlesions formed within the myocardium during experimental Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice and rhesus macaques. In mice, microlesion formation was positively correlated with bacterial burden in the blood and serum levels of troponin, a marker for cardiac damage. Microlesions were accompanied by progressive changes in cardiac electrophysiology, as measured by limb-lead ECG, which indicated the development of aberrant contractility. Microlesions increased in number and size during IPD, were confined to the heart, and lacked infiltrating immune cells. Bacterial translocation across the cardiac vasculature into heart tissue required the pneumococcal adhesin CbpA and the host-ligands laminin receptor and platelet activating factor receptor. Once in the myocardium, pneumococci remained extracellular. The pore forming toxin pneumolysin was present at sites of cell death and was determined to be required for microlesion formation. Immunization with a fusion construct of CbpA peptides and a pneumolysin toxoid protected against microlesion formation. We conclude that cardiac microlesions form during IPD and contribute towards aberrant cardiac electrophysiology. Because microlesions were also observed in non-human primates, they help to explain the high incidence of adverse cardiac events seen in humans with IPD.",

It causes CAP in older adults and can lead to serious life threatening secondary multidrug resistant Gram negative infection, even in older adults. A 66 y old male patient, known diabetic, hypertensive, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presented with fever, confusion, pleuritic chest pain, respiratory distress with cough and blood-tinged expectoration. On examination: tachypnoea, right basal creps+, CURB 65 score 4. Admitted for investigation and treatment. X-ray: right lower pneumonia, total leukocyte count (TLC) 16500 (Neutrophil 92%), C-reactive protein (CRP) 116. Considering a case of CAP, emperic antibiotic started inj Pip-tazo4.5 gm IV three times daily (TDS) +Azithromycin 500mg daily, after collecting sputum and blood culture. Patient needed mechanical ventilation on day 2 for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia. Sputum Gram stain: plenty pus cells, occasional epithelial cells and fair number of gram positive encapsulated diplococci likely pneumococci. Culture-mixed growth. Pneumococcal pneumonia likely. Treatment continued. Re-onset of fever on day 6 with tachypnea and hypoxia. Reintubated, increasing TLC (19000), endotracheal (ET) secretion+, repeat X-ray found new opacity in left lower lung field. Procalcitonin 5, CRP 195. Considering case of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), antibiotic escalation done to Meropenem at 1gm Intra-venous (IV) TDS, after collecting ET suction and blood for culture. Culture grew Acinetobacter baumannii, sensitive only to colistin/poly B. Colistin added with the existing regime 9 million units (MU) loading, followed by 2MU TDS according to creatinine clearance, cosidering synergistic effect. Patient became afebrile within the next 48 hours, followed by successful weaning off ventilator. Antibiotic therapy continued for a total of 7 days. Patient was successfully discharged on day 16 with complete microbiological clearance. Being a life threatening organism itself, this pathogen may also help other resistant Gram negative pathogens to be established in a previously infected host. So prevention of primary infection can avoid serious secondary infection in older adult.",

During infection, ClpL is highly expressed to refold stress-induced denatured proteins at least some of which are important for adherence. However, the mechanism by which ClpL modulates pneumococcal virulence is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how ClpL inhibits the adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (D39) to A549 human lung cells. Using microarray and Western blot analyses, ClpL was found to induce and activate small GTPases (Rap1, Rac1, Cdc42, and Rho) and decrease the ratio of cofilin:p-cofilin, which regulates actin dynamics. Thus, actin re-organization and cytoskeleton re-arrangement were increased in clpL mutant (HYK304) infected cells compared to D39 wild type infected cells. Filament formation was also higher in HYK304 infected cells than D39 wild type infected cells. Rap1- and Rac1-deficient cells showed impaired filament formation and decreased S. pneumoniae adherence to A549 cells. These results demonstrate a novel role of ClpL in pneumococcal resistance to adherence to host cells during infection, and provide insight into further understanding the interactions between hosts and pathogens.",
