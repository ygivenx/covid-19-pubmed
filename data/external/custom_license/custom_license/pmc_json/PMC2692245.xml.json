Therapeutic treatment with 15 mg kg-1 (an achievable dose in humans) of IgG1 at 24h post-inoculation also protected 80-100% of the mice challenged with either H5-VN04 or H5-HK97 virus (Fig. 2c-d). Mice treated at later times (48 or 72h post-inoculation) with H5-VN04 showed similar or higher levels of protection (Fig. 2e-f).

The impact of antibody therapy on systemic infection was dramatically demonstrated by \u2265 1000-fold suppression of virus spread to the spleen, even when given 72 hpi (Supplementary Fig. 5).

We used H5 activated by cleavage of the single chain precursor, HA0, into two polypeptides, HA1 and HA2. Cleavage leads to the partial burial of the \u201cfusion peptide\u201d (the first ~21 residues of each HA2) into the stem19,21, which also contributes to the formation of each of three hydrophobic \u201cpockets\u201d located below the large trimeric receptor-binding head. In the complex, one F10 nAb binds into each pocket, burying ~1500 \u00c52 of protein surface. Only the heavy chain (VH) participates directly in binding, utilizing all three of its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The light chain (VL) points out into solution, and makes only non-specific contacts with the distal end of the oligosaccharide of glycosylated residue Asn331 from a neighboring monomer. The epitope on H5 encompasses the entire pocket, which is formed by the HA2 fusion peptide, flanked by elements of HA1 on one side and helix \u03b1A of HA2 on the other.",

Phe55 lies across a flat hydrophobic surface formed by the main-chain of the fusion peptide, residues 182-212; it also makes favorable orthogonal aromatic interactions23 with the side-chains of Trp212 at the back of the pocket, and His181 at the front (subscripts 1 or 2 refer to HA1 or HA2, and the numbering scheme follows the structure of H3 (pdb:2hmg)17,24). The Met54 sulfur makes II-aromatic interactions25 with the Trp212 ring, hydrophobic interactions with Ile452 from helix \u03b1A, an a H-bond between Met54 C=O and the His381 side-chain; s. (ii) Tyr102 from CDR-H3 extends from the apex of the H3 loop, to a location only ~3 \u00c5 from Phe55, and complements CDR-H2 by cementing together the fusion peptide (via a main-chain H-bond to Asp192) and the \u03b1A helix of HA2 (by intercalating between Thr412 and Ile452). A large hydrophobic residue at the neighboring position 103 supports the side-chain conformation of Tyr102; and (iii) the CDR-H1 loop is characterized by small hydrophobic/polar side-chains (notably Val27, Thr 28 and Ser31) such that CDR-H1 fits snugly beneath the HA head while packing against helix \u03b1A.

Thus, F10 may stabilize the fusion peptide of more than one subunit. One framework (FR3) residue, Gln74, appears to be especially important in stabilizing the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 loop conformations, by forming H-bonds to the main chain C=O groups of Pro53 and Met54, as well as the side-chain of Ser30.

Mutations to other surfaces of the \u03b1A helix either have no effect (typically exposed residues) or lead to increased nAb binding, perhaps by subtly increasing the flexibility of the epitope (Fig. 4d).

In addition, free energy calculations26 point to dominant binding contributions (~70% of the total favorable free energy) of the three conserved residues in the VH segment (Fig. 5b). In CDR-H2 derived from germline V1-69, position 55 is always Phe, and position 54 is always hydrophobic (M/I/L/V). In our nAbs, CDR-H3 always has a Tyr predicted to lie at the tip of the CDR3 loop (conserved at the 6th position). The conformation and sequence of the CDR1 loop does not seem to be critical, since the other Abs we isolated do not contain the somatic mutation (Gly26=>Glu) found in F10, and are predicted to have canonical structures. The sixth VH gene we isolated is derived from the germline gene, VH1-2; its H2 loop has the same length as VH1-69, but by virtue of a change from Ala to Arg at position 7222 it is predicted to adopt a distinct conformation (\u201ctype 3\u201d), which presents loop residues 3 and 4 to the antigen (rather than residues 4 and 5 in type 2 loops). The specific somatic mutation at position 4, from Asn to Met, presumably promotes H5 binding. It is not possible to predict the structure of the larger H3 loop, but a tyrosine is located at the center of the loop that may play an analogous role to that in VH1-69.",

Our data point to this event occurring at an early step in the infectious process, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the nAbs act at a later stage, given the close packing of molecules on the surface of the mature virion which might restrict early access to the epitope.

These differences arise from group-specific differences in the location of buried residues, notably histidines (H1112 is unique to Group 1; H171 is unique to Group 2) that have been proposed to be the \u201ctriggers\u201d for pH-induced conformational changes29. The differences cause the side-chain of Trp212 to turn through 90\u00b0 in Group 2 subtypes, eliminating favorable binding to Phe55 from our nAb panel. In addition, four out of six Group 2 subtypes are glycosylated at position 381, at the periphery of the F10 epitope; our modeling studies predict steric clashes with the CDR-H1 loop (data not shown). These structural differences rationalize the observed lack of binding/neutralization of Group 2 HA subtypes and viruses.",

It is straightforward to model the locations of the F10 epitope residues in this model of the fusogenic state (see Supplementary Note 1). All 8 epitope residues, which were fully exposed in the neutral pH structure, become either part of the new hydrophobic bundle core (Thr412, Ile452, Val522 and Ile562), or they make networks of H-bonds with the C-terminal arms and other elements that stabilize the new bundle (Lys 382, Gln422, Thr492, Asn532). The requirement for adopting two entirely different conformations, each with a distinct hydrophobic core and H-bonding network may place powerful evolutionary constraints on the sequence of the helix, as evidenced by the almost complete lack of genetic drift within helix \u03b1A among the 16 HA subtypes.",

In contrast, we failed to identify any viruses resistant to any of our 3 IgG1s (D8, F10, or A66).

Moreover, C179 was shown to block membrane fusion rather than cell attachment and to protect mice against viral challenge41, although a detailed mechanism was not reported. We compared the activities of C179 and F10 and found that both showed similar binding towards H5. We also found that F10 efficiently competed with C179 for binding to H5, but not vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 9). Furthermore, the point mutant V522E abrogated binding to both Abs, while T3181K only affected C179 binding.

As noted above, we repeatedly isolated nAbs that utilize the same VH germline gene (IGHV1-69 or \u201cVH1-69\u201d). Huang et al.43 have pointed out that this is the only VH gene that consistently encodes 2 hydrophobic residues at the tip of its CDR-H2 loop; indeed, it is the only germline gene to encode a Phe at this position, which makes several critical interactions with H5. Moreover, the \u201ctype 2\u201d H2 loop, which is long and compact, is only predicted to occur in 4 out of the ~50 human germline genes. These factors may explain at least in part the remarkable ability of nAbs derived from this germline gene to cross-react with viral epitopes: their unusual ability to bind to conserved hydrophobic pockets. Such pockets are likely to have an important function and for this reason they are often cryptic in the unactivated state of the antigen. For example, VH1-69 is the predominant gene utilized by a group of CD4-induced (\u201cCD4i\u201d) nAbs raised against the HIV-1 surface glycoprotein, gp120, where the \u201cpocket\u201d is part of a conserved co-receptor binding site that is only exposed transiently upon binding to its primary receptor, CD443. Similarly, an antibody raised against the HIV gp41 trimeric \u201cinner-core\u201d fusion protein intermediate utilizes the hydrophobic tip of its VH1-69 CDR-H2 loop to insert into a conserved hydrophobic pocket that blocks further assembly to the fusion-competent 6-helix structure44. In vivo, B cells carrying the VH1-69 gene are the primary mediators of innate defense against HCV infection, generating antibodies against its membrane fusion glycoprotein, E245, although the epitope and mode of action have not been determined. Notably, as we found in the current study, VH1-69 is not the only germline that is suitable for achieving neutralization in a similar manner. Another recent example is a nAb against Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, KZ52, which uses the VH3-21 germline46. However, their common ability to lock viral envelope proteins into a non-fusogenic conformation offers support for the possibility of a general strategy for broad-spectrum and/or potent viral neutralization.",

Analysis of their data (Supplementary Note 3) indicates that the antibodies are also derived from the VH1-69 germline gene, and share other key characteristics, including the Met-Phe pair in CDR-H2 and a tyrosine at the tip of CDR-H3. Thus it would appear, at least in this case, that our non-immune (H5-naive) donor library approach generated antibodies with characteristics very similar to those found using immunized-donor-based phage-display libraries derived from H5N1 survivors.",

Rather, we hypothesize that an immunodominant Ab response to the highly-exposed globular head may overwhelm the Ab response to the F10-epitope, although it remains possible that other immune exclusion mechanism(s) may preclude natural Ab responses against the F10 epitope. It is not surprising that many viruses are highly adept at keeping their most critical (and conserved) determinants of pathogenesis cryptic, in which case subunit-based vaccines, utilizing properly presented fragments of F10 or F10-like epitopes, may offer distinct advantages over whole-virus-based approaches for the induction of broad spectrum nAbs in vivo49,50.",

Our initial experiments suggest that this region is recalcitrant to the generation of escape mutants. The prospects for their use for passive immunotherapy would therefore seem to be excellent, either alone or in combination with small molecule inhibitors (Supplementary Note 6). Finally, our structural work pinpoints the reasons why Group 2 HAs do not bind the nAbs described here: despite surface sequence similarities, they form a structurally distinct group, but one that is also highly conserved and therefore may be amenable to a similar panning discovery approach.",
