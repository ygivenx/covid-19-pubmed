Case-patients were children admitted for an acute RTI (mostly bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, and laryngotracheobronchitis) who had a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) collected as part of investigation of their illness. A specific questionnaire was completed at admission by a research nurse in the presence of the parents. At the end of hospitalization, charts of the children were reviewed to collect clinical and laboratory data. Eligible controls were children hospitalized during the same period for any elective surgery (ear, nose, and throat surgeries in 71% of the cases). These children had no concomitant respiratory symptoms or fever at admission. The study nurse obtained a signed consent from parents and an NPA was obtained during surgery. The original studies were reviewed and approved by the ethics committees of all participating healthcare centers.",

A duplex HBoV PCR (TaqMan assay) was used to amplify conserved regions of NP-1 and NS-1 genes as described (14), except that the NS-1 forward primer was replaced with primer 5\u2032-TAG TTG TTT GGT GGG ARG A-3\u2032. Probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (TET) at the 5\u2032 end and with a quencher at the 3\u2032 end. Amplicons were 81 bp (NP-1) and 74 bp (NS-1), respectively. Duplex amplification was conducted by using 1 \u00b5mol/L NS-1 forward primer and 0.4 \u00b5mol/L NS-1 reverse primer and the 2 NP-1 primers. Taqman probes were used at concentrations of 0.1 mmol/L for the NP-1 gene and 0.2 mmol/L for the NS-1 gene (14). The amplification master mixture consisted of 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 3.33 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mmol/L of each of the 4 deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 50 mmol/L KCl, 0.625 U Promega Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher Scientific, Markham, Ontario, Canada) combined with TaqStart antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and 3 \u03bcL DNA in a final volume of 25 \u03bcL. PCR amplification (180 s at 94\u00b0C and 45 cycles for 10 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 58\u00b0C, and 30 s at 72\u00b0C) was performed in a Smart Cycler thermal cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A PCR extension step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C was performed at the end of the cycling protocol. An HBoV infection was defined by a positive PCR result for NP-1 and NS-1. The duplex assay had a sensitivity of 10 genome copies for NP-1 and NS-1 gene targets on the basis of quantification analysis of positive control plasmids.",

Bastien et al. (5) reported an overall rate of infection of 1.5% in respiratory samples negative for other viruses, with no differences between age groups. Maggi et al. (16) reported only 1 HBoV-positive sample from an adult with lymphoma in 62 bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs). These investigators also tested 22 nasal swabs from adults with persistent asthma symptoms and found no samples positive for HBoV. Fry et al. (10) identified HBoV DNA in 1% of adults >20 years of age hospitalized with pneumonia in Thailand. Kupfer et al. (27) described a case of HBoV infection associated with severe atypical pneumonia in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who was also infected with cytomegalovirus in a BAL sample. We found 1 case of HBoV infection in an adult, which represented 0.8% of the tested population.

(16) did not detect HBoV DNA in nasal swabs from 51 asymptomatic children (including 30 healthy infants with a mean age of 6 months and 21 preadolescent healthy children with a mean age of 12.8 years). However, these studies analyzed nasal swabs instead of NPA or BAL samples for HBoV detection, which may result in lower rates of viral detection, as shown in symptomatic persons. Allander et al. (2) did not detect HBoV in any of 64 asymptomatic children (median age 4.1 years, range 5 months to 14 years) but used nasal swabs in asymptomatic patients and NPA samples in symptomatic patients. Furthermore, their control group was also older than our population (mean 18.6 months, median 18 months). Kesebir et al. (12) did not detect any HBoV DNA in nasal washes from 96 asymptomatic children <2 years of age seen at a clinic compared with 22 (5.2%) of 425 various samples from symptomatic children sent to a hospital clinical laboratory. None of the previous studies used a control group consisting of children matched for age and week of admission and analyzed the same type of respiratory samples for cases and controls.",

Also, sample preparation and PCR amplification were performed in separate laboratory areas following the stringent quality control program of our institution. Thus, it is unlikely that our positive results were due to PCR cross-contamination. Our method was also very sensitive (detection limit = 10 genome copies), which probably enabled an increased infection rate compared with previous reports. We cannot exclude the possibility that prior RTIs (in the few weeks preceding sampling) occurred in our asymptomatic children hospitalized for an elective surgery or that HBoV could establish a prolonged infection in children compared with other respiratory viruses. However, the 3\u00d7 higher detection rate in controls than in symptomatic children make these explanations unlikely. We did not quantify HBoV DNA load in samples from our study, which could have been different between asymptomatic and symptomatic children. Nevertheless, we detected hRSV, hMPV, and influenza virus RNA in <1% of the same NPA samples from those asymptomatic children compared with a rate of 43% for HBoV DNA (25). At the very least, our results should raise concerns about the pathogenic role of HBoV in children.",

This result is consistent with findings of other groups from North America and Europe during 2002\u20132004 and highlights the fact that HBoV lineages do not appear to be geographically clustered (1,6,9,12). The seasonality of HBoV infection is still a matter of debate, but it seems to involve primarily the colder months of the year (9,20,21). However, most studies, including ours, were performed during the typical respiratory virus season, which may have introduced a bias. Additional studies are needed to address the prevalence of HBoV outside the respiratory virus season and its role in nonrespiratory syndromes. Moreover, the possibility that this virus might be transmitted and isolated in the respiratory tract, but could cause viremia and other clinical syndromes such as gastroenteritis, should be investigated. Vicente et al. analyzed 527 stool samples from children with gastroenteritis and no respiratory symptoms and found a positivity rate of 9.1% for HBoV (with a co-infection rate of 58%) (22).",
