But for the scientific community there were signs of progress and hope. Researchers continued to interrogate nature and produce intriguing results, ranging from the genetic sequence of the rat to the surprise discovery of a previously unknown and diminutive species of humankind. And scientists exasperated by the reluctance of policy-makers to take research seriously could draw some comfort, at least, from Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. In the following pages, Nature highlights some of the events that excited the world of science over the past 12 months.",

Given no constraints, we asked, what would you wish for in 2005? What follows is a sample of the responses our reporters got from researchers and policy-makers across all fields of study, along with summaries of the events that framed these aspirations. From the development of effective therapies against HIV and malaria, to the detection of life elsewhere in the Universe, to the ability to do research without the intrusion of politics or bureaucracy, the community's wish list provides an insightful \u2014 and refreshingly optimistic \u2014 glimpse into the future.",

Activists have now been portrayed as terrorists by some sections of the media, and their often militant approach has been exposed by undercover journalists. And in November, Oxford won a court injunction barring protestors from the immediate vicinity of the proposed site for its animal house. Stein and Aziz say that the threats they receive have now almost petered out.",

Stein and his brother Rick, a famous chef in Britain, co-hosted the event. They found themselves harassed by activists dressed in animal suits shouting that John was a \u201cmonkey torturer\u201d. But when police arrived, says John, they ended up having to protect the protestors from members of the public, rather than the Stein brothers from the protestors.

Equally importantly, it would also involve the resumption of building work on Oxford's animal facility, which has been on hold since July. The university insists a new contractor will be found.
