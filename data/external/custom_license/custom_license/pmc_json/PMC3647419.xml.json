Despite initial supportive therapy at the referring veterinarian, clinical signs worsened; at UC Davis, the dog was treated for hypovolemic shock. Because of suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation and a poor overall prognosis, the owner elected to have the dog euthanized and granted permission for routine necropsy, which was performed at the Anatomic Pathology Service of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. The clinical and postmortem workups for infectious causes in this case included negative test results for infectious causes of enteric disease, such as canine parvovirus, canine enteric coronavirus, Salmonella spp., canine distemper virus, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A gene, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp. Histologic results showed extensive fibrinoid vascular necrosis, thrombosis, and hemorrhage throughout the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, as well as granulomatous lymphadentitis of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Special stains of histologic specimens revealed no detectable bacteria or other infectious agents. Liver tissue samples were collected, stored in whirl-pack bags, and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing.",

The DogCV-UCD1 capsid showed <30% amino acid identity to known circovirus capsids. Sequence alignment of the putative Rep protein of DogCV-UCD1 with those of known species in the genus Circovirus identified several highly conserved amino acid motifs, including WWDGY, DDFYGW, and DRYP. Motifs associated with rolling circle replication (FTLNN, TPHLQG, and CSK) and the dNTP binding (GXGKS) were also identified. The N terminal region of the Cap protein was highly basic and arginine-rich, as is typical for circoviruses. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete Rep protein of DogCV strains and all known circoviruses was performed, with chicken anemia virus (genus Gyrovirus) as the outgroup (Figure 1, panel B). The phylogenetic tree showed that DogCV strains grouped with PCV1 and PCV2, forming a distinct clade of mammalian circovirus, whereas circoviruses affecting birds clustered separately.",

PCV2 enhances viral (e.g., porcine parvovirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus), bacterial, protozoal, metazoal, and fungal infections in pigs (6). Among the dogs with diarrhea in our study, most (68%) of those positive for DogCV had co-infection with >1 enteric pathogens. Also, for the small set of cases in which we identified virus in situ, 1 dog was co-infected with a canine bocavirus and 1 with Babesia conradae. The role of co-infection in the pathogenesis of disease in these cases is unclear.",
