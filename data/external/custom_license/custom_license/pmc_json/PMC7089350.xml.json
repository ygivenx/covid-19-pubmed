The effect of rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions has become even more pronounced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014) found that, in 2010, global emissions of carbon dioxide were twice that of 1970. Greenhouse gas emissions increase the ambient temperature as they absorb and release radiation in the thermal infrared range. Previous literature has documented the fact that summers have become increasingly hot due to this phenomenon. For example, Habeeb et al. (2015) found that the frequency and intensity of heat waves increased significantly between 1961 and 2010 across 50 US cities.",

Those that have include Seiver (1985, 1989), Roenneberg and Aschoff (1990), Lam and Miron (1991, 1996), and Barreca et al. (2018). They used relatively old data,1 and found a negative relationship between temperature and birth rate; that is, high temperatures reduce the number of births. Barreca et al. (2018), the most recent of the studies, examined data obtained between 1931 and 2010 and found that an additional day with a mean temperature of 80 \u00b0F or higher decreased birth rates 8, 9, and 10 months later, but increased them 11\u201323 months later; the net effect of these findings is equal to a decrease in birth rate of 0.33%. The study also found that an additional day with a temperature of 80 \u00b0F or higher increased the current month\u2019s birth rate and decreased that of the following month.2,3 However, they found no significant impact from cold temperatures.",

            "text": "Using data from South Korea, this study examines the effect of temperature on birth rate and birth outcomes. It complements the existing literature as follows. First, this study analyzes relatively recent data, obtained between 2009 and 2013. Presenting results based on recent data can be a valuable addition to the literature because populations adapt to extreme weather; thus, a prediction of the effect of future temperature is likely to be more reliable when it is based on recent data. Second, when estimating the temperature effect, this study compares birth rate and birth outcomes within the same city/month over time. This prevents the possibility of bias when comparing different months in the same city or different cities within the same month. Thus, the analysis is a cohort analysis. According to Hsiang (2016), this is a strengthening of the unit homogeneity assumption because different cohorts within the same unit are comparable. Since the data does not span a long period, the same city/month can be assumed to be homogeneous over time. Third, this study focuses on the influence of summer heat because rising temperatures impact people. Therefore, this study employs daily maximum temperatures rather than the daily average temperatures used in prior studies, because average temperatures may not accurately reflect the extent of the summer heat, as experienced by people.",

This result is robust to various specifications and samples. This study also found that the impact of the temperature bin did not vary according to the mother\u2019s characteristics, including education and age. That is, high temperature has no differential effect on mothers of different backgrounds. Finally, we found no significant temperature effect on birth outcomes, but we cannot rule out that children born 9 months after summer heat are a selected (healthy) group.",

Avoidance or lack of pregnancy because of hot weather decreases the number of newborns 9 months after a heat exposure event.4 Resuming efforts to become pregnant immediately thereafter increases the number of newborns 10 months after the heat exposure event (delayed pregnancy). If the pregnancy period is shortened, the number of newborns in the expected month will decrease. For example, if the pregnancy period is shortened by 1 month, babies that were expected to be born 1 month later will be born in this month. In this case, this month will see an increase in the number of newborns, and the next month will see a decrease.5",

Temp is a variable representing the daily maximum temperature of each month and consists of the following six categories: < 22 \u00b0C, 22\u201324 \u00b0C, 24\u201326 \u00b0C, 26\u201328 \u00b0C, 30\u201332 \u00b0C, and \u2265 32 \u00b0C. Using categorical variables for temperature is now standard across the literature (Dell et al. 2014). For example, \u2265 32 \u00b0C indicates the number of days in a month for which the daily maximum temperature is equal to or greater than 32 \u00b0C. The superscript 6 of the Temp variable represents \u2265 32 \u00b0C, and 1 represents < 22 \u00b0C. The bin of 28\u201330 \u00b0C is excluded from the equation and is used as a comparison category.10 If no bin is excluded, the coefficients for each temperature bin indicate the value of the dependent variable, and, therefore, one should compare the coefficients to examine how a temperature bin affects the birth rate relative to another temperature bin. Excluding a bin exempts us from doing so. This study includes the temperature of the current month and past temperatures from up to 12 months prior in the equation. If, for example, Temp6ct-9 has a value of 3, then city c experienced 3 days of maximum temperature of \u2265 32 \u00b0C 9 months previously. In addition, Rain is a variable representing the total precipitation of each month and consists of the following three categories: < 34 mm, 72\u2013150 mm, and \u2265 150 mm.11 The bin of 34\u201372 mm is excluded from the equation, and the equation includes the rainfall of the current month and the past 12 months. This variable is included because it is known to affect health outcomes (Dell et al. 2014). The vector X includes the mothers\u2019 average age and education at the city/year-month level. Education is the proportion of mothers with no college degree. These variables are included because the mother\u2019s characteristics are likely to affect the number of births.",

That is, air pollution occurring in a certain month is not likely to affect temperature in the near future and thus is not likely to bias the estimates.

The difference may arise because the present study examines relatively recent data, while Barreca et al. (2018) analyze data obtained from 1931 to 2010. That is to say, people in modern times may respond differently to summer heat than people in the past. The former may use air conditioning more frequently than the latter and might be more accustomed to summer heat because they experience hot days more frequently. In fact, Barreca et al. (2018) found that the effect size declined after the 1960s. One additional factor that may make a difference in the two studies is that the mothers included in this study have a relatively high level of education. As shown in Table 2, mothers with no college degree account only for 39%, and the rest have a higher degree. Assuming that highly educated people have more knowledge about heat avoidance and more resources to follow through on this knowledge, this study should find smaller temperature effects.",
