While it is known that MVEV and SLEV cause encephalitis, by gaining access to neurons in the central nervous system through the infection of an olfactory nerve or the penetration of the blood-brain barrier, the molecular mechanisms of MVEV/SLEV infection of cells such as DCs, lymph nodes, visceral organs, nerves, and blood endothelium remain unknown. In the case of JEV, histopathological changes are observed in the lung, kidney, and liver of JE patients [4], but there is no evidence that JEV follows an infectious sequence in the human body that is similar to that of MVEV or SLEV in rodents.",

In cooperation with Toll-like receptors, C-type lectins also function as pathogen recognition receptors for the innate and adaptive immune responses [5].

Usage of DC-SIGN in viral infection has been reported for WNV [8], DV [9\u201311], and other viruses. Furthermore, nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the DC-SIGN-encoding gene are associated with the severity of diseases caused by DV [12], indicating an important role of DC-SIGN in DV pathogenesis. Given that WNV and DV are mosquito-borne viruses, the use of DC-SIGN as a receptor is most likely to occur following a mosquito bite, when the immature DCs residing in the skin become infected. It is also reported that the two viruses use DC-SIGNR [8, 11], which shares 77 % amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN, to infect the endothelium of lymph nodes and liver sinusoids [7]. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin) is a recently-identified C-type lectin [13] that is involved in the infections of a number of viruses, including filoviruses, SARS coronavirus, Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [14\u201316].",

Consequently, JEV was grown for use in infection in three mammalian cells: Vero9013 (monkey), A549 (human), and 293 (human). The results were generally similar when C6/36-derived JEV was compared with Vero9013- and A549-derived JEVs (Fig. 3B, C). When 293-derived JEV was used, both DC-SIGN and LSECtin expression resulted in an increase in the number of antigen-positive Daudi cells, but the effect was the opposite of that observed for infection with JEV derived from C6/36, Vero9013, and A549 cells. LSECtin-expressing Daudi cells showed a greater increase in the number of antigen-positive cells than DC-SIGN-expressing Daudi cells when infected with JEV derived from 293 cells (Fig. 3D). However, when infected with JEV derived from C6/36, Vero, and A549 cells, LSECtin-expressing Daudi cells showed less of an increase in the number of antigen-positive cells than DC-SIGN-expressing Daudi cells in each of three independent experiments (Fig. 3A-C). Thus, while each of the three lectins increased the susceptibility of Daudi cells to JEV infection, the host cells in which JEV was prepared affected the degree of susceptibility.",

The results shown in Fig. 3 led us to examine the glycosylation of the major envelope (E, approximately 50 kDa) and minor precursor M (prM, approximately 25 kDa) proteins of purified JEVs that had been grown in C6/36 and 293 cells [21]. Western blotting with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) lectin, which binds high-mannose N-glycan structures, detected proteins with a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 50 kDa (Fig. 4A). The detected bands were confirmed to be E proteins by the use of an E-specific antibody (Fig. 4B). No reactivity to E proteins was observed for the other plant lectins that were examined, namely Sambucus nigra agglutinin, Peanut agglutinin, and Datura stramonium agglutinin (data not shown). A small amount of uncleaved prM on JEV particles may have the potential to be involved in C-type-lectin-mediated viral infection due to N-glycosylation motifs within its deduced peptide sequence [21]. Molecules corresponding in size to prM (25 kDa) were not detected with any of the four plant lectins. Further analysis of carbohydrate modifications focused on the E protein because a JEV prM-specific antibody was not available. Pretreatment with either endoglycosidase H (to remove high-mannose or hybrid N-linked oligosaccharides) or PNGase F (to remove all N-linked oligosaccharides), reduced the MW of the E proteins of C6/36-derived JEV, as observed by western blotting. However, the effect of endoglycosidase H was very small (Fig. 4C, left panel). A similar reduction in the MW of the E protein after endoglycosidase treatment was observed with 293-derived JEV (Fig. 4C, right panel).\n",

JEV has two surface glycoproteins, the major protein E and the minor protein prM [1]. To our knowledge, all but one of the JEV isolates whose E- and prM-encoding sequences have been determined have one N-glycosylation motif in each deduced peptide sequence. The one known exception is Indonesia isolate JKT6468, which harbors two motifs in its predicted prM protein [25]. Furthermore, in the present study, the JEV-infection-enhancing effects of three C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, and LSECtin) were inhibited by cognate carbohydrates. Thus, even though only a single JEV isolate was used, the involvement of the three C-type lectins in JEV infection reported here can likely be considered to be a general characteristic of JEV.",

In the case of WNV and DV, DC-SIGN usage has been shown to be strongly related to cell origin. Insect-cell-derived, but not mammalian-cell-derived, viruses efficiently use DC-SIGN in infection. This difference is caused by carbohydrate modifications that differ according to the origin of the virus-producing cells [8, 26]. One exception is that WNV grown in Vero cells uses DC-SIGN [8]. In the present study, JEV prepared in an insect cell line used DC-SIGN efficiently, as did JEV prepared in some mammalian cell lines (including Vero and A549). Usage of DC-SIGN by mammalian-cell-derived JEV (Fig. 3B, C) may indicate the existence of specific cell types in the human body that produce JEV with the ability to use DC-SIGN in infection. However, because the glycan structures and glycosylation levels exhibited by tumor cells frequently differ from those of normal cells [27], DC-SIGN usage by mammalian-cell-derived JEV/WNV might not be observed in vivo. Studies with primary cell cultures from various human organs will be required to better characterize the effects of carbohydrate modifications on viral infectivity. Nevertheless, the carbohydrate status of the viral surface proteins of JEV prepared in insect C6/36 cells and mammalian 293 cells was tentatively compared to clarify their relationship to DC-SIGN usage. The results that were obtained suggest that while DC-SIGN usage by JEV is mediated by high-mannose structures on the E protein, the interaction between DC-SIGN and high-mannose structures could have been inhibited by structural hindrance of other modifications of the E protein or other unknown mechanisms. The prM protein does not seem to be significantly involved in DC-SIGN usage, due to the lack of a high-mannose structure and its absence within the JEV virion.",

Our finding that insect-cell-derived JEV efficiently binds to and infects DC-SIGN-expressing cells, suggests that JEV injected by mosquito bites goes toward DC-SIGN-expressing DCs/macrophages in the skin as a first target of infection, which is similar to WNV and DV [8, 26]. DC-SIGNR is typically detected in liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells and in alveolar and placental endothelial cells [7, 28]. Our results indicate that such cells can be highly susceptible to JEV infection produced from a range of hosts and cell types, and therefore that they might be major replication sites for JEV before brain invasion in vivo. Abortion and histopathological changes in the liver and lung caused by infection [4], virus isolation from the liver and placenta [29], and placenta susceptibility to infection in vitro [30] may occur due to the distribution of DC-SIGNR. Liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells also express LSECtin [13], which was shown by the authors to enhance JEV infection. The infection-enhancing effects of DC-SIGNR and LSECtin were mediated by distinct N-glycans, high-mannose and GlcNAc\u03b21-2Man, respectively. Thus, in the case of JEV infection, the two lectins are able to function synergistically on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells.",
