            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, and genus Alphacoronavirus [7]. There are two serotypes of FCoV: FCoV has been classified into types I and II based on the amino acid sequence of its spike (S) protein [11, 18]. Separate from these serotypes, FCoV has been classified into two biotypes: weakly pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV; avirulent FCoV) and strongly pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV; virulent FCoV) [20]. FIP is a lethal, immune-mediated infectious disease of members of the family Felidae, and there has been no established therapy for treatment. It has been suggested that FIPV is a mutant of FECV, i.e., it is considered that after infecting a cat, the open reading frame (ORF)2 gene and ORF3c gene of FECV partially mutates in the cat\u2019s body and becomes virulent FCoV, which is FIPV [21]. The presence of FCoVs with a broad pathogenic spectrum in the field has also been proposed as another hypothesis [2]. There are serotype I and II FECV and FIPV in FCoV. Serotype II FCoVs are known to utilize feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) as a virus receptor [6, 8].",

            "text": "There are 11 ORFs in the FCoV genome, and of these, ORF2, ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6 encode structural proteins [5]. The S protein, encoded by ORF2, plays an essential role in cell entry, being involved in binding to the FCoV-specific receptor on the host cell surface and fusion with the cell membrane [1]. The S protein also plays an important role in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection [9, 19, 34]. ADE is a phenomenon in which binding to an antibody makes host cell entry easier for the virus. We previously reported that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the S protein mediated ADE of FIPV infection [9]. When ADE of FIPV infection occurs, virus production in macrophages increases, and production of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6, is enhanced [27, 30, 31]. Therefore, ADE is closely associated with the severity of FIPV infection. However, no studies on the difference in pathogenicity between FIPV and FECV with regard to ADE of infection have been reported.",

After washing with PBS, the cells were cultured in the medium containing chloroquine or ammonium chloride, and the culture supernatants were collected after 48 h. The virus titer in the culture supernatant (TCID50) was determined by the method of Reed and Muench [22] with fcwf-4 cells.

FECV is assumed to cause almost no clinical symptoms because it does not readily infect primary feline monocytes or macrophages and it replicates only in local regions (intestinal epithelium) [3]. In contrast, FIPV is considered to cause FIP because it readily infects primary feline monocytes and macrophages and circulates throughout the body. However, the conserved FCoV 7b gene is also detected in regions other than the intestine in some cases of FECV infection [13, 16], and the reason for this has not yet been elucidated. Monocyte and macrophage infection by FIPV is potentiated in the presence of antibodies. It was assumed that the efficiency of infection of monocytes and macrophages by FECV increases in the presence of antibodies, as is observed with FIPV. If this assumption is correct, the mechanism of systemic circulation of enterocyte-tropic FECV may be explained. Thus, we investigated whether FECV has ADE activity.",

As U937 cells do not express fAPN, FIPV alone does not infect U937 cells, but it enters U937 cells via the cell-surface Fc receptor when anti-FCoV S antibodies are present [12, 31]. Furthermore, as no feline monocyte/macrophage cell line has been established, U937 cells are useful as a model to predict ADE activity of FCoV. In this study, FECV exhibited ADE activity in U937 cells, but the activity level was lower than that of FIPV. FIPV exhibited ADE activity in the presence of mAb 6-4-2 at several concentrations, but FECV was only active at a tenfold dilution of mAb 6-4-2, i.e., the monocyte infection efficiency of FIPV was enhanced in the presence of the antibody, but the increase in the efficiency of FECV infection in the presence of the antibody was only slight. We also investigated the difference in the ADE activity of FIPV and FECV in primary feline monocytes. The experiment was performed at an antibody concentration maximizing ADE activity of FECV based on the experimental results with U937 cells. ADE activity in primary feline monocytes was confirmed for both FIPV and FECV, but, similar to the results of the experiment with U937 cells, the ADE activity level of FECV was lower than that of FIPV. Specifically, the mean ADE activity level of FECV was approximately 1/20 of that of FIPV. FIPV-infected primary feline monocytes and macrophages expressing ADE release excess cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, as virus production increases [27, 28 30]. These cytokines cause a reduction in the number of lymphocytes and neutrophil activation, aggravating the FIP pathology. Therefore, high-level ADE activity is related to clinical aggravation to a serious state in FIPV-infected cats. Therefore, the low ADE activity of FECV may reflect the weak pathogenicity of FECV.",

FIPV does not require the virus receptor to enter cells to induce ADE [31], but FECV is assumed to require both Fc and virus receptors; therefore, FECV enters cells through an inefficient mechanism of ADE compared with FIPV. To demonstrate the necessity of fAPN for ADE activity of FECV, we investigated whether anti-fAPN mAb inhibits ADE activity of FECV in primary feline monocytes. Contrary to our assumption, it was confirmed that FECV, like FIPV, does not use fAPN for ADE, suggesting that the difference in replicability in ADE between FIPV and FECV occurs after entering cells. The non-fAPN-mediated cell entry mechanism in ADE of type II FCoV infection is unclear. It has been reported that several viruses do not utilize their virus receptors when they enter cells using antibodies [26], but the mechanism has not been elucidated. It has been reported that viruses possessing an envelope, such as FCoV, can fuse their envelope with the cell membrane without mediation by the virus receptor, depending on the conditions [35]. For the non-fAPN-mediated cell entry mechanism of type II FCoV, further investigation is necessary.",

However, the cell entry mechanism of FECV in ADE has not been clarified. We investigated its dependence on pH. In chloroquine- or ammonium-chloride-treated primary feline monocytes, FECV replication was strongly inhibited regardless of the presence or absence of mAb 6-4-2, suggesting that cell entry of FECV depends on the endosomal pH, regardless of the presence or absence of ADE.",

There is a strong association between clinical symptoms of FIP and inflammatory cytokine levels released by primary feline monocytes and macrophages with ADE [27, 28, 30]. The TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 mRNA levels significantly increased with ADE of FIPV infection, whereas no increase was noted in any of these despite ADE of FECV infection being observed. Several studies on the relationship between the amount of inflammatory cytokine production in virus-infected primary feline monocytes and macrophages and the severity of the disease have been reported. For example, in equine arteritis virus (EAV), virulent EAV significantly induces TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages compared with avirulent EAV, and a similar finding has been observed with equine infectious anemia virus [17]. Therefore, there may be a correlation between FCoV pathogenesis and the level of inflammatory cytokine production.",

It is necessary to closely analyze the ADE mechanism of FECV infection using cellular imaging and flow cytometry techniques. Furthermore, it is desirable to investigate whether there is a difference in ADE activity between FECV and FIPV similar to that observed in the present study in Fc-receptor-expressing cells (B cells and neutrophils) other than monocytes and macrophages. We hope that the present study helps further the understanding of ADE of FCoV infection and that it will help to elucidate ADE of serotype I FCoV infection.\n",
