A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is available, but would routine vaccination efforts be cost-effective? Publishing in the Lancet, an analysis of published and unpublished data on the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was undertaken to determine if vaccination would be cost-effective in 72 of the world's poorest countries. They concluded that if a US$5 vaccine shot reached every child in these countries, up to 407, 000 deaths per year would be prevented and 8.34 million disability-adjusted life years would be averted. At this price, vaccination would be extremely cost-effective in 68 out of 72 developing countries. Lancet",

Using this method they induced DCs in the blood of HIV-infected individuals to stimulate a Gag-specific killer T-cell response. Other research in mice has shown that DCs can stimulate helper T cell and antibody responses too. The team hope that this encouraging preclinical evidence will lay the foundations for the development of a prototype vaccine for testing in humans. PNAS",

The massive purchasing power of the GAVI Alliance, coupled with long-term contracts to buy vaccines, has led to huge price cuts. GAVI Alliance resources have enabled poor countries to introduce new vaccines, such as hepatitis B and yellow fever, and increase access to basic childhood vaccines, such as polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and measles.

Now, Stephen Graham and colleagues report that GBS is a prominent cause of neonatal sepsis in Africa after all. The research shows that the pattern of neonatal GBS diseases in Malawi is similar to that found in industrialized countries, except that outcomes for infants are markedly worse. Vaginal disinfection using chlorhexidine wipes during labour, in studies that were actually designed to reduce HIV transmission, markedly reduced maternal sepsis-related deaths. But the researchers caution that disinfection is unlikely to happen during unassisted deliveries. They recommend that vaccination, which has fallen off the public health agenda owing to successful GBS prophylaxis with antibiotics in developed countries, should be considered to tackle this problem.
