            "text": "Recently, DC-targeting nanocarriers have been developed for effective vaccines using the DC-specific delivery of Ag-encoding genes or exogenous antigens. For example, the replication-defective forms of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus,6,7 coronavirus,8 and lentivirus displaying the Sindbis virus glycoprotein9 have been used for DC-specific gene delivery. However, these vectors present the potential problems commonly observed in viral vectors, including unexpected immunological responses in patients, accidental disturbance of the patients\u2019 chromosomes, and unacceptability for Ags other than DNA. Nonviral vectors have also been utilized for delivering Ags to DCs. Nanoparticles consisting of poly(\u03b3-glutamic acid) could target DCs passively through systemic administration.10 Micelles consisting of poly(ethylene glycol)-based amphipathic polymer accumulated in nearly 20% of DCs in draining lymph nodes following intradermal injection.11 Liposomes (LPs) and Ags, modified with Fv forms of \u03b1-CD11c,12,13 bacterial flagellin-related peptide,14 and mannose,15 could target DCs more efficiently than passive targeting due to their specific interactions with DC surface molecules. Although these nonviral vectors may in part solve the viral vector-related problems described above, they potentially lack the mechanisms for infection and endosomal escape (eg, membrane fusiogenic domain of viral envelope proteins), leading to reduced immunogenicity of Ags due to low recognition efficiency of DCs. Therefore, it is necessary to endow nonviral vectors with both targeting ability and membrane fusiogenic activity in order to develop effective DC-targeting nanocarriers for future vaccines.",

The mutated BNC (ZZ-BNC) can tether IgG Fc regions and display IgG Fv regions outwardly for the effective binding of Ags in an oriented-immobilization manner (Figure 1B),24 while retaining membrane fusiogenic activity. ZZ-BNCs displaying \u03b1-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies efficiently targeted EGFR-overexpressing glioblastoma in vivo following intracerebroventricular injection.25 These properties of ZZ-BNCs may be useful for active targeting and the introduction of Ags to DCs, making DC-mediated vaccination a promising approach. In this study, ZZ-BNCs displaying \u03b1-DC antibodies (\u03b1-DC-ZZ-BNCs) were evaluated for both targeting and introduction into splenic DCs in vitro and in vivo. The \u03b1-DC-ZZ-BNCs could be used for DC-specific nanocarriers following the fusion with LPs containing antigens.",

Flow cytometric analyses showed that ZZ-BNCs displaying \u03b1-CD11c antibodies (clone N418) and \u03b1-MHC class II antibodies accumulated on 86% and 84% of splenic DCs, respectively (Figure 2A). Other \u03b1-DC antibodies unexpectedly showed lower extents of accumulation, which were similar to those of mouse IgGs and ZZ-BNC alone, but higher than that of BNC alone. These results were confirmed from the mean fluorescent intensities of DCs incubated with each Cy5-labeled \u03b1-DC-ZZ-BNC complex (Figure 2B). The difference in DC accumulation among the \u03b1-DC antibodies may be caused by either the number of antibodies on ZZ-BNC or the affinity of each antibody to DCs. Because cell surface molecules on splenic DCs show high affinity to IgGs and ZZ domains,31\u201333 ZZ-BNCs displaying mouse IgGs and ZZ-BNC alone may accumulate on DCs. Furthermore, since BNCs and ZZ-BNCs possess high-mannose sugar chains,17 the mannose receptors of DCs may contribute to the interaction with them.34",

Each organ was observed for CF750-derived fluorescence on an OV-100 in vivo imaging system. As shown in Figure 3A, both ZZ-BNCs and BNCs were found to localize in the liver and spleen preferentially. Because the spleen contains a larger number of lymphoid-resident DCs than the liver, and because splenic DCs can induce higher immune responses against exogenous Ags than hepatic DCs,35 we selected splenic DCs as the target of \u03b1-DC-ZZ-BNC for further study. Among the CF750-labeled \u03b1-DC-ZZ-BNC complexes, \u03b1-CD11c (clone N418) antibodies delivered CF750-labeled ZZ-BNCs to the spleen with the highest specificity (Figure 3B and C). Mouse total IgGs, \u03b1-MHC class II antibodies, and ZZ domains could also deliver CF750-labeled ZZ-BNCs to the spleen to some extent, suggesting that these molecules have an affinity to splenic DCs, as described previously.31\u201333",

At 40 minutes after injection, the mice were sacrificed and their spleens were extirpated. The splenocytes were isolated using a gentleMACS\u2122 dissociator and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 4A). The Cy5-labeled \u03b1-CD11c (clone N418)-ZZ-BNC complexes were detected in approximately 62% of the CD11c+ splenocytes, while the other Cy5-labeled ZZ-BNC complexes, Cy5-labeled ZZ-BNCs, and Cy5-labeled BNCs, were detected in a lower population of CD11c+ splenocytes. Moreover, since Cy5-labeled \u03b1-CD11c (clone N418)-ZZ-BNC complexes were detected in 2.0% of CD11c\u2212 splenocytes (Figure 4B), it was determined that the complexes have high specificity to splenic CD11c+ cells in vivo. Next, CD11c+ cells were purified from the splenocytes by magnetic cell sorting with MACS using \u03b1-CD11c-labeled magnetic beads, stained immunocytochemically with FITC-labeled \u03b1-CD11c antibodies, and then observed under LSM (Figure 5).

BNCs were shown to form a stable complex with LP spontaneously and deliver the complex in a cell- and tissue-specific manner in vivo and in vivo.21 After mixing ZZ-BNCs with cationic LPs, the ZZ-BNC-LP complexes were purified by CsCl isopycnic ultracentrifugation, followed by dialysis against PBS. The complexes consisted of 19.5 \u03bcg/mL of ZZ-L protein and 65.6 \u03bcg/mL of LPs, of which the Z-average (diameter) and \u03b6-potential were 426 nm (Polydispersity Index [PDI], 0.331) and \u22125.76 mV, respectively. For evaluating in vivo delivery specifically to splenic DCs, we chose domain III (D3) of the JEV envelope protein as a control Ag. D3 antigen was expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified, as described previously.29 The ZZ-BNC-LP complex (120 \u03bcg as ZZ-L protein, 404 \u03bcg as LPs) was allowed to conjugate with 60 \u03bcg of D3 antigen by electrostatic interaction and to display 24 \u03bcg of \u03b1-CD11c antibodies (clone N418) on the complex. The Z-averages and \u03b6-potentials of \u03b1-CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes, ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes, and LP-D3 complexes were 455 nm (PDI, 0.398), 324 nm (PDI, 0.261), and 106 nm (PDI, 0.130), and \u22129.53 mV, \u22121.87 mV, and 43.4 mV, respectively. While both the diameter and \u03b6-potential of \u03b1-DC-ZZ-BNC complexes were suitable for systemic administration, the conjugation with LPs increased their diameters to greater than 100 nm. However, because the spleen can readily capture nanoparticles of more than 200 nm in diameter from the bloodstream,36 it was considered that the \u03b1-CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes could deliver D3 antigens to splenic DCs efficiently following intravenous injection. Mice were immunized intravenously with \u03b1-CD11c (clone N418)-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes (20 \u03bcg, as D3 antigen, per mouse) without adjuvant twice with a 4-week interval. D3 alone, LP-D3 complexes, and ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes were used as control vaccines. These control vaccines, containing 20 \u03bcg of D3 antigen, were injected into each mouse in the same way. At 4 and 6 weeks after the first immunization, blood samples were collected from the tail vein for determination of serum \u03b1-D3 IgGs by ELISA (Figure 6). At 4 weeks, no significant elicitation of \u03b1-D3 IgGs was observed in any mouse. Only \u03b1-CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes elicited high titers of \u03b1-D3 IgGs at 6 weeks, while the other control vaccines containing the same amounts of D3 antigen did not. \u03b1-CD11c (clone N418)-ZZ-BNCs accumulated in splenic DCs in vivo following intravenous injection (see Figure 5), which strongly suggested that \u03b1-CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP complexes were able to effectively deliver D3 antigens to the inside of splenic DCs.",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence have recently indicated that DC targeting mediated by CD11c is superior to that mediated by other molecules. In human monocytes, including DCs, CD11c molecules form heterodimers with CD18 molecules, also known as complement receptor 4 (CR4).37 Because CR4 mediates phagocytosis, \u03b1-CD11c-ZZ-BNC complexes may facilitate the efficient uptake of D3 antigens by DCs, leading to the effective induction of an \u03b1-D3 immune response. Moreover, it has been reported that \u03b1-CD11c F(ab)2-conjugated Ags accumulated in the splenic marginal zone following intravenous injection and then migrated into the splenic T cell zone, while \u03b1-MHC class II F(ab)2-conjugated Ags accumulated in the splenic B cell zone.38 This result strongly suggested that DCs in the splenic marginal zone were stimulated with Ags in a CD11c-dependent manner and then migrated into the splenic T cell zone. Taken together, the \u03b1-CD11c-ZZ-BNC-LP-D3 complexes are postulated to accumulate in splenic DCs, stimulate DCs with D3 antigens, move DCs from the marginal zone to the T cell zone, present fragments of D3 antigen with MHC molecules to T cells along with co-stimulating factors (eg, CD80, CD86), and then induce D3-dependent immune responses including the production of \u03b1-D3 IgGs. Regarding the administration route, it is rare to administer vaccines intravenously. We should evaluate whether this vaccine platform could target migratory DCs (eg, Langerhans cells) in mice after intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.",
