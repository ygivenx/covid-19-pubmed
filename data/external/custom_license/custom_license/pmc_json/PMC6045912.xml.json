Nowadays, parallel computation techniques permit the estimation of highly resolved phylogenies for large populations20. However, the partition of phylogenetic trees23,24 is a challenging task and there is not yet an established automated consensus methodology to identify transmission clusters, particularly when considering large-scale phylogenies. Furthermore, the definition of a transmission cluster itself is not standardized15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Transmission clusters have been associated to sub-trees of phylogenies containing sequences from at least x distinct subjects15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 (from a minimum of two patients to more than ten patients) with a sub-tree reliability of \u2265 y% (usually bootstrap support or posterior probability, ranging from 80 to 99%21,18). Geographical constraints, that is, \u2265 z% of sequences from the same country in a cluster (usually z \u2265 80%), have been also introduced20. Often, unrelated viral strains from different countries are added as controls, and clusters are identified by visually inspecting an initial tree or by re-estimating smaller trees after reducing the original data set15,17. Cluster selection based on absolute genetic15,17 and patristic18,21 distance values has also been used.",

The method is then applied for identifying transmission clusters within the HIV-1 subtype B epidemic in Italy. Data were drawn from the Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis (ARCA), a national observational cohort of HIV-1-infected patients (http://www.hivarca.net) followed up at 105 clinical centres. At the time of this study, data from >20,000 patients and >23,000 HIV-1 pol gene sequences were available. A phylogeny on the Italian HIV-1 subtype B isolates was estimated by parallel computation and, after applying the new partition method, clustering was linked with patients' demographic and clinical information. As a result, several factors associated with transmission chains were identified, suggesting strategies to monitor the epidemic. The methodology proposed here provides a general and robust framework for analysing large-scale phylogenies that can be applied in investigating the molecular epidemiology and the intra-host evolutionary patterns of a broad range of pathogens.",

Of note, at the 30th percentile threshold, about a half of the sequences were placed in two distinct clusters (n=5,785 and n=1,538), both exceeding in size the number of un-clustered isolates (n=897). At thresholds below the 30th percentile, the maximum cluster size was always inferior to the number of un-clustered isolates (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, the 30th percentile threshold behaved as a break-point: all subsequent analyses yielded similar results across lower thresholds, whereas the same did not always held when considering both thresholds above and below the break-point. The partitions retrieved at different thresholds exhibited a mild rate of agreement, with a peak at the 15th percentile threshold (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Sequences without epidemiological information were ignored, and only the earliest available sequence per patient was considered. Each cluster was evaluated checking if it was composed exclusively either by a single or by a mixture of different demographic factors. The estimated proportions were then compared against those that would be expected by chance after randomly shuffling the cluster indices. We found an excess in the proportion of clusters composed solely by patients living in the Northern Italy (31 versus 17%, P<0.0001), by those living in the Central Italy (25 versus 16%, P=0.0008), by male homosexuals (27 versus 16%, P<0.0001), by male homosexuals and heterosexuals together (20 versus 10%, P<0.0001), by patients infected recently (within three years from the first HIV-1 positive test, 35 versus 19%, P<0.0001), by ART-naive patients without any drug-resistance mutation (15 versus 6%, P<0.0001), by patients with high HIV-1 RNA load (above 10,000 copies per ml, 43 versus 34%, P=0.02), by patients carrying at least one resistance mutation to nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI) (26 versus 19%, P=0.007; 10 versus 6%, P=0.02, respectively). Conversely, we observed a proportion significantly lower than expected for clusters comprising male homosexuals and injecting drug users (IDUs) together (3 versus 9%, P<0.0001), male homosexuals and heterosexuals and IDU together (11 versus 25%, P<0.0001), and patients living in the Northern Italy and in the Central Italy (27 versus 42%, P<0.0001). Notably, although the proportions of clusters composed by patients either naive or carrying any drug-resistance mutation were exceeding those expected by chance, along with the mixtures of ART-exposed/ART-naive and patients with/without resistance, there was no excess in the proportion of naive patients carrying any drug-resistance mutation (2 versus 2%, P=0.898).

On the contrary, the presence of at least one drug-resistance mutation to NRTI and PI was not associated with clustering. The mode of HIV transmission was the factor that exhibited opposite behaviours by varying the threshold: at low thresholds male homosexuals and heterosexuals tended to cluster more than IDU, whereas the contrary held at higher thresholds.

This approach conjugates the evaluation of node reliability, tree topology and patristic distance analysis. Previous approaches have lacked, in general, not only a standardized definition of a transmission cluster, but also a formal algorithmic procedure for the detection of reliable transmission clusters within a phylogeny. In the studies by Lewis et al.15 and Hughes et al.,17 clusters were identified on large data sets using a fixed threshold on genetic distances, and then confirmed by phylogenetic trees constructed afterwards. Another approach was the CTree algorithm24, originally applied to viral sub-typing, which does not account for node reliability and is not applicable to large data sets in its current implementation. Other available methods have used different cluster selection schemes by performing nested phylogenetic analyses, and/or adding criteria for geographical consistency15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22, but in most cases the assessment of transmission clusters is still subject to a visual tree inspection. The definition of a transmission cluster proposed here is general and can be tuned to accommodate any of the previous definitions. The method can be of interest for epidemiologists because obtained partitions could be used in multi-level modelling.",

The transmission clusters detected in our study population were preferentially composed either by male homosexuals only or by male homosexuals and heterosexuals together. As male homosexuals (and presumably male bisexuals) are a primary source of the cluster composition, this could be considered for designing targeted population screenings and interventions. On the other hand, there was a negative association between male homosexuals/heterosexuals and IDU. We found that ART-naive patients cluster both with other ART-naive and with ART-experienced patients, in various configurations with respect to the carriage of drug-resistance mutation. Although the direction of the transmission cannot easily be inferred, the proportion of clusters composed exclusively by ART-naive patients carrying at least one drug-resistance mutation in our population study (so presumably transmitting the resistance to each other) was \u22482%, a low proportion, comparable to a previous estimation in the United Kingdom16. A substantial responsibility of drug-resistance transmission is still carried by the ART-experienced population, suggesting that any decrease in the prevalence of drug-resistance in the ART-experienced population could translate into a reduction of the proportion of new infections with drug-resistant virus.",

Another possibility, however, is that some newly infected patients might not be aware of being infected, and therefore continue to engage in risky sexual behaviours. Recently, infected and untreated patients are also more likely to have higher viral loads, resulting in higher probability of transmission6. Thus, efforts to expand HIV-1 testing programmes should be a successful strategy to reduce the rates of HIV-1 transmission. Concomitantly, the association of higher HIV-1 RNA loads and CD4+ counts with transmission clustering emphasizes the need of early diagnoses and suggests how early treatment may be useful in reducing HIV-1 transmission events.",

            "text": "This work has some limitations. First, epidemiological conclusions may change slightly or dramatically depending on the choice of the threshold. By evaluating the algorithm on different data sets, and using different definitions of a transmission cluster, the optimal threshold spanned a large range, from 0.04 to 0.08 nucleotide substitutions per site, whereas previous studies used more stringent criteria (either 0.015 or 0.031)18,21. Ideally, a transmission chain, at least in the context of a single subtype phylogeny of HIV-1 isolates, should be defined by an absolute threshold. At the moment, the lack of epidemiologically confirmed data precludes such a precise estimation. Nonetheless, the present method offers a rational validation strategy to identify an appropriate cutoff, depending on the specific data set under investigation and on the (strict or loose) definition of a transmission cluster. Second, complete demographic and clinical information were missing for a relevant proportion of patients enrolled in ARCA. A non-uniform sequence sampling has most likely occurred overtime. Most of the sequences included in our analysis were derived from ART-experienced patients tested at virological failure. Although repeated measures and convergent evolution due to treatments were accounted for, the analysis lacked a sample contribution from recently infected patients. Sampling could potentially distort results when analysing factors associated with transmission chains20. Finally, the partition method is fully dependent on the phylogenetic tree: if the tree is unreliable, then so is the cluster identification. The estimation of highly resolved and reliable phylogenies from large data sets is still a challenge and requires massively parallelized routines, especially for maximum likelihood or Bayesian tree inference. For this reason, the approach based on nested phylogenies might be still a preferable choice.",

At each step of the depth-first visit, a sub-tree was identified as a cluster if the median value of the sub-tree distance distribution was below a t-percentile threshold of the whole-tree distance distribution. If this condition was met in a node, the search at that node was stopped, ignoring the children nodes, passing to analyse other node siblings. The threshold t was evaluated and optimized over the range [5th, 50th] percentile of the whole-tree distance distribution, with a step of 0.05.

If the java virtual machine is initialized with at least 8 Gb of RAM, it is possible to compute exactly a full matrix for a tree with \u224810,000 leaves.

The number of control sequences was the same as that of sequences linked to the transmission events. Thus, a total of 127 sequences were considered in the subsequent phylogenetic analysis.

However, if two potential transmission clusters happened to share a MRCA with a reliability value of \u2265 90%, but the two lineages departing from that MRCA exhibited long branch lengths, then they were considered as two independent transmission chains.
