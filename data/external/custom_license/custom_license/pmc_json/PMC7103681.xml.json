Turkey coronavirus was precipitated with ammonium sulfate but with low recoveries compared with ultracentrifugation (60% sucrose cushion) [25]. Other virus particles were precipitated with varying combinations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride. In particular, PEG precipitation of bovine rotavirus particles resulted in an approximately tenfold better yield than pelleting by high-speed centrifugation based on results determined by the tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay [27]. This could be owing to increased damage of virus particles during high-speed centrifugation [27] or an irreversible aggregation of virus particles leading to overall reduced TCID50 measurements. Furthermore, precipitation of AAV vectors via PEG can lead to an enhanced purity compared with the classically conducted cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient ultracentrifugation [19].",

For industrial scales only continuous flow centrifugation methods can be considered as they allow handling of larger volumes. However, these methods require high investment costs and suffer in some cases from losses of infectivity [33,38,47], leading to an increased usage of ultrafiltration techniques particularly outside of laboratory scales. A clear advantage of centrifigation methods is their potential to separate some assembled viral vectors from their empty capsids, which is commonly challenging with other separation techniques [38]. Another advantage is in the DSP of viruses with frequently changing strains (e.g., influenza) as these centrifugation methods are robust in relation to viral strain differences, which resulted in a rediscovery of this technology for a number of processes.",

Frequently, membranes with pore sizes in the range of 0.45\u20131 \u00b5m are applied, although this technique involves the risk of viral losses [44,64,65]. Recoveries depend on the initial membrane pore size, type of membrane (material), quality of the crude stock, virus (i.e., size), virus subtype and its aggregation behavior, applied buffer conditions, filtration rate, nature and level of protein concentration in the filtrate, and extent of pore obstruction as demonstrated for retroviral vectors [65]. Virus losses are mainly attributed to mechanical disruption, particularly for active virus particles (i.e., gene therapy vectors), exclusion of virus particles [64] and membrane entrapment as well as unspecific virus adsorption. Losses due to pore obstruction can be reduced by applying membrane cascades with decreasing pore sizes or filter capsules with dual membranes to minimize membrane fouling [50,66,67] and applying larger membrane areas (i.e., frequent changes of the filtration units or usage of larger units) to limit the volume of supernatant per membrane surface.",

Pore sizes defining the MWCO are normally distributed about the mean pore size, which varies depending on the production method for the membrane, and therefore also between the manufacturers. In order to minimize product losses via the permeate, the MWCO has to be significantly smaller than the virus particle. However, if the MWCO selected is too small, permeate fluxes are reduced,, which leads to longer filtration times, increased TMP and decreases the possibility of reducing the amount of contaminating proteins and nucleic acids. Furthermore, membrane fouling, which decreases the permeate flux, can often be greater for larger pore size membranes than for smaller ones. Here, small virus particles but also cell and virus debris are able to enter the pores where they are eventually trapped in constricted channels. Asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes with the finer filtering surface facing the feed suspension should be applied where possible to reduce internal fouling.",

Protein-free media only include defined polypeptides and amino acids. The higher the concentration of proteins, target virus, and nucleic acids and the larger the size of contaminating DNA fragments in the retentate, the higher the sample viscosity, leading to a continuously decreasing permeate flux at constant TMP. Additionally, high retentate protein concentrations result in an increased degree of concentration polarization, which also reduces the permeate flux [71].

For small scales (up to 10 ml) centrifugal filtration devices are well suited, and for small to medium volumes (10\u2013300 ml) stirred cell tanks are ideal. Larger volumes are usually concentrated by tangential flow filtration. There are three types of membranes available: tubular membranes, flat sheets (cassettes) and hollow-fiber membranes from which the latter two are commonly used in the biopharmaceutical industry. Generally, flat-sheet and tubular tangential-flow membrane modules have higher mass transfer coefficients at low cross-flow rates compared with hollow-fiber modules. The latter have wide feed flow paths, providing laminar flow with low shear rates [76], which are crucial processing life vaccines and gene therapy vectors. High shear rates can significantly reduce their efficacy and overall yield. A general advantage of hollow-fiber membrane modules compared with flat sheets is the high membrane surface-to-module volume ratio. However, individual modules of flat-sheet tangential-flow membrane modules are easier to clean and replacement of defective membrane elements is uncomplicated. Overall, the type of membranes eventually used for a specific process depends largely on the viscosity, solid content and volume of the feed as well as the product stability (shear-sensitivity). Thus, for the concentration or diafiltration of active virus particles, hollow-fiber membranes are superior to flat-sheet membranes.",

Polymer-based beads either consist of natural polymers (agarose, agarose-dextran composites, cellulose and dextran) or synthetic polymers (polyacrylamide, polystyrene divinylbenzene, derivatives of polyacrylamide derivatives and polymethacrylate) [80]. Examples for inorganic matrices used for the purification of virus particles are hydroxyapatite [81\u201383], silica [84] and controlled-pore glass [85,86]. Beads can be spherical and nonspherical shaped and are available as porous, nonporous and solid-core resins. Pore sizes of conventional porous beads range from 10 to 100 nm [79], although specific particles with pore diameters of up to 400 nm are available [33]. Virus particles vary generally from 30 nm to greater than 300 nm (Table 2). Hence, the material transport of virus particles is limited by pore-diffusion or pore-exclusion effects. Even small virus particles, which are able to enter large pores, diffuse through the intra-particular channels two- to 100-fold slower than proteins [87]. In fact, the majority of chromatography resins currently available are optimized for purification of proteins rather than virus particles, which primarily adsorb to the outer bead surface [88]. Furthermore, the inter-particle porosity for packed beds can reach values of maximally 40%, whereas for stationary phases such as monoliths this value can be up to 90% or more [89].",

The advantages of hollow-fiber membrane adsorbers are the high surface area and the reduction in particle accumulation near the pore entrance owing to the cross-flow principle used during separation. However, the breakthrough of target compounds is generally broadened, leading to poor adsorber utilization compared with flat sheets [97]. Furthermore, eluted products are heavily diluted and internal mixing within the fiber housing results in low resolutions, and the application of gradient elution is very limited. Radial-flow adsorbers have flat-sheet membranes spirally wound over a cylindrical core [97] whereby the available surface area can be significantly increased. Thus, the volume-to-surface area for spiral-wound membrane adsorbers is better than for the majority of hollow-fiber adsorbers. Still, products are diluted and gradient elutions are accordingly challenging. Flat sheets are mainly used as stacks of numerous individual sheets providing a larger adsorbent volume. In flat-sheet membrane adsorbers the liquid is commonly introduced vertical to the membrane adsorber surface, allowing a minimum dead volume in an optimally designed membrane module. Thus, these membrane adsorbers do not suffer from diluted product fractions and can be used for gradient elution procedures.",

Depending on the overall isoelectric point (Table 2) of the individual virus particles, cation- or anion exchange chromatography (AEC) matrixes are utilized. Different variations of IEC have been applied for the purification of a variety of viruses (Table 4). Adsorbed virus particles are in general displaced by an increasing ionic strength. Alternatively, they are desorbed by a change in buffer pH, leading to an unfavorable overall charge of the virus surface or the matrix, at which the virus particles do not bind anymore. IEC has a relatively low specificity resulting in a reduced dynamic binding capacity for the target virus and often results in co-elutions of contaminants (e.g., host cell DNA for AEC). Differential elution between the target virus and contaminants can sometimes be achieved by linear- or step-gradient elutions. If high salt concentrations or nonphysiological pH conditions are required for purification, it is crucial to monitor immunogenicity or transfection efficiency of virus particles [47,304]. Hence, IEC matrices have to be carefully selected in terms of the type of charged groups, ligand density, and applied buffer conditions with respect to the virus type, product application and utilized assays for process characterization.",

            "text": "Affinity chromatography of virus particles relies on a specific and reversible adsorption and subsequent recovery of the active target virus from a ligand immobilized onto the chromatography matrix. The specific interactions between ligand and virus are based on individual structural properties, and the virus particles are commonly eluted by an altered conformation via a changed buffer pH or ionic strength or competitive displacement. However, the latter is generally not economic for large-scale production processes, but is frequently applied at smaller scales. Applied ligands or matrices for the purification of virus particles are immobilized metal ion affinity [103,104], sulfated carbohydrates (e.g., heparin) [100,105\u2013107], specific antibodies [108] or antibody fragments, biotin streptavidine system for recombinant viral vectors [109], lectins [110,111], DNA aptamers [112] and peptides (Table 4). For the majority of viruses, no specific ligands are known, resulting in the application of less-specific ligands such as lectins or sulfated carbohydrates (i.e., heparin). Lectins interact with accessible carbohydrate moieties of the surface glycoproteins according to their specificity. Heparin is primarily a weak and strong cation exchanger containing sulfo and carboxyl groups as well as numerous hydroxyl groups [113]. Desorption of the virus particles from heparin matrices is done by increasing the ionic strength. However, it often requires a higher ionic strength than for classical cation exchangers owing to the multivalent interactions of the branched linear structure of heparin and the formation of hydrogen bonding between the target virus and heparin [113]. An alternative to laborious ligand screens or the application of less specific pseudo-affinity ligands are engineered viral vectors containing affinity tags on the virus surface [109,114]. Crucial for specific affinity ligands is the consideration of their dissociation constants. For recombinant proteins, dissociation constants of 10-4\u201310-10 M are usually considered a good working range [115]. Optimal affinity ligands allow fast binding kinetics for high flow rates but mild elution conditions to avoid reduction in immunogenicity or activity. Therefore, it is essential to consider the overall binding strength of large virus particles, which is due to the already discussed multivalent interactions. If proteins or larger biomolecules are used as ligands, their potential toxicity or immunogenicity has to be considered and, if applied, assays have to be developed for their detection and quantification. Furthermore, for many proteins, high costs are associated and the low stability of these ligands towards sanitizing agents in some cases prohibits their application for large-scale processes [116]. In some cases, additional drawbacks of specific ligands are their restricted application as platform technology and limited process robustness for vaccines with frequently varying subtypes (e.g., influenza vaccines). Furthermore, for viruses with varying progenies (e.g., Vaccinia virus) [117], some virus particles might be excluded, thereby affecting the overall yield. On the other hand, the applied specificity allows the separation of specific progenies. Ligands targeting post-translational modifications on the virus surface are heavily susceptible to the cultivation conditions and host cells [118]. Hence, target epitopes for AC matrices on the virus surface have to be carefully selected, considering their stability during the entire process. Nevertheless, matrices with highly specific affinity ligands and high dynamic binding capacities are very well suited to capture virus particles after clarification from low concentrated cultivation broths.",

It is routinely used for bioseparations of proteins [119\u2013122], and has also been applied for virus purification [100,113] since it is an orthogonal separation technique to purification methods based on ionic interactions. However, many factors such as type of salt and ionic strength of buffer, pH, temperature, ligand and ligand density influence the performance of HIC, making its development and optimization a difficult and time-consuming endeavor. The two most commonly used HIC ligands are butyl and phenyl [113]. Interactions with these ligands are relatively strong and have been frequently cited to denature labile proteins, potentially reducing their efficacy. However, often proteins subjected to these methods revert upon elution to their native structure [113]. Even so, if used for purification of gene transfer vectors or vaccines, their transfection efficiency or immunogenicity has to be closely monitored, just as for the high salt applications for the IEC methods. Stronger HIC ligands such as hexyl and octyl are commonly destructive to proteins, and most likely also to virus particles or gene therapy vectors if applied in positive mode. Furthermore, HIC requires the application of high concentrations of kosmotropic salts, which potentially also reduces virus efficacies. Also, the application of high salt concentrations influences virus aggregation in the majority of cases, affecting further downstream processes and often process analytics. In addition, disaggregation of the formed aggregates usually impacts virus transfection efficiency and immunogenicity. Nevertheless, it was recently shown that HIC can be successfully applied to remove residual DNA after AC for purification of active Vaccinia virus particles (MVA-BN\u00ae; Bavarian Nordic A/S, Kvistgaard, Denmark) (Table 4)[100,305].",

The driving force for the increasing interest in single-use concepts for the production of viral vaccines is the fast and highly flexible set up of production processes, which is expected to improve the response time for increasing vaccine demands such as for pandemic preparations. In addition, disposable concepts for limited production campaigns are economically attractive considering that under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) standards, raw material and equipment in direct contact with the product have to be dedicated to the particular production process [137]. Furthermore, single-use concepts commonly reduce or eliminate time-consuming and cost-intensive process steps such as cleaning and sanitization and their validation. However, the economic application depends heavily on the scale and requirements of the individual product, in addition to the available production facilities.

In the ease of operation they are comparable to plasmid purification kits and require approximately 2 h for the entire process. The majority of manufacturers rely on adsorption membrane technology based on centrifugal devices (small scale), syringe capsules (small scale) or larger capsules for fast protein liquid chromatography systems. Purification of lentivirus and AAV particles is mainly achieved by the use of AEX and cation-exchange (CEX) membrane adsorbers. According to the manufacturer\u2019s handbooks, the maximum capacities of the largest units currently available are approximately 1 \u00d7 1012 and 3 \u00d7 1013 total virus particles for adenovirus and AAV, respectively, and 2 \u00d7 108 infectious particles for lentivirus. The required culture volumes range from 20 to 500 ml, allowing recoveries of approximately 60\u201380% of the total particles depending on the culture conditions and virus. For the best results, it is important to consider the virus type for which the respective kit has been optimized. However, the kits can be used for other virus species after adapting the operating conditions. Importantly, nucleic acids (i.e., host cell DNA and proteoglycans) will also bind to AEX membrane adsorbers and potentially co-elute. Hence, kit procedures often include nuclease treatment of the harvest to reduce nucleic acid contaminations and to improve the flow rates and thus process time (i.e., kits for adenovirus purification). In addition, a digestion step using chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme that degrades glycosaminoglycan side chains of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans [138], is sometimes included to remove proteoglycan contaminations. Certainly, the purity of the resulting virus fractions heavily depends on culture conditions, virus species, type and strain, as well as the applied kit. Therefore, no detailed information on virus purity can be provided by the manufacturers. It should also be pointed out, however, that viruses purified by this method can only be used for research purposes and are not intended for clinical studies or medical applications.",

For the development of new purification schemes it will be equally important to develop and optimize new technologies, as to design efficient DSP trains based on optimal combinations of these new technologies with currently used methods. Unfortunately, very few complete purification schemes, from culture supernatant to clinical grade virus product, have been described in detail with overall recoveries and degree of contaminations in the literature.

Levels of contaminating host cell DNA for gene therapy applications are even lower.

For many applications these levels can only be achieved via nuclease treatments such as Benzonase. The clear advantage of such a treatment is the elimination of potential oncogenes or other functional DNA sequences [142] even in very low amounts of host cell DNA and the cleavage of nucleic acids adsorbed to the target virus.

Gene therapy in contrast is a relatively new but promising technology with the revolution of molecular genetics in the 1970s paving the way into successful medical applications [158]. Vaccines currently comprise a rapidly growing market within the biopharmaceutical industry and gene therapy vectors have the potential to follow this line. Nevertheless, for some vaccines, manufacturing capacities are still limited (i.e., for pandemic influenza vaccines). In general these problems are related to both, upsteam processing and DSP, and can only be efficiently solved if both are considered together. In the last 10 years, upstream production processes of some vaccines moved away from their respective classical systems to the usage of diploid and continuous cell lines. However, downstream purification trains were in many cases only adapted to the new requirements but still lack further optimization. Main improvements for vaccine purifications have to be governed by enhanced throughputs, capacities and potentially specificities of individual unit operations, as well as an enhanced linking of applied unit operations and the reduction of the number of purification steps. Process development for gene therapy vectors could significantly benefit from the experience accumulated in vaccine production, especially with vectors derived from vaccines. Nevertheless, there are still several technical problems to be solved for both product classes such as the Benzonase-free removal of host cell nucleic acids. Specific difficulties for the purification of gene therapy vectors are:\n\u2022 High final vector titers;\u2022 Removal of transduction inhibitors from producer cells (proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans [159\u2013161]);\u2022 Elimination of free envelope proteins, defective-virus particles and empty capsids.",

Of note, the reduced starting levels of process-related protein contaminations are mainly due to increased usage of serum-free, protein-free or even fully defined media for upstream cultivations \u2013 an excellent example for improved overall process economics via a tighter coupling of up- and down-stream methods.",

Current advances in the field indicate that increased application of high-throughput automated scaled-down models in combination with good mathematical models for experimental design and process development will support these efforts. Certainly, these advances will also require the establishment of high-throughput assay platforms for precise and reliable process characterization. As a result, unit operations should be available that have not only higher specificity and increased volumetric throughput but also enable design of purification trains with a reduced number of steps.",

Furthermore, single use concepts and the introduction of continuous DSP methods will play an important role as well as tighter process integration in terms of the up- and downstream process. Furthermore, the establishment of platform technologies will have high priority whereas a large step towards platform technologies has already been accomplished by the development of downstream purification kits for gene therapy vectors.",
