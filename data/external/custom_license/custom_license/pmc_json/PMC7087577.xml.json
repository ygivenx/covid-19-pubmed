Otters are well spread through Portugal (Trindade et al. 1998) and may be found in a wide range of aquatic environments, from very small streams and large rivers to dams, including also coastal and estuarine environments (Santos-Reis et al. 1995). Otter densities in Portugal are unknown but suspected to be high (Santos-Reis et al. 2003), in opposition to many European countries, where otter populations progressively declined since the beginning of the twentieth century (Mason and Macdonald 1986) and only now are apparently recovering (Cort\u00e9s et al. 1998).",

Otters can be affected by viral, bacterial, mycotic and parasitic diseases. Most studies regarding bacterial diseases in otters concern the American river otters (Lutra canadensis). These are shown to be sensitive to genitourinary infections promoted by Proteus mirabilis, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and beta-haemolytic Escherichia coli (Hoover and Tyler 1986). The presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae has been related to retropharyngeal abscesses (Hoover and Tyler, 1986). Regarding the Eurasian otters, they were shown to be a possible natural reservoir for pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotubeculosis, playing an important role in the epidemiology of yersinioses (Nikolova et al. 2001). Studies regarding southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris) infectious diseases and necropsy data are also available (Smith et al. 2002; Hanni et al. 2003; Kreuder et al. 2003).",

Eight river stretches, with approximately 8 km each and spread throughout the basin to represent the several types of existing streams (ditches to main river) were chosen for sampling. Chosen river stretches were sufficiently far apart to ensure use by different otters. At each stretch, six to eight otter marking places were chosen for scat collection. In winter of 2006, these sampling sites were surveyed at sunrise, for 5 consecutive days, assuring that sample collection was performed within 15 h from deposition by the otter. Otter scats are easily recognisable to the trained eye and are usually deposited by the otter in prominent places as marking activity for territory defence. Scats collected at the river stretches might be from the same individual, but scats from different river stretches are probably not. Among 119 scats collected, 31 were randomly selected on site and processed for microflora analysis (Table 1), being the remaining used in diet assessment and in the molecular identification of individual otters (data not shown). For each scat sample selected, an AMIES swab (FL medical) was immediately performed for bacteria identification and kept refrigerated until further processing. The remaining scat sample was kept frozen for viral detection.\n\n\n",

We aimed at investigating microbial diversity of the otter\u2019s faecal flora, as they are well spread in this country, being found in a wide range of aquatic environments. Although cultured-based methods applied for faecal bacteriological examination have several limitations (Leser et al. 2002), as there are no data available on the microbiota of the Portuguese otter, we have chosen not to apply selective media or to perform PCR-based analysis, which would restrict microbiota characterisation. Harmsen et al. (1999) have already stated that molecular biology methods are sometimes insufficient for characterisation of faecal bacteria and provide no information on viability of microorganisms. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that fastidious bacteria, like Mycobacterium sp., would be lost in our study and acid-fast staining does not provide accurate results. Further studies should address this pathogen, by PCR amplification.",

No association was found between diet and microflora. The distribution of the isolates should also be taken in consideration. Our study describes the cultivable aerobic and anaerobic spore-forming bacteria from 31 scats, and we do not believe that this sample size may be representative of the otter faecal flora, especially to differentiate between a fully established bacterial community and transient microorganisms.

The presence of antibodies against feline and canine virus was already referred by other authors (Kimber and Kollias 2000; Kimber et al. 2000) in river otters, indicating their susceptibility to viral infection. A vast number of pathogen sequences are available for amplification from faecal material (Kohn and Wayne 1997). None of the samples was positive for the viral nucleic acids tested in this work. CPIV, CAD1, CAD2 and CPV are eliminated in the stools and persist in the environment for long periods because of their resistance to adverse climatic conditions (Greene 1990). The negativity to all three viruses in the processed stool samples indicates that these animals were not excreting the virus at the time of collection. Infection by Parvovirus is more frequent in the beginning of spring and through out the summer (Greene 1990). The Adenovirus and Parainfluenza virus are ubiquitous, but their pathogenic impact is higher in populations with high animal density, which is not the case with the Eurasian otter, as they are solitary territorial animals. Further studies should investigate if this negativity is related to the time of collection, as the PCR inhibitors that are usually encountered in faeces (Kohn and Wayne 1997) were eliminated by the DNA extraction method. Amplification of short DNA segments (from 187 to 704 bp) also results in more consistent amplifications, eliminating the possibility of no amplification because of the fact that DNA in faeces is present in low copy numbers or degraded (Kohn and Wayne 1997). The success of DNA extraction was also improved by the collection of scats at sunrise, to assure their freshness.",
