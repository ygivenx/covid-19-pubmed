The disease classically presents in three distinct stages. The primary stage involves the formation of a genital chancre or ulcer, which is highly contagious. Around one-quarter of these cases go on to the secondary stage, which causes a range of symptoms including hair loss, fever, rashes, joint pains, and genital warts, which are also contagious. If left untreated, the condition can go on to the tertiary stage, which consists of chronic and severe neurological, and cardiovascular damage leading to death.3 Syphilis infection during pregnancy leads to foetal loss, stillbirth, neonatal disease, and long-term deformities.4 The highly contagious nature of the disease makes detection and treatment crucial.5 Treatment is with drugs of the penicillin group, which are widely available.",

The elimination of sexually transmitted disease (STD) was another. STDs were portrayed as a consequence of evil western influences, fitting perfectly with the patriotic fervour of the time.11 By 1954, a nationwide STD control programme had been introduced. Thousands of health workers were trained to recognise the signs and symptoms of STDs, screening was introduced, and free antibiotics were made widely available.8 Brothels were closed and prostitutes were incarcerated for compulsory re-education programmes. All this occurred against a background of prohibition of pre- and extramarital sex, in a country that was virtually closed to the outside world. By 1964, the Chinese proclaimed that syphilis had beeneradicated in mainland China.12 The successful campaign against STDs is one of the great public health successes in world history, showing how high-level political commitment, combined with community participation and health promotion, can eliminate a major disease.",

From 2000 to 2005, the incidence averaged 5.1\u20135.8 per 100,000 per year.16 The incidence has been consistently higher in men than in women but the gap had narrowed to around 1.3:1 in 1998 and has remained there.15 These figures compare with a syphilis incidence in the USA of 3 per 100,000 in 2005, up 11% from 2004, after an all-time low in 2000, with much of the increase in men who have sex with men (MSM).17 Other Asian nations, such as Thailand and India, are generally seeing a decline or little change in syphilis reports,18 although as elsewhere these almost inevitably underestimate the true incidence, because symptomatology can be non-specific, cases may be missed, and physicians (especially private practitioners) cannot be relied on to report.",

The prevalence in the low risk groups, which approximate the general population, were all below 1%: 0.3% in food and service employees undergoing routine employment examinations, 0.45% in women attending antenatal clinics, 0.66% in premarital examination attendees, and 0.37% in voluntary blood donors. Note that HIV prevalence in the general population is less than 0.1%.19 In high-risk groups, the prevalence was highest (14.6%) in MSM and incarcerated female sex workers (FSWs; 12.5%). Upward trends in these two groups were also highest, 1.4% increase per year in the incarcerated FSWs and 4.5% per year in MSM. It should be noted that the figure for incarcerated sex workers probably overestimates the figure for all sex workers in China, as FSWs who are arrested are more likely to be poor, uneducated street prostitutes. They are at higher risk of STDs than those working in brothels, massage parlours, and bars, who constitute the majority of FSWs in China.20, 21 The latter are more likely to adhere to safer sexual practices and are less likely to be arrested.22\n",

The rise in syphilis itself, of course, shows that there must be increased levels of partner exchange compared with those previously observed.34 The fact that syphilis peaks in individuals in their late 30s also suggests that this is the result of a partner exchange after marriage (around 95% of Chinese marry in their 20s).35 It has been observed in China that non-monogamous sex, and, especially paid sex, is far more common as an extramarital activity than a premarital one.34 The growth in the sex industry over the past two decades, and especially the acceptance of sex being sold in non-traditional venues, such as barbershops and karaoke bars, has particularly contributed to the spread of syphilis. The number of sex workers is estimated to have increased 10-fold over the past two decades to the current estimate of 3\u20134 million.19 There are also concerns that the sex industry will continue to grow because of the emerging problem of excess men,36, 37 which has resulted from a combination of the traditional Chinese preference for male offspring, the One Child Policy, and easy access to sex-selective technology.38 This has led to a sex ratio of around 117 male births to 100 female births per year, with around 20 million excess men of reproductive age in the next two decades,39 with increased demands for commercial sex almost inevitable.37\n",

For example, of 986 sexually active migrants in Shanghai only 14% had had more than one sexual partner and 31% had had premarital sex.40 A study among women in Hainan island showed 15% had had premarital sex but none had had extramarital sex,41 and a study among market vendors in Hefei, a large eastern city, showed 28% had had premarital sex.42 Other studies have shown higher figures. For example, 52% of those questioned in a study in rural Anhui Province had had premarital sex.43 Studies among university students show relatively low levels of sexual activity: a large study of students in Ningbo, eastern China, showed that 17% of men and 8% of women reported ever having sex.44 In Beijing, 14% of unmarried male students and 9% of unmarried female students had had sexual intercourse.45 A study among university students in Shanghai showed that 45% of the men and 27% of the women thought that premarital sex was acceptable.46\n",

This movement takes two major forms: migration on a long-term basis for work, and short-term travel predominantly for business and tourism. Since the late 1980s, the Chinese government started to lift travel restrictions so that rural peasants can move to the cities to find work. The number of rural\u2013urban migrants increased from 50 million in 1990 to 120 million in 2000, with an estimate of 160 million by 2010.48 It has been assumed that migrants are creating a demand for the sex industry and spreading STDs and HIV.19,38 Evidence from other countries shows that the sex industry thrives around communities of migrant workers who are predominantly men.49 But there is limited hard evidence that Chinese migrants are spreading STDs. Although some of the major receiving centres for migrant workers, such as Zhejiang and Fujian, have higher incidences of syphilis, not all do, and Guangxi, which is among the provinces with the highest incidence, receives very few migrants.48 The one study specifically to address this question of migration and syphilis was carried out in Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province. The prevalence of syphilis among migrants in the study was lower (0.48%) than in the urban population (0.68%). In addition, it was found that 48% of the migrants were women and 43% of all migrants had migrated with a partner.49\n",

This means that some of the most vulnerable do not seek health care, with syphilis sufferers left untreated, at risk of major health problems, and a source of its spread.51, 52 For example, a study carried out in a rural area outside Beijing found that 80% of women with genitourinary symptoms did not attend for health care partly because of fear of the cost and partly because of poor understanding of the importance of the problem.53 In addition, privatisation has led to varying standards of health care, especially in terms of diagnostics, so that untreated infection continues to spread in the community.51\n",

Given the current high prevalence in certain groups, notably MSM, FSWs, and IDUs, screening programmes could at the very least start there.54 However, given the illegal and stigmatized nature of these risk behaviours, offering free screening and treatment is not straightforward,55 and uptake would probably be patchy. As far as population screening goes, the Chinese have just foregone a good opportunity. Until October 2003, screening for syphilis was frequently included in the then compulsory premarital examination,35 and treatment had to be completed before the marriage could take place. As it became voluntary, the number of couples undertaking screening has dropped dramatically. It is just starting to be recognised that the premarital examination performed a very useful public health function for screening for disease and for health promotion in young adults, and one province (Heilongjiang) has re-introduced it in its compulsory form, with other provinces also considering this course of action. Others are expected to follow. Screening of pregnant women is obviously crucial because of the devastating effects of congenital syphilis. Free screening was introduced in Shenzhen and this has proved costeffective and sustainable,52 but it should be scaled up across the country.",

Given that the prevalence of syphilis is 10 times higher, the transmission easier, and the treatment effective, it seems extraordinary that it has been largely ignored in the huge programmes devoted to HIV. Many of these VCT centres are greatly underused at present, so to widen their remit to include syphilis could be done at low cost. This anomaly is not unique to China. It has been noted that in parts of sub-Saharan Africa individuals are treated for HIV while their syphilis is ignored.56\n",

Promotion of condom use, especially in high-risk groups must be a key message. This is important, all the more, for FSWs who have sexual contact with large numbers of men. Condom use varies across studies and among different types of sex worker, but \u2018always\u2019 condom use averages at around one-third across key studies.29,64,65 Pilot programmes of 100% condom use in Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces have demonstrated reductions in the prevalence of syphilis in FSWs,66 and these programmes could be scaled up across the country. The other group that must be targeted for condom use is MSM. In the context of HIV/AIDS, considerable efforts are being made to target MSM, especially in bars and clubs, but they remain a difficult group to access, and there are no published reports about effective means of increasing condom use in MSM in China.",
