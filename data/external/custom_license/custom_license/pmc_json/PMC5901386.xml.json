N-Terminal appendage (70 aa long) of human LysRS, which is known to interact with nonspecific tRNA in vitro, served as RID of human origin (hRID). For comparison, LysRS from E. coli (eLysRS; 57.6 kDa) or LysN (24.8 kDa) were also used (14). Expression vectors of wild-type (WT) hRID and RNA-nonbinding mutant hRID (hRIDmu) were constructed in 3 versions. The first mutant has 2 aa substitutions (K23A and K27A), the second mutant carries 6 substitutions with alanine (K19A, K23A, R24A, K27A, K30A, and K31A), and the third mutant contains 9 substitutions with alanine (K19A, K23A, R24A, K27A, K30A, K31A, K35A, K38A, and K40A). Subsequently, the HAgD, originating from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1) virus, was inserted between the KpnI and HindIII restriction sites to construct the hRIDmu-HAgD.",

First, the LysRS gene of the pGE-LysRS4 vector was deleted by means of restriction enzymes NdeI and KpnI. The genes of RIDs of human, murine, and rabbit origins were amplified by PCR, resulting in hRID, mouse RID (mRID), and rabbit RID (rRID); each was inserted into pGE-LysRS4 (separately). The RID4 expression cassette is composed of an RID, a D6 linker (hexa-aspartic acid sequence) to aid soluble expression, an alternating serine/glycine space linker, a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition cleavage site (ENLYFQ), a multiple cloning site (MCS; GTGSDIVDKL: KpnI/BamHI/EcoRV/SalI/HindIII), and a hexahistidine tag (6xHis) for nickel (Ni)-affinity purification, under control of the T7 promotor (23). HAgD cDNA of the PR8 (H1N1) strain was amplified by RT-PCR and was inserted between the KpnI and HindIII sites of the pGE-RID4 vector. All of the constructs were designed to yield 2 fragments\u2014RID and HAgD\u2014after cleavage with the TEV protease. hRID served as a template for mutagenesis of amino acid residues involved in RNA binding.",

As initial screening for soluble expression, a variety of fusion vectors\u2014pGE-LysRS (4), pGE-RID4, and pGE-LysN4\u2014was tested (Fig. 1A). LysRS, which is composed of LysN and a C-terminal domain, was derived from E. coli (Fig. 1B). LysRS of eukaryotic origin carries an extra N-terminal domain (RID) that is absent in the E. coli counterpart (Fig. 1B). As a target antigen, the HAgD of strain PR8 (H1N1), containing the receptor-binding site, was used (Fig. 1C, D). As an RID, the most N-terminal tRNA-binding domain of \u223c70 aa from LysRS was derived from each of 3 species\u2014humans, mice, and rabbits\u2014to obtain hRID, mRID, and rRID, respectively, and hRIDmu (Fig. 1B). In addition to RIDs, the LysN (amino acid positions 1\u2013220) and the whole LysRS from mice and rabbits were cloned as fusion partners for the soluble expression of HAgD and other test proteins. The fusion linker contains the ENLYFQ sequence for the site-specific cleavage by TEV protease, if needed (Fig. 1D). The schematic diagrams of HA trimers in the mature virion and of the recombinant RID-HAgD fusion protein are shown in Fig. 1E. According to some reports, the solubility of fusion proteins is somewhat influenced by the location of the fusion tag (28, 29). The N-terminal fusion of mRID increased water-soluble expression by \u223c30% compared with the C-terminal fusion (Supplemental Fig. 1B). In addition, the N-terminal fusion protein mRID-HAgD was eluted mainly in a trimeric form, whereas the C-terminal fusion protein HAgD-mRID was eluted at \u223c70% in a dimeric state (Supplemental Fig. 1D). Therefore, all fusion tags in this study were placed in the N-terminal part of target proteins.",

            "text": "Expression at lower temperature increased the solubility of the proteins (Fig. 2B\u2013F), in agreement with findings that the slowing down of translation enhances the proper folding and solubility of proteins (30). As a control, direct expression of GFP or bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) without fusion to an RID yielded predominantly a precipitate of insoluble aggregates under all of the temperature conditions tested (Fig. 2D). Initial screening of LysRS proteins for solubility revealed that the eLysRS had superb solubility compared with the counterparts of mouse or rabbit origin (Fig. 2A). Parallel analyses showed that the RIDs of all 3 species are produced predominantly in the soluble form (>95% for hRID and mRID and \u223c80% for rRID, respectively; Fig. 2B). Of note, the RID equivalent is absent in E. coli LysRS (Fig. 1B) and therefore, could not be tested. Thus, the RIDs of human and animal origins were further explored as a docking tag for potential soluble expression of target proteins: BMP2, GFP, and HAgD (Fig. 2D, E). As shown in Fig. 2E, unlike the HAgD without RID, HAgDs as a fusion to an RID of varied origin were expressed as soluble proteins with a good yield (20\u201340% of total protein). The solubility of all of the recombinant proteins was greatly enhanced (by \u223c5\u201340%) compared with direct expression without fusion (Fig. 2D, E). Overall, the expression of fusion partners of mouse origin (mRID, mLysN, mLysRS) was higher than the expression of fusion partners of rabbit origin, but their solubility levels were similar (Fig. 2A, C, E, F). Despite minor differences, each RID fusion showed a strongly increased total soluble yield of the respective proteins. Because there were no significant differences between LysN and an RID in promotion of the solubility of a reporter protein, RIDs were chosen as a fusion tag for the rest of the experiments: an RID of small size (\u223c8 kDa) is not expected to interfere physically with trimeric assembly of HAgD and as a docking tag, is less immunogenic than LysN (\u223c28 kDa) or LysRS (\u223c57.6 kDa; Fig. 2A\u2013C). Thus, mRID-HAgD and rRID-HAgD were chosen as immunogens for inoculation of mice or rabbits, respectively. In parallel, eGFP was used as a reporter for solubility as a fusion to RID, where its solubility ratio was \u223c50% at 25\u00b0C (Fig. 2G).",

According to the elution pattern, the RID-fused HAgD proteins were predominantly in the trimeric state, resembling the assembly status of the whole HA protein in an influenza virus. The estimated size of trimeric RID-HAgD (140\u2013144 kDa) is slightly bigger than the calculated value (40 kDa \u00d7 3 = 120 kDa). The flexible nature of the fusion junction and the elongated nature of the RID are expected to cause slight overestimation of the overall size of a fusion protein (17, 18) (Fig. 1E). SDS-PAGE analysis also confirmed that the bulk of RID-HAgD proteins was present in the trimer fraction. Apparently, the bound tRNAs dissociated and failed to be copurified with the HA proteins during the purification process, probably owing to relatively low affinity for RID (31). Serving as a control, mRID-eGFP was eluted at elution volumes 12.80 and 22.50 ml, indicating a mixture of oligomeric (\u223c30%) and monomeric (\u223c70%) conformations, with the estimated size of the monomer 34.2 kDa, close to calculated 37.8 kDa (Fig. 3A). eLysRS-HAgD (85.8 kDa) was eluted as a mixture of oligomeric (60%) and dimeric (40%; estimated as 181.97 kDa) conformations (Fig. 3B). According to the elution pattern, eLysRS-HAgD protein was a mixture of oligomers and the dimer in solution. The HAgD without RID, refolded from inclusion bodies (25.4 kDa), was eluted mainly as a monomeric conformation (Fig. 3C). The results showed the efficacy of the RID in promoting the folding and assembly of its reporter HA protein into the native trimeric conformation.",

Trimeric HA glycoproteins are responsible for binding of the influenza virus to sialic acid on the host cell membrane for initiation of the infection cycle. Fetuin is a glycoprotein that contains sialic acid and can be used in a convenient assay for evaluation of binding of a functional trimeric assembly of an HA protein (32). In this assay, the quality of HA folding could be assessed regarding receptor binding at the initial stage of viral infection. Our results showed that the E. coli-derived recombinant HA, which is not glycosylated, binds to fetuin (Fig. 3D), suggesting that glycosylation is not important for the folding of HA (33). Of note, the mRID-HAgD trimer manifested stronger binding than did monomeric HAgD (without RID) obtained by refolding (Fig. 3D). eLysRS-HAgD, which is predominantly in a dimeric form, failed to bind, as was the case for mRID-eGFP, which was thus selected for negative controls (Fig. 3D). Consistent with other reports (34), the receptor-binding activity of mRID-HAgD reflects its proper folding and assembly into the biologically relevant trimer conformation.",

All of these proteins were expressed in soluble form, purified by Ni-affinity chromatography, and subjected to SEC for the analysis of trimeric assembly. All 3 mutants showed enhanced solubility compared with the WT hRID-HAgD protein at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4C), although the solubility levels were not noticeably different at 20\u00b0C. All of these proteins were purified by 1-step Ni-affinity chromatography (Fig. 4D). Remarkably, SEC data revealed that as the number of mutations increased, the proportion of trimeric assembly decreased, with a corresponding increase in the amount of the oligomer in the void volume (Fig. 4E). These results strongly indicated that the interaction with RNA is indeed required for the assembly of the HA antigen into the immunologically relevant conformation.",

After immunization with an RID-HAgD or RID-eGFP fusion protein, antiserum was obtained, and an ELISA was performed to estimate the amount of a specific antibody against the docking tag and the reporter proteins, respectively (Fig. 5A\u2013F). ELISA data confirmed that immunization elicited robust antibody responses against target reporter antigen HAgD or eGFP but much less toward the RID docking tag. First, irrespective of the reporter protein, the ELISA signal was much stronger against fusion proteins than against the RID itself (for rRID, Fig. 5A, B for eGFP and HAgD, respectively; for mRID, Fig. 5C, E for the respective proteins). Second, for the same reporter antigen, the ELISA signal was much stronger for the reporter antigen regardless of the source of the docking protein (compare Fig. 5E with 5F for the HAgD and Fig. 5C with 5D for eGFP). Third, the same conclusions were drawn, regardless of the animal species to be immunized (compare Fig. 5A with 5B for rabbits and Fig. 5C\u2013F for mice). It should be noted that specificity of the antibody response to a reporter protein relative to the RID docking protein was not appreciably different regardless of the origin of an RID and the animal species to be immunized (compare Fig. 5A with 5D for eGFP and Fig. 5B with 5F for the HAgD), probably as a result of high homology (\u223c80%) in an amino acid sequence between the murine and rabbit counterparts. In contrast, data from the ELISA involving eLysRS-HAgD as an immunogen showed a similar magnitude of the responses to fusion proteins eLysRS and eLysRS-HAgD, suggesting that the immune response was directed predominantly against the eLysRS docking tag with a negligible response to the desired HAgD region (Fig. 5G). High immunogenicity of eLysRS may be because of low sequence homology of LysRS between the mouse and E. coli (\u223c36%). In addition, WB analysis was carried out to examine the binding specificity of the antibodies produced against recombinant proteins. After treatment with the TEV protease, the 6xHis tag and the peptides corresponding to the MCS were expected to be removed from an RID and RID-HAgD (Fig. 1D). Accordingly, the antibody against RID-HAgD bound specifically to the HAgD (cleaved) and RID-HAgD (remained uncleaved) but not to the RID docking tag alone (cleaved; Fig. 5A\u2013F and Supplemental Fig. 2A\u2013D).",

            "text": "The full-spectrum analysis of the antibody specificity is shown in WB data in Supplemental Fig. 2A\u2013E. The RID fusion tags, RID-eGFP and RID-HAgD, were digested with TEV, resulting in cleavage products of the expected size (Supplemental Fig. 2A). For convenience, protein fragments, with or without the His tag + MCS peptide moiety, are indicated with black and white arrows, respectively. rRID was detected by rabbit antiserum raised against rRID fusion proteins but failed to be detected after TEV treatment (Supplemental Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the positive detection, albeit a weak one, by WB was a result of the immune response to the His tag + MCS moiety, rather than to the self-rRID docking tag. To determine whether anti-histidine (His) tag antibodies raised against 1 protein could bind to the His tag attached to another (irrelevant) protein, we performed an additional WB analysis. Serum samples from rRID-HAgD-immunized rabbits showed an immunoreaction with the eGFP protein, and conversely, serum samples from mRID-eGFP-immunized mice showed an immunoreaction with the HAgD protein (Supplemental Fig. 2E). Given that only the His tag was a common region between rRID-HAgD and eGFP and between mRID-eGFP and HAgD, it is likely that the bands indicated by black arrows represent a specific interaction between the anti-His tag antibody and the His tag. Likewise, in rRID-eGFP or rRID-HAgD, the predominant response was directed against the eGFP or HAgD reporter proteins, rather than rRID. Likewise, mRID was weakly reactive with the murine antiserum against mRID-eGFP (Supplemental Fig. 2C), but the reactivity disappeared after TEV cleavage (white arrow), suggesting that the self-mRID was not immunogenic in mice. The lack of crossreactivity between mouse antiserum and rRID of rabbit origin was probably a result of high homology of RIDs between the 2 host species (Supplemental Fig. 2C, D). Therefore, the weak but distinct ELISA response to the RID docking tag (Fig. 5) is not actually a result of immunogenicity of the RID but of the peptides artificially introduced for affinity purification and cloning purposes. This finding indicates that the RID docking tag itself is nonimmunogenic, and the immune response was aimed predominantly at the desired viral antigen after immunization. The WB analyses, along with the ELISA, confirmed that RID can serve as an excellent enhancer of folding and assembly of a target antigen without compromising the specific immune responses.",

            "text": "Mice were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (102 PFUs) of the PR8 (H1N1) virus to obtain antiserum against the PR8 (H1N1) virus. Four weeks later, blood was drawn from each mouse via transorbital collection, and serum was prepared. All of the mice survived with a maximal weight loss of 23% by 7 d postchallenge (dpc) and recovered slowly. Furthermore, 2 wk later, blood was collected from the recovered mice, and the resulting serum was subjected to ELISA and WB analyses (Fig. 6A, B and Supplemental Fig. 3A). The results confirmed that RID-HAgD (trimeric form; Fig. 3A), as a coating antigen, was detected by highly diluted antisera from infected mice (n = 5), whereas the refolded HAgD without RID (monomeric form; Fig. 3C) was detected at a much lower dilution of the antisera (\u223c50-fold lower) than RID-HAgD was. The RID docking tag, as a negative control, failed to show any immunoreactivity (Fig. 6A, B). WB then confirmed that the antibody response was directed against HAgD, whereas RID, either before or after TEV cleavage, failed to react with the antiserum (Supplemental Fig. 3A). These results indicated that recombinant RID-HAgD may serve as a diagnostic antigen with high specificity and sensitivity for influenza infection. In addition, we compared ELISA reactivity among various antisera from mice infected with different subtypes of influenza strains. As expected, the highest reactivity was seen with the homologous PR8 (H1N1) antiserum (Fig. 6C). Potential crossreactivity with different HA antigens was examined using cold-adapted X-31-based reassortant strains carrying 6 internal genes from the cold-adapted X-31 virus and the genes encoding surface proteins HA and neuraminidase from WT viruses (35, 36). Lower reactivity was observed with heterologous virus New Caledonia (NC; H1N1) or heterosubtypes, including Panama (PA; H3N2), Indonesia (ID; H5N1), or Korea (KR; H5N2; Fig. 6C and Supplemental Fig. 3B). Alternatively, to test whether the antibody elicited by the RID-HAgD vaccine binds to the homologous PR8 (H1N1) virus, we conducted an ELISA with the antisera from mice immunized with mRID-HAgD or HAgD without RID (as a control; n = 5), by means of the PR8 (H1N1) virus as a coating antigen (Fig. 6D, E). The results confirmed that mRID-HAgD elicited specific antibodies against the homologous virus and that repeated boosts with the fusion protein further amplified the antibody response, suggesting that the quality of the recombinant antigen is immunologically relevant. Despite 3 immunizations, the antisera to the HAgD without RID rarely bound to PR8 (H1N1) viruses, indicating that the HAgD without RID could not induce antibody responses specific to the virus in mice (Fig. 6E). These results suggested that recombinant RID-HAgD may serve as a good antigen for accurate diagnosis of infection or quantification of vaccine antigens.",

The HI assay against the PR8 (H1N1) virus was carried out by means of antisera collected from the mice (n = 3) immunized with RID-HAgD (4 \u03bcg/mouse) or RID-eGFP (as a control, 4 \u03bcg/mouse), along with an Alum adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) via the intraperitoneal route. The mouse antisera against RID-HAgD showed detectable levels of HI titers and NT antibody titers, whereas those from the RID-eGFP group failed to show such an activity (Fig. 7B, C). The HI activity appeared to be similar, regardless of the origin of the RID docking protein. Therefore, with the use of mRID-HAgD (20 \u03bcg/mouse), HAgD without RID (15 \u03bcg/mouse), and PBS, detailed analyses of immune responses were conducted after prime-boost immunization (n = 5) via the intraperitoneal route (Fig. 7D, E). As shown in Fig. 7D, E, boost immunization with mRID-HAgD (20 \u03bcg/mouse) augmented the immune responses, and high HI titers (>32) were achieved by the second boost immunization, whereas the NT antibody levels (>103) correlated with the HI antibody levels. The multiple immunizations with the HAgD without RID did not generate HI or NT antibodies to the PR8 (H1N1) virus (Fig. 7D, E). Antisera from rabbits (n = 2) immunized with 1 mg of the rRID-HAgD recombinant vaccine (Fig. 7F, G) showed higher HI titers (>64) and higher NT antibody levels (>40) than those shown by mouse antisera (Fig. 7B, C). The control rabbit antisera against the RID-eGFP proteins or PBS showed neither the HI ability nor NT titers against the homologous PR8 (H1N1) virus (Fig. 7F, G). These results clearly showed that the RID-HAgD fusion proteins could be further optimized into effective vaccine antigens that can produce protective NT antibody responses against influenza viruses.",

Initially recognized in HIV infections (10), the chaperna activity is intrinsic to some ribozymes (7, 8) and probably operational during the folding and homeostasis of normal cellular proteins (37, 39). Whether a chaperna operates in combination with molecular chaperone proteins during the de novo folding of proteins remains an exciting possibility. Nonetheless, the variety of guest proteins that are amenable to RNA-dependent folding is not yet known, and the identity of RNA molecules among the RNA-interacting proteins is not well documented. A convenient avenue for exploiting the chaperone activity of RNA for the folding of difficult-to-express proteins is to use RIDs that interact with known, identified RNA molecules for fusion with target proteins (14, 15).",

The influenza HA antigen could be produced in bacteria as a soluble trimeric structure that can induce the production of NT antibodies for effective protection against a lethal challenge. As revealed during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the supply of sufficient doses of vaccines within a short period is a prerequisite for mitigating the economic effect and addressing public health concerns during a pandemic. Previously, all efforts toward the bacterial production of recombinant HA vaccines have been dependent on the chemical refolding of misfolded insoluble aggregates (34, 40\u201343). All of these processes have depended on the initial production of HA as insoluble aggregates and required subsequent chemical refolding procedures, involving solubilization with chaotropic agents, dilution, and concentration before an immunologically relevant conformation was obtained. Therefore, the production of immunologically relevant antigens in mammalian or insect cells in baculovirus vector systems has been favored. Nevertheless, these systems invariably require cell culture methods that are highly expensive and difficult to scale up. The production of HA in a soluble, trimeric conformation should greatly simplify the production process, ensuring the quality of the resultant vaccines and making them amenable to implementation of pandemic preparedness (43).",

            "text": "In the proposed system, an RID serves as a docking tag for transducing the chaperone function of RNA for the folding and assembly of the downstream reporter protein (HA) via interaction with resident cellular tRNAs. From the functional perspective, the coupled action of this chaperone during protein folding and assembly is similar to that of chaperone proteins (44, 45). Our results also indicate that the RIDs that were derived from various animals can be used as immunologically tailored, antigen-folding vehicles for antigens, which could serve as diagnostic and prophylactic tools for viral infections. In addition to the de novo folding of monomers, the subsequent assembly of monomeric antigens into multimeric-ordered structures is crucially important, especially for augmentation of the immune response and proper presentation of epitopes by immune cells toward protection (12, 13). Therefore, a judicious choice of an RID is required; while mediating the chaperna function, the docking tag should not physically interfere with the formation of oligomeric structures. In the present study, an N-terminal-appended tRNA-interaction domain (18) of a eukaryotic LysRS was chosen as the RID. This domain is small (\u223c70 aa long) and belongs to the family of intrinsically unfolded domains; it is expected to be sufficiently flexible so that it does not physically interfere with the trimer assembly of HA located downstream (46). Intrinsically, the influenza HAgD proteins were expressed and purified predominantly as trimers (Fig. 3A). Although the expression levels and solubility of eLysRS-HAgD containing eLysRS as an alternative tRNA-binding domain were substantially higher, the fusion protein existed primarily as a dimer, as confirmed by gel-filtration chromatography under native conditions (Fig. 3B). Possibly, the stabilization energy of dimerization of the relatively large LysRS (\u223c57.6 kDa) may physically interfere with the trimerization of HAgD (\u223c25.4 kDa) (47). Therefore, despite high immunogenicity, as demonstrated by an ELISA (Fig. 5G), immunization failed to provide protection against a lethal challenge (Fig. 8C, D). However, the HAgD, without an attached RID protein, yielded interesting results when administered to mice. Even without eliciting antibody responses, three immunizations with the HAgD without RID partially protected the mice from the lethal challenge. We assume that this partial protection may be because of the T cell-mediated immunity against HA. There are several reports indicating the existence of T cell epitopes in the HA of influenza viruses (48\u201350). It is likely that multiple immunizations with the HAgD without RID induced specific T cell responses, contributing to the protection. The results emphasize the importance of the assembly of antigens in a native conformation for induction of protective NT antibody responses. The process has distinctive advantages over the chemical refolding of insoluble aggregates (42, 43, 51), which require solubilization with chaotropic agents, dilution, and concentration before adopting an immunologically relevant conformation. The production of the HAgD with a receptor-binding domain in a soluble, trimeric, immunologically activating conformation should ensure the quality of viral antigens and make them amenable to implementation of pandemic preparedness (52\u201354).",

The existing approaches involve fusion of HA with ferritin into nanoparticles or with a foldon that is derived from the natural trimerization domain of isoleucine zippers or T4 fibritin (55\u201358), wherein the major amount of stabilization energy is provided by the external trimerization domain. In the present approach, using a chaperna, the RID remains an independent monomer, and thus, it is not expected to contribute to intermolecular stabilization among HAgDs. Rather, trimer formation is primarily driven by the intrinsic stabilization energy of mutual interactions among HAgDs. Here, an RID, as a small, structurally independent domain, is not expected to interfere with the interactions within HAgD trimers in space, as governed by the thermodynamic stabilization energy in the assembly of trimers.",

The RID that was used in this study is relatively unfolded, and therefore, the linking of the docking protein with the RID may increase its solubility, in agreement with other reports (14, 59). Therefore, it is intriguing that the hRIDmu2, hRIDmu6, and hRIDmu9 proteins maintained high solubility (even higher than that of the WT hRID; Fig. 4C), and yet, the extent of the trimeric assembly of HAgD was greatly lowered (Fig. 4E).

Molecular chaperones are proven to be crucial for not only the de novo folding but also, the assembly of monomers into multimeric complexes (44, 45). Moreover, in contrast to the foldase type of molecular chaperones, which consume ATP for recycling chaperones from docking proteins, a chaperna is expected to function as a chaperone without the ATP requirement, in a way similar to that of the holdase type of chaperones (60\u201362). Here, the affinity of RNA may be a determining factor for the capture and folding of the guest proteins. In addition, the potential effect on the tRNA-induced \u03b1-helical structural transition of an RID to folding of the downstream docking protein should be investigated further. Overall, our results show that RNA can affect the kinetic landscape of the folding pathway in favor of the productive folding and assembly of vaccine antigens (37, 63).",

We recently confirmed that the present strategy can be successfully applied to the assembly of bacterially synthesized monomers of a norovirus particle, which comprises 180 monomers, into virus-like particles (VLPs; unpublished results). However, in VLP assemblies, prior cleavage of the RID tag was required to enable the compact packing into VLPs. This system may also be applied to preparation of mAb for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Basically, the process involves isolation of spleen cells from an immunized mouse, followed by their fusion with immortalized cells and screening of reactive clones. In this case, an RID, originating from the host being immunized (murine or rabbit origin in this study), was used to ensure that most of the positive antibody clones were directed to the target antigens, for instance, the spike protein of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (unpublished results).",
