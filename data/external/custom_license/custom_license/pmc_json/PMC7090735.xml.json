            "text": "Keratinocyte growth factor 2 (KGF-2), also known as fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10), is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which includes a minimum of 23 related peptides. The protein sequence and biological function of KGF-2 are similar to that of KGF-1, or fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF-7) [1]. KGF-2 is produced by fibroblasts of the dermis, the granulation tissue, and the intraepithelial \u03b3\u03b4T cells; it acts specifically on cells of epithelial origin, including skin keratinocytes, and intestinal epithelial cells, by binding to FGF receptor 2-IIIb (FGFR2-IIIb) [2, 3]. The accelerating effect of KGF-2 on the rate of re-epithelialization in various animal models has been demonstrated [4\u20136]. Furthermore, KGF-2\u2019s protective properties against radiation and oxidative stress have also been demonstrated in recent studies [7, 8]. These preliminary data undeniably suggests KGF-2 as a promising candidate for the treatment of epithelial damage. Currently, KGF-2 is already being used in clinical trials for the treatment of venous ulcers [9] and oral mucositis, a severe oral ulceration induced by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Large scale production of this promising therapeutic protein is demanded.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, high quality therapeutic proteins require rapid and efficient strategies for protein expression and purification. Currently, fusion protein technology is an effective way to achieve the goal by enhancing expression, decreasing the proteolytic degradation, improving solubility, and facilitating purification of the recombinant proteins [10, 11]. Despite the current advancements in fusion protein technology, it is still burdened with flaws. Most of the fusion systems produce non-native N-terminal amino acids during the cleavage process of the fusion tag, which may lead to serious effects on the biological activities of many proteins. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family proteins are present in all eukaryotes but absent from prokaryotes. Sumoylation has crucial roles in regulation of gene expression, control of nucleocytoplasmic signaling, and faithful replication of a large and complex genome [12, 13]. SUMO fusion system could overcome the problems described above, and has been used to facilitate efficient expression and purification of several proteins in E. coli [14, 15]. The relative ease of maturation of SUMO fusions allows the target protein to be isolated using a standardized purification procedure; and the properties of the SUMO hydrolase, which recognizes the tertiary structure of the SUMO tag, allow the target protein to be produced with a completely native sequence. Butt et al. [16] have observed that 100 SUMO fusions have been isolated without cleavage within the partner protein. SUMO fusion system has also been successfully applied to some difficult-to-express proteins including matrix metalloprotease (MMP13), and SARS-CoV proteins [14, 15].",

            "text": "KGFs have been expressed in different systems. Luo et al. [17] have used GST-fusion technology and high MgCl2 concentration to improve expression level of KGF-1 in E. coli. Laird et al. [18] have observed that only the trunked form of KGF-2 was robustly expressed in a protease-deficient E. coli host. Recently, Wang et al. [19] demonstrated that recombinant human KGF-2 could be expressed in a yeast strain Pichia pastoris. However, the targeted protein with a molecular weight of 19.3 kDa had a significantly lower expression in the supernatant of transformants, induced in normal conditions, than a peptide with molecular weight of 17 kDa, which is speculated to be the degraded product of recombinant human KGF-2. This result suggests that the recombinant human KGF-2 may be susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Therefore, here we attempt to use a hexahistidine-SUMO fusion strategy for expression and purification of recombinant human KGF-2 in E. coli, aiming at decreasing the chance of proteolytic degradation, enhancing expression and simplifying purification of the target protein with Ni-NTA chromatography.",

Second, hKGF-2 gene fragment (F2) was obtained from pET3c/hKGF-2 (constructed in our laboratory) plasmid using P3 and P4 as the primer pair.

The expression level of target protein induced at 0.4 mM of IPTG was comparable to that induced at 0.6, 0.8 and 1 mM, and higher than that induced at 0.2 mM (data not shown).
