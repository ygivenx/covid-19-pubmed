The most commonly used control measures against IBV infection in the world, including Brazil, are based on the combination of biosafety and immunoprophylactic programs. In Brazil, IBV vaccination is performed since the early 80\u2019s and the Massachusetts serotype is the only one approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Supply [2]. Different laboratories produce IBV vaccines containing the H120 viral strain, which are attenuated after going through 120 passages in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. The Ma5 strain was introduced in Brazil in the early 90\u2019s, and it was obtained from an essentially pure culture of the Massachusetts serotype. Despite the systematic vaccination in Brazil, IB has not yet been controlled efficiently and diseases associated with IBV have also been reported in vaccinated chickens [3\u201310].",

The main reason for that is the lack of a proofreading mechanism by the RNA polymerase during viral RNA replication, resulting in a heterogeneous progeny [11\u201313]. When high-performance genomic sequencing shows two or more nucleotide peaks on the chromatogram for the same position, this information can be used to identify any variance in the viral RNA genome within an isolate [14\u201316]. Furthermore, the ambiguous heights of these peaks can be used to identify predominant and minor viral subpopulations in the same isolate [17, 18]. The spike glycoprotein S1 binds the virus to the host cell and it contains important epitopes that induce the formation of neutralizing antibodies [5].",

Our goal was to find answers for the following questions: (i) Are the IBV strains in the vaccines genetically homogenous and generate viral subpopulations? (ii) Are the vaccines against IBV genetically stable? To address these questions, we performed DNA sequencing of S1 gene in IBV vaccines from different manufacturers. We investigated the presence of viral subpopulations in all vaccines and also between two consecutive batches of the same vaccine. Additionally, we investigated the presence of viral subpopulations in each vaccine after a single passage in chicken embryonated eggs.",

An evidence for this is the frequent identification of IBV strains in the poultry in Brazil, mostly in vaccinated poultry farms, in which viral strains are isolated from clinical cases of infectious bronchitis disease [6\u201310].",

IBV vaccine strains from the same serotype that exhibit differences in the S1 gene sequence and are manufactured by different laboratories may present features that point to the original virus seed strain selected to produce the vaccine, as well as the number of passages performed in embryonated chicken eggs to attenuate the virus. However, it was not clear how IBV vaccines produced from the same virus seed by different manufacturers could exhibit important genetic variability and differences in the S1 gene sequence. Therefore, to investigate that, we performed a single additional passage of each H120 viral strain vaccine in embryonated chicken eggs, which is the same standard procedure used by manufacturers. Our results showed that after viral reisolation, two of the four commercial vaccines exhibited differences in the S1 gene sequence compared to the original vaccines. For instance, vaccine C exhibited a minor viral subpopulation that was detected as a secondary nucleotide peak in the original vaccine but it turned out to be even as a predominant subpopulation after reisolation. On the other hand, a new viral subpopulation emerged in the vaccine A after reisolation since a secondary nucleotide peak was detected at the 366 position; however, the original vaccine A did not contain any viral subpopulations in that position.",

This clone selection was based on the HRM results, in which selected clones exhibited different melting profiles for the same amplicon compared to the original Ma5 vaccine. The minor viral subpopulation initially identified in the chromatogram analyses of the S1 gene sequence due to the presence of a secondary nucleotide peak at the position 125 was not confirmed by HRM analyses, suggesting that perhaps its DNA melting profile might be very similar to the original Ma5 vaccine.
