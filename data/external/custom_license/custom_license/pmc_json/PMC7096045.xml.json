Sometimes people contact us because they have a disease that they have been studying for many years, and they have reached a belief that there's an infectious basis. Those may be a long shot: for example, a chronic disorder like multiple sclerosis. In the other scenario, the evidence that there's an infectious basis is already clear. And there, it's just a question of whether we have the time and the resources to pursue it.",

We've been following examples from the peak of the outbreak to the time that it waned. We've found that there's a lot more swine flu at the peak of the outbreak, but, as it wanes, we begin to see rhinoviruses and other forms of flu. As you do this kind of work it becomes clear that clinical syndromes are often not specific, and the laboratory has a very important role to play. One of the advantages of the multiplex PCR systems that we use is that we can consider a wide variety of hypotheses. We don't step in with any bias, and, as a result, we're constantly surprised at the versions of these microorganisms and the fact that so many of them present in a similar way clinically.",

At noon, I had a meeting with some chemical engineers about ways we can make sequencing instruments that are smaller, more sensitive and more robust. Then, later in the afternoon, I have meetings to go over recent data in a number of different viral discovery projects. There's a reovirus that's affecting farmed salmon, a picornavirus that's affecting turkeys and then a whole host of human syndromes\u2014basically they are too numerous to count.

What we elected to do with the LuJo virus, because we had been told that efforts to identify the agent had been unsuccessful, was to simply get the material and place it into high-throughput sequencing and identify the gene products. What's remarkable about this is that when we began using this approach a couple of years ago, the time required was several weeks. But, in this instance, we only needed 72 hours. We were able to identify so many different genetic fragments, and, with those footholds in place, we rapidly filled in the remainder of the genome.",

But even then, to get the full sequence of the virus, it took an army of people over a week. So, in contrast, we did not grow the LuJo virus in culture. We took the material directly from a clinical specimen, and, essentially, after a little bit of amplification, we placed the sample into the sequencer, and we were able to identify this new virus with a fraction of the cost, a fraction of the effort and a fraction of the time. So it really was a paradigm shift in terms of what you can do. I think the other lesson here is that anyone can do this. If we can export this technology to the developing world and develop the expertise that's required to use it, I think we're going to be able to make diagnoses at the source.",

We have a mandate as a WHO collaborative center to train people in the use of these sequencing technologies. So, what we do\u2014and it's our privilege to do it\u2014we bring people in for a period, sometimes it's just a few days, other times it's as much as several months, and they learn how to work with these tools. At this point, we've trained over 50 people from over 20 countries. More and more people are becoming conversant with this approach, so I'm very optimistic that this is going to make an enormous difference in terms of global health.",

Then, when SARS emerged in 2003, everyone thought that was going to be a novel strain of flu.

Obviously, we can't find them all, but what we can do is look at those animals that we come into contact with most. We need to start characterizing these animals and get some idea of what viruses they harbor. We have projects [monitoring] bats, [for example, which] harbor a wide range of important pathogens including rabies virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Marburg virus, Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus. There are very few viruses that are restricted to humans, and, as long as we have animal reservoirs, I don't see how many vaccine strategies are going to succeed.",
