PoRV belong to the genus Rotavirus in the family Reoviridae [14], which can infect pigs of all ages, especially piglets, and cause diarrhea and vomit dehydration. Since it was first isolated from swine waste in 1974, PoRV has become a global epidemic these days [7]. Even though some genes in PoRV genome can limit the host selection, some animal rotavirus is likely across host barrier to infect humans, seriously affecting the health of the human intestine. A previous study of rotaviral strains circulating among Brazilian children provided the evidence of transmission of RVC from swine to human [4].",

The S protein is the structural surface potein of PEDV which has a high antigenic index and can induce neutralizing antibodies.

Besides, PoRV VP7 gene (49\u20131017 nt) and PEDV S gene (1471\u20132415 nt) were predicted to be dominant antigen genes using DNA star software. Therefore, the VP7 gene (49\u20131017 nt) of PoRV and the S gene (1471\u20132415 nt) of PEDV become the targets of the co-expression of eukaryotic plasmids. Besides, Linker engineering is important for construction of recombinant fusion proteins which can adopt loop conformation to relax the intramolecular strain between the two half-molecules [12, 24]. In this study, Linker engineering was introduced between PoRV VP7 gene and PEDV S gene. Bioinformatics analysis found that the basic biological activities of VP7 gene and S gene in fusion gene kept unchanged, which indicated that linker would not affect the protein structure and biological function. Then, we successfully constructed PoRV VP7 gene (49\u20131017 nt), Linker engineering, and PEDV S gene (1471\u20132415 nt) co-expression recombinant plasmid pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S.

The results showed that eliciting powerful and long-lasting humoral and cellular immune response can be induced in vaccinated mice. The immune effect of intramuscular injection was better than subcutaneous injection. This phenomenon could be due to the structure of muscle cell, belonging to multinucleated cells that have plenty of sarcoplasmic reticulum and the transverse tubular system containing extracellular fluid, and deeply wear into the muscle cells [2]. So muscle cells are suitable for the intake and expression of DNA. The levels of PEDV and PoRV IgG in mice serum of high dose group (200 \u03bcg) were significantly higher than that of middle (100 \u03bcg) and low (50 \u03bcg) dose groups (P < 0.05). IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and T lymphocyte proliferation induced by high-dose group were higher than middle- and low-dose groups. The results confirmed that compared to 100 \u03bcg and 50 \u03bcg, the immune effect of 200 \u03bcg pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S was better.

The results showed that three kinds of adjuvants induced high levels of the PoRV and PEDV specific IgG, and the IFN-\u03b1 exhibited best activity. The levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 and Spleen lymphocyte proliferation of three kinds of adjuvants were significantly higher than those of intramuscular injection group (P < 0.01). The effect of IFN-\u03b1 as vaccine adjuvant has been discussed a lot over the years. IFN-\u03b1 can exert its antiviral effect by stimulating the body to produce anti-viral proteins and inducing the body to produce adaptive immune response to eliminate invading pathogens. Meanwhile, IFN-\u03b1 associates with the production of antibody. It is reported that IFN-I is the necessary signal of B cell differentiating into plasma cell. Although there lack of evidence of IFN-I can produce antigen specific B cells, B cells cannot be further activated and produce neutralizing antibody [10]. Cheng G et al. found that IFN-\u03b1 induced strong induction of FMDV-specific neutralizing antibody and significant T cell-mediated immune responses through IFN-a as an adjuvant for a recombinant FMD protein vaccine [3]. The ability of IL-12 to induce protective immunity through enhancing proliferation of T cells and NK cells, increasing cytolytic activities of T cells, NK cells, and macrophages, activating T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and inducing production of IFN-\u03b3 and other cytokines [13]. Transfer factor can activate T lymphocytes and enhance the cellular immunity and humoral immunity. Wang R et al. found that transfer factor of pig spleen could increase cellular immunity function through inactivated porcine parvovirus oil emulsion vaccine by co-inoculating porcine transfer factor in mice, which had wide development value as immune adjuvant [20]. With the restricting of antibiotics, transfer factor will have advantage of epidemic disease preventing and curing on livestock and poultry.",
