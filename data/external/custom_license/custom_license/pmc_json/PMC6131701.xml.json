            "text": "It has been well established that many\nbiological processes can be regulated independent of transcriptional\nor translational changes through post-translational modification (PTM)\nevents. Indeed, kinase-mediated phosphorylation of proteins, in which\nkinases catalyze the transfer of the \u03b3 phosphate group from\nATP to the hydroxyl group of a specific Ser, Thr, Tyr residue, is\namong the most thoroughly characterized PTM. Virtually all cell signal\ntransduction events are regulated by kinases independent of biological\ncomplexity of the host (i.e., prokaryotes and eukaryotes).3 Lending further credence to the biological importance\nof kinases, >500 kinases have been identified in the human genome,\nand \u223c30% of the human proteome is modulated by kinase-mediated\nphosphorylation events.4,5 Thus, considering the central\nrole of kinases in a broad range of cellular processes (including\ngrowth and development, metabolism, and immune responses), it has\nbeen postulated that the activities of individual kinases may represent\nmore reliable predictors of cellular phenotypes than transcriptional\nor translational changes.6 Indeed, transcriptional\nor translational-based OMICS approaches are often unable to account\nfor regulatory events including gene silencing, mRNA stability, translational\nefficiencies, protein turnover, enzyme/substrate subcellular sequestration,\nor protein activation/repression PTMs.7 Given the central role of kinases in the regulation of biological\nprocesses, kinases are a logical drug target. As a testament to this,\n33 kinase inhibitors have been granted licensure by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) for a broad range of malignancies, and\nthere are a continually increasing number of kinase inhibitors that\nare in various stages of preclinical trials. Furthermore, kinases\nare the second most frequently targeted gene class in cancer therapy\nafter the G protein coupled receptors.8,9 The recent\nprioritization for the repurposing of approved therapeutics for alternative\nmalignancies by the National Institutes of Health Center for Advancing\nTranslational Sciences (NCATS)10,11 also provides considerable\nimpetus for the investigation of licensed kinase inhibitors as infectious\ndisease therapeutics. Concerns exist regarding the therapeutic application\nof kinase inhibitors as novel therapeutics for infectious disease,\nin particular to the potential immunosuppressive effects following\nprolonged treatment. However, it should be appreciated that the application\nof kinase inhibitors in such cases would need to be targeted in terms\nof timing and dose, with appropriate molecular biomarkers guiding\ninitiation and cessation. It should also be appreciated that the clinical\nsymptoms associated with many emerging and re-emerging pathogens have\nbeen associated with dysregulated host immune responses (in particular\npro-inflammatory responses).",

In addition,\nkinome investigations may offer important, and predictive, insight\ninto the cellular mechanisms that regulate phenotypic changes within\ncells.7 As many kinases recognize a particular\nphosphorylation motif composed of the central phosphoacceptor site\nand the amino acids +4 and \u22124 residues from the central phosphorylation\nsite,12 peptides representing this kinase\ntarget motif can be synthesized with relatively high efficiency and\nlow expense. Indeed, kinase target motif peptides have been shown\nto be appropriate substrates for their respective kinases with Vmax and Km values\napproaching those of the full-length protein.13 Thus, peptide kinome arrays can be constructed in an analogous manner\nto traditional DNA microarrays where kinase target motif peptides\nare spotted onto a glass slide representing hundreds to thousands\nof unique peptide targets for kinases (Figure 2). Following this, samples in the form of\ncellular lysates from whole organs, tissues, or individual cell types\ncan be applied to the kinome peptide arrays, allowing for the phosphorylation\nof specific peptide targets by kinases within the lysate (Figure 3). The development\nof kinome-specific bioinformatics analysis software, including the\nPlatform for Intelligent, Integrated Kinome Analysis (PIIKA), has\nprovided a mechanism to identify the complex patterns of kinase-mediated\nphosphorylation events and quantitate the differences between compared\nconditions.14,15",

To address this, host kinome analysis was performed on\nCongo Basin and West African MPXV-infected human monocytes, a host\ncell targeted by orthopoxviruses.70 As\nthe genomes of both MPXV clades demonstrate considerable diversity\nin the regions coding host response modifier proteins, and in particular\nin genes associated with anti-apoptotic activities, it was postulated\nthat the virulence differences of the two MPXV clades may be related\nto differential modulation of host cellular responses.

As a consequence, regional outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging\npathogens can have deleterious effects on global stability. Thus,\nit is prudent that a concerted effort is employed to assimilate data\nthat bridge both clinical and molecular information in investigations\nof these pathogens. These efforts will not only provide considerable\ncontext in regard to the molecular events that potentiate clinical\nmanifestations of pathogenesis but also better inform the design and\nimplementation of novel therapeutics. To this end, global analyses\nof host molecular responses can provide considerable insight into\nthe complex molecular events that underlie cellular responses. Indeed,\ntranscriptome analyses have provided important information regarding\nhost transcriptional responses during emerging and re-emerging pathogen\ninfection. These investigations often provide critical insight into\nthe kinetics of host immune responses during the course of infection\nas well as mechanistic information regarding the cellular intermediates\ninvolved in these processes. However, the role of PTMs in the regulation\nof these events cannot be captured by traditional transcriptome technologies.\nIn particular, the role of kinase-mediated regulation of cell signaling\npathways has remained poorly understood. Given the central role of\nkinases in the regulation of cellular processes (e.g., homeostasis,\nmetabolism, proliferation, and stress responses), it is of inherent\nimportance that future investigations also address the role of the\nkinome in the cellular response to pathogen insult. Furthermore, kinomics\nalso provides a mechanism for the identification of novel therapeutic\ntargets based on the direct assessment of the activation state of\ncell signaling pathways. For example, pro-inflammatory responses during\nearly stages of infection, and in particular the dysregulation of\nspecific cytokines or cell signaling events that contribute to these,\nmay represent potential therapeutic targets in the early stages of\nhigh-consequence viral pathogen infection. However, the selection\nof immunomodulatory therapeutics that target these dysregulated host\nresponses is complicated by the regulatory events (i.e., kinase-mediated\ncell signaling events) that occur upstream of changes in gene expression.\nIn addition, mRNA is subject to a variety of regulatory processes\n(including gene silencing, mRNA stability, translational efficiencies,\nprotein turnover, enzyme/substrate subcellular sequestration, and/or\nprotein activation/repression PTMs). Thus, from the standpoint of\ntherapeutic discovery, the sole reliance on technologies for the global\ninvestigations of host responses that do not account for these regulatory\nprocesses or the role of PTMs in the modulation of cellular responses\ncould impede the identification of efficacious therapeutics.",

From the\nperspective of this review, kinome investigations have identified\nseveral therapeutic targets and licensed kinase inhibitors that have\nimpaired viral replication in vitro and reduced the severity of disease\nin vivo (Table 1).\nFor example, it has been demonstrated that the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR\nsignaling pathways have a role in viral propagation during MERS-CoV\ninfection.37 Indeed, licensed kinase inhibitors\nthat targeted these pathways (i.e., everolimus, selumetinib, and trametinib)\nresulted in decreased viral replication in vitro when added prior\nto, or following, infection. Furthermore, the pharmacologic inhibition\nof PI3K and PKC following EBOV infection provided partial protection\nin a lethal model of EVD in mice.59 It\nshould be noted that although the modulation of an individual kinase\nmay have suppressive effects on infection (i.e., viral replication),\nthis might not provide the level of inhibition required to completely\nnegate viral escape.

For example,\nin silico prediction of viral protein phosphorylation sites provides\na mechanism for the construction and, ultimately, the annotation of\nviral protein PTMs that are critical to the viral life cycle. Furthermore,\nthe use of kinome peptide arrays has extended beyond the human kinome\nand now extends to a variety of animal species.75\u221277 It has been\nsuggested that the interspecies phenotypic variability may reflect\ndifferences in phosphorylation sites found within the proteome.77 Thus, the development of species-specific kinome\npeptide arrays provides additional utility for kinome analysis as\npeptide arrays representing traditional laboratory animal species\n(mouse, guinea pig, nonhuman primate) can be employed to detail the\nspecies-specific host response. The results from such analyses, and\nthe overlap between these and those described previously from the\nanalysis of human infections, may inform the selection of appropriate\nanimal models that meet regulatory approval through the FDA Animal\nEfficacy Rule.29",
