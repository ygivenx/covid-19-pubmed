            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease that began in Guandong, China in November 2002. It has caused serious infections in many nations, such as Asia, Europe and Canada.1\u20136 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortality of patients afflicted with SARS is 15% on average and 50% or higher in patients aged 65 years and over.7 SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped and positively single-stranded RNA virus with a typical genome size of 29.7 kb. It encodes RNA-directed RNA polymerase and structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.8\u201311 The N protein is a 422 amino acids alkaline protein with a short lysine-rich region suggested as the nuclear localization signal. It plays an important role in the process of virus particle assembly by enveloping the entire genomic RNA.12 The SARS-CoV N protein is a major pathological determinant in the host and might cause host cell apoptosis, upregulate the proinflammatory cytokine production, and block innate immune responses. Moreover, the N protein of the SARS-CoV is an important antigen for both the early diagnosis of SARS and the detection of diseases.13 Since SARS broke out in 2003, researchers have made great efforts to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for its early diagnosis.14\u201318 In addition, due to its essential role in SARS replication, the SARS-CoV N protein is mainly regarded as a prime target for anti-SARS therapy. For this reason, the SARS-CoV N protein is an attractive and crucial target for anti-SARS therapeutic drug discovery.",

The QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide was confirmed on a 2.5% agarose gel at 100 V in TAE buffer. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed a band with mobility having a different band pattern between the free QDs and the QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide, which confirmed the formation of QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide. The mobility shifts were compared (data not shown). On agarose gel, the QDs-conjugated RNA oligonucleotide showed a lower mobility shift than free QDs, thus demonstrating the amide formation between QDs and RNA oligonucleotide for conjugation.",

Among the polyphenolic compounds screened, (\u2212)-catechin gallate and (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate showed high anti-SARS-CoV N protein activity. The chemical structures of (\u2212)-catechin gallate and (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate are shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows our elucidation of (\u2212)-catechin gallate; (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate showed high inhibition activity in a concentrated manner against SARS-CoV N protein. (\u2212)-catechin gallate and (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate, at 0.005 \u03bcg mL\u22121 or more, concentration-dependently attenuated the binding affinity as evidenced by QDs-RNA oligonucleotide on the designed biochip (Figure 4A and B). At a concentration of 0.05 \u03bcg mL\u22121, (\u2212)-catechin gallate and (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate showed more than 40% inhibition activity on a QDs-RNA oligonucleotide biochip platform. As shown in Figure 4A and B, (\u2212)-catechin gallate and (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate showed a similar pattern when comparing the concentration-dependent anti-SARS activity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of (\u2212)-catechin gallate and (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate were found to be approximately 0.05 \u03bcg mL\u22121, respectively (Figure 4A and B). Other polyphenolic compounds to the inhibition of SARS-CoV N protein on the nanoparticle-based RNA oligonucleotide biochip system were detected as nearly similar to the background signal, due to the high affinity with the QDs-conjugated aptamer-SARS-CoV N protein (data not shown). To perform high-throughput screening of the inhibitors, it would be efficient to be able to measure the anti-SARS activity from optical images of a biochip containing multiple reaction compounds. To demonstrate the feasibility of the inhibitor assays, the latter were carried out on a biochip within 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C, and optical images were obtained from the reaction mixtures on a plate using a QDs-based imaging system. The inhibition of the anti-SARS activity from (\u2212)-catechin gallate and (\u2212)-gallocatechin gallate were clearly illustrated, and dose dependency was distinctly observable in the optical images.",

The discovery of anti-SARS agents has been of considerable interest in developing an efficient and effective methodology for high-throughput screening. Our main goal in this study is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept that SARS-CoV N protein can be inhibited and detected with remarkable simplicity and speed. Regarding its application, this designed platform for a novel inhibitor assay possesses significant potential as a target screening. In particular, it is a promising method for inhibitor screening because of its high sensitivity, low cost, rapid response, compatibility for miniaturization, and low labor-intensity. In addition, this platform is expected to be applicable to the inhibitor screening of other types of diseases.",
