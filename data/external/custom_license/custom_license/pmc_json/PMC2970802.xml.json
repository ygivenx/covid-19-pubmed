NoVs are divided into five genogroups, GI to GV, of which GI and GII strains mostly affect humans [21].

ORF-1 codes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and ORF-2 and -3 encode the two structural proteins VP1 and VP2 [10].",

In comparison, the method described in Fig. 1a, panel C, yielded a ten times lower amount of NoV capsid VLPs. The purity of the VLPs obtained by each method was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE and staining of the proteins with PageBlue (Fig. 1b). 1 \u03bcg of the total protein was loaded into each lane. Each method resulted in equally pure protein bands corresponding to the size of the NoV capsid. Residual PEG present in the VLPs, concentrated by PEG dialysis, may have interfered with the protein concentration determination, and this could explain the lower capsid protein concentration observed (Fig. 1b, lane A). NoV capsid identity and antigenicity of the VLPs were assayed by western blot using human NoV-specific convalescent sera (Fig. 1c). The results show pure NoV capsid proteins without degradation and with similar antigenicity for each of the purification methods. Next, we determined the morphological integrity and homogeneity of the VLPs by EM (Fig. 1d). The VLPs obtained by purification with sucrose density gradients followed by dialysis and either ultrafiltration (Fig. 1d, panel B) or ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1d, panel C) were approximately 38 nm in size, with the classical appearance of NoV capsid VLPs. By contrast, CsCl purification (Fig. 1d, panel D) and concentration of the VLPs by dialysis against PEG (Fig. 1d, panel A) resulted in VLPs of heterogeneous size, which appeared broken and aggregated. The VLPs purified and concentrated by the method schematically presented in Fig. 1a, panel B, were of the best quality and were subjected to further analysis.",
