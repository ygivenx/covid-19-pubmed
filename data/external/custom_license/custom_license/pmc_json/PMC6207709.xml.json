However, there are significant differences between humans and mice, such as T-cell and B-cell signaling pathway components, Th1/Th2 differentiation, Toll-like receptors and cytokines and their receptors.1 To overcome these problems, various humanized mice in which the human immune system can be studied in vivo have been recently developed.

However, these humanized mice are still insufficient because the developed human cells are not fully functional. For example, although immunization of these humanized mice with antigens leads to the production of antigen-specific IgM, antigen-specific IgG responses are very weak.5,6 T-cell differentiation, such as generation of CD4 and CD8 single-positive T cells, seems to be relatively normal in these humanized mice.5,7 However, the function of these T cells, especially induction of antigen-specific T-cell responses, remains controversial.4 One of the reasons is thought to be mismatches between mouse MHC and HLA of donor human HSCs. To overcome these issues, new immunodeficient Il2r\u03b3\nnull mouse strains that express human HLA class I or class II molecules were generated and showed HLA-restricted antigen-specific CTL responses8 or antigen-specific IgG responses.9\n",

We previously reported that human PBMCs could be engrafted in NOG mice much better than in other immunodeficient mice.11 However, because of severe xenogeneic graft versus host disease (xeno-GVHD) in these mice, there is a limited window for experimentation. All the engrafted T cells are activated by xeno-GVHD, and all the mice die of xeno-GVHD, which makes it difficult to analyze human immune responses precisely. Previously, murine class I MHC and class II MHC-knockout NSG mice were developed and analyzed for xeno-GVHD,12 but the phenotypes and immune responses of transferred human PBMCs have not been clearly evaluated yet.",

NOG mice were established as previously reported.2 NOG-dKO mice were established as follows. B6;129-H2-Ab1tm1Doi (Iabnull) and NOD.Cg-Prkdc\nscid\nB2m\ntm1Unc/SzJ (NOD-scid B2mnull) mice were a kind gift from Dr Mathis D. of Harvard Medical School and Dr Shultz L. of The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), respectively. Iabnull mice were first backcrossed into C57BL/6JJic mice more than seven generations. The established B6-Iabnull mice were further backcrossed into NOG mice with a speed congenic technique combining a marker-assisted selection protocol and in vitro fertilization to obtain NOG-Iabnull mice. NOG-B2mnull mice were also established by backcross-mating NOD-scid B2mnull to NOG mice to introduce the Il2rg gene. NOG-dKO mice were obtained by mating NOG-Iabnull and NOG-B2mnull mice. For genotyping NOG-B2mnull mice and NOG-Iabnull mice, 3 different primers were used for detection of WT and KO genotypes. The primers used to detect the \u03b22 microglobulin (B2m) gene and I-ab gene were as follows: B2m gene, PI (B2m forward)=5\u2032--3\u2032, PII (B2m reverse WT)=5\u2032--3\u2032, and PIII (B2m reverse Mu)=5\u2032--3\u2032; I-ab gene, PI (Iab forward)=5\u2032--3\u2032, PII (Iab reverse WT)=5\u2032--3\u2032, and PIII (Iab reverse Mu)=5\u2032--3\u2032. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tails of the mice. The PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 94 \u00b0C 5 min/94 \u00b0C 30 s\u201360 \u00b0C 30 s\u201372 \u00b0C 60 s (35 cycles)/72 \u00b0C 10 min. A 676-bp band was detected for mutant B2m from the PI and PIII primer pair. A 488-bp band was detected for wild-type B2m from the PI and PII primer pair. A 587-bp band was detected for mutant Iab from the PI and PIII primer pair. A 335-bp band was detected for wild-type Iab from the PI and PII primer pair. The absence of MHC class I molecule expression in NOG strains (H-2Kd and H-2Db) on the surface of cells from NOG-dKO mice was confirmed by FACS (Supplementary Figure 1). Mouse care and all experimental procedures were performed under pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the established guidelines of Keio University and Central Institute for Experimental Animals. For generating human PBMC-transplanted mice, human PBMCs were collected from healthy volunteers with informed consent using Lymphoprep (AXIS-SHIELD PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) and were injected into mice intravenously (5 \u00d7 106/mouse).",

However, severe GVHD has been an obstacle for long-term follow-up and precise evaluation of the function of the T cells. We evaluated whether NOG-dKO mice can be used as a mouse model for T-cell-based adoptive cancer immunotherapies. We implanted 526 mel, a human melanoma cell line expressing MART-1,16 a human melanoma antigen, and HLA-0201, in NOG mice and NOG-dKO mice and treated them with MART-1-specific T cells (MART-Ts), which were generated by transducing the HLA-0201-restricted MART-1-specific TCR gene into activated PBMC-derived T cells from healthy human volunteers15 (Figure 5a). The NOG-dKO mice showed anti-tumor effects induced by MART-T administration with no body weight loss (Figures 5b and c). Co-administration of exogenous human recombinant IL-2 prolonged the survival of T cells with higher MART-1/HLA-A2 tetramer-positive cells and enhanced the anti-tumor effects in NOG-dKO mice (Figures 5d and e). Although the NOG mice showed stronger anti-tumor effects along with increased transfer of T cells, probably due to strong T-cell expansion via xenogeneic GVHD responses, the ratio of MART-1-specific T cells in the CD8+ T cells was smaller than that in NOG-dKO mice, suggesting that T-cell phenotypes were modified by xenogeneic GVHD responses in NOG mice (Figure 5e). Next, we treated human melanoma-bearing NOG-dKO mice with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In NOG-dKO mice, administration of cultured tumor infiltrating T cells, TIL217 cells (Figure 5f), showed significant anti-tumor effects against an autologous melanoma cell line, Mel2, which was established from the same patient from which the TIL2 cells were established (Figure 5g). CD271 on human melanoma cells, which is reported to be induced by IFN-\u03b3 and involved in suppression of melanoma-specific CTLs,18 was found to be increased in TIL2-treated melanoma cells (Figure 5h), suggesting that NOG-dKO mice might also be used for evaluation of changes in human cancer phenotypes induced by T-cells following immune interventions.

In this study, we showed influenza HA-specific IgG production in hPBMC-NOG-dKO mice vaccinated with HA antigen, suggesting that even with little inflammation caused by xeno-GVHD reaction, B-cell responses can be induced. Lack of xeno-GVHD in our mouse models enables more long-term and precise evaluation of human B-cell characteristics and responses. For example, the observation of B cells homing to the bone marrow (BM) almost 3 months (long-term) after human PBMC transfer in NOG-dKO mice (Figure 2e) is of interest. The mechanism of human B-cell homing to the BM and generation of memory B cells could be analyzed using our mouse models.",

In these models, the xeno-GVHD reaction stimulates transferred T cells, alters their phenotypes and masks the real anti-tumor effects. Actually, in our experiment, transferred MART-1-specific T cells were preferentially expanded in NOG-dKO mice compared with NOG mice (Figure 5e). The effector phase of anti-tumor immune responses in which anti-tumor T cells recognize and kill tumor cells can be evaluated more precisely and for a longer period in our NOG-dKO mouse models than in NOG mouse models because of the lack of xeno-GVHD. In particular, T-cell phenotypes, such as anergy or exhaustion, might be effectively evaluated. Our colleagues have recently reported that immunotherapies targeting PD-1 could be more precisely evaluated in our NOG-dKO mice than in NOG mice because the xeno-GVHD reaction induces nonspecific T-cell activation accompanied by PD-1 expression in NOG mice.31 On the other hand, because of the short longevity of antigen presenting cells, our current mouse models may not be suitable for evaluation of the induction phase of anti-tumor immune responses if DCs are not supplied, as shown in Figure 4. A variety of immune cells, such as macrophages, MDSCs, Tregs and NK cells, which play important roles in the cancer microenvironment, are also not well supported in our current mouse models. For supporting these cells, we are now developing various human cytokine-producing transgenic NOG strains.32\n",
