            "text": "\nNidovirales is a large order of enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that consists of the families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae, whose members infect a broad range of hosts including humans and other mammals, birds, fish, insects, and crustaceans [10, 38, 47, 51]. Although the genome sizes and virion morphologies of nidoviruses are strikingly different, the genome organization and replication strategy are comparable across the order. The nidovirus genome is composed of two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, encompassing the 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the viral genome that encode non-structural proteins (nsps) and the remaining ORFs located in the 3\u2032-proximal genome part that code for structural proteins [25, 50]. The initial translation from replicase ORF1a and ORF1b yields large polyprotein (pp) precursors, pp1a and pp1ab, via a \u20131 ribosomal frameshift (RFS), which then undergo autoproteolysis by viral proteases to eventually produce functional nsps, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [3, 47, 59]. The membrane-bound RdRp-containing replication complex engages in viral genomic RNA replication and subgenomic (sg) mRNA transcription. The latter finally generates a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set of sg mRNAs that are used to express nidoviral structural proteins [25, 49, 50].",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a pathogenic macrophage-tropic arterivirus of swine that results in reproductive failure in pregnant sows and acute or chronic respiratory illnesses in pigs of all ages. PRRSV primarily replicates in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and can establish persistent infection in lymphoid tissues of infected pigs that lasts for several months. As a result, PRRSV infection suppresses normal macrophage function and immune responses and is often associated with severe disease outcomes, including increased pre-weaning mortality in growing pigs resulting from secondary bacterial or viral infections, thereby affecting the swine production system [17, 37, 49]. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a pathogenic enterocyte-tropic swine coronavirus that causes acute enteritis with high mortality rates in neonatal piglets. PEDV infection is characterized by severe villous atrophy in the small intestine that results in watery diarrhea followed by fatal dehydration and death in newborn piglets [27, 45]. Although PEDV outbreaks have been reported in Europe and Asia, the most serious epizootics for nearly the past three decades have occurred in Asia. However, since the virus first emerged in the United States in 2013 [52], PEDV has become recognized globally as a highly contagious and deadly virus. These two viruses, PRRSV and PEDV, represent emerging and re-emerging porcine nidoviruses that continue to threaten pork-producing countries around world, leading to huge financial losses to the global swine industry [20, 27].",

            "text": "Lipid rafts, which are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and associated proteins, are unique liquid-ordered microenvironments in the plasma membrane and are involved in a variety of cellular processes as well as in multiple stages of the virus life cycle. Cholesterol, a major constituent of lipid rafts, maintains the tight packaging of sphingolipids, and several proteins are partitioned into these microdomains. Cholesterol depletion destroys this structural order, leading to disorganization of lipid raft microdomains and dissociation of bound proteins [2, 22]. Therefore, plasma membrane cholesterol plays important roles in the infection processes of various non-enveloped and enveloped viruses [5, 34, 36, 56]. In particular, enveloped virus entry requires cholesterol in either the viral or cellular membrane or both [1, 4, 13, 15, 16, 35, 43, 57, 62]. However, there are few reports on the potential relationship between cholesterol and the replication of porcine nidoviruses, although cellular membrane cholesterol has been shown to be a determinant of PRRSV entry in African monkey kidney MARC-145 cells [21, 55]. In the present study, therefore, we investigated the requirement for cholesterol and its mechanism of action in porcine nidovirus infection. Independent depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of target cells by treatment with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) significantly impaired PRRSV and PEDV infection. These inhibitory effects on viral replication were partially reversible by replenishment with exogenous cholesterol. In contrast, porcine nidoviruses were shown to be resistant to pharmacological reduction of the cholesterol content of the viral envelope. Our data indicate that cholesterol-enriched microdomains are essential for PRRSV and PEDV in the cellular membrane, but not in the viral membrane. Further experiments revealed that pharmacological depletion of cellular cholesterol primarily interferes with virus binding and penetration and subsequently influences post-entry stages of the PRRSV and PEDV replication cycle, including viral genomic and sg RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and virus production. Altogether, our results suggest that cholesterol in the cellular membrane is critical for porcine nidovirus entry and that disruption of the cholesterol-dependent entry process may be an excellent therapeutic option for nidovirus infection in human or veterinary subjects.",

To examine the effect of M\u03b2CD on porcine nidovirus replication, PRRSV and PEDV were selected because they are economically important viral pathogens in the pork industry. Based on MTT assay, none of the doses of M\u03b2CD tested in the current study caused detectable levels of PAM-pCD163 or Vero cell death (Fig. 1A). PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells were pretreated with M\u03b2CD at concentrations of 0.5 to 2 mM or with ethanol as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection. M\u03b2CD or vehicle was present throughout infection. Virus production was initially measured by monitoring cytopathic effect (CPE) after infection and then confirmed by immunofluorescence using the respective anti-N protein MAb at 48 hpi (Fig. 1B). In vehicle-treated control cells, visible CPE appeared at 24 hpi (data not shown) and became predominant by 48 hpi, and virus-specific staining was pronounced in many cell clusters, indicating infection and spread of the viruses to neighboring cells. In contrast, M\u03b2CD had an obvious inhibitory effect on porcine nidovirus propagation. As shown in Fig. 1B, the cholesterol-sequestering compound dramatically diminished virus-induced CPE (first and fourth panels) and expression of PRRSV and PEDV genes in a dose-dependent manner. Based on the quantification of N protein by flow cytometry, the proportion (%) of virus-infected cells was noticeably reduced after M\u03b2CD treatment. A maximum of ~80% inhibition of both viruses was observed in response to 1.5 mM M\u03b2CD (Fig. 1C and D). In addition, the effective doses for inhibiting 50% (ED50) of the replication of PRRSV and PEDV were determined to be about 770 \u03bcM and 820 \u03bcM, respectively. Taken together, these data show that cholesterol depletion of target cells efficiently suppresses the replication of porcine nidoviruses.\n",

As shown in Fig. 2A, viral cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in M\u03b2CD-treated viruses compared to those in vehicle-treated viruses. However, in contrast to depletion of cellular cholesterol, the removal of cholesterol from virions resulted in no significant reduction in the replication of PRRSV and PEDV, even at the highest concentration used (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the titers of both PRRSV and PEDV remained unchanged upon treatment of each virus with M\u03b2CD (Fig. 2C).

To accomplish this, cholesterol-depleted cells were treated with 100 \u03bcg or 40 \u03bcg of exogenous cholesterol per ml, which is the highest noncytotoxic concentration for PAM-pCD163 or Vero cells, respectively, before virus inoculation. Both M\u03b2CD and exogenous cholesterol were supplied throughout the course of infection. The addition of exogenous cholesterol to M\u03b2CD-treated and virus-infected cells was found to significantly reverse the antiviral activity of M\u03b2CD through depletion of cellular cholesterol. Incubation with M\u03b2CD alone greatly reduced PRRSV production to 12% and 5% at 1.5 mM and 2 mM, respectively, whereas supplementation with exogenous cholesterol enhanced virus production to 32% and 23% at the same concentrations of M\u03b2CD (Fig. 3A). Likewise, although PEDV infection declined to 48%, 19%, and 2% in the presence of M\u03b2CD alone at 1 mM, 1.5 mM, and 2 mM, respectively, virus production increased to 59%, 26%, and 10% at the same concentrations of M\u03b2CD when exogenous cholesterol was added (Fig. 3B). To verify these results, we also investigated alterations in cellular cholesterol content in cells treated with M\u03b2CD and exogenous cholesterol using a fluorescent filipin III. Cellular cholesterol levels specifically decreased in virus-infected and M\u03b2CD-treated cells compared to those in virus-infected and untreated cells. Supplementing exogenous cholesterol distinctly elevated the cholesterol level in virus-infected and M\u03b2CD-treated cells (Fig. 4). Altogether, the data reveal that cellular cholesterol content plays a pivotal role in porcine nidovirus infection.\n\n",

Moreover, production of both viruses was diminished in M\u03b2CD-treated cells incubated at 37 \u00b0C to allow virus entry to proceed, which suggested that cholesterol sequestration disturbs internalization of PRRSV and PEDV. In addition, we analyzed the amount of pCD163 or pAPN expressed on the cell surface after M\u03b2CD treatment and found that the surface expression level of the viral receptor in cells treated with 2 mM M\u03b2CD was similar to that of on vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 7).

Early nidoviral translation produces the replicase polyproteins that are proteolytically processed into nsps, which subsequently drive de novo synthesis of nidoviral RNA. Therefore, we focused on the post-entry phases of the viral life cycle to investigate the functional mechanisms of sequestration of cellular cholesterol in PEDV infection. Because nidoviral infection generates genomic and sg RNA species, we first tested whether the removal of cellular cholesterol specifically affected genome replication and sg mRNA transcription. For this purpose, relative levels of both genomic RNA and sg mRNA were assessed by quantitative real-time strand-specific RT-PCR in the presence or absence of M\u03b2CD following porcine nidovirus infection. As shown in Fig. 8A, M\u03b2CD almost completely inhibited the synthesis of PRRSV genomic RNA and sg mRNA at a concentration of 2 mM when compared to untreated infected cells. Furthermore, an analogous effect of M\u03b2CD on genome replication and sg mRNA transcription of PEDV was observed. Little PEDV genomic RNA and sg mRNA was detected in cells treated with 1.5 mM M\u03b2CD (Fig. 8B). The decreases in viral RNA levels caused by M\u03b2CD did not reflect nonspecific inhibition of transcription because the internal control (\u03b2-actin or GAPDH) mRNA level remained unchanged in all samples (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that treatment with M\u03b2CD subsequently suppressed synthesis of nidoviral genomic RNA and sg mRNA.\n",

The expression levels of PRRSV and PEDV N proteins in the presence or absence of M\u03b2CD were evaluated at 48 hpi by western blot analysis. Pharmacological depletion of cellular cholesterol had a detrimental effect on nidoviral protein translation (Fig. 9). Densitometric analysis of the western blots revealed that the intracellular expression of both N proteins was dramatically reduced by M\u03b2CD, with a maximum of more than 95% inhibition at the highest concentration (Fig. 9).

Research on porcine nidoviruses is necessary not only for developing strategies to control these viruses in pig populations but also for understanding the molecular biology of human or veterinary-important nidoviruses. Despite extensive attention and research investment, two porcine nidoviruses, PRRSV and PEDV, continue to plague pig-producing countries, causing a significant economic impact on the swine industry worldwide. This is partially attributable to the lack of efficient vaccines that can confer full protection against nidoviral infections and the lack of antiviral agents to treat these infections. Although cholesterol is required for optimal infectivity of diverse non-enveloped and enveloped viruses [48, 56], its contribution to and specific function in porcine nidovirus replication are currently unknown. The present study showed that pharmacological sequestration of cholesterol in the cellular membrane but not the viral envelope exerts an efficient antiviral effect against PRRSV and PEDV in vitro. This effect could be counteracted by the addition of exogenous cholesterol, indicating the importance of membrane cholesterol for porcine nidovirus infection. Depletion of cellular cholesterol using the drug M\u03b2CD primarily affected the virus attachment and internalization stages, significantly affecting post-entry steps in the replication of porcine nidovirus. Altogether, our data indicate that cellular membrane cholesterol plays a critical role in entry of PRRSV and PEDV into target cells.",

            "text": "Because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, they have evolved elaborate relationships with their host cells and developed the ability to modulate lipid composition, lipid synthesis, and host cell signaling pathways [6]. In particular, cholesterol-rich microdomains appear to be important in the entry of various viruses. Indeed, many viruses have been shown to exploit cholesterol, which is present in either the viral envelope [22, 54], cellular membrane [4, 36], or both [40, 48], for maximal virus entry. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that cholesterol is an essential component in the life cycle of several nidoviruses. The depletion of cellular cholesterol inhibits the entry of coronaviruses, including mouse hepatitis virus [12], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [32], human coronavirus 229E [42], and avian infectious bronchitis virus [22] as well as arteriviruses, including equine arteritis virus [41] and PRRSV [21, 55]. On the other hand, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and canine coronavirus require cholesterol both in the target cell membrane and in the viral envelope [43, 44]. The current study revealed that PRRSV and PEDV are sensitive to the depletion of cholesterol only in the cell membrane. Although cholesterol depletion has been shown to inhibit PRRSV entry into African green monkey kidney-derived MARC-145 cells, whether plasma membrane cholesterol is involved in either virus attachment or penetration or both is unknown [21, 55]. In the present study, we used a continuous PRRSV-permissive PAM cell line that is considered the primary cell target for PRRSV in the natural host, making it a good system for studying virus-host interactions [31]. In a previous study, Yin et al. [61] suggested that cholesterol is critical for a post-adsorption step in the entry of TGEV, another porcine alphacoronavirus. Porcine CD163 and APN have been shown to confer permissiveness of non-susceptible cell lines to PRRSV and PEDV, respectively, and have been identified as key molecules in the entry of porcine nidoviruses [9, 31, 39]. A previous report showed that cholesterol depletion did not alter CD163 expression in MARC-145 cells [21]. Likewise, the present study indicated that pharmacological depletion of cellular cholesterol had no effect on the levels of pCD163 and pAPN expression in porcine cells. Recent studies have indicated that APN is not a functional cellular receptor for PEDV, suggesting that the presence of the authentic virus receptor is essential for viral entry [33, 46]. Therefore, it is still possible that cellular cholesterol is quantitatively related to a hitherto unidentified receptor for PEDV. Based on our results, nevertheless, we propose that cellular cholesterol is important in both the binding and internalization stages of PRRSV and PEDV entry into susceptible cell lines. These findings are striking in that these two viruses are known to use different cell entry mechanisms for the initiation of virus infection: PRRSV enters PAM cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by pH-dependent fusion between viral and endosomal membranes [60], whereas PEDV enters target cells via virus-receptor interactions, followed by direct pH-independent fusion of the viral and plasma membranes [27].",

            "text": "Because cholesterol is an essential lipid component of cell membranes, its depletion has the potential to inhibit virus entry via several mechanisms. Cholesterol is a critical structural component of lipid rafts, together with sphingolipids. These lipids influence viral infection by regulating viral and/or cellular membranes and thus can function by preferentially partitioning into specific membrane microdomains [6]. Cholesterol may affect virus entry by modifying interactions between virus particles and host cell membranes, and lipid recognition by certain viral constituents may be essential for virus entry [58]. In the case of SARS-CoV, cholesterol in the plasma membrane plays an important role in interactions of the viral spike protein and cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 for optimal infection [16]. By analogy, it is feasible that cellular cholesterol depletion might disturb binding of PRRSV and PEDV to specific cellular receptors. Secondly, the level of cholesterol is important for maintaining biological membrane fluidity, and its removal could reduce the potential for lateral diffusion in the membrane [7]. This reduction in membrane fluidity could have an influence on the entry of PRRSV and PEDV. Thirdly, the lipid environment, including the cholesterol level, is known to contribute to the charge of ion channels formed in cellular membranes [11]. Considering this issue, ion channel alterations in response to the lack of cellular cholesterol may affect the entry process of porcine nidoviruses. Lastly, cholesterol removal has been shown to result in the inhibition of cellular signaling pathways [53]. We previously found that PRRSV and PEDV activate specific intracellular signaling networks such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade pathways to favor replication of these viruses, but these signaling pathways are irrelevant to virus internalization [24, 28\u201330]. Based on these previous data, cellular cholesterol does not appear to act through MAPK signaling pathways. Although our analysis did not provide clear evidence of the mechanism by which cholesterol promotes porcine nidovirus entry, we assume that the mechanism may differ among viruses and that cholesterol-dependent virus entry might be dependent on more than one of the aforementioned pathways simultaneously.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our findings indicate that optimal infectivity of porcine nidoviruses requires cholesterol in the plasma membrane and that this is critical for the entry of PRRSV and PEDV. However, cholesterol depletion resulted in a reduction, but not abolishment, of virus infectivity, indicating that virus entry may still occur with lower levels of cholesterol but that increased cholesterol content makes this process more efficient. Future work should address the question of whether cholesterol facilitates PRRSV and PEDV entry through interactions between viral attachment proteins and cellular receptors and/or by affecting membrane fluidity. The current study indicates that cellular cholesterol is a key player in the early stages of porcine nidovirus infection, including attachment and penetration. Impeding porcine nidovirus entry is a viable antiviral strategy because it likely acts on extracellular targets, thereby limiting cell damage, and these viruses might be used as surrogate models for testing antiviral agents against human nidoviruses. Although further studies based on in vivo assessments are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the cholesterol-depleting agent M\u03b2CD, the results presented here indicate that molecules or drugs that interfere with cholesterol function in virus entry should be considered candidates for antiviral approaches to porcine nidoviral diseases.",

The virus-infected cells maintained at 37 \u00b0C were further treated with proteinase K at 37 \u00b0C. The infected cells were then serially diluted and plated onto fresh target cells. At 2 days post-incubation, internalized viruses were titrated by IFA and plaque assay for PRRSV (A) and PEDV (B), respectively. The results are expressed as the mean values from three independent experiments performed in triplicate, and error bars represent standard deviations. *, P = 0.001 to 0.05; **, P < 0.001",

Viral protein expression was quantitatively estimated by densitometry and expressed as the density value relative to that of the \u03b2-actin gene, and M\u03b2CD-treated sample results were compared to those of the vehicle control.
