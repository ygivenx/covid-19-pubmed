            "text": "The episomal vector pREP-SEAP is based on the vector pREP-7 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the removal of RSV promoter and the introduction of reporter gene SEAP. In short, the RSV promoter was removed from pREP-7 by digestion with XbaI and PvuII. A 0.3-kb XbaI-PvuII fragment from pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen) containing the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal was ligated to the XbaI-PvuII vector fragment of pREP-7 to block the expression from cryptic upstream promoters. This plasmid was designated pREP-bghpA. The gene encoding a secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was excised from pSEAP2-Basic (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) by digesting the plasmid with NotI and SalI and ligating the 2.0 kb fragment containing the gene into NotI- and SalI-digested pREP-bghpA to form pREP-SEAP. To construct HSV-1 promoter plasmids, DNA fragments containing the ICP4 and ICP22 promoter/leader region were amplified by PCR and cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The plasmid pAA3, containing the ICP4 and ICP22 genes, was used as a template. PCR was performed using primer 8834 (5\u2032-GGT ACC CCA GAA AAC GTC CCG GAG-3\u2032) and primer ICP4B5 (5\u2032-GGT ACC CGA GCG TCT GAC GGT CTG TCT C-3\u2032) at 55 \u00b0C. The 1208 bp PCR fragment, containing the regulatory sequence of ICP22 and ICP4 promoters with opposite orientation, was inserted into the KpnI site of the pREP-SEAP. As a result, there are two types of reporter plasmids. The resulting plasmid with SEAP driven by ICP22 was named pICP22. The pICP4 contains SEAP, which is driven by the ICP4 promoter (Figure 1). To construct the intron-deleted mutant promoter, primer 9104 (5\u2032-GAC GTT CCC CCG TGC AAA AAA GGC GG-3\u2032) and primer ICP4 B5 were used. The resulting plasmid with SEAP driven by ICP22 promoter without intron was named as pICP22-ID. The pICP4-ID has SEAP reporter driven by the intron-less ICP4 promoter. The map of plasmids is summarized in Figure 1. The Egr-1 expression vector pJDM948 was a generous gift provided by Dr Jeffery Milbrandt at Washington University in St Louis, MO, USA. The plasmid pH4-2, based on pUC19, contains the Hind III restriction fragment (non-prototype structure) covering the entire long and short internal repeats. This plasmid contains the genes of ICP4, ICP0, and LAT (latency-associated transcripts). Plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used as a control for transfection.",

Similar experiments were performed to test the regulatory effect of Egr-1 on the neighboring gene ICP22. The SEAP reporter assays indicated that Egr-1 repressed the activity of full-length ICP22 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B). A similar reduction of activity was observed for the ICP22 promoter without intron (ICP22-ID).

These results indicated the in vivo interaction of Egr-1 with the ICP4 promoter. Additional ChIP studies using the antibody against Nab2 (a known co-repressor of Egr-1) showed that the recruitment of Nab2 to ICP4 promoters was increased in the presence of Egr-1 (Figure 6).

In EBV, Egr-1 can be induced by EBV lytic transactivator Zta, suggesting a role of Egr-1 in the EBV reactivation 10. Tatarowicz et al.\n12 indicated that the EGR proteins are rapidly induced by stimuli that also induce HSV-1 to reactivate from latency. The authors also showed that Egr-2, but not Egr-1 and -3, inhibited the transcription of HSV-1 LAT, which represents the only major transcript during latency. These studies suggested that EGR proteins are involved during the reactivation from latency. However, the effect of Egr-1 on HSV-1 IE genes was not shown. The present study indicates that Egr-1 negatively regulates ICP4 and ICP22 transcription, and thus may have a role in the establishment of latency. It is likely that Egr-1, but not other EGR proteins, exert negative effect on these promoters upon infection to cause viral gene silencing. It is also possible that the use of our model system, which involves circular plasmids associated with chromatin, may have contributed to uncovering this novel regulatory mechanism.",

A recent study demonstrated that Nab2 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling/deacetylase complex and inhibits transcription 7. These results prompted us to hypothesize that Nab2 may participate in the Egr-1-mediated repression of HSV-1 IE genes. Results shown here suggest that Nab2 was recruited to the IE promoters in the presence of Egr-1. Although the intron is located closer to the transcription initiation site of ICP22 promoter than the ICP4 promoter, Egr-1 induced a greater repressive effect on ICP4 transcription. It is likely that repression of the more distant ICP4 promoter by Egr-1 relies on the chromatin remodeling complex associated with Nab2. More experiments to test this hypothesis are under way.",

There are 10 Sp1 elements in the regulatory region between ICP4 and ICP22 25. ChIP assays demonstrated that the binding of Sp1 to full-length ICP4 promoter was not altered by the presence of Egr-1. However, studies with pICP4-ID in which the intron was removed from the promoter showed that Egr-1 greatly reduced the Sp1 occupancy, indicating that Egr-1 displaced the binding of Sp1. It is possible that Egr-1 changed its binding from EBEs to the Sp1 sites when the intron was removed. Previous study indicated that binding of Egr-1 to the LAT promoter inhibited the binding of TATA-binding proteins (TBP), and thus represses transcription 12. TBP has been shown to interact with Sp1 26 suggesting the possibility that Egr-1 reduced the participation of TBP at the ICP4 promoter via Sp1 displacement. Overall, these results indicated that Egr-1 can modulate the binding of Sp1 to HSV-1 promoter and the repression of ICP4 and ICP22 expression may be in part owing to the dislocation of Sp1 and TBP.",

Second, the binding of Egr-1 recruited co-repressor Nab2 to the proximity of promoters and caused gene silencing, possibly via chromatin remodeling.
