Keystone, CM, MD, MSc (TM London) died at 76 years of age on September 3, 2019, surrounded by his devoted wife Margaret and his 5 beloved children (Figure). He talked about his children constantly, even in academic presentations in front of thousands of strangers. Jay always said, \u201cHumor is an important tool in the practice of medicine. In teaching, I use it to engage the learner; in practice, it creates a relationship between me and the patient, which levels the playing field and puts them at ease.\u201d To clinical colleagues, he was the go-to clinician for tropical medicine cases; to trainees, he was the master professor to whom those from all over Canada came to work and learn; and to audiences worldwide, he was a marquee attraction for his legendary humor and wit (1). His clever political incorrectness never failed to augment the delivery of the key points on tropical and emerging exotic diseases.",

He was in his first year as director of the Tropical Disease Unit after returning from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and fieldwork in Africa and South America. He was clearly on track to lead the divergence of travel medicine from tropical medicine. Air travel was changing that. His famous teaching slide was a response to the question, \u201cWhat is the most dangerous vector in the world?\u201d The slide answered, \u201cAnopheles Air canadensi\u201d and showed the appropriately branded 747 in midflight. He was among the first to recognize that the rapid movement of infected and potentially infectious persons away from the point of infection acquisition would require Keystone-level clinical insights to differentiate the usual tropical diseases from the novel. He imparted to his large cadre of trainees, mentees, and collaborators the use of people skills to forge the links with the laboratory and public health colleagues necessary to complete these puzzles.",

            "text": "Jay authored approximately 200 publications with more than 5,000 citations, remarkable considering the relative obscurity of some of the diseases investigated. His most cited papers were collaborative across multiple disciplines, and none would have been possible without Jay\u2019s acumen at sorting the clinically relevant from the irrelevant. In 1984, working with Canadian surgeon Bernie Langer, Jay published an often-cited case series on the surgical approach to hepatic hydatid disease in immigrants from Greece and Italy to Canada, which forms the basis for our current approaches and understanding (2). In 1998, working with Kevin Kain, Jay reported the problems encountered when diagnosing and managing imported malaria, which codified issues we still struggle with today (3). A 2004 paper articulated the difficulties of dealing with infection in immigrants and their descendants returning home to visit friends and relatives (4). Jay\u2019s legacy includes a superb cadre of clinicians in Toronto, poised in prescient preparation for the next emergence event. Past sentinel events include outbreaks of travelers\u2019 leptospirosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Zika, and drug-resistant malaria.",

Returning travelers are often sentinels of emerging infectious diseases. GeoSentinel continues to be the largest available database of travel-related illness. With the initial efforts by Phyllis Kozarsky, Hans Lobel, Marty Cetron, and me, and with Jay\u2019s stature behind us, the eventual results were the continuous Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding of the network to this day. Jay co-authored 2 of the landmark GeoSentinel papers (5,6).",
