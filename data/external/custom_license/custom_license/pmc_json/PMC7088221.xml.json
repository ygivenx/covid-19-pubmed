            "text": "Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Fam. Fabaceae) commonly known as licorice or mulethi (Gantait et al. 2010) contains a significant amount of glycyrrhizin (2\u20138% dry weight) in its roots. Glycyrrhizin is an oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin (Seki et al. 2011) having numerous medicinal properties, such as immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, and antiallergic (Seki et al. 2008). It is also effective against HIV (Ito et al. 1987, 1988) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like viruses (Nasrollahi et al. 2014). Glycyrrhizin is used globally as a flavoring agent, natural sweetener, and preservative as well. It is effectively used in the treatment of menstrual cramps, menopause symptoms, dropsy, fever, irritated urinary and respiratory passages, hypoglycemia, and influenza. Glycyrrhizin is also used as a diuretic, demulcent, emollient, antispasmodic, expectorant, mild laxative, and as a cough remedy (Alam et al. 2017). The overall demand of glycyrrhizin, which stood at US$ 1.70 bn in 2016, is anticipated to reach US$ 2.3 bn by 2025 (https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/licorice-extracts-market.html).",

Previously, a slow growth method for conservation of G. glabra germplasm was established and was being maintained in the host institute (Srivastava et al. 2013). As an alternative source, hairy root cultures of licorice were established which provide constant high production of glycyrrhizin while maintaining its stable nature for longer time periods (Tenea et al. 2008). Hairy roots synthesize bioactive compounds that are similar or even higher in quantity as compared to normal root cultures (Agostini et al. 2013). These roots are genetically modified roots and also cost effective due to the requirement of hormone-free medium for their growth and proliferation (Ba\u00edza et al. 1999; Lu et al. 2008; Hussain et al. 2012). Agrobacterium rhizogenes, a soil-borne bacterium, facilitates hairy root induction (Thwe et al. 2016). Many studies have been published on A. rhizogenes-mediated hairy root induction in G. glabra (Kovalenko et al. 2004; Mehrotra et al. 2008; Shirazi et al. 2012; Tenea et al. 2008) but so far enhancement of glycyrrhizin in hairy roots by using elicitors such as drought, cellulase and mannan treatments has not been reported yet.",

Factors like drought, temperature, and microbial infections can cause variations in the content of bioactive compounds (Zhao et al. 2005). Strategic implementation of these factors under controlled conditions can also cause strong changes in secondary metabolite yield (Torkamani et al. 2014). Proper optimization of sucrose along with other culture conditions plays a vital role in determining the biomass and secondary metabolite contents in hairy root cultures of G. glabra (Wongwicha et al. 2011). Many reports are available in which elicitation of hairy root cultures has proven to be very effective for enhancement of the yield of secondary metabolites.",

Elicitors are molecules that mimic pathogen attack like conditions, resulting plant activation of their defense system for fighting those unfavorable conditions (Chandra et al. 2014). The role of elicitors in manipulating yield has also been reported in other plants. For example, the yield of azadirachtin was increased fivefold by the use of biotic elicitors (Claviceps purpurea) on Azadirachta indica hairy root cultures (Satdive et al. 2007). Ajmalicine and solasodine production reportedly increased up to 14.8- and 4.0-fold after NaCl treatment in hairy root cultures of Rauwolfia serpentina and Solanum khasianum, respectively (Srivastava et al. 2016).",

A correlation has also been reported between the expression of individual rol genes and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plant cells (Bulgakov 2008). The antioxidant system is involved in combating ROS and is important in preventing losses caused by free radicals (Tohma and Gul\u00e7in 2010). To neutralize the effect of stresses plants use the antioxidative activities of their enzymes, like superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT) etc. (Hatami and Ghorbanpour 2014). This antioxidative enzyme activity results in other collateral responses of plants, such as enhancement of secondary metabolites (Moharrami et al. 2017). Keeping this in mind, the present study dealt with the effects of biotic and abiotic elicitors on the yield of glycyrrhizin and on the SOD activity in hairy roots of G. glabra.",

These roots were treated as control roots in all the comparative analysis with hairy roots. Leaves from in vitro-grown shoots at three different stages, that is, very young, 2\u20133 weeks-old and more than 4-weeks-old were used for transformation. Prior to 2 days of transformation, these leaves were excised and pre-cultured on \u00bd MS solid medium. A single colony from the A. rhizogenes A4 strain was picked up and cultured on liquid YMB medium at 28 \u00b0C for 16\u201318 h at 220 rpm. Bacterial cells (OD600 = 0.6) were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm. For re-suspending the pellets, MS liquid medium with MES buffer and 100 \u00b5M acetosyringone was used. The medium was incubated at 28 \u00b0C at 100\u2013150 rpm for at least 1 h. Precultured leaf sections were pierced with a needle and immersed in infection medium for 20\u201330 min with gentle hand shaking or on a rotary shaker at 70 rpm. Leaf sections immersed in sterile water were also placed under similar conditions to serve as control. Infected leaves were blotted dry on sterile filter paper and placed on co-cultivation medium containing 100 mM acetosyringone for 2\u20133 days in a dark room at 28 \u00b0C. After co-cultivation, leaves were washed with sterilized water containing cefotaxime (250 mg L\u22121), placed on \u00bd MS or full MS medium supplemented with cefotaxime (250 mg L\u22121) but without growth hormones. After emergence of putative hairy roots, approximately 3\u20134 cm long roots were cut and subcultured on separate medium. The concentration of antibiotic was decreased after every subculture and finally omitted prior to transfer in a liquid medium. Full grown hairy roots were transferred to 250 mL flask and placed on a rotary shaker under continuous agitation at 80 rpm and incubated at 25 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C with a 16 h light/8 h dark period.",

Hairy roots were not induced from very young leaves even after 1 month of transformation. However, more than 4-week-old leaves responded but with lower transformation efficiency (< 20%). The 2-day pre-culture period was beneficial for transformation, a further increase up to 4 days did not show any significant change and explants started to necrose under prolonged preculture periods. Two to three days of co-cultivation was sufficient for the visibility of infection. Half MS medium supplemented with cefotaxime (250 mg L\u22121) was best suited for induction of hairy roots. Although, MS medium was also capable of hairy root induction, further growth of the roots was less compared to \u00bd MS medium. Hairy roots emerged after 2\u20133 weeks of transformation (Fig. 1a). 3-cm-long hairy roots (along with some lateral branches) were cut from the explants and subcultured in the liquid medium. The roots having healthy tips grew well. Each root emerging from a separate wounding site was treated as an independent line. Approximately one month was needed for full growth of hairy roots in MS liquid medium without growth hormones (Fig. 1b). On the basis of morphological characters, such as elongation and branching potential, some better appearing putative hairy root lines were selected. DNA was extracted from these lines to confirm the transgenic nature of roots. PCR analysis with TL region primers was conducted to assess the genetic transformation status of hairy root lines.

A five-fold enhancement has been observed in glycyrrhizin content in hairy roots in comparison to control roots. Expressions of HMGR, SQS, FPPS, bAS and CYP88D6 genes were higher in hairy roots. This high expression of important genes of the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway was supported by a high yield of glycyrrhizin in hairy roots. Production of secondary metabolites and expression of their corresponding biosynthetic genes have a strong correlation (Matsuda et al. 2010). The expression of rol genes (rolA, rolB, and rolC) is responsible for enhanced levels of secondary metabolites in hairy roots (Shkryl et al. 2008). The rol genes enhanced the production of phytoalexins by activating the expression of defense-related genes. The mode of activation of these genes was slightly different from the regular calcium-dependent NADPH oxidase pathway and other plant defense-related hormonal pathways (Bulgakov 2008).",

Enhancement in triterpenoid yield was also reported after drought stress (Selmar and Kleinw\u00e4chter 2013). Drought started the formation of reactive oxidation species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO\u2212), superoxide (O2\u2212\u2212) and singlet oxygen (1O2) to cause a disturbance in normal cell homeostasis (Ozkur et al. 2009). To overcome these situations, plants depend on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. Triterpenoids are associated with antioxidant activities (Okubo and Yoshiki 2000). Glycyrrhizin (triterpenoid) acting as a ROS depreciator, plays a crucial role in contesting the oxidative stress thus minimizes the negative effect of drought stress (Kim and Lee 2008). Isopentenyl pyrophosphate, a precursor of terpene biosynthesis, was enhanced under drought stress (Turtola et al. 2003). Glycyrrhizin production was also enhanced through methyl jasmonate treatment in G. inflata (Wongwicha et al. 2011). MeJa and SA enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin by 3.8 and 4.1-fold, respectively, in the roots of G. glabra (Shabani et al. 2009).",

In previous reports, mannan enhanced pseudohypericin production up to 2.8-fold and hypericin production up to 1.7-fold in seedlings of Hypericum adenotrichum (Yamaner et al. 2013). Cellulase was also effective in enhancing the yield of capsidiol in suspension cultures of Capsicum annuum (Ma 2008). The exact mechanism of action of elicitation by cellulase and mannan is still not clearly known, but it may be presumed that they activate the genes of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways. The possible mode of action of the cellulase mechanism is that it either depolarizes the plant cell or activates the endogenous ion channels. Probably, due to the pore forming ability of cellulase, the ions are filtered with ease by the membrane avoiding any need for channel activation and receptor binding (Klusener and Weiler 1999).",

Infection of A. rhizogenes activates the plant defense system through enhanced production of secondary metabolites and PR protein synthesis (Bulgakov et al. 2013).

The enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems of cells were activated to protect the cells from the detrimental effects of ROS activities (Shkryl et al. 2010). SOD acts like a first line of defense, changing O2\u2212 into H2O2, after which H2O2 immediately converts into O2 and H2O by other antioxidant systems (Chen et al. 2017b). In the present work, SOD activity was also estimated in elicited and non elicited roots.",

The enhancement in SOD activity has been reported under drought stress in many other plant species such as sunflower (Gunes et al. 2008), wheat (Bakalova et al. 2004) and G. uralensis (Pan et al. 2006).",

Elicitation strategies ought to be helpful in large-scale production of glycyrrhizin from hairy root cultures of G. glabra in a bioreactor system. This could be empirically utilized in the commercialized mass production of glycyrrhizin. Concentration and duration of elicitation are plant and elicitor specific, therefore, optimized conditions could be helpful in future molecular studies regarding pathway analysis of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Moreover, glycyrrhizin is a valuable pharmaceutical compound and due to its root centric nature, extraction of this compound severely destroys the whole plant thereby endangering its existence and affecting biodiversity. By applying the above-mentioned approaches, high concentrations of glycyrrhizin could be obtained without loss of biodiversity and in a short time span.",
