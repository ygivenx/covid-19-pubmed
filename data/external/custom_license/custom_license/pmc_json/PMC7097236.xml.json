Many are relieved that standardized guidelines have finally been established, enabling the industry to harmonize practices and provide reassurance to large corporate clients that represent their bread and butter.",

In the absence of clear government guidance, the IASB and its counterpart, the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC), each developed their own 'best practices' for screening both DNA orders and the customers that place them. To draw up its official guideline, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in Washington, DC, received comments from 22 organizations and individuals since publishing its draft Guidance in November 2009 (Table 1). The final version\u2014released in October\u2014includes only a few notable changes, such as the elimination of a size cut-off for screening decisions on double-stranded segments.",
