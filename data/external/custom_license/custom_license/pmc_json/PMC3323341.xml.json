The best fit gives \u03b2 = 0.25 and l = 0.43. We also estimated the relative infectiousness after isolation (l) for the case of Singapore (l = 0.49) by following the least squares procedure described above. However, for the case of Toronto, not enough data were available on the initial growth of the outbreak. Hence, we only estimated l from Toronto data after control measures were put in place on March 26 (10,11), where l = 0.1.

The lower-risk subpopulation lies in the age range <19. It constitutes approximately 23% of Hong Kong's population (3). The fact that most of the SARS cases included in the epidemiologic studies of the Toronto outbreak (5) were transmitted in hospitals limits the use of general demographic data from Toronto in the estimation of \u03c1 and p. Hence, we used the parameters estimated from the situation in Hong Kong. Baseline values for all the parameters are given in Table 1.",

We used a Monte Carlo procedure (simple random sampling) to quantify the uncertainty of R0 to model parameters when these parameters are distributed. Similar methods have been used before (12\u201314). Parameters (k, \u03b32, \u03b4, \u03b1) were assigned a different probability density function (PDF) (Figure 1), which is taken from reference 3. The relative measure of infectiousness of persons after isolation procedures are put in place (l) was assumed to be uniformly distributed in the interval (0 < l < 1). The observed heterogeneity in transmission rates during the SARS epidemic is modeled here by assuming that \u03b2 is distributed exponentially with mean 0.25 person\u20131 day\u20131 (our estimate of the transmission rate in Hong Kong). Parameters q, p, and \u03c1 are fixed to their baseline values (Table 1). We sampled the set of six parameters (\u03b2, k, \u03b32, \u03b4, \u03b1, l) 105 times, holding q, p, and \u03c1 fixed. We then computed R0 from each set. A probability density function for R0 is obtained and can be statistically characterized. Here, we characterize R0 by its median and interquartile range.",

Hence, we rank model parameters according to the size of their effect on R0. Partial rank correlation coefficients (12\u201315) were computed between each of the parameters (with the exception of p, q, and \u03c1, which were held fixed) and R0 as samples were drawn from the distributions, thus quantifying the strength of the parameter's linear association with R0. The larger the partial rank correlation coefficient, the larger the influence of the input parameter on the magnitude of R0. Because the distribution of the parameter l (relative infectiousness after isolation) is not known, we also studied the sensitivity of R0 to various distributions of l. Distributions of l used for the Monte Carlo calculation of the partial rank correlation coefficients are: a) l ~ \u03b2 (a = 2, b = 2) where \u03b2 is used to denote a beta distribution. Here, the likelihood of l is bell-shaped with mean 0.5 and variance 0.05; b) l ~ \u03b2 (a = 1, b = 2), the likelihood of l decreases linearly in the [0,1] interval; and c) l ~ \u03b2 (a = 2, b = 1), the likelihood of l increases linearly in the [0,1] interval.",

The systematic decline in R0 with increasing l in the range [0,1] is illustrated in Figure 4. Furthermore, our results do not change if we assume the three distributions mentioned in the Methods section (sensitivity analysis) for the parameter l. Table 3 shows the partial rank correlation coefficients for the other three possible distributions of l. The transmission rate is ranked first independent of the distribution of l. The relative infectiousness after isolation is ranked second when l comes from distributions (a) and (b) and ranked third when it comes from distribution (c) (see Methods). Our sensitivity analysis is corroborated by computing local derivatives on R0 (see Appendix). Because bounds exist on how much a given parameter can change in practice, achieving control (i.e., R0 < 1) can require changing parameters other than those with the highest partial rank correlation coefficient. For example, reference 10 showed that control of the outbreak in Toronto relied on both a reduction in l and 1/\u03b1, even though \u03b1 is ranked fairly low by the partial rank correlation coefficient.",

Even though the median of R0 is <1 when perfect patient isolation is assumed (l = 0), we find that 25% of our R0 distribution lies at R0 > 1.

This means that a substantial effort must be (and has been) made by the medical community to modify other parameters, such as the diagnostic rate. Hence, the strong sensitivity of R0 to the transmission rate \u03b2 indicates that efforts in finding intervention strategies that manage to systematically lower the contact rate of persons of all age groups promise an effective means for lowering R0. Such strategies may include using face masks (the probability of transmission per contact may be reduced), washing hands, and avoiding large crowds (large public events).",
