In its simplest form: \nR\n0 can be estimated from the final attack rate if the population was fully susceptible at the outset. However, in many situations, populations have pre\u2010existing immunity, and a proportion of exposures leads to subclinical infections, reducing the apparent attack rate. The proportion immune (\u03c9) within a particular population determines the effective reproductive number (R) by the relationship: \nR\n0 provides a worst\u2010case scenario for the attack rate. Furthermore, in combination with the mean generation time (serial interval between cases) and the proportion susceptible, R\n0 determines the rate of spread of an outbreak. In favourable circumstances, R\n0 can be estimated from outbreak data, with parallel inferences about levels of subclinical infection and prior immunity.",
