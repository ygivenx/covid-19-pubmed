They are generated by an in vitro selection process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), which was first reported in 1990 [6, 7]. The SELEX method has permitted the identification of unique RNA/DNA molecules from very large populations of random sequence oligomers (DNA or RNA libraries), and they bind to the target molecule with high affinity and specificity. Aptamers show a very high affinity for their targets, with dissociation constants typically from the micromolar to the low picomolar range, comparable to and sometimes even better than those of some monoclonal antibodies [8].",

            "text": "In comparison to antibodies, aptamer receptors have a number of advantages that make them very promising for analytical and diagnostic applications. The main advantage is overcoming the problem of using animals for their production. Aptamers are isolated by in vitro methods that do not require animals: an in vitro combinatorial library can be generated against any target. Moreover, the aptamer selection process can be manipulated to obtain aptamers that bind a specific region of the target, with specific binding properties in different binding conditions. After selection, aptamers are produced by chemical synthesis and purified to a very high degree by eliminating the batch-by-batch variation found when using antibodies and, by chemical synthesis, modifications in the aptamer can be introduced to enhance the stability, affinity, and specificity of the molecule. Finally, because of their simple structure, sensor layers based on aptamers can be regenerated more easily than antibody-based layers, are more resistant to denaturation and have a much longer shelf life. Moreover, the selection process itself, with the amplification step, gives advantages to aptamers with respect to other \u201cnon-natural\u201d receptors, such as oligopeptides, which cannot be amplified during their selection procedure. Due to all these characteristics, aptamers have been used in numerous investigations, as therapeutic [9] or diagnostic tools [10] and for the development of new drugs.",

Both maturation and migration of DCs are orchestrated carefully by panoplies of chemokines and adhesion molecules. Adhesion molecules are crucial for all cellular interactions of the DC during its journey from bone marrow into blood, from blood into the peripheral tissues and subsequently into lymphoid tissues. Recently, many new cell-surface molecules on DCs have been identified, and these may contribute to DC functions in controlling innate, as well as adaptive immunity. In particular, a large diversity of C-type lectins have been identified on DCs; some of these regulate pathogen recognition, while others regulate signaling or cellular interactions, such as DC migration and T cell binding. Several years ago, Geijtenbeek and his co-workers identified DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a novel adhesion receptor on human DCs that is essential in several key functions throughout the DC lifecycle [12], especially in the interactions between DCs and T cells or vascular endothelial cells (ECs).",

The ssDNA pools were denatured by heating at 90\u00b0C for 5 min in a binding buffer (SHCMK) containing 20 mmol/l Hepes, pH 7.35, 120 mmol/l KCl, 1 mmol/l CaCl2, and 1 mmol/l MgCl2 and then denatured at room temperature for 15 min. In order to reduce background binding, a 5-fold molar excess of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added. The ssDNA library was combined in BSA-blocked blank wells at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, in order to screen out ssDNA, which had bound to BSA. Then unbound ssDNA was incubated with DC-SIGN-coated wells at 37\u00b0C for 40 min. Unbound ssDNA sequences were washed six times with washing buffer (SHCMK + 0.05% Tween 20). After that, eluting buffer (20 mmol/l Tris\u2013HCl, 4 mol/l guanidinium isothiocyanate, 1 mmol/l DTT, pH 8.3) was added and incubated at 80\u00b0C for 10 min, and ssDNA bound to DC-SIGN was eluted and mixed with phenol-chloroform.

Aptamers are antibody analogs in terms of both specificity and affinity, with an apparent advantage over antibodies in that they can be produced by automated chemical synthesis. There are many reports about selection of aptamers against target proteins from a random oligonucleotide library. For example, Beinoraviciute\u2013Kellner selected for specific ABF1 binding sequences on double-stranded DNA by a SELEX procedure in vitro [28].

While it is not practical to create comprehensive libraries, large libraries do increase the probability that high-affinity ligands will be present. We constructed a DNA oligonucleotide library containing a 35-base central random sequence, and selected for ssDNA binding to DC-SIGN protein by using a microwell plate screening technique, PCR and biotin\u2013streptavidin magnesphere separation during the SELEX process. After 11 rounds of selection, we cloned, purified, and sequenced the PCR products, and obtained 21 DNA aptamers against DC-SIGN.
