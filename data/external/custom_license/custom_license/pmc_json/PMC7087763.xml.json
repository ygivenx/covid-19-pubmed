A non-traumatic ON may be associated with an excessive corticosteroid administration, alcohol abuse or hematologic abnormality, and characterized by young onset age (20\u201350 years) and multiple joints involvement. Among several pathogeneses of non-traumatic ON, the intravascular coagulation activated by various potential risk factors may be a common way that results in the intraosseous thrombosis and ON. Moreover, as reported in a number of publications [1\u20136, 7], the ON is associated with an individual\u2019s hyper-coagulable/hypo-fibrinolytic status, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and corresponding gene polymorphism 4G/5G play an important role in the arterial or venous thrombosis [8].",

Our previous study had revealed that hyper-coagulation and hypo-fibrinolysis were found in patients with post-SARS ON [10, 11].

The films were evaluated by qualified radiologists and orthopedists, respectively, and an agreement for the final diagnosis may be obtained by a cooperative discussion for the films resulting in discrepant opinions from the two independent professionals. A total of 61 patients identified with ON (25 men, 36 women) and aged 30.4 years (20\u201360 years) were included as the study population in the present study. The following baseline parameters were obtained for these patients: mean received corticosteroid 7,706.4 mg (1,200\u201330,000 mg), mean daily maximal dosage of corticosteroid 373.2 mg (80\u20131,020 mg), mean duration of the corticosteroid medication 40.8 days (14\u2013105 days) and mean duration of pulse therapy with corticosteroid (>80 mg/day) 30.1 days (9\u201367 days). The joints involve included femoral head (N = 50, 87 hips; unilateral 13, bilateral 37), knee (N = 35, 63 knees; unilateral 7, bilateral 28), shoulder (N = 15, 24 shoulders; unilateral 6, bilateral 9), wrist (N = 4, 7 wrists; unilateral 1, bilateral 3; the individual bone involvement: 7 scaphoid bones, 2 capital bones and 1 lunar bone). The shaft involvement alone was seen in one patient. A total of 52 healthy volunteers without SARS and no steroid therapy [22 men, 30 women; aged 35.1 years (15\u201361 years)] were included in the present study as the control.",

The intravascular coagulation-induced thrombosis in the subchondral microcirculation may result in intraosseous hypertension, reduced blood stream and osteocytic ischemia/hypoxia, consequently leading to the necrosis of bone cells. This theory was further supported by the study conducted by Starklint et al. [15], who found fibrin thrombi in the area with ON. Hyper-coagulable/hypo-fibrinolytic status can be inherent or acquired. As a result of excessive corticosteroid administration, patients with SARS may develop such hyper-coagulable/hypo-fibrinolytic status, attributable to the intraosseous thrombosis and resulted ON. Therapy with corticosteroid may provide for the recipients a prethrombotic stage which is a pathological state that may contribute to the thrombosis. In patients with previously existed hyper-coagulable/hypo-fibrinolytic status, corticosteroid therapy may be more risky in the formation of ON. This is called as second hit theory for ON [16, 17].",

The fibrinolysis is indeed a chain reaction catalyzed by a group of proteins, mainly functioning to immediately lyze the fibrin clot created locally and temporally to prevent from thrombosis. Among these factors, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), a member of serine proteinase inhibitors, mainly takes effect via the deactivation of the tissue plasminogen activator and presents with an increased activity in hyper-coagulable and thrombotic diseases. The correlation between fibrinolytic disorders and ON has been confirmed in many publications. Similar to the study by Glueck et al.

            "text": "Human PAI-1 gene is located at Chromosome 7q21.3~q22, containing 9 exons and 8 introns. Recent studies revealed that a 4G/5G polymorphism may be generated by inserting a guanosine (G) at the 675 bp upstream the transcription initiating site of the promoter region of PAI-1. As seen in clinically observational studies, 4G/5G polymorphism may be closely related to the plasma PAI-1 activity as allele G4 may be associated with an increased plasma PAI-1 level. In Glueck\u2019s series [20], 24 of 59 patients with ON (41 %) were identified as 4G/4G homozygote versus the controls (20 %), so that he considered the PAI polymorphism may be the causative factor of the ON. Paolo et al. [21] performed a determination to the PAI-1 gene in patients with ON developed posterior to the renal transplantation and revealed that the presence of 4G/4G was more frequent to see in this patient group than in the patients absent of ON, thus concluding that genotype 4G/4G can serve as a indictor for the ON posterior to the renal transplantation. Moreover, as reported by Asano et al. [22], a discrepancy between the races may be observed in this aspect since no correlation was found between PAI-1 gene polymorphism and Japanese with post-renal transplantation ON.",

In the present study, the plasma PAI level was higher in patients with genotype 4G/4G than those with the other two genotypes, suggesting the correlation between the increased PAI level in ON and the genotype 4G/4G. This indicated that PAI may be a potential biomarker used for the screening of the predisposing factor of ON and that PAI genotype 4G/4G may be the genetic marker for ON in Chinese patients. In conclusion, PAI and PAI-1 genotype 4G/4G deserve an important value in the screening for the population highly susceptible to non-traumatic ON.",
