Studies on triage protocols arose primarily from critical care professionals awakened to those responsibilities during severe acute respiratory syndrome and then re-challenged during the current H1N1 pandemic [2-4].",

The most plausible scenario for a viral pathogen of greater severity and lethality is that emergency departments and hospital wards will be deluged with critical care patients, the challenge being how to provide 'opportunities for survival' by transferring some semblance of critical care services and expertise to these 'non-critical care' settings. Discipline-directed triage management protocols will only be as important as the manner in which these tertiary level algorithms can be integrated into a larger system-wide triage scheme that begins at the primary triage care level and ends with whatever additional resources a regional support system can mobilize. Many 'uncomfortable but real' decisions that have not, to date, been operationalized at the local level will be made.",

While attempts to provide independent hospital-centric plans are noble, they do not solve what ultimately requires an integrated population-based system-wide solution [6].",
