Early reports in the winter of 2002 were that ducks, geese and swans in Hong Kong were dying. Because the influenza virus is normally asymptomatic in aquatic birds, the scientists were concerned that the virus had altered for the worse. Then, early in 2003, when media reports from Guangdong began sounding the alarm about an unusual illness, the researchers instantly stepped up surveillance in Hong Kong. Everyone was sure the culprit was a flu virus.",
