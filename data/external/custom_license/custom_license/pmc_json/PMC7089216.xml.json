            "text": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the etiological agent of infectious bursal disease (IBD), which is a highly contagious disease in 3- to 15-weeks-old chickens. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and targets the precursors of antibody-producing B cells in the bursa of Fabricius (BF). Infection by this virus leads to a severe immunosuppression characterized by the destruction of B cells present in the BF. The induced immunodepression increases susceptibility to other pathogens [1]. Two distinct serotypes (I and II) are recognized for IBDV. The serotype I virus strains differ markedly in virulence, classic and very virulent IBDV strains cause hemorrhagic inflammation of the BF, whereas variant strains cause rapid bursal atrophy without evoking an inflammation response [1, 2]. In contrast to the serotype I, the serotype II viruses are naturally avirulent for chickens [3]. IBD is one of the most important diseases affecting the poultry industry worldwide.",

Segment A has two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The smaller ORF encodes VP5, a nonstructural protein of 17 kDa, which is not required for viral replication [4]. The larger ORF encodes a 110-kDa polyprotein precursor in the order NH2-pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH. The polyprotein appears to be cotranslationally processed through the proteolytic activity of the viral protease, VP4, to generate pVP2, VP4, and VP3 [5\u20137]. pVP2, the VP2 precursor, is further processed at its C terminus to become VP2 through the cleavage of three alanine\u2013alanine bonds and an alanine\u2013phenylalanine bond [8]. VP2 and VP3 are structural proteins forming the virus capsid [6]. Segment B encodes VP1 which is known as a multifunctional protein with polymerase and capping enzyme activities [9, 10].",

            "text": "To successfully infect a host, viruses have to both exploit the cellular resources and at the same time avoid defense reactions of the host organism. One of the common obstacles facing a virus is the overwhelming stoichiometric imbalance of the target proteins over those encoded by the virus. To overcome this, many viruses have evolved the ability to utilize the host protease machinery to direct cellular protein degradation for their survival and replication [11]. 26S proteasome is a large multi-subunit complex that selectively degrades intracellular proteins. It is involved in a wide variety of proteolytically mediated intracellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, metabolic regulation, and transcriptional control [12]. The majority of proteins that target the proteasome are tagged with polyubiquitin, which serves as a signal for their degradation. In the process of protein degradation, substrates are first tagged by ubiquitin by three enzymes, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1 enzyme), ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme (E2 enzyme), and ubiquitin ligase (E3 ligase) [13]. The polyubiquitinated proteins are then rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Recent studies have implicated that the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway might play key roles in virus infection and facilitates activities required for various aspects of the virus life cycle, from entry [14] through replication [15, 16] and enhanced cell survival [11] to viral release [17, 18]. In addition, proteasome inhibitors reduce the replication or progeny release of several viruses, including coxsackievirus B3 [19], human cytomegalovirus [20], human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [21], and Sendai virus [22].",

But, whether inhibition of IBDV-induced apoptosis by treatment with proteasome inhibitors is associated with reduction of viral replication is still unclear. However, these results raise the possibility that the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway may be used during IBDV infection to promote viral replication and infectivity. Thus, in the present study, we attempted to explore the role of proteasome inhibition in IBDV infectivity and the mechanisms contribute to proteasome inhibitor suppression of IBDV replication in cultured cells and then the relationship between IBDV-induced apoptosis and viral replication.",

            "text": "Viral infections frequently result in the degradation of proteasome in the infected cells. To assess whether the proteasome\u2013ubiquitin system plays a role in IBDV infection, two chemically distinct proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, were used to address the question. The peptide-aldehyde MG132 is a highly potent and reversible inhibitor of the chymotryptic-like activity of the proteasome [32]. In contrast, lactacystin is highly specific and inhibits the proteasome irreversibly by its action on the catalytic threonine of the 26S proteasome \u03b2-subunits [32]. In a preliminary experiment, DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV strain LM at a MOI of 20 TCID50 and then incubated with 50 \u03bcM of MG132 for 2, 4, or 6 h treatment as described elsewhere [28], the results indicated that viral titer from supernatant of infected cells at 21 h after infection was significantly decreased when incubated with MG132 for 6 h, as compared to that of incubation with the proteasome inhibitor for 2 or 4 h (data not shown). Therefore, in subsequent experiments, we treated infected cells with proteasome inhibitors for 6 h. To determine whether IBDV production was dose-dependently reduced by proteasome inhibitor treatment, DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV strain LM and then treated with various concentrations of proteasome-specific inhibitors. At 6 h after infection, the input proteasome inhibitors were removed and replaced by growth medium without these inhibitors. Supernatants were collected 21 h p.i., and the amount of progeny virus was determined by titration using TCID50 assays on DF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). IBDV replication in untreated cells resulted in the generation of a viral titer of 106.5 TCID50/0.1 ml after 21 h p.i., whereas proteasome inhibition reduced the titer of released virus in the supernatant in a dose-dependent manner. MG132 and lactacystin had very similar inhibitory effects on virus production. These data indicated that proteasome inhibitors significantly blocked IBDV production, suggesting that the proteasome may play an important role in IBDV production.\n\n",

            "text": "Recently, several viruses were found to require active proteasomes. Retroviruses require the proteasome for budding from cells [33\u201335], the human cytomegalovirus for inducing cell cycle progression [36, 37], the simian virus 5 and human parainfluenza virus type 2 for blocking IFN signaling [38, 39], Epstein\u2013Barr virus and herpes simplex virus 1 for regulating viral latency [40, 41], minute virus of mice for nuclear translocation [42], and murine coronavirus for its transfer from endosome to cytoplasm during viral entry [43]. Adenovirus requires active proteasomes to promote late gene expression [44] and coxsackievirus for viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis [19]. In the present study, we showed that the proteasome inhibitor decreased IBDV replication via suppression of viral RNA transcription (Fig. 4A) and protein translation (Fig. 4B, C), and further showed that the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system is involved in an early step of IBDV replication but does not block virus internalization (Fig. 3A, B). However, whether the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway-mediated IBDV replication is related to ubiquitination process and/or the proteasome degradation is not clear. We examined the proteasome activity following IBDV infection and to determine the effect of proteasome inhibitor on its activity. 26S proteasome activities were unchanged in IBDV-infected DF-1 cells, whereas proteasome inhibitor MG132 dramatically inhibited proteasome activity in both mock- and IBDV-infected cells (data not shown). In addition, we also observed a significant accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins after MG132 treatment by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Therefore, the ubiquitination process may play a role in the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway-mediated IBDV replication or protein degradation.",

However, the IBDV RNA transcription and protein synthesis in the infected cells in the presence of MG132 was not available in the study [28]. In this study, IBDV RNA transcription and protein synthesis were significantly inhibited in the IBDV-infected cells after treatment with MG132 at 50 \u03bcM (Fig. 4A\u2013C), and activations of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were dose-dependently reduced after treatment with various concentrations of MG132 (Fig. 5). Therefore, we suggested that proteasome inhibitors decrease IBDV infectivity and the anti-apoptotic effect of the proteasome inhibitor may be due to reduced viral replication.",

Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a well-known event in apoptosis that is often required formation of downstream caspases. In this study, we for the first time demonstrated that the cytochrome c was also located in the cytoplasm of IBDV-infected cells as assayed by Western-blotting (Fig. 6). Furthermore, levels of cytochrome c in cytosol fractions were dose-dependently reduced after treatment with various concentrations of MG132 (Fig. 6). Released cytochrome c activates caspase-9 in concert with the cytoplasmic factors dATP and Apaf-1, as a result, leading consequently to activation of caspase-3 [46]. Therefore, IBDV-induced apoptosis in cultured cells suggests that IBDV is capable of influencing mitochondrial functions, leading to the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, which is related to the level of viral replication, triggering the latent activity of caspases and activation of apoptosis.",
