The Assurance Statement reflects the institution's commitment to complying with the Animal Welfare Act1, the US Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research and Training2 and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide)3,4. Institutions are also required by the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals5 to plan, write and implement an animal care and use program based on the Guide. In 2011, the eighth edition of the Guide3 was published, updating the 1996 edition4. In 2012, the US National Institutes of Health adopted the eighth edition of the Guide, and OLAW began requiring assured institutions to use this edition as the basis for their animal care and use programs by 31 December 2012.",

In addition, there must be sufficient space to comfortably rest away from areas soiled by urine and feces.\u201d The last sentence includes a slight change in the language from the seventh edition4: \u201c[an animal]...must have enough clean bedded or unobstructed area to move and rest in.\u201d The change removes the subjective determination of what constitutes a \u201cclean bedded\u201d area, defining it specifically as an area free of feces and urine.",

OLAW gave the following response (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/111208_seminar_transcript.pdf): \u201cIn OLAW's experience, the accumulation of urine and feces, even with species such as shrews and rodents, is most often concentrated in certain areas of the cage and the animals choose to make their bedding/nesting area removed from their toileting area. It is when a cage or pen becomes overcrowded with animals or is infrequently changed that the ability to rest away from soiled areas becomes a problem.\u201d",

I hypothesized that standard cage-changing frequencies for rodents in laboratory animal facilities would not be adequate to provide unsoiled resting areas for mice and rats and thus would not meet the standard of care recommended in the Guide.

The light cycle for both species was 12-h:12-h light:dark with the lights coming on at 7:00 a.m., and animals were given ad libitum access to Teklad 8640 Rodent diet (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI) and ad libitum access to tap water (through an automatic watering system for mice and via water bottles for rats). Cages for rats and mice were manually filled with bedding (not autoclaved; either 0.6-cm corn cob (The Andersons Inc., Maumee, OH) or aspen chip (Sani Chip, Harlan Laboratories)) by technicians to a bedding depth of 0.6\u20131.3 cm.

When filling cages with bedding, technicians were blinded as to which animals would be participating in the study to avoid bias.

Adequate resting space was defined as an area in which each of the rodents in the cage could lie down either curled up or stretched out without contacting fecal material: approximately 25 cm2 for a mouse and 150 cm2 for a rat. During evaluations, cages were disturbed as little as possible to prevent redistribution of bedding and feces as a result of animal movements. Cages were evaluated visually from above and below because feces frequently dropped through the bedding material and settled on the cage floor. During the evaluation procedure, the observer removed the cage from the rack and removed the lids of individually ventilated cages. He then examined the cage from above and noted whether adequate feces-free resting space was available using the estimated areas given above. He then examined the cage from below and similarly noted the availability of unsoiled resting space from this perspective. For cages housing mice, the observer also examined the nesting material and bedding below it and noted whether feces were present in the nest. Finally, he replaced the lids on individually ventilated cages and returned each cage to the rack. If the observer found that all the cages in a particular group lacked available unsoiled resting space for two consecutive days, observations for that group were discontinued.",

Although no cages met institutional criteria requiring early changing due to lack of cleanliness during the study, cages housing two or three rats were considered heavily soiled by animal care staff members on the scheduled cage-change day (after 3 or 4 days; Fig. 7). The rats often were very active in the cage when approached, and it is likely that typical daily activity resulted in movement of bedding and feces throughout the cage. In a few cages (< 10%), the rats cleared both bedding and feces away from certain areas and they could rest directly on the cage floor.",

Rodents, even singly housed mice, did not appear to use a specific area in their cages for defecation. They did appear to use certain areas in cages more frequently for urination, although they may also have urinated in other areas. The results of this study also do not support the notion that rodents make their nest away from toileting areas. In this study, in cages with available resting areas, feces were present in the nesting area of mice in 59% of cage observations, refuting the hypothesis that mice would not defecate in their nests. Instead, the mice defecated in their nesting areas, defecated randomly in their cages or built their nests where they defecated. These observations call into question the idea that mice and rats have an aversion to feces as humans and some other animals do. Because they are coprophagic animals, one might not expect fecal aversion to be a normal characteristic of rodents. It is not known whether or how the availability of feces-free resting areas affects rodent welfare.",

First, I examined cages with only adult animals including one mouse strain and one rat stock and limited cage variables and bedding types, bedding depth and the presence of nesting material. Results of studies using animals of different stocks, strains, ages or weights; different housing densities; different bedding materials or depths; or different environmental enrichment items could vary. Despite this limitation, I believe the results are applicable to other strains and stocks of mice and rats because of their general similarities in defecation behavior. Second, in order to evaluate the individually ventilated mouse cages, the observer removed the cage lid, which could have disturbed the mice and led to distribution of feces in the bedding. I did not consider this to be a confounding variable because the mice were typically sleeping when the cage lid was removed and moved only after the lid had been lifted, leading to minimal disruption of the feces. Rats could and did move both bedding and feces within their cages, even without human disturbance. Third, when evaluating the presence of feces in rodent cages, the observer included feces that were buried in the bedding, reasoning that an animal lying down on bedding containing feces would have contact with the feces, which would be considered unacceptable. Others might reason that feces in bedding are not in contact with animals and should not be considered to occupy the resting space. Finally, this study did not directly examine behavior or physiology of the rodents.",

Furthermore, the increased cage-change frequency that would be needed to meet the recommendation could have negative effects on rodent welfare by leading to increased stress16,17,18. Therefore, the recommendation of the Guide to provide resting space free of urine or feces for rodents may not be a reasonable expectation and furthermore may not serve to improve animal welfare. This recommendation needs to be further investigated. Studies on rodents' preference for cages with or without feces and on the behavioral and physiological changes that may be associated with the availability of unsoiled resting space should be carried out. Established husbandry standards should be used to determine appropriate cage-change frequencies for rodents in laboratory animal facilities.
