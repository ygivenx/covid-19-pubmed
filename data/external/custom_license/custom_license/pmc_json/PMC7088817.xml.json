Infectious diseases are newly emergent or a recurrence of known infectious diseases, while some persistent infectious diseases are resistant to current techniques available for their control. Each year, approximately 15 million people die from infectious diseases around the world and infectious diseases are the leading cause of death among the population under the age of 50 (Morens et al. 2004; Fauci 2006a). Deliberate release of pathogenic microorganisms as biological weapons or biological terrorism agents is posing a serious threat to national security (Frischknecht 2003). The battle for control of pathogenic microorganisms is a lengthy process, requiring both detailed knowledge of the pathogens and strategies to control infection. However, pathogenic microorganisms have evolved numerous mechanisms for evasion of human defense systems.",

Furthermore, this study focused on comparison of literature related to pathogenic microorganisms among different years and countries, rather than different pathogenic microorganisms. Although the search criteria may not identify all the relevant literature, all publications from different countries and years have the same chance of identification and therefore, the results will not be significantly affected and missed results represent a small proportion of the data. Furthermore, this study focused on literature related to pathogenic microorganisms and not the diseases caused. Therefore, the English name of pathogenic microorganisms was selected as the search target rather than the name of the associated diseases.

SARS coronavirus is a newly emerging pathogen which caused the global SARS outbreak in 2003. Relevant publications reached a peak in 2006 and decreased subsequently. Literature related to HBV has remained stable and represents a relatively low percentage of the worldwide publications, as the incidence of this is not high in the US. Literature on M. tuberculosis increased over the period investigated. Publications related to influenza virus were not obvious before 2005. However, the overall number of influenza virus-related literature increased rapidly due to the H5N1 influenza virus and H1N1 influenza virus global epidemic.

            "text": "Pathogenic microorganisms are a common global threat to both developed and developing countries and collaboration is vital to overcome these challenges. The study of pathogenic microorganisms requires three balances. Firstly, a balance is required between investment in research on BDAPs and CEHTPs. The United States has vigorously strengthened biodefense research and it has been suggested research into other pathogens may have suffered as a consequence (Atlas 2003; Enserink and Kaiser 2005). Secondly, basic and applied research into pathogenic microorganism should maintain a balance. Basic research provides a better understanding of the characteristics of pathogenic microorganisms and pathogenic mechanisms, with the ultimate goal being the provision of the information that forms the basis of applied research into approaches aimed at combating pathogenic microorganisms. The balance between these two aspects of research is critical. For example, in China, the \u201c973\u201d project and National Natural Science Foundation focused on basic research, while the \u201c863\u201d project and the National Science and Technology major projects focused on applied research. Finally, more rapid progress in the study of pathogenic microorganisms should be balanced with meeting biosafety and biosecurity requirements. To date, global research into pathogenic microorganisms, especially biodefense, is extending and the number of laboratories and investigators engaged in studies of hazardous pathogens has increased rapidly. Although the requirement for research into pathogenic microorganisms with regard to biosafety and biosecurity are increasing (Kaiser 2007), it is important that basic investigations should not be compromised.",
