He developed profuse diarrhoea with passage of greenish, watery, loose stools 1 day before admission. He also complained of dry cough, myalgia and general malaise. There was no running nose, chills, rigor, headache or shortness of breath. He resided in a housing estate (Amoy Garden) where a massive outbreak of SARS had occurred.[2] There was no travel history or history of contact with SARS patients. General examination showed a febrile lethargic child with mild dehydration (ca. 5%). Examination of the abdomen showed mild epigastric tenderness but no organomegaly and bowel sounds were normal. There was no respiratory distress. Examination of the other systems was unremarkable. A chest X-ray film revealed right upper zone infiltrates (Fig. 1a). He was administered intravenous cefotaxime and oral clarithromycin to cover the usual organisms associated with community acquired pneumonia. Isolation in a negative pressure room was instituted in view of the epidemiological link to a SARS outbreak.",

A pulse-temperature deficit resembling that of typhoid fever was noted on the observation chart (Fig. 2). On day 6 from onset of fever, intravenous ceftriaxone, the empiric treatment of choice for typhoid fever in our locality, was administered in place of cefotaxime. Ribavirin was commenced for suspected SARS in view of the lack of clinical response to the initial antibiotic regimen. His general condition did not improve and he continued to run a high swinging fever with malaise, epigastric pain, and persistent vomiting and diarrhoea. On day 8, intravenous hydrocortisone was instituted because of radiographic progression of the right upper lobe consolidation (Fig. 1b).",

A novel coronavirus was shown to be the cause of the SARS epidemic [4, 5,9]. Several case series were published documenting the clinical features and the severity of the disease [1, 3, 5, 10,11]. The clinical case definition for SARS were fever, lower respiratory symptoms of cough, difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath, and radiological evidence of pneumonia as defined by the WHO and the CDC [12,13]. Our case report describes an adolescent with confirmed SARS whose main presenting symptoms were gastrointestinal instead of respiratory in origin. In particular, the feature of watery diarrhoea was most prominent. The implication of this atypical presentation is that the patient may escape clinical diagnosis with consequent influence on both treatment and infection control considerations.",

Although the diarrhoea was generally self-limiting, patients with diarrhoea were more likely to require ventilatory support and intensive care [5,7].
