            "text": "Difficulties associated with isolating, culturing and manipulating potential pathogens as well as in quantitatively and temporally connecting the prevalence of a given microbe or virus to specific signs of infection have limited our understanding of the etiology of many wildlife diseases. Given these challenges, non-culture-based methods are increasingly used in research to characterize disease in novel environments or organisms. For example, surveys such as amplicon-based 16S ribosomal DNA profiling, can compare whole microbial assemblages from organisms of different health states, but to comprehensively survey viruses, shotgun-based metagenomic sequencing approaches are often required (Mokili et al., 2012). This is because viruses lack a common phylogenetic marker, and therefore marker-based amplicon sequencing (for example, 16S or 18S ribosomal RNA surveys) cannot necessarily be applied to diverse viral consortia. Some examples of the successful application of viral metagenomics to elucidate the pathogens associated with a disease include the identification of: an astrovirus as the probable cause for shaking mink syndrome (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2010), an anellovirus associated with a California sea lion mortality event (Ng et al., 2009) and a coronavirus that causes human respiratory disease (Bermingham et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Marine wildlife diseases are increasing in prevalence and incidence (Ward and Lafferty, 2004; Harvell et al., 2004). Reports of non-bleaching coral diseases have increased over 50-fold from 1965 to 2005 (Sokolow, 2009). Such epizootics are of concern because they have contributed to declines in coral abundance and cover (Gardener et al., 2003; Rogers, 2009). However, of the >20 described global coral diseases, only 6\u20138 have pathogens ascribed to their etiology (Green and Bruckner, 2000; Sutherland et al., 2004; Rosenberg et al., 2007; Bourne et al., 2009; Pollack et al., 2011). One coral disease of particular ecological importance is white plague (WP), a rapid tissue loss disease that affects multiple species of Caribbean corals, including dominant reef-building Montastraea species. Caribbean WP is characterized by lesions that begin basally or peripherally on a colony, and then progress rapidly (mm to cm per day) across the colony surface resulting in partial to total colony mortality (Richardson et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2006; Weil et al., 2006). Three types of WP (I, II and III) are differentiated based on tissue loss progression rates, with type I progressing the slowest (a few mm per day), type II progressing at a maximum rate of 2 cm per day and type III progressing the fastest (>2 cm per day; Dustan, 1977; Richardson et al., 1998). Although an infectious agent, the bacterium Aurantimonas coralicida, was hypothesized to be the cause of WP type II in the coral Dichocoenia stokesii (Richardson et al., 1998; Denner et al., 2003), A. coralicida is not always associated with WP-infected coral colonies. For example, this bacterium was associated with healthy but not WP-infected Montastraea annularis colonies (Pantos et al., 2003) or WP-infected colonies from different geographic regions and/or host species (Siderastrea, Diploria; Sunagawa et al., 2009; C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Given the limited success in identifying the causative agents of WP diseases, controversy exists as to whether similar disease signs represent unique etiologies. It is possible that the different WP types are either the same disease variably manifested or alternatively, WP signs may represent a variety of different diseases, even in cases where progression rates are similar (Pollock et al., 2011). For example, a WP-like disease of corals in the Red Sea has been shown to be caused by the bacterial pathogen, Thalassomonas loyana, and not A. coralicida. Phage therapy reduces signs of this disease in situ and in aquaria, confirming the bacterial nature of the pathogen (Thompson et al., 2006; Efrony et al., 2009; Atad et al., 2012). Alternatively, an additional hypothesis is that a virus and not a bacterium might be the cause of some of these WP signs. To test this hypothesis, we determined if various viral types are differentially associated with a WP type I-like outbreak that occurred in the US Virgin Islands in 2010.",

            "text": "Currently little is known about viral disease in corals. Studies have characterized the viruses associated with bleached and healthy corals, corals exposed to different environmental stressors, and within the algal symbionts (Symbiodinium spp.) of corals (Wilson et al., 2004; Wegley et al., 2007; Marhaver et al., 2008; Vega Thurber et al., 2008; Correa et al., 2013). Based on these works, four major groups of viruses are predicted to infect corals and their associated microbes: bacteriophages, enveloped herpes-like viruses, nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs, including members of the Phycodnaviridae, Mimiviridae and Iridoviridae), and small circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses (for a review, see Vega Thurber and Correa, 2011). For example, herpes-like sequences were found in stressed Porites compressa corals as well as in other cnidarians such as the starlet anemone, Nematostella, and the medusozoan, Hydra (Vega Thurber et al., 2008). Genomic and microscopic evidence indicate that phycodnavirus-like particles can be present within bleached and/or heat-stressed corals, and these virus-like particles (VLPs) have been suggested to target Symbiodinium (Patten et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2009; Correa et al., 2013). Active infection of Symbiodinium by members of the Phycodnaviridae was indirectly demonstrated based on the identification of phycodnavirus-like complementary DNAs in cultures of two different clades of Symbiodinium (Correa et al., 2013). Finally, sequence similarities to and viral-like particles reminiscent of nano-, circo- and geminiviruses, all of which are eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses and their associated satellites (collectively referred to \u2018SCSDVs' in this paper) also have been found in corals (Davy and Patten, 2007; Wegley et al., 2007; Marhaver et al., 2008; Patten et al., 2008; Vega Thurber et al., 2008; Littman et al., 2011; Rosario et al., 2012).",

Henceforth, we refer to coral colonies exhibiting signs of WP as \u2018diseased' while colonies showing signs of symbiont loss, which may or may not be due to a pathogen, are described as \u2018bleached.' To determine if viruses contribute to either bleaching and/or WP signs, we applied transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and replicated metagenomics to characterize viruses from Caribbean M. annularis corals that appeared healthy, bleached and/or affected by a WP-like disease. Here, we present evidence that (1) the viral consortia among Healthy (H), Bleached (B), WP Diseased (D) and WP Diseased-Bleached (BD) coral tissues are significantly different, and (2) SCSDVs dominate WP Diseased corals but are absent from healthy corals. These data suggest SCSDVs may have a role in some manifestations of WP-like disease in corals.",

However, quantitative TEM analysis could not be performed because of the extensive variation in the quality of the tissues among different health states. For example, tissues were degraded in the WP Diseased samples and cell layers were difficult to discern, whereas Bleached tissues appeared more intact than either WP Diseased or Bleached+WP Diseased tissues. Healthy tissues exhibited intact Symbiodinium-host cell attachment and defined tissue layers, whereas signs of degradation were evident in Bleached tissue types (that is, Symbiodinium detachment; data not shown). Herpesvirus-like particles with a characteristic envelope that were \u223c180 nm in diameter were observed in Bleached+WP Diseased and WP Diseased tissues (Figure 4a). In addition, distinctive figure 8-shaped poxvirus-like particles were visualized in WP Diseased tissues (Figure 4b). Finally, SCSDV-like particles were observed in WP Diseased tissues (Figure 4c; twinned gemini-like particle), however, TEM resolution was low, \u223c20 nm (the size of a typical SCSDV particle), so the features of these VLPs are not well defined. No bacterial cells were observed within the degraded WP Diseased tissue, while in Healthy tissues small cell-like structures (<0.22 um) were commonly identified (data not shown).",

Serratia marcescens, a human bacterial pathogen, also found in sewage was demonstrated to be the cause of white pox disease in acroporids; it is likely that other pathogens including viruses originate from sewage and negatively affect corals (Patterson et al., 2002; Sutherland et al., 2011). However, our analysis of the Rep proteins and genomes of coral and seawater SCSDVs sequenced in this study suggested that the coral SCSDVs are genetically distinct from those found in the surrounding seawater samples and are likely a unique component of the coral virome.

Rather, the higher diversity of viral types found in WP Diseased corals may be a consequence of secondary infections resulting from a coral weakened from other viral infections. On the other hand, a higher viral diversity in WP Diseased corals may be the direct cause of disease signs.

Although it is unclear whether MDA bias is stochastic (Abulencia et al., 2006) or linear (Yilmaz et al., 2010), we calculated that the probability that all WP Diseased (n=7) but no Healthy (n=2) samples contained SCSDV-like sequences was <0.0079 (assuming MDA bias toward ssDNA is 50% or less). Even with a 95% bias of MDA toward SCSDVs, we calculated that there is still <0.7% chance of obtaining these results. Further, much of the debate about the utility of MDA for viral metagenomics comes from studies where samples were processed in different ways. For example, some studies compared the results of MDA amplified versus unamplified libraries, or to data sets generated using amplification methods that do not amplify ssDNA viruses (such as LASLs), or even after the elimination of a denaturing step that would enrich for ssDNA viruses (Kim et al.; 2008; Kim and Bae, 2011). As all of our samples were processed in an identical, scientifically rigorous manner, any bias toward ssDNA sequences should be expressed uniformly in each of the sample libraries. As only the WP Diseased and seawater viromes, but not the bleached and healthy viromes, contained high amounts of these viral types, it is evident that the changes detected in the relative abundance of similarities to these viral types are not the result of MDA. Finally, a previous comparative study on stressed Pacific coral species (not infected with WP) also used MDA but detected SCSDV sequences only in 2 viromes out of 6 (Vega Thurber et al., 2008), while another study on another Pacific coral species using MDA amplification identified <5% nano/circo viruses with no similarities to satellite DNAs or geminiviruses (Wegley et al., 2007).",

Until a proper infection model is developed, correlation with disease prevalence and incidence will be the best evidence as to causes of coral diseases. In addition, this study only examined DNA viruses; it is possible that RNA viruses are involved in WP and future experiments should aim to evaluate viruses with RNA genomes.",

Our microscopy data found no evidence of foreign microbial cells present in WP Diseased corals, strongly suggesting that bacterial or small eukaryotic pathogen infection are not the causes of the examined disease. We also found heterogeneity in the viral consortia among tissue types isolated from the same coral colonies. Bleached+WP Diseased tissues were more similar to Bleached tissues than the WP-Diseased area of the same colony. We thus hypothesize that WP infection is only localized to the disease front, and that bleached and WP Diseased tissues are distinct in their viral composition. Bacteria associated with coral mucus have been shown to be spatially heterogeneous (Daniels et al., 2011), and here we demonstrate viral heterogeneity in a coral colony. Ultimately, we have shown that healthy corals have more abundant viral similarities to Herpesviridae, bleached corals possess more viral similarities to NCLDVs, such as Phycodnaviridae and Poxviridae, and diseased tissues contain an abundance of unique SCSDVs including members similar to Circoviridae and Nanoviridae, as well as their associated satellites; this novel SCSD viral group therefore may be responsible for WP infections in M. annularis.",
