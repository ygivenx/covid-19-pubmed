The \u03b2-lactamase-based enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) assay was pioneered in 200216, 17. The properties of \u03b2-lactamase provide significant advantages in mammalian cells. \u03b2-lactamase is monomeric and relatively small18, and it can be expressed in many different cell types and diverse cellular compartments19. In addition, there is no endogenous \u03b2-lactamase activity. A highly sensitive cell-permeable fluorescent substrate, CCF4/AM, also offers great potential for the quantification of results in intact cells20. In our research, we successfully applied this system to monitor GPCRs activation. Two inactive \u03b2-lactamase deletion fragments, bla(a) and bla(b), were fused to \u03b2-arrestin and GPCR, respectively. The two \u03b2-lactamase fragments complement each other and recover activity by agonist-promoted interaction between GPCR and \u03b2-arrestin. The recovery of \u03b2-lactamase activity was then determined with the cell-permeable fluorescent substrate, CCF4/AM, to demonstrate GPCR activation.",

The \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists are the most widely used agents in the treatment of asthma owing to their bronchodilator actions21. Chinese medicinal herbs have been used to treat many diseases, and they have demonstrated effectiveness for thousands of years. Our lab established a natural compound library containing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fractionated samples from the ethanol extracts of Chinese medicinal herbs. This library was successfully used to find inhibitors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and agonists for dopamine receptors22, 23. In the following, we describe in detail the application of \u03b2-lactamase-based EFC assay to monitor GPCR activation and to screen for agonists of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor from the natural compound library we constructed.",

They were selected as described in materials and methods. The cell clone with the best signal to background ratio was chosen and named HEK/293-\u03b22a2. In this clone, \u03b22AR/bla(b) and \u03b2-arrestin2/bla(a), two fusion constructs, were highly expressed. The two \u03b2-lactamase deletion mutants, bla(a) and bla(b), are individually inactive and have a low affinity for each other. Ligand stimulation caused the conformation change of \u03b22AR and recruited \u03b2-arrestins to the cell membrane. The interaction between \u03b22AR and \u03b2-arrestin brought the two inactive \u03b2-lactamase fragments together to reconstitute a functional enzyme. The recovery of \u03b2-lactamase activity, as determined with the CCF4/AM assay, was a direct indicator of agonist-induced GPCR activation via the \u03b2-arrestin recruitment (Figure 1B).",

The reconstituted \u03b2-lactamase hydrolyzed the substrate CCF4/AM and emitted blue fluorescence when excited at 409 nm. The generation of blue fluorescent cells could be attributed to the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (Figure 2A, top). The agonist effect could be inhibited by the \u03b22AR antagonist, propranolol. When pre-incubated with propranolol, the percentage of cells that emitted blue fluorescence after agonist stimulation was similar to untreated cells (Figure 2A, middle and bottom). Dose response curves for isoproterenol and propranolol were also calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 software. As shown in Figure 2B, HEK/293-\u03b22a2 cells responded to the known \u03b22AR agonist, isoproterenol, with a dose-dependent increase in \u03b2-lactamase activity. The EC50 value of isoproterenol was found to be 15.5 nmol/L, which is not only similar to previously reported data for HEK-293 cells (11 nmol/L) using an isoproterenol-stimulated \u03b22AR sequestration assay25 but also data obtained in C2C12 cells (27 nmol/L) using a \u03b2-galactosidase based EFC assay7. Dose-dependent inhibition was demonstrated under the treatment of the \u03b22AR antagonist, propranolol, in the presence of 1 \u03bcmol/L isoproterenol (Figure 2C). The IC50 of 51.9 nmol/L obtained for propanolol using \u03b2-lactamase EFC assay was also consistent with reported data26.",

Half of the plate was treated with 1 \u03bcmol/L isoproterenol, and half of the plate was untreated. Four wells (A1, B1, G12, and H12) were designed for reagent control to calculate the blue/green ratio for the demonstration of \u03b2-lactamase activity. The Z' factor was 0.68 in our experiment (Figure 3A). To further assess the value of this cell model for searching agonists targeting \u03b22-adrenoceptor, we screened 352 HPLC-fractionated samples from the ethanol extracts of Chinese medicinal herbs in a 96-well format. Isoproterenol was used as the positive control, and 1% DMSO was used as the negative control. Cells were incubated with fractionated samples for 5 min in a serum-free medium. All wells were treated identically, and all contained 1% DMSO, a concentration which has been determined to have no adverse effect on the cells or the assay (data not shown). The fraction activity was expressed as the percentage of maximal \u03b2-lactamase induction by 1 \u03bcmol/L isoproterenol. As shown in Figure 3B, three fractions each exhibited a significant effect on the induction of \u03b2-lactamase activity (>40%). The effect of the other fractions on the induction of \u03b2-lactamase complementation is also shown in Figure 3. These fractions, which had activities below three times of standard deviation, were considered insignificant.",

Fractions 10-B11 and 10-C11 were identified to have >50% of maximum induction while fraction 10-D11 showed >40% of maximum induction. Three positive hits were further validated with the melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) cell line, which was also generated based on the \u03b2-lactamase complementation assay. As expected, they all had no agonist effect on the MC4R cell line (Figure S1). \u03b22-adrenoceptor is a classic G-protein-coupled receptor used for investigation. Once the ligand binds to a \u03b22-adrenoceptor, the receptor will change the conformation and couple to a heterotrimeric G-protein, resulting in an elevation of cAMP levels. Thus, hits obtained from the primary screening were also validated with another functional assay to measure the induction of cAMP expression. As shown in Figure 4B, three fractions had nearly the same intensity of cAMP induction as the positive control, isoproterenol. These two experiments confirm the effect of the three fractions on \u03b22-adrenoceptor activation. Three positive fractions were consecutively obtained from Fructus Aurantii Immaturus. HPLC chromatograms of fractions 10-B11, 10-C11, and 10-D11 are shown in Figure 5. In addition, the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) test showed that fraction treatment at testing condition did not decrease cell viability (data not shown). All these results suggest that a cell-based functional assay system based on \u03b2-lactamase complementation technology has high selectivity for agonist identification. It is a useful tool for high-throughput screening and monitoring GPCR activation.",

Detection of \u03b2-lactamase activity recovery with CCF4/AM could be observed and imaged in intact cells by a fluorescence microscope. This system is also adapted for sorting or analyzing by flow cytometry. The two fragments of \u03b2-lactamase are only about 10 kDa and 19 kDa. They are relatively smaller than many other tag proteins, and their size decreases the possibility of altering the function of chimeric fusion proteins.

            "text": "GPCR activation leads to signal transduction through two mediators: G-proteins and \u03b2-arrestins. Agonists bind to GPCR and activate heterotrimeric G-proteins. This activation promotes second-messenger signaling and subsequently regulates different physiological functions. Another pathway for GPCR signal transduction is mediated by \u03b2-arrestins. The activated receptors can be phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases and recruit \u03b2-arrestins, which terminate signal transduction through G-proteins. Receptors move into clathrin-coated pits with \u03b2-arrestins from cell membranes, which cause receptor internalization and desensitization. Meanwhile, \u03b2-arrestins also serve as a scaffold for numerous signaling molecules that are stimulated by receptor agonists, which initiate a second parallel set of signals27. Traditionally, it was thought that ligand binding stimulated or inhibited all receptor functions to an equal extent, but in recent years, researchers have found \u201cbiased ligands\u201d in many GPCRs28, 29, 30. Perfect biased ligands stimulate one receptor activity without stimulating other known receptor activity. The development of \u03b2-arrestin-biased ligands might provide opportunities for novel therapies31. Our cell-based model provided a tool for the measurement of agonist-promoted interactions between GPCRs and \u03b2-arrestins. Along with assays that measure second-messenger production (for example, Ca2+ or cAMP), our model remains promising in the search for a biased ligand specific to the GPCR signal pathway that can activate only G-protein- or \u03b2-arrestins-mediated signal transduction.",
