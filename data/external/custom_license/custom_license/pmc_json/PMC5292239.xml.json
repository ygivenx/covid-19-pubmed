With a structural complexity vastly exceeding that of proteins and nucleic acids, they act as molecular tags in cell recognition and signaling events. Mammalian glycans form linear and branched chains of variable size and composition yet commonly with sialic acids (Sias) as terminal, surface-exposed residues. In consequence of this topology, Sias are key elements of the glycotopes of many regulatory cellular lectins (Crocker et al., 2007, Schauer, 2009). For the same reason, they have become attachment factors of choice for a range of pathogens including protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses.",

            "text": "Sias occur in a wide variety, their diversity resulting from differences in glycosidic linkage as well as from differential modifications (Deng et al., 2013). In most mammals, humans excluded, the parental Sia N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) can be enzymatically converted to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (Chou et al., 1998, Irie et al., 1998). Another common modification is Sia-O-acetylation substituting the hydroxyl groups at carbon atoms C4, C7, C8, and/or C9 (Kamerling and Gerwig, 2006, Klein and Roussel, 1998) (Figure S1). In lock-and-key interactions, the presence or absence of these O-acetyl moieties can block or promote binding of cellular and microbial lectins, and their controlled addition and removal through sialate-O-acetylesterases (SOAEs) and sialate-O-transferases (SOATs) may thus act as a molecular switch to control downstream processes and events. This principle is illustrated by the regulation of peripheral B cell tolerance. Repression of antigen receptor signaling through Sia-dependent binding of Siglec 2/CD22 to the B cell receptor is modulated by Sia-9-O-acetylation/de-O-acetylation (Cariappa et al., 2009), and defects in SOAE expression may be associated with autoimmunity (Pillai, 2013, Surolia et al., 2010). Defective (de-)O-acetylation of Sias has also been implicated in cancer to correlate with metastatic potential, escape from apoptosis and drug resistance (B\u00fcll et al., 2014, Ghosh et al., 2007, Mukherjee et al., 2008, Parameswaran et al., 2013).",

            "text": "There is limited understanding of how O-acetylation of Sias is regulated, and the role of distinct O-acetylated (O-Ac) Sias in health and disease remains largely unexplored. A major hurdle for advancement of this field is a lack of convenient experimental approaches that would allow detection of, and distinction between, Sia variants in situ. Viruses that use Sias as receptor determinants come with a treasure trove of lectins and sugar-modifying enzymes (Neu et al., 2011). For example, the hemagglutinin-esterase proteins (HEs) of toro-, corona-, and orthomyxo-viruses are envelope glycoproteins that mediate reversible virion attachment to O-Ac-Sias through the concerted action of distinct lectin and receptor-destroying (SOAE) domains (Figure S1A) (de Groot, 2006, Langereis et al., 2009, Langereis et al., 2012, Zeng et al., 2008). Here, we investigated the biochemical and structural properties of toro- and coronavirus HEs with particular focus on their receptor specificity, and their potential use as tools in explorative sialoglycobiology. We demonstrate that the nidovirus \u201cvirolectins\u201d have evolved to bind different O-Ac-Sia variants selectively and with such affinity as to allow detection of distinct O-Ac-sialoglycan populations in mammalian cells and tissues. We show that O-Ac-sialoglycans are expressed differentially in a species-, organ-, tissue-, and cell-type-specific fashion and that their expression is regulated even at the level of the individual cell.",

As a direct test, we performed sp-LBA with BSM, chemo-enzymatically converted to carry 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias exclusively (Figure 1D). To this end, BSM was first digested with excess BCoV HE+ to selectively remove all Sia-9-O-acetyl moieties while leaving 7-O-acetyl groups attached. In result, binding of both BCoV-LUN and PToV-P4 HE0 was lost (Figure 1D), formally demonstrating that Sia-9-O-acetylation is a strict requirement and that 7-mono-O-Ac-Sias do not serve as ligands. Upon pH/temperature-induced C7-to-C9 migration of O-acetyl moieties (Kamerling et al., 1987) as to produce 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias, binding of PToV-P4 HE0 was restored to levels even beyond those in native BSM (note that in native BSM, the amount of 7-O-Ac- and 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias combined is almost twice that of 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias; Tables S2 and S3). Binding of BCoV-LUN HE0, however, was restored only partially (Figure 1D). The results show that PToV-P4 HE0 is a high-specificity lectin for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sia. Conversely, BCoV-Mebus and BCoV-LUN HE0 accept 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias but bind to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias with much higher affinity (Figures 2A and 2B).",

BCoV-LUN HE differs from that of BCoV-Mebus in only seven residues, one of which is in a loop at the rim of the Sia binding site (Figure 2C). This single amino acid variation (T114 in BCoV-Mebus, I114 in BCoV-LUN HE) fully accounts for the observed 3-fold difference in binding affinity toward BSM (Figures 1B and 2D). Apparently, the Thr/Ile substitution does not alter lectin ligand preference for 7,9-di-O- over 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias; as compared to BCoV-Mebus HE, LUN HE displays equally increased affinities for either Sia type (Figure 2A). Based on the position of T114 relative to the bound ligand, its exchange by Ile may affect, directly or indirectly, binding site interactions with the Sia-5-N-acyl moiety. Although not immediately obvious from replacement modeling how this would be achieved, such interactions may raise binding affinity for Sia per se but, as indicated by glycan array analysis (vide infra), also alter the lectin\u2019s relative preference for 5-N-Ac- or 5-N-Gc-Sias.",

The Sia 9-O-Ac group, crucial to receptor binding, docks into a hydrophobic pocket. The vicinity of Sia glycerol atom C8 is crowded such that substitution of an O-Ac moiety for the C8 hydroxyl is not possible without introducing steric strain. Hence, the structure of the BCoV HE receptor binding site appears incompatible with binding of 8-O-Ac-Sias. There is, however, ample space to accommodate modifications at C7. Moreover, modeling of Neu5,7,9Ac3 in the lectin binding site revealed potential interactions between the Sia-7-O-Ac moiety and the side chains of F211 and L161 that could contribute to the lectin\u2019s preference for 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias (Figure 2E). Accordingly, L161A substitution strongly decreased binding to BSM, yet, as demonstrated for BCoV-LUN HE, high-affinity binding to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias was affected more than low-affinity binding to 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias (Figure 2A). In effect, ligand fine specificity was lost, the substitution causing the BCoV-LUN HE L161A mutant to now bind each receptor type equally poorly.",

We therefore systematically compared the binding properties of the HEs of BCoV-LUN, BCoV-Mebus, ECoV-NC99, and PToV-P4 toward paired (Neu5Ac- or Neu5Gc-based, and \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6-linked) 9-O-Ac and non-O-Ac-sialoglycans by glycan microarray analysis (Padler-Karavani et al., 2011, Padler-Karavani et al., 2012). The results, summarized in Figures 3\nA and S3, indicate that all four lectins accept both \u03b12-3- and \u03b12-6-linked 9-O-Ac-Sias, though with noted exceptions apparently related to overall glycan structure/composition. The most prominent and consistent difference was in the relative binding preference for Sias, differentially modified at C5. The PToV-P4 and ECoV-NC99 lectins displayed a clear binding bias and strongly favored 5-N-Ac-Sias. Conversely, BCoV-LUN and Mebus HEs more readily accepted both 5-N-Ac- and 5-N-Gc-Sias, albeit depending on the underlying glycan structure. Of the two lectins, BCoV-LUN HE bound more strongly to all ligands, in accordance with sp-LBA data (Figure 1B), and displayed a higher apparent affinity for 5-N-Gc-Sias. The results provide a clue to the observed difference between BCoV and ECoV-NC99 HEs in sp-LBA (Figure 1B). BSM predominantly carries sialyl-Tn-type O-glycans (Kozak et al., 2012), represented in the microarray by glycans #23 and #24. In contrast to the BCoV HEs, ECoV-NC99 HE binds 9-O-Ac-5-N-Ac-sialyl Tn exclusively (glycan #23; Figure 3A) and not to its 5-N-glycolylated variant (glycan #24) and hence would recognize only a subpopulation of the BCoV HE glycotopes.",

Sias with multiple O-Ac moieties are absent, as are multi-antennary sialoglycans. Furthermore, differences in binding as detected by glycan array analysis may occur from differences in presentation and/or flexibility of the printed glycans and from how such variables would affect multivalent lectin-Sia interactions (Padler-Karavani et al., 2012). Finally, the biophysical and biological consequences of modest differences in binding preference as detected by glycan array analysis are difficult to predict. Such differences may be augmented and of major significance during multivalent HE-mediated virion attachment in vivo. Conversely, viral attachment to suboptimal ligands may well occur, if such glycans are present in high local densities. At any rate, the 9-O-Ac-sialoglycan populations recognized by the PToV, BCoV, and ECoV virolectins cannot be defined in absolute terms. Their binding profiles, while unique, partially overlap. PToV-P4 would seem to be the most specific in that it displays a strong predilection for 9-mono-O-acetylated, 5-N-acetylated Sias, and BCoV-LUN HE the least (for a summary of binding profiles, see Figure 3B).",

The present study extends previous work in that it builds on a comprehensive set of viral lectins and SOAEs, extensively characterized both in terms of structure and ligand/substrate fine specificity. In combination with MHV-S HE0, the virolectins of PToV-P4, ECoV-NC99, and BCoV-LUN should allow detection in situ of 4-O-Ac-Sias, three distinct populations of 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans and combinations thereof. For convenience and clarity, we refer to the virolectins and their glycotopes according to virus strain designation (MHV-S, P4, LUN, and NC99) in the remainder of the text.",

HRT-18 sublineages (n = 3) obtained through single-cell cloning by limiting dilution were indistinguishable from the parental cell line, indicating that the observed Sia expression patterns did not result from genetic heterogeneity (data not shown). Synthesis of cell-surface P4- and LUN-type 9-O-Ac-Sias in HRT-18 cells was sensitive to benzyl N-acetyl-\u03b1-D-galactosaminide (benzyl-GalNAc) but resistant to N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), N-butyl-deoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGB), and N-butyl-deoxymannojirimycin (NB-DMJ), suggesting that they are attached mainly to O-linked glycans rather than to N-linked sugars or glycolipids (Figure 4B; Gouyer et al., 2001, Platt et al., 1994). As a rule, P4 glycotopes were most abundant and those of NC99 least. Most cells expressing NC99 glycotopes also expressed LUN-type Sias, and in turn, most cells stained by LUN also produced Sias detectable by P4 (Figure 4A). However, relative expression levels of each 9-O-Ac-Sia subtype varied widely from one cell to another, and cells that would seem to express LUN- or NC99-type Sias predominantly or even exclusively were also readily detected (Figure 4A). These findings demonstrate that P4, LUN, and NC99 can detect and distinguish between distinct 9-O-Ac-Sia populations also in cultured cells.",

These Sias, however, were found exclusively intracellularly (Figures 4C and S4B). Why HeLa and HEK293T cells do not express detectable levels of 9-O-Ac-Sias at the plasma membrane is not known. Clearly, an apparent failure of virolectins to bind to the cell surface as determined by L-IFA does not necessarily mean absence of their cognate ligands. Bearing the dynamics of lectin-ligand interactions in mind, in particular the vast incremental effect of ligand valency on apparent lectin affinity (Dam and Brewer, 2010, Dam et al., 2007), the virolectins may predominantly bind to multivalent glycoconjugates with clustered binding sites. Thus, the lack of cell-surface staining in HeLa and HEK293T cells might be explained from a lack of expression of specific cell surface mucin-type glycoproteins that are selectively (and profusely) decorated with O-Ac-Sias.",

Whereas in murine LR7 cells, 4-O-Ac-Sias were detected exclusively intracellularly (data not shown), in equine cell lines, both intracellular and cell-surface expression were seen (Figures 5 and S4C). Approximately 1% of these cells expressed 4-O-Ac-Sias on the surface, whereas in 3%\u20135%, this Sia was detected only intracellularly (Figure 5A). L-IFA double staining showed that Ederm cells also express LUN- and P4-type 9-O-Ac-Sias, albeit again at relative levels that varied from one individual cell to another (Figures 5A and 5B).

AuS-resistant 9-O-Ac-Sias were present invariably in cells that also produced 4-O-Ac-Sias. Given that 4-O-acetylation protects Sias against cleavage by AuS and other sialidases (Corfield et al., 1986), we hypothesized that the AuS-resistant Sias detected by P4 were both 9- and 4-O-acetylated. Accordingly, in cells treated with AuS and sialate-4-O-acetylesterase (MHV-S HE+), all 9-O-Ac-Sias were removed (Figure 5A), providing compelling evidence that equine cells produce 4,9-di-O- in addition to 4-mono-O-Ac-Sias. The results (1) show that nidovirus virolectins can indeed be used to detect and distinguish between different forms of 4-O- and 9-O-Ac-sialoglycans in individual cells and (2) illustrate how novel types of multiply modified Sias can be discovered and demonstrated in situ, by using viral and microbial SOAEs and sialidases in combination with L-IFA.",

            "text": "9-O-Ac-Sias occur in various tissues in both human and mouse, albeit more profusely and widespread in the latter species (Table 1; Figures S5 and S6). Among noted species differences in Sia expression, murine, but not human, erythrocytes are covered with LUN and P4-type 9-O-Ac-Sias. However, in various organs and cell types, humans and mice display similar 9-O-Ac-Sia profiles, with P4 and LUN glycotopes differentially expressed in comparable fashion. For example, in the prostate, epithelial cells lining the ducts display low-level expression of P4- and high-level expression of LUN-type Sias (Figures S5 and S6). In both species, secreted colonic mucus contains high levels of P4- and LUN-type Sias, but the mucin-producing goblet cells predominantly stain with P4 (Figures S5 and S6). Differential expression of P4 and LUN glycotopes was most conspicuous in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum (Figure 6\n, S5, and S6). In human and mouse, individual Purkinje cells differed widely in 9-O-Ac-Sia profile, with cells seemingly devoid of 9-O-Ac-Sias, adjacent to ones containing large quantities of P4- and/or LUN-type 9-O-Ac-Sias in granular inclusions in the cell body (Figure 6D). Even within single cells, P4- and LUN-type 9-O-Ac-Sias were often found in different compartments (Figure 6E). Most strikingly, in the mouse, the dendritic arbors of 9-O-Ac-Sia-producing Purkinje neurons stained for LUN-type 9-O-Ac-Sias only, creating a striated, bar code-like pattern in the molecular layer in the cerebellar cortex (Figures 6A\u20136C, 6F, and S5; note the robust staining of RBCs by P4). This pattern was less conspicuous in the human cerebellum, but also here, dendritic arbors stained with LUN and not with P4 (Figure S6). NC99- and LUN-staining of Purkinje cells resulted in identical patterns in serial sections of mouse cerebellum (Figure 6F), arguing against the lack of P4-binding resulting from exclusive expression of 5-N-Gc-Sias (Figure 3). In fact, Neu5Gc is exceedingly rare even in the murine brain (Davies and Varki, 2013) and completely absent in humans (Chou et al., 1998). To test whether lack of P4 binding was due to prevalent Sia-7,9-di-O-acetylation in Purkinje cells, sections of mouse cerebellum were enzymatically depleted for 9-O-Ac-Sias while preserving 7-O-Ac-Sias. In consequence, staining of Purkinje cells and RBCs by both P4 and LUN was lost. Subsequent pH/temperature-induced C7-to-C9 migration of the remaining Sia-7-O-Ac moieties restored staining of RBCs by P4, but saliently, that by LUN as well. While these findings provide independent confirmation that erythrocytes do express 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias (presenting a source for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias upon experimentally induced C7-to-9-O-Ac migration), they also show that in tissue sections, under the conditions applied, LUN binds 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias too (Figure 6F). Importantly, the conditions that restored Sia 9-O-acetylation on RBCs did not generate P4 glycotopes in Purkinje cell dendrites, nor salvaged LUN binding. It would thus appear that the Sias in the mouse cerebellum are mainly 9-mono-O-acetylated and that the differential staining of Purkinje cells by P4 and LUN must be ascribed to a particular glycan structure and/or to Sia modifications, additional to 9-O-acetylation, that are tolerated by LUN, but not by P4. Although the LUN glycotopes in the cerebellum await definitive identification, our findings do underscore the diversity and complexity of naturally occurring O-Ac-sialoglycans and their cell(-type)-specific differential expression. It is fair to assume that like the virolectins used here, cellular lectins distinguish between these Sia populations and that regulation of lectin binding, through controlled Sia-O-acetylation/de-O-acetylation, may have far-reaching biological effects and consequences.",

Here, we demonstrate that nidoviruses are even more fastidious with respect to Sia receptor usage than appreciated so far. For all nidovirus HEs studied, the ligand specificity and SOAE substrate preference are in close accord (Figures 3B and S2C), indicative of co-evolution of lectin and esterase domains. Apparently, Sia subtype preference correlates with viral host tropism. The HE proteins of PToV-Markelo and -P4 are highly divergent, with only 77% identity in their ectodomains, yet both display a preference for 9-mono-O-Ac-Sias. In contrast, the HEs of BCoV and those of two distinct BToV lineages (represented by strains Breda and B150), all preferentially bind to 7,9-di-O-acetylated ligands instead (Figure 3B). It would seem that in toroviruses and lineage A betacoronaviruses, HE selectivity for O-Ac-Sia receptor subtypes arose as an adaptation to the \u201csialomes\u201d of the target tissues in their respective hosts and that the shared preference of bovine corona- and toroviruses for 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sias resulted from convergent evolution.",

One of our most striking observations is the phenotypic heterogeneity among individual cells of homogenous clonal cell lines. Cells differed not only in the extent to which they expressed O-Ac-Sias but also in the types of O-Ac-Sias produced. Apparently, even in populations of tissue culture cells, cell-to-cell variation occurs in the expression of enzymes required for the biosynthesis or degradation of O-Ac-Sias and/or of the glycoconjugates that are carry these sugars. This cell-to-cell variability may be attributed to stochasticity (\u201cnoisy\u201d gene expression) but perhaps more likely arises from deterministic spatiotemporal influences such as population context and/or cellular crowding (Snijder and Pelkmans, 2011). Indeed, O-Ac-Sia-expressing cells tend to occur in islets (Figure 4A). HRT-18 subpopulations, selected by lectin-MACS for O-Ac-Sia surface expression or lack thereof, reverted to Sia heterogeneity over time (\u223c7 days) and a limited number of cell generations (Figure 4D), reminiscent of the short-term phenotypic memory seen in other examples of cell-to-cell variability (Mariani et al., 2010, Sigal et al., 2006). Our findings raise questions regarding the triggers that induce or prevent Sia-O-acetylation in individual cells but also offer ways and means to study this phenomenon and the mechanisms involved. On a more technical note, our observations illustrate the intricacies of (sialo)glycobiology and underline the pitfalls and limitations of functional glycomics approaches based upon averaging sialoglycan content of cell populations and whole tissue samples.",

The other observation of Neu4,5Ac2 and 9-O-lactylated Neu4,5Ac2 in human erythrocytes (Bulai et al., 2003) as yet awaits independent confirmation. We cannot exclude that 4-O-Ac-Sias are expressed infrequently, in concentrations below our detection levels, and/or specifically in distinct types of tissues and cells absent from our human tissue arrays. Yet, the data lead us to consider that humans might not produce this type of Sia after all. Such a deficiency would not be without precedent: defective synthesis of Neu5Gc sets us apart even from our closest non-human relatives (Chou et al., 2002).",
