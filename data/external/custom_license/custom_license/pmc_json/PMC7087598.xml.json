            "text": "Bats (Order Chiroptera) are the source of a number of emerging pathogenic viruses of animal and public health significance, including ebolaviruses, SARS-like coronaviruses, and henipaviruses (Halpin et al. 2000; Chua et al. 2000; Li et al. 2005; Calisher et al. 2006; Pourrut et al. 2009; Ge et al. 2013). In Australia, fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) have been identified as the natural host of Hendra virus, a novel and potentially fatal zoonotic virus responsible for mortality or morbidity in about 80 horses and 7 humans since it was first described in 1994 (Murray et al. 1995; Halpin et al. 2000). Understanding Hendra virus infection dynamics in flying-foxes and the contributing risk factors is fundamental to elaborating the disease ecology of the virus and thus effective exposure risk management in horses and humans. Previous studies have suggested that a range of physiological and ecological factors constitute risk factors for Hendra virus infection in flying-foxes (Field 2005; Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011), including physiological stress associated with reproduction and sub-optimal nutritional (Plowright et al. 2008). However, to rigorously investigate the putative association between stress and Hendra virus infection dynamics in flying-foxes, a robust method of measuring stress in free-living flying-foxes is needed.",

However, little work has been done on glucocorticoid dynamics in flying-foxes and there are currently few recognised approaches to measuring hormone levels and interpreting changes in terms of physiological stress. Fundamentally, a non-stressful method of sampling is needed to validly measure physiological stress in free-living wildlife populations, to avoid measuring the stress response to the capture and sampling event itself (Reeder et al. 2004a).",

Widmaier et al.

This variation is not unexpected, and is likely due to physiological differences between individuals, species and times of urine collection, the latter plausibly reflecting available food and water resources at that time. In addition, the pooled nature of the samples means that each sample potentially contains urine from multiple bats of various physiological and nutritional status. However, for valid comparison and interpretation, it is essential to ensure that hormone concentrations are corrected for concentration of urine. This has typically been done by correcting measured cortisol concentration based on urinary creatinine concentration, which is constant in urine. Miller et al. (2004) used USG to measure urine concentration and found it as reliable as creatinine in human populations. We trialled both approaches and found little difference between the two methods. Thus, we chose to use USG to correct urinary cortisol measurements, because it was a simpler, faster and more cost efficient method.",
