In the immunocompromised populations, particularly those undergoing chemotherapy for malignancy and solid organ and hematopoeitic stem cell transplant patients, viral respiratory infections can cause high rates of morbidity and mortality. Few antiviral therapies exist that provide benefit against these pathogens, but new therapies are under investigation [1, 2]. However, there remain limited data about the efficacy of many of these new agents in immunocompromised populations. This review describes the currently published literature regarding novel antiviral agents for use against respiratory viruses in the immunocompromised host.",

In one review of patients from 18 different states, only 3 of 31 (9 %) patients treated under eIND during the early phase of the pandemic were transplant patients: 2 patients with solid organ transplants and 1 with hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [5\u2022].

Five of 12 patients lived; baseline characteristics did not predict mortality in this cohort. Finally, several case reports describe treatment with peramivir. In one case, a pediatric renal transplant patient with severe oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H1N1 recovered following peramivir therapy; however, this patient also had \u201caggressive critical care support\u201d and reduction in his immunosuppression [7]. In 1 HSCT patient, peramivir was associated with recovery from severe pandemic influenza A H1N1, but peramivir use was concurrent with lymphocyte recovery and oseltamivir use and was preceded by triple combination antiviral therapy with oseltamivir, oral ribavirin, and oral amantadine, as well as inhaled ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin [8]. There were no detected oseltamivir H275Y resistance mutations. Additionally, the role of peramivir in the management of patients with documented resistance to oseltamivir has been called into question. In 1 allogeniec HSCT patient with oseltamivir-resistant virus due to neuraminidase mutation H275Y, virus replication continued despite peramivir therapy [9]. Overall, the limited data do not allow conclusions about the efficacy of peramivir in immunocompromised populations [10].",

There are limited data on inhaled zanamivir in transplant populations, but the tolerability and outcomes suggest that it is a reasonable option, although further studies are needed [10]. Investigational IV zanamivir has been available on a compassionate-use basis in the setting of failure of other antivirals, with contraindication to inhaled zanamivir, or as part of a clinical trial. Failure to absorb oseltamivir and the development of oseltamivir-resistant (specifically, H275Y) mutations were reported as indications for usage [10\u201312]. In a retrospective study of IV zanamivir in critically ill patients with pandemic influenza A H1N1 who had already received at least 3 days of oseltamivir prior to IV zanamivir, 8 of 13 (62 %) were immunocompromised [11]. Seven of the patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 5 patients (63 %) died. Several case reports of pediatric immunocompromised hosts, including those with HSCT, leukemia, and liver transplantation, appear in the literature, predominantly with oseltamivir-resistant pandemic influenza H1N1 viral isolates. While survival results are mixed for these patients, most report a decrease in the viral load as evaluated by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) threshold cycle values. Most of the remaining case reports relate to pediatric transplant patients, who had mixed survival results [13\u201316]. Data on IV zanamivir in the immunocompromised population remain scant, but there may be benefit for its use in oseltamivir-resistant influenza infections.",

The mechanism of action of DAS181 is to cleave the terminal sialic acid linkages on the host cells to reduce binding and infectivity of the virus [18, 20]. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that DAS181 is active against oseltamivir-resistant strains of influenza. Currently, it has been studied in animal models and one phase II trial [20, 21\u2022, 22\u201324]. In the phase II study, the patients were infected with seasonal influenza A H3N2, pandemic influenza A 2009 H1N1, or influenza B [20]. DAS181 was associated with a statistically significant reduction in viral load from days 1\u20133 in these otherwise generally healthy patients. One death occurred in a female patient with previously undiagnosed HIV infection, who expired from respiratory failure, with severe pneumonia and H. influenzae and S. aureus isolated from sputum cultures. Overall, further evaluation of DAS181 and influenza infection is necessary, particularly in immunocompromised populations (see below for data on the management of parainfluenza virus).",

Ribavirin orally is ~45 %\u201365 % absorbed without food. The half-life is ~12 days when administered over time, and there is extensive accumulation in all tissues [25]. It has activity against influenza, measles, West Nile virus, RSV, and other viruses. When oral ribavirin became available, Pelaez described its use in conjunction with steroids in 5 adult lung transplant recipients, finding oral therapy less costly than aerosolization; this intervention was not directly compared with placebo or other formulations of ribavirin [26]. Additionally, a comparison between outcomes for lung transplant recipients receiving oral (n = 6) and inhaled (n = 15) ribavirin in conjunction with steroids and IVIG was performed at a single center. There were no significant differences reported for survival or BOS development/progression at 6 months postinfection in this cohort [27]. Studies assessing the concentration of oral ribavirin in lung fluid in transplant patients have not been conducted. Despite limited data on its efficacy in clearing RSV infection in solid organ transplant (SOT), ribavirin, especially in the aerosolized form, has additionally been evaluated in conjunction with other therapies, including steroids, IVIG, and palivizumab (see below), and remains a standard part of many local treatment protocols.",

In the first group, 6 HSCT patients without RSV received palivizumab, noting a serum half-life of 22.4 days. An additional 15 HSCT patients with RSV (URTI = 3, LRTI = 12) received palivizumab in addition to aerosolized ribavirin. Palivizumab was cleared more rapidly in the RSV-infected group with a half-life of 10.7 days. All patients with URTI recovered without progression to LRTI, while 10 patients with LRTI survived past the 28-day study period. In addition, palivizumab given to 16 HSCT patients along with infection prevention measures, including patient cohorting, visitor screening, and hand hygiene, was successful when administered prophylactically during a nosocomial outbreak of RSV [30]. Finally, palivizumab was used as part of a multidrug regimen that included inhaled ribavirin, steroid, and IVIG in 23 lung transplant recipients with RSV [31]. Forced expiratory volumes in one second (FEV1) after treatment were similar to baseline. However, progression of BOS was not impacted by RSV therapy; patients with higher-grade BOS at infection had more rapid declines in FEV1 over the follow-up period compared to those without BOS at infection.",

AdVs cause both disseminated and localized disease, such as pneumonia in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed populations [45, 47\u201349]. Nucleoside analogs ribavirin, ganciclovir, and cidofovir have shown in vitro activity to AdV; however, only cidofovir has been recommended as treatment for AdV infection [50]. Most recently, a lipid-conjugate, oral form of cidofovir, CMX001 (Chimerix, Durham, NC), has been studied in both HSCT and SOT. First, under an eIND program to treat severe AdV infections [51\u2022\u2022], 57 children and adults were enrolled, 83 % (47) with HSCT and 12 % (7) after SOT. While 53 % survived to study completion, 9 deaths (6 with disseminated infection and 3 with localized infection) were attributed to AdV disease, while 13 others expired due to other causes. The survival of those with localized lung disease was not reported. Florescu reported on 17 patients who received CMX001 as salvage therapy for disseminated AdV, 13 of which were available for analysis (11 HSCT, 1 SOT, 1 severe combined immunodeficiency CID) [52\u2022\u2022]. Respiratory disease was diagnosed in 3 patients, of which 1 patient expired secondary to AdV pneumonia. Nine patients experienced a >99 % decrease in plasma viral load by the end of treatment or follow-up period. In patients who responded to CMX001 therapy with decreased viral load, survival was improved from median 196 days versus 54.5 days (p = .4), as compared with nonresponders. CMX001 has been well-tolerated and should be explored further as a therapeutic option for AdV infections in immunocompromised populations.",
