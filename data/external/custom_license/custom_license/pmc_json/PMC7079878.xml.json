            "text": "Natural products of various sources, particularly from plants and marines have been regarded as a precious alternative to modern medicine (Lope Pihie et al., 2012). In recent years, a number of natural products isolated from Chinese herbs have been found to inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, suppress angiogenesis, retard metastasis, and enhance chemotherapy, exhibiting anticancer potential both in vitro and in vivo (Tan et al., 2011; Hostanska et al., 2007). The essential oils (EOs) extracted from herbs might have more therapeutic or preventive activity than alone, because the different components in herbs may have synergistic activities or buffering toxic effects (Yu et al., 2012). Mostly plant-derived EOs consist of chemical components such as terpenoids including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives. These compounds have the ability to easily diffuse across cell membrane to induce biological reactions (Al Nomaani et al., 2013). Plant EOs and their components have multiple and varied biological activities such as antiparasitic, insecticidal, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antioxidant properties (Jeong et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010; da Silva, 2004; Prabuseenivasan et al., 2006; Namita and Mukesh, 2012). For more than a decade, there has been a considerable interest in screening plant EOs for medical use all over the world (Lin et al., 2012). They have received much attention to preventing plant and animal diseases, as well as to preventing oxidative damage (Rubalya and Neelamegam, 2012; Okigbo et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Earlier studies done revealed that the plants of Dryopteridaceae had many biological properties and pharmacological functions (Herrmann et al., 2011). Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith is mainly grown in China, Korea, and Japan and has been used as a medicinal plant for a long time in the Orient (Choi, 2013; Yang et al., 2013a). And it belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family which has 14 genera and 1700 species distributed in the temperate and tropical zones all over the world (Suksathan et al., 2010; Kessler, 2006; Barrington, 2012). Many species of Dryopteridaceae family are rich in fatty acids, phloroglucinols, terpenoids, steroids, and flavonoids, and are well-known medicinal plants (Ito et al., 2000). The roots of C. fortumei (J.) Smith are used as folk medicines for treatment of migraine, cancer, acute and chronic pharyngitis, and influenza in China (Kapadia et al., 1996). Also, the herb was used to cure severe acute respiratory syndrome, a life-threatening viral respiratory illness believed to be caused by a coronavirus (Zhao et al., 2007). It was reported that it exhibited a variety of bioactivities such as cytotoxicity (Yang et al., 2013b), antibacterial (Song et al., 2008), antifungal (Jahan et al., 2010), and antioxidant (Yang et al., 2013c) effects. Recently, researchers found that extracts of its roots processed significant antitumor activities via inducing cell apoptosis (Yang et al., 2013a). Moreover, Choi et al. reported that methanol extract of its roots appeared to inhibit tyrosinase activity and melanin production in melan-a cells and it could exhibit depigmenting ability on Ultra violet-induced hyper pigmentation in brown guinea pig skin (Choi, 2013). In our previous work, we investigated the chemical constituents of the plant systematically, and tested the biological activities of its extracts and compounds. The results revealed that its major physiologically active ingredients included triterpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids (Yang et al., 2013a). However, few studies have analyzed the chemical composition of EO of C. fortumei (J.) Smith leaves, and evaluated its biological activity.",
