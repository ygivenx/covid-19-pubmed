The epizootic form of the disease has mortality as high as 100 % in pigs younger than 2 weeks of age and infected preweaning piglets may die of severe dehydration [7, 13]. Occurrences of TGE have become more sporadic. The disease is still reported on an occasional basis from parts of Europe, North America and Asia. Wild and domestic carnivores (foxes, dogs, possibly mink) and cats seroconvert to TGEV and are suggested as potential subclinical carriers of TGEV, serving as reservoirs between seasonal (winter) epidemics [11].",

The aim of present study was to generate new information in respect to TGEV strains isolated from non-porcine host. In this report, the N gene was cloned by RT-PCR from a recently isolated TGEV (HYM-09) from dogs in Heilongjiang province, China. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of the N gene were compared with other 12 references strains derived from different regions and/or countries. Correspondingly, a phylogenetic tree was constructed and analyzed according to their N gene sequences. These will establish the primary foundation of understanding the mutations of non-porcine TGEVs.",

The Swine testicle cell (STC) line was grown as monolayer in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, USA) containing 10 % fetal calf serum (GIBCO, USA) and 5 % CO2 in air. The STCs were infected by the treated suspect TGEV isolate (HYM-09), and obvious cytopathic effects (CPE) were found at the 8th passage, however, the cells in the negative control group were in normal state. Fluorescent antibody test showed that specific cytoplasmic fluorescence was found in ST cells using FITC-labeled Rabbit Anti-Swine IgG Antibody (Bipec Biopharma, USA). The TCID50 value of HYM-09 (1 \u00d7 10\u22123.85/0.05 ml) was measured using Reed\u2013Muench method, and its neutralization index (NI) was 71. In addition, the blocking ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test was done to differentiate TGEV and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which showed the experimental result of HYM-09 was positive, however, the result of control group was negative. All the results demonstrated that the virus (HYM-09) was TGEV.",
