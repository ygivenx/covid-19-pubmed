Effector T cells are critical for the defense against pathogens, but inappropriate or poorly regulated T cell responses also induce inflammatory disorders and pathological damage. Thus, T cell response is stringently controlled under physiological conditions. Notably, IFN-\u03b3 is an effector cytokine produced by Th1 cells and CD8 T cells and plays a critical role in immune responses to microbial infection. IFN-\u03b3 also plays an essential role in the homeostatic control of effector T cells in order to minimize immunopathology [3, 4]. There is a progressive expansion of T cells in IFN-\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with mycobacteria [5]. After Listeria infection, the frequency of antigen-specific T cells is higher in IFN-\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice than in wild-type mice [6]. Severe T cell-mediated immunopathology is observed in IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice infected by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [7]. Failure to suppress the expansion of the activated T cells in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 pathway leads to more severe encephalitis in mice [8]. Similarly, IFN-\u03b3 or its receptor deficient mice exhibit an increased susceptibility to MHV-induced hepatitis [9\u201311]. It has been hypothesized that the increased susceptibility is due to uncontrolled response to virus infection. However, the molecular and cellular basis underlying the impaired responses is largely unknown.",

Although IL-17 was initially identified as a pathogenic cytokine in autoimmunity [12\u201315], increasing evidence suggests that IL-17 also plays a critical role in controlling microbial infection, especially intracellular bacterial infection [16\u201318]. IL-17 promotes recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection, inducing proliferation of enterocytes and production of antibacterial defensins [19, 20]. Indeed, IL-17 is known to be induced and required for the host protection against Klebsiella pneumoniae [21], Citrobacter rodentium [22], and Candida albicans [23]. Hence, Th17 cells are an integral part of an antibacterial immunity. In contrast, the role of Th17 cells in viral infection is less clear. Previous studies indicate that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of Th17 cells in the ileal mucosa [24]. Similarly, IL-17 is negatively regulated by Epstein\u2013Barr virus-induced gene 3 [25]. Th17 cells are suggested to correlate with the severity of liver damage during chronic HBV infection [26]. These previous studies suggest possible connections between IL-17 and virus infection.",

Immunity and pathology to hepatotropic MHV infection is specifically analyzed in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 pathway. Our results show that MHV-A59-induced Th17 response is associated with immunopathology in acute hepatitis. Increased severity of hepatitis in IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice correlates with exaggerated reactivity of Th17 cells. A blockade of IL-17 significantly decreases MHV-induced inflammation as well as liver damage. We further show that IFN-\u03b3 induces apoptosis of Th17 cells.

Flow cytometry analysis showed that Th17 cells from wild-type mice, but not IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice, expressed IFN-\u03b3R (Fig. 6a). Because IFN-\u03b3 was known to induce apoptosis of activated T cells [3, 4, 34, 35], we analyzed whether IFN-\u03b3 might have a direct role in inducing apoptosis of Th17 cells. Thus, OVA-specific Th17 cells were generated from DO11.10 transgenic CD4+ T cells by stimulation with OVA peptide for 5 days. Following OVA stimulation, a large fraction of Th17 cells differentiated and then underwent apoptosis. Addition of IFN-\u03b3 increased their apoptosis (Fig. 6b). Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 slightly decreased Th17 cells apoptosis (Fig. 6b). Because little IFN-\u03b3 was secreted by Th17 cells, IFN-\u03b3-induced apoptosis of Th17 cells may happen through a paracrine effect. The ex vivo experiment showed that there was more apoptosis of Th17 cells in wild-type mice than that in IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6c). These results suggest that IFN-\u03b3 could restrict Th17 cell expansion by inducing their apoptosis, and the dysfunction of this pathway is probably responsible for the exacerbated Th17 induction during MHV-A59 infection in IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice.\n\n",

Total CD4+ T cells, including the antigen-primed CD4+ T cells, were adoptively transferred into naive wild-type recipients and then challenged with MHV-A59. At 4 dpi, the proportions of Th17 cells in liver were increased in wild-type recipients receiving IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7a). Consistently, wild-type mice given IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 CD4+ T cells had a more visible weight loss and liver damage than mice given wild-type CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7b). In addition, adoptive transfer of IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 CD4+ T cells led to increased production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and IL-6 in the liver (Fig. 7c). These results further support the notion that augmented Th17 response is a major contributor to MHV-induced immunopathology in IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice.\n\n",

Mortality without supportive management and/or liver transplantation is over 70%, especially in children. The disease is characterized by massive hepatic necrosis associated with failure of hepatic regeneration. Using the model of MHV-A59-induced fulminant hepatitis in this study, we investigated the involvement and potential function of Th17 cells during MHV infection. Although Th17 cells have been implicated in chronic inflammation, here we show that MHV-A59 triggers Th17 response during acute infection, which is associated with pathogenesis. Without IFN-\u03b3R signaling pathway, Th17 cells are exaggerated and their effector cytokine IL-17 stimulated production of proinflammatory mediators, leading to pathogenesis and hepatic injury. In addition to antagonizing Th17 development, we find that IFN-\u03b3 also induces apoptosis of Th17 cells both in vitro and ex vivo. Thus, IFN-\u03b3 negatively regulates Th17 cells generation and survival during MHV-A59 infection.",

In addition, IL-17R signaling modulates the host response to herpes simplex virus corneal infection at early time-points post infection, actively promoting corneal inflammation [37]. Respiratory syncytial virus infection in the absence of STAT1 results in augmented IL-17 levels as well as enhanced airway dysfunction [38]. Mice lacking both of the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin develop high levels of IL-17-secreting CD8+ T cells following LCMV infection, leading to a progressive inflammatory and wasting syndrome [39]. Th17 cells also contributed to the liver damage during chronic HBV infection [26]. Therefore, it is conceivable that Th17 cells could cause pathogenesis in addition to the protective property in many viral infections [40]. Consistently, in our study MHV-A59-induced Th17 cells contribute to detrimental inflammation and liver disease, implying the involvement of Th17 cells in fulminant viral hepatitis in clinical settings. In particular, MHV-A59 infection drives exacerbated Th17 response in IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice, correlating with prolonged viral persistence. This may be mediated by inhibition of T cell cytotoxicity by IL-17, permitting sustained viral infection, similar to what has been observed in the pathogenesis of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease [41].",

The induction of type I IFN-s by viral infection may constrain Th17 development [42]. In addition, innate anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 elicited by HCV suppress Ag-specific Th17 cells [43]. Notably, immunity to viruses is ascribed to Th1 responses whose production of IFN-\u03b3 could antagonize Th17 cells [44, 45]. Extensive studies have indicated the inhibitory effect of IFN-\u03b3 on differentiation processes of Th17 cells [46]. Herein, our results demonstrate IFN-\u03b3 also affects Th17 apoptosis. It is also observed that Th17 cells are markedly depleted in SIV-infected rhesus macaques [24]. In our study, compared with susceptible IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice that display vigorous Th17 induction and severe liver pathology, resistant wild-type mice have limited Th17 response and disease progression. IL-17 neutralization significantly delayed death of IFN\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice, although it had little effect on the death of wild-type mice. This suggests a stringent restriction of Th17 cells during viral infection in wild-type mice.",

IFN-\u03b3R expression on Th17 cells was detected by staining with a PE-labeled Ab against CD119 (black line). A PE-labeled isotype-matched Ab was used as a control (filled). b Sorted CD4+ T cells from Do11.10 mice were stimulated with or without OVA peptide in presence of 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-6 and 3 ng/ml human TGF-\u03b2 plus recombinant mouse IL-2. 50 ng/ml mouse recombinant IFN-\u03b3 or 10 \u03bcg/ml neutralizing rat Abs R46A2 (anti-IFN-\u03b3) was applied as indicated 1 day post stimulation. Five days later, cells were restimulated with PMA/ionomycin and subjected to intracellular cytokine staining for IL-17. Apoptosis of Th17 cells was determined by FITC-labeled TUNEL staining. A FITC-labeled isotype-matched Ab was used as a control. Ratios of apoptotic to nonapoptotic Th17 cells were statistically analyzed. c Hepatic lymphocytes were isolated from MHV-A59 infected IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212 mice (open bar) and wild-type mice (closed bar) at different time points post infection. After stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, cells were subjected for IL-17 staining and TUNEL assay. Apoptosis of Th17 cells was determined by FITC-labeled TUNEL staining as described above. Ratios of apoptotic Th17 cells were statistically analyzed",

Twenty days later, the mice were sacrificed and immunized CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens. Naive wild-type mice received 5 \u00d7 106 immunized CD4+ T cells 1 day prior to infection and then challenged with 5 \u00d7 105 PFU MHV-A59/mouse. Hepatic lymphocytes from the IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212\n\u2265 WT and WT \u2265 WT recipients were isolated 4 dpi. Following stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, cells were subjected to intracellular cytokine staining. The frequencies of IL-17-expressing CD4+ T cells in liver were measured. b Body weight of the IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212\n\u2265 WT (open triangle) and WT \u2265 WT mice (closed square) was monitored daily post MHV-A59 infection. ALT activities in serum of the recipients on days 2 and 4 were analyzed. More severe immunopathology and liver disease were observed in IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212\n\u2265 WT mice (open bar) than that in WT \u2265 WT ones (closed bar). c Livers of the recipients were collected 4 dpi, and levels of local cytokines were quantified by CBA mouse inflammation kit (BD). The inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and IL-6 were significantly elevated in the infected livers of IFN-\u03b3R\u2212/\u2212\n\u2265 WT mice (open bar) compared with WT \u2265 WT ones (closed bar)",
