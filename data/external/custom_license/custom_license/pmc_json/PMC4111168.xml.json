The ages of the animals ranged from 4 to 15 years. The abattoirs also served the neighboring countries of Chad, Niger, and the Central African Republic. In Tunisia, serum samples from 204 dromedaries that were 1 to 16 years of age were collected in 3 provinces in 2009 and 2013 (Figure 1, panel B). Samples were collected from 155 dromedaries in Sidi Bouzid Province from 27 herds that were kept for meat production and from 39 dromedaries in Kebili Province from 16 herds that were kept for tourist rides; samples from both provinces had originally been collected for a study investigating the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Samples were collected from 10 dromedaries from Sousse Province that were kept for meat production because they were suspected of being infected with Trypanosoma evansi. In Ethiopia, samples from 188 dromedaries, 1 to 13 years of age, were collected as part of a study evaluating the presence of toxoplasmosis and respiratory tract diseases in 3 provinces (Afar, n = 118; Somalia, n = 11; and Oromia, n = 59; Figure 1, panel C) during 2011\u20132013. All samples were taken by jugular vein puncture according to local laws, and serum samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until testing. All serum samples were shipped to the Erasmus MC laboratory in the Netherlands in agreement with Dutch import regulations.",

Results were expressed as relative mean fluorescent intensity (RFU) for each set of quadruplicate spots of antigen, with a cutoff of 4,000 RFU as used by Meyer et al. (6). Human CoV OC43 S1 was used as a proxy for bovine coronavirus (\u0392CoV), the latter of which is known to circulate commonly in dromedaries (7,12). High percentages of animals seropositive for MERS-CoV were observed in Nigeria and Ethiopia; the overall seropositivity was 94% in adult dromedaries in Nigeria and 93% and 97% for juvenile and adult animals, respectively, in Ethiopia (Table 1). All provinces in which dromedaries were sampled in both countries showed high rates of seropositivity (Figure 1). The overall seropositivity in dromedaries in Tunisia was 30% for animals \u22642 years of age and 54% for adult animals. Seropositivity of 36% and 40% was observed in Sidi Bouzid and Sousse Provinces, respectively, and 100% of the dromedaries in the southern province of Kebili were seropositive. Array results were confirmed on a selection of positive and negative serum samples (n = 14 per country) in MERS-CoV neutralization tests performed as described (2) (Table 2). Serum samples from 72%, 82%, and 67% of the dromedaries from Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tunisia, respectively, reacted with the OC43 antigen, confirming common circulation of \u0392CoV in camelids (7,12). All samples tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (data not shown).",

MERS-CoV genomic fragments have been detected in dromedaries in Qatar (10) and Saudi Arabia (9); near full-genome sequences have been generated from dromedaries in Egypt (5) and full-genome sequences have been generated from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia (13). Here, we show serologic evidence for circulation of MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV in dromedaries in countries in East, West, and North Africa, with possible herd-specific differences in prevalence in Tunisia. The lower seropositivity observed in herds raised for meat production in Tunisia might reflect a high turnover of camels with a continuous introduction of animals unexposed to the MERS-CoV into these herds. No camels imported from neighboring countries were found at the meat-producing farms in Sidi Bouzid and Sousse, only camels purchased from other farms in the same area or other areas in Tunisia. However, animals are frequently moved between Libya and Kebili for trade.",

The earliest serologic indication for circulation of MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV in dromedaries was observed in 1992; however, this result was based on results of a whole-virus ELISA with undescribed specificity (9). On the basis of well-validated array and neutralization tests, the study of dromedaries in the United Arab Emirates showed the presence of MERS-CoV or MERS-Cov-like antibodies as early as 2003 (6). The accumulated data on MERS-CoV serology in dromedaries (Figure 2; Table 1) show circulation of MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV in dromedaries in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula well before 2012, when the first cases in humans were identified, and show overall high levels of seropositivity, including in animals from countries without reported human cases.

In addition, for the whole region, the possibility exists that MERS-CoV illness occurred before its discovery in 2012 and that such infection has been overlooked in the areas with evidence for virus circulation among animals during the past 10 years. Retrospective studies of cohorts of humans with respiratory illnesses of unknown etiology should address this notion. ",
