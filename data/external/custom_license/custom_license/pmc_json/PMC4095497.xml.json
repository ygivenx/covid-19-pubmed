            "text": "Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Ontario Canada, the Canadian Resuscitation Institute was commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care to facilitate the improvement of inhospital emergency preparedness through a System-Level Training Initiative. Objectives for the program were to reduce mortality and improve efficiency of ICU resource use through early identification of patients at risk of deterioration and the provision of rapid resuscitation to abort avoidable ICU admissions. The program was designed to train nonphysician responders (primarily nurses and respiratory therapists) supported by remote physician oversight, especially in centres where ICU-trained physicians were not available.",

The 2-day course consisted of a series of small group, interactive, case-based seminars, high-fidelity simulation training, and the publication of a CCRT Provider Manual and Quick Reference Cards. A database for monitoring the effectiveness and impact of the CCRTs was also developed.",

Acquisition of equipment, liaisons with participating hospitals and creation of the CCRT database were completed in the spring of 2006. Since June 2006, 12 CCRT courses have been run, and 263 participants have been trained as CCRT Providers (87% nurses, and 13% respiratory therapists). Local hospital implementation and preceptored programs occurred over a 12-week period before CCRTs we made available full time (24/7).",
