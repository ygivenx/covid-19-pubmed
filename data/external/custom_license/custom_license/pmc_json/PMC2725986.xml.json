            "text": "To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HBoV, we investigated the presence of this virus in children with respiratory tract infection in our region (Gipuzkoa, Basque country, Spain). Among the first patients in whom HBoV was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates, we found two 12-month-old children with diarrhea in addition to respiratory symptoms. Because animal parvoviruses are frequently associated with enteritis in young animals (6), we investigated the presence of HBoV in the diarrheal feces of both children. HBoV was detected in both samples, and no other intestinal pathogens were identified. To rule out the possibility that this result could have been due to fecal contamination resulting from swallowing respiratory secretions, and to determine whether the gastrointestinal tract is affected by this new respiratory virus, we studied its presence in patient feces in 527 episodes of acute gastroenteritis, unrelated to respiratory infection, in children <3 years of age, mainly from nonhospital centers (ambulatory clinics). Our analysis were conducted from December 2005 through March 2006.",

Aliquots of the DNA and cDNA were frozen at \u221240\u00b0C until PCR for HBoV detection was performed. Respiratory samples were investigated for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, and adenovirus by cell culture and PCR. Rhinovirus, coronavirus (NL63 coronavirus included), and metapneumovirus were studied by PCR alone. Fecal specimens were examined for Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter spp., and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli O157 by standard culture methods. Rotavirus was investigated by enzyme immunoassay and norovirus by reverse transcriptase PCR. HBoV detection was performed by PCR with primers derived from the NP1 gene (1). Positive samples were retested and confirmed as positive by using a second PCR assay with primers derived from another location in the HBoV genome (VP1 gene) (7). Amplified NP1 and VP1 gene fragments (354 bp and 403 bp, respectively) were sequenced and analyzed by using the BLAST software (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Each PCR run included a negative control (water) that was treated as the clinical sample throughout, and PCR was performed with the usual precautions to avoid contamination. Strain Spain001 (GenBank accession no. EF186830) was included as positive control in each PCR run.",

Adenoviruses have been associated with infection of the colon and the gut and are a cause of severe gastroenteritis in nonindustrialized countries. In this study, coinfection of adenovirus and HBoV was detected in 1 respiratory specimen but these viruses together were not detected in any fecal sample.",

Further investigations to confirm this preliminary hypothesis and gain greater knowledge of the association between HBoV and enteric disease are required.",
