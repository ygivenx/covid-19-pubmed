In certain viruses evolution of a new variant may result in new manifestation of disease, change in host or tissue tropism or altered virulence. Emergence of drug-resistant microbes by natural selection confers an added advantage to them. The molecular evolution of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV, A226V mutation in glycoprotein envelope gene) leading to a higher efficiency of replication and dissemination in the vector species Aedes albopictus, is reported to have contributed to resurgence of Chikungunya fever (CHIK) in Kerala state in 2007 [8].",

In India, Japanese encephalitis was introduced where dams and canals were built to bring in water for rice cultivation. A large pig population is conducive for outbreaks of JE, while a large cattle population may support mosquito feeding, but act as dampeners for spread of JE, since viraemia is not present [7]. The worst affected districts in Kerala during the 2007 Chikungunya outbreak, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta, are hilly and heavily forested, with vast rubber plantations. The rainwater that collects in the hemispherical containers fitted to the trunks of rubber trees for latex collection in the region supported prolific breeding of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes contributing to resurgence of the disease [8].",

Several factors related to wild-life, like wild-life trade and translocation, live animal and bush-meat markets, consumption of exotic foods, ecotourism, access to petting zoos and ownership of exotic pets contribute to emergence of infectious diseases [11]. Outbreaks of Marburg and Ebola have been associated with transport of animals. The rapid economic growth in southern China leading to an increasing demand for animal proteins including those from exotic game food animals such as civets, and many varieties of these wild game mammals in overcrowded cages in wet markets allowed the jumping of the novel SARS coronavirus from animals to human [14]. Currently very few countries have active wild-life disease surveillance and it is the need of the hour to monitor the emergence of novel microbes.",

            "text": "Nipah virus, a zoonotic paramyxovirus, is an emerging virus endemic in Southeast Asia. Beginning in September 1998 a major outbreak of disease in pigs and human beings appeared in the northern part of peninsular Malaysia, resulting in 265 infected individuals and 105 deaths, most of whom were farmers or abattoir workers who had come in close contact with infected pigs [15]. Surprisingly, while respiratory symptoms predominated in pigs, infected humans presented mostly with encephalitic symptoms. In March 1999, a novel paramyxovirus was isolated from the CSF of an encephalitic patient from Sungai Nipah village. This virus which was later named as the Nipah virus was found to be closely related to Hendra virus, another paramyxovirus, identified in 1994, which caused severe respiratory illness in horses and humans in Australia [15\u201317]. These two geographically remote, yet phylogenetically close viruses were classified into a new genus-Henipavirus [18, 19]. Fruit bats belonging to the genus Pteropus were identified as the natural hosts for Nipah virus, while pigs were considered the intermediary hosts. The most likely explanation for introduction of the virus into pigs appears to be related to the practice of growing fruit orchards near piggeries to allow efficient use of pig waste as fertilizer for the trees. With some trees overhanging the pig-pens, it is likely that pigs were exposed to virus laden excreta and masticated fruit pellets dropped from feeding fruit bats also called as flying foxes, who are symptomless carriers of the virus [15]. Pigs infected with the virus showed less mortality; however, due to their predominant respiratory involvement, they spread the infection to humans in close contact.",

A similar outbreak which was retrospectively identified to be due to Nipah virus was reported in 2001 from Siliguri, West Bengal, not far from Bangladesh. All of the patients were residents of Siliguri and the outbreak occurred among hospitalized patients, family contacts of the patients, and medical staff of 4 hospitals. Sixty-six cases of encephalitis were identified, and the case-fatality ratio was 74%. Analysis of the limited sequence data suggested that the Nipah virus strains associated with the outbreak were more closely related to the virus isolated in Bangladesh than to the virus isolated in Malaysia, suggesting that viruses circulating in different areas have unique genetic signatures and may have co-evolved within local natural reservoirs [21].",

In Bangladesh, no intermediate animal host was identified and many infected individuals were thought to have had direct contact with fruits eaten by bats or consumed contaminated date palm sap [22]. In the Siliguri outbreak, studies to detect an intermediate host were not conducted. However, serological evidence suggested Pteropus giganteus fruit bats as reservoirs of infections in Bangladesh [23] as well as in India [24]. In both outbreaks, human-to-human transmission occurred in healthcare settings through contact with infected persons, supporting nosocomial mode of transmission. Initiating adequate barrier nursing techniques helped to curtail further spread of infection [21].",

The El Nino effect provoked heavy rainfall across the southern states in US, leading to proliferation of vegetation and consequently the rodent population, the natural hantavirus hosts which are asymptomatic carriers of the virus. As the population of rodents, especially deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) exploded and they sought food and shelter in human dwellings, people were exposed to the aerosolized animal droppings, urine and saliva, which lead to the infection [29]. The outbreak has continued since and by December 1, 2009, a total of 534 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with 36% mortality have been reported in the United States [30].",

Like all other enteroviruses, children are the most significant target as well as reservoir of EV-71. In a study of aetiology of viral encephalitis in children in Uttar Pradesh, the most common causative agent was EV-71, identified in 42% of the 87 patients enrolled in the study. Generalized convulsions with altered sensorium were a significant finding in these patients. The infection was associated with a significantly high morbidity and mortality; 50% of the children with EV-71 encephalitis died [57]. Nucleotide sequence analysis of an EV-71 isolate from a patient with acute flaccid paralysis (Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome) from Haryana, revealed that the Indian isolate is genetically distinct from the EV-71 strains isolated from other outbreaks in the Asia pacific region [56].",

Twenty-six suspected cases were investigated for the aetiological agent in another outbreak of encephalitis that affected children in tribal areas of Gujarat state in western India in 2004, with a case fatality rate of 78.3%. Demonstration of Chandipura viral RNA in 9 (45%) of 20 cases, IgM antibodies in 3 (15%), and isolation of the virus from one patient provided strong evidence for Chandipura virus as the aetiologic agent of the encephalitis outbreak. The virus sequences from the outbreak were closely related to prototype strain (1965) and isolates from the Andhra Pradesh, outbreak in 2003 [67]. Outbreaks of encephalitis due to Chandipura virus were reported in 2003 and 2005 from Maharashtra [68, 69] and in an hospital based surveillance of acute encephalitis among children from North Telangana in Andhra Pradesh [70]. Chandipura virus was confirmed as an aetiological agent of an acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) outbreak among children from Nagpur division in 2007, with a case fatality ratio of 43.6% [71].",

Buffalopox is an important emerging zoonosis affecting humans and in recent years several reports of infection in humans have been described from various states in India [89, 90]. Buffalopox virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus, and is closely related to Vaccinia virus. Human beings, including smallpox-vaccines contract infection upon close contact with infected animals, but the extent of disease is greater in non-immunized individuals. Milking of affected animals is one of the major modes of spread; human to human transmission has not been reported. Milkers develop pox-like lesions on the shin of their fingers, arms, fore-head and face associated with fever and axillary lymphadenitis. Regular monitoring of buffalopox outbreaks in India in animals and humans is essential to curb economic losses as well as to reduce public health impact of the disease [90].",

Despite extensive cross-reactivity among these viruses in serological tests, there is no cross protective immunity in humans; a person living in an endemic area can have as many as four infections, one with each serotype, during their life. The disease spectrum caused by Dengue virus varies from a subclinical infection to a mild self limiting disease-dengue fever (DF) and a severe disease that may be fatal, the dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). The Dengue viruses are the only known arboviruses that have fully adapted to humans, having lost the need for an enzootic cycle for maintenance. Usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the virus has been reported to be transmitted in recent years by Aedes albopictus, which may have significance with respect to dengue re-emergence [91].",

However, in recent years, dengue which has been an urban disease has spread to rural areas of India as well [92, 93]. Dengue and the vector have been reported in the arid zones of Rajasthan [94, 95]. The disease has changed its course manifesting in the severe form as DHF and with increasing frequency of outbreaks, with all four Dengue serotypes co-circulating and the predominant serotypes ever changing [96\u201398]. These severe complications are thought to occur as a result of evolution of the Dengue virus to escape high population immunity manifesting as increased viral virulence and human immunopathogenesis due to antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection [99]. The resurgence of Dengue can be linked to urbanization and unprecedented population growth, increased density of the mosquito vector, reinfestation with Aedes aegypti of a new geographical area, warm and humid climate, water storage pattern in houses, storage of junk in open spaces, including tyres, coconut shells etc. that trap rain water, introduction of new serotype of the virus, lack of effective mosquito control and to the enormous increase in the international transport of people and commodities [100, 101]. Since vaccines or antiviral drugs are not available for Dengue viruses, the only effective way to prevent epidemic DF/DHF is to control the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti and prevent its bite [101].",

Subsequently, outbreaks were reported in Assam, Karnataka and Pondicherry, and Uttar Pradesh in the 1980s [102]. In recent years, JEV has spread to new geographical locations within India-into Haryana and Kerala states in northwestern and southwestern India, respectively [103, 104]. A new focus of infection in Sangli district of Maharashtra was reported in 1999. Since 2000, JE occurrence has been reported from 16 States and Union Territories and among them Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Karnataka have accounted for more than 90% of the total incidence in India [102]. In 2005, Uttar Pradesh faced a devastating epidemic outbreak of JE, which surpassed in intensity and magnitude, all previous reported epidemic outbreaks in the country. The outbreak was mostly confined to Gorakhpur affecting 6,061 cases with 1,500 deaths followed by another outbreak in 2006 with 2,320 cases and 528 deaths [105].",

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched an Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 2004 to connect all district hospitals and state-run medical colleges to facilitate tele-education, training of health professionals and monitoring of disease trends. The project is implemented through the Central Surveillance Unit within the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) at New Delhi and aims to detect early warning signals of impending disease outbreaks and initiate effective and rapid health actions with the help of information and communication technology at the district, state and national levels. In addition to monitoring diseases like vector borne infections, diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory diseases, and vaccine preventable diseases, the IDSP also has a category called \u2018unusual clinical syndromes,\u2019 which would alert public health professionals to an intentional release of any biological-agent [114].",

Some laboratories geared their capacity by training manpower to carry out confirmation of index cases and test large number of samples. This activity may have helped build capacity of several state level laboratories to tackle similar emergencies, though, lessons learnt from managing one outbreak may not always suffice for another, as the agent, mode of transmission and susceptible population may differ. Two main factors for containment of an outbreak are isolation and contact tracing [115]. There is a need to move from conventional time consuming laboratory techniques to molecular technologies with rapid and sensitive detection capabilities and increased throughput for responding to the threats posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses in the recent past [115, 116]. There is also a need to create awareness among clinical microbiologists/virologists about existing outbreak reporting systems, laboratories designated for handling and processing samples for outbreak management, and for training and development of skills for testing and identifying new and emerging pathogens [115].",
