These double-stranded RNA\nmolecules are typically 19 to 23 nucleotides in length, and\nconsequently have a molecular weight of approximately 13 to\n15 kd and 38 to 46 negative charges. As a consequence, passive\ntransport over the lipophilic cell membrane is poor [3\u20135].\nAt the same time, intracellular entry and translocation into the\ncytoplasm (and/or nucleus), where the RNAi machinery is located,\nis a prerequisite, for gene silencing activity [6\u20139].\nMore importantly, for in vivo applications, intracellular entry\ninto the target cell within the diseased tissue is required and\nshould lead to appearance in the cytoplasm to silence the mRNA of\ninterest (Figure 1). Ideally, siRNA should therefore\nbe targeted to three levels: to the target tissue, the target cell\ntype, and the subcellular compartment.",

The\nobservations have been attributed to translocation of siRNA over the cell membrane by a dsRNA-receptor, referred to in Caenorhabditis elegans as\nSID-1,which is responsible in this organism for systemic\nspreading of the silencing effects [11]. Indeed,\noverexpression of the mammalian homologue increases the\nintracellular uptake of siRNA [12]. In contrast, \u201cnaked\u201d\nsiRNA is used by many researchers as a negative control which\nfails to produce silencing effects after injection in vivo and\neven after prolonged incubation of cells with high siRNA\nconcentrations in vitro. This lack of activity of \u201cnaked\u201d siRNA\nindicates that not all cell types express (enough of) the SID-1\nhomologue, to observe silencing effects. In addition, the rapid\nremoval of \u201cnaked\u201d siRNA after intravenous administration from\nthe circulation, with more than 99% of the injected dose\nrenally excreted and taken up by liver Kupffer cells within\nminutes, makes a very small percentage of the administered dose\navailable for the target tissue. This small percentage is\nadditionally subject to nuclease degradation. Therefore,\nintravenous injection of naked siRNA relying on passive targeting\nof the diseased tissue, and SID-1 homologue-mediated target cell\nuptake seem to be inefficient and as yet unpredictable.",

Initial studies centered on\nthe tolerance of the RNAi system for modifications in the two RNA strands\n[29]. A number of chemical modifications have been proposed to increase nuclease resistance, like boranophosphates\n[30], 4\u2032-thioribonucleosides, phosphorothioates,\n2\u2032deoxy-2\u2032 fluorouridine, 2\u2032-O-methyl, 2\u2032-O-(2-methoxyethyl), and locked\nnucleotides\n[31\u201336]. All of these chemically modified siRNAs were still able\nto induce siRNA-mediating gene silencing provided that the modifications\nwere absent in specific regions of the siRNA and included to a limited\nextent. These specific restrictions regarding position and degree of\nmodifications were dependent on the characteristics of the incorporated\nmodification. Although increased nuclease resistance of siRNA would be\nexpected to increase in vivo silencing effects, Layzer et al showed that\nthis is not necessarily the case. They studied silencing effects in the\nliver after hydrodynamic injection, and showed that unmodified siRNA had a\nsimilar potency as the stabilized version [36].",

They have developed siRNAs with partial\nphosphorothioate backbone modifications and 2\u2032-O-methyl sugar\nvariations on the sense and antisense strands to promote nuclease\nresistance, while at the same time cholesterol was conjugated to\nthe 3\u2032 end of the sense strand using a pyrrolidine linker to\nchange tissue distribution. The cholesterol-modified siRNA\nsilenced reporter gene expression in vitro in the absence of\ntransfection agents, something not observed for unmodified siRNAs.\nProbably the interaction of the cholesterol with serum components\nin the culture medium improved siRNA translocation over the\ncellular membrane. The cholesterol modification particularly\nenhanced binding of siRNA to serum albumin, probably explaining\nthe prolonged circulation half-life measured after intravenous\ninjection as compared to unmodified siRNA. In addition to a\nprolonged presence in the circulation, cholesterol-modified siRNAs\nwere detected in liver and jejunum at concentrations of\n100\u2013200 ng per gram tissue 24 hours after the last injection\nof 50 mg/kg doses. These levels were sufficient to reduce the\nlevels of the apolipoprotein apoB-100 in plasma by 31\u201368%.\nThis reduction was paralleled by a 37% reduction in overall\ncholesterol levels, and reduction in high-density lipoprotein,\nlow- density lipoprotein, and chylomicron levels. Despite these\nimpressive results using relatively simple modifications, the\ndoses of chemically modified siRNAs needed are relatively high and\nseem to underline that changing tissue distribution of siRNA in\nfavor of target cell uptake by conjugation with comparatively\nsmall chemical groups is difficult to achieve. At the same time,\nsmall molecular weight modifications seem to be needed to preserve\ncorrect interaction with the RNAi enzymes. Cleavable linkers for\ncoupling of bulkier modifications may be an approach to avoid\nthese problems. In conclusion, chemical modifications do promise\nimportant advances regarding nuclease resistance and reduced\ninduction of the stress response. Invitrogen has developed a\nsecond-generation siRNA, known as Stealth RNAi, in which chemical\nmodifications are designed to increase the specificity of RNAi\neffects by allowing only the antisense strand to efficiently enter\nthe RNAi pathway and eliminating induction of interferon-related\npathways. Others have also demonstrated that sequence and\nmodifications can strongly influence intensity of silencing\nefficiency and inflammatory reactions, providing tools to optimize\nthese [41, 42].",

            "text": "Over the last decades, research on the promises of nucleic acids\nfor therapeutic intervention and the difficulties encountered in\nturning these promises into clinical reality has provided a\nclearer picture of the development steps that are needed to\ntransform nucleic acids into actual drug molecules. As a result \nsiRNA has been able to make a remarkable rapid\nprogress from initial discovery as functional mediator of RNA\ninterference in mammalian cells in 2001 to three\nclinical trials at the end of 2005: two in age-related macular\ndegeneration, the other in respiratory syncytial virus infection\n[71]. Nevertheless, the \nchoice of the diseases also reflects the delivery difficulties encountered \nfor this class of nucleic acids. These diseases were selected partly because the target cell\ndelivery problems are relatively low as these pathologies are\nconfined to specific and accessible sites. To further improve\ntarget specificity, also in view of possible adverse effects\noccurring when siRNA is processed by nontarget cells, and to allow\napplication of siRNA for systemic treatment several strategies can\nbe proposed (Figure 2). Taken together they serve to\nincrease nuclease resistance, to reduce renal\nexcretion/specific cell uptake, to promote uptake by the\ntarget cells, and to ensure correct intracellular trafficking to\nthe site of action. As the first preclinical proofs of principle\nhave been delivered showing therapeutic effects of locally and\nsystemically delivered siRNAs, it is expected that these\nstrategies will soon translate into viable clinical development\nprograms.",
