MBL binds to carbohydrates on the surface of a number of respiratory pathogens that are associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including Haemophilus influenzae,10,11Mycoplasma pneumoniae,12 and influenza.13 Patients with cystic fibrosis and low MBL concentrations have decreased lung function, an increased prevalence of Burkholderia cepacia infection, and reduced survival relative to patients with cystic fibrosis and normal MBL concentrations. The difference in survival is particularly notable in those with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and those with homozygous mutations in the MBL-2 gene.14\u201317 Low MBL concentrations have been associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections in immunocompetent subjects,18\u201321 with an increased frequency of respiratory syncytial virus infections,22 and with worse outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections.23\u201326 MBL concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from a small number of current and former smokers with COPD are lower than those in fluid from healthy controls and tend to be higher in former smokers than in current smokers,27,28 but no association has been found between genotypes producing low MBL concentrations and the prevalence of COPD.29 However, studies assessing the association of low MBL concentrations with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) report conflicting results.30\u201332 Accordingly, we prospectively measured MBL concentrations in a large cohort of subjects with COPD who were at increased risk of experiencing acute exacerbations and followed them for one year while tracking the number of acute exacerbations that occurred. Our hypothesis was that subjects with COPD who had an increased risk of experiencing an AECOPD would have more frequent acute exacerbations during one year of follow-up if they were deficient in MBL than if they were not.",

Accordingly, our data do not support the idea that MBL might be a therapeutic target to reduce the incidence of AECOPDs.
