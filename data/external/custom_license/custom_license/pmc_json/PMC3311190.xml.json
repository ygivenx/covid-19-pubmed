By rescreening the samples (collection A) with a RT-qPCR, AstV RNA was detected in 43.49% (10/23) of the samples tested. The mean titer in the AstV-positive samples from collection A was 4.3 \u00d7 106 GE/\u03bcL RNA extract, corresponding to \u22481.5 \u00d7 109 GE/mL feces. Notably, by EM observation, none of the AstV-positive samples was clearly found to contain SRV-like particles (Table 1). Immune EM that uses specific hyperimmune or convalescent-phase serum specimens could be necessary to improve the sensitivity of the EM technique. Also enzyme- or pH-mediated alterations in virus morphologic features could be triggered during conservation of samples and therefore hamper recognition of these SRVs. Overall, rabbit AstVs can be assumed to be easily undetected in EM-based surveys, thus leading to underestimation of the potential role of SRVs in rabbit EC/REC syndrome.",

However, the differences observed in rabbit AstV prevalence, and titers between the 2 sample collections are not necessarily suggestive of a pathogenic attitude or role for rabbit AstVs and must be interpreted with caution.

Similar ranges of genetic diversity/heterogeneity in this portion of AstV genome (ORF2) have been observed in other AstVs found in mammals (36). Notably, the 5\u2032 end of ORF2 appeared to be more conserved than the central region and the 3\u2032 end. AstVs contain a conserved region at the junction between ORF1b and ORF2 (26). The exact role of this sequence is not known, but it may be a regulatory element of the subgenomic RNA that encodes for ORF2. This region appeared nearly completely conserved in the sequence of strain Nausika/08/ITA. Unlike the situation with other mammalian AstVs, but not unusually, the highly conserved motif SRGHAE at the C-terminus of the capsid protein (27) was not found. In addition, the stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) at the 3\u2032 end of the genome in the 3\u2032 nontranslated region (28) was not present in strain Nausika/08/ITA. This motif is present in most AstVs, with the exception of turkey AstV 2, human AstV MLB1, and rat AstV (36,37). This motif is also found in some coronaviruses and equine rhinovirus serotype 2. The conservation of such a sequence motif across multiple viral families suggests that it may play a broad role in the biology of positive-stranded RNA viruses (28), although the exact function of this conserved region is still unknown.",
