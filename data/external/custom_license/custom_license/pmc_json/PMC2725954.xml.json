Numbers of patients admitted for respiratory infectious disease during this period are shown in the Figure. Cases diagnosed as pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and influenza were classified as respiratory infectious diseases. Although records of patients with tuberculosis were found, we excluded them from this study. In the 10-month period from January to October, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) monthly numbers of patients with pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and influenza were 10.9 \u00b1 6.5, 10.0 \u00b1 3.6, and 1.8 \u00b1 4.1, respectively (22.7 \u00b1 9.6 for all 3 illnesses). Death rates from pneumonia, bronchitis, and influenza during this period were 3.4% (4/116), 0% (0/109), and 0% (0/18), respectively. The number of influenza patients suddenly increased to 109 in November, and 9 of them died (8%). Because our information about these 109 patients was found only in the hospitalization registries (the patients\u2019 medical records were not found), we could not identify their clinical symptoms. However, it can be assumed that the hospital experienced the first wave of Spanish influenza in November 1918. Because no hospitalization registry before this period was found, comparison with outbreaks in average years was not possible.",

All 132 cases were in infantrymen 19\u201349 years of age (mean \u00b1 standard deviation 22.7 \u00b1 4.1 years); 47% had been farmers before entering the military, and 72% had no recorded medical histories. The initial symptom was sudden fever in 116 patients (94%), headache in 101 (81%), chills in 92 (74%), cough in 86 (69%), general malaise in 60 (48%), appetite loss in 56 (45%), pharyngalgia in 45 (36%), arthralgia/myalgia in 33 (27%), and vomiting/diarrhea in 27 (22%). On admission, reddish pharynx was noted in 105 (85%), coated tongue in 95 (77%), thoracic rale in 71 (57%), facial flush in 24 (19%), and conjunctival congestion in 16 (13%). The period from onset to admission was 4.7 \u00b1 3.9 days (range 0\u201324 days), the duration of hospitalization was 14.8 \u00b1 12.0 days (range 3\u201379 days), and the death rate was 6.0% (8/132). A comparison of 124 patients who survived and 8 who died is shown in the Table. In the fatal cases, body temperature and pulse rate were higher at the time of hospital admission, and thoracic rale and an \u201cagonized facial expression\u201d (a painful expression as reported by Japanese doctors) were observed in many patients. The death rate was higher in patients who had digestive symptoms, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Initial symptoms were fever, headache, chills, and cough, and their frequency was not different from those of patients with seasonal or ordinary influenza. When cases in patients who survived were compared with those in patients who died (Table), high fever, tachycardia, thoracic rale, and an \u201cagonized facial expression\u201d were associated with poor outcomes. All treatments were antisymptomatic supportive therapy, and none of the drugs used was typical of modern medical care. Thus, most cases may not have been affected by treatments.

The former Japanese Ministry of the Interior reported that the mean death rate from Spanish influenza in Japan was 1.21%\u20135.29% (11), but the death rate for our study patients was higher. The death rate from influenza is high for patients \u226565 years of age, but the death rate from Spanish influenza was also reported to be high for persons 20\u201330 years of age (14,15). The mean age of the population investigated was 22.7 years. Persons 20\u201330 years of age had the highest death rate and this may have been the reason for the overall higher death rate. The cause of a high death rate in young persons is unclear, but it may have been related to poor immunity because they had not previously been exposed to influenza virus. It may have also been related to poor conditions in military field hospitals at the end of World War I. Poor conditions in military field hospitals in foreign countries have also been reported (16,17).",
