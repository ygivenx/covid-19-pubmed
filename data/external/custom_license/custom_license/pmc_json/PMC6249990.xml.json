As a result, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (see Glossary) has been championed as the obvious and inevitable future of diagnostics in multiple reviews and opinion pieces dating back to 2010 1, 2, 3, 4. Despite enthusiasm in the community, WGS diagnostics has not yet been widely adopted in clinical microbiology, which may seem at odds with the current suite of applications for which WGS has huge potential, and which are already widely used in the academic literature. Common applications of WGS in diagnostic microbiology include isolate characterization, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling, and establishing the sources of recurrent infections and between-patient transmissions. All of these have obvious clinical relevance and provide case studies where WGS could, in principle, provide additional information and even replace the knowledge obtained through standard clinical microbiology techniques. This review reiterates the potential of WGS for clinical microbiology, but also its current limitations, and suggests possible solutions to some of the main bottlenecks to routine implementation. In particular, we argue that applying existing WGS pipelines developed for fundamental research is unlikely to produce the fast and robust tools required, and that new dedicated approaches are needed for WGS in the clinic.",

WGS-based strain identification gives a far superior resolution compared to genetic marker-based approaches such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and can be used when standard techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) profiling, and MALDI-TOF are unable to accurately distinguish lineages [5]. WGS-informed strain identification could be of particular significance for bacteria with large accessory genomes, which encompass many of the clinically most problematic bacteria, where much of the relevant genetic diversity is driven by differences in the accessory genome on the chromosome and/or plasmid carriage.",

Clinical microbiology tends to rely on often largely ad hoc taxonomical nomenclature, such as biochemical serovars for Salmonella enterica or mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While the rich information contained in WGS should in principle allow superseding traditional taxonomic classifications 6, 7, defining an intuitive, meaningful and rigorous classification for genome sequences represents a major challenge. For strictly clonal species, which undergo no horizontal gene transfer (HGT), such as M. tuberculosis, it is possible to devise a \u2018natural\u2019 robust phylogenetically based classification [8]. Unfortunately, organisms undergoing regular HGT, and with a significant accessory genome, do not fall neatly into existing classification schemes. In fact, it is even questionable whether a completely satisfactory classification scheme could be devised for such organisms, as classifications based on the core genome, accessory genome, housekeeping genes (MLST), genotypic markers, plasmid sequence, virulence factors or AMR profile may all produce incompatible categories (Figure 1).",

Sequence-based drug profiling is one of the pillars of HIV treatment and has to be credited for the remarkable success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimes. Prediction of AMR from sequence data has also received considerable attention for bacterial pathogens but has not led to comparable success at this stage.",

In principle, WGS offers the possibility to predict the full resistance profile to multiple drugs (the \u2018resistome\u2019). Possibly the first real attempt to predict the resistome from WGS data was a study by Holden et al. in 2013, showing that, for a large dataset of S. aureus ST22 isolates, 98.8% of all phenotypic resistances could be explained by at least one previously documented AMR element or mutation in the sequence data [9].",

Of these, ResFinder and CARD can be implemented as online methods that, dependent on user traffic, can be considerably slower than most other tools that only use the command-line. They are, however, superior in terms of broad usability and are more intuitive than, for example, the graphical user interface of SSTAR. Other tools exist for richer species-specific characterization such as PhyResSE [13] and PATRIC-RAST [14].

The level of resistance of a strain to a drug can be affected by multiple epistatic AMR elements or mutations [25], the copy number variation of these elements [26], the function of the genetic background of the strain 27, 28, 29, and modulating effects by the environment [30]. The level of resistance is generally well captured by the semiquantitative phenotypic measurement minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), even if clinicians often use a discrete interpretation of MICs into resistant/susceptible based on fairly arbitrary cut-off values. Quantitative resistance predictions are not just of academic interest. In the clinic, low-level resistance strains can still be treated with a given antibiotic but the standard dose should be increased, which can be the best option at hand, especially for drugs with low toxicity.",

Yet, some tools have also been developed for multispecies virulence profiling: the Virulence Factors Database (VFDB) [31] or VirulenceFinder [32] as well as the bespoke virulence prediction tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kleborate [33]. One major challenge is that virulence is often a context-dependent trait. For example, in K. pneumoniae various imperfect proxies for virulence are used. These include capsule type, hypermucovisity, biofilm and siderophore production, or survival in serum-killing assays. While all of these traits are quantifiable and reproducible, and could thus in principle be predicted using WGS, it remains unclear how well they correlate with virulence in the patient. Given that virulence is one of the most commonly studied phenotypes, yet lacks a clear definition, the general problem of predicting bacterial phenotype from genotype may be substantially more complex than the special case of AMR, which is itself far from solved for all clinically relevant species.",

Approaches based on transmission chains can also be used to identify sources of recurrent infections (so called \u2018super-spreaders\u2019), and do not necessarily rely on all isolates within the outbreak having been sequenced, allowing for partial sampling and analyses of ongoing outbreaks [48].

Unfortunately, in some cases insufficient genetic variation will have accumulated over the course of an outbreak, and a transmission chain simply cannot be inferred without this signal 57, 58.

WGSA allows the upload of genome assemblies through a drag-and-drop web browser, allowing for a quick characterization of species, MLST type, resistance profile, and phylogenetic placement in the context of the existing species database based on core genes. At the time of writing WGSA comprises 20 649 genomes predominantly from S. aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, together with Ebola and Zika viruses, all with some associated metadata.",

While sequence data from academic publications is near systematically deposited on public sequence databases (at least upon publication), such data are near useless if the accompanying metadata (see above) are not also released, as remains the case far too often.

It is commonly accepted that sequencing costs are plummeting with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) estimating the cost per raw megabase (Mb) of DNA sequence to 0.12 USD (www.genome.gov/sequencingcostsdata). This has led to claims that a draft bacterial genome can currently cost less than 1 USD to generate [62]. This is a misunderstanding as one cannot simply extrapolate the cost of a bacterial genome by multiplying a high-throughput per DNA megabase (Mb) sequencing cost by the size of its genome. For microbial sequencing, multiple samples must be multiplexed for cost efficiency, which is easier to achieve in large reference laboratories with high sample turnover. Excluding indirect costs such as salaries for personnel, preparation of sequencing libraries now makes up the major fraction of microbial sequencing costs (Figure 2).",

Realistic cost estimates for a microbial genome including library preparation on the best available platforms give a different picture (Figure 2B). Since the introduction of the Illumina MiSeq platform in 2011, new sequencing kits generating higher output have only marginally affected true microbial genome sequencing costs, as library preparation makes up a significant portion of the total (60 USD of a total of 74 USD for a typical bacterial genome in 2018). These costs have remained stable over time and are unlikely to go down significantly in the near future.

In this scenario, WGS is used as an adjunct technology primarily to provide information on the presence of AMR and virulence genes, which is particularly useful for mechanisms that are difficult to determine phenotypically (e.g. carbapenem resistance). This use of WGS, whilst solving some of the current clinical problems, does not speed up the diagnosis of infection; it is more the case that new technology is replacing some of the more cumbersome laboratory techniques whilst providing additional information.",

            "text": "WGS is more appealing as a microbiological fast diagnostics solution when combined with procedures that circumvent (or shorten) the traditional culture step. This can be achieved through direct sampling of clinical material (Box 1) or by using a protocol enriching for sequences of specific organism(s). Such enrichment methods, generally based on the capture of known sequences though hybridization, are a particularly tractable approach for viruses due to their small genome size. For example, the VirCap virome capture method targets all known viruses and can even enrich for novel sequences [64]. Similar methods targeting specific organisms have been developed and successfully deployed, representing an attractive option for unculturable organisms 16, 65, 66, 67, 68.Box 1WGS beyond Single GenomesWGS in the strict sense usually refers to sequencing the genome of a single organism, and it is common to distinguish between the sample (the material that has actually been taken from the patient) and the isolate (an organism that has been cultured and isolated from that sample). WGS methods traditionally sequence a cultured isolate to reduce contamination from other organisms, or sometimes rely on enrichment strategies targeting sequences from a specific organism 66, 67. However, this represents only a small fraction of the total microbial diversity present in a clinical sample.In contrast, metagenomic approaches sequence samples in an untargeted way. This approach is particularly relevant for clinical scenarios where the pathogen of interest cannot be predicted and/or is fastidious (i.e., has complex culturing requirements). Example applications of clinical metagenomics include: when the disease causing agent is unexpected 74, 75; investigating the spread of AMR-carrying plasmids across species [35]; and characterizing the natural history of the microbiome [76]. The removal of the culture requirement can drastically decrease turn-around time from sample to data and enable identification of both rare and novel pathogens. Different samples however present different challenges. Easy-to-collect sample sites (e.g., faeces and sputum) typically also have a resident microbiota, so it can be challenging to distinguish the etiological agent of disease from colonizing microbes. Conversely, sites that are usually sterile (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid) present a much better opportunity for metagenomics to contribute to clinical care.Metagenomic data are more complex to analyze than single species WGS data and tend to rely on sophisticated computational tools, such as the Desman software allowing inference of strain-level variation in a metagenomic sample [77]. Such approaches can be difficult to implement, are computationally very demanding, and are unlikely to be deployable in clinical microbiology in the near future, although cloud-based platforms may circumvent the need for computational resources in diagnostic laboratories. Furthermore, some faster approaches for rapid strain characterization from raw sequence reads, such as MASH [78] and KmerFinder 10, 79, could find a use in diagnostics microbiology, with the latter having been shown to identify the presence of pathogenic strains even in culture-negative samples [10].However, the differences between these methods should not obscure their fundamental similarities. Obtaining single-species genomes from culture is one end of a continuum of methods that stretches all the way to full-blown metagenomics of a sample. In principle, all methods produce the same kind of data: strings of bases. Furthermore, in all cases what is clinically relevant represents only a small fraction of these data. Integrating sequencing data from different methods into a single diagnostics pipeline is therefore an attractive prospect to quickly identify the genomic needles in the metagenomic haystack in a species-agnostic manner. For example, the presence of a particular antibiotic-resistance gene in sequencing data may recommend against the use of that antibiotic; whether the gene is present in data from a single-species isolate or from metagenomes is irrelevant. As an example, Leggett et al. used MinION metagenomic profiling to identify pathogen-specific AMR genes present in a faecal sample from a critically ill infant all within 5 h of taking the initial sample [80].Alt-text: Box 1",

In particular, levels of human DNA are significantly higher in faecal samples from hospitalized patients compared to healthy controls [71], suggesting that the problem is exacerbated in clinical settings. Therefore, the ethical and legal issues raised by introducing human WGS into routine healthcare [72] cannot be avoided by microbially focused clinical metagenomics. Dismissing these concerns as minor may be an option for academic researchers uninterested in these human data, but it is naive to think that hospital ethics committees will share this view. Even in the absence of human DNA, metagenomic samples from multiple body sites can be used to identify individuals in datasets of hundreds of people [73].

However, how these analyses are implemented varies widely, both between microbial species and human labs. Despite some commercial attempts at one-stop analysis suites such as Ridom Seqsphere+ (http://www.ridom.com/seqsphere/), most laboratories use a collection of open-source tools to perform particular subanalyses. Typically, these tools are then woven together into a patchwork of software (a \u2018pipeline\u2019). The idea of a pipeline is to allow within-laboratory standardized analysis of batches of isolates with relatively little manual bioinformatics work. Such pipelines can be highly customizable for a wide range of questions. There are also some communal efforts at streamlining workflows across laboratories. As an example, Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org) is a framework that allows nonbioinformaticians to use a wide array of bioinformatics tools through a web interface.",

For example, at the time of writing (May, 2018), the \u2018QC and manipulation\u2019 step in Galaxy alone consists of 35 different tools, tests, and workflows that can be applied to an input sequence. While this is desirable from a researcher\u2019s perspective, it is clearly prohibitive for real-time analysis in a clinical setting. A user requires in-depth knowledge about the purpose each tool serves, the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and a functional understanding of the important parameters. Furthermore, most analysis pipelines require proficiency in Linux systems and navigating the command line, something clinical microbiologists are rarely trained for.",

In order to move towards real-time interpretable results for clinics it will be necessary to take certain shortcuts. The focus should be on rapid, automated analysis and clear, unambiguous results. Some steps in the pipeline can simply be omitted for clinical purposes. As an example, genome assembly might appear to be a bottleneck for real-time WGS diagnostics, but is probably rarely required; sufficient characterization of an isolate can be made by analysis of the k-mers in the raw sequence data, which is orders of magnitude faster. Accurate identification of an isolate can be made rapidly with MinHash-based k-mer matching methods such as Mash [78], and AMR elements can be identified from k-mers alone [14]. Another example of a computationally intensive step that could be omitted from a default pipeline is sophisticated phylogenetic inference. Best practice for the creation of phylogenetic trees may involve evaluating the individual likelihood of a very wide range of possible trees given a sequence alignment or other distance metric, repeated for thousands of bootstrapped replicates, giving a tree with high confidence but with extreme computational time costs. A clinical pipeline could use much faster approaches and still provide an informative phylogenetic tree [82].",

This matrix could be used to generate a phylogenetic tree using a computationally inexpensive method (e.g., neighbor-joining). Additionally, a correlation between pairwise genetic distance and sampling date could be performed to test for evidence of temporal signal in the data (i.e., accumulation of a sufficient number of mutations over the sampling period).
