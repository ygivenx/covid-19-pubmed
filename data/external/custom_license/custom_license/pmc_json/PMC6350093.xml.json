The length of these measurements, or equivalently, the interval between records, is the period of measurement [1]. Although time-series predictions have been widely used in public health surveillance, a body of literature in statistics presents methods by which autocorrelation can detect the best periodicity. Periodicity detection refers to the detection of periodic patterns in a time-series database [2] and can improve the performance of time-series prediction [3-5]. Autocorrelation is a measure of the internal correlation within a time series [4] and a way of measuring and explaining internal association between observations in a time series. The autocorrelation sequence of a periodic time series has the same cyclic characteristics as the time series itself. Thus, autocorrelation can help verify the presence of cycles and determine their durations [3]. Autocorrelation is often used to identify the best periodicity for time-series analysis [3-5]. This method selects the periodicity in which the autocorrelation is maximized, which would provide time series with better prediction performance [5]. The main aim of this study was to establish a period of measurement in which the autocorrelation is maximized and the periodicity is the interval that its prediction outperforms.",

            "text": "The selection of the period of measurement determines the interval for prediction. Thus, from the operational perspective, for the prediction to be meaningful and valuable in public health surveillance, there has to be a limit to its length. For example, when predicting influenza A cases for the next year, although the 8-week period of measurement may generate the best performance for the prediction, it also produces predicted values that are aggregated 8 weeks at a time. This period is too long to provide any value for practitioners. The 8-week period would cover most of the winter, which is expected to have more influenza A cases even if there is no prediction. For many diseases, particularly infectious diseases that are not disruptive to the healthcare infrastructure (eg, influenza), a 1-week prediction window is generally sufficient. However, for the healthcare infrastructure, a greater prediction window would be helpful to allow planning for potential changes, staffing, or resource allocation. Ultimately, identification of the optimal prediction window allows users to decide what is acceptable for their role in the community.",

Although autocorrelation provides the best period of measurement, this period may be too long to be practically acceptable. Therefore, we adopted a change-point analysis (CPA) to detect a shorter period of prediction with no change point in between in order to achieve similar performance with a shorter period. To this end, our method aims to apply CPA for autocorrelations of different periods of measurement. The objective is to identify the shortest period of measurement that has an autocorrelation value similar to the maximum value of autocorrelations.",

Data have been used for further resource planning and initiating warning systems [6,7]; for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention organized a challenge to predict the 2013-2014 United States influenza season [8]. The ability to accurately forecast various diseases could facilitate key preparedness actions such as the development and use of medical countermeasures, communication strategies, and healthcare resource management [9]. To achieve this goal, different statistical methods have been used to forecast disease counts; time-series prediction is a method often used in relevant literature [1,10-12], wherein the analysis predicts disease counts by modelling historical surveillance data [1,13]. However, the literature in this area recommends the use of a wide range of methods such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [14] and structural equation modelling [15].",

Therefore, the literature in this field has suggested autocorrelation as one of the most commonly used algorithms to identify the best period of measurement in time series [5]. Autocorrelation refers to the correlation of a time series with its own past and future values [3]. The main objective of this method is to obtain an autocorrelation sequence of a periodic signal with the same cyclic characteristics as the signal itself, allowing autocorrelation to verify the presence of cycles and determine their durations [4].

In this study, we used the pruned exact linear time (PELT) CPA method suggested by Killick et al (2012) [42]. This method is based on the CPA method of Jackson et al (2005) [43], but incorporates a pruning step that reduces the computational cost of the method and does not affect the exactness of the resulting segmentation. Although many CPA methods that can only detect the most significant change point, PELT can identify multiple change points. Therefore, owing to its computational performance, this study adopted the PELT method [44]. In addition, we used the R package for CPA [45], which implements PELT. In this algorithm, a change point is defined as the point that characterizes changing trends.

Therefore, we used CPA to find the shortest period of measurement, which has similar performance as the period identified by AC.",

Our method implements a practical perspective through which we aim to determine the shortest period of measurement that achieves a better prediction performance. This finding makes the method practically applicable in the field when longer periods of prediction, even with better performance, are not operationally valuable to public health professionals. Our method was evaluated against ANN and ARIMA analyses for disease counts of chlamydia, salmonella, RSV, gonorrhea, viral meningitis, and influenza A between 2007 and 2017 in Northern Nevada. Future work should focus on enhancing the evaluation of the method by using more diverse datasets as well as assessing the use of Fourier Transforms instead of AC. Moreover, we encourage researchers to use a wide range of machine learning and alternative CPA methods to improve the suggested approach.",
