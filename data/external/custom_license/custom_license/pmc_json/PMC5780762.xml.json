Globally, the frequency of HBoV\u20101 co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses amongst children with lower respiratory tract infection is reported to be as high as 83%.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n44\n Furthermore, it has been reported that HBoV co\u2010infection may be higher amongst hospitalised individuals compared with those with mild illness as shedding is potentially enhanced by airway inflammation resulting from co\u2010infection with an additional respiratory pathogen, or that HBoV may play a role in enhancing or aggravating symptoms of existing infections.\n5\n Mechanisms proposed to explain the high rate of co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses include that HBoV is either a helper virus, facilitating replication of other respiratory pathogens or that HBoV may require a helper virus to facilitate productive infection.\n45\n It must also be considered that the more recent widespread use of highly sensitive multiplex assays enabling simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single patient sample may also contribute to the high rate of co\u2010infection with HBoV and additional respiratory pathogens detected. In this study, 44% of patients were co\u2010infected with HBoV and an additional respiratory virus. Regionally, the reported rate of HBoV co\u2010infections varies and does not appear to be particularly associated with hospitalisation: 42% amongst hospitalized children in Singapore,\n32\n 90% amongst out\u2010patient children aged <5 years in rural Thailand,\n37\n 9% amongst hospitalised children in Vietnam.\n31\n In this study, co\u2010infection with HBoV and HRhV was most frequently detected (Table 3), analogous to the findings of a similar study conducted amongst paediatric patients in rural Thailand.\n37\n Whether the high frequency of HBoV and HRhV co\u2010infection is a reflection of the high incidence of HRhV circulating in the general population\n2\n or whether HRhV co\u2010infection is beneficial to HBoV replication and pathogenesis remains unknown.

Globally, HBoV\u20101 strains have been reported to show low nucleotide and protein diversity; mean genetic diversity <1% at nt and <0\u00b75% at aa levels.\n44\n Comparatively, the diversity of HBoV\u20102, \u20103 and \u20104 strains, all identified in stool species, is far greater.\n8\n The low level of diversity reported worldwide amongst HBoV\u20101 strains has resulted in speculation that HBoV\u20101 evolved recently from the enteric bocavirus species, acquiring tropism for cells of the respiratory tract.\n8\n, \n46\n The organisation of the HBoV genome is similar to that of other Parvoviruses, namely that the non\u2010structural proteins are encoded by conserved genomic regions, whereas diversity is concentrated in regions encoding the capsid proteins.\n45\n Analysis of amino acid sequences obtained from Cambodian HBoV\u20101 strains revealed 0\u20132\u00b79% nt diversity and 0\u20133\u00b74% aa diversity amongst VP1/VP2 sequences. Greater variation amongst sequences encoding the VP1/VP2 capsid proteins was anticipated as VP1/VP2 is under pressure from host immune responses. The level of diversity amongst Cambodian NP1 sequences was 0\u20131\u00b71% at the nt level, which is similar to that recently reported by Kapoor et al.\n\n46\n Surprisingly, the level of diversity at the aa level amongst NP1 sequences was equivalent to that observed for VP1/VP2 sequences, at 0\u20133\u00b73%. Five amino acid substitutions were observed amongst Cambodian NP1 aa sequences, including Asn599 that has been reported previously by Ma et al.,\n47\n following analysis of HBoV\u20101 NP1 sequences obtained from Japanese children with ALRI. The observed diversity amongst Cambodian NP\u20101 sequences may have occurred as a result of immune pressure, as it was recently reported that the HBoV non\u2010structural proteins, including NP1, are targeted by humoral responses.\n30\n The potential impact, if any, of non\u2010synonymous mutations within this conserved region of the HBoV\u20101 genome remains unclear and warrants further investigation.",
