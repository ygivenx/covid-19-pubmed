Health education videos and posters featured cartoon pigs and birds combining viral material in North America that then skipped across the ocean to China. Several informants told me that the apparent increased virulence of the virus among those infected in Mexico, and the failure of the virus to spread quickly to China, could be directly attributed to racial-genetic differences between Chinese and Mexicans (renzhong bu yiyang), as well as to the genetic origins and characteristics of the virus itself. A microbiologist, for example, explained to me,Look at how many cases there are in the US. I think it\u2019s because the virus\u2019 genes have been found to be of Euro-American origins\u2014so it is more virulent in people with those genes, in the US and Mexico and Europe\u2014it passes more easily between people because they are better adapted to these genes. But in China it doesn\u2019t pass very easily\u2014it\u2019s because our genes are different. So although it keeps spreading in the US, after a few generations here it gets weak\u2014that\u2019s why all our cases are imported.\n",

A young epidemiologist from Shanghai who was training in Tianmai told me that as soon as H1N1 had spread to nearby Hong Kong and threatened to cross the border into Tianmai, the mayor of Tianmai called her infectious disease team and insisted that they track down all the Mexicans living in Tianmai and test them for H1N1, regardless of whether they had recently been to Mexico.

This is one reason why early in the initial H1N1 outbreak my informants displayed great confidence that H1N1 in fact could be both kept out of China and quickly brought under control. For them, the preferential infection of bodies associated with a virus\u2019 home region assured that though a virus may leave its originating space, the harm it could inflict on foreign spaces would be limited. SARS spread around the world, and it went to Toronto, but it remained Chinese through its genetic makeup and ability to target Chinese genes. And so when H1N1 came, it was this tendency to travel with a racial group that my informants imagined would protect them.",

These biomedical understandings generally hold that those native to a place where a virus emerges and circulates are less, rather than more, likely to be infected because long-term exposure allows the body to adapt and learn how to defend itself. By repeatedly being exposed to local pathogens, natives of a particular place build up partial immunity to those pathogens. Insofar as genetics may be involved, the same principle applies: sharing a common geographic ancestry with a pathogen allows for genetic adaptation over time.",

Exposure to this pathogen over time, the story goes, selected for a genetic adaptation that protected against malaria infection but had the unfortunate side effect of causing another debilitating disease. Thus, populations labeled as \u201cblack\u201d in the USA are categorized as more at risk for sickle cell anemia than Caucasian populations, due to an assumed link between blackness and genetic African ancestry (see Fullwiley 2007, 2011; Wailoo 2001). As with H1N1 and SARS, in the case of genetic malaria protection, shared geographical origins link an infection to a genetic population through the language of race. The difference in the case of the former is that shared geographic ancestry with a pathogen implied adaptive susceptibility to that pathogen, rather than protection.",

That is, my informants subscribed to standard epidemiological explanations of infectious disease spread at the same time that they subscribed to the views described in the previous section. As Volker Scheid (2002) has shown, most Chinese patients and doctors move fluidly between Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) explanations for disease, and modern Chinese medicine has not only mapped the Chinese body onto the Western anatomical body but has also mapped Western diseases onto the Chinese body (Kuriyama 1999). A similar type of fluid movement between languages and interpretations was evident in my conversations with Tianmai\u2019s public health professionals. In the same conversations in which they warned me that I had to exercise more caution than they did when interacting with H1N1 contact cases (because as a White American, I was more susceptible than they were to catching the virus), they would also trot out the latest epidemiological models from WHO and CDC to show me how the disease was moving from continent to continent.",

A common thread that runs through both biomedical and TCM origin stories of the SARS outbreak provided a basis for the diversion of racial blame to the Cantonese. Microbiologists and epidemiologists associated the emergence and spread of the SARS virus not just with Chinese people as a general category, but more specifically with the cultural practices and urban environments associated with southern Chinese people, especially Cantonese-speaking people from Guangdong Province. Similarly, practitioners of TCM blamed the SARS outbreak on the peculiar geography, culture, and type of body that TCM teachings also associate with southern China. Both origin stories promoted the view that the region of south China in which SARS originated fostered the development and the spread of infectious diseases, and both implied that these diseases might preferentially attach to south Chinese bodies. The resonance between these two origin stories promoted a logic of like-infects-like, with the originating continental and regional environments of both virus and carrier being the critical risk factors for infection. Thus, the internal racialization of Chinese subpopulations became a key component of the racialization of both Chinese and foreign viruses.",

Leibold (2011) noted that while \u201ca group of Chinese geneticists now argue that \u2018Y chromosome and mitochondrial (mt)DNA data have demonstrated a coherent genetic structure of all Han Chinese,\u2019\u201d this structure still \u201cexhibits a distinct pattern of variation among northern and southern Han people.\u201d And Gladney (2004) points out that most people in China distinguish physiologically between Northern and Southern Chinese, and especially between Northerners and Cantonese. Public health professionals hailing from both Southern and Northern regions frequently spoke of racialized differences in facial features and stature between Northern and Southern Chinese, the latter (especially the Cantonese) being described generally as darker, shorter, and less beautiful than their northern brethren, but also more \u201cclever\u201d (congming) and, historically, more mobile. Gladney points out that these attributes are given racial-genetic significance, despite official assertions that the Han is racially homogenous (2004, p. 433). According to Carrico, some Cantonese have embraced this claim of genetic difference, asserting that they have a separate ancestry from ordinary Han and even declaring themselves to be \u201can independent race\u201d (2012, p. 39).",

As small children pointed excitedly the way they might point at elephants in a zoo, young women declaring themselves to be Miao, Yi, and Hui dressed in colorful traditional costumes, danced, and played instruments (Chio 2014). As we watched the spectacle, my student leaned over and whispered that all of the performers were likely really Han. In Tianmai, there were very few Miao, Yi, or Hui people to play the parts, she explained. There were, however, many millions of Han migrants like the ones who were taken off of the bus, looking for work. The rural-to-urban migrants dressed in minority costumes illustrated how officially recognized racial or ethnic categories often diverged from, and at the same time merged with, the categories that took on the most significance in practice. Here, two different kinds of racialized Others merged into each other, the mundane but highly mobile Other coming to stand-in for the exotic that never quite managed to leave home.",

It also did not necessarily translate to a difference in geographical location: the floating population was officially rural, but it also made up a large proportion of the populations of most major urban centers in China. What\u2019s more, its members often hailed from the same areas of rural China from which my now-middle-class informants\u2014both Cantonese and non-Cantonese\u2014once migrated. This was especially the case for older public health professionals, almost all of whom had experienced deep rural poverty during their childhood and young adult years, and thus shared more with the migrants than they cared to admit. Thus, the racialization of the floating migrants remained incomplete. Other than the very fact of their continued mobility, it was difficult to differentiate between Us and Them, when Us and Them came from the same places and were thought to share the same genes.",
