Pulmonary pathology in HSCT patients with RSV infection may be mediated by the lung damage caused by prolonged viral replication. In this case, treatment with a drug that has strong antiviral activity may have a higher therapeutic efficacy in immunosuppressed patients compared with immunocompetent individuals infected with RSV because of the reduction in pulmonary damage caused by excessive viral replication.",

Immunosuppressed animals had more severe inflammation in the lung parenchyma (interstitial pneumonia) than non-immunosuppressed animals (Figures 4a and b). Immunosuppression and RSV infection were also associated with significant hyperplasia of the mucosal epithelium of the conducting airways, which was absent in non-immunosuppressed, RSV-infected animals (Figures 4a and b, compare top and bottom panels). Immunosuppressed, RSV-infected animals treated with a high-dose antiviral regime had little to no inflammation in the parenchyma and a significantly reduced epithelial hyperplasia (Figure 4b, compare top and middle panels), whereas intermediate-dose treatment was slightly less effective at reducing epithelial damage. These results suggest that the high-dose antiviral regimen reduces both pneumonia and airway epithelial hyperplasia in immunosuppressed animals infected with RSV. As the hyperplasia is a likely response to airway epithelial injury, these findings suggest that the high-dose antiviral regime may have either protected the animals from past or ongoing bronchiolar injury or may have enhanced recovery of the airway epithelium of immunosuppressed animals after the viral infection.",

            "text": "RI-002 infusion ameliorated pulmonary pathology associated with prolonged RSV replication in immunosuppressed cotton rats. Both elevated interstitial pneumonia and epithelial hyperplasia, features characteristic of immunosuppressed RSV-infected animals, were strongly reduced by RI-002. Antiviral therapy, therefore, appears more effective as a stand-alone treatment against pulmonary disease in immunosuppressed compared with normal cotton rats infected with RSV.22, 23 This suggests that excessive viral replication may indeed be a driving factor of RSV pathogenesis in immunosuppressed subjects and that RSV antivirals may have a higher therapeutic potential as a stand-alone treatment in immunosuppressed patients, but future studies in the human patient population are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In addition to antiviral activity, an anti-inflammatory activity, which is present in IVIG,37, 38, 39 could be beneficial and could have contributed to the disease-ameliorating effect seen in this work. Dissemination of microbial pathogens outside of primary target organs is also a significant problem for bone marrow transplant recipients.40 Dissemination of RSV in immunocompromised patients is not well documented, but RSV RNA has been detected in the blood and found to correlate with poor outcome of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in HSCT recipients.41, 42 Our results show that detection of RSV RNA outside of respiratory tract of immunosuppressed cotton rats was reduced by RI-002 treatment.",

            "text": "There is a well-defined segment of patients with immune deficiency diseases that require regular infusions of Ig to reconstitute their deficient humoral Ab compartment and who are also extremely susceptible to RSV disease.43, 44, 45 With the withdrawal of RespiGam from the market, an important IVIG product in the arsenal for controlling RSV disease in vulnerable populations is no longer available. The improved efficacy of IVIG vs palivizumab against RSV in HSCT patients17, 19 suggested that broader spectrum Ab may be required. A pivotal phase III RI-002 clinical trial in patients with immune deficiency disease has recently been completed.46 The favorable secondary outcomes that were achieved suggest that the unique Ab profile of RI-002 may have contributed to the positive results. RI-002 not only has higher titer Ab to RSV, but also contains significantly higher titers of Ab to other respiratory viruses including coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus and influenza virus (manuscript submitted for publication). Multiple respiratory viruses, including adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses have higher infection rates in HSCT recipients and may have prolonged viral replication in these subjects. Lower respiratory tract infection complication rates are high for RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenoviruses and human metapneumovirus (reviewed in Shah et al.47), suggesting that the polyvalent and broad antiviral characteristics of IVIG may be important in this patient population.",
