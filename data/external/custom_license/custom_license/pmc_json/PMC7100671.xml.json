We have also demonstrated the use of genome information that is generated from high throughput technologies for the translational research in diagnostic application. A new set of antipeptide antibodies was generated from the predicted ORFs of the structural and hypothetical proteins of the SARS-CoV. Immunohistochemical applications of these antibodies were validated on Vero E6 infected with SARS-CoV. Vero E6 is the prototype mammalian cell line that is used for SARS-CoV isolation in routine clinical microbiology investigations.3 In Vero E6 cells, positive cytoplasmic immunohistochemical signals were detected by at least one antibody from each predicted ORFs. The sequences of these peptides were unique and specific for the corresponding SARS-CoV protein. The specificities of these antipeptide antibodies were further determined experimentally with the suppression of immunohistochemical signals with excess corresponding peptides. In addition, in the study of tissue sections, only those cells with viral genome detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization were positive for immunohistochemical stainings for the antipeptide antibodies. These results demonstrated the existence of SARS-CoV known structural proteins and provide further evidence for the expression of those hypothetical proteins. The real identities of each of these hypothetical proteins require further investigations. However, our results indicated that at least the genome locations corresponding to the peptides selected for the putative ORFs were expressed. Further analyses of these hypothetical proteins by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments in tissue culture models will be required to confirm the expression and molecular weights of these proteins, to look for possible post-translation modifications and to identify the host interacting partners. The feasibilities of these antibodies to be used in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of archival clinical specimens were established in the current study. Antibodies SARS-AbS13a, SARS-Abs-16b, SARS-Abs-5a and SARS-AbS21a, against the nucleocapsid protein (N), the membrane protein (M), the spike protein (S) and a putative SARS 3a protein, respectively, appeared to provide strong immunohistochemical signals.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on all available tissues from nine autopsy cases of clinically confirmed SARS, two intestine biopsies of SARS patients and two liver biopsies. Positive cytoplasmic signals were observed in pulmonary pneumocytes and small intestinal surface enterocytes only. The existence of SARS-CoV in immunohistochemical-positive cells was proven by colocalization of the expressed proteins and viral genome in the same cells by dual immunofluorescence\u2013fluorescence in situ hybridization. Both the lung pneumocytes and small intestine enterocytes expressed the full sets of viral proteins. Although lung and small intestine were the primary targets of SARS-CoV infection, the responses of these two tissues were quite different. Tissue damage and organization, in the pattern of diffuse alveolar damage, were commonly observed in the lungs of SARS.13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Syncytial cell formation is rarely observed although characteristic. Little tissue reaction is, however, observed in the small intestine autopsy and biopsy sections.5, 13 Detailed studies of the expression levels and the interactions of viral proteins with host proteome may provide the answer. Much interest has been diverted to the study of known structural proteins, especially spike and nucleocapsid, in realizing the potentials of developing vaccines. The uniqueness of the hypothetical proteins to SARS-CoV, as compared phylogenetically to other known coronavirus, might be crucial to the clinical manifestation of SARS. At present, the functions of SARS-CoV hypothetical proteins and their roles in SARS pathogenesis are poorly understood. Recently, one of the putative proteins, SARS 7a was shown to interact with SARS 3a and the structural proteins in Vero E6.11, 12 These findings highlighted the potential, undervalued functions of hypothetical proteins in the pathogenesis of SARS.",

This might be due to the high sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction-based detection method that picked up the small number of viral genome in the scanty infected cells. Alternatively, serum contamination in the biopsy might explain the positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. It is, however, important to note that liver dysfunction was observed in SARS patients.14, 23, 24, 25 A high proliferation index was clearly demonstrated in these liver biopsy specimens.14 Hence, liver metabolism must have been perturbed in these patients.

In various in vitro systems using the spike protein, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)27, 28, 29 and the C-type lectins, CD20930 or CD209L,31 are identified as receptors of SARS-CoV. The distribution of ACE2, by itself, cannot explain the tissue tropism of the virus.26 The ACE2 protein has a much wilder cellular distribution32 than even the most extensive, although putative and controversial, list of organs and cell types harboring the virus.17 In the current study, the dendritic cells were not positive for IHC signals of any of the viral proteins in various different tissues. Lymphoid follicles immediately adjacent to infected cells were negative. SARS-CoV may exist only in low titer in the dendritic cells. Parallel to the situations in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis,33 the idea of dendritic cells as reservoir and immune mediator is attractive, the actual role of this cell type in SARS patients is not clear.",
