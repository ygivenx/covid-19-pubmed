All samples were analyzed at least 3 times. To confirm the specificity of each PCR product, we conducted a melting curve analysis immediately after the amplification phase of each PCR. The amount of RNA in each sample was expressed as the average value (copy number per weight [milligrams] of sample).",

On the basis of that report, primer HKU9-Leader42\u201364, including a leader sequence, was designed (Figure 2). The HKU9-Leader42\u201364 primer and 3siteAd20T primer, which included the oligo dT sequence, were used for PCR with RNA extracted from intestines of bats A and B. Amplicons were cloned, and partial genomic sequences of group 2d bat CoV membrane, nucleocapsid, Ns7a, Ns7b, and Ns7c genes were determined. These sequences were deposited in GenBank (DDBJ accession no. AB543561). A phylogenetic tree was also constructed with the deduced amino acid sequence (463 aa) of the complete N gene of group 2d bat CoV and available sequences of known CoVs. The tree showed the same topology as that constructed with deduced amino acid sequence of the partial RdRP gene. The N gene nucleotide sequence was most similar to that of Bat-CoV/HKU9\u20131/China/2007 (72% identity).",

Coronaviruses used for comparisons and their GenBank accession numbers are human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E (HCoV-229E) (NC_002645), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (NC_003436), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (NC_002306), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (AY994055), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (NC_005831), bat-CoV/A512/2005 (NC_009657), bat-CoV/A515/2005 (DQ648822), bat-CoV/A620/2005 (DQ648828), bat-CoV/A911/2005 (DQ648850), bat-CoV/GhanaKwan/19/2008 (FJ710046), bat-CoV/GhanaKwan/20/2008 (FJ710047), bat-CoV/M.das/Germany/D3.3/2007 (EU375854), bat-CoV/USA/RM-11 (EF544563), bat-CoV HKU2 (EF203064), HKU4 (NC_009019), HKU5 (NC_009020), HKU6 (DQ249224), HKU8 (DQ249228), HKU9 (NC_009021), CoV-HKU1 (NC_006577), human coronavirus (HCoV-OC43) (NC_005147), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (NC_001846), bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (NC_003045), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) (NC_007732), human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) (SARS-human) (NC_004718), civet SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-civet) (AY304488), bat-SARS-like coronavirus HKU3 (bat-SARS-CoV HKU3) (NC_009694), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (NC_001451), and turkey coronavirus (AF124991).",
