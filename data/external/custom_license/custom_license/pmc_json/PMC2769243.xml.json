            "text": "Induction of immunosuppression has become a standard therapy in the United States with over 70% of transplantation programs using agents to inhibit the first rejection response. The drugs most often used fall into three categories; 1) the interleukin-2 anti-CD25 selective blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as basiliximab and daclizumab, 2) polyclonal antisera against T-lymphocytes such as rabbit antilymphocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) or 3) the mAb alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) which targets T and B cells. The latter two agents have significant effects on B-cells. After an initial dose of 30 mg, Campath-1H profoundly suppresses T-cells for up to 330 days and B-cells for 90 to 150 days. Thymoglobulin significantly suppresses T-cells for up to 90 days and has a profound anti-B-cell effect from 15 to 980 days, opening many windows for opportunistic infection. (Figure 1).1\u201311 Clearly there would be an advantage for a shorter acting immunosuppression agent which allows T-cell recovery, has little or no effect on B cells and, therefore, does not produce profound long-term immunosuppression.",

            "text": "The therapeutic effectiveness of unmodified murine anti-T cell mAb in reversing acute human allograft rejection is dependent on the combination of both antibody isotype and idiotype interactions with their respective ligands or epitopes. The most successful are those specific for the CD3/TCR \u03b1\u03b2 antigen recognition complex.15 The mechanism of OKT3 action (a murine IgG2a mAb) includes interaction of its Fc portion with the high affinity Fc gamma receptor I that is present on monocytes. This produces immune activation followed by immunosuppression. T10B9, a murine IgM\u03ba isotype, is specific for the TCR \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer region of the CD3 complex, does not react with Fc gamma receptor I and thus exhibits reduced immune stimulation and the cytokine release syndrome. The TCR \u03b1\u03b2 specificity of T10B9 is defined by its ability to modulate the \u03b1\u03b2 but not the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR whereas OKT3 modulates both types of CD3 T cell receptors. Since T10B9 is directed against the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR and OKT3 against the CD3 \u025b (Epsilon) part of the CD3 complex, they differ idiotypically. They are isotypically different as well because T10B9 is an IgM\u03ba and OKT3 is an IgG2a murine isotype. Therefore, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) directed against one monoclonal antibody does not neutralize the other mAb; they are not cross-reactive. Indeed, patients with allograft rejection not responding to therapy with one monoclonal antibody have successfully been treated with the alternative agent.16 Attempts to fully humanize T10B9 have been unsuccessful to date; however, there is a chimeric mAb which appears to be comparable to the parent compound in vitro (JST, personal communication).",

Both T10B9 and OKT3 induced the DNA fragmentation definitive for apoptosis. The degree of apoptosis was quantitated using flow cytometric methods. The media control exhibited 18% apoptotic MC540 positive cells. This was increased to 38% following T10B9 incubation and 43% with OKT3.

One of the unique characteristics of T10B9 is its specificity for only those T lymphocytes that express the \u03b1\u03b2 T-cell receptor (TCR \u03b1\u03b2). Generally \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocytes compose between 95% and 98% of all T-cells in the peripheral blood. The remainder are T lymphocytes that express only the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR. In both mice and in humans, \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes are primarily located in proximity to epithelial tissues, including the skin, bowel and lung \u2013 all areas of the body that have early contact with the external environment.21,22 These \u03b3\u03b4 T cells play a major role in host first-line defense against bacteria, viruses, and fungi.23\u201329 An important function that differs from the \u03b1\u03b2 T lymphocyte population is the ability of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes to recognize and respond to such stimuli without the requirement for antigen processing and presentation by accessory cells. In this regard they contribute to innate immunity, ie, the ability to react quickly without requiring prior antigen processing.",

            "text": "Another important feature of their \u201cfirst-line defense\u201d is well documented in the skin. When skin is injured by any mechanism, a population of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes called dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC) responds quickly to injury and attach to keratinocytes (the primary cells of the skin). These DETC\u2019s secrete pre-growth factors (keratitic growth factors 1 and 2 and insulin growth factor 1) that stimulate regrowth of the epithelium. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in murine lung and is presumed to occur when injury occurs to any epithelial tissue. exposure to mild immune response. This capacity allows \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes to control a variety of infectious agents, such as Nocardia asteroids, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium bovis, Bordatella pertussis, etc.21,22,30 In tissue culture, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells killed tumor cells infected with viruses.21,22,24,31 Gamma/delta T lymphocytes are also able to modulate inflammatory responses in situ, ie, they can directly recognize molecules induced on epithelial cells by stress and respond very rapidly. They can also control the host immune response and thereby present or limit the immunopathology that may occur if there is a sustained response to the initial stress. Taken together it is clear that the \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes are actually a critical component of the immune system with particular reference to the control of many opportunistic infections and the maintenance of homeostasis. Currently, the drugs used for immunosuppression induction or the treatment of rejection suppress both the \u03b1\u03b2 and the \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes populations. For example, Thymoglobulin\u00ae not only suppresses T lymphocytes but also B lymphocytes and Campath-1H suppresses T and B lymphocytes and monocytes. There have only been two monoclonal antibodies that uniquely target the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR, T10B9 and BMA 031. These two differ by the fact that BMA 031 is mitogenic and T10B9 is not. Hence, their toxicity profiles are quite different.",
