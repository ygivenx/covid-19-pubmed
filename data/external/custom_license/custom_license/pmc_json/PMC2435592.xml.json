            "text": "The human formyl peptide receptor (FPR), expressed mainly by myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes), binds a large number of bacterial N-formylated peptides. The prototypic ligand for FPR, N-formyl\u2013methionine\u2013leucine\u2013phenylalanine (fMLF), was purified from Escherichia coli cultures (Marasco et al. 1984; Schiffmann et al. 1975). A recent study examined the activation of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells expressing FPR by formylated peptides from Listeria monocytogenes and found cellular responses at nanomolar concentrations (Rabiet et al. 2005). In addition, formylated proteins synthesized in mitochondria were found to bind FPR, suggesting that peptides released from necrotic tissue and sites of inflammation may attract neutrophils and monocytes (Carp 1982; Rabiet et al. 2005). It has also been observed that certain nonformylated peptides can bind to neutrophils through FPR. These include urea- and carbamate-modified peptides, viral peptides derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, HIV-2, Ebola, and Corona virus, annexin I, and cathepsin G (Derian et al. 1996; Hartt et al. 2000; Higgins et al. 1996; Mills 2006; Su et al. 1999; Sun et al. 2004; Walther et al. 2000). Thus, FPR binds a large number of peptides that can be of endogenous, bacterial, or viral origin.",

Based on haplotyping by Sahagun-Ruiz et al. and us (this study), haplotypes 1, 2, and 3 are among the most common in Caucasians. In the present work, we examined the effect of two bacterial peptides, fMLF from E. coli and fMFEDAVAWF from M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis, and one human mitochondrial peptide from cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, fMFADRW, on receptor signaling and chemotaxis. These studies were carried out in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing FPR haplotypes H1, H2, and H3. Our results suggest that these haplotypes may be differentially activated by the mycobacterial peptide. This may have important implications in the initial stages of for example inflammatory bowel disease, based on the finding that infection with M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis can be correlated with the disorder in a subset of patients (Subramanian et al. 2006).",

To establish whether different FPR haplotypes may have a role in the pathogenesis of RA, we carried out genotype and haplotype analysis of 74 Caucasian patients with RA and 74 controls. We observed only minor differences in haplotype distributions and, thus, it is unlikely that FPR plays a major role in the pathogenesis of RA.",

The coding sequence of FPR1, located in a single exon at chromosome 19q13.3, was amplified from 100-ng genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) essentially as described (Sahagun-Ruiz et al. 2001). Amplification utilized primer pairs FPR\u221241F22 and FPR+1063R22, where the first nucleotide of the primer is indicated by its position relative to the adenosine in the ATG translation initiation site, followed by F or R for forward or reverse and the number of nucleotides in the primer. Haplotypes were identified after ligation of the PCR amplicons into pGEM\u00ae-T Easy (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI, USA), and sequencing of the plasmid insert with T7 and SP6 primers. Haplotype 3 used in this study corresponds to the R-26 complementary DNA (cDNA; Boulay et al. 1990; GenBank accession number M60627).

Cells on the upper face of the insert were removed with cotton swabs; the cells that adhered to the underside of the filter were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, stained with hematoxylin Gill\u2019s stain, and the cell surface area from six random sites was quantified using an image analyzer (M4 True Color Image Analysis System, Imaging Research, St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada). Chemotaxis of CHO FPR H2 cells and CHO FPR H3 cells was always carried out simultaneously and the migration of the two cell lines was determined so that maximal chemotaxis of either H2 or H3 was set at 100% and the rest of the values were calculated accordingly.",

Antibodies that specifically recognize phosphorylated, activated ERK1/2 can be used to determine concentration and time dependence of activation. We have previously shown with a number of FPR mutants that FPR H3 activates ERK1/2 primarily through G protein, with only minor or no \u03b2-arrestin1/2-mediated activation (Gripentrog and Miettinen 2005). Thus, we decided to analyze whether the concentration dependence of H1, H2, and H3 differ from each other in response to the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase peptide fMFADRW, E. coli peptide fMLF, or mycobacterial peptide fMFEDAVAWF. Cells were incubated for 4 min with various concentrations of ligand and phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 was detected by western blot analysis. The activation of ERK1/2 using various concentrations of fMFADRW and fMLF was similar between H1, H2, and H3 (Fig. 2a,b). More significant differences were detected when fMFEDAVAWF was used as ligand (Fig. 2a,b). The most notable differences could be detected using 100-nM fMFEDAVAWF resulting in about 13\u201315-fold lower activation of ERK1/2 by H2 than by H1 and H3 (P = 0.008, one-way ANOVA). The differences in ERK1/2 phosphorylation became smaller at 1-\u03bcM fMFEDAVAWF but remained significant (P = 0.022).\n\n",

CHO transfectants were allowed to migrate for 4 h across a polycarbonate filter with 8-\u03bcm pores toward a lower well containing different concentrations of fMLF or fMFEDAVAWF. Most of the cells that migrated through the pores adhered to the underside of the filter and were stained for quantification by image analysis. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, cells expressing FPR H2 migrated with a fMLF concentration dependence similar to that of cells expressing FPR H3 but migrated poorly toward 100-nM fMFEDAVAWF, compared to cells expressing FPR H3 (P = 0.014). Based on the typical bell-shaped concentration curves (Fig. 4b), maximal migration of cells expressing FPR H3 toward fMFEDAVAWF occurred at 100 nM\u20131 \u03bcM, whereas cells expressing FPR H2 migrated maximally toward 1\u201310-\u03bcM fMFEDAVAWF.

We used the haplotyping nomenclature established by Sahagun-Ruiz et al. (2001). We identified three haplotypes with a frequency of >10% in the control population and/or in the RA population (1A, 2A, 4A) and 28 haplotypes with a frequency of <10% (Table 2). In addition, we identified one novel SNP, c.140T>C/p.V47A (haplotype 24A). Interestingly, the c.140C nucleotide was linked to nucleotides found in the 19A haplotype in all six cases and was only found in the control population. Another haplotype of interest, 16A, was found only in the RA population (four haplotypes out of 148). In both cases, the low numbers prevented any conclusions regarding RA association due to lack of statistical power. Chi-square analysis of the 2 \u00d7 31 contingency table suggested no clear relationship between FPR haplotypes and RA (P = 0.209. \u03c72 = 36.0, df = 30). Upon pooling the haplotypes based on amino acid sequence rather than nucleotide sequence, the P value was 0.071 (\u03c72 = 21.1, df = 13). This study demonstrated that a very large number of FPR haplotypes exists and only two SNPs (c.568T/p.W190 and c.140C/p.A47) show strong linkage disequilibrium with the other SNPs. Therefore, FPR SNP typing alone without corresponding haplotype analysis may not be sufficient to uncover disease associations.\n\n",

For example, inflammatory bowel disease is thought to occur in people with a delayed or insufficient innate immune response toward bacteria that have penetrated the mucosa of the gut (for review, see Bouma and Strober 2003). The human gut contains 500\u20131,000 bacterial species and about 80% of these have not yet been cultured or characterized. The role of bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease remains controversial with results both favoring and discounting their role (Sartor 2006; Subramanian et al. 2006) One of the prominent bacteria described in cases of Crohn\u2019s disease is M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis. Analyses of mycobacterial DNA or antigens in Crohn\u2019s disease have produced both positive and negative results (Autschbach et al. 2005; Brunello et al. 1991; Romero et al. 2005; Suenaga et al. 1999). Similarly, antimycobacterial therapy has been successful in some but not all cases (Borody et al. 2002; Jarnerot et al. 1989; Schultz et al. 1987). Thus, individual genetic differences may determine susceptibility toward bacteria of different origins.",

            "text": "Studies from the past 6\u20137 years show that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human receptors that recognize bacterial products can result in Crohn\u2019s disease. The best known example is the CARD15 gene, where a frameshift and two missense variants alter the function of the CARD15-encoding cytoplasmic protein, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2; Hugot et al. 2001; Ogura et al. 2001). NOD2 binds a bacterial muramyl dipeptide and activates nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, an important transcription factor in innate immune responses (Inohara et al. 2003). An estimated 8\u201317% of Caucasian patients with Crohn\u2019s disease have two copies of the main risk alleles, whereas none of the three CARD15 mutations have been found in Chinese, Korean, or Japanese Crohn\u2019s patients (Croucher et al. 2003; Leong et al. 2003; Tosa et al. 2006). This provides strong evidence for the presence of genetic heterogeneity among patients from different ethnic backgrounds. Other genes linked to Crohn\u2019s disease belong to the family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and include genes encoding TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR6 (Franchimont et al. 2004; Gewirtz et al. 2006; Pierik et al. 2006). Both NOD2 and the TLRs belong to a class of pattern recognition receptors of the immune system that recognize conserved pathogenic motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Thus, Crohn\u2019s disease seems to be associated with the inability to recognize bacterial motifs and to respond to them through signal transduction events that result in proinflammatory defense (such as activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway). In a genome-wide association study testing over 300,000 autosomal SNPs in inflammatory bowel disease (Duerr et al. 2006), the Illumina HumanHap300Genotyping BeadChip included only one FPR SNP (c.1037C>A/p.A346E). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether FPR is associated with inflammatory bowel disease.",

These studies were carried out using stably transfected CHO cells. The CHO transfectants display many of the same responses toward bacterial peptides as neutrophils, including chemotaxis, and therefore provide an excellent model system for these studies. We first examined the concentration-dependent activation of ERK1/2 with the human mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase peptide fMAFDRW, E. coli peptide fMLF, and M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis peptide fMFEDAVAWF. The responses between the haplotypes were similar toward the E. coli peptide, whereas FPR H2-mediated activation of ERK1/2 with the mycobacterial peptide required a significantly higher concentration than in the case of FPR H1 and FPR H3. The subsequent experiments measuring receptor downregulation further supported the notion that FPR H2 was functionally different from FPR H1 and FPR H3 in response to the mycobacterial peptide; a significantly higher concentration of the peptide was required for half maximal downregulation of the receptor and the peptide exhibited a reduced affinity for FPR H2. The most conclusive evidence that these differences could have physiological implications in our defense against bacteria, was obtained with the chemotaxis assays. In these experiments, CHO cells expressing FPR H2 showed significantly reduced migration toward lower concentrations of fMFEDAVAWF compared with CHO cells expressing FPR H3, while the responses toward the E. coli peptide fMLF were comparable between the haplotypes.",

FPRL1 which requires fMLF in the micromolar range for activation was activated by three mitochondrial peptides with almost equal potency as FPR. However, when the activation efficiency was compared using peptides derived from Listeria monocytogenes, only FPR was activated in the low nanomolar range (Rabiet et al. 2005).

            "text": "The coding sequence for FPR1 contains six nonsynonymous and four synonymous SNPs. The reason for this large diversity in receptor sequence is unknown, but we hypothesize that evolution favors these polymorphisms to allow FPR binding of peptides from a wide variety of microorganisms and other infection\u2013inflammation sources. Some of the nonsynonymous SNPs cause significant changes in the amino acids, such as p.R190W and p.N192K, which may partly determine ligand binding specificity and affinity. Our previous studies suggest that the ligand binding site of FPR maps in the transmembrane region, potentially in close proximity to amino acids 190 and 192 (Miettinen et al. 1997; Mills et al. 2000). Because H1 and H3 have an arginine (R) at position 190, this amino acid may interact with the aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) side chain, or the phenylalanine (F) C-terminus of fMFEDAVAWF and increase the affinity of the peptide, compared to tryptophan (W). Because we have previously determined that R201 is the site of formyl group binding (Mills et al. 2000), R190 is appropriately positioned to interact with the C-terminus of fMFEDAVAWF provided that the peptide binds parallel to helix V. In addition, because fMFEDAVAWF has a charge of \u22123, R190 may facilitate the entry of this negatively charged peptide into the binding pocket. The mitochondrial peptide fMAFDRW has a charge of \u20131 and is two residues shorter than fMFEDAVAWF and exhibited similar activation of all three haplotypes. Therefore, FPR from different individuals may show variation in binding properties to microbial and mitochondrial peptides, which may affect the neutrophils\u2019 response to microbial invaders or tissue injury. Reduced or enhanced ligand binding may thus affect the outcome of a bacterial infection and in combination with other susceptibility factors contributes to inflammation.",

            "text": "The role of FPR variants has been previously examined in aggressive periodontitis (AP) but not in other inflammatory disorders, to our knowledge. A study by Zhang et al. (2003) found a significant association of two SNPs, c.A568 (p.R190) and c.G576 (p.K192), with the AP phenotype in 38 African\u2013American patients (compared to 23 controls) but not in Brazilian or Turkish patients when expressed together. A role of FPR in AP can easily be rationalized because AP is associated with bacterial infections (Henderson et al. 2003). However, the role of FPR in RA has not been established due to lack of a clear correlation between RA and bacterial contamination. Certain bacteria, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have been associated with RA, and it has been theorized that infectious agents may initiate the disorder. A case-control study showed that the presence of antibodies against M. pneumoniae was associated with RA (P < 0.001, OR 2.34; Ramirez et al. 2005). A correlation between RA and other Mycoplasma strains has also been reported (Haier et al. 1999; Horowitz et al. 2000). Thus, a relationship between bacteria and RA has been shown, but it remains to be established whether bacterial infection is the cause or the result of RA. A connection between RA and mitochondrial peptides and cathepsin G in the synovial fluid appears plausible, although these peptides are clearly not the cause of RA, but may instead exacerbate the ongoing inflammation. Because chronic inflammation is characterized by the continuous infiltration of neutrophils, any information that can lead to inhibition of this activity would be medically important.",
