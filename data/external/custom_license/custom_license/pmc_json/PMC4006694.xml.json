            "text": "Felis catus has been domesticated for over 9,000 years and presently numbers 0.5\u20131.0 billion worldwide. Medical surveillance of this most common companion animal is extensive, and over 250 hereditary pathologies common to both cats and humans are known1. The F. catus genome was recently sequenced at light (1.9\u00d7) coverage and a 10\u00d7 assembly is imminent2. Over 90% of identified cat genes have a human homolog, and compared with the mouse there are fewer genomic rearrangements. Intermediate size, prolific breeding capacity, similarity of systems to humans, abundance, modest costs and the neurobehavioral complexity of a Carnivoran make the cat of value in experimental settings ranging from neurobiology to diverse genetic, ophthalmologic and infectious diseases. These include conditions in which mice or rats are not useful on the basis of disease susceptibility, organ size or other factors1. Cat transgenesis is thus of interest for both human and cat health research and potentially for developing ways to confer protection from epidemic pathogens to free-ranging feline species, all 36 of which now face the threat of extinction3.",

The causative lentiviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and HIV-1, are highly similar in genome structure, disease manifestations and host cell dependency factor use4,5. The differences between these lentiviruses are also informative and potentially exploitable. For example, species-specific lentiviral restriction factors such as TRIM and APOBEC3 proteins6 restrict FIV and HIV-1 with distinctive patterns7,8,9,10. These genes have not been studied in a controlled manner at the systemic and species levels by introduction into the genome of an AIDS virus\u2013susceptible species (Old World primates or felids). Given the challenges inherent to macaque transgenesis, the AIDS virus\u2013susceptible cat would be singularly positioned for such studies if it can be accessed by genetic approaches used in mice. In contrast to primates, feline species lack antiviral TRIM5\u03b1 genes11 but have potently restrictive APOBEC3 proteins9,10, which sets up intriguing possibilities for testing such genes at the whole-animal level, for conferring gene-based immunity with them or engineered variants12,13, and potentially for HIV-1 disease model development10.",

For the live kittens, we collected cells for protein analyses by oral mucosa scrapings (which showed GFP-expressing squamous epithelial cells), and blood and semen collection. Both transgenes were expressed in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but with notable variation (Fig. 3a,b). Percentages of GFP-positive cells as determined by FACS were 15\u201380% in TgCat1, TgCat2 and TgCat3 and increased gradually as the kittens aged (Fig. 3b,c). TgCat2 had the most GFP-positive cells in the PBMC compartment, being about 65% GFP-positive early in life and then over 70\u201375% later (Fig. 3a\u2013c and Supplementary Fig. 3). Several specific aspects here are interesting for developing models that will depend on lymphocyte or monocyte lineage expression. First, irrespective of promoter used, FACS and immunoblot detection of GFP and rhTRIMCyp in PBMCs in living cats required activation by phytohemagglutin-E (PHA-E) and interleukin 2 (IL-2), and GFP expression increased steadily with time in culture (Fig. 3c). Fluorescence intensity was variable (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Second, driving GFP expression from a minimal CMV (mCMV) promoter element adjacent to the PGK promoter was effective in TgCat2, but we observed only low GFP expression with the same vector in TgCat1, although even in this cat GFP expression increased steadily from rare positives to 14.8% by 20 months (Fig. 3b,c). Third, all three cats expressed hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged rhTRIMCyp in the bulk PBMC population as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3a). TgCat1 consistently expressed more rhTRIMCyp than the other two living cats by quantitative western blot analysis. However, this protein was more difficult to detect than GFP, and was clearly visualized by immunofluorescence, using an antibody to the HA tag, in only a fraction of the cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Even so, rhTRIMCyp transgenic cat PBMCs displayed resistance to FIV replication, with the greatest resistance to replication seen in cells from the cat that expressed the most rhTRIMCyp (TgCat1; Fig. 3d). The resistance to FIV replication was partial, as predicted for cell populations that express such a restriction factor partially19.",

Therefore, the transgenesis procedure preserves fertility, and the germline is transduced. Transgene expression persisted in the F1 offspring of transgenic F0 parents, indicating that silencing did not occur (Fig. 4). Matings of TgCat1 with three nontransgenic queens produced five additional kittens from three pregnancies. Similar to the sire, they were less surface green-fluorescent but were strongly 'PCR- and Southern blot-positive' (data not shown); of these one died perinatally owing to dystocia associated with a hypocontractile uterus.

The approach enables transgenesis by germ cell genetic modification for the first time in this species and in any carnivore. Notably, we achieved uniformly transgenic outcomes, which reduce screening cost and time. A second implication of the high efficiency and the copy numbers achieved is that it should be possible to titrate vector dose down or to microinject a mix of vectors into one oocyte to produce complex multi-transgenics. The approach is accessible: feline oocytes competent for efficient transgenesis are readily obtained noninvasively and without added animal procedures from ovaries discarded during routine spaying (laparoscopic or ultrasound-guided percutaneous oocyte retrieval is also feasible). In vitro blastocyst development rates were higher than had been seen previously with SCNT-developed transgenic embryos (19\u201320% versus 3%)14. We prevented mosaicism by microinjection before IVF and observed germline transmission. The persistence of transgene expression in F1 cats is encouraging for establishing useful transgenic lines. The lack of multiple inbred strains of cat, a current limitation, could be addressed in a focused breeding project.",

Several questions can therefore now be addressed. First, it is unknown whether introducing a single active restriction factor into the genome of an AIDS virus\u2013susceptible species can protect it, and if so, at which of three broadly considered levels: transmission, establishment of sustained viremia and disease development. When antiviral genes are interrogated at the whole animal level by transgenesis in a natural host, results can be surprising and informative. For example, a recent transgenic intervention against influenza in chickens prevented secondary virus transmission to transgenic and nontransgenic contacts, but it had no effect on mortality after primary virus challenge20. Because species-specific lentiviral restriction factors have not been tested by controlled experimental introduction into an animal, the most fundamental question directly answerable with the approach is whether restriction factor transgenesis can mimic natural experiments that normally take place over large expanses of evolutionary time, with selection by viral culling, and render a species genetically immune to its own lentivirus. It is not possible to make clear predictions. For example, there are natural macaque and sootey mangabey TRIM5 alleles that do not block simian immunodeficiency virus transmission to animals that carry them but appear to constrain extent of replication in vivo and to exert selection pressure on the capsid21. When breeding expansion is completed with our present restriction factor transgenic cats, FIV challenges can be done.",
