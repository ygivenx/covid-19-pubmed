Although influenza A virus can cause recurrent epidemics, there have also been occasional severe pandemics. These, for example, include the global outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009 and the spread of influenza A(H7N9) virus in 2013 [1\u20133]. Serious outcomes of influenza infection and complications can be observed in certain group of patients, especially elderly and young children [4]. Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis is important to help planning of treatment regimen i.e. optimization of antiviral therapy, reduction of antibiotic use, and prevention of transmission [5].",

To help aid clinical judgment and diagnosis of influenza, a number of different techniques has been developed. These techniques include viral culture, molecular assays, and rapid antigen diagnostic tests [6, 7]. Although viral culture and molecular assays allow the information regarding the identification of the outbreak strain and subtypes to be made, they are time-consuming techniques and often require sophisticated and expensive equipment [8]. Unlike other approaches, result interpretation of rapid antigen diagnostic tests can be made within 15\u201320 min of specimen collection and does not require laboratory expertise.",

The majority of these tests are based upon the detection of target analyte on a given platform. These platforms; for example, include paper-based device, membrane-based assay, and lab-on-a-chip device [9, 10]. Such platforms provide advantages of simplicity, portability, inexpensiveness, and rapid analysis for analytical applications. Of these systems offering rapid testing analysis, the capillary-driven platform called \u201clateral flow immunochromatographic assay\u201d [11]. Within the system, the target analyte is captured between two specific recognition molecules such as antibodies, forming a sandwich complex [12]. In most cases, the test employs two specific antibodies, one of which is conjugated to the reporter molecule, whilst the other is immobilized on the solid support [13]. As the complex flows along the test device, it is separated from sample matrix via capillary force on the porous membrane [14]. Once captured, the target detection can be accomplished via an optical signal readout from the labeled sandwich complex, providing a direct colorimetric visualization.",

Previous systems using different sizes of gold nanoparticles to form the dual-layered gold nanoparticles have been reported [15, 16]. Different systems using either other reporter molecules or other signal enhancement techniques [17] such as fluorescent dyes [18, 19], near infrared dyes [20], magnetic nanoparticles [21], silver enhancement [22], surface-enhanced Raman scattering based [23], enzyme amplification [24], and double-antigen targeted strategies have also been reported [16]. However, these systems often require either additional instruments or steps for result interpretation [25]. Alternatively, the use of carbon nanomaterial as a reporter molecule has a great potential for its use in various applications. Due to its unique properties, for example, good chemical stability, biocompatibility, and high contrast, the use of carbon nanoparticles as reporter offers a good prospect for designing a detection platform for biomedical diagnostic application [26].",

When the sample containing the target antigen was used as a sample, the antigen was captured by carbon nanotag antibody immunoprobes loaded on the conjugate pad of the test strip. As the sample migrated through a porous membrane by capillary action, the antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex was separated gradually from sample matrices by the mean of chromatography and continued to move along the test strip. Once the complex reached the nitrocellulose membrane, it was bound with the capture antibody immobilized on the membrane, forming a sandwich antibody-antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex (Fig. 2a). The accumulation of the carbon nanotag sandwich immunocomplex in the fiber pores of the membrane at the test spot area resulted in the color change in signal detection from no color to black color (SEM image, Fig. 2a). The excess immunoprobes continued to move along the test and was bound to secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody at the control line.

As depicted in Fig. 3a, as the concentration of the target virus antigen was increased, the detection signal strength was shown to be higher. This suggests that the detection signal was increased gradually proportional to the number of the target influenza A virus present in the sample. The higher signal strength can be attributed to the increased number in the clusters of carbon nanotag labeled sandwich immunocomplex on the test spot area. With a direct signal visualization, a black spot detection signal can be observed visually at the concentration at 3.5 \u00d7 102 TCID50.mL\u22121.

Different approaches using nanoparticles to either concentrate the sample, enable the signal detection, or amplify the signal were also reported with various detectable level of target influenza protein and virus particle. These platforms; for example, include electrochemical sensor, integrated microfluidic system, and field-effect transistor system [31\u201333]. Other systems using similar immunoassay principle were also investigated. Whilst Zhang et al. reported europium nanoparticle-based immunoasssay for a detection of influenza virus with the limit of detection of 101 to 103 egg infective dose (EID)50.mL\u22121, a paper-based immunoassay using gold nanoparticle to enable a detection of influenza virus with a range of 2.7 \u00d7 103 to 2.7 \u00d7 104 plaque-forming unit per assay was described [34, 35]. It should also be noted that the antibody specific to influenza virus used in this system is different to those of other systems. In this system, the antibody chosen as a targeting ligand is specific to the nucleoprotein, rather than other proteins such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are more susceptible to antigenic change. Nucleoprotein is recognized as one of the most abundant proteins in the virion and is less sensitive to antigenic drift. This, therefore, provides an advantage to the system by enabling the detection of all subtypes of influenza A virus to be possible, compared to other systems.",

With regards to the previous lateral flow immunoassay systems reported for the detection of influenza virus, dual-layered and double-targeted gold nanoparticles and fluorescent dye-doped silica nanoparticles were used as reporters [16, 19]. However, it should be noted that the strategies of using either different size of gold nanoparticles in combination with combined antigen detection method or fluorescence based method are more complicated strategies, compared to the single-label direct visualization system.
