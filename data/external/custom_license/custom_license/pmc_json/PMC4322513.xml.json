            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae and is classified in the genus Pneumovirus. RSV is the most common cause of fatal acute respiratory tract infection among infants and young children [1]. Virtually every infant has been afflicted with an RSV infection by the age of 4 years, and reinfection may occur throughout life [2,3]. Moreover, RSV infection has been encountered by almost all people in South Korea before reaching adulthood [4]. Mortality data from several studies suggest that RSV is a significant cause of death in early childhood. Such child death comes from an acute lower respiratory infection, especially following pneumococcal pneumonia or Haemophilus influenza type b [5,6]. Recent studies indicate that RSV is an important cause of respiratory infection in elderly patients, either those with compromised immunity or inflicted with chronic illness, as well as in adult populations in a special environment, such as military personnel [7-11]. RSV tends to be more variable and clinical manifestations seem less distinctive in adults than they are in children, and the viral cause of the infection is often unsuspected [12-15].",

Twenty-two patients were admitted to the hospital with cardinal symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Among them, 5 patients who underwent diagnostic tests were selected through random sampling by utilizing Microsoft Office Excel 2003. The throat swab samples collected from these 5 patients were sent to the Seoul Clinical Laboratories and Seoul Medical Science Institute for analysis. Throat swab was carried out by smearing the posterior aspect of the pharynx with a sterile cotton swab while the tongue was pressed down with a tongue depressor. The smear was done by rotating the cotton swab 360\u00ba, three to four times. Viral transport media were utilized to transport the samples in a refrigerated condition. A multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed with a Seeplex RV6 detection kit (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) for six types of respiratory viruses (RSV, adenovirus, influenza A, influenza B, para-influenza, and metapneumovirus). The PCR amplification was performed using a T3000 thermocycler (Biometra, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). A retrospective investigation for all 588 patients was conducted using computerrecorded patient charts. The clinical characteristics of the disease and types of therapeutic regimens were obtained from these records. This study also examined cases with upper respiratory infection (URI) that occurred in the basic training camp of the ROKAF for the last three years. This investigation also examined all the URI-associated diseases in the military. The numbers of patients with diseases recorded as acute nasopharyngitis, acute laryngopharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, tonsillitis, acute URI, or URI were acquired from the system of military medical information management.",

Together, the recruits have used the same dining and training areas for about two months, and two of their quarters are located 100 m away. Contact with outsiders is prohibited during the training period (Figure 1). Acute febrile illness occurred collectively among military recruits starting from May 26, 2011. On a suspicion of influenza A (H1N1) in the early phase of an epidemic, a rapid antigen test, an immunofluorescence assay, and a multiplex RT-PCR assay were carried out for all 11 patients with early onset of fever at the Armed Forces Medical Research Institute, South Korea, on June 3, 2011. However, these results were all negative. Calling attention to thorough patient examination, segregation, and preventative activities to prevent further incidences did not reduce the incidence of febrile disease, owing to its clustered occurrence since June 9, 2011. Preventative measures included the management of personal hygiene, such as the wearing of a mask by all recruits, thorough hand washing, and restricted sharing of personal items. Further measures comprised instantaneous reporting of symptom development, medical diagnosis, treatment, and segregation. Additional preventative measures for food-associated personnel were reinforced. Patients largely had complaints of fever of 38\u00b0C or higher, as well as other URI symptoms. Their symptoms were managed well by administration of antipyretics and antibiotics, as well as supportive care, such as fluid therapy. Patients with such symptoms improved after about one to two days of hospital treatment and were discharged from the hospital. The incidence of acute febrile disease continued for approximately two months, but it ceased after July 27, 2011, which marked the end of the epidemic.",

Any clustered occurrence of acute febrile illness had to be reported to the central epidemiological investigation team and was subjected to the fever management protocol. In times of clustered occurrences of acute febrile illness, as opposed to ordinary years when there is less development of acute febrile illness, as a matter of duty, such incidences must be reported to the Medical Division of Headquarters, which should be followed up by an epidemiological investigation in accordance with the Fever Management Protocol.

This epidemiological investigation suggests the prospect of RSV as a causative pathogen of respiratory tract infections that could intensively occur among young recruits undergoing basic military training. The RSV-caused URI would not foster immunity in patients, and re-infection might develop throughout one\u2019s life. This epidemic with RSV as the etiologic agent had the characteristic manifestations of a common cold, such as high fever and infectivity. Supportive care in the acute phase for two to three days led to a favorable prognosis. None of the patients had any severe complications, and all of them returned to the barracks after the treatment and safely completed their training programme. Nevertheless, this epidemic, which lasted for two months, led to a setback in the military timetable and might have caused damage to military strategy.",

Fever duration was significantly longer in the group of patients administered an antibiotic or antiviral drug (oseltamivir), despite the fact that there had been no difference in body temperature measured after their hospital admission. Such results may be due to the fact that patients with severe symptoms and long-term hospitalization received an additional antibiotic or antiviral agent. Moreover, patients who delayed seeking care might be more likely to receive an antibiotic or antiviral agent. Another explanation for such results would be the fact that the antibiotic treatment or inappropriate antiviral regimen might not have been particularly effective in the RSV epidemic. This would provide the basis for a suggestion that favorable prognosis in RSV infections might be attained by supportive care in a healthy young adult group. This study verified that there could be a possibility of reoccurrences of RSV-induced epidemics, and supportive care alone would lead to an amicable prognosis in a healthy young adult group.",

            "text": "The major limitations of this study were the fact that the PCR assay only measured samples from five patients, and also that RSV subtypes have not been investigated. The fact that patients with fever largely had similar clinical manifestations, and that five randomly selected patients, among 22 symptomatic subjects, were all RSV positive, would highly support the idea of RSV as the causative agent of this epidemic. In the test performed after 5 patients had been randomly selected from 22 inpatients, the fact that all 5 patients were positive suggested the probability that many more of the inpatients might have been RSV positive. Utilizing the fever management protocol, the ROKAF has monitored the collective development of acute febrile illness since 2008. However, the fact that there were only two outbreaks since that time, H1N1 outbreak in 2009 and the outbreak examined in this investigation, points to the possibility that they were caused by the same pathogen. Furthermore, given that the subjects of this study inhabited their quarters, dining and training areas together for an extended period of time, this epidemiological association may be quite high. The epidemic curve also showed the typical pattern of a droplet-mediated respiratory infection with manifestations of infections inflicted by contacts among people. The symptomatic manifestation of upper respiratory tract infection in adults, unlike that of infants, concurred with that of other previous studies [20-22]. An additional limitation was the fact that some military trainees had refused medical care due to concern for their training scores. According to the fever management protocol, it is obligatory that any military trainee with a fever must receive medical treatment. In consideration of this aspect, the actual attack rate could be higher, and this might explain the cause for the extended epidemic lasting as long as two months. The introduction of an infrared thermal camera system may be necessary to promptly identify patients with a fever in the military boot camp. Of the 588 cases, only 408 patients with sufficient chart records were analyzed. This may have led to the exclusion of mild cases and a depiction of the outbreak as more severe than it was. This consideration may, however, support the result of this study that healthy young adults with an RSV infection might have a good prognosis even when receiving only simple supportive care.",

            "text": "In an attempt to prevent a military RSV epidemic, the introduction of an effective RSV vaccine, for which studies are currently in progress, would be worth consideration, if it could be made commercially available [23]. In the event of an epidemic of acute febrile respiratory illness of a highly infective nature, it is recommended to conduct a test for RSV in the young adult population in the military facilities. Clinical courses can be predicted through such activity, and they may also decrease unnecessary antibiotic use. Clinicians may also consider an appropriate antiviral regimen, such as ribavirin, when required [24-26]. The strong possibility that RSV was the causative pathogen for the collective development of this acute febrile illness in the military services foretells that incidences of such infection may multiply rapidly for a long time, as witnessed in this epidemiologic investigation. Thus, rapid detection and segregation of febrile patients, along with installation of an infrared thermal camera system, are necessary. Furthermore, personal hygiene should be promoted. RSV is unstable in the environment, surviving only a few hours on environmental surfaces, and it is readily inactivated with soap and water [18]. Methods of preventing RSV infection include not sharing utensils or cups, avoiding kissing others, covering coughs and sneeze, and washing hands frequently and correctly [19]. And military movement should only be considered when patients are totally recovered and without infectivity. Owing to the characteristics of frequent military mobility, there is a high tendency for propagation of respiratory viral infections to personnel in other military units. In an attempt to prevent those military trainees with high infectivity from moving to other military units during this epidemic, they were directed to move to other military facilities after they had been completely recovered and their infectivity lost. Such measures could have prevented the further spread of this epidemic to other military units. Military planners must focus on how best to control the spread of infectious respiratory diseases in highly mobile military populations [27].",
