Acute exacerbations are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality (9, 31, 34) and preventing exacerbations remains a major unmet need. There has been increasing interest in a recently identified subgroup of patients with COPD, who are at risk of exacerbations, defined as the \u201cfrequent exacerbator phenotype\u201d. (19) Patients with frequent exacerbations have worse clinical outcomes, including increased morbidity (31), accelerated lung function decline (9), and greater mortality (36), suggesting that this group requires special consideration. To date, the underlying mechanisms that predispose such patients to more frequent exacerbations have not been elucidated. It is plausible that abnormalities in host immunity could underlie an increased propensity to exacerbations.",

However, not all studies have shown this abnormality (1, 20), suggesting that it may vary according to disease phenotype. Frequent exacerbators could represent one subgroup in whom defective antiviral immunity is more prominent. Both experimental and naturally occurring exacerbation studies also confirm that an initial virus infection can precipitate secondary bacterial infection in COPD (13, 21). Although bacterial colonization at a stable state has been shown to be associated with increased exacerbation frequency (26), propensity to develop secondary bacterial infection during virus infections in frequent versus infrequent exacerbators has not previously been studied.",

The study protocol was approved by the East London Research Ethics Committee (study number 11/LO/0229), and all subjects gave informed written consent. The subjects all had a clinical diagnosis of COPD that was confirmed with spirometry. All subjects had an initial visit at baseline when clinically stable (infection-free without antibiotic treatment or treatment with oral corticosteroids for at least 8 wk) for clinical assessment, spirometry [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF)] and clinical sample collection, including spontaneous or induced sputum, taken and processed, as previously described (22, 27). At the baseline visit, all subjects were asked about the number of exacerbations experienced in the previous year and were divided into two groups: frequent exacerbators (\u22652 exacerbations in preceding year) and infrequent exacerbators (0\u20131 exacerbations in the previous year), as previously described (38). Subjects then had repeat visits at three monthly intervals when clinically stable and were followed up for a minimum of 6 mo. Subjects reported to the study team when they developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or an increase in any of the symptoms of dyspnea, cough, sputum volume, or purulence. Exacerbation was defined using the East London cohort criteria (9). Subjects were seen within 48 h of onset of their symptoms for collection of samples, and repeat visits were carried out at 2 wk after the initial exacerbation visit. Samples from this cohort have been used in a previous study investigating the role of airway glucose in COPD (23).",

All subjects included gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (05/08/10/3.09). Primary cells were grown in complete bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM) (Lonza) with growth factor supplements in submerged monolayer culture and then seeded at 2 \u00d7 105 cells/mL in Transwell plates until confluent. RV-A1 infection [multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1] was applied to the apical surface for 2 h in 250 \u03bcl bronchial epithelial basal medium (BEBM) minimal at 35\u00b0C. Following this, infection media were replaced with 500 \u03bcl fresh BEBM minimal for the remainder of the experiment. Samples were collected at 72 h postinfection with apical media removed and stored for protein expression analyses. Type III IFN proteins were measured using a custom-designed LEGENDplex kit (BioLegend). IFN-\u03b2 was measured using the Verikine ELISA (PBL). Half of the Transwell membrane was also carefully cut from the inserts and collected into RLT buffer (Qiagen) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for downstream molecular analyses by RT-quantitative PCR. The remaining Transwell membrane was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 h for histological cross sections to confirm differentiation (33).",

To investigate this, we measured sputum bacterial loads by 16S quantitative PCR in subjects with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbation. There were no differences in sputum 16S bacterial loads between frequent and infrequent exacerbators at baseline or exacerbation onset (Fig. 6, A and B).

We show here, for the first time, that patients with COPD, who have a history of frequent exacerbations, have reduced airway antimicrobial immunity when assessed at clinical stability and during subsequent virus-associated exacerbation with an associated increase in bacterial loads. We additionally confirm that COPD frequent exacerbators have reduced ex vivo immune responses to RV infection in primary airway epithelial cells, indicating an innate antiviral deficiency. Our data provide an important mechanistic advance in understanding this clinically important COPD subgroup.

Patients with COPD also have increased virus loads and enhanced exacerbation severity when experimentally infected with rhinovirus (10, 22). However, defects in antiviral immunity have not been shown universally with other studies reporting the opposite effect of augmented ex vivo antiviral responses in COPD (1, 20). The discrepancy between these COPD studies suggests that defective immunity may not be present in all patients with a number of confounding competing factors, such as disease severity and medications likely to have an influence. It is plausible that patients with frequent exacerbations might represent one subgroup with impaired antiviral immunity. Here, we report that expression of both type I and type III IFNs, IFN\u03b2, and IFN\u03bb2/3 mRNAs is reduced in frequent exacerbators at stable state, suggesting that these patients might have a reduced potential to generate protective responses to virus infection. In support of this hypothesis, we also observed that antiviral responses, including IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03bb1, and IFN\u03bb2/3 and the ISGs 2\u2019-5\u2032OAS and CXCL10/IP-10 were suppressed during exacerbations in frequent exacerbators and that RV induction of IFN\u03bb1, 2\u2019-5\u2032OAS, and Viperin mRNAs in BECs ex vivo was also reduced in frequent exacerbators.",

We were unable to corroborate these data with medical records due to the heterogenous nature of locations at which these exacerbations will have been reported and managed (self-management, primary care physician-directed therapy, or hospitalization), preventing a systematic approach to data retrieval. It is also important to note that a relatively short follow-up period was adopted in this study. Since exacerbations may be influenced by seasonal variation in influenza rates, a longer-term follow-up period may offer more accurate information. This short follow-up in our study makes it unsuitable for testing the hypothesis of whether baseline deficiency in antiviral immunity predisposes to subsequent increased frequency of virus-induced exacerbations. An adequately powered study with longer follow-up would be required to formally test this. Our study shows that subjects with prior history of frequent exacerbations have reduced expression of antiviral immune mediators, but it is not a prospective evaluation of this hypothesis. In a study with a much longer follow-up period (median 1,047 days), frequent exacerbators experienced significantly more coryzal episodes than infrequent exacerbators (18), which supports that this phenotype is potentially associated with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Previous studies have also indicated that exacerbation risk in COPD is dynamic and may change from year to year (16, 19), suggesting that factors other than increased clinical attendances (and, thus, potential exposure to viruses) associated with prior frequent exacerbations may govern subsequent exacerbation risk. A longer-term study with repeated airway sampling would be needed to determine whether baseline antimicrobial responses are similarly dynamic in nature.",

            "text": "Identification of an underlying mechanism to explain our observation of impaired antiviral immunity in frequent exacerbators is challenging due to confounding factors, such as inhaled corticosteroid use, making it difficult to determine immune abnormalities that are inherently due to disease phenotype. Previous studies have indicated that frequent exacerbators have increased systemic and local expression of proinflammatory cytokines (5, 11). In the current study, we showed trends toward increased baseline production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and CCL5/RANTES, hinting that chronic airway inflammation could contribute to defective antiviral responses upon infection observed in some patients. A previous study in airway epithelial cell cultures demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokine exposure impaired epithelial expression of cathelicidin (29), an antimicrobial peptide that has antibacterial and antiviral properties (4, 7). Exposure to proinflammatory cytokines can induce persistent epigenetic changes that modify innate immune responses. IL-13 exposure of airway epithelial cells from donors with asthma-induced, long-lasting modification of DNA methylation (25). We have previously reported increased RV-induced type I IFN expression in NF-\u03baB p65 heterozygous mice (p65+/\u2212) compared with p65+/+ mice associated with lower expression of inflammatory COX-2 (2). This is consistent with negative regulation of IFN signaling by inflammatory pathways. Further studies are needed to investigate whether proinflammatory cytokines can similarly impair interferon expression in COPD and the mechanisms underlying this effect.",
