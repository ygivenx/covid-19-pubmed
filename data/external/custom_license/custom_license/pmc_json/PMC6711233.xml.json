Furthermore, we obtained the expected total number of cases in 2016, 2017, and through September 2018, conditional on the incidence of community-acquired cases, by simulating 10,000 times from the distribution of human-to-human\u2013transmission cluster sizes observed during 2014\u20132015. Thus, the observed incidence rates in these years could be compared with simulations to test the null hypothesis that human-to-human transmission levels remained constant since 2014\u20132015 (yielding a 2-sided p value). The intervals reported are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the simulations (95% CIs). We examined a range of mortality rates from healthcare-associated outbreaks in South Korea and Saudi Arabia (3,5) and the case-fatality ratio (CFR) from all reported cases globally (35.5%, 800 fatalities/2,254 cases) (9). When numbers of cases averted were not statistically significant, we truncated the lower bound of the 95% CI to 0 cases averted.",

We assessed potential components of this reduction (i.e., reduction of community-acquired cases, human-to-human transmission cases, or both). The incidence of community-acquired cases was 177 in 2016, 151 in 2017, and 86 through September 2018 (Appendix Table). These rates were each significantly (p<0.001) lower than expected compared with the incidence in 2014\u20132015 (334 for 2016, 334 for 2017, and 251 through September 2018). Conditional on the number of community-acquired cases, we observed no significant reduction in the risk for secondary cases from 2014\u20132015 to 2016, 2017, and through September 2018, although we did find nonsignificant trends. We estimated that 154 secondary cases (95% CI 0\u2013495) were averted from the 177 community-acquired cases in 2016, 96 (95% CI 0\u2013419) from the 151 community-acquired cases in 2017, and 80 (95% CI 0\u2013338) from the 86 community-acquired cases through September 2018, totaling 330 (95% CI 0\u2013819) from the 414 community-acquired cases during 2016\u2013September 2018 (Table). Assuming a 20% CFR (3,10), these 330 (95% CI 0\u2013819) cases averted correspond to 66 (95% CI 0\u2013164) expected deaths averted; assuming a 35.5% CFR (9), they correspond to 117 (95% CI 0\u2013291) expected deaths averted.",
