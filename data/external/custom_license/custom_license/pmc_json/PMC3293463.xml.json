            "text": "To rectify this situation, we proposed a multistage Richards model, 1 stage for each of the S-shaped segments resulting from multiple waves of infection during this outbreak. Stages are distinguished by turning points (or inflection points), denoting acceleration after deceleration at the end of each S-shaped segment, the local minima of the corresponding incidence curves. For an n-phase epidemic outbreak, n \u2013 1 local minima separate the n phases. For illustration, the incidence curve for Toronto given in Figure 2 contains 2 peaks (local maximum or turning point of the first type) and 1 valley (local minimum or turning point of second type). The multistage Richards model procedure requires 5 steps. First, fit the Richards model to cumulative cases on successive days by using a standard least-square routine. For single-phase outbreaks, parameter estimates (a, r, ti, K) will converge as the trajectory approaches carrying capacity K, as demonstrated in the Taiwan and Hong Kong SARS outbreaks (7,9). Second, if estimated parameters remain convergent until no more new cases are detected, the outbreak has only 1 phase. However, if the estimates begin to diverge from heretofore fixed values, one knows that a turning point denoting the start of a second phase has occurred. Third, locate the turning point, tmin, separating 2 S-shaped phases of the epidemic as the local minimum of the incidence curve (Figure 2). This is the curve for S\u00b4(t) given in the equation (1). Fourth, fit the Richards model to the cumulative case curve again, but starting from tmin + 1, the day after the start of second phase. The estimated parameters (a, r, ti, K) will again converge as the curve approaches the carrying capacity K for the second phase. Finally, repeat steps 2\u20134 in the event more phases occur until the outbreak ends.",

We again fit the model to the cumulative data ending on various dates past May 25; the results are given in Table 3 and Figure 4. The estimates start to converge after June 4, in the last 2 rows of Table 3 in bold, yielding an estimate for K of 248.96 (95% CI 246.67\u2013251.25). Once again, the actual case number of 249 for the Toronto area outbreak (and 250 for Canada) is well approximated by our estimate of K. The estimated turning point ti = 26.36 pinpoints May 24, or a turning point for SARS infections 5 days earlier on May 19. This finding further corroborates Health Canada's assertion that, among the 79 cases that resulted from exposure at the hospital where the index patient of the second phase stayed, 78 had exposures that occurred before May 23 (11). Note also that this estimate is obtained by using data that end just 11 days after the turning point on May 24, giving an accurate prediction of the actual cumulative case number (Figure 4).",

April 22 was the second turning point, at which time persons infected by the undetected index patient for the second wave began to experience symptoms. Our findings also concur with the World Health Organization action that lifted a travel advisory issued on April 22 that limited travel to Toronto. In retrospect, the Toronto outbreak would have ended with the first wave, if not for the single undetected case and subsequent infections that occurred before April 22. Furthermore, our results also corroborate the assessment of Health Canada, which pinpointed April 21 as the start of the second phase of the outbreak in Toronto area.

Both points can be aptly illustrated by the Toronto outbreak. By using data from 2/23\u20134/14, we can predict the 95% CI of cases in the first phase of this outbreak at 137.34\u2013148.22, 10 days before the phase ended. Incidence data 20 days after the inflection point of the first phase (March 25) would have enabled us to project the severity of the epidemic, had there not been a second wave of infection. By performing daily fits with updated case data, one could determine if parameters were converging to reliable values for the current phase of the outbreak. Similarly, for phase 2 of the Toronto outbreak, 11 days after the final inflection point (May 24), the data from April 28 to June 4 give a good estimated 95% CI of the cumulative cases of 246.67\u2013251.25, 8 days before onset of the last case.",

To compare with results (9), we also assume the duration of infectiousness T to be 8.4 days, as estimated from the time from onset of symptoms in the index patient to onset of symptoms in a secondary case-patient in Singapore (12) and obtain R0 = exp[rT] = 3.41. The estimated r = 0.136 for Taiwan outbreak in (7) yields R0 = 3.08. Note that, because of the shift in the cumulative number used for the model fit of the second phase, the resulting value for r cannot be used in this simple calculation. A list of basic reproduction numbers for SARS in affected areas computed in literature by using Richards model and T = 8.4 is given in Table 4 for comparison. The larger basic reproduction numbers for Toronto (phase 1) and Taiwan, as compared with Hong Kong and Singapore, may be attributable to the relatively high percentage of nosocomial infections (13,14).",

During an outbreak such as SARS, to which available data were limited and uncertain, a simple model that requires only the most basic and perhaps only easily obtainable data under these circumstances offers our best chance to a practical solution to the understanding, prediction, and timely control of the outbreak. However, one must understand that mathematical models do not provide accurate numerical predictions and can be used to forecast only in fairly gross terms (15). The accuracy of predictions depends heavily also on the assumption that no stochastic events occur in the remaining days that could significantly alter the course of the current phase of an outbreak.",
