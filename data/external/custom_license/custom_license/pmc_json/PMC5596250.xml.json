The initial inflammatory stage is quickly counterbalanced by an anti-inflammatory response, which compromises the immune system and leads to immunosuppression. Recently, the failure of clinical trials testing anti-inflammatory drugs to treat sepsis has been attributed to immunosuppression, also known as immunoparalysis. Anti-immunosuppressive therapies offer a novel treatment option in the medical community. In clinical settings, the application of granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor has been found to reverse sepsis-associated immunosuppression and to restore monocytic immunocompetence in septic patients.2 Nevertheless, difficulties persist in differentiating the inflammatory stages of sepsis and in determining the major immunological pathways underlying immunosuppression.",

C5a is one of the most potent inflammatory peptides and has a broad spectrum of functions. C5a has been found to inhibit neutrophil innate-immune functions such as reactive oxygen species generation, phagocytic ability, and chemotaxis. It has also been observed to be indirectly involved in thymocyte apoptosis, leading to the destruction of the central immune system.3 Moreover, C5a serves as a master switch for the intracellular pH balance in neutrophils, altering neutrophil inflammation and metabolism.4 The blockade of C5a or its receptor C5aR inhibits the development of sepsis and markedly improves survival in animal models.5 Thus, C5a has been recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis (Figure 1).",

Generally, C5aR and C5L2 function independently, and the putative \u2018default\u2019 receptor, C5L2, has an important role in balancing the biological effects of C5a.7 Considering that the C5a functional receptor is not expressed in lymphocytes, the effect of C5a on the immune system is likely to be mediated by a \u2018middle man.\u2019 In a previous study, we found that complement C5a regulates IL-17 by affecting the crosstalk between DCs and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in a cecal ligation perforation (CLP)-induced sepsis model.8 However, the direct role of C5a on lymphocytes remains unclear.",

The interaction of C5a with C5aRs on neutrophils leads to pleiotropic effects, including the release of cytokines and chemokines, as well as the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Inappropriate activation and homing of neutrophils to the microvasculature contributes to the pathological manifestations of sepsis. We previously observed that reduced C5aR expression due to the presence of excess C5a was associated with the functional impairment of neutrophils and poor prognosis in septic patients. Hence, C5aR expression levels can serve as an early marker for predicting the severity of sepsis.9 In fact, other immunocytes such as DCs, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells (NKTs) and CD39+Tregs were all found to be involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis, and the pathogenic effect of interferon-\u03b3-producing NKT cells was mediated by enhancing the production of C5a.10 Furthermore, the overexpression of Th1 and Th17 cells in sepsis was also found to be related to C5a.11 Hence, the association between immunocytes and the complement should be further investigated.",
