All subsequent samples from the same patients were then tested until three consecutive samples were negative; the first negative sample defined the time of negativation. RNA from clinical samples was extracted by using the QIAamp virus RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as instructed by the manufacturer. Total RNA was then reverse transcribed with random hexamers, and cDNA was amplified with two primer pairs. The first pair, COR-1/COR-2, is one of the primer pairs recommended by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/SARS/primers/en/). The second pair, R1/R2, was designed to amplify a 220-bp fragment of the replicase gene (R1: 5\u00b4 AGG TTA GCT AAC GAG TGT GCG 3\u00b4, R2: 5\u00b4AGC CTG TGT TGT AGA TTG CGG 3\u00b4). These two primer pairs, COR-1/COR-2 and R1/R2, had been selected among others (including Cor-p-F2/Cor-p-R1, Cor-p-F3/Cor-p-R1, SAR1s/SAR1as) for their higher sensitivity (87% and 95%, respectively), using serologic testing as the standard. Congruence between the results of the two tests was 86% (F. Tang, pers. comm.). Only specimens with positive results for both primer pairs were considered positive, so that false-positive results were eliminated. During this procedure, positive and negative controls were systematically included and treated in the same way as the virus sample.",

Survival analysis was performed by using time to RT-PCR negativation as the outcome variable (for stool and sputum specimens separately). Survival curves were built by using the Kaplan-Meier method.

RT-PCR sputum and stool specimens did not show negative results until day 14 and day 16 after disease onset, respectively (Figure). The median (range) duration of viral excretion was 21 (14\u201352) days for sputum samples, and 27 (16\u2013126) days for stool specimens. Negative RT-PCR results occurred at the same time in sputum and stool samples for 45 patients, and at a later time in stool samples than in sputum in 11 patients (the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between time to RT-PCR negativation in sputum and stool was 0.65, p < 0.0001). Four patients had viral excretion in stools after 100 days; three of these patients had coexisting conditions, such as pulmonary tuberculosis (2 patients), diabetes (1 patient, who also had tuberculosis), and high blood pressure (1 patient). The proportion of patients with coexisting conditions was significantly higher for patients with viral excretion >100 days compared to others (3/4 vs. 3/52, p = 0.003, Fisher exact test). All attempts (n = 12) to isolate virus from RT-PCR\u2013positive stool specimens collected >6 weeks after disease onset failed. All 56 patients had at least one close contact. Clinical symptoms suggestive of SARS did not develop in any of the 70 close contacts of convalescent SARS patients we surveyed.",

The median duration of viral excretion was 3 weeks in sputa and 4 weeks in stool samples. This estimate might be high, since some patients with no or short viral excretion might have been missed because of the study design. In most patients (45 of 56), the duration of viral excretion in both specimens was identical, while it was longer in stool samples compared to sputa for 11 patients. The long duration of excretion (>100 days after onset of symptoms) observed in stools of four patients suggests that independent replication of virus may take place in the intestinal tract. Three of these four patients had coexisting conditions, a known risk factor for prolonged SARS illness (13,14). Prolonged viral excretion may have important public health implications if responsible for spread of the virus to other persons or to the environment. Two findings of this study are reassuring in this regard: one is the failure of all attempts to isolate the virus from positive RT-PCR specimens collected in convalescent patients, which suggests that excreted virus was no longer infectious; the other is the absence of SARS in close contacts of convalescent patients during the study period.",
