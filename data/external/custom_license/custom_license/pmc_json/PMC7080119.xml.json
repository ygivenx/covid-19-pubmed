            "text": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) appeared as revolutionary technology almost 25 years ago, when the first commercial instrumentation was launched on the market by Pharmacia Biosensors AB, a Swedish company, derived from Pharmacia AB. The company developed an innovative technology by the joint effort of physicists, chemists, biologist, engineers, and computer scientists. Since then, many scientists joined the SPR to test new applications in various analytical fields, such as food safety [1] (e.g., mycotoxins [2], genetically modified organism (GMO) [3]), microbial contamination such as Escherichia coli [4], doping analysis [5], laboratory medicine [6, 7], proteomics [8, 9], bacteria detection [10], and also environmental monitoring [11]. Among them, assuredly, clinical analysis has also been explored as a fruitful application field.",

The binding between analytes and bioreceptors immobilized on the sensing surface causes a local change in refractive index (Fig. 1) and the variation of the propagation constant \u03b2, generating a real time signal in label-free way, since no labels have to be added in solution for the development of the analytical signal. Classic SPR spectroscopy is based on the monitoring of coupling angle, coupling wavelength, intensity, phase [15], whereas SPR imaging (SPRi) is based on the measurement of reflectivity of monochromatic incident light at a fixed angle by means of a CCD camera. Compared with traditional SPR, SPRi offers main breakthroughs such as multiplexed detection (by designing 2-D patterned microarrays of molecular probes) and the real-time visualization of the whole biochip surface to monitor simultaneously multiple bioreceptor/analyte bindings with the parallel support of a digital image, representing the intensity of binding in a color scale [19]. On the other side, SPRi suffers from order of magnitude worse resolution than classical SPR (10\u22126 versus 10\u22127 RIU) [17].",

Here we will present and discuss works that appeared in the last years aiming at developing robust and reliable SPR assays in clinical diagnostics. Among bioreceptors, we can enumerate antibodies, nucleic acid probes or synthetic receptors (molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs), aptamers, or artificial DNA (XNA). Accordingly, it is customary to talk about immunosensors, nucleic acid sensor, aptasensor, and so on. An immunosensor uses the affinity interaction between an antigen and an antibody [26, 27]. Nucleic acid (NA) sensors are based on oligonucleotidic probes and NA hybridization reaction [25, 28]. In NA sensors, artificial nucleosides (XNA) oligomers have also been employed as bioreceptor for clinical applications. XNAs increase sensor stability by avoiding biodegradation or exploiting improved affinity of XNA versus the target sequence compared with conventional DNA probes. D\u2019Agata et al. reviewed works dealing with the great potential of artificial DNA (PNA, LNA, HNA, and MORF) in nucleic acid SPR-based sensing, exhibiting higher selectivity and sensitivity in detecting complementary or mismatching nucleic acid targets [29].",

More recently (2012), Bedford et al. have specifically reviewed the recent trend of incorporation of GNPs within the sensing surface itself or as tagging molecules in SPR biosensor. Significant sensitivity increases and DLs decreases were described for a variety of analytes [41]. As reported by Minunni and Spoto, the increase of sensitivity is explainable by both the mass enhancement of the NPs in the EW as well as by the optical coupling between surface plasmons (SPs) and electric fields of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) of NPs when they are close to the metallic surface [38]. LSPs are defined as collective electron oscillations confined in the MNP surface and promoted by interaction with the light. If the MNP dimension is much smaller than the wavelength of the excitation light, the local electromagnetic fields are strongly enhanced. A further contribution to the increase of sensitivity is also expected if NPs clustered since it was proven that clusters of spherical metal and dielectric colloids show strong electric, magnetic, and Fano-like resonances from the electromagnetic coupling between closely spaced particles [38].",

The functionalized surfaces showed several advantages such as high surface-to-volume ratio, adsorption of organic or biological molecules (pi stacking), passivation against oxidation, and controlling the number of graphene layers [43]. Other strategies, different from NPs-based approach, have been also adopted in this last decade for the improvement of SPR based sensor.

A detection limit of 0.016 \u03bcg/L (\u223c34 pM) in urine diluted with TM buffer (1:5, 1:10 and 1:30) was rapidly achieved in 2 min without complicated sample pretreatment and with a good reproducibility (CV% <0.71 %). The assay was fast and inexpensive compared with traditional method based on RIA, HPLC-MS, or HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection. It required less clean-up steps, resulting an efficient way to monitor E3-16G production rates in urinary samples of a normal menstrual cycle [46].",

They detected first hGH (growth hormone) in human serum samples (mixed 1:1 in PBST), essential for development and normal growth [48]. Then they also performed, using the same strategy, the single and multi-analyte determination of two other gonadotropic hormones in urine and serum sample (both mixed 1:1 in PBST): follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH) and luteinizing hormone (hLH) involved in the development and function of the reproductive system [49]. Finally they detected hGH, hLH, hFSH, and hTSH (thyroid gland stimulation for thyroxine production) in urine and serum sample (again both mixed 1:1 in PBST) using an indirect immunoassay coupled to multi-analyte sensor. All biosensors resulted sensitive (about \u03bcg/L (\u223c40 pM) as DL for each analyte), reusable from 50 to 100 consecutive assay cycles and specific for each analyte. The SPR based immunoassays resulted reproducible with mean intra- and inter-day CVs about 7 %, appearing as a highly reliable tool for endocrine real-time and daily monitoring in clinical laboratory compared to official methods as RIA, IMA or ELISA [50].",

The approach suggested a model for future protein multi-array for MDS diagnosis based on protein\u2013protein interactions. The assay resulted in being less sensitive than conventional detection of sVEGFR-1 based on ELISA, capable of detecting 0.02 \u03bcg/L and up to 0.5 \u03bcg/L, respectively, for healthy individuals and MDS patients [63].",

Interesting examples of the combined use of artificial DNA and SPR, able to enhance sensitivity of diagnostic SNP investigations, were eventually reported in literature [29].",

ABCB1 is a key gene in pharmacogenomics, with many SNPs implicated in a common set of problems such as altered drug levels and susceptibility to diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, refractory seizures, and CD4 cell recovery during human immunodeficiency virus therapy) [106]. The sandwich assay was based on the optimization of sample pretreatment (fragmentation and denaturation) coupled to a rational design of very selective and performing probes. In particular, thiolated capturing probes, immobilized on the sensor surface, hybridized the target (ABCB1 gene fragment) while a secondary probe hybridization confirmed the selectivity of the capturing [105].",

            "text": "In summary, SPR-based biosensors offer analytical performances (sensitivity, DLs, and reproducibility) comparable to conventional methods employed in clinical analysis (electrophoresis, chromatography, ELISA, RIA, etc.); in addition, they ensure real-time monitoring, label-free solutions, parallel analysis (SPRi), high throughput, little sample pretreatment, fast responses, and cheapness. For all these reasons, we believe that in the near future, SPR will emerge as an efficient, powerful, and alternative tool for daily routine clinical analysis, opening also new horizons for future developments in personalized medicine and in point of care diagnostics.",
