In particular, CoronaViruses are prone to recombination [6,7] and like all other viruses they mutate at a high frequency [8]. This makes extremely hazardous to try to trace the origin of the virus. Nevertheless, this prompted us to investigate their relationships using the RNA word usage hoping to identify some RNA viruses that display similar word usage pattern. Such RNA viruses might hint about the origin of SARS-CoV. This study will contribute to our understanding of the RNA word usage of SARS-CoV and some other pathogenic RNA viruses. In the present study, we explored the relationships of 31 RNA viruses, which are known to cause diseases to their corresponding hosts with either similar symptoms or infectiousness, including SARS-CoV, based on their global tetra-nucleotide usage pattern.",

The overall gene order for this novel pathogen supported its placement in the family of Coronaviridae which includes the animal/human CoronaViruses. It should be emphasized that the sequence similarity shown is attributed mainly to the large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replication enzyme or RdRp) residing in the first two open reading frames (ORFs). These two ORFs constitute more than 65% (>20 kb) of the total genome size and these regions are more conserved in their nucleotide sequences due to their specialized role for viral RNA replication. Therefore, the possible relationship based on the sequence of the replication enzyme alone was also investigated.",

Bovine CoronaVirus (BCoV) and Human CoronaVirus 229E (HCoV) favor the U nucleotide (35.5% and 34.6%) at the expense of the C nucleotide (15.3% and 16.7%). Relatively strong nucleotide biases are visible in the other genomes and we will mention a few of the extremes. The highest base count is 28.4% G in the Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), 38.9% A in the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), 35.5% U in the Bovine CoronaVirus (BCoV) and 28.5% C count in the Foot-and-Mouth disease Virus (FMV). The lowest base counts are 15.8% G in the Human Respiratory syncytial Virus (HRV), 21.2% A in the Equine arteritis Virus (EV1), 20.9% U in the Igbo Ora Virus (IOV) and 13.6% C in the Bovine ephemeral Fever Virus (BFV). The A nucleotide is the most popular base among RNA viruses (ranging from 21.2% to 38.9%), and C is the most variable nucleotide (ranging from 13.6% to 33.1%).",

Among the 31 virus sequences examined, the frequencies of occurrence for di-nucleotide were not randomly distributed, with only a few exceptional di-nucleotides starting with a purine residue present at the expected frequencies (ApC, ApG, GpC, |z| < 3). A remarkable deviation from the expected frequencies occurs for the di-nucleotide pairs CpG and UpA (suppression or under-representation, z < -50) as well as di-nucleotides pairs CpA and UpG (enhancement or over-representation, z > 40). These di-nucleotide biases, together with mono-nucleotide bias [13], have a direct impact on the codon usage of viruses. For example, in the codon usage for the 24 protein coding sequences in human CoronaVirus 229E (Table 3), only 2.85% of codons contain the under-represented subword CpG di-nucleotide whereas 11.26% of the codons contain the over-represented CpA di-nucleotide (the aggregate codon usage containing each di-nucleotide subword without mono- and di-nucleotide bias is close to 6.25%).",

            "text": "In double stranded DNA genomes the deficiency in di-nucleotide CpG is often supposed to be due to the fact that they are the targets for methyltransferase activity that leads to cytosine deamination [14,15]. It is however unlikely that the mechanism of deamination that alters the genetic contents at the DNA level would affect the viral RNA content of most RNA viruses without a DNA stage. There might exist specific cytosine RNA methylases that could be responsible for this effect [16]. However it is more consistent to propose that, unlike the mechanism of cytosine deamination in the DNA realm, the dominating process is cytosine deamination in RNA viruses, converting cytosine to uracil (C \u2666 U) instead of thymine (T). As a consequence of this mechanism, di-nucleotide CpG changes to either di-nucleotide UpG or CpA in the direct/complementary strands of RNA viruses and causes the over-representation in di-nucleotide UpG and CpA (z > 19). Interestingly, there is experimental evidence in vitro that the rate of cytosine deamination is faster (>100 times) in the single stranded than in double-stranded state [17]. Apart from the under-representation in di-nucleotide CpG and over-representation in di-nucleotide CpA and UpG, the reason for the observed di-nucleotide UpA scarcity in RNA may be explained by its chemical lability [18]. The UpA dinucleotide is chemically the most unstable among the 16 dinucleotides. Furthermore, UpA appears to be a preferential target for ribonucleases [19]. This lability would create a selection pressure against di-nucleotide UpA in RNA viruses.",

The result based on the replication enzyme sequence was included because these regions in RNA viruses are submitted to a strong selective pressure to ensure successful replication of their own RNA in the host cell. The two distance trees can be clustered distinctly into two major groups of viruses. Interestingly, this clustering validates our approach, since these clusters are consistent with biological properties of the viruses: Group #1 corresponds to all positive strand ssRNA viruses while Group #2 corresponds to negative strand ssRNA viruses. Each group must undergo different evolutionary paths which lead to their distinct pattern in tetra-nucleotide usage.

From the family of positive strand ssRNA viruses, CoronaViruses form the largest cluster. The SARS-CoV is found to be at the basal position of other CoronaVirus types and remains closest to the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGV) and Feline CoronaVirus (FCoV). This placement is consistent with the findings from two seminal papers [9,10] where the SARS-CoV was classified in a separate group from the rest of the known CoronaViruses. In addition, both distance trees suggested that the Bovine CoronaVirus (BCoV) and the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) should be grouped together whereas the Human CoronaVirus 229E (HCoV) is the closest to the Porcine epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PDV). For the family of negative strand ssRNA viruses, there are two obvious classes that have evolved through different branches of word usage pattern. The first class covers Hantaan Virus (HV1), Reston Ebola Virus (REV), Bovine Ephemeral Fever Virus (BFV), Bovine Respiratory syncytial Virus (BRV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Human Respiratory syncytial Virus (HRV).

These model chromosomes were generated by obeying the Markov model of the order (m - 1)th. This can be achieved by shuffling m - 1 viral nucleotides as one whole unit so that the nucleotide successions up to order (m - 1)th were being preserved. Several statistical approaches have been proposed for quantifying word biases [27,28]. In this study, we employed the z statistics (Equation 1) for di-nucleotide and tetra-nucleotide biases [27,28]. The z value is a measure of the bias of a word, with values close to zero meaning no bias, negative values meaning under-representation and positive values meaning over-representation of the word w in the RNA text.",

However, perfect positive correlation (r = 1) does not mean identity of the paired Vi, but, rather, identity up to positive linearity, that is, identity between the paired standardized values. This is a crucial property of r (scale-invariant) that enables the comparison of viral genome despite their differences in genomic sizes. Positive magnitude of r indicates positive association whereas negative magnitude of r indicates negative association between two usage patterns. For this study, correlation coefficient, r, for let say virus 1 and virus 2, is defined as follow:",

Such matrix has a diagonal entry of value 0. For the purpose of constructing a relationship tree, only the lower/upper triangular matrix of M is required. After obtaining lower/upper triangular matrix of M, the neighbor-joining method (NJ) algorithm was used to construct the relationship tree (Figure 1). The neighbor-joining method is based on minimum-distance principle. Details of the NJ algorithm are available in [29].",

It seeks to discover if the observed usage patterns can be explained in terms of a much smaller number of un-correlated pattern sets called factors (eigen-vectors). Suppose we take a simple case where there are 31 viruses each represented by two components (x,y) in vector V (x,y represent the frequencies of occurrence for two specific tetra-nucleotides). Then, in a scatter-plot we can think of the regression line as the original X-axis, rotated so that it approximates the regression line. This type of rotation maximize the variance of the variables (x,y) on the eigen-vector. The remaining variability around this the first eigen-vector was captured in the subsequent eigen-vectors. In this manner, consecutive eigen-vectors are extracted but with a diminishing importance. What each eigen-vector represents is the embedded RNA word usage patterns communalised by a group of viruses presumably under the same selection pressures.",
