However, in February 2017, outbreaks of severe diarrhea occurred in swine herds vaccinated against PEDV in Guangdong, China. All ill pigs showed severe watery diarrhea, and their clinical onset occurred a few days later than those infected with PEDV. In initial tests with reverse transcription PCR using specific primers for PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine group A rotavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus, none of these viruses could be detected in all clinical samples. Furthermore, the recovered sows showed no seroneutralizing antibodies against PEDV.",

After 2 days, all inoculated animals exhibited similar clinical symptoms, including diarrhea and dehydration. We randomly selected 2 inoculated pigs in each group and performed necropsies on days 3 and 5 postinoculation, respectively. We filtrated homogenate of small intestine and intestinal contents, using the resultant supernatant for RNA extraction as described previously (2). We extracted total RNA by using a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and eliminated ribosomal RNA with the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After reverse transcription PCR with random primers, we performed 150-bp paired-end shotgun metatranscriptome sequencing on the cDNA libraries by using an Illumina HiSeq system.",

According to the phylogenetic tree, the position of GDS04 is between HKU2 and BtRf alphacoronavirus. The HKU2 strain was identified in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, China, in 2007 (6), and the BtRf alphacoronavirus strain was detected in China in 2012 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_028824.1). Both viruses are bat-associated viruses. However, the 2 strains are distributed in relatively different branches (Figure). Based on a comprehensive comparative analysis of the genomes of various groups of coronaviruses, we classified GDS04 as an alphacoronavirus. Our sequence analysis revealed that GDS04 has 80% nt and 87% aa identity with the spike (S) protein of the HKU2 strain. Moreover, the S protein of the GDS04 genome is 6 bp longer than the S protein in the HKU2 strain, which has the smallest S protein among all coronaviruses. Nevertheless, the GDS04 strain shares 95.7% aa identity with HKU2 in nonstructural protein (nsp) 3 (adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase), 96.4% in nsp5 (3C-like protease), 94.6% in nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), 99.8% in nsp13 (helicase), 99.2% in nsp14 (3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease), 99.4% in nsp15 (poly[U]-specific endoribonuclease), and 97.6% in nsp16 (2'-O-ribose methyltransferase). These nonstructural proteins are Coronaviridae-wide conserved domains in replicase polyprotein pp1ab. A threshold of >90% in aa sequence identity suggests that 2 viruses are of the same species; our findings suggest that the GDS04 strain belongs to the same species as HKU2.",
