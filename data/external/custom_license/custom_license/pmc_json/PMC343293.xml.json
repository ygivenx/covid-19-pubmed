On 16 November 2002, the first known case of SARS was discovered in Guangdong province in southern China. Since then the disease has spread rapidly along international air routes to other parts of the world. The number of reported SARS cases has increased exponentially, prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) to issue a global alert on 12 March 2003 [1-4]. A novel coronavirus is the causative agent of SARS [5].",

From geographic mapping to location-based alerting services, geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of global outbreaks like SARS. Carefully planned and designed maps are powerful decision support and spatio-temporal analysis tools. Web-based maps also allow for quick, frequent map updates based on the latest datasets, for interactivity to be incorporated into the maps (desktop GIS-like functionality, e.g., drill-down and zooming), and for wider and more rapid dissemination of information (compared to other publishing media). In this paper we have reviewed several geographic mapping efforts of SARS that we have found on the Internet. The maps described in this review employed a variety of techniques like choropleth rendering, graduated circles, graduated pie charts, buffering, thematic mapping, overlay analysis and animation to allow public health decision makers, travellers and local populations at risk to visually monitor and appreciate at a glance changes, trends and patterns buried in different online SARS datasets that were continuously varying with time during the 2003 outbreak. Some of the mapping services presented in this paper provided very detailed information down to individual street/building level (in Hong Kong). This kind of support is vital for improving global vigilance and awareness at all levels and for making well-informed decisions when designing and following up epidemic control strategies or issuing and updating travel advisories.",
