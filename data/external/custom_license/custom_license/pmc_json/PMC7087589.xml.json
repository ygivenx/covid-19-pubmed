In the more recent study by Rizzo et al. (2007) of thrombocytosis in 51 cats, it was found that reactive thrombocytosis occurred most commonly secondary to gastrointestinal, endocrine, cardiovascular, urinary, respiratory, hematological and musculoskeletal diseases. None of the diagnoses specifically mentioned feline parvovirus; however, there was a case of calicivirus in the latter study. Reactive thrombocytosis has also been reported in neoplasia and due to corticosteroid and antineoplastic drug use (Jain 1993).",

This cat was treated with interferon omega, which has been described as causing a mild and transient thrombocytopenia in clinical trials in cats (Information from European Medicines Agency Virbagen Omega Scientific Discussion 2009). The life span of platelets is 5\u201310 days and thus a decrease in platelet count to below normal levels would take longer to occur than neutropenia after a bone marrow insult (Stockham and Scott 2008). It is possible that a transient thrombocytopenia was present after day 0 but before day 10 as a result of the parvovirus and/or interferon omega, but as no blood sample was taken during this time, this cannot be proven. Theoretically decreased platelet numbers would have resulted in an increase in Tpo levels as explained in Figs. 3 and 4 and a rebound thrombocytosis. Platelet numbers can increase rapidly\u2014in a study concerning rats with induced thrombocytopenia, maximum rebound thrombocytosis (platelet count 1,720 \u00d7 109/L) occurred 4\u20135 days after the lowest platelet count (101 \u00d7 109/L) was recorded (Kimura et al. 1985). Data from a splenectomized dog with a normal platelet count (377 \u00d7 109/L) pre-splenectomy and a platelet count of 1,197 \u00d7 109/L 1 day and 1,395 \u00d7 109/L 5 days post-splenectomy indicate that platelet numbers can increase greatly in a very short time and that an increase from a theoretical thrombocytopenia in the first few days following day 0 to a platelet count of 3,448 \u00d7 109/L on day 10 is plausible (Jain 1993). However, it is probably unlikely that a thrombocytopenia alone would result in such high platelet numbers.",
