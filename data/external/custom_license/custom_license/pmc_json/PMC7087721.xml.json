Designed probe DNAs modified fluorescent dyes have been used mainly in homogeneous DNA sensing: molecular beacons (Tyagi et al. 1996), double-stranded probes (Li et al. 2002), excimer fluorescence (Masuko et al. 1998), light-up probe (Isacsson et al. 2000), fluorescent polymers (Ho et al. 2002), and DNAzymes (Wang et al. 2001; Stojanovic et al. 2001; Xiao et al. 2004; Tian et al. 2006). However, the use of enzymes can improve the sensitivity of detection since enzymes can amplify the detection signals through enzymatic reactions. At present, there are DNA sensing systems which use enzymes for homogeneous assays (Saghatelian et al. 2003; Pavlov et al. 2005); however, the inhibitors and probe DNAs must be covalently attached to the enzymes.",

The AES is an aptamer composed of an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer and a target-molecule-binding aptamer. Aptamers are nucleic acid ligands which can bind their target molecules with high affinity and specificity (Ellington et al. 1990; Tuerk et al. 1990). A target-molecule-binding aptamer was inserted into an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer to enable the change of the structure of an enzyme-inhibiting aptamer upon the recognition of the target molecule. Therefore the inhibitory activity of the AES was changed by binding to the target molecule, that is, we can detect the target molecule by measuring the corresponding enzymatic activity in a homogeneous solution.",

Moreover, we also have to consider the free energy of the folding of the enzyme-inhibiting aptamer. It is not easy to construct AESs which can detect various target DNAs with this design.",

Secondary structure predictions carried out using the mfold program (Zuker et al. 2003) yielded a number of possible structures for each AES invA, all of which may be present in solution. We classified the secondary AES structure into two states. One is the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure which bears the connected probe DNA at its end; the other is a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure disrupted by the hybridization of the connected probe DNA with the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer site. AES invA 5\u203236, 5\u203227, 5\u203218 and 3\u203227 (AES invA 5\u203236 is the thrombin-inhibiting aptamer which bears the 36-mer probe DNA at the 5\u2032 end; the other AESs were named in the same way) were predicted to fold into both of these two states. In contrast, AES invA 3\u203236 and 3\u203218 were predicted to fold into only one state, the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure. We assumed that the thrombin-inhibitory activity of AES invA 5\u203236, 5\u203227, 5\u203218 and 3\u203227 would decrease since the connected probe DNA would prevent the AESs from folding into the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure, and that their inhibitory activity would recover upon the hybridization of their target DNAs with the connected probe DNA site since the prevention of folding into the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure would be canceled. In contrast, the inhibitory activity of AES invA 3\u203236 and 3\u203218 would not decrease, since the probe DNAs would not prevent the AESs from folding into the native thrombin-inhibiting aptamer structure.",

The clotting time was saturated when AES invA 3\u203227 and its target DNA reached the same concentration. This result indicates that AESs bind to their target DNAs at a ratio of one to one, and that the dynamic range can be changed by changing the concentration of the AESs.",

In this study, we used a thrombin-inhibiting aptamer; however, the sensitivity of the sensing system can be improved if a more suitable enzyme-inhibiting aptamer is developed for this sensing system.AES does not require any modification. Although Saghatelian et al. (2003) and Pavlov et al. (2005) developed DNA sensing methods that use enzyme to detect the target DNA, these systems need to connect the probe DNA to the enzyme and the enzyme inhibitor. Enzyme modification usually results in significant loss of activity and requires a cumbersome process of enzyme preparation. In contrast, AES can be constructed very easily since AES is simply an oligonucleotide.\n",
