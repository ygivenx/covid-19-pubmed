A number of factors, including mutation and recombination, and the widespread use of live attenuated vaccines, play an important role in increasing the number of new genetic variants [3, 8, 15, 16, 28]. Recombination and mutation are two major forces in coronavirus evolution, and polymerase jumping during coinfection may promote recombination events between coronaviruses [22]. Molecular characterization using sequencing and phylogenetic analysis are effective methods for detection and characterization of recombination events among RNA viruses [29].",

In a study on the pathogenicity of Australian strains of IBV, a change was detected in the prevalence of IBV strains, from highly nephropathogenic strains in the 1960s and 1970s to strains predominantly pathogenic for the respiratory tract in the 1980s and early 1990s, indicating that IBV strains in Australia have undergone a significant change since 1962 [13].",

The novel IBVs are phylogenetically distant from the classical IBVs, and in fact, classical IBVs and turkey coronaviruses are more similar to each other than they are to the novel IBVs. Recently, the isolation of a new variant of IBV in Australia, from broiler farms located in New South Wales, that had low S1 gene identity to those of classical and novel IBVs but N gene and 3\u2032 untranslated region sequences similar to those of classical IBVs, suggested the emergence of a new subgroup of IBVs in Australia [14]. In this study, the new variant of IBV that circulated in NSW during 2002 and 2003 was further analysed by comparing the 3\u2032 terminal 7.2 kb of its genome (all the structural protein genes) with those of the other two IBV groups in Australia.",

Using Simplot, 456 informative sites were found that could support one of three possible trees. For almost 90% of the S gene (3 kb), 365 informative sites were found, and 84% of these informative sites supported a tree clustering N1/03 with the novel IBV strain N1/88. In contrast, only 8% of the informative sites supported each of the other two possible trees in this region (P < 0.0005). For the rest of sequences (3,000\u20137,200 bp), 95 informative sites were found, with 60% supporting the tree clustering N1/03 with VicS and only 14% supporting the tree clustering N1/03 with N1/88 (P < 0.05). This indicated that N1/03 clustered with the classical IBV strain VicS throughout the 3\u2032-terminal 4.2 kb of its genome and confirmed that a recombination event had occurred at the end of the S gene region (at around position 3000) and that N1/03 is a recombinant virus that emerged from recombination between these two groups of IBVs in Australia.",

The similarity of the N1/03 E, M and N genes to those of classical IBVs suggested that this isolate was closely related to the most commonly used Australian IBV vaccine strains. As these strains have been used for a long time in Australia, it is possible that they have contributed to the emergence of variant IBVs in the field. The S gene of N1/03 clustered more closely with the novel IBVs, and similarity plotting and bootscan analysis confirmed the close relationship between the S genes of N1/03 and the novel IBVs and suggested that the crossover event occurred near the 3\u2032 end of this gene.",
