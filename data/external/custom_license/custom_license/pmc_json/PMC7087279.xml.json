PEDV was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978 [22]. Since the first identification of PEDV, outbreaks of PEDV have been reported in many swine-producing countries, notably in Europe and Asia [23]. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PEDV, is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating enteric disease that is characterized by severe diarrhea, dehydration and a high mortality rate in swine, resulting in severe economic losses in the European and Asian swine industry [23].",

            "text": "One of the four CoV structural proteins, the E protein, is a small transmembrane protein of 76\u2013109 amino acids in length [3, 25]. The amino acid sequence of the E protein is quite divergent among different CoVs notwithstanding that its predicted structure is highly conserved [31]. The CoV E protein has a pivotal role in the assembly of virions, where it may induce membrane curvature or aid in membrane scission [3, 10, 11, 25]. Beyond assembly, the E protein has functions during infection, including in virus egress and in the host stress response [2, 4, 8, 17, 18, 26, 34]. In addition, the E protein has ion channel activity and interacts with host proteins [1, 21, 24, 29, 31\u201333]. In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, the deletion of the E protein modestly reduces its growth in vitro and in vivo [6, 7], resulting in an attenuated virus. In other CoVs, deletion of the E protein results in either the complete absence of infectious virus or a severe reduction in virus titer [12, 16, 18]. However, unlike other CoVs, in the case of PEDV, little is known about the functions of the E protein.",

In spite of using the vaccine strategy at present, damage caused by PEDV infection is continuous and serious in Korea. To better control and prevent PEDV infection, it is necessary to investigate the molecular epidemiology of PEDV field isolates in Korea. In this study, therefore, we investigate the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of the Korean PEDV field isolates and analyze the phylogenetic relationship of the Korean PEDV field isolates to other previously reported PEDV reference strains. In addition, we develop methods that can differentiate the attenuated DR13 strain, which has been used for manufacture of the most commonly used live oral PED vaccine in Korea, from all the other PEDVs.

These results are somewhat similar to those obtained in our previous study using the full-length M and ORF3 genes [20]. However, studies on the E gene of PEDV have almost never been reported although the E gene plays an important role in the biology of CoV, as described above, and to our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular epidemiological characterization of PEDVs using the E gene. Moreover, this study shows that although the E gene is smaller than the other structural genes, it is sufficient to produce meaningful insights into the epidemiology of PEDV in Korea, and additional studies on the E gene should increase our understanding of the genetic relationships among PEDVs from a wider range of countries, their diversity, and the global epidemic situation of PEDV.",

As the damage caused by PED has showed steady increase, PEDV vaccines have been developed and are commonly used in Korea. However, in spite of the use of the vaccine, damage caused by PED outbreaks is continuous and serious in Korean pig farms. Recent prevalent Korean PEDV field isolates analyzed in this study differ from members of the group including the vaccine strains, and therefore, this result raises questions about whether a new-type PEDV vaccine may be necessary for more effective prevention of PEDV infection. The second strategy is to prevent the spread of PEDV more effectively by rapid detection of PEDV when PED occurs.
