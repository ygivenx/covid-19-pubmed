Meanwhile, the use of mAbs to prevent or treat infectious disease has been much more limited1, with the notable exception of a mAb targeting the respiratory syncytial virus. In a recent study in Nature, Wrammert et al.2 describe a rapid route to obtain fully human, high-affinity mAbs to influenza virus. Taking advantage of a huge surge in actively transcribing plasma cells, the authors show how specific antibodies can be cloned from single cells following recent vaccination.",

Interestingly, the influenza-specific IgG+ ASC response (reaching 6% of total B cells on day 7) could be clearly distinguished from the influenza-specific IgG+ memory B cells that peaked later, at day 14 (averaging 1% of all B cells). The high frequency of ASCs in peripheral blood roughly 1 week after booster immunization has been consistently observed with various antigens, such as tetanus toxoid5. Indeed the first fully human mAbs from phage were generated from individuals boosted with tetanus toxoid, followed by library construction using peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated 7 days after boosting6,7.",

Of further interest is that the flu-specific antibodies had an unusually high rate of somatic mutation: half of the flu-specific ASCs had >20 somatic mutations, whereas only a quarter of the memory IgG+ B cells were mutated to this degree (the ratio of CDR/FWR mutations was \u223c2:1).",

In a screen against different influenza strains, most of the mAbs were found to have the highest affinity for the immunizing vaccine strain rather than for strains previously encountered by the host. This finding is at variance with a mechanism called original antigenic sin (OAS)9, in which the elicited antibodies show higher affinity to previously encountered influenza strains than to the vaccine strain. The results by Wrammert et al.2 rather support a mechanism whereby the ASCs with the highest affinity for antigen are preferentially expanded.",
