SARS-CoV was established\nas the causative agent of the fatal global outbreak of respiratory\ndisease in humans during 2002\u20132003 that resulted in a case-fatality\nrate (CFR) of 11%.1 In October 2012, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added SARS-CoV to\nthe select agents list of the Department of Health and Human Services\n(HHS). Among many aspects that make SARS-CoV a potential threat to\nthe human population, the lack of effective vaccines or anticoronaviral\ndrugs had a significant impact in its classification as a select agent.\nHowever, even with the most extensive preventive measures, the reemergence\nof SARS-CoV or other virulent human coronaviruses poses a continuing\nthreat. A powerful reminder of this, as well as of the fatal repercussions\nof the interspecies transmission potential of CoVs, was brought to\nthe forefront in September 2012 by the emergence of a new SARS-like\nrespiratory virus (previously termed HCoV-EMC, now designated Middle\nEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV).2,3 As\nin the case of SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV is likely of zoonotic origin4 and closely related to bat coronaviruses from\nthe Betacoronavirus genus (group 2).5 Reminiscent of the initial stages of SARS-CoV pandemic,\nglobal travel has contributed to the spread of MERS coronavirus, with\na total of 178 laboratory-confirmed cases and a CFR of 43%.6 The infected individuals display SARS-like symptoms,\nincluding a severe respiratory infection (SRI), and sometimes exhibit\nan acute renal failure which is a unique signature of MERS infection.2b,7 Today, a total of 6 human coronaviruses are known, of which SARS-CoV\nand MERS-CoV are recognized as highly pathogenic with the potential\nfor human-to-human transmission.8 Without\nan efficacious antiviral agent or vaccine, the prevention of current\nand emerging coronaviruses continues to rely strongly on public health\nmeasures to contain outbreaks. Therefore, research toward the development\nof anticoronaviral drugs continues to be of paramount importance.",

Toward this goal, we utilized our previous\nSAR analysis and the X-ray structure of compound 15g in\ncomplex with SARS-CoV PLpro to develop a second generation of PLpro\ninhibitors. Here, we disclose SAR of a new series of potent SARS-CoV\nPLpro inhibitors, their selectivity, antiviral efficacy, biological\nevaluation, and a detailed report of the molecular interactions between\nSARS-CoV PLpro and inhibitors 3k and 3j aided\nby X-ray crystallographic studies. Compound 3k was established\nto be the most potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor identified thus far\nin vitro. Furthermore, this compound displayed effective perturbation\nof SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells while displaying low cytotoxicity\nand high selectivity for SARS-CoV PLpro over human homologue enzymes.\nThe improved resolution of the SARS-CoV PLpro\u20133k and PLpro\u20133j X-ray structures revealed novel\nfactors accounting for the observed high binding affinities of the\npiperidine-containing compounds and the previously elusive molecular\ncontributions of the benzyl substituent of the carboxamide. Therefore,\nour data highlight 3k, as well as two slightly less potent\nbut more metabolically stable analogues 3e and 5c, as good candidates for advancing to preclinical evaluations.\nIn addition, we demonstrate the effective inhibition of PLP2 from\nHCoV-NL63, a potentially fatal pathogen in children and elderly, by\ncompound 3k and related analogues. Importantly, these\ncompounds may also present an opportunity for the development of broader-spectrum\nantiviral drugs against infections caused by both SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63.",

It evolved from\na small SAR study on the HTS hit 2 (Figure 1) and is therefore an attractive lead for the development\nof anti-SARS drug candidates.15 Compound 15g is composed of the central piperidine-4-carboxamide core\ndecorated with 1-naphthalenylethyl and 1,3-benzodioxolylmethyl substituents\nat the piperidinyl and carboxamide nitrogens, respectively.

X-ray crystallographic studies\nof the SARS-CoV PLpro\u201315g complex show that the\nmethyl group of the (R)-enantiomer extends into a\nsmall pocket that has both hydrophobic and polar features and is filled\nwith water molecules.

Addition of substituents to R1 resulted\nin higher IC50 values for all substitutions, and loss of\ninhibitory potency was proportional to substituent size. These trends\nindicate that the corresponding pocket might be less accessible than\npredicted by the crystal structure, with no clear opportunities for\nextra H-bonding or lipophilic interactions. It also appears that the\npotential entropic gain by displacing the water molecules with larger\nR1 groups is not achieved likely because of a larger enthalpic\npenalty of breaking the H-bonds formed between these water molecules\nand Asp165, Arg167, Tyr274, Thr302, and Asp303. As a result, unlike the previously\nreported predictions by fragment mapping program (FTMap) in which\nall water molecules were removed before computational analyses,20 here we demonstrate experimentally that this\npocket is unlikely to provide any extra ligand-binding sites or room\nfor larger substituents.",
