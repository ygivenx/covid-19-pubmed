The notifications of each infection were aggregated into weekly case counts. Numbers of positive influenza A and B test results for residents of Montr\u00e9al during the same period were provided by the Qu\u00e9bec Public Health Laboratory from a sentinel laboratory surveillance network database and were similarly aggregated into weekly influenza A or B counts. The number of hospital laboratories in the sentinel network varied from six in 1996 to seven in 2008, with a stable core of five laboratories throughout the study period. Testing practices changed after the introduction of commercial rapid tests in 1996 and after improvement in the access to antiviral drugs, contributing to an overall increase in the total number of positive results.",

(iii) All the long\u2010term\u2010trend terms are highly significant. (iv) Influenza B counts for a given week (week 0) are associated with increases in S. pyogenes notifications in the same week and in the following one (weeks 0 and +1), of about 3.8% [(1.0376\u22121)*100] and 3.5% [(1.0354\u22121)*100] per additional positive influenza B test, respectively.

These two phenomena together are suggestive of \u2018harvesting\u2019\n31\n, \n32\n: at least some of the S. pyogenes infections following influenza B would have occurred even without influenza, but a few weeks later, having merely been brought forward in time by influenza B. However, a model containing influenza B counts for all 6 weeks does not show a better fit than one containing only the counts for weeks 0 and \u22121 (deviance = 6.96, P = 0.1381), indicating that this apparent \u2018harvesting\u2019 of cases may well be in fact random variations in the parameters.

Looking back at the time series of influenza B counts (dark line in Figure 1), one notes that these were years with late, high peaks in the weekly numbers of influenza B\u2010positive tests. An additional indication that this association may be causal is that the average age of known influenza B cases in these 4 years is significantly higher, 33.9 years, than in other years, 24.6 years (P < 0.000), and closer to the average ages of S. pyogenes cases, 45.9 years.",

These findings confirm what has been observed in Figure 3. When long\u2010term trends but not seasonality are controlled for (models 3 and 4), influenza A and B counts significantly improve the model fit for both streptococcal infections, but the improvement is greater for S. pneumoniae than for S. pyogenes. When seasonality is also controlled for by dedicated terms, however, the only effect remaining is that of influenza B counts on S. pyogenes counts, as mentioned earlier (models 5 and 6). This effect remains essentially the same if one uses Poisson regression, includes earlier S. pyogenes counts in the model, splines with five or seven knots, or fewer harmonics for the periodic functions (results not shown).",

We submit that the associations that have resisted such control provide the clearest information about true effects, in the absence of data on specific confounders. This may be especially true if these associations can be attributed to particular deviations from the usual patterns, as observed in explaining the differences between 4, 5 by means of Figure 1. Our results illustrate that the opportunities provided by modelling aberrations are different from those provided by modelling regularities: in Table 2, had the observed seasonality of S. pyogenes always been that predicted by the seasonal trend terms, no IRR for influenza B would have emerged as significant.",
