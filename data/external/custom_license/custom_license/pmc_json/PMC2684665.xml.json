            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of acute respiratory tract illness globally [1], infecting both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues [2,3]. They cause more asthma [4-6] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [7] exacerbations than any other factor identified to date, in addition to the majority of cold and flu-like illnesses (CFLIs) [8]. It is interesting to note that, in contrast to many of the other well-known respiratory viruses, the clinical symptoms of HRV infection are primarily caused by the host's immune response to infection rather than by viral cytopathicity [9-12]. HRVs are the most common reason for prescribing antibiotics [1] and are associated with pneumonia [13], otitis media [14] and sinusitis [15]. Up to a quarter of children worldwide experience asthma symptoms, with prevalence plateauing in some countries while rising in other parts of the world [16]. In adults, COPD exacerbations are predicted to soon become the world's third leading cause of death [17]. The HRVs therefore create an enormous direct and indirect social and economic burden across the developed and developing world [18,19].",

The impracticality and insensitivity of these methods [22,23] resulted in the misconception that compared to influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, for example, HRVs had straightforward and relatively minor roles in illness. This thinking limited their further characterization. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods subsequently started to reveal the extent and complexity of HRV-induced illness [24] and have identified the frequent occurrence of co-detections, including some involving HRV strains, in respiratory specimens. Associations between an illness and a single respiratory virus, assumed because it was the only virus detected, now require re-examination to confirm that the association holds true. Previous concept-defining HRV-related epidemiology was conducted without knowledge of the numerous co-circulating respiratory viruses discovered since and was biased by the inability of culture to detect certain strains and species. Many of the 20th century's conclusions about HRVs will need to be revisited using modern methods. To date only one HRV strain, HRV-QPM, has been a deliberate target for intensive study using molecular tools [25].",

            "text": "Examination of the entire set of HRV coding and non-coding regions by Palmenberg et al. produced data that support recent reports of recombination among the HRVs [37], but other intensive analyses indicated that this is not a driving force behind HRV evolution [35,38,39]. The discrepancies may be due to the different numbers of classical strain sequences used in each study, the different origins of the viruses used for sequencing, or the way predictive algorithms were configured. The ability of HRVs to recombine in practice awaits empirical evidence. Fascinatingly, one of ten field strains (HRV-54f05) sequenced by Palmenberg et al. [20] was predicted to be involved in recombination events from which seven classical strains arose compared to only one event for the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) variant of the same strain. Previously, one strain needed to vary only at a few epitopes to be considered distinct from another. Now, when comparing molecular rather than antigenic differences, two variants of the same HRV strain (HRV-54) are found to differ across the genome by almost 600 nucleotides (91% identity, equating to 46 amino acid changes resulting in 98% amino acid identity). This raises several questions. How quickly does intra-strain genetic variation occur? Can such variation accumulate in sufficient quantity to require that a clinical HRV isolate or PCR detection be reconsidered as a distinct strain? Are new HRV strains actively emerging? These questions are especially important given the obvious impact of nucleotide sequence variation on evolutionary conclusions. Future studies may address the extent and location of genetic differences between clonal yet low-passage field strains [35] versus culture-adapted ATCC strains. Palmenberg et al. also proposed that a previously identified (HRV A' [40]), small but divergent clade within the HRV A species, which was renamed clade D, may represent a new species of HRV [20]. When aligned together, two of the three members of this clade (HRV-8 and HRV-95) differ by no more than 81 nucleotides (>98% identity) or ten amino acids (>99% identity) and should be recognized as a single strain, as has been noted [20,34]. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) set 70% amino acid identity in two key regions as part of the demarcation between species within the genus Enterovirus. The definition is met in the 2C+3CD genomic region for assigning clade D to a novel species, as it exhibits >89% average amino acid identity between the clade's two distinct members but only 65% identity to other HRV A strains. However, the clade remains similar enough to the other HRV A strains in the P1 region (>70% average identity), its choice of receptor (major group [41]) and its similar G+C content. Clade D's antiviral profile is more similar to the HRV B strains (antiviral group A). Other genetic findings from the report of Palmenberg et al. [20] build upon those described previously for the classical HRVs [35,36].",

However, the data do not directly contribute to more clinically relevant areas of research, such as diagnostic assay design, epidemiology, immunology, viral interference and co-infection, clinical impact, differential diagnosis and infection control. To address these areas is a daunting task because to be most informative, future respiratory virus studies, whether for HRVs or other viruses, should undertake an all-inclusive approach towards virus characterization. To give statistical power to the findings, large populations should be screened regularly regardless of symptoms (addressing persistence and pathogenicity), for all viruses (addressing co-infection and interference) across multiple years (addressing recurrence and seasonality) under case-controlled conditions. Ideally, hospital and community-based settings would be sampled in parallel (addressing pathogenicity in both groups), including the collection of appropriate material to permit serology and immunology investigations. These studies will need comprehensive and reliable molecular assays capable of detecting all instances of each virus or virus group and would benefit from an internationally collaborative approach.",

It is likely that our current PCR-based methods could identify more than 100 novel HRV strains, raising more questions. What drives the development of so many strains when compared to the small number of strains of other RNA virus species?

Clearly, serotyping is no longer best or even most frequent practice, but it is to be hoped that future studies can determine sequence regions that suitably replicate these subdivisions, avoiding costly, time-consuming and technically demanding complete genome sequencing. Currently, it is impractical for most diagnostic and many clinical research laboratories to routinely sequence the full genome of every HRV detected, a task made especially daunting by the high prevalence of these viruses. The 1D region is the best subgenomic target for enterotyping [44] and has previously proven suitable for rhinotyping. However, the extent to which intra-species recombination will render subgenomic regions unreliable indicators of strain identity is a new source of uncertainty. The use of capsid-derived subgenomic regions for speciation remains reliable. Regions with high inter-strain sequence homology, such as the 5'UTR, are understandably risky targets for strain or species typing. An agreed upon definition of what constitutes a distinct HRV strain would be helpful for future studies and may become available from the Picornaviridae Study Group [45] in due course. Once all HRVs are identified, we may reliably define associations between strains, clades or species and clinical illnesses and syndromes. Characterizing the full spectrum of HRVs, including full genome sequencing, will better inform our efforts to create reliable therapeutics, such as antivirals that reduce viral replication and the symptoms of illness. The scope of HRV antigenic diversity and the possible importance of frequent, mild HRV infections for the development of a robust antiviral immunity during the early years of life may mean that a sterilizing vaccine, if feasible, is not desirable.",
