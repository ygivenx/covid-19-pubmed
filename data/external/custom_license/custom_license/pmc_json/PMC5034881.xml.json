            "text": "Viral infection has affected human health throughout history. The difficult, long, and expensive race to bring new drugs to the market is further convoluted by the appearance of new viral diseases rapidly spreading around the world. Among the most recent emerging viral pathogens, chikungunya virus,1 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus,2 and Zika virus,3\u20135 to mention a few, are of great concern to the World Health Organization. For example, the recent spike in Zika virus infection in several states of Brazil has health officials scrambling to understand the specific aspects of this virus\u2019s pathogenicity.6\u20138 While vaccine development is under way and Zika\u2013dengue virus cross-reacting antibodies have been described,9\u201312 antibody-dependent enhancement will need to be addressed.13 Thus, as part of the efforts of the scientific community to alleviate the pain of existing and emerging epidemics, new and improved ways to study viral processes and understand the adverse effects on the host are in need. The intricate cross talk between virus and host is further evidenced by the inability of phenotypic-based approaches for antiviral discovery, at least at first, to identify the specific step or target affected. Focusing on discrete steps of the viral life cycle, from attachment and entry or decoating and replication of the viral genome to maturation or budding of infectious viral particles, facilitates a more pinpointed method to drug discovery. This approach can lead to targeted discovery if/when the specific drug target or viral/host process is known. Jonsson et al,14 for example, have utilized real-time PCR to identify the relationship between enteroviruses and host cell receptor binding, in an attempt to establish improved methods for understanding specific interactions between the virus and its host. Additionally, Lundin et al15 identified an inhibitor specifically targeting membrane-bound RNA synthesis in certain coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome. Each event in the life cycle can potentially serve as a target for antivirals when the basic mechanisms are understood or when the factors involved are known. Here, we focus on proteolysis, a critical step in the cross talk between virus and host with potential and yet unmet capabilities for drug discovery. Historically, the viral-encoded protease (when this exists) has been an obvious target for antivirals. The array of protease inhibitors (PIs) on the market against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease (for the sake of simplicity, only the HIV-1 protease will be referred to as PR)16 or more recently against hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease17,18 exemplifies this fact. However, proteolysis in the context of viral infection is a much more complex process, defined by the cleavage of both viral and host proteins by either the viral-encoded protease or host-encoded enzymes.19,20 Members of the Flaviviridae such as HCV and dengue virus (DenV) represent a good example. The viral proteome, which is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, is cleaved by the viral-encoded protease at sites facing the cytosol and by host peptidases, peptide peptidases, and protein convertases (mainly furin) in the membranous/luminal face.21\u201325 While the viral-encoded protease is the obvious target for the development of inhibitors, host-encoded proteases specifically acting on the viral proteome have not fully met their potential as candidates for the development of competitors.",

Furthermore, taking into consideration the specific location in the cell where each step occurs can enhance the power of targeted drug discovery that will ultimately lead to potent and efficient antivirals. This is particularly so with proteolysis, as proteolytic events occur in various subcellular compartments.26,27 Monitoring cleavage in these compartments should elucidate the cellular requirements for cleavage in a natural cellular milieu and facilitate the discovery of more biologically relevant specific antivirals, which would therefore be more effective. With this in mind, we have previously developed an assay that monitors the cleavage activity of the HIV-1 PR28 within the cytosolic environment as well as an assay that monitors the cleavage of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) gp120/gp41 boundary within the vesicles of the classical secretory pathway.29 Additionally, this assay was adapted to the premembrane protein of DenV, which is also cleaved in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network, and was used in a pilot screen30 to demonstrate the utility of the assay for drug discovery. Here, we have shown that by exploiting the power of genetic engineering through retroviral technology, we can combine more than one assay, increasing multiplexed capabilities to enhance drug discovery while keeping specificity.",

Constituted of the ER, Golgi, and trans-Golgi network, the classical secretory pathway houses a multitude of enzymes responsible for posttranslational modifications including signal peptidases and signal peptide peptidases that are responsible for cleaving off signal sequences for ER targeting,43,44 the clearing of misfolded proteins from the ER,45 and the maturation of certain viral proteins during infection, most notably HCV core protein.46,47 Additionally, a family of enzymes known as proprotein convertases are responsible for the removal of inhibitory domains, leading to the activation and maturation of certain proteins.48 HIV-1, for example, utilizes this pathway for the cleavage/maturation of its viral-encoded Env protein en route to the cell surface. Once translated, the Env glycoprotein gp160 is translocated to the ER where it is posttranslationally modified to its mature and active form by the prototypic proprotein convertase furin, a process absolutely required for the production of infectious virions.49\u201351 The Env subunits gp120 and gp41 are then transported to the cell surface where they remain noncovalently associated and are incorporated into budding viral particles.42",

Antibody staining allows for flexibility as one can use an array of fluorescently labeled antibodies (primary or secondary). We thus investigated the possibility of exploiting the distinct fluorescent features of the two assays to analyze them in combination.

It is thus critical that we first prove these assays can be expressed independently and then tested in conjunction, whether by mixing cells or in the same cell background. In order to do so, we first performed transfection experiments including all necessary elements of the assay and then proceeded to amplify selected sorted populations with the goal of obtaining stable cell lines expressing each engineered assay. We proceeded with the first assay for monitoring HIV-1 PR, which is much more complex than the second that monitors cleavage of HIV-1 Env as it relies on three plasmids rather than one (refer to \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section for details). Cells were induced with doxycycline (Dox) and analyzed for inhibition in the presence of the PI darunavir (DAR) as observed by the presence of eGFP-positive cells. As expected and shown in Figure 2, there is a drastic increase in eGFP-positive cells after several rounds of flow cytometry analysis, as compared to the original co-transfection experiments. This illustrates the usefulness and importance associated with engineering stably expressing cell lines, particularly when they are intended for further use in screening and/or multiplexed applications.",

Therefore, we proceeded to establish within the same cell the two biological systems we have previously developed in individual cells. For that purpose, a cell line expressing the assay for the HIV-1 PR, and thus all the elements necessary (the rtTA, the UAS-eGFP reporter, and the Gal4/PR fusion), was transduced with retroviral particles carrying the HIV-Env assay construct. Figure 5 depicts the flow cytometry analysis of cells that were genetically engineered to express both assays. The first panel in Figure 5A shows the negative controls (untreated and unstained, without or with Dox). Following induction with Dox and treatment with the PI DAR, a large percentage of cells turn positive for eGFP (green window). In order to prove that these cells carry the Env assay as well, the cells were stained with HA antibody and APC-coupled secondary antibody to corroborate that the scaffold protein traveled to the cell surface. When stained for HA-APC, a large percentage of cells turns positive for HA (red window). Importantly, a large percentage of the population turns positive for both eGFP and HA (double-positive population in the purple window) when cells are both stained for HA-APC and induced and treated with DAR. In order to further demonstrate that the Env assay monitors Env clevage in these cells, the cells were treated with the furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (DCK) and stained with FLAG and APC-coupled secondary antibody (Fig. 5B). A similar single-positive eGFP population (green window) appears in FLAG-APC-stained cells following Dox and DAR treatment. More importantly, a similar single-positive (red window) or double-positive population (purple window) appears following DCK treatment. This clearly demonstrates that these cells robustly express both assays simultaneously and can monitor PR activity, Env cleavage, or both. These results prove that each system can clearly and distinctly be monitored based on the treatment required for the detection of each.",

The assay that monitors cleavage of HIV-1 Env relies on fluorescently labeled antibody staining and thus can use any fluorescent channel distinguishable from the fluorescence channel of eGFP (FITC). Here, we have thus tested whether mixed cell populations harboring each respective assay could still distinctively display its specific phenotype, giving us the ability to monitor activities of multiple targets simultaneously. Analysis by flow cytometry clearly showed that the mixed populations of cells, tested following their individual treatment (induction with Dox and treatment with PI for the PR assay, and HA staining for the Env assay), did indeed display their appropriate phenotype (eGFP expression and HA surface expression, respectively). Our results clearly demonstrate that different biological systems can be combined, provided each system is robust enough and distinguishable from its counterpart and accurate readouts can be obtained from each respective assay.",
