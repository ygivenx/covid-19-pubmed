In some instances, we selected established primer sets; in others, we used a software program designed to cull sequence information from GenBank, perform multiple alignments, and maximize multiplex performance by selecting primers with uniform melting temperatures and minimal cross-hybridization potential (Table A1). Primers, synthesized with a 5\u00b4 C6 spacer and aminohexyl modification, were covalently conjugated by a photocleavable link to Masscode tags (Qiagen Masscode technology) (8,9). Masscode tags have a modular structure, including a tetrafluorophenyl ester for tag conjugation to primary amines; an o-nitrobenzyl photolabile linker for photoredox cleavage of the tag from the analyte; a mass spectrometry sensitivity enhancer, which improves the efficiency of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization of the cleaved tag; and a variable mass unit for variation of the cleaved tag mass (8,10\u201312). A library of 64 different tags has been established. Forward and reverse primers in individual primer sets are labeled with distinct molecular weight tags. Thus, amplification of a microbial gene target produces a dual signal that allows assessment of specificity.",

Assays were initially established by using plasmid standards diluted in 2.5-\u00b5g/mL human placenta DNA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and subjected to PCR amplification with a multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen), primers at 0.5 \u00b5mol/L each, and the following cycling protocol: an annealing step with a temperature reduction in 1\u00b0C increments from 65\u00b0C to 51\u00b0C during the first 15 cycles and then continuing with a cycling profile of 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 50\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s in an MJ PTC200 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA). Amplification products were separated from unused primers by using QIAquick 96 PCR purification cartridges (Qiagen, with modified binding and wash buffers). Masscode tags were decoupled from amplified products through UV light-induced photolysis in a flow cell and analyzed in a single quadrapole mass spectrometer using positive-mode atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A detection threshold of 100 DNA copies was determined for 19 of 22 cloned targets by using a 22-plex assay (Table 1).",

The advantage of Mass Tag PCR is its capacity for multiplex analysis. Although the use of degenerate primers (e.g., enteroviruses and adenoviruses, Table A1 and Table 1) may reduce sensitivity, the limit of multiplexing to detect specific targets will likely be defined by the maximal primer concentration that can be accommodated in a PCR mix. Analysis requires the purification of product from unincorporated primers and mass spectroscopy. Although these steps are now performed manually, and mass spectrometers are not yet widely distributed in clinical laboratories, the increasing popularity of mass spectrometry in biomedical sciences and the advent of smaller, lower-cost instruments could facilitate wider use and integrated instrumentation. In addition to developing additional pathogen panels, our continuing work is focused on optimizing multiplexing, sensitivity, and throughput. Potential applications include differential diagnosis of infectious diseases, blood product surveillance, forensic microbiology, and biodefense.",
