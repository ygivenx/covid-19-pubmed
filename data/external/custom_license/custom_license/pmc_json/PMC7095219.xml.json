We collected on admission and on daily basis at 8:00 a.m. information on arterial blood gases, serum creatinine and bilirubin concentration, blood platelet count, vasoactive drugs dosage, as well as development of bacterial pneumonia and requirement for RRT. Information was recorded daily until death, ICU discharge or day 28, whichever came first. Day 1 started at 8:00 a.m. on the first ICU day.",

Baseline serum creatinine values were estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, as recommended by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Working Group (assuming a lower limit of normal baseline glomerular filtration rate of 75 ml/min) and similar to previous studies [1\u20133].

In addition, this lack of information prevents us from speculating as to the causes of the development of late AKI. In addition, chronic renal failure, as self-reported or recorded in the patients\u2019 medical records, was an exclusion criterion. However, we could not determine whether elevated baseline serum creatinine was early AKI or rather indicated stable chronic renal failure.
