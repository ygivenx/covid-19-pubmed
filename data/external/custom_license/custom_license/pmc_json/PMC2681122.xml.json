These samples were collected as part of a previous study that tested for influenza viruses A and B, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, in addition to KIPyV and WUPyV (4).",

Quantitative real-time PCR was not performed because of limited applicability due to inherent variability in respiratory sample collection. The presence of MCPyV in samples positive by real-time PCR was then confirmed by using partial large T antigen (LT3) and major capsid protein (VP1) conventional MCPyV detection PCR assays of Feng et al. (3). All PCRs were performed in a unidirectional workflow through dedicated suites for reagent preparation, PCR setup, and amplification. Ten random real-time PCR\u2013negative samples, 10 water control samples, and template-negative control samples were used to exclude amplicon or sample cross-contamination. A clinical sample that was positive for MCPvV by all 3 assays and confirmed by sequencing was used as a positive control for all PCRs.",

Of these, 8 (1.5%) could be confirmed by only 1 conventional PCR, and 7 (1.3%) yielded positive results in all 3 MCPyV PCRs. All positive detections were in NPA samples. This variation in detection rates could have been due to the unforeseen nonspecificity of the real-time PCR, or to the inherent lower sensitivity of conventional PCRs, because most real-time PCR\u2013positive samples produced late signals at cycle threshold values \u224840. We chose a conservative algorithm, in which a sample must have been positive in all 3 assays to be considered a true positive.

These PyVs may be merely transmitted through the respiratory route or detected during periods of reactivation (9). Similarly, JC and BK PyVs are suspected of being transmitted by inhalation and are occasionally detected in respiratory samples, yet patients generally remain asymptomatic or exhibit nonspecific upper respiratory tract symptoms (10,11). Like these other PyVs, MCPyV may potentially be transmitted through the respiratory route and become latent in other sites, such as epidermal tissue, by systemic spread, in a similar fashion to murine PyV (12). Clearly, further studies using larger sample populations, expanded respiratory pathogen detection methods, and control groups are needed to elucidate what role, if any, MCPyV plays in upper and lower respiratory tract illness.",

Sequence data from positive specimens indicate that MCPyV found in respiratory secretions is similar to the viruses identified within Merkel cell carcinomas. Whether and how the virus is translated from the respiratory tract to skin cells, if it is able to be transported systemically, and its role in the malignant transformation of Merkel cells are all questions worthy of further investigation.",
