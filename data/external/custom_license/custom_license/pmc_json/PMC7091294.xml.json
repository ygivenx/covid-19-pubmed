            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) occur frequently in the society [1]. Especially children appear to be at risk. Most of the viruses are transmitted through respiratory droplets. While some of them can stay localized in the respiratory tract, some can show systemic dissemination. In two third of the ARTI, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial (RSV) virus, parainfluenzavirus, adenovirus, coronavirus and rhinovirus are responsible. Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants [2]. Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are mostly seen in the lower respiratory tract infections of the children after RSV infection. Type 3 is common and approximately half of the children are infected in the first year after the birth. Adenovirus infections are endemic and cause infections mostly in the school ages; 50 % of these infections are asymptomatic. Infections with coronavirus is seasonal and is especially seen in the winter months. The infection caused by rhinovirus is seen throughout the year [3]. Metapneumovirus infections, like RSV infections are common in children younger than 2 y [4]. RSV infections are among the most important agents causing acute bronchitis and pneumonia in Turkey as in the world. Almost all of the children younger than 3 y may be infected with RSV [5]. C. pneumoniae, is responsible for 10\u201320 % of community-acquired atypical pneumonia in the childhood, 10 % of the acute bronchitis and 5\u201310 % of the pharyngitis cases [6].",
