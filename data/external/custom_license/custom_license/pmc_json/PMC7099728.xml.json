            "text": "RNA interference is an endogenous cellular process for the inhibition of gene expression mediated by sequence-specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). This phenomenon was first observed in petunia flowers, and later reported in Caenorhabditis elegans.[12] These dsRNAs, 21\u201323 bp in length, are produced by cleavage of a long RNA duplex by Dicer, a ribonuclease III-type enzyme. When produced, the small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes can activate a process of degradation of mRNA transcripts containing target sequences. This process is driven by the siRNA-enzyme complex or RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and results in inhibition of gene expression. Interestingly, when dsRNAs are artificially generated either by direct chemical synthesis or by folding single RNA into short dsRNAs with a hairpin loop, they can target the specific mRNA sequences and induce degradation of the mRNA. Therefore, RNA interference can be a tool for down-regulation of gene expression in cultured cells as well as in living organisms.[13,14]",

To address the first issue, researchers have established two strategies. The first one is to chemically synthesize siRNA.[15] In this method, two single-stranded, complementary, short RNA oligonucleotides are synthesized. These two short oligonucleotides are then annealed into a dsRNA in a test tube. Usually short oligonucleotides (21\u201323 nucleotides) are designed with a two-nucleotide overhang to facilitate the activation of the RISC during the process of mRNA cleavage. In addition, a 3\u2032-hydroxyl group and a 5\u2032-phosphate group are generated to enhance the function of the siRNA duplex.[16] While it is simple and quick in its application, this chemical synthesis strategy has shown limitations in both stability and production cost of the siRNA.",

Since DNA plasmids can be easily and economically produced in Escherichia coli, this strategy has been widely adopted for the characterization of gene functions in vitro and for therapeutic studies.[14]",

Each of the methods has both advantages and disadvantages. Recently, numerous papers have reported siRNA technology as a potent tool to knock-down gene expression or its therapeutic potential for treatment of various human diseases ranging from cancers[18] to infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis).[14] In this review, we focus on the application of siRNA technology to SARS.

This group of researchers was the first to demonstrate that the siRNAs inhibited S gene expression and virus replication in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV strain BJ01. This study provided strong evidence that siRNAs targeting the S gene could be employed as potential tools to inhibit SARS-CoV replication.

Based on this finding, they reasoned that siRNAs targeting the leader sequence should effectively inhibit viral replication in cell culture systems, since they would target a number of proteins simultaneously. This research group provided evidence that siRNA targeting the leader sequence, via a U6 promoter-based vector, had a stronger effect on the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication than siRNAs targeting the S gene. Later, Ni et al.[28] selected three of 32 potential siRNA sequences targeting the leader sequence. They demonstrated that three siRNAs delivered in the pSilencer3.0-H1 vector dramatically inhibited SARS-CoV replication as measured by either plaque formation or levels of mRNAs and proteins (S and N). While another group did not find any significant inhibitory effect of the chemically synthesized siRNA duplex targeting the leader sequence,[27] Li et al.[24] and Ni et al.[28] have separately demonstrated the effectiveness of vector-driven siRNAs targeting the leader sequence. Whether there is a difference between the vector-driven and the chemically synthesized siRNAs remains unclear.",

However, in the only animal study to date, Li et al.[32] have reported their attempts at using siRNAs to inhibit SARS-CoV infection in Rhesus macaques. After initial screening, two chemically synthesized siRNAs were selected from 48 siRNAs based on the previous work of Zheng et al.[31] The researchers treated the animals with the two siRNA duplexes in a commonly used glucose solution D5W prior to, and after, infection with SARS-CoV and found that all of the monkeys in the treated groups showed less severe symptoms than those in the control groups. They reported that during a 20-day period of observation after the administration of the siRNA duplexes, the treated monkeys showed an average body temperature of <38.9\u00b0C, while the control animals had an average body temperature of >39.1\u00b0C. The temperature changes were correlated with the changes in lung histopathology. The intriguing observation was that three of the four animals in each of the three siRNA-treated groups were free of SARS-CoV in the oropharyngeal swab specimens, based on measurements of SARS-CoV RNA copy numbers. This indicated that the SARS-CoV particles released from the animals\u2019 lungs were dramatically reduced by the injection of the siRNA duplexes. Whether siRNA inhibited SARS-CoV replication or blocked the spread of the virus within the lungs remains to be determined. However, this study clearly demonstrated that siRNAs were effective both prophylactically and therapeutically with no adverse effects in the animal study.[10] The reduction of virus in the lungs may dramatically reduce spread to contacts, thereby being an effective approach to reducing spread of the virus between patients and caregivers.",

Since mutations of the SARS-CoV genome can occur,[36] which may result in viral escape from siRNA targeting,[40,41] He et al.[33] used a combination of different siRNAs targeting different sequences. This had a further beneficial effect since it appears that the combination of the different siRNAs had a synergistic effect on the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication.

Although viral vectors can be used to deliver siRNAs for SARS-CoV, potential adverse effects, such as inflammation, have to be considered. In fact, siRNAs can be used to down-regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. For example, Cao et al.[48] have shown that interleukin (IL)-8 expression can be down-regulated by an HDAd expressing an siRNA targeting IL-8 mRNA in airway epithelial cells. The concern of host immune responses to HDAd may be addressed by using anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, adeno-associated viral vectors that do not cause host immune responses have been shown to be highly efficient in expressing siRNA in mouse livers[43] and may be adapted to airway siRNA delivery as well.

For the rational design of siRNAs for treatment of SARS, we can also learn from experience with the application of siRNAs to other diseases. In this regard, Schiffelers and Storm[49] have reported a system named ICS-283, which was developed for systemic delivery of therapeutic siRNA to sites of pathological angiogenesis. In addition, Dykxhoorn and Leiberman[50] recently commented on different approaches for the intravenous delivery of siRNAs in clinical applications. With the improvement of siRNA design and delivery methods, RNA interference will offer another major weapon for combating dangerous infections by viruses, such as SARS-CoV.",
