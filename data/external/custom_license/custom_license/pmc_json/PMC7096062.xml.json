            "text": "Meanwhile, the method might have commercial applications. According to tenOever, the molecular biocontainment strategy has appealed to at least one vaccine manufacturer, which contacted him to see if putting a species-specific leash on H7N9 could bring down the biosecurity requirements for producing potential vaccines against bird flu. If lowering the risk of human infection also dropped manufacturing requirements from level 3 biosecurity to level 2, then vaccine production would be much less expensive.",

He worries, however, that some funding agencies might make the addition of microRNA sequences to viruses under study a prerequisite. \u201cI wouldn't want it [the technique] to be imposed on anyone, but it can be a safety precaution,\u201d tenOever says. \u201cFor the time being, there is no requirement to utilize this technique as a biocontainment method,\u201d says Amy Patterson, director of the Office of Science Policy at the US National Institutes of Health.",

For example, Richard Webby, an influenza researcher at St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, suggests that more work is needed to ensure that the modification doesn't weaken the strength of infectious agents in species that lack the complementary sequence. \u201cThis has to be checked in a number of different viruses and different species, because we've got to be confident there's no impact on the biology of a virus before we spend years doing studies with it,\u201d Webby says.",

But the specter of a viral escape isn't far from anyone's mind. \u201cHindsight doesn't really help if a virus jumps,\u201d Parrish says. \u201cWe still have to keep our guard up.\u201d",
