We reconstructed an overall phylogeny of lyssaviruses by using a Bayesian Inference with the first 405 nt of the N-gene and MrBayes version 3.1.2 (http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/). Two simultaneous runs of 106 generations were conducted, each with 4 Markov chains, and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The best-fit nucleotide model, GTR + I + G, available in MrBayes was selected according to the corrected Akaike information criterion. The phylogenetic reconstruction was based on a dataset representative of all known lyssaviruses, including the recently described IKOV. The topology obtained showed that this sequence is more closely related to IKOV and WCBV than to the lyssaviruses in phylogroups I and II (Figure). These results suggest that this sequence tentatively belongs to a new Lyssavirus species named after the location of collection, Lleida bat lyssavirus (LLEBV).",

However, recent molecular analyses have confirmed that the genus Miniopterus belongs to the family Miniopteridae (12). M. schreibersii bats are migratory, widely distributed across southern Europe and Eurasia. Large numbers (thousands) of these bats overwinter in caves and move in the spring to different and sometimes distant summer roosts for reproduction (13). These ecologic features make it relatively easy for an infectious agent to quickly spread out within and among the populations.",
