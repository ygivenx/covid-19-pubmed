The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) was adopted by WHO in 1977 against diphtheria, polio, tuberculosis, pertussis, measles, and tetanus with prime aim of immunization to all children [1]. It was started in India in 1978 with BCG, DPT (3 doses) and typhoid vaccine. In 1979, OPV and in 1985, measles vaccine was added to the list subsequent to omission of typhoid vaccine [2]. Later Hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) were included in the same. So far, vaccination has successfully eradicated small pox, polio and maternal and neonatal tetanus along with decreasing the burden of many other diseases.",

It is difficult for the parents to handover their child to the nurse knowing that the child does not understand why he is being hurt. It is a helpless feeling as the parents know that the discomfort and the side-effects far outweigh the morbidity and mortality due to the disease. The most common vaccine-related concern the parents have is that injection will be painful to the child. Study by Kennedy et al. demonstrated that 44.2% of parents are concerned about pain to the child [5]. Studies suggest nearly 24% of parents and 63% of children have needle fear and it is the primary reason for immunization non-compliance amongst 7% of parents and 8% children [6]. So being a pediatrician we must ensure vaccine delivery in a painless manner.",

To reduce pain at the time of injection, breastfeeding, administration of a sweet-tasting solution (sucrose), offering to rub or stroke the skin near the injection site with moderate intensity before and during vaccination, parent and clinician-led distraction, and use of topical anesthetics (lidocaine\u2013prilocaine 5% cream or patch, amethocaine 4% gel and liposomal lidocaine 4% cream) all have been tried [7]. Topical application of lidocaine-prilocaine cream is proven to be effective and does not interfere with immunogenicity of the vaccine. Parents have shown good acceptance towards it even though it is expensive and take 60 min to work [8, 9]. Distraction is defined as the use of strategies to take an individual\u2019s attention away from the procedure [7]. Its efficacy is variable. Music seems to reduce distress and pain during vaccinations in adolescents but not in younger children [9]. However, video distraction relieves anxiety before and after vaccinations but not the pain. Distraction by blowing a party blower and toys reduces vaccination pain in children. Party blower also aids in breathing techniques which also decreases the pain. Breastfeeding relieves the pain by sweet taste, distraction, suckling, and physical contact and the 24% oral sucrose solution too decreases the pain by releasing endogenous opioids and distraction [8]. Tactile stimulation in the form of pressure at the site reduces the pain or not, is controversial [7, 9, 10].",

This process is known as \u201ctransformation\u201d and the altered plants are called \u201ctransgenic plants\u201d. Thus, they are highly safe and cannot cause disease. It will be easy to administer them and they will have a low production cost. It eliminates need of fermentation and purification systems, sterile delivery and being heat stable does not require cold chain maintenance. It confers both mucosal (IgA) and systemic (IgG) immunity. Over past 5 y significant progress has been made in expressing vaccine antigens in edible leaves (especially lettuce) and processing them to achieve antigen stability and efficacy after prolonged storage at ambient temperatures [18]. They can be grown using local production facilities and are thus, cutting expensive manufacturing cost. And as there is no need of needles, it prevents infection.",

The potential of sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery is largely unexplored. They are superior to oral vaccination method where there is a risk of degradation by gastric enzymes. Similarly in skin vaccination method, impermeable thick keratinized stratum corneum acts as a physiological barrier and chemical disruption and/or microneedle penetration is required which is not so in sublingual and buccal vaccine delivery. Intranasal immunization also induces mucosal immunity but retrograde transport of antigen and/or adjuvant from vaccine formulations to the brain and other neural tissues, causes serious side-effects. This is in contrast to the sublingual route of delivery wherein no antigenic migration to the central nervous system occurs. Many laboratories have documented the efficacy of sublingual immunization in inducing adequate immune response in experimental animal systems using a variety of antigens, including soluble proteins, inert particulate antigens (killed viruses, virus-like particles, bacterial extracts) as well as live-attenuated viruses [20]. Researchers have successfully demonstrated protection against H. pylori [21], HPV16, HPV18, and HPV58 pseudoviruses [22] by sublingual vaccination in animals. The sublingual mucosa is a promising vaccine delivery route for other respiratory pathogens including influenza virus, Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus [23]. However in a clinical trial, where HPV vaccine was applied sublingually to humans, antibody titre were 1000-fold lower than in the intramuscular group. So researchers concluded that alternative delivery systems and adjuvants would be required to enhance and evaluate immune responses following sublingual immunization in humans [23]. It is an attractive option for vaccine delivery because it is efficient, accessible, and relatively clean.",

In addition, the extensive vascularization and thin epithelium in the alveolar lung tissue [26] facilitates efficient systemic delivery of antigens, thereby ensuring both local and systemic antibodies. The delivery of vaccines via these routes is recently emerging as an attractive alternative to injection. It is more potent and a practical way of inducing effective immunity against infectious diseases. It elicits rapid immune response, both locally and systemically. It is gaining advances in the future for being a self-administrative and non-invasive technique, thus causing little discomfort to the patients. Another advantage is that both liquid and dry powder formulations can be given, thus saving the cost spend in transportation via cold chain.",

Pulmonary vaccine formulations for Hepatitis B virus [33], Measles [34], Tuberculosis [35] and Yersinia pestis are in preclinical research phase. Measles vaccine, MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine, BCG vaccine, Influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Human Papilloma virus [36] are in clinical research phase.

Animal experiments have also demonstrated efficacy of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae aerosol vaccine [39]. Most of the successful clinical trials have been done using jet nebulizers but the need for a pressurized (clean) air system and stability concerns of aqueous vaccine formulations limits their applicability in mass vaccination programs. As production of powder formulations for pulmonary administration is a one-step process, it reduces the risks of contaminations and batch-to-batch differences, as well as production costs.

Jet injectors are needle-free devices that deliver a prescribed drug, vaccine, or compound intradermally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly via high pressure produced by either a carbon-dioxide-filled or nitrogen-filled cartridge or a spring [12]. Antigens delivered by jet injectors are dispersed more widely in the tissue because of high pressure of the fluid stream allowing for a larger contact volume between the vaccine antigen and immune cells. Several studies have shown that it elicits higher antibody titers and seroconversion rates than traditional needle and syringe [12]. Earlier, multiuse-nozzle jet injectors were used that delivered vaccine through the same fluid stream and nozzle to multiple patients. It was commonly used for vaccinating military personnel, and for other mass immunization campaigns. However, when the year 1985 witnessed an outbreak of hepatitis B infection due to contamination of the jet injector by body fluids, health authorities, including the Department of Defense and the World Health Organization, discontinued the use of multiuse-nozzle jet injectors.",
