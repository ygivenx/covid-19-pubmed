The two companies have filed for a preliminary injunction against Canadian generics firm Apotex after it decided to take its chances against losing the patent-infringement lawsuit surrounding the drug and began shipping generic clopidrogel to the US. The move follows the collapse of a 'reverse payment' agreement aimed at settling the lawsuit, which meant the case would go back to trial.",

Apotex had argued that the '265 patent, which is due to expire in 2011, is invalid because it is anticipated by a prior patent (US 4,529,596, now expired) claiming both enantiomers of clopidrogel bisulphate. Moreover, because the '265 patent only covers the (+) enantiomer, Apotex maintains that its product does not infringe the patent anyway.",

However, after concerns were raised by the regulators about the deal, a revised settlement was proposed. BMS and Sanofi-Aventis agreed that if Apotex launched its generic and the '265 patent was subsequently held to be valid and enforceable, then the companies would waive the triple damages they are entitled to and instead would limit damages to 50% of Apotex's net sales, or 40% if they were to launch their own authorized generic. The two companies also agreed to give Apotex 5 days working notice before filing for an injunction to stop drug shipments.",

However, on appeal, although the US Federal Circuit agreed with the district court's findings in the case of the '893 patent, which broadly covers atorvastatin, it found fault with the '995 patent, which relates to the calcium salt of atorvastatin.",

Pfizer's problem is that claim 6 of the '995 patent covers the 'hemicalcium salt of claim 2' but claim 2 only recites 'atorvastatin acid' and crucially omits mention of 'pharmaceutically acceptable salts' of atorvastatin acid, which are covered instead in claim 1. The appeals court argued that claim 6 could have been properly drafted either as dependent from claim 1 or in the form of an independent claim, but as written it failed to specify a further limitation of the subject matter because it fell completely outside the scope of claim 2.",
