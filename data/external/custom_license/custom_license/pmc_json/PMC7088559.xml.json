            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease and its etiological agent is known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2]. SARS-CoV, a novel human CoV (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus), is a large, enveloped, positive stranded RNA virus, and structurally similar to other coronaviruses. The human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were commonly found in upper respiratory tract infection. So far, little has been done about their immunogenicities and vaccines. The structural proteins of SARS-CoV include membrane glycoproteins S, M, E and nucleocapsid protein (N). Recently, some researches reported that the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV possessed neutralizing epitopes [3\u20136]. However, other reports showed that SARS-CoV M protein might elicit the specific antibody [7, 8] and M protein might be involved in virus assembly [9]. The exact function of M protein remains unknown.",

Many of these methods involve live viruses with high infectivity and mortality. Special facilities like the bio-safety level 3 laboratory are required. On the other hand, preparation of large amounts of recombinant SARS-CoV proteins with good immunogenicity and antigenicity as well as their specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) is very important for the usage of these diagnostic reagents and for evaluation of the safety effectiveness of vaccine. It has been established that M protein plays an important role in other coronaviruses\u2019 life cycle and inducing immunity [17\u201323]. Therefore, we hypothesize that in SARS-CoV, M protein may also have such functions and may be an attractive target for anti-SARS drug research, vaccine development and the establishment of a serological detection assay. To testify this hypothesis, in the present study, we identified a B-cell antigenic epitope at the N-terminus of SARS-CoV M protein, characterized a monoclonal antibody against the protein, and defined the MAb recognizing region.",

Ltd (Dalian, China) which includes two restriction enzyme sites of BamHI and XhoI on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end to facilitate directional cloning. The synthesized M gene fragment was digested by BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into pGEX-6P-l (Amersham) to create a GST fusion protein-expressing plasmid pSARS-M. E. coli DH5\u03b1 competent cells (Amersham) was transformed with the recombinant plasmid and clones were identified by restriction digestion and sequencing. The sequence was further analyzed by DNAMAN biological software. To generate two recombinants containing truncated M protein coding gene, PCR was performed using plasmid pSARS-M as a template with two sets of PCR primers. The sequences of the first set primer were: Forward 5\u2032-TCC AGG GGC CCC TGG GAT CCA TGG CAG-3\u2032, Reverse 5\u2032-CTG ACT CTC GAG TCA TAG GAA TAG GAA ACC-3\u2032, which were used to amplify the N-terminal 1\u201328 aa coding gene of M protein.

Mice received a final booster injection with 25 \u03bcg of antigen in 200 \u03bcl PBS to the intraperitoneal cavity 2 days prior to hybridoma fusion. Mice were sacrificed and their spleen cells were harvested. Mice S/P2.0 myeloma cells were in log-phase growth prior to fusion with spleen cells [25].

The procedures of ELISA assay were same as described above, except that the second antibody was a 1:2,000 dilution of HRP labeled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako, Denmark). Only the hybridoma, whose cultural supernatants could react with the M fusion protein, but not with GST, was regarded as positive clone. Positive clones were continually selected and subcloned by limiting dilution for at least three times until the positive rate reached 100%.

As shown in Fig. 2a, the human serum specifically recognized a 30 KDa protein in the purified supernatants from IPTG-induced BL21 transformed with the plasmid pSARS-M, whereas no immunoreactive protein band was seen in the purified supernatants from IPTG-induced BL21 transformed with the empty plasmid pGEX-6P-l (Fig. 2b). These results indicated that no antibodies against GST protein were present in SARS-CoV-positive human serum. To determine whether the cross antigens are present in M proteins between SARS-CoV and other animal coronaviruses, Western blot was also performed using the sera from IBV-infected chicken and TGEV-infected swine, respectively. The results demonstrated that both IBV and TGEV sera failed to react with this 30 KDa of protein (data not shown). Indirect ELISA assay was performed to examine whether the purified GST/SARS-M fusion protein could be used as an antigen to detect the SARS-CoV-positive human sera. The results indicated that the purified M fusion protein still reacted strongly with all four SARS-CoV-positive human sera even when the sera were diluted to 1:12,800 (Fig. 2b). Our data also showed that purified M fusion protein had no cross-reaction with the sera of healthy donors (Fig. 2b). In addition, to confirm that no antibodies against GST proteins were present in SARS-CoV-positive human sera, ELISA assays were performed using purified GST proteins as antigen to coat 96-well plates. It was showed that no statistical significances were found in OD values between SARS-CoV-positive human sera and healthy human sera (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the expressed GST/SARS-M fusion protein not only shows a good antigenic specificity and reactiongenicity, but also can serve as an ELISA antigen suitable for detection of SARS antibody.\n\n",

SARS-CoV N protein was found to be highly antigenic and contain many linear and conformational epitopes, which are consistent with results from investigations of other coronaviruses [8, 27, 28]. Moreover, in other coronavirus, the S1 domain of the major envelope spike protein was the most antigenic. For instance, several antigenic sites were found in the N-terminal S1 domain of TGV [29]. However, in SARS-CoV, the S2 region of the envelope spike protein was the B-cell epitope-rich region, indicating that it is an immunodominant site on the viral envelope comprising the spike, matrix, and small envelope glycoprotein [6]. With respect to the M protein in other animal coronaviruses, the M protein is abundant among the structural proteins and can induce antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus neutralization. It is also involved in the assembly and budding of virions together with the E protein [17\u201323]. These known key roles of the M protein make it an attractive target for the development of vaccines and drugs as well as for effective diagnostic reagents. However, SARS-CoV differs from other coronaviruses in nucleotide sequence, and the exact function of its M protein is still unknown.",

More recent report by Tripp et al. showed that two MAbs (292 and 283) against SARS-CoV M protein were developed and showed their reactivity with SARS-CoV in IFA and immunoprecipitation test. However, even when two MAbs were tested at a 1:80 dilutions for reactivity against SARS-CoV by ELISA, the positive-to-negative (P/N) ratios were no more than 3.7, implying their limiting usage as ELISA diagnostic reagent [33]. In the present study, we provided direct evidence that the MAb against M protein could be specifically reactive with the viral protein of SARS-CoV in ELISA even when it was diluted to 1:6,400.

Since outbreak of SARS in 2003, B-cell epitopes have been of particular interest to investigators who study the humoral response and design epitope-based vaccine to prevent potential antibody-mediated immunopathy [3, 4, 6]. Many of these studies focused on SARS-CoV S and N proteins. For example, by using phage-display library technique, Duan et al. has characterized a human single chain Fv (scFv), B1, which could recognize an epitope within amino acids 1023\u20131189 of S2 protein and has the potent neutralizing activities against infection by pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV S protein in vitro [34]. More recently, Hu et al. synthesized a 10-mer overlapping peptide library, which spanned the major structural proteins of SARS-CoV for screening and identification of linear B-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV. They demonstrated that five of assembled 22 longer peptides showed high cross-immunoreactivities to 42 SARS convalescent patients\u2019 sera from the severest epidemic regions of the China mainland. Among them, S471\u2013503, a peptide located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, could specifically block the binding between the RBD and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV entrance into host cells in vitro [35]. In current study, we demonstrated a linear B-cell antigenic epitope located in the M protein between 1 and 15 aa, which was consistent with the previous reports [7, 8]. Interestingly, when we searched for potential B-cell antigenic epitopes within the full-length M protein using Bioinformatics tools, we found that there were seven predicted antigenic epitopes within M protein (C. Lu, personal communication). Among them, the first epitope was just located at 8\u201336 aa of the M protein. Of course, our results did not eliminate the possibility that other potential B-cell antigenic epitope(s) may still locate in this region. While Hu et al. has identified the B-cell antigenic epitope on S2 protein, they also found that two synthesized overlapping peptides, both of which were located within amino acids 29\u201348 of M protein, could react to mixture of 42 SARS convalescent patients\u2019 sera, indicating that other potential B-cell antigenic epitope(s) may still locate in this region [35]. Meanwhile, our experiment showed that the recognizing region of the MAb against M fragment was in the M protein between amino acids 16 and 28. These data supported our primary hypothesis that the N-terminus of SARS-CoV M protein may play a critical role in induction of immune response, particularly in humoral immunity, in human and mouse.",

And we also experimentally identified one B-cell antigenic epitope and defined the MAb recognizing region in the M fragment. Our findings may shed light on the establishment of other valid and effective detection methods and development of epitope-based vaccine for SARS-CoV infection. Further studies are needed to better understand whether this B-cell antigenic epitope may induce neutralizing antibody in human body and to better evaluate the sensitivity of both M protein- and its MAb-based diagnostic method for SARS infection.",
