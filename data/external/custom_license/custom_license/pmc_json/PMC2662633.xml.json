This hospital specializes in the management of immunocompromised patients.

Specimens positive for KIPyV or WUPyV were tested for adenoviruses; human bocavirus; human rhinoviruses; human metapneumovirus; human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1; and human PyVs BK and JC by using PCR methods (6\u201311). Total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 \u00b5L of NA, BAL, or stool specimens by using the EasyMag System (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France). KIPyV was detected with an in-house real-time PCR assay targeting the VP1 gene. The primers and hydrolysis probe were designed by using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The final reaction volume was 25 \u00b5L and contained 12.5 pmol of SLKI-VP1s (5\u2032-GGAAATACAGCTGCTCAGGAT-3\u2032) and SLKI-VP1as (5\u2032-CTTTGATACTTGAACCGCTTTCCTT-3\u2032), 6.25 pmol of corresponding probe SLKI-VP1PR (5\u2032-6FAM-CGTGACCCCACCCCTCATTACTGGTC-TAMRA-3\u2032), 12.5 \u00b5L of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 5 \u00b5L of DNA extract. The reaction was run on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The specificity of positive specimens was confirmed by using PCR and nested PCR with primers POLVP1\u201339F/POLVP1\u2013363R and POLVP1\u2013118F/POLVP1\u2013324R, as described (1). The PCR products were then sequenced and compared with the previously described sequences from Sweden and Australia (GenBank accession nos. EF127906, EF127907, EF127908, EF520287, EF520288, and EF520289). WUPyV was detected by PCR as described (3). PCR products with the expected molecular weights were sequenced by using primers AG0044 and AG0045 and compared to published sequences (GenBank accession nos. EF444550, EF444551, EF444552, EF444553, and EF444554) (3).",

Results from previous reports suggest a similar frequency of both KIPyV and WUPyV infections being found in respiratory specimens, ranging from 1% to 3%. In contrast, in our series, we found a likely difference between the prevalence of KIPyV (8%) and WUPyV (1%), which suggests that the replication or reactivation of the 2 viruses in the respiratory tract may differ between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. However, this difference requires further investigation, in particular, by using similar real-time PCR assays. Notably, a significantly higher prevalence of KIPyV infection was found among HSCT patients, which suggests that a profound T-cell deficiency may be a factor in facilitating KIPyV replication.",

Some of the patients had only upper respiratory tract infections, notably sinusitis, whereas others had lung parenchyma abnormalities as defined by computed tomographic scan imaging.
