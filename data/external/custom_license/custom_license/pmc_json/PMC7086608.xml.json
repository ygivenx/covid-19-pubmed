Poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS), resulting from a coronavirus, was reported in 2006 [25]. Additionally, poult enteritis complex (PEC) has been associated with enteritis and growth rate reductions in commercial turkeys worldwide [4\u20136, 13\u201315, 19\u201321, 23, 24]. To date, turkey coronavirus (TCoV), turkey astroviruses 1 and 2 (TAstV-1 and TAstV-2), and turkey rotavirus (TRotV) have been described to be circulating among poult breeders in Brazil [3, 7, 9, 18]. In contrast, turkey reovirus (TReoV) had never been detected so far.",

ARVs have a segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome comprised of three large (L1-L3), three medium (M1-M3), and four small (S1-S4) genomic segments [10]. In turkeys, a group of TReoVs has been described that are genetically distinct, based on sequence analysis of their S3 genomic segments, from the other members of the genus Orthoreovirus [10]. These TReoVs were originally isolated from commercial turkey flocks, especially those in the southeastern United States, affected by PEC [8, 13\u201315, 19\u201321, 23, 24]. TReoVs can induce enteric disease and immunosuppression in turkeys; their pathogenicity is restricted to poults, however [19]. The aim of the present study was to isolate and molecularly characterize the first documented TReoV affecting immunosuppressed young poults in Brazil.",

The principal claim was related to low growth performance and weight losses. Samples were taken from individual houses containing approximately 4,000 birds each, and 14 % of the turkeys showed signs of deep depression but not of enteritis. Fifty samples from the bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus, and intestinal contents and tissues were collected and sent to the laboratory. The samples were divided evenly into two groups. In the first group, samples were fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for histology analysis. In the second, samples were frozen for virologic procedures.",

TReoV was isolated only from BF suspensions of affected poults. Three consecutive blind passages in semi-confluent Vero cell monolayers resulted in rounded floating cells, followed by the generation of some giant multinucleated cells via fusion (Fig. 1).\n",

Sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro, and genome annotation was done using SeqBuilder (DNASTAR, Inc., v. 8.0.2). Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal-W in MegAlign (DNASTAR, Inc.). A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on amino acid alignments using BLAST analysis (www.blast.ncib.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The positive amplified S3 segments obtained from the BF suspension were genetically identical to the TReoV isolated from the same biological source. A phylogenetic tree showed that the nucleotide sequence from the present analysis had 98 % similarity to TReoV TX99 and ATCC/VR-818, and 100 % to TReoV PEMS 85 and TX98 (Fig. 2).\n",

The IFA was conducted on BF sections in order to analyze their lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, and IgM+) as described previously [2]. Instead of using frozen sections, the IFA was performed with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded BF sections collected from field samples with BF sections from healthy poults as a control. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was conducted first using citrate buffer (pH 6.1) for 15 min at 700 W as a pre-treatment for reactivating viral antigens, which are normally damaged by formaldehyde fixation [2, 9]. Sections were then deparaffinized and rehydrated by washing with PBS containing 0.1 % Tween 80, and the slides were then boiled in water. Monoclonal antibodies against CD4+ and CD8+ (100 \u03bcL/slide; mouse anti-chicken CD4+ and CD8+ FITC, MCA2164F and MCA2166F, AbD serotec, Bio-Rad Company) and IgM+ (100 \u03bcL/slide anti-chicken IgM, Sigma-Aldrich) was applied overnight in the dark at room temperature in a 1:100 dilution in PBS with 5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA). The samples were washed as described previously [2], and rabbit anti-mouse conjugated to fluorescein (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to IgM+ sections. The samples were kept in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The images were collected under an AxioImager\u00ae A.1 light and an ultraviolet (UV) microscope connected to an AxioCam\u00aeMRc (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The images were processed using AxioVision\u00ae 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss) for each antigen, and values were determined by automatic counting of positive cells/mm2. For CD4+, CD8+ and IgM+ cells, significant differences between groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). All statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad\u00ae, CA, USA). Major histological damage was described as severe multifocal lymphoid follicle atrophy (data not shown) and was directly associated with a low number of CD4+, CD8+ and IgM+ lymphocyte cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A, B and C).\n",

This biological mechanism could explain, for instance, the lymphocyte depletion observed here, although lymphocytes are not considered a target for reovirus replication [11]. Importantly, the death of lymphocytes before two weeks of age can result in permanent immunosuppression [11]. The lack of inflammation in the BF and of histological changes in the thymus suggests that the infection observed in this study was in its initial phase. However, the observation of severe BF lesions and isolation of TReoV from these samples, along with the confirmation of TReoV in intestinal tissues and contents via PCR, means that these cases can be considered non-classical enteritis [1].",
