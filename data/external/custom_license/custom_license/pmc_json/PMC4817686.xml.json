Approximately 60%\u201380% of human EIDs originate from wildlife, as shown by the typical examples of hemorrhagic fever, avian influenza and henipavirus-related lethal neurologic and respiratory diseases that originated from rodents, wild birds and bats (Jones et al., 2008; Wolfe et al., 2007; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009; Marsh and Wang, 2012; Smith and Wang, 2013). The primary issues associated with the prevention and control of EIDs are how to quickly identify the pathogen, determine where it originated and control the chain of transmission. These issues, along with the limited knowledge of the viral population and ecological diversity of wildlife, complicate the study of EIDs. Therefore, meaningful information afforded by the understanding of the viral community present in wildlife, as well as the prevalence, genetic diversity and geographical distribution of these viruses, is very important for the prevention and control of wildlife-borne EIDs (Anthony et al., 2013; Daszak et al., 2000).",

They are natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and domestic animals, including henipaviruses, Marburg virus and Ebola virus (Luis et al., 2013; Quan et al., 2013; O'Shea et al., 2014). The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which resulted in nearly 8000 cases and 800 deaths worldwide, was suspected to have originated in bats and then spread to humans (Li et al., 2005). All of these examples reveal that zoonotic viruses carried by bats can be transmitted directly or via certain intermediate hosts from bats to humans or domestic animals with high virulence.",

In this study, bat individuals of 40 representative species across China were sampled by pharyngeal and anal swabbing, to assess the variety of viruses residing in bat species. Metagenomic analysis was then conducted to screen the viromes of these samples. Here we outline the viral spectrum within these bat samples and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of these novel bat viruses. The identification of novel bat viruses in this study also provides genetic evidence for cross-species transmission between bats or between bats and other mammals. These data offer new clues for tracing the sources of important viral pathogens such as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV).",

Samples from the same bat species and from the same site were then pooled. The pooled samples were processed with a viral particle-protected nucleic acid purification method and then amplified by sequence-independent reverse transcriptase-PCR as described previously (Wu et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014). Briefly, the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant from each sample was filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), to remove eukaryotic and bacterial-sized particles. The filtered samples were then centrifuged at 100 000 g for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C. The pellets were re-suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution. To remove naked DNA and RNA, the re-suspended pellet was digested in a cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes, including 14 U of Turbo DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), 20 U of benzonase (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), and 20 U of RNase One (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h in 1 \u00d7 DNase buffer (Ambion). The viral nucleic acids were then isolated using a QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Viral first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the primer K-8N (5\u2032-GACCATCTAGCGACCTCCAC\u2013NNNNNNNN-3\u2032) and a Superscript III system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To convert first-strand cDNA into double-stranded DNA, the cDNA was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of 5 U of Klenow fragment (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) in 1 \u00d7 NEB buffer 2 (final volume of 25 \u03bcl). Sequence-independent PCR amplification was conducted using 1 \u03bcM primer K (5\u2032-GACCATCTAGCGACCTCCAC-3\u2032) and 0.5 U Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A DNA smear of larger than 500 bp was excised and extracted with a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen).",

The raw sequence reads were filtered using previously described criteria (Wu et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2011), to obtain valid sequences. Each read was evaluated for viral origin by conducting alignments with the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide (nt) database (NT) and protein database (NR) using BLASTn and BLASTx (with parameters -e 1e-5 \u2013F T). Reads with no hits in NT or NR were further assembled using the Velvet software (v1.2.10, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and the contigs were again aligned with NT and NR to identify any viruses that were present. The taxonomies of the aligned reads with the best BLAST scores (E-value <10\u22125) from all lanes were parsed and exported with MEGAN 4\u2013MetaGenome Analyzer (Wu et al., 2012). Besides the alignment-first analytical strategy, we also tested assembly-first strategy to analyze the sequence data. The reads were firstly assembled by metagenomics assemblers (for example, MetaVelvet and IDBA-UD) (Namiki et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2012) and the output contigs were then aligned to NT and NR. As the percentage of viral reads was small in the whole data sets and most of the assembled contigs were thus of bacterial and host origins, the assembly-first strategy generally had lower sensitivity than the alignment-first strategy in this study.",

Thirty-four novel bat CVs (BtCVs) were identified in 13 bat species from 16 provinces (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S1). The genome sizes of these viruses varied from 1643 to 2979 nts. Seven new clades of BtCVs in the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus were found. Clade 2 was formed by two viruses clustered in a sister relationship with two pathogenic viruses, porcine and dog CVs (Chae, 2005; Li et al., 2013), at the same root with a short branch length. Three BtCVs were closely related to human cycloviruses. Seven BtCVs were assigned to the proposed genus Cyclovirus and formed four separate clades, three of which were closely related to human cycloviruses. A separate clade, clade 7, was constructed from two BtCVs and was closely related to the genus Cyclovirus. In addition to these viruses, 17 novel BtCVs branched out of the root of CVs and cycloviruses revealed the presence of new genera different from the known genera (Figure 4a).",

BtHp-PV/GD2012, in the genus Parvovirus, was very closely related to a recently identified rat PV, with 89% aa identity (Figure 4b). The aa identities among the predicted VP1 proteins of these BtPVs and bat bocaviruses, and other known members of the subfamily Parvovirinae, are shown in Supplementary Table S8.

Except for a few viruses, such as BtCalVs, BtCVs and BtPVs, which are closely related to known viruses, most of the bat viruses identified here that were widely distributed among the bat species were novel and showed no strict geographical restrictions. Large numbers of viruses were identified from bats of Rhinolophus spp. (viruses from 16 families were identified), Miniopterus spp. (viruses from 10 families were identified) and Myotis spp. (viruses from 13 families were identified). These findings reveal that these three bat genera may act as major reservoirs for diverse mammalian viruses in China. Notably, all bats collected in this study were considered to be apparently healthy and showed no overt signs of disease, further confirming that bats can tolerate diverse viruses through their unique metabolic and immune systems (O'Shea et al., 2014).",

The diverse BtCoVs were grouped into several novel evolutionary clades that significantly differed from those of all known \u03b1- and \u03b2-CoVs, providing additional evidence to support investigations of the evolution of bat-originated CoVs. With regard to BtParaVs, a previous study has revealed that bats host major mammalian ParaVs in the genera Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus and the subfamily Pneumovirinae (Drexler et al., 2012). However, in this study, except for 2 viruses assigned to the genus Rubulavirus, the remaining 12 viruses formed a new genus distant from the known genera and the 14 identified BtParaVs showed no direct relationship with the known human or animal pathogens of the family Paramyxoviridae. These results suggest an entirely different distribution of BtParaVs in China than previously reported. Although the classifications of bat herpesviruses, bat papillomaviruses, bat retroviruses, bat astroviruses, bat adenoviruses, BtPicoVs, BtCVs, BtPVs and bat bocaviruses were extended according to the current virus taxonomy file released by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the large number of novel viruses grouped into the various evolutionary clades identified in this study further expand the taxa to include many new viral genera and species. Many new clades formed by BtCVs distinct from all known members of the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus could be candidates for many new genera. Viruses related to henipaviruses, Ebola virus, rabies virus and pathogenic bunyaviruses were not detected in the Chinese bat species examined in this study.",

These phenomena indicate that certain bat-originated DNA and RNA viruses have the potential for intra- or cross-species transmission concomitant with the migration, co-roosting and intra- or inter-species contact of their bat hosts. The identification of some viruses, such as certain rat PV-related BtPV, norovirus-related BtCalVs, human or swine CV-related BtCVs and bat rotavirus in the rotavirus A group, also provides a new understanding of the evolution of these viruses in different mammalian hosts and possible transmission events that occur between bats and other hosts. Furthermore, BtCoVs had more distinctive features than the other bat viruses. Highly diverse S genes or ORF8s were present in particular CoVs carried by bats of the same species from different locations or even the same gathering place. Considering the diversity of CoVs, co-infections may create opportunities for recombination and the emergence of new CoVs that are able to adapt to new hosts. These findings may explain why tracing the potential CoV-related EIDs in insectivorous bats is often complicated by the presence of diverse key genomic segments and no virus with an identical genome sequence related to the pathogens causing human or animal EIDs has been identified in insectivorous bats. Instead, the origin of the Ebola virus and henipaviruses could be relatively easily confirmed by the identification of identical viruses in frugivorous bats (Calisher et al., 2006; Leroy et al., 2005; Smith and Wang, 2013).",

Recently, a functionally similar S gene has been identified in SL-CoVs of R. sinicus and R. affinis (WIV1, Rs3367 and LYRa11) with less sequence identity to the S gene of SARS-CoV, but which is capable of using the human ACE2 as a receptor for virus entry (Ge et al., 2013; He et al., 2014). However, knowledge gaps exist between bat SL-CoVs and SARS-CoVs with regard to the S gene and the unique structural ORF that prevent the determination of which bat virus species is the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV. In this study, two BtCoVs (BtRs-betaCoV/YN2013 and BtRs-betaCoV/GX2013) in Chinese horseshoe bats (R. sinicus) provided bat-originated unique structural ORFs that were nearly identical to the original SARS-CoV isolated during the earliest phase of the SARS pandemic (after transmission to humans, this region of SARS-CoV experiences ongoing adaptive evolution in humans, with gradual deletion (2004)), providing some information to fill the knowledge gap with regard to the origin of human SARS-CoVs. In addition, the higher similarities of the backbones of these two BtCoVs to SARS-CoVs, and the highly diverse S genes present in only R. sinicus imply that frequent recombination events occur among SL-CoVs of R. sinicus and other hosts, suggesting that the transmission of SL-CoVs from R. sinicus to other mammals is a result of the viruses obtaining novel S genes. These data indicate that human SARS-CoVs most likely originated through zoonotic transfer, either directly or indirectly, from Chinese horseshoe bats via a complicated adaptation process and a series of rare recombination events.",

The data obtained here and a recently reported lineage-C BtCoV, NeoCoV, identified by another group (Corman et al., 2014a; Yang et al., 2014a) provide new clues about the sources and pathways of human- and camel-derived MERS-CoVs in bats of the family Vespertilionidae. Bat species of this family may have important roles in MERS-CoV evolution (Yang et al., 2014b). Furthermore, the diverse S genes of these MERS-related CoVs may provide an opportunity for their recombination to ultimately generate new CoVs.",
