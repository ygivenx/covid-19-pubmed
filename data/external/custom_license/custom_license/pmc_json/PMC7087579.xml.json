            "text": "Synthetic oligonucleotides and their analogs have attracted considerable interest because of their potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications [1\u20135]. The natural oligonucleotides, however, are usually degraded relatively easily by cellular nucleases and cannot be used directly as therapeutics. It is therefore a challenge to develop modified antisense oligonucleotides that are degradation resistant, and can hybridize selectively to target nucleic acids with strong affinity. Over the past decades, a large number of oligonucleotides with modifications in the phosphodiester, sugar, or nucleobase have been prepared. Among them, phosphorothioate, which is the first generation of antisense compounds, shows increased resistance to degradation both in vitro and in vivo, [6\u20139] and one drug has been admitted to market by the FDA, which represents a first indication of the feasibility of the therapeutic antisense concept. Meanwhile, many antisense phosphorothioates are in phase I/II clinical trials [10, 11]. However, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides often show decreased specificity and affinity to the target sequences [12] and inefficient cellular uptake. Thus, other analogs, such as phosphoramidates [13], PNA [14], LNA [15], \u03b1-L-LNA [16], HNA [17], ANA [18], CAN [19], CeNA [20] and INA [21] have been studied systematically. They have proved to be capable of hybridizing with complementary DNA or RNA with increased thermal stabilities compared to the parent DNA:DNA or DNA:RNA duplexes and can be valid candidates for clinical applications.",

Isonucleosides are a new class of nucleoside analogues in which the nucleobase is linked to various positions of ribose other than C1'. Previous research has shown that a single isonucleotide-incorporated oligonucleotide antagonized the enzymatic hydrolysis of snake-venom phosphodiesterase strongly, although the binding ability of the modified sequence to the complementary sequence was slightly decreased, which indicated that there was a possibility to design a stable antisense oligonucleotide by incorporating isonucleotides in the sequence [26]. For the detailed understanding of structural information of isonucleoside-modified antisense oligonucleotides, an 18-mer of the antisense sequence 5'- AACATCTCCTGAGGGAAC -3' incorporated with isonucleosides A\n1 (6'-OH free) or A\n2 (6'-OH protected by allyl group), which was complementary to the mRNA region encoding spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (22,398\u201322,415 bp) has been studied by detailed unrestrained molecular dynamics in aqueous solution (Fig. 1). The results, which agree with the experimental data, provide an insight into the local and global structural features of the duplexes containing A\n1 and A\n2. The structural and energetic analysis from the MD simulations provides some information for further research and development of isonucleotide-incorporated antisense oligonucleotides.\n\n",

At first, the water box and counterions were subjected to a series of equilibration MD runs while holding the DNA fixed [30, 31]. The equilibration runs began with 1,000 steps of minimization with a large constraint of 500 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22122 on the DNA atoms and were followed by 25 ps of MD, reducing the constraints to 100 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22122, during which the temperature was slowly raised from 100 to 300 K over 1 ps and was maintained at 300 K for the remaining 24 ps. The size of the box was allowed to change until the water density and pressure converged to the correct values. Subsequent equilibration steps, during which position constraints on the DNA molecules were gradually relaxed, as well as the final production runs, were done by using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method to calculate electrostatic interactions [32, 33]. First, another 25 ps of MD were performed while still holding the DNA fixed to relax the solvent molecules fully and to complete the density equilibration. This was followed by a second set of 1,000 steps of minimization and 3 ps of MD, which were carried out with constraints on the DNA molecules of 25 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22122. Finally, five rounds of 600 steps of energy minimization were performed, in which positional constraints were reduced to 5.0 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22122 in each round.",

The total free energy can be estimated from the molecular mechanical energy, the solvation free energy, as well as the solute entropies for a series of snapshots and then averaging the results. The binding free energies of all double strands were investigated using the single-trajectory approach. Single-trajectory results mean that the thermodynamics data are extracted from a single trajectory of the complex. The assumption here is that the natural DNA, the isonucleoside-incorporated DNA, and the complementary DNA conformations are the same in the double strand and in the dissociated form and thus the vibrational, rotational, and translational entropy contributions can be neglected. Estimation of binding free energies in this manner has proven successful previously [36, 37, 39]. The binding free energy (\u0394G\nbinding) between the two complementary strands is calculated as the difference between the electrostatic interaction energies, van der Waals interaction energies, the solvation free energies, as well as the entropies of the double strands and the dissociated system:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta G^{\\text{binding}}  = \\Delta E^{\\text{elec}}  + \\Delta E^{\\text{vdw}}  - T\\Delta S + \\Delta G_{\\left( {\\text{double}\\,\\text{strand}} \\right)}^{\\text{solv}}  - \\Delta G_{\\left( {\\text{DNA}} \\right)}^{\\text{solv}}  - \\Delta G_{\\left( {\\text{complementary}\\,\\text{DNA}} \\right)}^{\\text{solv}} $$\\end{document}\n",

Therefore, only conformations generated during the last 800 ps period of simulations were used to monitor the structure properties. The comparison of the time evolution of the RMSDs showed that the duplexes of S2:S and S4:S were more difficult to achieve conformational equilibrium than the other ones.

Wherever the isonucleoside A\n1 or A\n2 was located at the 3'-end or in the center of the sequence, the slide and rise values of the A\n2 base pair steps was larger than those of the A\n1 ones. The A\n1-T20/A16-T21 (29.1\u00b0) or A\n2-T20/A16-T21 (21.2\u00b0) base pair steps in the S1:S or S2:S duplexes, respectively, showed larger roll values than in the S0:S duplex. In the S3:S and S4:S duplexes, the isonucleosides A\n1 and A\n2 induced changes in the roll of the steps below and above but not in the steps connected by A\n1 and A\n2 themselves. As shown in Fig. 3, the twist angles of S0:S, S2:S, and S3:S did not show obvious changes along the sequence. However, for S1:S and S4:S duplexes, significant differences were observed in the twist values. The lowest twist angle was found for the A\n1-T20/A16-T21 step (12.5\u00b0) in S1:S structure at this base pair step. And the C6-G31/T5-A30, T10-A27/C9-G26 and G13-C24/A\n2-T23 steps in the S4:S structure also showed small twist values lower than 20\u00b0. These small twist values were an indicator of untwisting of the DNA helix at the corresponding sites. Such small twist values for the G13-C24/A\n2-T23 step might be caused by the incorporation of isonucleoside A\n2, but we need much more studies to understand why the T10-A27/C9-G26 and G13-C24/A\n2-T23 steps also show so small twist values.",

The binding free energy of S1:S (\u221221.5 kcal mol\u22121) is close to that of the S2:S (\u221221.6 kcal mol\u22121). Those of S3:S (\u221215.9 kcal mol\u22121) and S4:S (\u221215.7 kcal mol\u22121) agree similarly. However, the incorporation of A\n1 and A\n2 modifications at the 3'-end of the strand (duplexes S1:S and S2:S) create lower binding free energies by 5.6 and 5.9 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, compared to the duplexes with isonucleosides in the center of the sequence (duplexes S3:S and S4:S). UV thermal stability measurements [26] show that the oligonucleotide consisting of isonucleoside A\n1 or A\n2 decreases the affinity for the complementary DNA. A\n2-containing oligonucleotides do not show obvious affinity differences to the complementary DNA compared to corresponding A\n1-containing sequences. However, the duplex in which A\n1 (A\n2) is at the 3'-end of the sequence has higher thermal stability than the duplex in which A\n1 (A\n2) is in the center of the sequence.
