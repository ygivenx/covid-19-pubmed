About COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report [2] has clearly mentioned the following (U.S. Feb. 24, 2020):Person-to-person spread of COVID-19 appears to occur mainly by respiratory transmission. How easily the virus is transmitted between persons is currently unclear. Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath [3]. Based on the incubation period of illness for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses, as well as observational data from reports of travel-related COVID-19, CDC estimates that symptoms of COVID-19 occur within 2\u201314 days after exposure.",

Similarly, there are 7382 confirmed cases (248 deaths) in Republic of Korea, and U.S. is no exception (see Fig. 1). Based on the confirmed cases, fatality rate, as of today, is still less than other respiratory diseases: study of 72,000 COVID-19 patients finds 2.3% death rate [5]. Figure 2 provides confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the world. Considering its global coverage, the WHO has already been declared public health emergency and its possible global threats, including consequences [6].

However, the fundamental theory behind AI-driven tools is that they require sufficient training data (of all possible cases). Often, traditional machine learning requires a clean set of annotated data so that classifiers can possibly be well trained, which falls under scope of supervised learning. Over the past 5 decades or more, tremendous progress has been made in resolving many issues of several different projects. However, we failed to reach the point: \u201cto model an accurate classifier, how big the size of training samples should be?\u201d Do we still wait for collecting fairly large amount of data? Deep Learning (DL), as an example, requires a large amount of data to be trained [14, 15]. The primary idea behind the use of DL is not only to avoid feature engineering but also to extract tiny features in radiology data (pixel-level nodule, for example) [16].",

            "text": "As compared to passive learning (traditional machine learning classifiers), active learning is used to a learning problem, where the learner has some role in determining on what data it will be trained [13]. When it is an emergency (COVID-19) [6], it requires a special attention so that data analysis and decision-making can be made consistently without waiting several days, months, and years for data collection. Again, exploiting real-time data (on-the-fly) is the must since one cannot wait for years to train machine and learn from them nor manual annotation/analysis is possible. This means that instead of having a conventional set of train, validation, and test set, we need AI-driven tools that can learn over time without having complete knowledge about the data, which we call Active Learning (AL). In other words, AL mechanism helps self-learn i.e., Incremental Learning (IL) over time in the presence of experts (if required) [18]. The ILs aim is to iteratively help learn model to adapt to new data without forgetting its existing limited knowledge. Figure 3 provides a schematic diagram of an AL mechanism, where different data types are used. While learning, the changes in data over time can be assessed with the help of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques. In AL-based tool, AD helps find/identify rare items, events or observations that bring suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data or with respect to a set of normal data for that particular event.",

Decisions that are solely based on one data type (regardless of the data size) may be skewed away from the severity of coronavirus influence. In such a case, use of mutitudinal and multimodal data can help support decision-making process with higher confidence. Since coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry, the most popularly used data for AI-driven tools mostly employ RNA sequences. Besides, Electronic Health Record (EHRs), Computerized Tomography (CT) scans [19\u201321], Chest X-rays (CRRs, see Fig. 4), and other data are considered and tested. Alibaba launched a new AI-based system to detect coronavirus infection via CT scans with an accuracy of up to 96% [19]. As mentioned before, AD in image consists in finding portion of the images (a set of pixels) with anomalous and unusual patterns. With small changes in image pixels, spatio-temporal signatures can be deviated from standard threshold(s). Since AD is not just limited to image data; it can be applied for all types of data that are ranging from a vector (1D array/signal/pattern), 2D matrix (image, for instance) to multi-dimensional data. In the recently reported work [20], Chest CT (see Fig. 5, as an example) \u2013 which is used to diagnose COVID-19 \u2013 can be complemented to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. Therefore, instead of using different machine learning models for one data type (and even small size data [22]) and looking for ensemble techniques to combine results, for AI researchers, it is wise to use mutitudinal and multimodal data to check whether different data types can help yield consistent decisions about the coronavirus outbreak over time.",
