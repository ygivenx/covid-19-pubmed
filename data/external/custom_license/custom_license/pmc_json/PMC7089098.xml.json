            "text": "Griffithsin, a high-mannose-specific lectin from Griffithsia spp. marine red algae [1], has broad-spectrum antiviral activity [2]. Griffithsin is the most potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agent described to date, with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) in the low picomolar range [3]. Moreover, Griffithsin exerts antiviral activity against multiple enveloped viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) [4], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [6], herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) [7] and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [8, 9], and at least one non-enveloped virus (human papilloma virus) [10]. Griffithsin showed a favorable safety profile, with no T-cell activating activity and little impact on cytokine and chemokine release by immune cells [11], as well as an excellent stability over a broad range of pHs, temperatures and protease exposures [12, 13]. All of these characteristics make Griffithsin an attractive candidate for development as an antiviral therapeutic, but its activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) remains unexplored.",

The Griffithsin gene (GenBank: FJ594069) was codon-optimized for E. coli expression, synthesized and cloned into the pUC57 vector by GenScript (Nanjing, China). Then recombinant Griffithsin gene was introduced into pET32a vector to obtain the recombinant expression plasmid pET32a-Griffithsin. Then the plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells to obtain the recombinant E. coli BL21 pET32a-Griffithsin strain which was selected by ampicillin and chloramphenicol, meanwhile pET32a was as a negative control. The recombinant E. coli strains were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C in LB broth. Then the overnight cultures were 100-fold diluted in 400 mL of fresh LB broth at 37 \u00b0C and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After further incubation for 24 h at 15 \u00b0C, the protein Griffithsin was extracted and purified using a 5 mL Ni2+-Sepharose HisTrap HP\u2122 affinity column (GE Healthcare, Sweden) elution with 300 mM imidazole in PBS. The protein was dialyzed to remove imidazole, following by endotoxin removal using ToxinEraser\u2122 Endotoxin Removal Kit (GenScript, China) and filter sterilization, then quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce, USA).

Furthermore, 4 \u00b5g/mL Griffithsin reduced PEDV infection of Vero cells by 69.2%; by contrast, the same concentration reduced infection by 76.9% when Marc-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at a MOI of five in our previous study. Griffithsin also displayed antiviral activity against other enveloped viruses to various degrees and had much more potent activity against HIV compared with the results shown here for PEDV [2]. The reasons underlying this difference are not completely understood, but the following potential causes may provide part of the explanation. Firstly, the structure and composition of glycans, as well as the glycosylation level of envelope glycoproteins, may affect the binding affinity of Griffithsin which is a major determinant of its antiviral activity. Secondly, the density of envelope spikes may be an important factor in determining Griffithsin activity. HIV-1 virions have an average of 14 spikes per virion particle [21] (compared with 450 for influenza type A virus [22]) and as few as four spikes are sufficient for HIV infection [23]; thus, to block infection by one HIV virion, Griffithsin must neutralize only four spikes. This probably explains why Griffithsin displayed a stronger inhibitory effect on HIV infection compared with other enveloped viruses.",

Moreover, studies have shown that the inhibition of MERS-CoV by Griffithsin might result from a failure of the virus to attach to target cells [5]. By contrast, Nixon reported that Griffithsin inhibited HSV-2 infection by disrupting cell-to-cell spread, not by acting on the entry stage [7].

Interestingly, Barry and his colleagues [24] indicated that SARS-CoV-infected mice treated with Griffithsin did not lose weight and had 100% survival; however, mice not treated with Griffithsin experienced a 25% decrease in weight and had just a 30% survival rate. Moreover, bioavailability studies [26, 27] in animals demonstrated that Griffithsin could accumulate to high levels in serum after subcutaneous delivery and that serum from Griffithsin-treated animals retained antiviral activity; these findings suggested that Griffithsin may be a promising candidate as a systemic antiviral therapeutic. Further studies in live animals will be necessary to confirm the value of inhibiting PEDV infection in vivo, potentially leading to a new antiviral intervention.",

Moreover, our study revealed that Griffithsin exhibited a stronger effect on PEDV infection when it was added during early stages of infection. Further studies in live animals will be necessary to develop a novel antiviral strategy for PEDV therapy.",
