            "text": "Viral infections are a subject of considerable interest, especially in the human, animal and plant health fields. Because there are still many diseases with no efficient treatment available, the search for new strategies is extremely important. Development of these agents are also important to overcome the frequent occurrence of micro-organisms resistant to drugs (Lohner and Staudegger 2001). Therefore, new therapies for human viral diseases strongly rely on the discovery of new therapeutic agents (Kao et al. 2010). For influenza treatment, for example, there are four antiviral agents approved and currently in use. However, Kao and coworkers (2010) already reported that H1N1 could easily develop resistance to Tamiflu, based on gene sequencing and structure prediction of neuraminidase. Zanamivir is an agent which also belongs to the neuraminidase inhibitor class and it is active against influenza A and B. The drugs amantadine and rimantadine belong to the adamantane class known as being effective only against influenza A virus (Fiore et al. 2011). Antiviral activity is also described in many bioproducts which are investigated for new drug development. These products can be produced by animals, plants or bacteria. Nowadays, development of new therapies for important diseases such as AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome) and those caused by new strains of viruses (SARS Coronavirus, Influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1) is a major topic (Delcroix and Riley 2011; Heinen and da Veiga 2011).",

The fact that these organisms are found inhabiting all the planet ecosystems, leads to believe that they have developed protection mechanisms to survive in these places. Susceptible to a variety of viral infections, insect resistance mechanisms are at present little known. Identification of these pathways stimulates the search for new agents which can be applied to human infections (Chernysh et al. 2002; Yao et al. 2006). Antiviral activity molecules are found in different compounds and insect species (Chernysh et al. 2002; Cueto et al. 2011; Ourth 2004; Popham et al. 2004). A recently identified protein (AVLO) of approximately 20 kDa, purified from the hemolymph of Lonomia obliqua is able of inhibiting the replication of measles, polio and influenza viruses when added to the cell cultures 1 h before infection (Greco et al. 2009). It was observed in this study that the hemolymph does not show any virucidal effect, suggesting that it may act at different stages of virus replication.",

The cells pre-treated with recombinant 10 and 23 showed a 1.000.000\u00d7 decrease in herpes virus titers in comparison to those in the control culture (cells without any treatment). Experiments carried out with the rubella virus showed similar results: the use of clone 16 caused a 10.0009 decrease in rubella virus titers. In summary, results from CPE reduction assay demonstrated that total hemolymph exhibited antiviral effects when it was added in pre-, post-infection and even simultaneously with the virus. The inhibitory effects of the total hemolymph were more powerful than when recombinants were tested. To identify any inhibitory effect of hemolymph on rubella and herpes replication, the viral genomic synthesis of rubella and herpes was compared between hemolymph treated and untreated infected cells. Total RNA and DNA extraction was performed after 96 h of rubella and herpes infection, and the intracellular viral load for both viruses were measured. Standard curves for the amplification were generated by a serial tenfold dilution of the template to evaluate the efficiencies of both reactions. The resulting standard curves showed that the amplification efficiencies for the genes were between 95 and 100 % with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. The results of the qPCR showed a significantly increase in level of rubella and herpes transcription in the inoculated cells at 4 days after viral infection compared to the mock. Also, a reduction of rubella virus was observed in cells treated with rAVLO clone 16 and total hemolymph in dilutions of 10\u22124, 10\u22125, 10\u22126, 10\u22127, 10\u22128 (Fig. 1).

            "text": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a very common human pathogenic virus. Clinically, HSV infection may give rise to gingivostomatitis, cold sore, keratitis, encephalitis, and genital herpes. HSV-1 and HSV-2 use several glycoprotein receptor complexes when they enter into the host cells. Both genotypes express the glycoproteins gB, gC, gD, geH and gL. All except gC are essential for viral entry, although the absence of gC does reduce efficiency. gC makes the first contact with the host cell, binding to heparin sulfate (HS) proteoglycans on the cell surface (Bernard et al. 2007). The herpes simplex virus can enter cells by two pathways: fusion of the envelope with the plasma membrane and by endocytosis. The first one is dependent on the interaction with specific receptors on the cell surface. The second is an auxiliary pathway which involves endocytosis of the envelope capsid and receptor-dependent fusion of the envelope with the membrane of the endocytic vesicle. Both pathways require initially, reversible attachment to the cell surface (Bernard et al. 2007). This first step in entry involves the binding of virion gC and gB proteins to cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAG). The importance of this step can be demonstrated by observation that enzymatic removal of GAGs results in 10\u201320 fold decrease in efficiency of plaque formation. In this study, we found that hemolymph exhibits selective inhibitory effect against HSV-1. Four probable pathways might be deduced to their antiviral effects: (Abernathy et al. 2009) blockage of viral binding to the cell receptors; (O\u2019Neill et al. 2003) attenuation of viral replication after entry; (Emery et al. 2004) inhibition of virus release from host cells and (Read and Kurtz 1999) reduction of the inflammatory cytokines \u201cstorm\u201d induced by the virus infection. Our results showed the antiviral effects with pre-incubation treatment presented CPE reduction assay with higher inhibitory activity than the simultaneous treatment for recombinant or total hemolymph. Moreover, to corroborate the antiviral activity, a qPCR assay was used to test the in vitro effect of the hemolymph on viral replication (Fig. 2). Olicard et al. (2005) showed that the addition of the hemolymph of C. gigas to Vero cell cultures prior to infection with HSV-1 did not affect subsequent infection. Thus, the inhibitory action of the hemolymph on viral replication may be through the activation the IFN pathways. Recently, Melchjorsen et al. (2009) showed the initial response of the cells infected by HSV is secretion of antiviral substances, such as defensins and nitric oxid and, most importantly, the production of cytokines, including IFNs and chemokines. The type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1\u03b2) are key cytokines produced during the very first hours after HSV infection. In vivo studies show that IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 alone controls early HSV infection independently of natural killer (NK) cells and lymphocyte activity (Bernard et al. 2007). Therefore, although studies have established an important role for IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 in antiviral defense, it is difficult to determine whether IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 contribution to viral clearance is primarily mediated by direct antiviral mechanism or by indirect immunoregulatory mechanisms. In addition, IFN\u03bb induces an antiviral state in cells through the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription-, the JAK/STAT pathway (Kotenko 2011; Sheppard et al. 2003). During early HSV infection, activation of multiple cellular transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, MAPK and IRF is also coordinated (Melchjorsen et al. 2009). Although some therapeutic and diagnostic improvements for control of HSV have been developed during the last years, the virus is by no means under control. The outcome of HSV infections is dependent on the balance between virus propagation and an effective immune response. Appropriate expression of IFNs, cytokines and chemokines is essential for efficient host defense against infection. Maybe, the mechanism of hemolymph includes induction of IFN \u03b1\u03b2 expression. Currently, we are studying this suggested hypothesis.",

Rubella can also induce damage by apoptosis. In vitro studies suggest that this effect is due to a rubella-induced caspase-dependent mechanism. Details of this mechanism are still unclear, but it seems to be dependent on virus replication started within 12 h of infection. The p53 pathway seems not be involved. However, in non-human cells, although viral replication is required to induce apoptosis, it is the non-infected neighboring cells that undergo this effect. In addition, the IFN \u03b1 and \u03b3 restrict viral replication, reducing the levels of viral RNA in the cell and inhibiting viral translation. Interestingly, Stanwick and Hallum (1974) found that other cells persistently infected with RUBV [BSC1, BHK (hamster; these cells lack the type I IFN receptor), RK13 (rabbit), and HeLa (human)] were not cured by similar levels of exogenously IFN administration. In conclusion, RUBV persistent infection in cell culture is surprisingly resistant to IFN treatment, likely contributing to the ability of RUBV to establish a persistent infection. Rubella transcription level was also affected by the presence of total hemolymph and rAVLO clones (Fig. 1).",
