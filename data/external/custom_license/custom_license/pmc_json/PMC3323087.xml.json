Stool specimens were homogenized with water and sieved through cheesecloth. Since Cyclospora oocysts must form sporocysts outside the human host before becoming infectious, the filtrate was resuspended in potassium dichromate (2.5%) and shaken for about 3 weeks at room temperature to induce sporulation. After sporulation (67%\u201394% of oocysts sporulated), samples were stored at room temperature until further processing (2\u20133 months).

Serum specimens from the donors of Cyclospora-positive stools were tested for serum markers of HIV, HAV, Hepatitis B virus, and Taenia solium. If serum from a Cyclospora-positive stool donor tested positive for any of the above, oocysts from that person were not used. Candidate inocula in which none of these pathogens or toxins were found were used in the human challenge study. This safety-testing protocol was reviewed and approved by both the University of North Carolina School of Medicine IRB and the CDC IRB. Cell culture infectivity assays and animal models were not available to determine the infectivity or viability of the oocysts. Attempts were made to assess the viability of the inoculum by observing sporozoite motility after excystation of the oocysts by different methods. However, these methods did not yield a sufficient number of motile sporozoites to measure viability.",

Persons affected in foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in North America were mostly adults who experienced prolonged symptomatic gastroenteritis, and median food-specific attack rates were high (6,7). In this study, only healthy adult volunteers (22\u201353 years of age) were recruited from areas in which cyclosporiasis is not known to be endemic.

Nucleotide sequence variability in the first internal transcribed spacer regions within C. cayetanensis from different geographic origins has been observed and suggests the existence of multiple strains (8,9). In addition, data from Cryptosporidium human volunteer studies demonstrated that the 50% infectious dose (ID50) differed (from 9 to 1,042 oocysts), depending on the isolate used in the study (10). For these reasons, we attempted to vary the inocula by selecting oocysts from persons in different geographic regions (Haiti, Missouri, and Georgia) and increasing the numbers of oocysts ingested by volunteers (from <1,000 oocysts to approximately 49,000) during the course of this study. Thus, differences in virulence characteristics of C. cayetanensis isolates appear not to have been a major factor in failing to establish infection.",
