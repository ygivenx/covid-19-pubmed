            "text": "The extracellular guanyl-preferring ribonuclease (RNase) Binase from non-pathogenic bacteria Bacillus pumilus is a well-studied enzyme, which has shown various biological activities in cell cultures [1]. Binase is a thermostable enzyme and does not require any co-factors or metal ions for its enzymatic action. Binase is able to enter into the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm and nucleus in 1 and 3 hours after its addition to cell culture media, respectively, and no intracellular Binase degradation by protease was detected during 48 h [2]. Media concentrations of Binase below 300 \u03bcg/ml are non-toxic for a variety of tested cell lines [2, 3]. The enzyme lacks superantigen properties to induce the polyclonal T-cell immune response [4]. Antiviral activity of Binase was demonstrated in animal models against negative-stranded RNA viruses, such as rabies virus and influenza A and B viruses [5\u20137]. Previously, we have reported antiviral properties of Binase against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in human cell culture [3, 7]. Also, antiviral action of Binase against the positive stranded foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) has been reported. It was demonstrated that the effect of Binase on the viral RNA of FMDV was three times higher than its effect on cellular RNA [5].",

            "text": "MERS-CoV and HCoV-229 are common viruses causing respiratory illnesses. Both are targeted using different antiviral tools. However, no antiviral agents are absolutely successful against all types of corona viruses, especially against MERS-CoV. As a result, several outbreaks occurred which led to a massive loss of human lives in different Middle East countries and South Korea during the last years [8]. Still, there is no vaccine or specific treatment currently available to prevent MERS-CoV infection. In this case, the well-known antiviral agent Binase can provide a new antiviral strategy against corona viruses. Based on the previously reported antiviral properties of Binase, we analyzed the effect of Binase on the replication of the alpha-coronavirus HCoV-229E and the beta-coronavirus MERS-CoV in hepatoma cell line Huh7 and primary MRC5. HCoV-229E causes self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold, while MERS-CoV is associated with high case fatality rates and is considered by the global health community to be a potential pandemic agent, since person-to-person transmission can occur and effective therapeutic options are limited [8]. Our data provides further insight into the mode of action exerted by Binase against positive-stranded RNA viruses and could support the development of novel antiviral approaches against CoV including MERS-CoV.",

Bacteria were grown in the complex phosphate deficient medium containing 2.0 % low phosphate peptone, 1.0 % glucose, 1.0 % CaCl2, 0.03 % MgSO4 \u00d7 7H2O, 0.3 % NaCl, 0.01 % MnSO4, pH 8.5 at 37 \u00b0C until the end of bacterial exponential phase. After pelleting bacteria cells using a benchtop microcentrifuge at 6000\u00d7g for 30 min, the supernatant was acidified by glacial acetic acid to pH 5.0, diluted five times with deionized water and applied on the column with DE-32 cellulose (Whatman, UK), and equilibrated with 10 mM Na acetate buffer (pH 5.0) to escape the negatively charged enzyme. The flow through from DE-32 was transferred to column packed with phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman, UK) and equilibrated with 10 mM Na acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Then, the column was equilibrated with 20 mM Na phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Binase was eluted with 200 mM Na phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Further polishing purification of Binase was performed using the MonoS HR 10/10 column (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) equilibrated with 20 mM Na acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and then eluted using a linear gradient of 0\u20130.25 M NaCl. The protein samples were lyophilized using the FreeZone 2.5 Liter Freeze Dry System (Labconco, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Homogeneity of the purified Binase was checked using the PAAG electrophoresis, Western blotting, and MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry on UltrafleXtreme (Bruker Corporation, Germany) as described in [10].",

Therefore, Binase was 107-fold more effective against HCoV-229E in Huh7 cells than in primary MRC5 cells. As the EC50 of Binase against MERS-CoV was 2 \u03bcg/ml in infected MRC5 cells (37 \u00b0C), Binase was found to be 22-fold more effective against MERS-CoV than against HCoV-229E in the MRC5 cell culture (Fig. 1e, f). Concerning the fact that Binase was non-toxic up to 500 \u03bcg/ml, the selectivity index (SI: CC50/EC50) is at least 1250, 11,6, and 250 for HCoV-229E-infected Huh7 cells (33 \u00b0C), HCoV-229E-infected MRC5 cells (33 \u00b0C), and MERS-CoV-infected MRC5 cells (37 \u00b0C), respectively.",

The quantitative analysis of the Nothern blot results showed the decrease of all corona viral subgenomic mRNAs by 86.0 \u00b1 0.8 % and 97 \u00b1 1.3 % upon 1 and 10 \u03bcg/ml Binase treatment, respectively, as compared to the subgenomic mRNAs level in virus-infected Binase-non-treated cells which was taken as 100 %. The corona viral structural N and non-structural nsp13 protein levels in the cytoplasm of HCoV-229E-infected Huh7 cells were analyzed by Western Blot (Fig. 2b). It was detected that Binase reduced the level of viral N protein by 43.3 \u00b1 5.5 % (10 \u03bcg/ml Binase) and 1.5 \u00b1 1.1 % (1 \u03bcg/ml Binase). It also decreased the level of nsp13 protein by 51.5 \u00b1 3.4 % (10 \u03bcg/ml Binase) and 21.4 \u00b1 3.1 % (1 \u03bcg/ml Binase). The amount of the cellular housekeeping protein actin was not affected by the Binase concentration to a similar extent. These results indicate that incubation of CoV-infected cells with media containing Binase at non-toxic concentration leads to a strong reduction of intra-cellular viral subgenomic RNAs, which is likely to contribute to the reduction in the amount of viral proteins. The finding that this reduction of the different subgenomic RNAs is much stronger than the reduction of the viral proteins might be due to the fact that the effect of the Binase treatment was determined 24 h p.i.. As several proteins can be translated from one mRNA, it can be imagined that a certain amount of viral proteins to be produced before the less stable subgenomic RNAs is reduced to the extent as detected after 24 h p.i.. The more stable proteins remain and can be therefore detected at the time point of investigation. The prominent effect of the Binase treatment on the viral RNAs in the HCoV-229E-infected Huh7 cells, including the full length genomic RNA, coincides with a strong reduction in the virus titer.\n",

The reduction of RTCs is in line with the data obtained from the Western blot analysis and is reflected by the decreased virus titers. Nevertheless, the effect of Binase treatment on the subgenomic RNAs (Fig. 2a) is much stronger than that on the dsRNA and nsp8 detected by immunofluorescence. Notably, the RTCs are anchored inside double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) [14, 15]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that in contrast to the subgenomic RNAs, which were also found in the cytoplasm [16], the dsRNA is partially protected from the effect of the Binase treatment.",
