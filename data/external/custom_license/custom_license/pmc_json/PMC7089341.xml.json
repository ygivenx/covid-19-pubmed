In recent years, accidents produced by the hazardous contaminant leakage and epidemics of the infectious diseases, such as SARS and influenza in indoor environment, have caused heavy damages and been paid more and more attention (Olsen et al. 2003; Li et al. 2007; Liu and You 2012). It is of great importance to locate rapidly the location of contaminant source in order to take effective measures and protect occupants.",

The multi-zone model was used to calculate the airflow and contaminant transport. This method only provides the macroscopic information about contaminant transport; however, it is difficult to find out the exact source location and intensity (Cai et al. 2012). Moreover, it is found that the Bayesian method is time-consuming and it requires several sensors and thousands of monitor data. Therefore, simple, rapid, and economical method for contaminant source location identification is yet required urgently.",

The main conclusions are drawn as follows:For these two methods, the longer the sampling time, the better the identification result. When sampling time is fixed, the identification results of the two methods become worse with increase of sampling interval. A long sampling time is necessary for accurate identification if the response time of sensor is large.The effects of response time and measurement error of sensor on the accurate identification by the MCC method are small compared to that of the MDD method. This means that the MCC method has higher interference-free ability than the MDD method. The MDD method has an advantage of rapid identification; however, it requires the sensor to have a short response time and less measurement error sensor. For the MCC method, such requirement is unnecessary.The two methods can identify the location of an unknown source when the sampling time, sampling interval, and response time are proper, and the measurement error of sensor is not very large.\n",
