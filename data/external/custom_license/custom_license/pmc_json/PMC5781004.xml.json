Interestingly, comparing the seasonal influenza vaccine target groups of elderly people and those with chronic illnesses, one notes similarities between our results (66\u00b77% and 47\u00b70% respectively) and those reported by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on behalf of Department of Health for registered patients in general practices in England for 2003\u20134 (78\u00b71% in 2005\u20136 for 65 or over aged population and 47\u00b72% in 2003\u20134, respectively),\n40\n and quite consistent with that observed in Swiss business travellers (27\u00b72%).\n42\n\n",

A particular consideration would be a caution with the prescription of stand\u2010by antivirals for travellers to malarious areas,\n47\n given that malaria may present as influenza\u2010like illness: seasonality and destination would need consideration by the prescribing practitioner. Support for this strategy comes from a recent study conducted in business travellers, which detected good knowledge of the transmission and symptoms of influenza; interestingly, 9\u00b77% of travellers in this study acknowledged having carried antiviral medication on their last business trip, with 7\u00b70% of travellers having actually used the carried medication.\n42\n\n",

An issue for travellers is the accessibility of safe and effective antivirals when travelling. The widespread practice of counterfeiting and lack of security in the drug supply in some regions argues for the carrying of personal medication sourced in the traveller\u2019s home country.",

Although our findings suggest that there is a role for travel clinics in both the prevention and treatment of influenza in travellers, corroboration of our findings in other travel clinic settings and among different cohorts of travellers is desirable. This could enable potentially the development of future guidance for the prevention of influenza in travellers, a highly mobile population who can introduce infections into susceptible populations with the potential public health consequences.",
