In contrast to cellular mRNAs, in which poly(A) is non-templated and is added post-transcriptionally, the viral poly(A) is believed to be template-coded (1). Accordingly, the negative strand contains a 5\u2032-poly(U) tract, which is synthesized using the poly(A) of the positive viral RNA as a template. In turn, this poly(U) subsequently serves as a template for the synthesis of the poly(A) of progeny RNA. This alternate usage of the homopolymeric parts of the (+) and (\u2212) RNA for each strand synthesis has not been studied in detail but it was observed that poly(U) in the negative RNA of poliovirus (2,3) and coronavirus (4) may be shorter than poly(A) in the viral RNAs. These observations pose intriguing questions about how a shorter poly(U) is synthesized on a longer poly(A) template and vice versa.",

This complex is thought to be involved in the switch that represses translation and allows replication to commence (9), and is also required for the initiation of both (+)-strand (6) and (\u2212)-strand RNA synthesis. The latter requires genome circularization mediated by an interaction between this RNP and the host poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound to 3\u2032-poly(A) (10,11).",

It ensures the covalent linkage of uridylates to the viral protein VPg via a two-step slide-back mechanism, thereby yielding the protein primer VPg-pU(pU) (15\u201318). Both (\u2212)- and (+)-strand RNA 5\u2032-termini have VPg covalently bound (5), but there is no consensus on whether the cre-mediated VPg-uridylylation is required for the initiation of only (+) RNA (19\u201321) or for the initiation of both strands (14). The former view implies that VPg uridylylation may occur directly on the 3\u2032-poly(A) of (+) RNA, thus providing a primer for elongation into (\u2212)-strands, in line with the finding that polyadenylates indeed support VPg-pUpU synthesis in vitro (22).",

We found that the 3\u2032-poly(A) of (+) RNA strands in CVB3 and some other enteroviruses is about 4-fold longer than the 5\u2032-poly(U) of (\u2212) strands and that the poly(A) length is controlled by the oriR. While ensuring efficient negative strand initiation, the oriR does not control the poly(U) length. Removal of the poly(A) (alone or together with the oriR) from transfected viral RNA resulted in regeneration of poly(A)-containing 3\u2032-tails, which, however, ensured only inefficient viral reproduction. These results provide new insights into mechanisms and evolution of genome replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.",

One can hypothesize that this mechanism involves the oriR. To examine this, two mutant RNAs, N70/A and N70/B, were generated, in which oriR was replaced by random sequences of 70 nt (Table 1). These RNAs proved to be viable but exhibited a reduced rate of replication [cytopathic effect (CPE) developed 4\u20136 days after transfection versus 2 days in the case of wild-type (wt) transcripts]. Sequencing the virus pools showed that N70/A had retained the engineered mutations while an adenosine insertion was found in N70/B within an internal oligo(A) tract downstream of the UAG stop codon (shown in bold, Table 1). The recovered viruses showed impaired replication (\u226510-fold decrease in the single-cycle growth yield at 8 h p.i.) and small-plaque phenotypes (Figure 2A,B). Luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons with the 3\u2032NCR replaced by the randomized RNA segments were assayed for RF accumulation in a cell-free system. The assay was performed with RNA transcripts containing two 5\u2032-terminal non-viral G residues (originating from T7 RNA polymerase promoter), which suppressed (+) strand RNA synthesis, allowing thereby estimation of the (\u2212) strand synthesis (14,38). Randomization of oriR resulted in a severe deficiency in RF accumulation (Figure 2C), suggesting impairment of the (\u2212) strand initiation. OriR randomization also inhibited RNA replication in BGM cells, as determined by using luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons (Figure 2D). The replicon RNAs used to transfect BGM cells contained authentic 5\u2032-ends (owing to the presence of a ribozyme sequence), improving replication kinetics (14,38). The viral RNAs extracted from virions harboring randomized oriRs possessed a markedly shortened 3\u2032-poly(A) (30\u201335 nt on average) but their 5\u2032-poly(U) on (\u2212) RNA retained a wt length of \u223c20 nt (Figure 2E).",

Disruption of this interaction by alteration of 6 nt (mutant KD1) or 4 nt (KD2) in the 3\u2032-terminal component of the kissing interaction (Figure 3C) resulted in quasi-infectious transcripts: after a delayed CPE, viable viruses were recovered from the transfected cultures but none of them faithfully retained the engineered structure. The pseudoreversions exhibited by the viruses could be grouped into two types. The representative of one class acquired a mutation restoring potential for a stable, though altered, kissing interaction. Thus, a C insertion at position 7350 could potentially support an alternative 6 nt kissing interaction (Figure 3D). When this mutation was engineered into the KD1 RNA, a virus (KD1+C) exhibiting a nearly wt phenotype was obtained, as judged by plaque size, single-cycle growth, cell-free RF formation and luciferase expression in transfected BGM cells (data not shown). The poly(A) of the KD1+C viral RNA was \u223c70 nt-long, close to the wt value (data not shown). Besides this C-insertion no other mutations were found thus far that could potentially restore the kissing interaction.",

The separate deletions of X or Y were engineered into p53CB3/T7 RNA, whereas more extended deletions were introduced into pRibCB3/T7, which was found to be more infectious owing to the presence of the hammerhead ribozyme sequence (14,38). All constructs tested had a poly(A) of 30 nt and generated CPE in transfected culture, though with a significant delay (Table 2).

A ribozyme-lacking N70-\u0394poly(A) mutant was dead. However, insertion of an AAUAAA-containing oligonucleotide into the randomized N70 sequence produced a viable virus with 3\u2032-poly(A) preceded by a long AU-rich region containing multiple AAUAAA hexamers (Table 1). The oriR-lacking RNAs terminated with G15 or C14G (together with a SalI site-derived UCGA) also generated viable genomes in which 3\u2032-poly(A) preceded by relatively long poly(U) tracts and an oligo(A) stretch interspersed with several single U residues, again generating AAUAAA polyadenylation-like signals (Table 1). All the recovered poly(A)-lacking viruses with 3\u2032NCR deletion/substitution generate minute plaques (Table 3), suggesting that they had a severe defect in viral replication.",

It is unknown whether they appear just by chance or are selected because they promote recruitment of the host polyadenylation machinery. A possible contribution of the AAUAAA signals to the appearance of oligo(A) stretches in the aberrant 3\u2032-tails of the viral RNA is supported by the finding that the addition of this signal restored viability of \u03943\u2032NCR-N70-\u0394poly(A) RNA (Table 2). Also in Bamboo Mosaic Virus it was shown that this hexameric sequence is involved in genomic RNA polyadenylation (59). Furthermore, treatment of human cells with siRNAs specific for the cellular polyA polymerase resulted in downregulation of the enzyme and inhibition of poliovirus replication (C. Polacek and R. Andino, unpublished data). The origin of the poly(U) blocks in the (+) RNA molecules is enigmatic. It cannot be excluded that they are also due to a TNT-like activity. Remarkably, these segments are often located upstream of the 3\u2032-poly(A). Hence, if tailing occurs at the level of viral RNA, the 3\u2032-poly(A) may be added by snap-back synthesis on poly(U) blocks.

Second, oriR belongs to a class of cis-elements, which are important but not essential. It is tempting to assume that such elements could have been acquired at some steps of enterovirus evolution in order to increase viral fitness. If so, the oriR-lacking mutants could be regarded as relying on ancient, \u2018atavistic\u2019 replicative tools.
