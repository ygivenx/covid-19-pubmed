            "text": "With the commencement of large-scale human activities of trans-regional conquest, infectious diseases have become another major threat to individuals and groups besides the war and conflicts. Infectious disease refers to that, after being infected by the pathogenic microorganisms, the human bodies produce infectious factors that can cause epidemic diseases under certain conditions. Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma can cause infectious diseases, but the spread of infectious diseases need to meet three conditions: there must be a source of infection, a path of transmission, and susceptible populations. Source of infection refers to human or animals, which already have the growth and reproduction of the pathogen in their body and have been able to excrete the pathogen in certain ways. This includes a patient and a human or animal that carries the pathogen. The way that pathogens leave the source of infection and then reach another susceptible object is known as the route of transmission, including the transmission through respiratory tract (droplets), digestive tract, insect-borne, blood and other body fluids. People who suffer from a specific immune deficiency toward a certain disease are known as susceptible populations. The spread of infectious disease must meet the three prerequisites mentioned above at the same time.1 In addition to the three basic conditions, there are other factors that will affect the spread of infectious diseases, including natural factors and social factors. Natural factors mainly refer to the temperature, humidity, ecological conditions, animals and plants. Different pathogens have different growth and reproduction in different environment. Their capabilities to adapt to temperature and humidity, and their pH tolerance also vary. Social factors include population density, life habits, economic status and communication degree. First discovered in Guangdong, China, in 2002, the \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome\u201d virus (SARS-CoV) is currently considered to spread across species lines from civet cats to human bodies. Nevertheless, we cannot deny that there is a link between the spread of the disease and the local eating habits. Historically, it will take months for worldwide pandemic disease to spread to different countries. However, nowadays, with the advanced aviation industry, the virus can spread from Asia to the Americas overnight, and soon causes worldwide epidemic diseases.",

            "text": "The worldwide pandemic infectious diseases in history include plague, cholera, and smallpox and so on. Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis. The disease is spread via rat fleas, and also through skin contact, and droplets. It is highly infectious. Yersinia pestis has low tolerance toward dryness, light, and heat, but can survive in the wet, cold environment and organic bodies for several months.2 Cholera is a gastrointestinal disease. Vibrio cholera is the pathogen of this disease. Having water or food that are contaminated by patients or carriers, or eating polluted fish and shrimp can lead to the disease. Vibrio cholerae can survive for several weeks in the natural environment. It can survive longer in vivo algae or crustaceans. Early in the history, the disease can be spread through a large-scale war of conquest as a secondary means. For example, the Mongol armies utilized the plague to conquer Europe, \u201cThe origins of the plague have been traced to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia from where it was transported to Europe through a combination of rodents and fleas, both of which are carriers of the plague,\u201d \u201cIt has been assumed that 1346 was a crucial year when the plague infiltrated into Black Sea and eventually it came by the next year to Sicily and North Italy.\u201d3 The Black Death caused the loss of 30% of Europe\u2019s population in medieval. Spread of infectious diseases can also come along with large-scale population movements, such as the opening up of new routes after large-scale European settlers immigrated to the \u201cNew World\u201d of the Americas and other immigrant behavior which greatly affected the local ecology of disease. As a result, infectious disease in Europe diffused to the \u201cNew World\u201d Aboriginal populations, who had no antibodies against these diseases, resulting in a large number of Aboriginal deaths. \u201cEurasian germs played a key role in decimating native peoples in many other parts of the world, including Pacific islanders, Aboriginal Australians, and the Khoisan peoples (Hottentots and Bushmen) of southern Africa,\u201d \u201cCumulative mortalities of these previously unexposed peoples from Eurasian germs ranged from 50 to 100%.\u201d4",

            "text": "Modern epidemiology of infectious diseases has made some changes. In general, the number of bacterial infectious diseases is reduced, while the number of viral diseases is increasing. Moreover, infectious diseases spread quickly, and there are always new diseases coming out. Pandemics that used to cause great harm, such as smallpox, have been eliminated; the incidence of plague and cholera is also significantly reduced. This is due to the use of antibiotics and the implementation of immunization programs. There is also rejuvenation of some ancient infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis. Their incidence is on the rise, and the resistance rate is significantly higher. This can be attributed to the abuse of antibiotic use in livestock production and the clinical setting. New large-scale epidemics are mostly viral infectious diseases, which may be related to the following characteristics of virus: (1) simple virus structure\u2013 generally consisted of genetic material and envelop; after the infecting the host, it can quickly replicate and passage. Therefore, the number of this virus grows fast, which can also infect a large number of the host cell and lead to biological changes; (2) many viruses have a stronger tolerance on environment. For example, although the coronavirus are sensitive to heat and inactive in a temperature of more than 35 \u00b0C and can be killed in a temperature of 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, it can survive for a long time at room temperature. Therefore, it is more prevalent in the fall, winter and spring; SRAS-CoV is a new type of coronavirus. Compared to ordinary coronavirus, it is more tolerant in a high temperature. In a temperature of 56 \u00b0C, it needs 90 min to kill the virus, and the virus can survive in the feces of patients with diarrhea for more than four days.5 MERS-CoV has a similar tolerance with SARS-CoV. At 20 \u00b0C and 40% relative humidity, it can be very stable and survive for more than 48 h. At 30 \u00b0C and 30% relative humidity, it can also survive at least 24 h6; (3) viral is more subjected to gene mutation than before. Therefore, it is not easy to use vaccination which helps improve people\u2019s immunity. For example, the influenza virus which infects humans has a strong variability. In every 10\u201315 years, it can go through a complete conversion of the surface antigen and produce a new subtype. Human beings are not immune to the new, and thus will be infected in a pandemic. Began in March 2013, in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and some other places, there were outbreaks of avian flu, as first reported as the subtype of H7N9 virus. The domestic experts once believed that H7N9 did not have the ability to transmit among humans. However, with changes in certain locus genes, they are likely to have the ability to transmit among humans7; (4) there is a lack of specific antiviral drugs for viral infection currently. This virus is a parasite in the cells. There are a number of antiviral drugs that play a role in inhibiting the virus by blocking the virus from entering into cells, inhibiting viral replication and proliferation, etc., but they cannot completely kill the virus.",

Millions of Muslims from different continents simultaneously gather in the holy city of Mecca, which has a tropical arid climate. This has made the Hajj a potential cause of the spread of bacteria and viruses, especially in face of \u201cSARS\u201d and \u201cMiddle East respiratory syndrome\u201d and other global infectious diseases. As the world\u2019s largest gathering of Islamic pilgrimage activity and transnational movement of population, the Hajj poses a threat to public health to host countries such as Saudi Arabia. Unlike other international political, economic and even cultural activities, the Hajj is a religious assignment clearly requested in the Koran. Therefore, it is not possible to cancel the Hajj due to international health security challenges. The only choice is to strengthen the international health management cooperation and minimize Hajj\u2019s impact on international health security, on the basis of accumulated experience and the benefit of human beings.",

            "text": "The Hajj is a bond to connect Muslims from all over the world together on an annual basis. Since the second half of the nineteenth century, cooperation among sovereign states started to become an important way of international health governance, including the growing importance of the issues related with the Hajj. From 1851 to 1938, the International Health Conference was held 14 times. In particular, the Ninth International Health Conference held in Paris in 1894 started to pay attention to international health issues arising from the pilgrimage in Mecca. The conference reviewed the plan to gradually eliminate cholera from Egypt and the Mediterranean, which was proposed in the fourth conference that was held in Vienna in 1874, and measures proposed to prevent the outbreak of cholera in Europe during the eighth meeting held in Dresden in 1893. It defined health control on the Hajj as the third step of cholera, which was mainly based on several considerations: first, identify the Hajj as a major factor in the spread of cholera in the West, from the perspective of international public health. From 1871 to 1893, there were at least eight cholera epidemics happened in Mecca. The epidemic in 1893 is particularly severe, claimed the lives of thousands of pilgrims; from 1889 to 1891, the epidemic occurred in Mesopotamia and Syria was a proof of the danger of pilgrimage path from Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. Second, many European colonial powers had a direct interest in the Hajj. For example, the British-owned India had 60 million Muslims; the Dutch-owned East Indies, the French-owned Algeria, the Asian part of Russia, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Bosnia-Herzegovina also have a large number of Muslims. According to the report of the Austro-Hungarian Empire delegation submitted to this meeting, in 1893, among 120 Bosnian Muslim, 59 people were infected with cholera pilgrimage. On the way from Jeddah to Mecca, eroded human corpses could be seen from time to time, and those corpses were food for wild beasts and birds. According to the report that the French Consulate General in Jeddah submitted to this meeting, within 5 days, there were 35,000 deaths. A Mecca medical officer C. Izzedine pointed out that during the Hajj in that year, there were 30,336 people killed Hajj by the plague and the plague outbreak and rapid spread out to kilometers away from Mouna, which located 5 miles away from Mecca. Many corpses littered on the road to Mecca from Muna and the streets of Mecca. In 1893, among a total of 200,500 pilgrims, 15 in every 100 people had cholera. The conference requested the departure port to take preventive measures, and implement health monitoring on pilgrims who went crossing the Red Sea, and develop health guidelines for navigating in Persian Gulf. Among the 16 countries present in the conference, 13 countries (not include the Union Jack of Sweden and Norway, Turkey and the USA) signed the Convention. The UK had reservations on certain provisions of the Convention, although they endorsed the Convention, such as that the pilgrims must have sufficient backhaul route before departure, and each pilgrim on board must have at least 2 square meters of space.8",

            "text": "The international sanitary conference has led to modification of the International Sanitary Convention. The 12th conference held in Paris during 1911\u20131912 issued the new International Sanitary Convention, which incorporated provisions on Hajj health issues. For example, the Article 62 says, if plague and Cholera are in place around the region of Hijaz during the Hajj, ships and cruises that depart from Hijaz or the Red Sea coast of the Arabian Peninsula must take some preventive actions. If these ships are heading to Egypt, they must be observed, examined, and approved by Egyptian Ministry of Health, Maritime and Quarantine Bureau within 5 days, so that they can receive a plague-free pass permit. The examining takes place at Moses Springs by the side of the Red Sea.9,10 In addition, the International Sanitary Convention also includes special provisions targeting on the Hajj.11 After the end of World War I, the 13th conference was held in Paris in 1926. This conference inherited these terms, and added some Hajj-related supplementary provisions: (1) The Anglo-Dutch would co-regulate Kamaran, where quarantine stations were set up for Red Sea the pilgrims; (2) UK and Egypt agreed that the UK would have administrative control over the quarantine stations in Suakin, in order to defend the cotton areas in Sudan.12 Moreover, during the conference, stakeholders also decided to set up an office in Paris. Together with the Egyptian Ministry of Health, the Maritime and Quarantine Bureau, it managed the implementation of health surveillance in Mecca. Although since then, Saudi Arabia has been constantly complaining about these terms, accusing them of a violation of its sovereignty, the terms stayed effective until being modified in 1957.13 In 1969, the 22nd World sanitary conference adopted, amended and consolidated the original \u201cInternational Sanitary Convention,\u201d and renamed it as \u201cInternational Health Regulations (1969).\u201d Since June 2007, the international community has begun to implement the \u201cinternational Health regulations (2005).\u201d",

The majority of the Islamic world almost became colonies or escorts of great powers. They had no independent sovereignty, and therefore unable to protect its own interests in international conferences. Health cooperation among the international community during this period was mainly the maintenance of the health and security of the West. Their concerns and attention on the Hajj were merely because the Hajj activities might have a health and safety threat to the West and their geopolitical power in the Middle East. In particular, the Western countries did not care about specific health and security issues in Mecca\u2014they mainly focused on self-defense.

The Association aims to rescue the patients and wounded, after which the agency will doubtlessly continue to carry out more extensive work outside the battlefield. In 1940, it joint hands with the Charity Relief Association in Mecca, and extended to the Saudi Red Crescent Society (SRCS). In 1963, The Saudi Arabia Red Crescent Association (SRCA) was established in accordance with Royal Decree, which is headquartered in Riyadh. It has a national coverage. The system is built on the \u201cGeneva Convention\u201d and the basic principles of the International Red Cross Committee, which aims at reducing human suffering and pain caused by disasters without any discrimination. The Saudi Arabia Red Crescent Association is considered the sole representative of the Red Cross/Red Crescent organizations within the scope of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Their doctrine is formulated by the International Convention, and dedicates to provide medical services to the Saudi Arabian armed forces during wartime.24 The Saudi Arabia Red Crescent Association has a total of 118 centers in Mecca and Medina, 28 centers on the land and inner bay area, and 176 permanent centers; it has 1820 members in emergency services, which are equipped with 331 ambulances that can accommodate two patients at the same time.25 The Saudi Arabia Red Crescent Association is the only institution within the country\u2019s territory that has the capability to perform emergency medical services (EMS), and the rescue helicopters it is equipped with represent an advance level in the world.",

For Mecca, the major sources of international infectious disease is divided into two categories: one is viral diseases that spread in the areas outside of Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); the other is local viral diseases originated in Saudi Arabia, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); SARS viruses and MERS viruses both belong to coronavirus. The huge crowd of pilgrims is an intermediary agent between Saudi Arabia and other countries in the spread of viral diseases. There is a major challenge faced by the international community: How to prevent the invasion of infectious diseases to Saudi Arabia due to the Hajj? How to prevent local diseases to expand from Saudi Arabia to the world as a result of the Hajj?Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Hajj",

            "text": "In fact, the widely known \u201catypical pneumonia\u201d or \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d (SARS) is merely one kind of atypical pneumonia, but it is most widely known in the international community and led to a global panic. Present study suggests that, SARS virus is originated from China Rhinolophus,26 and its intermediate hosts are civet cats. The virus transmission follows the route of \u201cBats-civet cats-human beings.\u201d When Human bodies are infected, the virus is capable of specifically binding the receptor ACE2 in lungs, and thus enters human cells. As this receptor barely exists on the surface of respiratory tract, to cause infection, human beings need to inhale a certain amount of the virus in susceptible area. This feature of the disease determines that the SARS virus mainly infects people who live in a crowded environment and have close contact with patients, such as health care workers, family members and so on. World Health Organization confirmed that SARS was originated in Guangdong, China. It was first found in early November 2002. Two to three months later, with substantial population movements, it began to spread to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. The international community tried to keep SARS outside of Saudi Arabia during Hajj. Because as a purely lunar, the Islamic calendar has a large difference with the Gregorian calendar, there is a gap between annual Hajj month Dhu al-Hijjah and calendar month. In the year 2003, Hajj began in January when SARS had not caused a severe global diffusion yet. The main affected areas were not Islamic countries. Muslim communities in northwest China were not the predominant affected areas as well. Therefore, it did not pose a health and safety threat to the Hajj. However, with the spread of this disease and the full involvement of the World Health Organization, the international community began to realize that the Umrah in 2013 and Hajj in early 2004 might lead to global proliferation of SARS.",

Certainly, it was very crowded, which was why stampede accidents often happened. This also indicated that the person to person transmission of SARS and other infectious diseases were more likely to occur. On April 10, 2003, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health banned the entry of those who recently visited the affected areas. Saudi Arabian Visa Centers in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Philippines were asked to stop issuing Umrah visas. Saudi Arabia also set up isolation stations in the nation\u2019s major hospitals in various regions. In addition, the ports of entry strengthened the health examine and quarantine in accordance with World Health Organization\u2019s requirements. For example, if the traveler\u2019s temperature was over 38 \u00b0C, he/she would be questioned by staffs with the questions prepared by World Health Organization: (1) whether they had other symptoms of SRAS, such as coughing, difficulty in breathing and shortness of breath; (2) whether they or their family members were diagnosed with SARS (close contact with patients); and (3) in the previous 10 days, whether they had been to any SARS-infected areas. On April 28, 2003, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health established a special committee that is headquartered in Riyadh to handle SARS-related matters. With the close cooperation of the international community, SARS was gradually under control. After the World Health Organization\u2019s report of 20 consecutive days without a new case, on July 8, 2003, Saudi Arabia removed the ban on entry of people from SARS-affected areas, and meanwhile still maintained strict immigration health monitoring. On September 27\u2013November 10, 2003, 3 million Muslims attended the Umrah, among which 1.8 million Muslims were from Saudi Arabia, and 120 million were foreign Muslims. For pilgrims from infected areas, Saudi Arabia prohibited their entry within 10 days after leaving their own country.27 Because of the close cooperation between the Ministry of Health, other Saudi Arabian government sectors, and the World Health Organization, as well as their deployment and strict measures to prevent SARS from affecting the country, Saudi Arabia had no reported cases of SARS infection. In fact, the entire Middle East region had no cases of SARS infection. Based on the successful experience of Umrah in the second half of 2003, the Hajj in early 2004 was also successfully held. There were a total of 2,012,074 million Muslims attended, including 1,419,706 million non-Saudi Arabian Muslims\u2014these amount were lower than the number of Muslim pilgrims in early 2003: the total amount was 2,041,129 and number of non-Saudi Arabian Muslims as 1,431,012 million.28(2)Hajj and Middle East respiratory syndrome",

Saudi Arabia seeks to ensure the infection disease will not and spread to the broader population due to Hajj. In early 2012, a Saudi Arabian patient infected with the MERS passed away. MERS virus was first extracted by an Egyptian virologist Ali Mohamed Zaki who lived in Jeddah, from a 60-year-old man who was infected separation. He named this virus a novel coronavirus. On September 20, 2012, the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) first revealed this virus in the ProMED-mail.29 MERS virus had been called \u201cSARS-like virus\u201d until May 2013. It was even called \u201cSaudi Arabian SARS\u201d in Western countries. Currently, intermediate hosts of MERS virus are still not unknown. There were reports showing that patients made some contacts with camels and sheep before they were found infected. It has been found that the virus can replicate multiply within primates, bats, pigs and other animal cells, suggesting that the virus may have a broader host of infection.30 In terms of the incubation period, the two viruses are different: SARS-infected patients have about 2\u201314 days of incubation period, while the MERS virus has an incubation period of about 10 days after infection. With the advanced aviation industry, there\u2019s enough time for patients to carry MERS virus to other countries and regions after they are infected but before obvious symptoms appear.",

As the president of the US National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, William Schaffner said, \u201cI think the government is confident in its health facilities, is confident in its capabilities and, from day one, we told them that we would put guidelines and recommendations but we will not prevent people from coming to Hajj.\u201d31 According to requirements of the \u201cInternational Health regulations,\u201d the World Health Organization promptly informed its member countries about the specific circumstances of MERS \u201cWHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia, as in previous years, to support the country\u2019s health measures for all visitors participating in the Hajj to Mecca next month.\u201d32 During the 2012 Hajj, Saudi Arabian Red Crescent Association sent out 1750 responders and 600 volunteers to area areas of critical events, including 26 stations and 47 spots; mobile command centers located in buses coordinated actions in the region. In the densely populated areas, they also sent rescue workers riding motorcycles to facilitate the diagnosis and first-aid; they even dispatched eight medical helicopters to facilitate transport of patients; the whole team dealt with 6660 bags of saline, 3710 bags of 5% dextrose solution (D5 W) and 10,150 bags of Ringer\u2019s lactate.

Pilgrims were requested to provide meningitis vaccination certificate for at least 10 days prior to travel to Saudi Arabia.37 On July 25, World Health Organization released travel advisory for Hajj in that year. \u201cThis paper provides guidance to national authorities of countries from which pilgrims will be traveling in the coming months for Umra and Hajj for the prevention, detection and management of imported cases of MERS-CoV.

In that year, the number of foreign pilgrims was 1.379531 million. They were from 188 countries, of which 1.292098 million arrived by air, 72,535 people arrived by land, 14,898 people arrived by sea and land.

Due to the sharp decline in the total number of pilgrims and the effort of Saudi Arabian Red Crescent Association, during the Hajj in October 2013, the emergency aid service fell by 28%, and the country provided uninterrupted emergency services, including 32 emerging cases involving airplanes.41 There was no case of MERS infection during the Hajj in 2013 as well.",
