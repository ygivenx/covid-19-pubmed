For cytoplasmic viral RNA, this involves detection by cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors, such as RIG-I and Mda5, and the initiation of signaling cascades that induce the expression of cytokines, including type I interferon. Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and IFN-\u03b2 are secreted and signal through the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) to transmit a danger signal to neighboring cells. The activated IFNAR triggers a signaling pathway consisting of the kinase Jak and STAT transcription factors, inducing the expression of a large array of interferon-stimulated genes encoding molecules with antiviral activity, thus establishing the so-called 'host cell antiviral state'2,3,4. These interferon-stimulated genes include those encoding the protein kinase PKR, as well as stress-inducible proteins such as IFIT1 and IFIT2 (also known as ISG56 and ISG54, respectively), which impair the host cell protein synthesis apparatus4,5,6,7.",

            "text": "Although the distinction between self and non-self RNA is believed to rely on the molecular signatures found in pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the exact nature of such signatures remains elusive. Both cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and Mda5) bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA); however, RIG-I seems to 'prefer' short dsRNA, whereas Mda5 can specifically bind long dsRNA8. In addition, RIG-I can specifically recognize 5\u2032-triphosphate groups on single-stranded RNA and (partially) dsRNA9,10,11. In contrast, eukaryotic mRNA, which is not recognized by RIG-I or Mda5, usually has a 5\u2032 cap structure methylated at the N7 position of the capping guanosine residue (cap 0), the ribose-2\u2032-O position of the 5\u2032-penultimate residue (cap 1) and sometimes at adjoining residues (cap 2)12. Two evolutionary forces are thought to be responsible for the presence of 5\u2032 cap structures on eukaryotic mRNA: the appearance of 5\u2032 exonucleases in eukaryotes and the need for a means of directing mRNA to the eukaryotic ribosome13. Thus, eukaryotic mRNA 5\u2032 cap structures are known to increase mRNA stability and translational efficacy. Notably, although N7 methylation is important in many mRNA-related processes, such as transcriptional elongation, polyadenylation, splicing, nuclear export and efficient translation, there is no obvious reason for the evolution of 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA ribose in cap 1 and cap 2 structures in higher eukaryotes.",

            "text": "The functional importance of mRNA 5\u2032-structures is inferred from the fact that many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm (such as picornaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses and poxviruses) have evolved alternative 5\u2032 elements, such as small viral proteins linked to the 5\u2032 end of genomic RNA14, or encode functions associated with the formation of a 5\u2032 cap that are homologous to those found in eukaryotic cells, such as RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase, RNA guanylyltransferase, RNA guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-methyltransferase), and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase. The fact that RNA 5\u2032-triphosphate groups activate RIG-I (refs. 9,10) suggests that viruses must hide or modify their RNA 5\u2032 structures to evade innate immune recognition. In addition, RIG-I activation is diminished when 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA contains modified nucleotides9. Thus, RNA modifications such as methylation could be critical factors for the activation of RNA-specific pattern-recognition receptors. Notably, this idea of methylation-based distinction of self and non-self nucleic acids is well established for DNA, as the methylation status of CpG dinucleotide motifs in DNA is the structural basis of the activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)15. Moreover, DNA methylation represents the basis for the ancient bacterial restriction and modification systems that allow bacteria to distinguish between foreign DNA and the bacterial genome.",

We demonstrate that human and mouse coronavirus mutants lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity induced higher expression of type I interferon and were extremely sensitive to type I interferon treatment. Furthermore, a mouse coronavirus mutant with an inactivated 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase was attenuated in wild-type macrophages but replicated efficiently in the absence of IFNAR or Mda5. The coronavirus 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants were apathogenic in wild-type mice; however, viral replication and spreading was restored in mice lacking IFNAR and in mice lacking TLR7 and Mda5, the two main sensors of coronavirus RNA. Collectively our results show a link between Mda5-mediated sensing of viral RNA and 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA and suggest that RNA modifications such as 2\u2032-O-methylation provide a molecular signature for the distinction of self and non-self mRNA.",

We generated a mutant of the recombinant human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) with an inactivated 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase. We produced this mutant by substituting alanine for the aspartic acid at position 129 of the highly conserved catalytic KDKE tetrad of nsp16 (HCoV-D129A; Fig. 1b). Notably, this substitution completely abrogates the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity of recombinant, bacteria-expressed nsp16 proteins of feline coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus16,18. The mutant virus had a small plaque phenotype and less replication in the human fibroblast MRC-5 cell line (Fig. 2a,b). We were able to readily methylate poly(A)-containing RNA from HCoV-D129A-infected cells using the vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase VP39 in vitro21 (Fig. 2c), which confirmed the loss of 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity by HCoV-D129A. In contrast, in vitro 2\u2032-O-methylation of poly(A)-containing RNA derived from HCoV-229E-infected cells was indistinguishable from the 2\u2032-O-methylation of poly(A)-containing RNA obtained from mock-infected cells. We observed significantly higher IFN-\u03b2 expression in blood-derived human macrophages after infection with HCoV-D129A than after infection with HCoV-229E, (Fig. 2d) and complete restriction of HCoV-D129A replication in human macrophages pretreated with IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 2e). These results suggest a biological role for 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA in the context of the induction of type I interferon and antiviral effector mechanisms stimulated by type I interferon.",

In addition, we generated a recombinant MHV mutant with a tyrosine-to-alanine substitution at the putative cap 0\u2013binding site of nsp16 (MHV-Y15A; Fig. 1b). This substitution impairs cap 0 binding for the corresponding feline coronavirus nsp16 mutant Y14A18, and we expected that this substitution would result in less 2\u2032-O-methylation of coronaviral mRNA, rather than complete abrogation of this. Indeed, in vitro methylation of mRNA with the vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase VP39 (ref. 21) confirmed the differences in 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA obtained from MHV-infected cells. The transfer of 3H-labeled methyl groups from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine to mRNA was less efficient for mRNA derived from MHV-Y15A-infected cells than for mRNA from MHV-D130A-infected cells but significantly more efficient than for mRNA from MHV-A59-infected cells (Fig. 3a). These results demonstrate the loss of 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity by MHV-D130A and show that a considerable proportion of MHV-Y15A mRNA is not methylated at the 2\u2032-O position.",

Also, there was no notable difference among cells infected with MHV-A59, MHV-D130A or MHV-Y15A in the formation and morphology of double-membraned vesicles in the cytoplasm, as observed by electron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 1). That observation is relevant to the cytoplasmic sensing of viral RNA, as coronavirus double-membraned vesicles are known to contain dsRNA. Infection with either of the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants (MHV-Y15A or MHV-D130A) resulted in more production of type I interferon in wild-type macrophages at 15 h after infection (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Likewise, type I interferon was efficiently produced in IFNAR-deficient macrophages infected with MHV-D130A or MHV-Y15A (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 2b), which indicated that the MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants triggered the production of type I interferon in the absence of IFNAR signaling. Neither MHV-A59 nor the two 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutant viruses induced any detectable expression of type I interferon in Mda5-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3e), whereas the production of type I interferon was readily detectable in Mda5-deficient cells after infection with Sendai virus. Detailed analysis of the kinetics of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression showed that infection of wild-type macrophages (Fig. 3f) and IFNAR-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3g) with MHV-D130A or MHV-Y15A resulted in higher expression of the gene encoding IFN-\u03b2 (with a peak at 12 h after infection) than did MHV-A59 infection. Notably, the induction of IFN-\u03b2 was greatest after infection with MHV-D130A, which has a mutant 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase active site. These results indicate that deficiency in 2\u2032-O-methylation in viral RNA induces higher IFN-\u03b2 expression and that IFN-\u03b2 induction after infection with viruses with mutant 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases is Mda5 dependent.",

We investigated the viral replication kinetics of MHV-D130A and MHV-Y15A in primary macrophages, which represent the most important target cells for MHV22,27. MHV-D130A replication was considerably impaired in wild-type macrophages (even after infection at a high MOI of 1), whereas the replication of MHV-Y15A was similar to that of MHV-A59 (Fig. 5a). MHV-D130A replication was fully restored in Mda5-deficient macrophages, even after infection at a low MOI of 0.0001 (Fig. 5b). This demonstrates that Mda5-dependent expression of type I interferon is a prerequisite for the induction of effective restriction of MHV-D130A replication. In agreement with the idea that MHV-D130A replication was impaired in wild-type macrophages, but MHV-Y15A replication was not, we observed much less replication of MHV-D130A in macrophages pretreated with IFN-\u03b1. Thus, in contrast to MHV-A59, MHV-D130A was not detectable at 24 h after infection after 4 h of pretreatment of wild-type macrophages with 50\u2013200 units of IFN-\u03b1, whereas MHV-Y15A replication was not restricted much (Fig. 5c). In Mda5-deficient macrophages, pretreatment with at least 200 units of IFN-\u03b1 was needed to restrict MHV-D130A replication to undetectable amounts (Fig. 5d), which suggested that endogenous expression of type I interferon mediated by Mda5 affected the MHV-D130A restriction in wild-type macrophages. These data indicate that the D130A and Y15A substitutions of MHV nsp16 had different effects on the induction of type I interferon and viral replication. The D130A substitution led to more production of type I interferon as well as to considerable sensitivity to pretreatment with type I interferon. In contrast, the Y15A substitution induced more production of type I interferon but not more sensitivity to type I interferon. Thus, we conclude that in addition to triggering Mda5-dependent induction of type I interferon, loss of 2\u2032-O-methylation triggers a second antiviral mechanism that is induced by type I interferon and accounts for the restriction of viral replication during the host cell antiviral state.",

To assess whether this molecular mechanism is also relevant to coronavirus infection, we analyzed the replication kinetics of MHV-A59, MHV-D130A and MHV-Y15A in primary macrophages derived from wild-type or IFIT1-deficient mice. MHV-D130A replication was almost completely restored in IFIT1-deficient macrophages (Fig. 6), analogous to the restoration of MHV-D130A replication in Mda5-deficient macrophages (Fig. 5a,b). These results suggest that the Mda5-dependent induction of type I interferon and the IFIT-1-mediated restriction of viral replication are two distinct antiviral mechanisms based on the distinction between 2\u2032-O-methylated mRNA and nonmethylated mRNA.",

We compared the phenotype of MHV-A59 with that of each MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutant in C57BL/6 mice after intraperitoneal infection with 500 plaque-forming units of virus (Fig. 7). In contrast to MHV-A59, neither of the MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants was detectable in spleen or liver of C57BL/6 mice at 48 h after infection, which demonstrated the importance of 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA for efficient replication and spread in the host. However, the two MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants replicated and spread in IFNAR-deficient mice. MHV-D130A was not detectable in spleens or livers of mice lacking either Mda5 or TLR7, which suggested that induction of the expression of type I interferon via either RNA sensor suffices to completely restrict the replication and spread of mutants with altered 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase active sites. However, we were able to detect small amounts of the cap 0\u2013binding mutant MHV-Y15A in the spleens of TLR7-deficient or Mda5-deficient mice, which suggested that lower induction of type I interferon in these mutant mice did not fully restrict replication of the virus with partially impaired 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase. The replication and spread of the two MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants in mice deficient in both TLR7 and Mda5 was indistinguishable from that in IFNAR-deficient mice. These observations confirm that TLR7 and Mda5 represent the main sensors for recognition of coronavirus RNA and demonstrate that 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA serves as a mechanism by which viruses evade the recognition of non-self RNA by the host innate immune system in vivo.",

Using human and mouse coronavirus models of infection, we have shown here that 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA provides a molecular signature with a dual role in the interaction with host innate immune responses. First, 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA protects viral RNA from recognition by Mda5 and thus prevents Mda5-dependent production of type I interferon in virus-infected cells. Second, 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA contributes to evasion of the interferon-mediated restriction of viral replication. These distinct effects can be uncoupled either in the absence of type I interferon signaling (such as in IFNAR-deficient cells or mice) or through a genetic approach that targets the cap 0\u2013binding residue Tyr15 of MHV nsp16. The lack of 2\u2032-O-methylation on a proportion of MHV-Y15A mRNA was sufficient to trigger the Mda5 pathway of the production of type I interferon while allowing the virus to evade the IFIT1-mediated restriction of viral replication. In contrast, the absence of 2\u2032-O-methylation on the MHV-D130A viral RNA activated the Mda5 pathway and resulted in restriction of viral propagation.",

The use of coronavirus greatly facilitated this analysis because coronaviruses encode their own 5\u2032 mRNA cap-methylation machinery, which allowed us to study the phenotype of recombinant viruses with mutant 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase proteins, and because expression of type I interferon is almost undetectable in infected cells other than plasmacytoid dendritic cells, with the notable exception of macrophages, which produce small amounts of Mda5-mediated type I interferon after infection23,24,25,29. In contrast, most other RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm induce considerable amounts of type I interferon, which may mask the specific effect of 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA on Mda5 activation2,30. It will be important to clarify whether viral mRNA lacking 2\u2032-O-methylation is directly recognized by Mda5, resulting in its activation, or whether 2\u2032-O-methylation represents an activation signal for Mda5, possibly in combination with dsRNA regions. The generation of recombinant viruses with defined substitutions in RNA-processing enzymes, combined with biochemical approaches, will thus be useful in the identification of naturally occurring Mda5 ligands.",

Other viruses, such as bunyaviruses and arenaviruses, that replicate in the cytoplasm but have not acquired the ability to autonomously generate and modify their 5\u2032 cap structures have evolved means for snatching the cap structure from cellular mRNA31,32. Moreover, structural and functional analyses have shown that the cap-binding nucleoprotein of Lassa virus (family Arenaviridae) can antagonize type I interferon through its associated 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity, probably by cleaving RNAs that function as pathogen-associated molecular patterns33. This protein has an unusually deep cap-binding pocket proposed to accommodate an entire cap 1 structure33 and could potentially discriminate between 2\u2032-O-methylated and nonmethylated capped RNAs. Finally, members of the Picornavirales order and related viruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm but do not encode methyltransferases, have evolved alternative 5\u2032 ends of their RNA. These viruses covalently attach a small viral protein (VPg) to the genomic 5\u2032 terminus and have an internal ribosomal entry site at the 5\u2032 untranslated region34. The replication of encephalomyocarditis virus (family Picornaviridae) seems to be not restricted by IFIT proteins28; however, infection with this virus is sensed through the Mda5 pathway35. Thus, we speculate that the use of internal ribosomal entry allows encephalomyocarditis virus to evade host restriction by IFIT family members, whereas the covalent attachment of VPg to the 5\u2032 end of picornavirus RNA does not prevent Mda5-dependent recognition and induction of type I interferon.",
