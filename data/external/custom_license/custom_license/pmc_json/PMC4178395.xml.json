Genetic analysis showed that HKU15-OH1987 is closely related to 2 deltacoronavirus strains that were detected in Hong Kong, China, in 2012: HKU15-155 and HKU15-44 (2). We also demonstrated the presence of histopathologic lesions in the small intestines of PorCoV HKU15\u2013infected piglets with diarrhea (L. Wang, unpub. data). In April 2014, a novel swine enteric coronavirus disease caused by PorCoV HKU15 or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus was reported to the World Animal Health Organization by the US Department of Agriculture (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15133).",

The states from which samples had been submitted were Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. Among those samples, 435 were selected to be tested for the presence of PorCoV HKU15. A real-time reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the membrane protein gene was used to identify PorCoV HKU15. Samples with a cycle threshold value of <35 were considered positive on the basis of validation data using the cloned membrane protein gene (data not shown). Of the 435 samples, 109 (25%) from 9 states (all states mentioned above, excluding Maryland) were positive for PorCoV HKU15 by real-time reverse transcription PCR (Figure). Of those 109 samples, 19 (17%) were also positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. This result suggests that PorCoV HKU15 is prevalent among pig populations in the major pig-producing US states.",

Sequence analysis showed that strains from South Dakota (SD3424), Nebraska (NE3579), Illinois (IL2768), Indiana (IN2847), Kentucky (KY4813), Michigan (MI6148), and Pennsylvania (PA3148) have the same genome size (25,422 nt) as OH1987, and whole-genome pairwise comparison showed that they share a high nucleotide similarity (>99.8%). Furthermore, all of the isolates share high nucleotide similarity (98.9%\u201399.2%) with the 2 PorCoV HKU15 strains in GenBank, HKU15-155 and HKU15-44. ",

This finding indicates that 1 genotype of PorCoV HKU15 is currently circulating in multiple US states. This result was further supported by phylogenetic trees constructed by using the full-length amino acids of spike and nucleocapsid proteins (Technical Appendix Figure, panels B, C). Because of limitation of the samples received, only a partial genome sequence was determined for strain MN3092 from Minnesota. However, on the basis of the spike and nucleocapsid protein sequence analyses, it is highly likely that the entire genome of the Minnesota strain is genetically identical to that of the other 8 strains (Technical Appendix Figure, panels B, C).",
