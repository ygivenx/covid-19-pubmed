We used the assay-specific cutoff (optical density ratio 0.3) that had been validated in a previous study of camel serum samples (13). A total of 228 (29.5%) of 774 dromedary camels were rated MERS-CoV positive by the rELISA (Table 1). All 228 rELISA-positive serum samples from these 228 camels were subsequently tested at a 1:40 dilution by using an established recombinant immunofluorescence assay and Vero cells expressing MERS-CoV spike protein (6). This confirmatory assay showed that 213 (93.4%) of 228 rELISA-positive serum samples had MERS-CoV antibodies (Table 1).",

Different types of animal husbandry in the Northeastern and Eastern regions of Kenya might be better predictors of virus transmission among camels. Dromedary camels in this area are often nomadic following rainfall patterns, and are taken across borders into neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia, for trade purposes (13). The observed increase in seropositivity from the Western region to the Northeastern and Eastern regions could be attributed to increased animal-to-animal contact in cross-border dromedary camel metapopulations.",

Our recent finding of a MERS-CoV ancestor in bats from South Africa (3) highlights the need for wider investigations of viral reservoirs. The fact that no human MERS cases have been observed in eastern Africa could indicate less transmissibility of viruses in regional lineages or lack of detection and reporting of cases. Serosurveys of persons handling dromedary camels in this region could help to determine whether silent or unrecognized infections are being maintained in humans.",
