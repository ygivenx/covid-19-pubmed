            "text": "We have traditionally associated the term \u201cBiodefense\u201d with military applications. However, since October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent in envelopes through the US Postal Service, our understanding of biodefense has shifted significantly.  We now see biodefense as the process to protect both civilian and military populations. It has become clear that many highly pathogenic microorganisms can be considered as either agents of biological warfare or naturally occurring emerging disease threats. In addition, we consider bioterrorism from varying points of view, including public health threats, veterinary threats, and agricultural threats. Taken together, they can be considered to be \u201cbiothreats\u201d. The biodefense field represents a unique challenge for vaccine development as the traditional economic models for vaccine development are based on large populations purchasing a vaccine to protect against common infectious diseases in order that a vaccine pharma can make a profit. The situation in biodefense is very different where the goal is to stockpile vaccines with the hope that they will never be used. Relatively small markets, combined with the difficulties of working with many of these agents\u2014many of which require biosafety level 3 or 4 containment\u2014means that there are currently no vaccines licensed for general use in the United States and most other countries for nearly all of the biothreat agents. There are major hurdles to the development of biodefense vaccines. In addition to the traditional issues of identifying protective immunogens and platforms to deliver the vaccines, there are major difficulties in undertaking efficacy studies as most of the diseases are rare, occur sporadically, or are not found naturally.  Accordingly, emphasis is being placed on appropriate animal models to demonstrate efficacy in support of licensure. However, at this time, no vaccine has been approved based on animal efficacy trials only. Nonetheless, a significant amount of data are being accumulated describing the molecular basis of disease, which provides a strong foundation for continuing product development. The current state of biodefense vaccines in clinical development is summarized in Table 1.",

With the increasing affordability of high-throughput sequencing, concepts such as reverse vaccinology\u2014using pathogen genome sequences to produce peptides and nucleic acids for vaccine testing\u2014have become more established [11, 12]. As our understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis continues to grow, coupled with large numbers of genome sequences for various pathogens becoming available and novel bioinformatics tools to facilitate their analysis, we are heading towards a position where vaccines can be rationally designed based on our molecular knowledge. This includes selection of an optimum immunogen and delivery system to maximize the host protective immune response rather than empirical approaches that were used for much of the 20th century. The continuing generation of high-throughput datasets characterizing high-priority biodefense and public health pathogens, and their host responses in the post-genomic era, will require novel bioinformatic techniques. These computational approaches will allow a more complete and thorough understanding of infection and pathogenesis, and greatly facilitate rational vaccine design. This review describes some of these methods and how they can be used in the development of novel vaccines against biothreat viruses.",

            "text": "A successful vaccine must be both safe and immunogenic. Many pathogenic viruses interfere with the development of a protective immune response by preventing the activation of key aspects of the immune response, from inhibition of IRF-3 phosphorylation to block type-I interferon synthesis to sequestering MHC-I in the cell to prevent display of virus-derived peptides. A central feature of many biothreat pathogens is the infection of macrophages and dendritic cells as the primary target for replication. Infection of these cell types enables viruses to prevent immune response development at an early, central stage. For example, dendritic cells infected with Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), an Old World arenavirus used to infect macaques as a model for Lassa fever, lead to downregulation of MHC-II on the dendritic cell surface, inhibiting the ability of these cells to present antigen and develop the adaptive immune response [13] while Marburg virus infection of macaques leads to downregulation of MHC-II on dendritic cells in the spleen [14]. Effects such as these are common following infection with these viruses resulting in significantly impairment of the host to develop a protective immune response at an early stage of infection. The downregulation of MHC-II has also been observed in a microarray study of PBMCs from LCMV-infected macaques with pathogenic virus inducing a greater downregulation than infection with attenuated virus [15]. Interestingly, MHC-II was upregulated in liver tissues [16], highlighting the importance of animal models and role of the host as having different functional systems, which may respond differently to a similar challenge at the molecular level.",

Similarly, deletion of an entire multigene family, with a hypothesized role in modulation of the interferon system, still results in viral replication [18]. If the viral proteins responsible for mediating inhibition of the host immune response can be determined, then targeted mutations can be made to disrupt these effects, counteracting the inhibition of the host immune response and allowing the host to induce either an innate and/or a protective immune response. In this way, live-attenuated viruses may be developed for further characterization as novel vaccine candidates. ",

In these situations, individual proteins may have a single function only, allowing entire genes to be knocked out to attenuate the virus, as is seen with vaccinia virus. In some cases, sufficient redundancy may exist requiring the deletion of multiple genes or whole genome sections to sufficiently attenuate the virus. For example, African swine fever virus, from another family of large DNA viruses, causes a hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs and encodes a number of genes that modulate the host immune response. One such gene, A238L, encodes a protein which inhibits the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, a central regulator of inflammation and the innate immune response [19]. However, deleting this gene does not cause any difference in porcine disease [20]. Similarly, deletion of an entire multigene family with a hypothesized role in modulation of the interferon system still results in viral replication [21, 22].",

In these cases, the deletion of entire genes may result in a non-viable virus. This illustrates the importance of identifying the individual residues/regions responsible for specific virus-host interactions. If specific residues are identified that are important in determining virulence or in modulating the host immune response, but do not interfere in the critical functions of viral replication, mutation of these sites may lead to novel vaccine candidates. For example, recent mapping of the Nipah virus P gene has identified a region that is required for inhibition of STAT-1 signaling, but without disrupting its function as a cofactor for the viral polymerase [23].",

While these data are often limited to transcription rather than expression at the protein level, they have provided significant insight into which classes of host genes are up- and downregulated in response to virus infections. A novel application of this technology is to use the differentially expressed genes as a marker of upstream transcription factor activation using bioinformatics tools such as CARRIE [24, 25]. In this way, host signaling pathways activated or repressed by virus infection can be inferred and studied further, in particular those inhibited by virus-induced proteins that are critical in the pathogenesis of the virus (see below).",

These studies have also identified innate immune mechanisms that are suppressed during infection. Identifying such cellular proteins may allow the development of novel therapeutics, for example, by inhibiting a cellular kinase required for viral entry or replication [26\u201328]. However, it is likely that these studies may not provide the key information required to aid the development of novel vaccines as elucidating correlates of protection is not possible if the study compares candidate vaccine-infected versus mock-infected groups without including wild-type virulent virus-infected groups or vice versa. Currently, there are few high-throughput systems-level studies employing these types of comparisons in vivo. Analyses of human transcriptional responses to the yellow fever 17D vaccine have provided significant insights into the host response to this attenuated virus [29], but such studies, not surprisingly, lack inclusion of the human response to Asibi virus (the wild-type parent to vaccine strain 17D) and limit our knowledge of the molecular basis of attenuation of 17D virus. However, studies using virulent/attenuated pairs, such as LCMV WE/Armstrong infection in macaques [15, 16], allow one set of responses to be \u201csubtracted\u201d from the other, filtering the dataset down to a more manageable size for further analysis and potential correlation of transcriptional profiles with pathogenesis or protection.",

The striking differences in phenotype are caused by a small number of mutations, with three amino acid differences in the envelope glycoprotein precursor, one in the nucleoprotein, and five in the polymerase. Interestingly, while the nucleoprotein has been shown to play an important role in the inhibition of interferon induction [38, 39], the mutation observed in the Pichind\u00e9 virus nucleoprotein does not inhibit this function [37]. Taken together with the observation described above that a single amino acid in the VP35 protein of Ebola virus is sufficient to disrupt the viral inhibition of innate immune signaling, it suggests that modulation of immune function is not the sole determinant of pathogenicity for this virus. The recent development of an infectious clone system [40] will allow further characterization of the roles of these mutations and shed light on the relation of individual amino acid changes to arenavirus pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Similar findings have been reported using non-high-throughout assays. A number of studies have compared Lassa virus with the related naturally nonvirulent arenavirus Mopeia virus. Infection of monocytes, targets of arenavirus infection in vivo and central mediators of the development of a protective immune response, with Lassa virus does not result in cell activation or production of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-8, and consequently the host immune response to virus infection is inhibited. In contrast, IL-8 production is not suppressed and interferon signaling is activated in Mopeia virus-infected cells, allowing the host immune response to be induced [41, 42]. Dendritic cells, which are professional antigen-presenting cells, are also targets of hemorrhagic fever virus infection. Lassa virus infection of dendritic cells inhibits upregulation of the correct cell-surface expression of proteins involved in antigen presentation, adhesion, or activation, again inhibiting the development of the adaptive immune response [43]. Observations of Lassa fever patients demonstrated higher IL-8 and interferon-inducible protein 10 levels in patients who recovered from infection compared to those with fatal outcome [44], which corroborates in vitro studies suggesting that functional impairment of immune responses contributes to pathogenesis. However, given the ability of runaway immune responses to cause an immunopathology or a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d-like disease following infection by some viruses, immune mechanisms need to be appropriate and controlled to allow the development of the correct responses and lead to clearance of the virus. In the case of SARS coronavirus, a microarray study demonstrated that early induction of host responses and proinflammatory signaling was correlated with a fatal outcome of infection in aged mice [45]. Two attenuated variants of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a Bunyavirus and category A priority pathogen, have also provided insights into how differences in viral genome, host interactions, and pathogenesis can identify important viral virulence determinants. The NSs protein mediates the inhibition of the type-I interferon response, a critical mediator of the innate response to viral infection important in establishing appropriate secondary immune developments. The clone 13 strain of RVFV has a large deletion in the NSs coding region, removing its ability to inhibit the type-I interferon response, which leads to a highly attenuated phenotype in mice, but retains immunogenicity, and is a potential candidate vaccine [46\u201349].",

As datasets from global host-pathogen interaction studies continue to become available, novel meta-analyses at the systems level may allow particular patterns associated with pathogen, host, and disease pathology to be observed, which can feed back into models for vaccine development. At present, most studies are concentrating on the innate immune response, in particular the interferon signaling pathway, rather than the adaptive immune response. The major difficulty of all these studies is undertaking studies on wild-type virulent virus in human cells due to biocontainment requirements for studies in cell culture and animal models, while studies in humans are very hard to undertake as patient samples do not usually become available until late in the disease course or from deceased individuals.",

Importantly, these levels of increased understanding will be beneficial to many areas of research, including vaccinology, as we will ultimately be able to screen vaccine candidates based on the effects on particular host genes and/or proteins following infection (e.g., lack of inhibition of interferon signaling pathway) of a particular cell type, and later in appropriate animal models, with the vaccine candidates.",

In this way, transcripts with similar expression characteristics will collect in the same cluster. If gene expression analysis is used to compare the cellular responses following infection with mock, wild-type and attenuated or candidate vaccine strain viruses, groups of genes that may be specifically up or downregulated by a particular virus variant, will become apparent. These genes may be selected for further investigation using other methods. Figure 1 shows a generic example of the type of output produced following k-means clustering.  As can be seen, the three clusters show groups of genes that are upregulated following wild-type but not attenuated virus infection, genes upregulated as a consequence of both infections, and a cluster of genes which are upregulated by attenuated but not wild-type infection. This latter group of genes may represent those that are required to initiate a protective immune response and indicate potential biomarkers of protection.",

The SVM develops an algorithm that, when given a set of parameters (n) of unknown classification, can be used to predict the class on the basis of the training set.  The SVM transforms the data, places it into n-dimensional space, and attempts to separate the data by class by defining a hyperplane through this \u201cfeature space\u201d (Figure 3). The advantage of these types of methods is that the number of parameters can be tailored to strike a balance between what is experimentally feasible and predictive accuracy. As the number of parameters increases, classification accuracy may improve, but collecting the data may become less feasible experimentally. With training sets constructed from known protein-protein interactions defined experimentally, SVM-based approaches have shown increasing accuracy for predicting these interactions [57\u201359]. Using these approaches, it may be possible to screen large numbers of protein sequences in silico to elucidate amino acid mutations to disrupt protein-protein interactions that may attenuate a virus, such as the single amino acid substitution that significantly attenuated Ebola virus [17].",

Their approach takes advantage of the redundancy of the triplet genetic code and the fact that there is often a codon usage bias, where particular codons are used more or less often to code for a particular amino acid than would be predicted by chance. They developed a computer algorithm that recoded a given amino acid sequence at the genetic level, changing the codon pairs to those which were under-or overrepresented in the wild-type sequence. Their algorithm also included other features such as RNA folding-free energy, a factor shown to be implicated in hostadaptation of influenza virus [61]. By altering codon pair usage, they were able to construct a poliovirus that was attenuated in mice and provided protective immunity [60]. Of particular interest with this type of strategy is that the protein sequence remains unchanged from the wild-type virus.

The live-attenuated yellow fever 17D and the polio Sabin vaccines were developed in this way. However, the attenuated poliovirus vaccine can revert to virulence and has been associated with vaccine-associated poliomyelitis [62]. In recent years, the yellow fever 17D vaccine has caused a number of serious adverse effects with a significant case fatality rate [63\u201365]. Some of these outcomes may be associated with polymorphisms in the CCR5 chemokine receptor and RANTES chemokine genes in some vaccinees [66]. This finding complicates the vaccine safety field. If the vaccine-associated disease is associated with hostpolymorphisms rather than with virus reversion, then determining vaccine safety becomes increasingly complicated and suggests that in the 21st century each vaccine may become restricted to individuals with a particular host genetic background.",

Studies of human responses to the yellow fever vaccine using mRNA microarrays have revealed the immune pathways responsible for protection [29, 69, 70]. Unfortunately, as these studies were performed in human volunteers, there is no directly comparable dataset following exposure to wild-type yellow fever virus infection. As discussed above, this raises one of the problems of utilizing system biology in vaccine development; namely, studies with candidate and licensed vaccines in humans are comparatively easy while obtaining samples from wild-type infections and serious adverse events are very difficult for a variety of reasons. However, these studies do reveal significant insights at the molecular level into how a historically very successful vaccine induces protection. These studies showed activation of several arms of the immune response but identified key transcription factors which acted as \u201cmaster switches\u201d in immune response development. Pathway analysis revealed these to be central \u201chubs\u201d: highly connected \u201cnodes\u201d in a signaling network. There are a number of biodefense vaccines in Investigation New Drug (IND) Status, due to limited studies on safety and efficacy, which are administered to individuals who are at risk from the disease. Bioinformatic studies on vaccinees who receive these IND vaccines may help generate important data that have application to safety and efficacy.",

Microarray studies characterizing the global host responses to the adjuvants alum, CpG, MF59, and LTK63 have identified transcript signatures common between and specific to these adjuvants [71, 72]. By understanding how these transcriptional responses correlate with the development of specific immune mechanisms, appropriate pathways could be stimulated with specific vaccines to induce the appropriate immune effector functions for that pathogen: as efforts to design vaccines to be as safe as possible continue, a potential side effect could be over-attenuation leading to increased safety at the expense of immunogenicity and lasting protection. A possible solution could be the use of novel adjuvants to stimulate the signaling pathways associated with a strong immunogenic response. As an example, inflammasome activation was found to be a central regulator of the immune response to yellow fever vaccine [69]. Interestingly, a novel nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery method has recently been reported which includes lipopolysaccharide to activate the inflammasome alongside delivery of a protein subunit vaccine [73]. Combining findings such as these will be central to future themes of vaccinology. As our understanding of the correlates of protection for currently licensed vaccines increases, we may be able to target specific cellular pathways to tailor immune responses to a new generation of highly attenuated, safe vaccines.",

One such database has collected over 300 protein sequences from pathogenic arenaviruses to aid in epitope discovery studies [74].

The ability to perform meta-analyses across different studies could allow a better understanding of what host responses are required to lead to a long-lasting protective immune response.
