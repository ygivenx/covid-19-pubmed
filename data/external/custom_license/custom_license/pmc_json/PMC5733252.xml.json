            "text": "Diarrhoea in dogs is a common occurrence with a myriad of causes (Hubbard et al., 2007) which if not promptly and properly treated could have fatal outcome. Canine Parvovirus (CPV) is considered by many researchers as the leading cause of diarrhoea in dogs under 6 months old (Hackett and Lappin, 2003; Prittie, 2004, Yesilbag et al., 2007, Schulz et al., 2008). Other clinical signs associated with CPV include acute vomiting, anorexia, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, dehydration and depression (Mitchell, 2015). However, not all dogs with CPV enteritis present with bloody diarrhoea or leukopenia. Furthermore, other diseases such as enteropathogenic bacterial infection, parasitic infection, coronavirus or rotavirus infections are possible differentials to CPV (Nahat et al., 2015). For the diagnosis of CPV, use of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly recommended to be used on faecal samples with accompanying histopathology and immunohistochemistry on necropsy specimens, however, in a poor resource setting, a rapid CPV Antigen test kit may be employed especially in dogs with diarrhoea.",

The Government Veterinary Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana is one of such clinics where there have been several cases of morbidity and mortality in dogs due to suspected CPV in both CPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs with no diagnostic tests performed to confirm the disease.

From this study, Rottweiler breed was found to be most susceptible breed to CPV infection in comparison to other breeds presented during the study period. This agrees with earlier reports where Rottweiler and Doberman Pinscher breeds were indicated to be more susceptible to the development of CPV disease (Glickman et al., 1985; Houston et al., 1996). However, some workers have reported higher prevalence in German Shepherd breed (Kumar et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2013; Shima et al., 2015).

This further strengthens the notion of most clinicians in Ghana that the local breeds of dogs and hybrids of exotic and local breeds (mongrels) are less susceptible to CPV infection. Though the status of CPV in local dogs in West Africa is relatively scanty in literature, studies from Nigeria recorded 1 out of 17 (5.56%) of the local breeds positive for CPV as compared to 11 out of 41 (21.15%) of the exotic breeds (Ogbu et al., 2016) while Shima et al. (2015) in a retrospective study from 2000 to 2013 reported the highest cases of CPV in local breeds of dogs and mongrels.

The high prevalence of CPV infection in dogs less than 6 months old could be due to interference of maternal antibodies, improper vaccination protocol, lack of maternal immunity and poor efficiency of the immune system of puppies (Klingborg et al., 2002, Umar et al., 2015).",

This corresponds with the findings of Singh et al., (2013) who had a prevalence of 64% in unvaccinated dogs and 50% vaccinated dogs. There was no dependence of the vaccination status of the dogs on the susceptibility to CPV infection in this study. This was similar to work done by Miranda et al. (2015) who found vaccination status not to be a risk factor for CPV infection but was in variance with recent work done by Ogbu et al. (2016), implying a dependence of vaccination status on the susceptibility to CPV infection validating the claim that vaccinated dogs are protected against CPV. The high percentage of positive cases in vaccinated dogs in this study could be as a result of irregular vaccination or the use of improperly maintained vaccines (Singh et al., 2013). The prevailing energy crises (unstable electricity) in Ghana could account for improper storage of the vaccines (break in the cold chain), rendering them inefficacious. Decaro et al. (2007) in their study found out that most clinical cases of CPV occurring shortly after vaccination are not as a result of reversion to virulence of the MLVs in the vaccines but are rather related to infection with field strains. Worthy of note therefore is the possible strain difference in the vaccine virus and those circulating on the field, this possible difference calls for characterization of CPV field isolates in Ghana. Also previously infected pens without proper disinfection could therefore serve as source of infection to puppies even before vaccination begins.",

However, dogs presented with haemorrhagic diarrhoea had a higher prevalence of 69.05% as compared to 50.0% dogs without haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Mosallanejad et al. (2008) reported similar findings. This particular finding is very important to note, particularly in Ghana where most clinicians rely on the presence of profuse foul-smelling watery bloody diarrhoea as the main clinical sign to tentatively diagnose CPV. This study showed that absence of bloody diarrhoea may not be often presumed to be CPV negative. ",

It also revealed that breed and age of dogs had influence on the susceptibility to CPV with Rottweilers and Boerboels being the most susceptible breeds and puppies below 6 months being most susceptible age group. Vaccinated dogs could still be susceptible to CPV infection. CPV is detected in dogs presented with bloody diarrhoea as well as in dogs without bloody diarrhoea, hence absence of foul-smelling bloody diarrhoea should not be the indicator to rule out CPV in dogs.",
