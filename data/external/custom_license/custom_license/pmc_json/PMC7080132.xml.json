A suspect case is disease in a person with documented fever (temperature >38 \u00b0C), one or more respiratory tract symptoms (including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing), and close contact with a person believed to have had SARS (living with, caring for, or having had direct contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms, exposure to respiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a person with SARS) and/or a history of travel (within 10 days of onset of SARS symptoms) to an endemic geographic area with documented foci of illness transmission. A probable case is defined as a suspect case with chest radiographic findings of pneumonia, acute severe respiratory distress, or an unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death with autopsy results demonstrating the pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome without an identifiable cause. Probable cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often have a more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, as well as radiographic signs of atypical pneumonia [13, 14, 15].",

However, dyspnea, malaise, and hypoxemia are less commonly encountered in childhood. The typical pediatric presentation is rapid onset of high fever with cough. Compared with adults, children with SARS seem to have a milder clinical course, especially for those under the age of 10 years [26, 33].",

Many children that were initially suspected of having SARS were eventually excluded upon availability of the results of standard microbiologic investigations. For example, at one institution (Toronto) we had ten children present with clinical and epidemiological criteria consistent with a diagnosis of suspect or probable SARS, but who were later shown to have other infections. These other infections included viral respiratory tract infections such as adenovirus, influenza (A and B), parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus and bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Further, using the current criteria, there are likely to be false-negative cases as well. Some children may be inappropriately thought not to have SARS due to our incomplete knowledge of the full extent of SARS clinical presentations, especially at the early or mild stage of the disease. A few adult close contacts have reported a mild, febrile illness without definite respiratory signs or symptoms suggesting that the illness might not always primarily involve the respiratory tract. This appears to be true in children as well, with some in our study having minimal or no clear respiratory symptoms and a nonspecific febrile illness despite extensive contact history [33]. Although gastrointestinal symptoms are usually absent, some children reported vomiting and/or diarrhea [22, 26, 33], while several adults have presented solely with severe abdominal pain. The relative infectivity of these patients remains unclear and until more is learned, caution and full infection control procedures are recommended.",

We did not consider mild peribronchial thickening as pneumonia and these children were classified as suspect SARS. As in adults, regions of airspace disease predominated in the lower lobes, especially peripherally, but were also seen elsewhere. Distinguishing between atelectasis and consolidation can be difficult in daily practice. Areas of segmental atelectasis are common in viral disease and may often be multiple and fleeting. Adenopathy, infrequently encountered with viral diseases [40], was not seen in our patients. With clinical recovery, complete clearing of chest radiographs were noted in our patients similar to other reports [35, 36].

We did not observe any of the less common features such as the crazy paving pattern or septal thickening. CT scans were obtained at one site only and were generally used to document early lung findings when the initial chest radiograph was normal or equivocal and suspicion for SARS was high. CT scans of the pediatric chest are not routinely needed in evaluation of lower respiratory tract infection, but are generally reserved for investigation of suspected complications including pulmonary abscess, empyema, pulmonary necrosis, recurrent infection, or in immunocompromised individuals [42]. Since the clinical presentation in most of our pediatric cases was mild, CT was not considered necessary in two sites (Toronto and Singapore). For the Hong Kong patients (PWH and PMH patient cohort), chest CT was used for patients with suspected SARS but with normal chest radiographs, patients with a moderate to severe clinical course of the disease, and patients without contact history. Use of CT may be justified if management depends upon positive lung findings; however, suspect SARS patients were also admitted and managed in a similar fashion to those with positive chest radiograph findings. It is still unclear whether the infectivity of suspect SARS patients is similar to or decreased relative to those with positive radiographic findings.",

These findings were not encountered in our patient population, with exception of one patient with a small pleural effusion (Table 1, probable case no. 10). Many patients were initially clinically thought to have tuberculosis or other infections, but the lack of radiographic findings such as adenopathy, cavitation, or pleural effusion may aid in suggesting SARS or assist in excluding other disorders. Recognition of the presence of radiographic changes which are atypical for SARS, such as adenopathy and significant pleural effusion, may help to guide therapy as well as show the need for isolation. Once the association with travel or case contact is lost in a community, clinical and radiographic recognition of the disease will become increasingly important especially if rapid diagnostic tests remain unavailable.",

Data from Hong Kong have shown the potential of SARS-associated coronavirus to persist in stool or urine of SARS patients and maintain its viability on various contact surfaces for extended periods [45]. Health-care workers are particularly at high risk, and there is potential for infection in the radiology department. We recommend extreme vigilance in application of infection control practices. Further, the use of portable techniques in the ward, where a child can be maintained in proper isolation, helps to minimize the risk of SARS virus transmission to staff and other patients.",

Cleansing of all radiographic equipment and rooms is important and consideration must be given to ensuring safe patient flow [41]. Training and audit of inappropriate use of infection control measures have been documented as significant factors leading to health-care worker transmission. Other factors include failure to apply appropriate isolation precautions to known SARS cases or cases which have not yet been identified as SARS and, finally, infected workers continuing to work despite infection.

Limiting diagnosis to contact with a known case, although a valuable criterion, can lead to false-positive and false-negative cases especially as the disease spreads into the broader community [26]. Community spread has not been identified in Toronto and Singapore; however, Hong Kong has encountered this problem at PWH and PMH where three RT-PCR confirmed SARS cases were reported without definite contact history.
