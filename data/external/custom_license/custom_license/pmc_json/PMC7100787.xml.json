While some important causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are commensals of the upper respiratory tract, other viral and bacterial agents are considered to be regular pathogens and their detection from a clinical specimen is considered as proof of infection. These include enterovirus (EV), influenza virus type A (IVA) and type B (IVB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1), type 2 (PIV2), type 3 (PIV3), and type 4 (PIV4), adenovirus (AV), rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), coronavirus (CV), reovirus (RV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpn), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (Cpn), Bordetella pertussis (Bp), Bordetella parapertussis (Bpp), and Legionella pneumophila (Lpn). For these, molecular amplification techniques are advantageous as compared to culture techniques, because the results are available earlier, lower cost, and higher sensitivity. Moreover, the diagnostic laboratory handling of viable pathogens is not required.",

            "text": "Target sequences or regions for amplification were predominantly selected from the literature, and, if necessary, adapted for the multiplex PCR protocol (Tables 1, 2, and 3). The procedure of m-RT-PCR was as follows: 4.5 \u00b5l of the nucleic acid preparations from specimens were included in the reverse transcription (RT) reaction in a final volume of 15 \u00b5l (10.5 \u00b5l RT buffer + 4.5 \u00b5l template). The setup of buffer for 15 reactions (nine specimens plus controls) was as follows: 51 \u00b5l first strand buffer [5\u00d7 conc.] (Invitrogen), 77 \u00b5l dNTP [10 mM] (Amersham), 25.5 \u00b5l DTT [0.1 M] (Invitrogen), 12.8 \u00b5l hexanucleotide mixture [10\u00d7 conc.] (Roche Diagnostika), 6.4 \u00b5l RNAsin [40 U/\u00b5l] (Promega), and 6.4 \u00b5l SuperScript II [200 U/\u00b5l] (Invitrogen). The RT was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, followed by 50 min at 42 \u00b0C and 5 min at 90 \u00b0C, and then finally chilled to 4 \u00b0C. The RT and PCR were performed on a BioRad iCycler (BioRad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) or a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600 Thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer, Branchburg, NJ, USA). For the PCR, the AccuPrime\u2122 Taq DNA Polymerase System (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used. The PCR was performed in parallel in two tubes containing Primer Mix A and Mix B, respectively. Primers and concentrations used in the mix are given in Table 1 and the sequences are shown in Table 2. The setup of PCR mixtures for 15 reactions was performed on ice as follows. Mix A: 394 \u00b5l nuclease-free water (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 68 \u00b5l PCR buffer I (AccuPrime System, Invitrogen), 27 \u00b5l Primer Mix A, 13.6 \u00b5l AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), and 6.8 \u00b5l of digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), and for Mix B 2/3 of the volumes: 263 \u00b5l nuclease-free water, 45 \u00b5l PCR buffer I, 18 \u00b5l Primer Mix B, 9.1 \u00b5l AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), and 4.5 \u00b5l of digoxigenin-11-dUTP. 20 \u00b5l of this Mix B were transferred to 14 new PCR tubes each and 6 \u00b5l of the c-DNA from the 15-\u00b5l RT reaction were added as the PCR template. 30 \u00b5l of Mix A were added to the remaining (9 \u00b5l) c-DNA from each RT tube. The protocol for the PCR was: 2 min activation at 94 \u00b0C and, afterwards, 35 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 20 s, 72 \u00b0C for 40 s, followed by one final extension for 10 min at 72 \u00b0C and a cooling step to 4 \u00b0C. The ramping times were adjusted as follows: 36 s for heating from 55 to 94 \u00b0C, 25 s for cooling from 94 to 55 \u00b0C, and 31 s for heating from 55 to 72 \u00b0C. The performance of this m-RT-PCR is optimal using the AccuPrime System (Invitrogen) and other enzymes or a different thermocycler may need adaptation. Especially, the ramping times of thermocyclers may be different and should be controlled.\n\n\n",

Since the single primer RT-PCR ELISA showed a tenfold higher sensitivity for PIV1 as compared to the multiplex approach, one must assume that the reduced sensitivity is based on the use in the multiplex approach rather than on the design of primers itself.

The extended m-RT-PCR uses the hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase gene as target sequences for PIV1 and PIV3, and the latter gave comparable results in analytical sensitivity to culture.

Nevertheless, the high frequency at which RV was identified from nasopharyngeal specimens of infants and young children admitted to our hospitals with ARI suggests a causative correlation of the agent and the observed ARI symptoms. More definite support for considering RV as a \u201ctrue ARI pathogen\u201d comes from the fact that in situ hybridization has demonstrated that RV may trigger inflammatory processes in infected cells and tissues [37].

            "text": "Evidence of the simultaneous detection of nucleic acids from two or more pathogens within one specimen from children with ARI was observed by m-RT-PCR in 13.4 % of all specimens, and the simultaneous detections were most frequently with CV, AV, EV, and Bp. Simultaneous detections have also been observed by others using molecular techniques in a multiplex format [4, 7, 38\u201341]. However, the results of simultaneous detections have to be judged with care, because m-RT-PCR, like other \u201cnon-quantitative\u201d PCR-based techniques, only detect fragments of nucleic acids. Thus, a positive PCR result only allows the conclusion that a specific part of the genome of a pathogen was present. It is not possible to draw conclusions about the viability of the respective pathogens. Quantitative PCR assays have the advantage of calculating the amount of pathogens present in specimens (only roughly for respiratory specimens) and may give additional guidance to judge whether the pathogen is, in fact, responsible for the infection. In specimens, e.g., from the lower respiratory tract, which may contain encapsulated material, it is possible that non-viable pathogens from earlier infections are present. Also, some pathogens, such as adenoviruses, may persist in the airways for a long time without causing disease.",
