Among the four surfactant proteins (SP-B, SP-C, SP-A, SP-D) the both last ones play as collectins an important role in host defense mechanisms of the lung [10, 11]. They bind and agglutinate various microorganisms and pathogen-derived components, act as opsonins and may possess direct inhibitory effects on bacterial growth. Furthermore, SP-A and SP-D operate with immune cells, activate various cellular functions, and regulate inflammatory cellular responses by associating with cell surface pattern-recognition receptors [10, 11]. It was found that the collectins enhance the clearance of PA by stimulating alveolar macrophages to phagocyte PA and modulate the inflammatory response in the lungs [12].",

            "text": "The transmembrane glycoprotein CD26/DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) is expressed on epithelia and endothelia, as well as on lymphocytes and occurs as a soluble form. The second highest expression of CD26/DPP4 was found in lungs [14, 15]. CD26/DPP4 is involved in inflammatory processes, because its dipeptidyl peptidase activity cleaves paracrine chemokines such as Rantes (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), stromal cell-derived factor, eotaxin and macrophage-derived chemokine [14, 15]. Interestingly, NH2 terminal truncation of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (CXCL6) does not alter the chemotactic activity of neutrophils. NH2 terminal processing of an isoform of macrophage inflammatory peptide 1 \u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1) increases the chemotactic activity [16]. Furthermore, CD26/DPP4 induces T cell co-stimulation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production [17]. So co-stimulated T cells may have a particular role in acquired immune reactions, such as antigen specific host defense against different diseases such as infection [18]. Additionally, soluble CD26 enhanced transendothelial T cell migration [19]. There is an association between the degree of inflammation and CD26/DPP4 expression [20]. Using CD26/DPP4 inhibitors in a lung ischemia/reperfusion model, predominantly a significant improvement of gas exchange, a better preservation of parenchymal ultrastructure and reduced neutrophil infiltration were found [21]. Furthermore, application of an CD26/DPP4 inhibitor decreased serum DPP4 activity, BAL protein concentration, cell number and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and reduced pathological histological findings of lung injury such as edema, neutrophil invasion and disruption of lung tissue in LPS challenged mice lungs [22]. Moreover, a reduced inflammation of lung parenchyma combined with a reduced airway specific recruitment of T-cells [23] and decreased expression of surfactant proteins was found in asthma induced CD26/DPP4 deficient (DPP4/CD26\u2212) rats compared to CD26/DPP4 positive rats (wild types) [24].",

Thinning of alveolar epithelium up to denudation of the basement membrane, epithelial fragmentation and constrictions (\u2018blebbing\u2019) were often visible as signs of epithelial damage (Fig. 5a\u2013d). Protein rich edema partly containing germs covered damaged alveolar epithelium frequently.

Active and inactive intraalveolar surfactant formations were partly associated with germs (Fig. 6c, d). So PA was found within unilamellar (inactive subtypes) and multilamellar vesicles as well as within tubular myelin (active subtypes). Not infrequently surfactant subtypes and germs were covered with alveolar edematous fluid (Fig. 6c, d). The alveoli were partly filled with indefineable cell debris (Fig. 7a). Alveolar macrophages containing numerous PA partly in apparently dissolving cytoplasm occurred sporadically in the alveolar space (Fig. 7b). In places, the structural integrity of the alveolar septum was abolished (Fig. 7c). A crossing of bacteria in capillaries appeared very rarely. The alveolar space revealed not only alveolar macrophages but also neutrophils containing phagocytosed germs (Fig. 7d).",

The used dose caused a pronounced clinical picture. We classified the rats\u2019 condition independent of the genotype as moderately troubled 2 h after instillation and as profoundly disturbed 6 h after instillation, indicating that the animals could not cope sufficiently with the infection. Therefore, we stopped the experiment there, sacrificed the rats and analyzed their lungs. The high CFU numbers implicate a strong bacterial proliferation in the lungs, which obviously could not be controlled by the defense system, although we saw a lot of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils with engulfed bacteria, indeed partly destroyed. Neutrophils are crucial in host immune defense against PA-infections [36]. The used strain TBCF10839 is able to sustain phagocytosis by neutrophils and is even able to proliferate within immune cells [37]. However, bacterial division stages in defense cells were not clearly visible, probably because the normally exponential bacterial growth gets to the stationary phase. The bacteria had not been digested in the defense cells, which is in accordance with phagocytosis experiments with isolated leucocytes, in which the non-piliated PA survived in phagosomes and, furthermore, disrupted the phagosomal membrane, grew and divided in the cytoplasm, which was proved by electron microscopy [5].",

Chi et al. demonstrated that piliated bacteria bind better to A549 cells and survive longer within intracellular membrane bound vacuoles than non-piliated bacteria, which are rapidly killed and digested after internalization [38].

Of note, a remarkable systemic spread of bacteria into liver and spleen with numbers even higher than in the lung occurred, suggesting an early and rapid transfer in the blood (septicemia). Taken together, we found germs in the alveolar and bronchial space as well as in defense cells, but neither clearly in the alveolar septa, nor in the peribronchial or perivascular space, nor in the capillaries or vessels. Although we used the systematic random sampling method to guarantee that each part of the lung has an equal chance of being evaluated and scrutinized ultrastructurally ultra-thin sections of numerous tissue blocks. One possible explanation for the missing structural correlate may be a very fast crossing of bacteria and a very short retention period of germs in blood vessels caused additionally by increased blood flow during exsanguination. An additional washout of intravascular bacteria may be caused by cutting the lung into slices and blocks as a result of squeezing.",

Moreover, thinning and loss of continuity of alveolar septa combined with epithelial damage limited the gas exchange capacity. Interestingly, we determined an increase in septal surface at unchanged septal volume indicating an abolition of septal continuity, not visible in other PA infection models [5, 6, 8, 39\u201343]. Thus, the infective dose as well as the selected PA strain and its virulence factors influence the degree of inflammation as well as structural alterations. The used PA strain has a fully functional Type III secretion system, which enables to express and secrete different exotoxins such as ExoS, ExoT, ExoU and ExoY [36] as well as the Type II secretion system, elastase, LPS, lipid A, and O-polysaccharid (O-Antigen) [5]. The alveolar edema may be the morphological consequence of an increased permeability of the alveolar epithelial barrier caused by exoenzyme S (ExoS). So 8 h after instillation of ExoS producing PA mutants not only a dissemination in the blood occurred, but also a significant increase in lung water [39]. Additionally, cell\u2013cell-interactions, especially tight-junctions, may be opened by lysis of proteins of the occludin- and claudin-group, which are necessary for junctional stability [44, 45]. ExoS-expressing strains changed the distribution of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin and were able to transmigrate across polarized airway epithelial monolayers [46].",

However, we saw areas with predominantly unilamellar vesicles (Fig. 4c), as such with tubular myelin (Fig. 6d), but did not determine the subtypes quantitatively. In vitro studies have shown that the incubation of surfactant with protease IV affects the biophysical function of surfactant [53]. So incubating surface tension lowering large aggregates (tubular myelin, lamellar body like vesicles) obtained from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) with PA protease IV inhibited the surface tension-lowering function of LA [53]. Because of the additionally described degradation of SP-B [51], the lipid adsorption to the air\u2013liquid interface may be restricted and surface tension increased, leading more frequently to alveolar collapse and problems with breathing as seen in the infected groups.",

SP-D, isolated from the lavage fluid of silica-treated rats, significantly enhanced the uptake of different strains of PA by rat alveolar macrophages seen by means of both fluorescence and electron microscopy [56]. Studies with collectin-knockout mice showed that phagocytosis of bacteria by alveolar macrophages was decreased 6 h after infection compared with wild types [12]. Our molecular biological studies with only small sample numbers showed no infection or genotype dependent changes in collectin gene expression 6 h after infection. Because of the high standard deviation using three animals per group already a justifiable increase of animals would not led to significant alterations. We assume that a PA induced expression immediately after infection was followed by an increased instability of collectin mRNA induced by PA secretion products or synthesis exhaustion so that 6 h after infection an increased gene expression is not detectable. The elevated SP-A levels in both genotypes might be the result of an increased protein expression. However, a statistical test was not possible because of the small sample numbers. The SP-D values were in the same range in all groups. The lack of significant differences in the SP content could as well be due to the degradation of collectins by PA secreted virulence factors as already described by others. So PA elastase degrades SP-A and, therefore, reduced the phagocytosis of the bacteria in mouse lungs [57]. Furthermore, SP-D is also modified by elastase leading to a 35kD fragment, in which the degree of degradation depends on dose, time and temperature [58]. The 35kD fragment was not detectable in our blots, may be because the concentration was still too low. Additionally, incubation of cell-free BALF with PA protease IV resulted in degradation of both collectins [53].",

They found (1) a CD26 mediated costimulation of T-cells combined with production of the proinflammatory interleukin-2 (IL-2) [59], (2) a CD26 mediated co-stimulation of CD8+ T cells, which exert cytotoxic effects predominantly via TNF-\u03b1 [18], (3) a DPP4 dependent cleavage of the chemokine substrate LD78\u00df into a very efficient monocyte attractant, enhancing lymphocyte and monocyte chemotactic activity [60], and (4) a CD26/DPP4-inhibitor dependent increase of the anti-inflammatory peptide VIP (Vasointestinal peptide) in rats [61], diminishing inflammatory response [15, 21]. Furthermore, using different CD26/DPP4 inhibitors signs of inflammation were reduced in different lung disease models [22, 62, 63]. Not at all, our group found a reduced inflammation in CD26/DPP4\u2212 rats [24]. CD26/DPP4 deficiency caused less pronounced recruitment of activated T-lymphocytes and eosinophils [24], less pronounced neutrophil alveolar invasion [64] and influenced cleavage of different cytokines thereby affecting the inflammatory response as well [14].",
