This so-called REGIOTYPE strategy contributed to timely detection of EV-D68 in our hospital in 2014, as well as in 2016.

Clades are according to Tokarz et al. and Gong et al (7,8). We submitted the 20 sequences we obtained during 2016 to GenBank under accession nos.: KX685066\u2013KX685084 and KX710328. CHN, China; DNK, Denmark; ESP, Spain; FIN, Finland; FRA, France; GER, Germany; IRL, Ireland; ITA, Italy; NLD, the Netherlands; SVN, Slovenia; USA, United States. White circles indicate reference strains (n = 2).",
