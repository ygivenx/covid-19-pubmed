A comparison of the amino acid sequences of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 spike protein and BCoV spike protein showed 81 aa polymorphisms, of which 24 were seen within the region previously identified as hypervariable among the spike protein of other betacoronavirus lineage A CoVs (31) (Figure 2); this finding suggests that this region in DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is also subject to strong immune selection. BCoV has been found to use N-acetyl-9-Oacetyl neuramic acid as a receptor for initiation of infection (32). Among the 5 aa that may affect S1-mediated receptor binding in BCoV (31), 2 aa (threonine at position 11 and glutamine at position 179) were conserved in DcCoV UAE-HKU23 (Figure 2). However, at positions 115, 118, and 173, aspartic acid, methionine, and asparagine observed in BCoV and were replaced by serine, threonine, and histidine, respectively, in DcCoV UAE-HKU23. A recent report identified 4 aa acids that were critical sugar-binding residues in the spike protein of BCoV (tyrosine, glutamic acid, tryptophan, and histidine at positions 162, 182, 184, and 185, respectively) (32); all 4 aa were also present in spike protein of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 (Figure 2). Another study identified 7 aa substitutions in the spike protein of BCoV that differed between virulent and avirulent, cell culture-adapted strains (31); 5 of the 7 aa from virulent strains were also conserved in DcCoV UAE-HKU23, and amino acid substitutions were observed in the other 2 aa (threonine\ufffd+'valine at position 40 and aspartic acid\ufffd+'asparagine at position 470). It has also been reported that an amino acid change at position 531 of the spike protein of BCoV discriminated between enteric (aspartic acid/asparagine) and respiratory (glycine) strains (33). At this position, a threonine was conserved in all 3 genomes of DcCoV UAE-HKU23.",

In our study, 21.3% of dromedary calves, but only 0.4% of adult dromedaries, were RT-PCR positive for DcCoV UAE-HKU23; this finding indicates that dromedary calves are probably more susceptible than adult dromedaries to infection with DcCoV UAE-HKU23. Furthermore, DcCoV UAE-HKU23 is probably stably evolving in dromedaries because the Ka/Ks of all the coding regions in the genome were <0.5. In this study, 4 of the 12 positive samples were collected from dromedaries with diarrhea. A previous report also described the presence of a betacoronavirus in the fecal sample of a dromedary calf with diarrhea (35).

Because we showed an extremely high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in the serum samples by Western blot analysis, indirect immunofluorescence, and neutralization antibody testing, concurring with findings in a previous study (24), we would also expect a similar high prevalence of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 antibodies if there was major serologic cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and DcCoV UAE-HKU23. However, our serologic data only revealed the presence of DcCoV UAE-HKU23 antibodies in 52% of the serum samples, indicating that no correlation exists between seropositivity to DcCoV UAE-HKU23 and seropositivity to MERS-CoV.
