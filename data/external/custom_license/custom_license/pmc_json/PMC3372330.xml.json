            "text": "One of the most intriguing puzzles in modern immunology involves the \"paradox of pregnancy,\" in which immunologic tolerance to paternally derived fetal antigens is achieved despite an apparently adequate maternal defense against infection. With 50% of its genetic material derived from its father, the fetus's susceptibility to rejection by the maternal immune system is similar to the susceptibility of a transplanted organ. Evidence indicates that the maternal immune system may tolerate fetal antigens by suppressing cell-mediated immunity while retaining normal humoral immunity. These changes are known to occur locally at the maternal-fetal interface but may also affect systemic immune responses to infection. Although pregnant women are not immunosuppressed in the classic sense, immunologic changes of pregnancy may induce a state of increased susceptibility to certain intracellular pathogens, including viruses, intracellular bacteria, and parasites.",

On the fetal side of the interface, the placenta and membranes enclose the fetus and are derived entirely from fetal tissue. Forming a specialized epithelial surface within the placenta, fetal syncytiotrophoblast cells directly contact maternal blood for nutrient exchange. On the maternal side of the interface, the uterine tissue in contact with the placenta and fetal membranes, the decidua, is rich in specialized maternal immune cells including lymphocytes and macrophages (2). Despite the prolonged direct exposure of decidual leukocytes and maternal blood to fetal antigens, the immune system does not recognize the fetus as foreign. Several mechanisms underlie this maternal tolerance of fetal tissues.",

Most effective against extracellular pathogens, humoral immunity is essential for fighting many bacterial infections. The bacteria become coated in antibodies, which then mediate uptake of the pathogens by phagocytic cells, including neutrophils and macrophages. Presentation of the bacterial antigens on the surface of the macrophage then stimulates B lymphocytes specific to the pathogen, and the B cells produce more antibodies to control the infection. This humoral immune response is augmented by T-helper type II (Th2) lymphocytes, which provide costimulation and induce replication of the B cells. The Th2 response during pregnancy results in vigorous antibody-mediated immunity to pathogens (2).",

In contrast to humoral immunity, this arm of the immune response is stimulated by T-helper type I (Th1) lymphocytes and the cytokines they release. The most important effectors of the cell-mediated immune response, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are the main immune cells that recognize foreign antigens on the surface of infected \"self\" cells. Cells infected with viruses or other intracellular pathogens are cytotoxic T lymphocytes' most common targets. The cell-mediated immune response is critical for controlling such pathogens because their intracellular location shelters them from antibody binding.",

Multiple factors, including the cytokine environment and costimulatory molecules present during activation of the T-helper cell, determine the development of either Th1- or Th2-helper phenotype. One hypothesis is that, in addition to hormonal factors that affect the Th1-Th2 balance, macrophages present at the maternal-fetal interface release predominantly Th2-stimulating cytokines and contribute to the overall dominance of humoral immunity during pregnancy (3). In addition to stimulating B lymphocytes, Th2 cells suppress the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, decreasing the robustness of cell-mediated immunity. In the uterine decidua, the Th2 cytokine environment favors activation of B lymphocytes, resulting in stimulation of antibody secretion and suppression of cell-mediated immunity (3). This phenomenon is often referred to as the Th1-Th2 shift of pregnancy and is thought to contribute to maternal tolerance of the fetus by suppressing the antifetal cell-mediated immune response.",

That the local Th1-Th2 shift may also influence the systemic maternal immune response during pregnancy is evidenced in pregnant patients with autoimmune disorders. Women with rheumatoid arthritis, a predominantly cell-mediated autoimmune disorder, tend to experience remissions during pregnancy (4). Similarly, patients with multiple sclerosis have fewer exacerbations while pregnant but worsening symptoms during the postpartum period (5). Systemic lupus erythematosis, however, a predominantly antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder, often worsens during pregnancy, perhaps due to increased immunoglobulin synthesis and decreased clearance of immune complexes resulting from robust Th2 activity (3,6). These well-studied changes in severity of autoimmune disorders during pregnancy illustrate systemic immune alterations that occur in conjunction with the Th1-Th2 shift. Systemic suppression of cell-mediated immunity may contribute to increased susceptibility to some intracellular pathogens\u2014including viruses, bacteria, and parasites\u2014during pregnancy.",

The increased incidence and severity of malaria may occur especially in primiparous women. Although parasite density is highest in nonimmune women during their first pregnancy, even a previously immune woman can become more susceptible to malaria infection during pregnancy (7). In a 14-year follow-up study of women of reproductive age (15\u201345 years) in 1 area of the Gambia, McGregor and Smith found a higher prevalence of parasitemia among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women (8). Prevalence of infection and parasite density are highest during the first half of pregnancy and decline gradually during the second half (7).",

A cross-sectional study of 2,242 women in Brazil showed that previous pregnancy was a risk factor for serologic evidence of prior infection with toxoplasmosis (11). In a follow-up prospective cohort study, the same investigators found that pregnant women who were seronegative for Toxoplasma were more than twice as likely as nonpregnant women to seroconvert; acute infection developed in 8.6% of pregnant women (12). These findings are consistent with animal data showing that pregnant mice have lower resistance to Toxoplasma than nonpregnant control mice (13).",

For example, influenza infections cause more severe illness and higher mortality rates for pregnant women. During the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic, the mortality rate was 27% for pregnant women, higher in the last trimester, and it increased to 50% if pneumonia developed (19). Freeman and Barno reported that during the 1957\u20131958 pandemic, 50% of the deaths from influenza among reproductive-aged women in Minnesota occurred in pregnant women and that influenza was the leading cause of maternal death in Minnesota (20). Increased incidence and severity of illness has also been observed during interpandemic periods. In a review of the Tennessee Medicaid program from 1974 through 1993, pregnant women in their third trimester were 3\u20134 times as likely as postpartum women to be hospitalized for an acute cardiopulmonary condition during influenza season (21). In addition to immunologic changes, other physiologic changes in pregnancy such as increased heart rate, stroke volume, and oxygen consumption, and decreased lung capacity may contribute to this increased risk for illness during pregnancy. Due to the high risk for influenza-related complications, women who will be pregnant during the influenza season should be vaccinated (22).",

However, this agent is increasingly causing infection among immunocompetent persons. A mild or asymptomatic form of P. jiroveci infection occurs in immunocompetent hosts, and this infection may be more common in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. In a small pilot study, nasal swabs from 33 healthy women in their third trimester of pregnancy were compared with those from 28 healthy nonpregnant women. P. jiroveci DNA was isolated from 5 of the pregnant women and none of the nonpregnant women (p = 0.04) (35), which indicates that the immune changes associated with pregnancy may favor asymptomatic nasal carriage of this organism.
