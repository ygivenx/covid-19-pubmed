Many strains of the bacterium are harmless to the calf, but certain strains that acquire virulence genes can cause moderate to severe scours and even death (Wani et al. 2004). Two of the more prominent virulence factors identified for Enterotoxigenic E. coli strains are (i) expression of fimbrial (pilli) antigens that enable the bacteria to adhere to and to colonize the luminal surface of the small bowel and (ii) elaboration of one or more enterotoxins that influence intestinal secretion of fluids (Chen and Franke 2005; Welch 2006).",

The ability to ferment a given sugar of the types described above by a strain of E. coli is dependent on the strain having the requisite enzymes to convert it to glucose or to a substance on the degradative chain from glucose (Aklilu et al. 2013). This is the basis of biotyping of E. coli. These tests are also easy to perform, by determining, whether a strain of E. coli will produce acid following growth in the presence of the carbohydrate. Of the various typing systems available, study of the organisms\u2019 biological properties (\u201cbiotyping\u201d) appears to be a useful method of identification (Aklilu et al. 2013). In this regard, Chattopadhyay et al. (2003) classified six different biotypes of verotoxin-positive E. coli on the basis of sugar fermentation reactions of three sugars, viz., sorbitol, raffinose, dulcitol, and decarboxylase test with lysine, arginine, and ornithine. In addition, Murinda et al. (2004) reported diagnostic significance of rhamnose fermentation test; they recorded rhamnose non-fermenters belonging to E. coli O26 were 100 % STEC producers.",

Accordingly, four types of diarrheal color were identified, the most dominant being the yellowish one (62.7 %) from which 22.9 % were positive for E. coli. In comparison, Bartels et al.

Factors that may contribute to these differences between studies could be related to presence or absence of mixed infections, variations on management conditions of the farms, and the age of the calf as also supported by the present study.

Thus, the isolation rate of E. coli from blood-tinged diarrhea in the present study (9.0 %) was inconsistent with that of James and James (2003), who isolated E. coli from 22 % of blood-tinged calf diarrhea. In support of this, Naylor and Smith (2002) reported that diarrhea due to E. coli is characterized by profuse, pasty to watery, foul smelling, and occasionally flecked with blood (blood-tinged). The isolation rate of E. coli from pure bloody diarrhea in the present study (4.5 %) was consistent with the 7 % reported by James and James (2003). The overall variations in color of feces may be as a result of differences on the basis of pathogenic features and mechanisms of the disease. Exudative diarrhea is observed in inflammatory diseases when mucosal inflammation and ulceration cause outpouring of plasma, mucus, and blood into the stool. Diarrhea of the large intestine is associated with frequent small-volume stools with the presence of blood (Naylor and Smith 2002; Foster and Smith 2009). Involvement of mixed infections could also complicate the appearance of feces (Ata et al. 2013; Cho and Yoon 2014).",

(\n2004) (76 %). The causes of variation might be as a result of variations in management of the farms and immunity of the animals. Most newborn calves are exposed to E. coli from the environment, particularly when sanitation is marginal (Charles et al. 2003). The author stated that young neonates under 1 week of age are particularly susceptible because the normal flora of the intestine is not fully established. In addition to that, they have a naive immune system and also receptors for the adhesions of E. coli are present on the first week of life of the calves (Villarroel 2009). The result of this study is in agreement with the above idea. In addition, other authors reported that this is the age group most commonly affected clinically (Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006; Santin et al. 2004).",

The isolation rates of the bacteria in the subsequent age groups were shown to decrease as supported by the reports of Villarroel (2009). In support of this, calf diarrhea was noted to decrease as the age of the calves increased. This could be due to the poorly developed immune system of the days old calves as compared to older ones to fight against the disease-causing agents (Darsema 2008; Bekele et al. 2009). Scott et al.

An inadequate, in quality and quantity, supply of colostrum and delay in first colostrum feeding, which leads to failure of transfer of passive immunity (FPT) is an important reason. Calves with inadequate colostral immunoglobulin concentration within 24 h of birth were at greater risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality. In addition, FPT could be due to bacterial contamination of the fed colostrum (Keith et al. 2010). Colostrum feeding practices also have effect in that allowing calves to nurse their dam may predispose them to FPT since they consume late and small amount (Meganck et al. 2014).",

Biotyping based on sugar fermentation tests has been utilized by various workers for identifying diversity within a bacterial spp. The most dominant biotype was biotype III (25.7 %) which fermented dulcitol, rhamnose, and inositol. This result was consistent with a report by Gargan et al. (1982) who determined E. coli biotyping using the same type of sugars. They assigned biotype I as an isolate fermenting the above three sugars, which accounted 66.6 % of the isolates, and based on the API 20E system, they concluded that the identified biotype I confirmed with serotyping was ETEC containing O-antigen. So according to their data, biotype III of the present study could be ETEC (entherotoxigenic E. coli). Chattopadhyay et al. (2003) classified six different biotypes verotoxin-positive E. coli on the basis of sugar fermentation reactions in three sugars, viz., sorbitol, raffinose, dulcitol, and decarboxylase test with lysine, arginine, and ornithine. In addition, Murinda et al. (2004) reported diagnostic significance of rhamnose fermentation test; they recorded rhamnose non-fermenters belonging to E. coli O26 were 100 % STEC producers. The current study identified 12 different biotypes. Dawit (2012) reported 15 biotypes based on 6 sugars (dulcitol, raffinose, rhamnose, salicin, starch, and sucrose) in the central part of Ethiopia. Their data showed that the biotype that fermented dulcitol was the most dominant one (20 %), followed by the biotypes that ferment dulcitol, raffinose, and rhamnose (13.3 %).",

Literature was searched for similarity in sugars used and relation of biotypes and strains; then comparison was made with the biotypes of this study. Johan et al. (1988) also reported 11 different biotypes, using four carbohydrates, from healthy and diarrheic rabbits; biotype 3 (35.5 %) (dulcitol, rhamnose, and sucrose fermenters) and biotype 8 (7.1 %) (dulcitol and rhamnose fermenters) induced lesions characteristic of attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC). Serotyping showed a close relationship between biotype and serotype of the AEEC examined. Even though the proportions of biotype 3 of the above result was dissimilar to the present study of biotype IV (16.2 %) (fermented dulcitol, inositol (not used by the above author), rhamnose, and sucrose), their fermentation activity was identical. But the result and fermentation activity of the present study of biotype VII (1.4 %) (dulcitol and rhamnose fermenter) was consistent with the result of biotype 8 of Johan et al. (1988). In reference to their work, biotypes IV and VII of the present study could be AEEC. Variation in results of biotype IV of the present study and biotype 3 of Johan et al. (1988) might be the result of differences in sample size and animal species studied. These results were also in agreement with Levine et al. (1983) who stated that a given strain from diarrheic rabbit (that fermented dulcitol, rhamnose and xylose and assigned as biotype 6) isolated at the rate of 17.6 % was able to induce watery diarrhea and high mortality after experimental infection. This was in consistent with biotype VIII (20.3 %) of the present study. Similar observations have been made with other strains in England (Varga and Pesti 1982), Belgium and the Netherlands (Peeters et al. 1984), and France (Camguilhem et al. 1986). None of these strains produced heat-labile or heat-stable enterotoxins, nor were they enteroinvasive. Histology and electron microscopy has also showed their tight adherence to the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells. So they are considered to be enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). So, biotype VIII of the present study could be suggested to be EPEC.",
