The patient originally had signs and symptoms consistent with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Before transfer, SARS was excluded from the differential diagnosis because the patient had not traveled, had never left the emergency department of the referring hospital, and had only had a single recent outpatient visit to an area of the original hospital in which SARS had not been identified. Upon arrival in our ICU, the patient was placed in precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pending admission screening results (6). Therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs was initiated. Humidified high-flow oxygen was administered for the first 5 h, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation by oronasal mask for the next 18.25 h, and invasive mechanical ventilation for the subsequent time (7.5 h). Endotracheal intubation required fiber-optic placement. That the extent of the outbreak at the referring institution was larger than originally appreciated became apparent at this time; therefore, the patient was transferred to another facility for placement in negative pressure isolation for possible exposure to SARS. Subsequently, his family members became ill, and the SARS-associated coronavirus was identified in the patient\u2019s respiratory secretions (polymerase chain reaction testing of bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the diagnosis of SARS).",

Two-sided tests were used for all comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Classification and regression tree methods were used to identify predictors of developing SARS (8). The healthcare workers were divided into two groups by examining all possible cutpoints of all predictor variables to find the cutpoint of a predictor variable that resulted in the largest difference in the probabilities of developing SARS between the two resulting subgroups. This procedure was performed repeatedly for each resulting subgroup until all members of the subgroup had the same SARS status or the subgroup was too small to warrant further splitting.",

Second, SARS developed in another healthcare worker who had no identified contact with the index patient or with any other persons known to have SARS. In the case of the first healthcare worker, the absence of eye protection may have contributed to disease transmission. In addition, although this person wore an N-95 mask while in the patient\u2019s room, he had not been fit-tested for this mask; however, fit-testing should not be necessary if the SARS-associated coronavirus is spread by large droplets (6). As a result of this and similar episodes of SARS transmission in the Toronto area (10), the province of Ontario has now made specific recommendations for healthcare workers performing intubation that involve increased protection (available from: URL: www.sars.medtau.org) (11), and protective eye wear is currently mandated for patient encounters. In the second case, transmission could have occurred in a number of possible routes. The nurse may have come within sufficient range of the SARS patient to be exposed to large droplets. Recent reports indicate that the virus may survive for several hours on fomites or in body secretions (12) and raise the possibility of transmission by indirect contact with contaminated objects or of inadvertent carriage and spread by another healthcare worker. Fecal transmission is unlikely as the patient did not have a bowel movement during his stay. True airborne spread may also have occurred. Although evidence does not support this route of transmission for the SARS-associated coronavirus, existing literature suggests that other coronaviruses may be spread by an airborne route in certain circumstances (13).",

In addition, we closed the ICU to admissions and discharges for a 10-day period, markedly affecting our institution\u2019s ability to deliver health care. In fact, during the Toronto outbreak, several of the city\u2019s ICUs were closed as a result of quarantine and illness in staff with similar consequences (14); by infecting healthcare workers, SARS has an impact on the health of an entire community. A less aggressive quarantine approach may have been as effective in controlling transmission and allowed more staff to be available for work. For instance, only persons who have had direct contact with the patient (i.e., entered the patient\u2019s room) could have been quarantined. If we had taken this approach, the quarantine would have excluded six persons with SARS from the workplace but only removed 25 of the 62 persons who remained well. However, this approach would have missed one healthcare worker in whom SARS developed. Another approach might be to monitor staff closely for SARS-related symptoms while they continue their usual activities and quarantine only those in whom symptoms occur. This approach would require evidence that SARS cannot be transmitted before symptom onset, confidence in the facility\u2019s ability to identify symptomatic staff, and reliability of healthcare workers in reporting symptoms. We think that our quarantine approach prevented secondary spread of illness to other persons who may have come in contact with the workers in whom SARS developed.",

First, the possibility of unexpected exposure of healthcare workers to patients with SARS should be anticipated, and once such exposure is recognized, those deemed to be at risk for SARS transmission should be promptly quarantined. Second, vigilant surveillance for symptoms of SARS must be maintained by all healthcare workers who work in institutions with SARS patients; SARS may develop in healthcare workers even when they do not have direct exposure to patients with SARS. In addition, protocols for managing patients with SARS should include not only contact and respiratory precautions but also procedures that minimize patient contact since duration and proximity of contact increase the risk for transmission of SARS. Finally, additional precautions should be taken when performing high-risk procedures, such as endotracheal intubation (11).",

Use of gowns, gloves, and masks as barriers appears to reduce the risk for SARS transmission in most but not all situations. Additional information will be needed to determine if modes of transmission beyond droplet spread are important.
