            "text": "We have demonstrated previously that the introduction of two amino acids that match the human sequence at positions 288 and 330 in the mDPP4 receptor can support MERS-CoV docking, entry and replication in cell culture7. These determinants are located within exons 10 and 11 of mDPP4 on chromosome 2 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 genome editing to introduce these determinants (A288L and T330R) into the mDPP4 receptor (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Two lines of C57BL/6J-derived mice were generated that were either homozygous (288/330+/+) or heterozygous (288/330+/\u2212) for the chimaeric mDPP4 alleles (Fig. 1a). The 288/330+/+ homozygous mice encoded the 288L and 330R changes on both chromosomes, thereby expressing only mDPP4 with both changes (Fig. 1a). The 288/330+/\u2212 heterozygous mice encoded the 288L and 330R changes on one chromosome and the C57BL/6J wild-type amino acids, A288 and T330, on the other chromosome, thereby expressing both mutated and wild-type mDPP4 (Fig. 1a). The innate mDPP4 expression levels and patterns in the lungs, kidneys and brains of 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 mice reflected those observed in C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Fig. 1b,c; Supplementary Fig. 2). DPP4 is central to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in mammals16. Blood glucose levels were within the normal range observed in C57BL/6J wild-type mice, supporting the hypothesis that biological mDPP4 functions were not altered in the 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover, basal CD4+ T-cell expression of interleukin-2, tumour-necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, CD69, CD25 and mDPP4 (CD26) from the 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 lines was comparable to the levels observed in C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. 3). Notwithstanding functional T-cell assessment, these results suggested that minimal alteration of the 288 and 330 alleles does not alter basal T-cell activation status. Overall expression levels, expression patterns, biological function and the immunological profiles of mDPP4 were comparable to those of C57BL/6J wild-type mice following site-specific modification of the 288 and 330 alleles.",

In parallel, a MERS-CoV tissue-culture-adapted variant, derived by infection of NIH/3T3 cells ectopically expressing the chimaeric mDPP4 (A288L/T330R) receptor, was found to encode a three amino acid insertion (RMR) and a single amino acid change (S885L) in the S2 region of the spike gene. This recombinantly derived virus, MERS-0, encoding the RMR and S885L S2 mutations, demonstrated significantly enhanced replication both in cell culture (Supplementary Fig. 4) and in the lungs of 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1d; P<0.05). Despite replicating to significantly higher virus titres in vivo than the other isolates, MERS-0 exhibited no evidence of severe clinical disease symptoms (Supplementary Fig. 4). Lung histology demonstrated that nucleocapsid antigen from MERS-0 (Fig. 1e), and from the other strains (not shown), was readily detected in the lungs of infected mice by immunohistochemistry, but infected lungs exhibited only moderate signs of respiratory pathology and inflammation. These results demonstrated that we had developed a MERS-CoV model that could support high levels of virus replication up to day 3 post-infection (p.i.), but that further in vivo adaptation was required to achieve the respiratory symptoms characteristic of MERS-CoV infection in humans.",

Infection of 288/330+/+ mice via the intranasal route with MERS-15 resulted in \u223c70% mortality (genuine mortality, rather than mice meeting the typical 20% weight loss cut-off associated with humane euthanasia criteria), while 100% of infected 288/330+/\u2212 mice survived (Fig. 2a). However, both lines exhibited 20\u201325% weight loss by day 6 p.i., in contrast to MERS-0-infected 288/330+/+ mice or MERS-15-infected C57BL/6J wild-type mice, which exhibited no weight loss (Fig. 2b). Significantly higher levels of MERS-15 replication were detectable in the lungs of both 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 mice at days 3 and 6 p.i., while MERS-0 was mostly cleared from the lungs by day 6 p.i. (Fig. 2c,d). Similar to MER-0, MERS-15 did not replicate in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Importantly, the observed decreases in survival and weight loss induced by MERS-15 were not confounded by neurological complications from brain infection, as plaque assays for replication-competent virus and PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) at days 3 and 6 p.i. were negative (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR on the same samples demonstrated an increase of >106 detectable viral transcripts in infected lungs compared with similarly infected C57BL/6J mice, with no detectable viral transcripts in the brains of these mice (Supplementary Fig. 5c).",

            "text": "Although mortality and weight loss provide important measures of MERS-CoV-induced disease, these parameters do not directly assess the impact of virus replication on respiratory function. Therefore, to directly assess the impact of MERS-15 infection on respiratory function in 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 mice, we measured respiratory function using unrestrained plethysmography, as demonstrated previously for respiratory pathogenesis in mouse models of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza17. MERS-15 elicited severe lung disease as quantified by enhanced pause (Penh), a unitless measure that reflects airway obstruction/restriction due to debris in the airway, and by midtidal expiratory flow (EF50), which represents the flow rate at which 50% of the tidal volume has been expelled in a single breath17. MERS-15 infection led to significant increases in both Penh and EF50 in 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 mice up to day 6 p.i. compared with 288/330+/+ mice infected with MERS-0 and C57BL/6J wild-type mice infected with MERS-15 (Fig. 3a,b), demonstrating that MERS-15 elicited severe respiratory distress in mice carrying the chimaeric DPP4 receptor. This was further supported by our observation of severe haemorrhage in the lungs of both 288/330+/+ and 288/330+/\u2212 mice infected with MERS-15 at days 3 and 6 (Supplementary Fig. 6), inflammatory infiltrates by day 3 (Fig. 3c) and respiratory pathology associated with severe acute respiratory distress, including hyaline membrane formation, intra-alveolar oedema, perivascular cuffing and severe inflammation, at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 3d). Quantitative comparison of the lung pathology in 288/330+/+ mice infected with MERS-15 and MERS-0 demonstrated that MERS-15 induced significant levels of pathology commensurate with ARDS by day 6 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 7). Although we did not conduct an exhaustive assessment of all extrapulmonary tissues in the 288/330+/+ mice, we could not detect virus replication in the brain, even at doses of 5 \u00d7 106 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) up to day 6 when the humane euthanasia end points were reached, and the pathology observed in our model was consistent with the severe respiratory pathology associated with fatal ARDS in the only published case study of a human MERS-CoV infection18.",

Sequencing of the entire MERS-15 C2 genome revealed a set of unique missense mutations, acquired during in vivo passaging, in the genes encoding the non-structural proteins, nsP2, nsP6 and nsP8, and a large deletion in orf4b that may be responsible for the enhanced disease observed with MERS-15 (Supplementary Fig. 9). Sequencing of MERS-15 C1 revealed some differences that may influence the capacity of the virus to elicit the increased mortality observed with MERS-15 C2, namely mutations in nsP2 and an expanded deletion that extended from orf4b into orf5 (Supplementary Fig. 9). Moreover, 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed that the nucleotide at position 2 of the 5\u2032 untranslated region was deleted in both clones (Supplementary Fig. 9). Generation of an infectious clone harbouring all of the MERS-15 C2 mutations (icMERSma1) demonstrated that the disease could be reproduced with an infectious dose of 5 \u00d7 106 p.f.u. (Supplementary Fig. 10). Decreasing the dose by 10-fold to 5 \u00d7 105 p.f.u. resulted in weight loss that paralleled that observed with 5 \u00d7 106 p.f.u.; however, the 5 \u00d7 105 p.f.u. dose exhibited a slight decrease in mortality up to day 7 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 10). Although additional studies will be needed, comparative genomic analysis of the two clones, C1 and C2, indicated that nsP2 and Orf5 may have significant roles in determining disease outcome. Therefore, the MERS-15 C2 derived virus, combined with the 288/330+/+ mouse line, represent useful tools for studying MERS-CoV pathogenesis or assessing therapeutic countermeasures against MERS-CoV-induced ARDS.",

Pretreating mice for 12 h with 3B11 provided 100% protection against MERS-15 C2 challenge (Fig. 5a,b). Moreover, 3B11 treatment reduced viral loads in the lungs of infected mice to undetectable levels (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 11) and protected from loss of respiratory function (Fig. 5d) (Supplementary Fig. 11), pulmonary haemorrhage (Supplementary Fig. 11) and severe pathological changes (Supplementary Fig. 12). In contrast, pretreatment with isotype control antibody provided no protective effect. Therefore, these data convincingly demonstrated that our preclinical mouse model of severe respiratory disease and mortality can serve as a platform for assessing MERS-CoV therapeutics.",

All mice receiving spike\u2013VRP survived and exhibited no weight loss following challenge compared with GFP\u2013VRP mock-vaccinated animals (Fig. 6a,b). Spike\u2013VRP vaccination significantly reduced MERS-15 C2 replication in the lungs of infected mice as shown by both plaque titre (Fig. 6c) and viral antigen staining (Supplementary Fig. 14), while also protecting against severe respiratory disease, as assessed by measurement of Penh (Fig. 6d) and EF50 (Supplementary Fig. 13), lung haemorrhage (Supplementary Fig. 13) and pathological indications of severe acute respiratory disease (Supplementary Fig. 14). Neutralization of MERS-15 C2 with prechallenge serum from spike\u2013VRP-vaccinated mice validated the presence of high-titre neutralizing antibodies in the serum of vaccinated 288/330+/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 13).

Coupled with an inability to elicit escape mutants, 3B11 has also been tested in NHPs5, making it an excellent candidate for downstream human studies. However, existing NHP models rely on quantitative RT-PCR, rather than measures of infectious virus, to quantify viral loads, and these models do not reproducibly result in the severe respiratory disease or mortality observed in human MERS patients1\u20134.

Furthermore, MERS-CoV antigen staining localized the virus to pneumocytes and syncytial cells18. Infection of type I and II pneumocytes can lead to cell death, as observed in autopsies of patients who have died from severe respiratory infections with influenza virus and SARS-CoV21,22. Moreover, pneumocyte cell death has been proposed to cause decreased respiratory function, as measured by whole-body plethysmography in a mouse model of influenza23. Commensurate with these previous studies, our MERS-CoV mouse model demonstrated widespread infection of pneumocytes and pathology consistent with diffuse alveolar damage and severe respiratory disease. This was corroborated by decreased pulmonary function in the MERS-CoV model, as measured by plethysmography, which may be associated with widespread infection and possibly the death of pneumocytes and airway epithelial cells. Therefore, this model system provides the field with the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms that lead to MERS-CoV-induced pathology and severe respiratory disease, in the absence of any CNS complications.",

These models exhibited infection/replication in the lungs following intranasal administration at low viral doses (102\u2013105 p.f.u.), which in some cases resulted in pathology indicative of pneumonia-like disease12\u201314. One limitation of the 288/330+/+ MERS-CoV model described here was the use of high viral loads to achieve severe, and often fatal, respiratory disease. Further adaptation may allow the use of lower infectious doses that would produce a model of mild disease with subsequent recovery at later time points, as has been described with SARS-CoV25. In this context, it is interesting that the deletion of MERS-CoV ORF4b, a phosphodiesterase and antagonist of RNase L activity in human cells, appeared less critical for eliciting severe disease in rodents26, suggesting possible species-specific modes of action in vivo. Deletions in some SARS-CoV interferon antagonist genes and accessory open reading frames have also yielded subtle changes in overall virulence in vivo27,28. However, it is important to point out that a balance must be achieved between the virulence of mouse-adapted virus, which enhances the model's capacity to replicate human disease phenotypes, and the number of mutations required to significantly reduce the dose lethal to 50% of animals tested.",

Furthermore, high viral loads were detected in the brains of mice in the transgenic hDPP4 overexpression models12\u201314. Importantly, Li et al.13 concluded that \u201cmortality correlated with brain infection, suggesting that infection of this organ was most important for the high mortality observed in K18-hDPP4 mice\u201d. While these lethal models have value for vaccine and immunotherapeutic testing29, small-molecule inhibitors that are effective in the lung may be limited in their efficacy due to an inability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier30. Similar neurological complications have been observed in model systems for SARS that used overexpression, or tissue-specific constitutive promoters, to express human angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in mice31. While additional human pathology studies are needed to determine the extent of extrapulmonary sites of MERS-CoV replication and their impact on MERS-CoV disease, it is clear that respiratory replication and pathology is an important aspect of human MERS-CoV disease. Therefore, an important attribute of the 288/330+/+ model is that the lack of detectable virus replication in the CNS means this model can be used to study MERS-CoV-induced pulmonary disease without the confounding effects of death due to CNS infection.",

As demonstrated here, GOF studies were absolutely necessary to develop a mouse model that reflects the ARDS pathology observed previously in humans infected with respiratory pathogens. Importantly, the GOF studies performed here yielded MERS-CoV strains that reflect the complexity of clinical isolates identified recently in humans, where deletions were identified in ORF3 and ORF4A32. Moreover, these GOF studies have allowed us to identify mutations in MERS-CoV proteins that may influence how MERS-CoV interacts with, and possibly circumvents, host immune responses. Nevertheless, future studies to evaluate host factors that contribute to MERS-CoV disease will be constrained in this model, as well as in hDPP4 expression models, by the fact that the mice must be backcrossed to mouse lines harbouring modified endogenous genes, such as knock-out mice. This limitation may be overcome through additional GOF studies that facilitate MERS-CoV adaptation to the innate mDPP4 receptor molecule. The continued threats from novel emerging pathogens, such as Zika virus, will demand the rapid development of physiologically relevant animal models to evaluate therapeutic countermeasures, thereby necessitating virus adaptation to host immunity to achieve effective models. It is critical that the GOF regulatory structure does not impede the development of robust animal models of human disease, which are essential for protecting the public health.",

The messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding Cas9 endonuclease and guide RNAs (gRNAs) were based on the system established by Mali et al.34 and prepared as described below. The gRNAs (Supplementary Table 1) were generated by an in vitro transcription reaction using a T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis kit (NEB), where 1 \u00b5g DraI-linearized template DNA was used in a 20 \u00b5l reaction following the kit guidelines for short RNA transcripts.

Mice that reached 20% weight loss were placed under exception and monitored at least twice daily. Mice that approached 30% weight loss were euthanized immediately. Mice deemed moribund were euthanized at the discretion of the researcher. Mice were euthanized with an isoflurane overdose followed by a secondary thoracotomy, at various time points, to collect lung tissues.
