The designation N1 refers to the fact that the first amino acid (residue 318) was deleted to avoid glycosylation at the N-terminus.14 However, the default production process used for RBD219-N1 still had several areas that could be improved or optimized before translating to a suitable pilot manufacturing scale. These included improving the fermentation yield and purification recovery, as the fermentation yield using the default process was only 60 mg RBD219-N1/L of fermentation supernatant (FS) and the purification process had not been optimized. In this study, we optimized the upstream process to generate a fermentation yield of approximately 400 mg RBD219-N1/L FS. The purification process was also optimized to a final recovery exceeding 50 percent. This final optimized production process was validated in 3 identical production runs, and an array of characterization procedures for the process indicated high reproducibility and robustness. Further characterization of the purified RBD219-N1 demonstrated that the protein was highly pure with well-defined secondary and tertiary structures. The process has since been transferred to a pilot manufacturing plant and a 60 L scale manufacture has been performed under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). The cGMP grade\u2013purified RBD219-N1 (drug substance) is to be used in support of future phase-1 trials.",

Following the small-scale screening, 5-10 L fermentation runs were performed under different induction conditions, such as pH (6.0 and 6.5), temperature (24-30\u00b0C), carbon feeds (sorbitol co-feed), methanol flow rate, and fermentation media (basal salt media or low salt media15 [LS; 4.55 g/L potassium sulfate, 3.73 g/L magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 1.03 g/L potassium hydroxide, 0.23 g/L calcium sulfate dehydrate, 10.9 mL/L phosphoric acid {85%}, and 40 g/L glycerol]). The default fermentation procedure was described in the previous study13 and used to generate a baseline to compare with the optimized fermentation procedure developed here. One milliliter of seed stock was inoculated into 500 mL buffered minimal glycerol medium, and the culture was incubated overnight at 30\u00b0 C with constant shaking at 250 rpm until an OD600 of \u223c10. Approximately 250 mL overnight culture was inoculated into 5 L sterile LS medium containing 3.5 mL/L PTM1 Trace Elements and 3.5 mL/L 0.02% D-Biotin. Fermentation was initiated and maintained at 30\u00b0 C and pH 5.0. Gas and agitation were adjusted to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at 30%. On exhaustion of glycerol during the batch phase (dissolved oxygen spike), the pH was ramped up to 6.5 using 14% ammonium hydroxide, and the temperature was lowered to 25\u00b0 C over 1 h. After the pH and temperature ramping, the methanol induction phase was initiated. Methanol was added from 1 mL/L/h to 11 mL/L/h over 6 h. After this methanol adaptation phase, the methanol feed was maintained at 11 mL/L/h for 18 h, elevated from 11 to 13 mL/L/h over 6 h and then maintained at 13 mL/L/h for 18 h. Finally, the methanol feed rate was further increased from 13 to 15 mL/L/h over 6 h and maintained at 15 mL/L/h until the end of fermentation (\u223c70 h of methanol induction). After fermentation, cells were removed from the culture by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C using a Beckman Avanti J-26 XPI High-Speed Centrifuge equipped with a JLA 8.1000 rotor. After centrifugation, the wet cell weight was measured and the supernatant was used for further purification.",

The emission peak \u03bbmax of RBD219-N1 at pH 7.5 was measured at 626 nm suggested RBD219-N1 was less hydrophobic than BSA (\u03bbmax = 620 nm) and more hydrophobic than lysozyme (\u03bbmax = 650 nm), which was consistent with the results on the calculated surface hydrophobicity (S0;BSA > S0;RBD219-N1> S0;Lysozyme). The effect of pH on the surface hydrophobicity of RBD219-N1 was also studied. The results showed that the hydrophobicity remained constant at pH 5.0-9.5 (\u03bbmax = 627 \u00b1 3 and S0 = 52 \u00b1 7 RFU mL/mg) and increased at pH 4.0 (\u03bbmax = 618 nm and S0 = 76.8 RFUmL/mg) suggesting possible denaturation at pH 4.0.",

The thermal stability of the secondary structure was assessed by heating the sample from 25\u00b0 C to 85\u00b0C (Figs. 4b-4d). The best signal-to-noise data were obtained at 220 nm (Fig. 4c) and 230 nm (Fig. 4d). The onset of structural changes was observed at approximately 43\u00b0C (Ton1) and based on the first derivative (blue curves; Figs. 4c and 4d), and the average melting temperature (Tm1) was estimated to be 61\u00b0C. Interestingly, a second CD change was observed (Ton2) at approximately 78\u00b0C at all wavelengths, indicating another structure-change event. Overall, the CD signal decreased further at all wavelengths as thermal stress increased (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. S2), which may indicate transformation occurred within the secondary structure of RBD219-N1 rather than a complete denaturation at higher temperature.",

            "text": "With respect to the purification process, as the binding of the HIC column was low (<0.49 mg RBD219-N1/mL Butyl HP) in the default process,13 we aimed to optimize binding of the target protein to the HIC column. To this extent, several parameters were investigated including resin type, salt choice for the binding buffer, and concentration of the fermentation supernatant loaded onto the column. During the optimization, Capto Butyl resin (particle size 75 \u03bcm) and Butyl HP resin (particle size 34 \u03bcm) were compared, and Butyl HP was chosen on account of its better resolution and better ability to remove impurities. Because the RBD219-N1 in the default process was the last protein eluted from the HIC column using an ammonium sulfate gradient, 2 environmentally more friendly salts with lower ionic strength, sodium sulfate and sodium chloride, were investigated. However, neither salt provided the same high binding affinity and resolution achieved with ammonium sulfate. Finally, the concentration of the sample before application to the column was optimized. Rather than diluting the fermentation supernatant with buffer containing a high concentration of ammonium sulfate as described previously,13 we first concentrated the fermentation supernatant and then dissolved solid ammonium sulfate directly into the sample. This process increased the binding more than 9-fold, which reduced the required resin volume. However, to accommodate the high back pressure due to the smaller resin particle size and the higher viscosity of the more concentrated loading material, the flow rate had to be decreased from 100 to 50 cm/h with the bed height maintained at 11 \u00b1 2 cm. Finally, to meet the industry standard for technology transfer, gradient elution for the HIC process was converted to stepwise elution. Although SEC columns are not ideal for large-scale processes, we decided to retain this step because it efficiently removed the remaining impurities. Intensive efforts were spent on the investigation of alternative purification schemes, including different capture, intermediate, or polishing steps (ion exchange, multimodel, etc.), but the recovery was low and the final product lacked sufficient purity.",

            "text": "During quantification of the protein by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue, BSA standards were replaced with purified RBD219-N1 standards. Although BSA has served as a common standard for several commercially available quantitative assays (e.g., the BCA assay) due to its high purity and easy availability, using a homologous standard is often preferred on account of protein-specific differential uptake of Coomassie Blue dye.23 Depending on the protein, Coomassie Blue reacts differently with each protein, which may cause intensity difference, even for the same protein concentration. In our case, RBD219-N1 only stained 75 \u00b1 5% as efficient as BSA, leading to an underestimation of the protein concentration. The optimized quantitative densitometry assay was used to calculate the process recovery and the process yield. Typically, overall production yield of a recombinant protein relies on fermentation yield and purification recovery. Depending on the gene sequence and the size of the expressed protein, fermentation yield of a recombinant protein successfully expressed in yeast can vary dramatically ranging from 20 mg/L to 14.8 g/L,26,28,29 and biophysical properties of the expressed protein determine the purification process and the recovery. For a 10-20 L scale production of subunit vaccine candidates expressed in yeast, the fermentation yield can range from 150 mg/L to 1 g/L with recovery of 31% to 55% and target protein purity of 97% to 99%.18,30,31 The optimized production process for RBD219-N1 has consistently and reproducibly provided high yields during fermentation (\u223c400 mg RBD219-N1/L FS), with an overall process recovery more than 50% (final purification yield of 226 mg RBD/L FS) and protein purity of \u223c 99%, which suggests the production process is comparable to other subunit vaccine production processes at similar scale.",

Using silver-stained SDS-PAGE, trace amounts of low molecular weight degradation products or host cell proteins were observed, whereas dimers were observed on Western blot, likely stemming from intermolecular disulfide bonds between the remaining free cysteine of RBD219-N1. Although only trace amounts of nontarget proteins were observed, highly sensitive assays allow increased ability to monitor the integrity and purity of the product that will ensure the level of degradation and aggregation does not increase and cause stability issues. Surface hydrophobicity of RBD219-N1 was also studied using extrinsic fluorescence of Nile Red. It is noted that surface hydrophobicity of RBD219-N1 remained unchanged at pH 5.0-9.5; however, an increase of surface hydrophobicity was observed at pH 4.0, which suggested possible denaturation, thus exposure of hydrophobic sites. Furthermore, DLS experiments on samples at pH 4.0 and 5.0 also indicated protein aggregation. Negative diffusion interaction parameter measured by DLS showed the propensity of oligomer formation or aggregation for all the pH tested, indicating extra attention should be taken for its long-term stability. Collectively, the results obtained from extrinsic fluorescence and DLS experiments suggested RBD219-N1 was most likely stable at pH 6.5-9.5 but instable at pH 4.0 and 5.0, which indicates any formulation at lower pH (>pH 5.0) should be avoided.",

Currently, a series of stability studies including real-time long-term stability, accelerated stability, and freeze-thaw stability testing are underway to further characterize the protein. In the meantime, the technology of this production process has been transferred to a pilot manufacturer, and a batch of purified RBD219-N1 has been manufactured under cGMP to support downstream clinical trials.",
