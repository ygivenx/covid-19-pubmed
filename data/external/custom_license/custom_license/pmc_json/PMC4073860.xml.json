Of the 10 dromedaries that tested positive for MERS-CoV, 9 had parallel nasal and fecal specimens tested, with virus detected in the nasal swab specimens from 8 and the fecal specimen from 1. At the December 30 sampling, 7 of 8 calves and 2 of 3 adults tested positive for MERS-CoV, indicating that when MERS-CoV circulates on a farm, both calves and adults can be infected (Technical Appendix Table). Because all 12 adults with serum collected before December 30 were seropositive (titers >320), it is likely, though not certain, that the MERS-CoV infections in the 2 adults (nos. 21, 19Dam) sampled on December 30 were reinfections, as has been reported for other CoVs (8). The seronegative 1-year-old calves, nos. 13 and 14, had the highest nasal viral loads (UpE assay 1.3 \u00d7 108 to 1.78 \u00d7 108/mL specimen), and a 2-week-old calf, no. 22, with (presumably passively acquired) titers of 1,280 became infected but had a much lower viral load. Overall, these data suggest that prior infection or passively acquired maternal antibody might not provide complete protection from infection (Technical Appendix Table).",

Calf no. 13 (1 year of age) had a high viral load and was seronegative at the first MERS-CoV\u2013positive result (indicating that it had been recently infected) but was MERS-CoV RNA negative 6 weeks later, suggesting that virus shedding is not prolonged. We did not detect virus RNA by RT-PCR in the 3 acute-phase serum samples from infected dromedaries (nos. 1, 16, 17), suggesting that acute infection is not associated with prolonged viremia.
