The family Arenaviridae consists of a single genus (Arenavirus), which includes at least 23 recognized viruses4. Arenaviruses have been classified into two antigenically and geographically distinct groups, the Lassa\u2013lymphocytic choriomeningitis serocomplex (\u2018Old World arenaviruses\u2019) and the Tacaribe serocomplex (\u2018New World arenaviruses\u2019). Five arenaviruses are known to cause acute viral haemorrhagic fever in humans, with case-fatality rates as high as 30%. Lassa virus (LASV) is an Old World arenavirus that causes Lassa fever. Machupo (MACV), Guanarito (GTOV), Junin (JUNV) and Sabia (SABV) viruses are New World arenaviruses that cause Bolivian, Venezuelan, Argentinian and Brazilian haemorrhagic fever, respectively. LASV, MACV, GTOV and JUNV have been classified as National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogens, in part because of their lethality and significant potential for misuse4,5.",

Like other class 1 fusion proteins, GP1 is thought to mediate association with a cellular receptor7. After internalization of the virus to an acidified endosomal compartment, GP2 undergoes a conformational change that promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes7,8,9. We characterized a series of MACV GP1 truncation variants, fused at their carboxy termini to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (Fig. 1a). Only full-length MACV GP1 (residues 59\u2013258) and a single truncation variant, GP1\u0394 (residues 79\u2013258), efficiently bound MACV-permissive Vero African green monkey kidney cells, whereas GP1 variants expressing residues 102\u2013258, 121\u2013258, 59\u2013170 or 59\u2013205 did not (Supplementary Fig. 1a). GP1\u0394 bound Vero cells saturably and more efficiently than GP1 (Fig. 1b). GP1\u0394, but not the receptor-binding domains of Lake Victoria marburgvirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus entry proteins, precipitated from Vero cells a protein of 95 kDa under reducing conditions, and approximately 200 kDa under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1c). Mass-spectrometric analysis identified this protein as TfR1 (CD71). MACV GP1 efficiently bound a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing human TfR1 (CHO-hTfR1)10 but did not bind parental CHO cells, confirming a high-affinity association between MACV GP1 and human TfR1 (Fig. 1d).",

Consistent with previous studies11,12 was our observation that murine NIH 3T3 cells and baby hamster kidney (BHK-S) and CHO cell lines were relatively non-permissive to MACV pseudovirus and did not bind MACV GP1. Vero, rhesus macaque LLC-MK2, and human HeLa and 293T cell lines efficiently bound GP1 and were permissive to MACV-GP-mediated infection (not shown). Consistent with the binding study in Fig. 1d was our observation that CHO-hTfR1 cells, but not parental CHO cells, were efficiently infected by MACV pseudoviruses, whereas LASV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) pseudoviruses infected CHO-hTfR1 and parental cells comparably (Fig. 2a). We investigated the ability of an anti-human TfR1 antibody and a control anti-HLA (anti-human leukocyte antigen) antibody to inhibit infection mediated by MACV and LASV GP proteins. Both antibodies efficiently bound HeLa and 293T cells (Fig. 2b, upper panels) but only the anti-human TfR1 antibody inhibited infection by MACV pseudovirus (Fig. 2b, lower panels). The anti-human TfR1 antibody had no effect on LASV pseudovirus infection. Together, these data indicate that TfR1 is a necessary receptor for MACV.",

Infection of CHO-hTfR1 cells by JUNV, but not LASV, pseudovirus was substantially more efficient than infection of parental CHO cells (Fig. 3a). Like MACV pseudovirus, JUNV pseudovirus infection of 293T cells was inhibited by anti-human TfR1 antibody (Fig. 3b). Replication of infectious MACV, GTOV, JUNV and SABV in 293T cells was markedly inhibited by anti-human TfR1 antibody, but not by anti-HLA antibody (Fig. 3c). Nearly identical results were obtained with HeLa cells (not shown). These data indicate that TfR1 is an obligate receptor for each of these New World haemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, despite the diversity of their GP1 proteins, but are consistent with previous studies indicating that these viruses use a common cellular receptor11,12.",

Infection by MACV, JUNV, LASV, GTOV or LCMV pseudoviruses was not enhanced by the introduction of human TfR2 in CHO or BHK cells (Fig. 4a) despite its efficient expression (Supplementary Fig. 1b). LCMV has been proposed to use a receptor in addition to \u03b1-dystroglycan11, but no enhancement of LCMV pseudovirus entry was observed in the presence of human TfR1, indicating that this alternative receptor is not human TfR1. Transferrin is present at micromolar concentrations in human plasma13. We investigated whether iron-bound (holo) transferrin, which binds TfR1 with high affinity, or apo-transferrin, which does not, could modulate the infection of MACV pseudoviruses. Holo-transferrin did not interfere with the binding of MACV-GP1 or LASV-GP1 to 293T cells (not shown). Neither holo-transferrin nor apo-transferrin interfered with or enhanced infection with MACV pseudoviruses (Fig. 4b). Soluble TfR1 is also found in plasma at concentrations of about 20 nM, and up to 150 nM in anaemic individuals14. Soluble TfR1 inhibited the infection of 293T cells by JUNV and, to a smaller extent, MACV pseudoviruses (Fig. 4c). No inhibition of LASV pseudovirus infection was observed.",

We investigated the effect of iron depletion on MACV, JUNV and LASV GP-mediated infection. JUNV pseudovirus more efficiently infected 293T cells and SLK human endothelial cells preincubated with the iron chelator deferoxamine (Fig. 5a), used clinically to treat iron toxicity18. However, treatment with deferoxamine consistently had a more modest effect on MACV pseudovirus infection. The basis of the lower sensitivity of MACV pseudovirus infection to deferoxamine is not clear, but it may indicate a role for an additional factor, limiting in these assays, in the entry of MACV. LASV infection was unaffected by deferoxamine at all concentrations. We also investigated the ability of excess iron to modulate GP-mediated infection. Ferric ammonium citrate, which downregulates TfR1 (ref. 19), efficiently inhibited MACV and JUNV pseudovirus infection but not that of LASV or LCMV. These data show that iron concentrations can modulate the efficiencies of MACV and JUNV infection.",

Several properties of TfR1 indicate its possible role in arenaviral replication and disease. It is rapidly and constitutively endocytosed to an acidic compartment, which is consistent with the pH dependence of arenavirus entry8. It is expressed ubiquitously, and at high levels on activated or rapidly dividing cells, including macrophages and activated lymphocytes, major targets of arenaviral infection20,21. TfR1 is also highly expressed on endothelial cells22,23, which are thought to be central to the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic fever24. TfR1 upregulation on immune cells activated in response to infection may accelerate viral replication in these cells and may in part explain the higher lethality of New World haemorrhagic fevers compared with Lassa fever. Some of these properties may also be useful to canine and feline parvoviruses and to mouse mammary tumour virus, animal viruses that also use TfR1 (refs 25, 26).",

However, soluble TfR1, which we have shown to inhibit MACV and JUNV GP-mediated infection, is also elevated in iron-deficient animals and can be found in anaemic individuals at concentrations that may inhibit JUNV replication14. Further studies will be necessary to clarify the role of iron deficiency as a risk factor in haemorrhagic fevers caused by New World arenaviruses.
