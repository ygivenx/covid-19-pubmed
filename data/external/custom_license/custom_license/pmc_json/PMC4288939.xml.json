            "text": "It has been shown that the Ebola virus primarily targets macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs); later, the membrane-associated glycoprotein (GP) in the virus can bind to endothelial cells, causing cell death and vascular permeability. The latter allows the virus to spread to vital organs and execute severe and extensive damage to the body. The symptom of bleeding appears when the virus gains entry into hepatocytes and causes liver failure. Although neutrophils, lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells appear to remain uninfected, those cells undergo \u2018bystander apoptosis\u2019, presumably induced by inflammatory mediators and/or the loss of support signals from DCs. Dissemination to regional lymph nodes results in further rounds of virus replication, followed by a spread through the bloodstream to DCs, fixed and mobile macrophages in the liver, spleen, thymus, and other lymphoid tissues, resulting in an extensive tissue necrosis (Mohamadzadeh et al., 2007; Ansari, 2014) (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "The Ebola virus applies multiple physical and biological mechanisms to evade host innate and acquired humoral and cellular immune responses. Interferon (IFN) belongs to the cytokines that are used for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system that help eradicate pathogens. Inhibition of the IFN alarm seems to be one of the most important aspects in the pathogenesis of Ebola. The virus primarily antagonizes both the IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 responses in target cells, especially macrophages, monocytes, and DCs, by utilizing the viral protein VP35 to block the phosphorylation of the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which acts as a transcription factor for the IFN production (C\u00e1rdenas et al., 2006), whereas VP24 to block the IFN-mediated antiviral response (Xu et al., 2014). Macrophages play a critical role in non-specific defense, and they also help to initiate specific defense mechanisms by recruiting other immune cells such as lymphocytes. Massive infection of macrophages and related cells by the Ebola virus indicates that it is able to block or evade the cells\u2019 innate antiviral mechanisms. The NK cells respond in an antigen-independent manner to viral infections and kill infected cells. NK cell numbers dramatically drop during the course of infection and almost all undergo apoptosis. DCs have a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immunity; however, infected DCs do not produce proinflammatory cytokines or costimulatory molecules, their ability to support T-cell proliferation is thus impaired and the infected DCs undergo anomalous maturation (Hoenen et al., 2006). Impaired APCs function and lymphocyte apoptosis contribute to the failure of specific immune responsiveness. Ebola triggers the systemic dysregulation of immunity that likely results in an uncontrolled virus replication.",

In most patients, Ebola viral burden elevates by time and triggers an extremely strong immune attack\u2014a phenomenon called \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 (Sullivan et al., 2003), during which monocytes and/or macrophages produce a massive amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukins (ILs), and chemokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1/\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b1/\u03b2), macrophage/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), nitric oxide (NO), and eotaxin (Baize et al., 2002). By now, the body response to Ebola infection would be too severe and too late, and the cytokine storm leads to exaggerated inflammatory responses that contribute to lymphoid cell apoptosis and sepsis (Ansari, 2014). The virus eventually disables the vascular system and causes blood leakage combined with massive viremia and intravascular coagulopathy. The terminal stage of the virus infection usually includes diffusive bleeding and hypotensive shock, which would eventually kill the patients.",

Interestingly, the patients under the age of 21 years had a lower fatality rate of 57%, whereas the fatality rate was up to 94% in those over the age of 45 years, between these two age groups, the fatality rate was 74% (Schieffelin et al., 2014). Stem cells are the essential for the regenerative processes of almost all tissues and organs. The significant differences indicate that patients\u2019 cellular-level healing capacity in different age groups may be relevant to the consumption of age-related changes in the stem cell reservoir.

After exogenous administration, MSCs migrate to injured tissue sites where they can inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promote the survival of damaged cells. MSCs operate through a variety of effector mechanisms on key cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems, mostly through manipulating the cell cycle or inducing maturation arrest without apoptosis (Tyndall and Pistoia, 2009). The therapeutic effects of MSCs may depend largely on the capacity of MSCs to regulate inflammation and tissue homeostasis via an array of immunosuppressive factors, cytokines, growth factors, and differentiation factors. MSCs reduce inflammation by shutting down the TNF-\u03b1 pathway for immune cell activation and prevent a cytokine storm by inhibiting or disabling T-cell response. MSCs reprogram macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, DCs, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes, all of which counteract sepsis (Plock et al., 2013) (Fig. 4).",
