            "text": "When Joseph Stella journeyed to New York City from his native Italy in 1896, he intended to study medicine. Stella instead pursued art, which he studied at the Art Students League of New York under William Merritt Chase. During 1905\u20131909, Stella illustrated magazines, and he continued to draw throughout a career marked by numerous shifts in his style and approach to art. According to a brief bio from the Phillips Collection website, Stella \u201cbegan as an academic realist, but his mature work is in a modernist style, notable for its sweeping and dynamic lines.\u201d",

According to art critic Holland Carter, \u201cColor entered his art with a bang when he was introduced to Italian Futurism.\u201d Not long after returning to New York from Europe, Stella became immersed in modernism, and he is now viewed as a principal figure in American Modernism.",

The artist concentrates dark blue, gold, green, and red shards in the lower quarter, suggesting the interactions of biological and chemical processes following the spring thaw. Swirls of pale yellow accented with bursts of green, blue, and gold near the painting\u2019s center reflect the showiness of an early spring garden as the first flowers, shoots, and leaves appear, hungry insects and birds take wing, and lizards and amphibians awaken from their winter torpor. Green, the most common color in nature, dominants Stella\u2019s celebration of renewal. According to art critic Richard Nilsen, \u201cHe was one of those painters, like Van Gogh, who yearned to express the exploding aliveness of the world, a man with a visionary sense of cosmic energy.\u201d",

An editorial in Nature Reviews Microbiology, which attempts to quantify some of those numbers used to give perspective to this microscopic world, provides this frame of reference for viruses: \u201cAstronomy is a field that is used to dealing with large numbers, but these can be dwarfed when compared with life on the microbial scale. For instance, if all the 1 \u00d7 1031 viruses on earth were laid end to end, they would stretch for 100 million light years.\u201d And that is just the viruses!",

Since the 1980s, nearly 40 new pathogens have been identified as causes of disease in humans. HIV, Ebola virus, MERS coronavirus, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus are among the high-profile viruses that have emerged from the confluence of ecologic forces. Potential new exposure to these previously quiescent microbes can result from human incursion and settlement in remote and rural areas, food production and importation practices, and prevailing planetary weather and temperature.",

Similar to the explosion of springtime pollen, some emerging infections declare their presence with large outbreaks that are impossible to miss. Others are insidiously tenacious, going unnoticed until entrenched like flowing waves of kudzu. Even familiar foes such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and mycobacteria emerge in their own surprising new slivers of color with the development of multiple and extensively drug-resistant varieties.",

Those influential reports\u2014which represent the insights of Joshua Lederberg, Robert Shope, and their colleagues\u2014from the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) Committee on Emerging Microbial Threats offered far-reaching recommendations and galvanized support for research and public health action to address the challenges posed by new, emerging, and reemerging infectious diseases.
