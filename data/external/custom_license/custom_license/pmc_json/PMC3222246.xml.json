The distribution of bacteria found in cases of transfusion related sepsis showed Staphylococcus spp. in 42% of cases, Escherichia coli in 9%, Bacillus spp. in 9%, Salmonella spp. in 9%, Streptococcus spp. in 12%, Serratia spp. in 8%, Enterobacter spp. in 7%, and other organisms in 4%.

During the surveillance period, 216,283 platelet units were transfused. Only one type of bacterial contamination was detected by the passive surveillance method (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3-day old random-donor platelets). Thirty-eight contaminated platelet units or pools were detected by active surveillance. Six of them were not transfused. When transfused, the same contaminant was isolated from blood cultures obtained from the recipient in 7 cases. Coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most frequently isolated bacteria species followed by Staphyloccocus aureus. Thirteen of the patients who received the 32 contaminated platelets (31 detected by active surveillance and one detected by passive surveillance) developed transfusion reactions. Transfusion reaction rate was significantly higher for pooled random-donor platelets. Severe transfusion reactions occurred in 9 cases, and 3 patients died of complications, likely to be associated with the transfusion of contaminated platelet units (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens). Nine of the 13 transfusion-reactions were associated with bacterial counts >106 CFU/mL. The virulence of the bacteria appeared to be more important then the bacterial load. However, transfusion reactions with fever, rigors and hypotension were observed with coagulase-negative staphylococci at bacterial counts as low as 102 CFU/mL.5",

Whereas bacteria produce CO2, yeasts and fungi are high acid-producing organisms. Inoculation of approximately 7.5 mL of the platelet sample is necessary for each bottle, and is performed 24 hours after collection. The bottles are then incubated at 37\u00b0C. The CO2 production is correlated with the alteration of the reflection of the light on the sensor. When the color changes, an alarm is set off.

The results of this study have been reported by Schrezenmeier et al. in 2007. The BacT/ALERT\u00ae method was used to analyze 52,243 platelet concentrates (15,198 collected by apheresis and 37,045 pooled platelets). Of the 282 platelet concentrates with a first positive culture, a bacteria was identified in 135. Among these 135 concentrates, 37 were confirmed positive by second cultures. There was no significant difference in the rate of confirmed positive platelet concentrates between apheresis and pooled platelets. Among these 37 confirmed positive platelet concentrates, most bacteria isolated were skin flora bacteria. Propionibacterium acnes was found in 54% of them, and staphylococci species in 43% of them, with Staphylococcus epidermidis in most of the cases. Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus, which are potentially pathogenic bacteria, were isolated respectively in one plasma pooled platelet concentrate and in one apheresis platelet concentrate. This study demonstrated that a large scale routine screening of platelets prepared by different blood centers was feasible. However, the authors observed that such a screening did not allow the prevention of the transfusion of contaminated units because of the interval of time needed after inoculation and the detection of the contaminant. In addition, the risk of false negative results was not eliminated by this approach.7 Two cases of life-threatening sepsis due to Bacillus cereus contamination despite the BacT/ALERT\u00ae detection method were described by te Boekhorst et al. in the Netherlands.15",

Over a period of two years, 28,104 pooled platelets were screened: 203 of them were detected as being contaminated and 125 out of 203 had already been released at the time of the detection. Ninety percent of them were already transfused. No adverse reactions such as fever, hypotension, or other unexplained clinical deterioration, were observed after a contaminated transfusion. Early detection (\u226448 hours) of bacterial contamination with microbiological confirmation was possible in 59 concentrates, and 48 of them could be recalled. For late detection (>48 hours), only 33 of 125 contaminated concentrates could be recalled. The authors also observed that 68% of the BacT/ALERT\u00ae screening cultures became positive after an incubation of 48 hours.15 They noted that this low rate was in contrast with several studies that showed higher rates of bacterial detection after an incubation of 48 hours. For instance, Wagner and Robinette showed that deliberate bacterial inoculation in platelet concentrates could be detected after 48 hours in all of the cases.15,23 Brecher et al. reported detection of inoculated microorganisms in apheresis platelet units (with the exception of Propionibacterium acnes) in a mean time of 9.3\u201318.9 hours (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7\u201318.2 hours (100 CFU/mL).15,24 Te Boekhorst et al. pointed out the fact that this difference could be explained by a presumably very low bacterial load in their platelet concentrates compared to the experimental inoculation load.15",

The results were compared with the BacT/ALERT\u00ae system, considered in this study as a reference. Low levels (5\u201350 CFU/mL) of 5 different strains of bacteria were inoculated in the platelet units. The platelets were stored at 22\u00b0C, 24 hours before sampling. Time to detection ranged between 8\u201317 hours. Sixty-three contaminated bags were incubated for 18 and 24 hours at 35\u00b0C. Sixty-one out of 63 (96.82%) were detected as being positive after 18 hours and all at 24 hours. The O2 level of the 2 samples negative at 18 hours (contaminated with Bacillus cereus) was near the detection threshold. However, the negative samples detected an O2 level >17%. There were no false positive results (100% specificity).

A microbiological reference laboratory evaluated all initially positive results. This evaluation revealed a better sensitivity for the BacT/ALERT\u00ae system, identifying 4 positive samples that were missed with the Pall eBDS\u00ae. However, the enhanced sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT\u00ae system was offset by a reduced specificity which was defined in this study as the number of false-positive test samples. The specificity of BacT/ALERT\u00ae (0.25%, 28 out of 11,037 tested samples) was significantly lower compared to Pall eBDS\u00ae (0.03%, 3 out of 11,037 tested samples). However, the authors concluded that this reduced specificity might be acceptable. BacT/ALERT\u00ae detected 32 positive samples with microbiological confirmation out of 11,037 and Pall eBDS\u00ae detected one positive sample. These samples were considered as initially positive. However, these initially positive results were not confirmed by the analysis of a second sample, either from the satellite bag, or from the original platelet bag, or from a related erythrocyte bag (in case of pooled platelet). A possible explanation may be an exogenous contamination during the test procedure. For that reason, Pall eBDS\u00ae which is a closed system may be preferable to BacT/ALERT\u00ae which is an open one.",

Riboflavin is a natural component found in food (milk, beer, eggs, yeasts, leafy vegetables), and is classified as a \u201cGenerally-Regarded-As-Safe\u201d compound by the FDA.30,43,44 Riboflavin interacts with nucleic acids after exposure to UV light (280\u2013360 nm) and causes irreversible damage to DNA/RNA (direct electron transfer, production of singlet oxygen and production of hydrogen peroxide leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals). A compound adsorbing device removal process for residual riboflavine metabolites may not be necessary.30,43 Perez-Pujol et al. have studied the impact of this method on the functional and biochemical characteristics of platelet concentrates. They observed, with flow cytometry studies, the same changes in treated and non-treated platelets, without modification of FvW, fibrinogen and FVa levels after five days of storage. They also showed that treated platelets have adhesive and cohesive functions similar to non-treated platelets.45 Ruane et al. have shown that the Mirasol\u00ae PRT system is able to inactivate viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates. They observed significant log reductions for cell-associated and cell-free HIV, West Nile virus, porcine parvovirus, and for gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis or Escherichia coli. The authors noted that the platelet pH and the lactate production rate were, as suggested by the literature data, predictive of recoveries in 50.8\u201359.8%. Therefore, they used platelet pH and lactate production rate as platelet quality indicators and concluded that platelet cell quality was maintained after treatment and during storage.46 Goodrich et al. reviewed Mirasol\u00ae PRT performances and confirmed that this system was able to inactivate viruses and various bacteria species such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens. These data suggested a significant reduction of the risk of platelet related bacteria transmission.16,44,47 Kumar et al. showed an increased genomic DNA degradation in leukocytes and bacteria after riboflavin and UV light treatment,48 also suggesting that Mirasol\u00ae PRT technology may be an alternative to gamma irradiation to prevent transfusion associated graft-versus-host disease.43",

Moreover, gamma irradiation of blood components performed to eliminate the risk of transfusion associated graft-versus-host disease could be eliminated.
