The case in question featured an individual in which the infection is believed to have progressed to full-blown AIDS within a short time scale of between 4 and 20 months. In addition to the speed of progression from infection to disease, despite the fact that the individual had not received any antiviral treatment, this strain of HIV is resistant to three of the four main classes of antivirals that are commonly used to treat HIV infection. The combination of multidrug resistance and rapid progression to disease prompted officials to issue the health alert as a 'wake-up call' to at-risk populations in the city. The overall significance of the case remains unclear, however, with some researchers believing it may prove to be an isolated case. Reuters",

In an effort to simplify immunization, researchers have been investigating the feasibility of producing an oral, edible vaccine. Previous work had established that an immune response was elicited in mice fed on transgenic potato tubers expressing the hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg). Now, the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial have been reported in PNAS. Of the 33 previously vaccinated volunteers involved in the trial to receive the edible vaccine rather than placebo, an increase in serum antibody titre to HbSAg was observed in 19 individuals. This prototype study indicates that an edible vaccine strategy for HepB may be worth pursuing. PNAS",

A report in The New England Journal of Medicine described a case of fatal H5N1 infection in a child in Vietnam, which indicates that the clinical spectrum of H5N1 infection is much broader than was previously thought. The patient initially presented with symptoms of gastroenteritis and encephalitis, with no respiratory symptoms. The diagnosis of H5N1 influenza was made when the virus was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and faecal samples, as well as from serum and throat specimens. This unusual presentation indicates that the number of avian influenza cases may have been underestimated. The ongoing outbreak continues in Vietnam, and surveillance has been increased in Cambodia in response to the detection of the first human case of avian influenza in the country. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture have issued a statement to the press detailing the development of an H5N1 vaccine, which they say provides effective protection in birds. NEJM/\nReuters",

In Germany, rabies is an extremely rare disease; however, the donor is believed to have recently returned from a period of travelling in India, where rabies causes around 30,000 deaths per year.
