            "text": "Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses that are enveloped and contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 27 to 31.5 kb in length. The genome of coronaviruses is polycistronic and possesses a 5\u2032-cap structure and a 3\u2032-poly (A) tail [1]. At the 5\u2032-end, the two large open reading frames (ORFs) (1a and 1b) comprise about two-thirds of the entire coronaviruses genome, which encode the viral replicase and are translated directly from the genomic RNA [2]. Besides four essential structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), the 3\u2032-one-third of the genome comprises variable number of group-specific genes, which are expressed through a set of nested 3\u2032-coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (Fig. 1a). A key feature of these sgRNAs is that their 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminal sequences are identical to those of the genome. This nested set structure results from a fusion of the sequence representing the genomic 5\u2032-end (leader sequence) and sequences representing different 3\u2032-regions of the genome, the so-called mRNA bodies (body sequences). Though the 5\u2032-end of genome greatly affects coronavirus discontinuous transcription to produce sgRNAs [3], the regulatory mechanism of coronavirus gene expression is not well understood. \n",

In our previous work, we identified 10 sgRNAs from SARS-CoV-infected cells and showed that the transcription of sgRNAs was in a discontinuous manner at the stage of negative strand synthesis [5]. As all the sgRNAs contain a common leader of about 72 nucleotides (nt), it is still not clear how expressions of the 3\u2032-proximal genes are controlled at the translational level. Revelation of the translational control mechanism will help to explain the roles of the group-specific genes and their encoded accessory proteins in viral life cycle and pathogenesis.",

Elucidation of the regulatory mechanism in the translation is important for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV; however, it is hard to compare the differential translation of sgRNAs because the steady-state level of viral proteins in infected cells reflects the sum of transcription, translation, and the relative stabilities of these transcriptional and translational products. In this study, we adopted the reporter gene system by fusing with partial sgRNA ORF of similar size under the control of the same promoter. This system was supposed to specifically address and compare the translation efficiency of individual sgRNAs by circumventing the problem resulted from different transcription efficiency and protein stability.",

The predicted start codon AUG of each ORF was cloned in-frame with the GFP gene and the start codon of GFP was replaced with GUG. Strong fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with fusion constructs p2/S, p2-1, p3/3a, p5/M, p6, p4/E, and p9/N, whereas relatively weak fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with fusion constructs p3-1, p7/7a, and p8 (Fig. 3a). Expressions of GFP-fusion proteins of expected sizes were detected in cells transfected with plasmids p2-1, p3/3a, p3-1, p4/E, p5/M, p6, p7/7a, and p9/N (Fig. 3b). The major protein band of sgRNA 2-GFP fusion construct (Fig. 3b) was larger than theoretically calculated size (Table 2). This discrepancy could be due to the post-translational modification of protein or not fully denatured protein complex. One minor band below the major band may represent the correct fusion translation product (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, protein bands with smaller sizes were detected in cells transfected with constructs of p3/3a, p4/E, and p5/M, which might result from leaky expression from downstream AUG codons, premature termination or degradation product by cellular proteinases (Fig. 3b). \n\n",

These results suggest that more GFP was translated from downstream start codon in p6 transfected cells as compared to p7/7a transfected cells.

Leaky scanning allows the translation of multiple ORFs from a common mRNA substrate, and such leaky scanning has already been reported for viral RNA translation [17, 18]. For coronaviruses, it has been reported that the SARS-CoV ORF7b and the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) ORF3b are translated by leaky ribosomal scanning [19, 20]. Our data showed that leaky scanning, which leads to translation from downstream AUG codon, may be common for coronavirus RNAs. Messenger RNAs in which the first AUG codon lacks the preferred nucleotide at both of the key positions (\u22123, +4) in the Kozak context have the special property of initiating translation at the first and downstream AUG codons, thereby producing two or more proteins from one mRNA. Further studies are needed to investigate the translation of downstream ORFs as well as the role of truncated proteins (if any such protein exists in SARS-CoV infected cells) expressed from downstream AUG codons by leaky scanning.",

            "text": "Although SARS-CoV 8b gene product could be expressed in vivo when cloned directly behind a promoter [11\u201313]; the expression of 8a and 8b in SARS-CoV-infected cells is still controversial [9, 10, 13]. As shown above, we were unable to detect the protein expression of sgRNA 8 with the 5\u2032 viral leader sequence, which corroborated with a recent report on ORF8 expression [13]. Cells transfected with p8 displayed significant fluorescence (Figs. 3a, 5a), but the expression of fusion protein could not be detected in western blot (Fig. 5b). To investigate a possible role of the sgRNA8 5\u2032-UTR in translation, the 5\u2032-UTR of sgRNA 8 was replaced by the 5\u2032-UTR of sgRNA 5 to create the plasmid p8/5 because the initiator AUG codon of sgRNA 5 was shown to be functional (Fig. 3b), and the length and the secondary structure of both 5\u2032-UTRs were predicted to be similar to sgRNA 8 5\u2032-UTR. Interestingly, the replacement of the 5\u2032-UTR resulted in the translation of fusion protein from initiator AUG codon of ORF 8b. As expected, when the 5\u2032-UTR of sgRNA 5 was replaced by the 5\u2032-UTR of sgRNA 8 to create the plasmid p5/8, the expression of p5/8 could not be detected (Fig. 5b). We speculated that a small ORF (8a), which is present in the 5\u2032-UTR of sgRNA 8, might play a role in translational suppression from downstream initiator AUG codon of ORF 8b. To study any possible role of upstream ORF in translation suppression, the GFP was fused with ORF 8a to create the plasmid p8a but no fusion protein was detected in cells transfected with this recombinant plasmid (Fig. 5b). This shows that translational suppression from the initiator AUG codon of ORF 8b was not the result of the expression of 8a but could be due to other cis-acting elements present in the 5\u2032-UTR region. Taken together, these data indicate that the 5\u2032-UTR may act as a suppression regulatory element that led to the inhibition of expression of both ORF 8a and 8b in sgRNA 8. \n",

            "text": "As the expression levels of SARS-CoV sgRNAs were significantly different, we determined whether the sequence context around the start codon AUG (Kozak sequence) plays an important role in the translation of sgRNAs. The optimal context for initiation of translation in vertebrate mRNAs is ACCAUGG [14, 15]. In this consensus motif, two nucleotides at the highly conserved positions (a G residue following the AUG codon (position +4) and a purine, preferably A, three nucleotides upstream AUG condon (position \u22123)) exert the strongest effect. Sequence analysis revealed that AUG codons of sgRNAs 2-1, 5/M and 8 are in better Kozak context (Table 2). They have only one nucleotide mismatch with the consensus sequence motif ACCAUGG. A pyrimidine (C) is present at position \u22123 in sgRNA 2-1, whereas a mismatch at position \u22122 and \u22121 is present in sgRNA 5 and 8 respectively (Table 2). However, sgRNA 8 has a low-translation efficiency as shown above. The sequence surrounding the AUG initiator codon of sgRNAs 2 and 7 has two nucleotides mismatch with consensus Kozak sequence, and notably they are lacking a guanine (G) at position +4. The sgRNAs 3, 3-1, 4, 6 and 9 possess poor Kozak sequence context for translation initiation (Table 2) but most could be translated efficiently (Fig. 3b). Taken together, no significant correlation was found between the Kozak context around AUG initiator codon of sgRNAs and the translational level of the fusion proteins.",

All SARS-CoV sgRNAs contain the same leader sequence but the 5\u2032-UTR lengths are variable, ranging from 72 nt to 265 nt (Table 2).

Therefore, further studies are required to determine the relationship between the level of transcription, translation, and relative abundance of protein in cells which were infected by SARS-CoV. At the translational step, our data showed that translation from the downstream initiator codon by leaky scanning was common to SARS-CoV sgRNAs and this could lead to synthesis of truncated viral protein products (if the downstream AUG is in the same reading frame) or altered proteins, which may act as decoys to fool immune system and favor viral replication.",
