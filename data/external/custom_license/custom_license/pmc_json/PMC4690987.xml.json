The choice has been made based on the pKa values of the N,N-dimethylpropan-amine\nside chains: the pKa values are above\n7 (pKa1 = 8.1, pKa2 = 8.6),52 suggesting that the\nside chains are mainly protonated under physiological conditions.\nThis aspect ensures good solubilizing properties, reducing self-aggregations.\nWe discharged the shorter N,N-dimethylthyl-amine\nside chains, as their pKa values are much\nlower (pKa1 = 5.6, pKa2 = 7.4). The c-exNDIs are structurally\ncharacterized by a larger flat core than the NDIs. This feature should\nimprove \u03c0-stacking interaction implementing the binding to the\nG4. Indeed, DFT calculation performed at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of\ntheory in gas phase indicated that the dimension of the c-exNDI core supported a more extensive overlap to the quartet of the G4\nstructure (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Enhancement of the ligand steric hindrance accessing the outside\nG4 quartets might offer an opportunity to implement selectivity as\nwell. Furthermore, the proposed structural extension on the NDI scaffold\nshould merge the useful optoelectronic properties (absorption, emission,\nand singlet oxygen sensitizer) of functionalized NDIs to those of\nsubstituted dihydrobenzophenazines. Compounds with both H and Br substituents\nat the Y position were considered to evaluate the effect of a bulky\nsubstituent (Br) at this position. To synthesize the c-exNDIs, we developed the synthetic protocol highlighted in Scheme 2. According to published methods,\nthe imidation reaction of the readily available 2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic\ndianhydride yielded the 2,6-dibromo-substituted NDI, under acidic\nconditions, in almost quantitative yield. Subsequently, a two-step\nprotocol starting from a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) in the presence of an excess (2.5 equiv) of ortho-diaminophenyl derivatives in DMF as solvent at 70 \u00b0C for 16\nh afforded a 60:40 mixture of monobrominated and debrominated products\nin an overall quantitative yield. The ring closing reaction following\nthe SNAr in one pot (step a, in Scheme 2) occurred through a Tchitchibabin mechanism,\nwith the elimination of hydride favored by the formation of a six-membered\nring. The second SNAr on the remaining aromatic bromide\nwas carried out by dissolving 3 in neat N1,N1-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine.\nTo improve the reaction yield, we optimized a microwave-assisted protocol\n(150 \u00b0C, 200 psi, 250 bar, 200 W, 3 min, sealed reaction vessels)\nto give product 9, which crystallized from the reaction\nmixture. We achieved the synthesis of the permanently charged quaternary\nammonium salts 10 and 11 with a classical\nexhaustive methylation, in the presence of MeI at rt for 16 h. All\nthe synthesized ligands (2\u201311) were\npurified by preparative HPLC (CH3CN:H2O and\n0.1% CF3COOH as eluent). Further anion exchange yielded 2\u20139 as hydrochloride salts.

When embedded within the full-length G-rich sequence of the LTR\npromoter, LTR-III is the most stable G4, while LTR-IV folds when induced\nby G4 ligands.27 A FRET melting assay was\nperformed to assess the degree of stabilization of the LTR-III and\nLTR-IV G4 by c-exNDIs. The minimal intramolecular G4-forming\nhuman telomeric (hTel) sequence (Figure 1A) was employed to evaluate the activity\nof the c-exNDIs on one of the most highly represented\nand accessible cellular G4: in fact, the TTAGGG repeat is present\nas 2000\u20133000 double-stranded (ds) and 50\u2013200 single-stranded\nsequences at the human telomeres.53 A double-stranded\n(ds) DNA was also added to address specificity toward the G4 conformation\n(Supporting Information, Table S1). While\nthis kind of assay is typically performed using molar excess of the\ntested compounds, we here initially employed equimolar amounts of\nthe target DNA sequence and compounds (i.e., 0.25 \u03bcM) to better\ndifferentiate the stabilization efficiency among the different c-exNDIs. The melting temperatures of the LTR-III, LTR-IV,\nhTel, and dsDNA G4 conformations were sufficiently similar (66.9,\n61.9, 66.9, and 66.5 \u00b0C, respectively) to allow a meaningful\ncomparison. In the presence of the c-exNDIs, a marked\nincrease in the stabilization of the G4-forming oligonucleotides was\nobserved (Figure 1B\nand Supporting Information, Table S2).\nAmong the tested c-exNDIs, 2, 3, 4, 10, and 11 were the most\nefficient ligands, with a stabilization on LTR-IV G4 of 10\u201316\n\u00b0C at equimolar amounts. At 4-fold c-exNDI:DNA molar\nratio, the stabilization increased to above 25 \u00b0C, which is the\nmaximum increase measurable in these settings (data not shown). The\nother c-exNDIs showed intermediate (4 \u00b0C \u2264\n\u0394Tm < 7 \u00b0C, 5, 6, and 7), or low (\u0394Tm < 4 \u00b0C, 8 and 9) level\nof stabilization on LTR-IV G4. Compounds 2 and 10 stabilized LTR-III G4 above 10 \u00b0C. Among the G4 structures,\nhTel G4 was the least efficiently stabilized, whereas stabilization\non dsDNA was negligible. Only compounds 10 and 11 displayed a significant stabilization on dsDNA, indicating\nthat the presence of two permanent charges (the quaternary ammonium\nmoieties) favors an unspecific binding to the negatively charged nucleic\nacid. In general, the H series of all derivatives (Y = H, 2, 4, 6, 10; Scheme 2) was more active and more\nselective for the viral G4s compared to the Br substituted ones (Y\n= Br, 3, 5, 7, 8; Scheme 2). Compounds 2, 3, and 10 exhibited a difference\nin stabilization of LTR-IV G4s vs hTel G4 equal or above 6 \u00b0C,\nwhich roughly corresponds to 40% of the overall stabilization efficiency\n(Figure 1B and Supporting\nInformation, Table S2).",

We first confirmed\nby CD analysis that in the buffer conditions used for the ESI/MS experiments\nthe topology of the G4-folded oligonucleotides did not significantly\nmodify (Supporting Information, Figure S3) Equimolar amounts of LTR-III/hTel, LTR-IV/hTel, and LTR-III/LTR-IV\nG4s were incubated with 2-fold molar excess of compounds 2 or 4. Because ESI/MS transfers intact biomolecules\ncomplexes in the gas phase and signal intensity is proportional to\nthe abundance of each species in solution, the ratio between m/z signals of each bound species and the\ncorresponding bound and free G4 (Figure 2A) was calculated (Table 1). While LTR-III and LTR-IV were detected\nmostly as all-bound species, hTel was mostly unbound (Figure 2A, and Supporting Information, Figures S4A and S4B). This analysis clearly shows\nthat our c-exNDIs preferentially bind the two viral sequences\nover the telomeric sequence. To corroborate the selectivity toward\nthe viral sequences, two additional cellular G4 folding sequences\nwere evaluated: c-kit257 and c-myc.32 The LTR G4s were preferred over c-kit2 G4 by\nboth compounds; in the case of c-myc G4, compound 4 preferentially\nbound to the LTR G4s, whereas compound 2 showed more\nintense binding to c-myc (Table 1). Therefore, we confirmed a general, even though not\nabsolute, selectivity toward the LTR G4s. It is also possible that\nthe much higher stability of the c-myc G4 (Tm > 95 \u00b0C) vs the stability of the other tested G4s\n(LTR-III\n66.9 \u00b0C, LTR-IV 61.9 \u00b0C, c-kit2 72.1 \u00b0C) played a role\nin this result. When the two LTR G4s were competed with each other,\nthe LTR-III sequence was preferred. At 2-fold excess of compound,\nLTR-III bound up to two molecules of compounds, whereas only one molecule\nwas obtained for both LTR-IV and hTel (Figure 2, and Supporting Information, Figure S5). At saturating concentrations (10-fold\nmolar excess), three molecules were bound to LTR-III G4, whereas up\nto two molecules could bind LTR-IV and hTel G4s (Supporting Information, Figure S5).",

To this end, we evaluated the protection\nexerted by compound 2 over residues of the LTR G4s against\nclerocidin (CL). This molecule has been shown to alkylate DNA single-stranded\nG, C, and A bases58,59 and to be able to predict G4\nstructural folding.60 Labeled oligonucleotides\nwere folded, treated with increasing amounts of 2, exposed\nto CL, and further treated with piperidine to highlight CL-alkylated\nsites. In these settings, we expected to visualize only loop bases\nbound by the c-exNDI because base-paired Gs involved\nin G-quartet formation would not be available to CL alkylation, independently\nof the presence of the compound. The NMR structure of LTR-IV has been\nsolved (PDB code 2N4Y), and therefore we were able to assess that nucleotides affected\nby the presence of the c-exNDI were in two loops of the\nstructure: in particular, in the ACTG loop the A base was protected,\nwhereas C and G were exposed; in the 1-base-loop, the C base was exposed\n(Figure 2C and 2E). The structure of LTR-III has not been solved\nyet, however, previous data indicated that this G4 can fold into different\nconformations, the main one of which is likely the one depicted in Figure 2E, as detected by\nlow-resolution structural data.27 In this\ncase, we observed protection of the C base in the ACTG loop (Figure 2D), which is shared\nwith the LTR-IV sequence (see Figure 1A); three additional residues (C, C, and G) were protected\nin the 11-base-loop (Figure 2D and 2E). Protection and exposure\nof residues indicated specific interaction of 2 at the\naffected LTR sites. Interestingly, unique LTR loops and in particular\nthe ACTG loop shared by both LTR-III and LTR-IV, and absent in the\ntelomeric sequence, were involved, indicating that these are likely\nthe moieties that induce selectivity. We cannot exclude that other\nregions are bound by the c-exNDI, but probably the interaction\nat other sites is less stable or more dynamic so that a clear protection/exposure\ncould not be observed.",

Given\nthe c-exNDI binding/stabilization selectivity observed\nin vitro for the viral G4s vs the cellular G4, we set out to investigate\nthe anti-HIV-1 activity of the newly synthesized c-exNDI derivatives. Compound entry was preliminarily measured by phase\ncontrast and fluorescence microscopy, taking advantage of the blue-colored c-exNDI dyes (\u03bbabs = 555 and 600 nm, for\nthe unsubstituted 2) and their red fluorescence emission\n(\u03bbem = 610 and 655 nm, for 2). After\n30 min of incubation, compounds concentrated into the cell (Supporting\nInformation, Figure S7). We next treated\ninfected cells with increasing amounts of compounds and measured virus\nproduction; concurrently, the cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the c-exNDIs in the same conditions but on uninfected\ncells was measured by MTT assay. All compounds were tested against\nthe HIV-1 NL4-3 strain, which is a X4 strain. Results are reported\nin Table 2. Compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 displayed\ninhibitory concentration (IC50) values below 25 nM. Compound 2 displayed a promising SI of 40, the best among the tested c-exNDIs, whereas SI values of compound 3, 4, and 5 were around 20, again superior to 1. Derivatives 6 and 7 exhibited\nlow activity and low cytotoxicity, while 9 showed the\nworst combination with low activity, high cytotoxicity, and SI of\n2.2. We also evaluated the range of concentration (therapeutic window\nor TW), at which we obtained antiviral activity paralleled by less\nthan 80% cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 3A, 2 displayed the widest TW\n(3.9\u2013250 nM); 4 and 5 also showed\ninteresting TW values; TW concentrations for 6 and 7, which are likely to be mainly monoanionic under physiological\nconditions as both the (CH2)3NHMe2+ moieties exhibit a pKa >8.1,52 were in the \u03bcM range; no TW was observed\nfor 8 and 9 (Table 1). Finally, 10 and 11, containing two quaternary ammonium moieties, did not display any\nantiviral or cytotoxic activity likely due to their inability to enter\nthe cells, as already shown for NDIs with permanent positive charges.61 Compound 2 and 3 were\nalso tested on the HIV-1 BaL strain, a R5 strain with a different\ntropism. In this case, IC50 values below 40 nM were obtained,\nwith SI of 14 for the H derivative (Table 1). Note that the H series of all derivatives\nwas more active than the Br substituted one. Moreover, all compounds\ndisplayed CC50 values higher than 2 \u03bcM against a\nhuman fibroblast cell line.",

First, most of the new compounds displayed improved stabilization\non G4 structures, with substantial increments in Tm above values previously reported for NDI derivatives.41\u221246 This feature is an indication that the expansion of the aromatic\nsurface allows a more effective recognition of the G4 structure. This\nmay be due to a more extensive overlap to the quartet of the G4 structure,\nas inferred by the dimension of the c-exNDI core, evaluated\nby DFT calculation (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Second, these compounds exhibited a very promising antiviral\nactivity. Compared to 1,30 the best antiviral 2\u20135 showed improved\nIC50 values (in the low nM vs low \u03bcM range). This\nfeature may derive from the selectivity observed in vitro for the\nLTR G4s over the telomeric G4 structures. The viral and telomeric\nG4s are likely the two most abundant DNA G4 species in the cell during\ninfection, therefore a preferential effect on the viral G4s would\nresult in higher antiviral activity and lower cytotoxicity, as observed.\nThe c-exNDIs displayed both selective binding affinity\nand stabilization for the viral G4s. Between the two LTR G4s, the\nLTR-III sequence was most efficiently bound by 2, as\nmeasured by ESI/MS and SPR. Even though LTR-III (38 nts) and LTR-IV\n(29 nts) display an identical number of G-quartets, LTR-III offers\nlonger loops that may accommodate additional molecules and therefore\nmay display increased binding affinity. Indeed, at saturating concentrations,\nbinding of up to three c-exNDI molecules was observed\nby ESI/MS with LTR-III compared to two molecules for LTR-IV. In addition,\ntwo loops in both LTR-III and LTR-IV G4s were shown to be involved\nin c-exNDI interaction by footprinting analyses. We suggest\nthat the compounds interact with the edge G-quartets through the core\nNDI planar aromatic surface, while the extended moiety and side chains\ninteract with the side loops, affording selectivity toward the LTR\nG4s. To our knowledge, this is the first example of this type of selectivity\nbased on chemical recognition of specific residues; in fact, previously\nreported selectivity rather relied on the recognition of a G4 conformation.65",

The Br group may both\nhinder specific interactions (hence lower selectivity) and partially\ndistort the aromatic core from planarity (hence lower G4 binding);\n(iii) the pyridine ring in place of the benzene in the extended core\nis strongly detrimental (compound 8). The fair antiviral\nactivity is paralleled by moderate cytotoxicity, allowing no TW, possibly\ndue to off-target activity; (iv) the NO2 moiety is allowed\n(compounds 4 and 5) as compound 4 is the most powerful and selective ligand toward LTR-III; (v) the\nnegatively charged carboxylate group decrease the electrostatic component\nof the binding to the DNA G4s (compounds 6 and 7); (vi) on the contrary, the permanently positively charged\nammonium groups extensively increase binding to the target G4s by\nadding electrostatic interaction (compounds 10 and 11). However, compounds with permanent charges are not suitable\nfor cell entry and hence cannot be exploited for antiviral purposes.\nA scheme of the chemical properties that lead to high-affinity recognition\nand selectivity of the c-exNDI binders is reported in\nthe graphical abstract.",
