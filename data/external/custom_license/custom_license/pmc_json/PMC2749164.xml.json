As a result of different definitions, comparisons, lack of reporting of cluster coefficients, and, in two cases, missing data for participants,23\n24 meta-analysis was not feasible. Three of the trials reported a lack of effect for the prevention of acute respiratory illness: risk ratios 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 2.43),24 0.97 (0.72 to 1.30),22 and 1.10 (0.97 to 1.24).31 A possible explanation for the lack of effect is that because exposure to respiratory viruses is ubiquitous, repeated hand hygiene would be needed, which is not practical in busy settings such as schools. Nevertheless, the highest quality trials reported a significant decrease in respiratory illness in children aged up to 24 months (risk ratio 0.90, 0.83 to 0.97), although the decrease was not significant in older children (0.95, 0.89 to 1.01),21 and a 50% (\u221265% to \u221234%) lower incidence of pneumonia in children aged less than 5 years in a low income country.20 Another study reported a decrease in respiratory tract infections of up to 38% with additional hand rubbing with benzalkonium chloride (risk ratios 0.69 for incidence of absence due to illness and 0.71 for duration of absence).26 One study reported a 43% reduction in absenteeism from school with the use of alcohol gel in addition to handwashing.25 Repeated handwashing significantly reduced the incidence of colds by as much as 20% in two trials.23\n73",

A community trial also reported a non-significant reduction in secondary attack rates of acute respiratory tract infection (18.7% v 11.8%) during high circulation of influenza H3N2 and rhinoviruses in the community.28 This result is likely to be an underestimate because of the barrier effect of the untreated tissue wipes used as control.",

The authors suggest that gargling with water is effective against mild forms of acute respiratory tract infection but not the more severe forms. The incidence rate ratio for gargling with water was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.99) and for gargling with povidone-iodine was 0.89 (0.60 to 1.33). The authors also found that gargling with water may attenuate the symptoms of the disease. Gargling with povidone-iodine seemed to affect compliance because two participants switched to using water. Perhaps this potentially important study, totalling 387 participants in three arms, should be repeated in a larger population and with clearer reporting.",

Under the assumption that the incubation period is equal to one day (the most probable value for the two most common viruses isolated, influenza n=21 and rhinovirus n=26), adherence to the use of P2 or surgical masks significantly reduced the risk of influenza-like illness, with a hazard ratio of 0.26 (0.09 to 0.77; P=0.015).

Homogeneity of case definition, agent, settings, and outcomes allowed meta-analysis (table 2, figure). Binary data were pooled; as none of the comparisons showed significant heterogeneity, a fixed effects model was used. Although continuous data were often available, the variables were different and measured in different units, with standard deviations usually missing, which made meta-analysis impossible. Studies reported that disinfection of living quarters was highly effective in preventing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.39)32; handwashing for a minimum of 11 times daily prevented most cases (0.45, 0.36 to 0.57; all six studies),32\n33\n34\n35\n37\n38 wearing simple masks was highly effective (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; five studies),32\n33\n34\n35\n38 wearing N95 masks was even more effective (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; two studies)33\n37, wearing gloves was effective (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; three studies),33\n35\n37 wearing gowns was also effective (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; four studies),33\n35\n37\n38 and all approaches combined achieved high effectiveness (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; two studies).33\n37 All studies selected cases from hospitals, except one32 which chose cases of probable severe acute respiratory syndrome reported to the Department of Health in Hong Kong. A seventh case-control study36 assessed the impact of environmental, administrative, and host factors in 86 wards in 21 hospitals in Guangzhou and 38 wards in five hospitals in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic. Six significant risk factors were identified: minimum distance between beds of 1 m or less (odds ratio 6.94, 1.68 to 28.75), availability of washing or changing facilities for staff (0.12, 0.02 to 0.97), whether resuscitation was ever done on the ward (3.81, 1.04 to 13.87), whether staff worked while they had symptoms (10.55, 2.28 to 48.87), whether any index patient or the first patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome admitted to a ward required oxygen therapy (4.30, 1.00 to 18.43), and whether any index patients required bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation (11.82, 1.97 to 70.80).",

Perhaps more than the addition of portable virucidal hand foam as an adjunct to handwashing, one educational programme on handwashing for staff of a day care centre for adults was effective in reducing rates of respiratory tract infection from 14.5-10.4 per 100 person months to 5.7 (P<0.001), with an accompanying decline in viral isolates.41 This confirmed an earlier report on the effectiveness of a handwashing programme in reducing absenteeism due to influenza-like illness in a primary school.46",

Volunteers subjected to the intervention hand cleaner (organic acids) were not allowed to use their hands between cleaning and virus challenge, so the effect of normal use of the hands on the intervention remains unknown.17 Although 2% aqueous iodine is a successful antiviral intervention when painted on the hands it causes cosmetic staining and is impractical for all but those at the highest risk of epidemic contagion.16 Compliance with interventions, especially with educational programmes and N95 masks, was a problem in several studies. N95 masks also caused harm such as rash and acne, further limiting the compliance of healthcare workers.59 Routine long term implementation of some of the measures assessed in this review would be problematic, particularly maintaining strict hygiene and barrier routines for long periods. In the absence of a real threat of a serious epidemic, this would probably be feasible only in highly motivated environments, such as hospitals. Most of the study authors commented on the considerable logistic burden imposed by barrier routines at the community level.",

Perhaps this is because younger children are least capable of hygienic behaviour and have longer lived infections and greater social contact, thereby acting as portals of infection into the household.21 Additional benefit from reduced transmission from children to other members of the household is broadly supported by the results of other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. The seven case-control studies suggest that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures are effective with the use of relatively cheap interventions to contain epidemics of respiratory viruses. We found limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of barrier devices to droplets such as the N95 masks over simple surgical masks. N95 masks are respirators with 95% filtration capability against non-oily particulate aerosols.38 Although they are more expensive and uncomfortable (especially if worn for long periods) than simple surgical masks, they may be useful in high risk situations. We are aware of at least one randomised trial comparing different masks for influenza (NCT00756574).",

The extra benefit may have been, at least in part, accrued by confounding additional routines. Studies preventing transmission of respiratory syncytial virus and similar viruses seemed to be closer to real life and suggest good effectiveness of physical barriers. However, concerns about the methodological quality of the controlled before and after studies suggest that the benefits may have been caused by differences in the populations, especially in virus infection rates. These were poorly reported in most studies. The effectiveness of gargling with water compared with an antiseptic should be tested further in a larger trial with better masking of the possible addition of the antiseptic liquid.",

Public health recommendations are almost completely based on the use of vaccines and antivirals despite the lack of strong evidence.1 Vaccines work best in those who are universally considered least to need them10\u2014namely, healthy adults. Antivirals may be harmful and their benefits depend on the identification of the agent (influenza).8 But physical interventions are effective, safe, flexible, universally applicable, and relatively cheap. There are many complex reasons for this disparity. Influenza vaccines, for instance, target only a limited proportion of influenza-like illnesses (around 10% to 7%).7\n8 The comparative rarity of influenza as a cause of influenza-like illness affects the calculation of the effectiveness of influenza specific vaccines and antivirals. If the incidence of influenza in the unvaccinated population is low then the vaccine effectiveness ratio will be close to 1 and effectiveness low. However, physical interventions are directed against all viral diseases and therefore calculation of their effectiveness is sensitive only to the incidence of influenza-like illness, not of influenza. In addition, physical interventions are relatively cheap. The cost of masks ranges from $0.16 (\u00a30.09; \u20ac0.11) to $1.9 each depending on make and complexity, from soft surgical masks to N95 masks.74 Prices are higher for well known brands and different designs and materials, although bulk purchase would result in sizeable discounts.",

Further large scale pragmatic trials to evaluate the best combinations are clearly required. Funding for these studies remains a problem, however. Randomised controlled trials with a pragmatic design, similar to the trial by Luby et al,20 should be carried out whenever possible. Perhaps the impressive effect of hygienic measures aimed at younger children is based on their poor capability of being hygienic.
