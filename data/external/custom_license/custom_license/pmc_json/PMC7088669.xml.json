From these, RVA is the most prevalent (Papp et al. 2013). The non-enveloped virion has a triple-layered capsid surrounding 11 dsRNA segments that encode 6 structural (VP1\u20134, VP6, and VP7) and 5 non-structural (NSP1-NSP5/6) proteins (Attoui et al. 2011). Since VP4 and VP7 induce the production of neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity, these proteins play a central role in strain selection for vaccine production and form the basis of a binary classification system, namely, the G (glycosylated) and P (protease-sensitive) genotypes (Estes and Greenberg 2013). To date, 27 G and 38 P genotypes with different combinations have been described (Matthijnssens et al. 2011; Trojnar et al. 2013). Regarding bovine rotavirus infections, G6, G8, and G10 together with P[1], P[5], and P[11], respectively, are the G and P genotypes most commonly found (Alkan et al. 2010).",

The vaccination of cows aims an increase of the concentration of specific antibodies in colostrum against targeted pathogens (Kaplon et al. 2013). Although many reports state that vaccination programs of pregnant cows are one of the main strategies for prevention of RVA diarrhea in calves, it must be kept in mind that calves that receive a sufficient quantity of specific antibodies through colostrum intake are not completely protected against rotavirus infection, instead, the severity of clinical signs is decreased, reducing deaths from RVA infection (Parre\u00f1o et al. 2004; Kaplon et al. 2013).",

This finding is relevant since most of the cross-sectional field research performed investigating RVA diarrhea, consider calves in which RVA is found in normal feces to be asymptomatic. In the report by Oliveira-Filho et al. (2007) and Cho et al. (2013), bovine RVA was only found in diarrheic feces, however, this sort of information is rare in the literature consulted, which can lead to misinformation. It is quite likely that newborn calves infected with RVA will always manifest an episode of diarrhea, and that the virus can be eliminated in all stages of clinical course of the disease, including in moments in which feces are normal. Thus, it would be relevant to perform more longitudinal studies in which fecal samples are taken in predetermined moments, as well as whenever the calves manifest diarrhea, in order to evaluate a larger number of animals to confirm these findings and if they are related to the virulence of genotypes of RVA.",

In the current study, considering the same age groups of calves, percentages found were 72.3 and 71% of normal consistency feces, 19.4 and 19% of semiliquid feces, and 8.30 and 10% of liquid feces, in groups V and NV, respectively. These authors also reported that the percentage of calves with diarrheic feces in the second week of life was higher than in calves with 1 or 3 weeks of age, which was similar to the findings of the present study, in which the percentage of diarrheic calves in their second week of life was 60.7%. This finding is attributable to the immune status of calves, which is higher in the first week of life due to passive immunity provided by colostrum, and gradually decreases through a natural process of catabolism of immunoglobulins, making calves more susceptible to infection in the second and third weeks of life. Since most cases of RVA diarrhea occur within these age groups, at 4 weeks of age, calves are normally immune to infection through natural resistance (Chase et al. 2008; Coura et al. 2015).",

In experimental studies, rotavirus excretion has been reported to last up to 10 days (Fernandez et al. 1998). This difference might be attributable to the method of detection of RVA in feces, since both field studies employed PAGE as a screening method for rotavirus in feces, and the limitation of this method lies in the need for a certain concentration of virus particles for the test to be positive, while in the experimental study cited, the method used (ELISA) is considered a test able to detect smaller amounts of virus present in feces than PAGE.",

According to Alkan et al. (2010), several factors can contribute to vaccine failures, especially vaccination management. In the present study, there was a special attention with the conservation and protocol of vaccination employed, in order to avoid the risk of vaccine failure due to inappropriate conservation of the vaccine or a longer period of time between the second dose of vaccine and parturition. However, contrary to expectations, incidence of rotavirus diarrhea was higher in group V than in group NV, which might be due to differences in herd size, exposure to virus, and management procedures between herds (Meganck et al. 2015).",

Although this might have impact in some of the economic costs associated with neonatal calf diarrhea, it does not reduce the expenses of treatment aiming to avoid secondary bacterial infections and might still impact on the potential development and performance of calves in their productive life, given that all the animals positive for RVA detection in the present study manifested at least one episode of diarrhea throughout the first month of life.",

Alkan et al. (2010) reported that the G6P[11] lineage found in Turkey formed a unique G6 lineage with only 90.1% amino acid identity to the G6 strain NCDV found in the vaccines. Medeiros et al. (2014a) also reported an outbreak of diarrhea in beef calves in Brazil caused by a G6P[11] distant from the most common lineages of RVA strains G6P[1] and G6P[5]. As the strain found in the vaccinated herd of the present study showed a nucleotide sequence identity of 91.2% to the vaccinal strain NCDV, and the VP4 antigen associated was different from the vaccinal strain, this could help to explain the lack of protection of the vaccinated herd against RVA diarrhea.",
