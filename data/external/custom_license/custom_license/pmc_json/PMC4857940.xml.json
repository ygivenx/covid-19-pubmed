Little is known regarding platelet, myocardial, or valvular 5HT concentration ([5HT]) in affected dogs. We sought to quantify [5HT] in platelet\u2010rich (PRP), platelet\u2010poor plasma (PPP), left ventricular myocardium (LV), and mitral valve leaflet tissue (MV) using HPLC. PPP/PRP was prepared from 45 dogs comprising 4 different plasma groups (pG1, healthy non\u2010Cavalier King Charles Spaniels [CKCS], n = 8; pG2, healthy CKCS, n = 12; pG3, MMVD CKCS, n = 14; pG4, MMVD non\u2010CKCS, n = 11). PRP [5HT] was greater than PPP [5HT] (P < 0.0001) indicating platelets as the primary source of circulating 5HT. Median PRP platelet [5HT] was significantly different between groups (P = 0.003). PRP [5HT] was greater in pG2 (1.83 femtograms/platelet[range,0.2\u20104.76];P = 0.002), pG3 (1.58,0.70\u20104.03;P = 0.005), and pG4 (1.72,0.85\u20104.44;P = 0.003) vs. pG1 (0.915,0.63\u20101.3). There was no significant difference in median PPP [5HT] between groups. At euthanasia, LV and MV tissue was obtained from 24 dogs comprising 3 different tissue groups (tG1, MMVD, n = 8; tG2, dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM]/arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [ARVC], n = 7; tG3, extra\u2010cardiac disease, n = 9). Median LV [5HT] was significantly different (P = 0.0024) between groups. LV [5HT] was higher in tG1 (11.8 ng/mg,3.96\u2010104.83) vs. tG2 (0.87,0\u201010.1;P = 0.011) and vs. tG3 (2.46,0\u20106.94;P = 0.001). MV [5HT] was significantly different between groups (P = 0.033) namely between tG1(32.4 ng/mg,8.36\u2010106.73) vs. tG3(3.59,0\u201028.26;P = 0.01). In conclusion, platelet [5HT] was elevated in healthy and MMVD CKCS compared to healthy non\u2010CKCS. LV [5HT] was elevated in MMVD compared to DCM/ARVC or non\u2010cardiac disease. MV [5HT] was elevated in MMVD compared to non\u2010cardiac disease.",

The objective of this study was to retrospectively describe the clinical and pathological features, with an emphasis on the cardiorespiratory system, in a large population with naturally occurring Toxoplasmosis. Acute Toxoplasmosis was defined as animals having positive IgM titers or a fourfold seroconvalescence of IgG titers over a 3\u20104 week period (as determined by IFA or ELISA techniques). Fourty\u2010seven dogs and 5 cats fulfilled the criteria. There was no specific breed or gender predisposition. The age range was wide (cats: 5\u201014 y median 5.5 y; dogs: 4 m\u201010 y median 4.8 y). Anorexia and lethargy were the main presenting signs in cats, were in dogs 61% were exercise intolerant, 53% experienced breathlessness, 23% coughed and 23% were syncopal. On electrocardiography AV\u2010block was present in 6 dogs (3 first, 1 second, 2 third degree), V\u2010arrhythmias in 9 dogs and supraventricular arrhythmias in 5 dogs (2 AF, 1 atrial flutter, 2 SVT). Radiographic findings ranged from pulmonary (broncho\u2010interstitial patterns (5) and alveolar \u2018aspiration\u2019 infiltrates (2)) to cardiac pathology (cardiomegaly (5) and congestive heart failure (3)) but was normal in 21/35 sets of RX available. Echocardiography was normal in 25/48 animals and showed signs that might have been consistent with myocarditis in only 9/48 animals. Two dogs had developed pericardial and one pleural effusion. A neutrophilia was the most frequent hematological abnormality (15%), followed by a mildly elevated HCT (11%). Elevated liver enzymes was the most common biochemical finding (35) followed by increased CPK in 5/52. Toxoplasmosis IgM titers at initial presentation (1/40\u20101/640 median 1/60) were elevated in all but 1 cat that seroconverted (IgG) over a 3 week period. It could take up to 16 months for complete disappearance of the IgM titers with a median of 5 months. In two dogs the titers were re\u2010activated over time. Troponin I levels were available in 25 dogs and elevated in 10 (range 0.34\u201014.5). Proteinuria at initial presentation was a feature in only 3 dogs and 1 cat. Final clinical diagnosis consisted of myocarditis in 17 animals, hepatopathy in 4, tracheobronchitis/pneumonitis/pneumonia in 7, pericarditis, chorioretinitis and PLNP in 2, laryngeal paralysis in 3 (accompanied with megaoesophagus in 2), pleuritis, polyarthritis, polymyopathy and sialodenitis respectively in 1. Nearly all animals were treated with clindamycine as first choice, S/TMP or doxycycline were the second choice. Three dogs died suddenly during their treatment and 9 were euthanized (3 cats) for complications of the disease, making this disease not as inoffensive as widely described.",

Intra\u2010operative, immediate post\u2010operative and delayed (2 days post\u2010operatively) embolization to the systemic or pulmonary circulation is a reported complication of transcatheter PDA occlusion, regardless of the device type used. Embolization is typically thought to occur as a result of inappropriate device sizing or operator error. Veterinary studies assessing device efficacy and complication rates are relatively small making it statistically unlikely to catch rare, but important complications. This report is based on the results of a survey designed to assess type, rate and details of complications, including embolization, associated with transcatheter PDA occlusion. In addition we will report details of preferred methods of PDA size estimation, ductal occluder selection and procedural practices such as the use of transesophageal echocardiography. An initial survey of 77 respondents indicated that a variety of devices including the canine ductal occluder (69/77), coils (31/77), vascular plugs (20/77) have been used for transcatheter occlusion Preliminary Survey Results: Six of 385 (1.6%) procedures resulted in embolization. Five of the six were intra\u2010operative and one was after discharge from the hospital. Two of the six were in cats, and both of these devices were vascular plugs. The remaining devices were canine ductal occluders. There were two deaths. One death was associated with attempted retrieval of a vascular plug in a cat and the other a consequence of acute heart failure following delayed embolization of a ductal occluder. All respondents reported using fluoroscopy and angiography. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography was frequently used for adjunctive imaging during procedures.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure dietary amino acids, choline, carnitine, serotonin, and ergovaline as possible factors that could play a role in the pathophysiology of DMVD. Thirteen commercially\u2010available diets were selected for analysis based on a previous study comparing dogs with and without DMVD and diet histories from clinical cases. Diets were analyzed for macronutrients; amino acids; ergovaline; the indoleamines, 5HT and melatonin; choline, and free L\u2010carnitine. There was a wide range in the concentrations of all analytes in the diets tested. No essential amino acids were below the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) minimums. Taurine, although not an essential amino acid for dogs, was below the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrient Profile for taurine in 9 of 13 diets. Tryptophan ranged from 0.19\u20100.59% dry matter (median = 0.28% dry matter). All 13 samples tested had undetectable ergovaline concentrations.

To better understand the relationship between growth, body size, and HCM, the objective of this study was to assess adult cats to determine whether echocardiographic findings of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are related to early growth patterns, body size, or metabolic markers. Adult cats from a single colony that were \u2265 3 years of age and for which growth curves were available were eligible for the study. Physical examination and echocardiography were performed, and body weight, body condition score (BCS), and head length and width were measured. Circulating glucose, insulin, N\u2010terminal pro\u2010B\u2010type natriuretic peptide (NT pro\u2010BNP), and IGF\u20101 concentrations were measured and growth data were collected. Stepwise multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Twenty\u2010eight neutered adult cats (20 males, 8 females) were eligible for the study. Median age was 5.3 yrs (range, 3.2\u20106.8 yrs). Current body condition scores ranged from 4\u20109 (median, 5.5) and body weight ranged from 2.7\u20107.2 kg (median, 4.8 kg). Cardiac abnormalities included a cardiac murmur (n = 7; 24%), gallop (n = 3; 10%), and arrhythmia (n = 1; 4%). Fourteen of 28 cats (50%) had echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Head width (P = 0.017), body weight (P < 0.001), NT pro\u2010BNP (P = 0.023), and IGF\u20101 (P = 0.013\u20100.022) were significantly associated with measures of LVH. Potential associations between body size, IGF\u20101, LVH, and HCM warrant future prospective studies.",

Median S\u2010PB concentration on day 15 at times 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours post drug administration were 7.5 ug/mL, 6.5 ug/mL, 6.5 ug/mL, 6.0 ug/mL for group 1; 26.0 ug/mL, 26.0 ug/mL, 25.5 ug/mL, and 25.5 ug/mL group 2, and 17.0 ug/mL, 15.5 ug/mL, 15.0 ug/mL, and 15.5 ug/mL in group 3. One cat was withdrawn from group 2 on day 3 due to intolerable side effects. An additional cat was added to total 6 cats completing group 2. Side effects were mild and transient in 12 of the 18 (66%) cats completing the study. Side effects included polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, sedation, ataxia and mild paraparesis, pinnae erythema and increased ear grooming. The results of this study show that therapeutic serum phenobarbital concentrations can be achieved in cats, following chronic transdermal administration of PB in PLO and PCCA Lipoderm at 9 mg/kg q 12 h, and that side effects were minor.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of LEV in epileptic dogs when administered concurrently with conventional AEDs. Eighteen client\u2010owned dogs on maintenance therapy with LEV and phenobarbital (PB group, n = 6), LEV and bromide (BR group, n = 6) or LEV, phenobarbital and bromide (PB\u2010BR group, n = 6) were enrolled. All AEDs had attained steady state concentrations. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a morning dose of LEV. Plasma LEV concentrations were determined by high\u2010pressure liquid chromatography. To account for dose differences among dogs, LEV concentrations were normalized to the mean study dose (26.4 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on adjusted concentrations using a noncompartmental method, and AUC calculated using the trapezoidal method. Compared to the PB and PB\u2010BR groups, the BR group had significantly higher Cmax (70.6 \u00b1 24.0 \u03bcg/mL, versus 35.5 \u00b1 13.7 \u03bcg/mL and 25.3 \u00b1 9.0 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) and AUC0\u2010Cn (314.2 \u00b1 114.3 h*\u03bcg/mL versus 127.0 \u00b1 64.7 h*\u03bcg/mL and 91.0 \u00b1 42.2 h*\u03bcg/mL, respectively), and significantly lower CL/F (68.9 \u00b1 22.1 mL/h/kg versus 172.1 \u00b1 81.9 mL/h/kg and 247.6 \u00b1 126.9 mL/h/kg, respectively).

Important considerations for SC preparation are to reduce contamination by fibroblasts, to obtain a large number of cells in a short period and to avoid detrimental consequences for the patient during harvesting. Here, we reported obtaining nerve biopsies from the dorsal cervical cutaneous region, from which we purified and expanded SCs. We harvested small pieces of dorsal cutaneous cervical nerves from dogs. The predegenerated tissues were cultured in conditions to enhance SC growth while reducing the number of undesired fibroblasts. Cells were immunopurified using magnetic beads and their purity was evaluated by assessing expression of cell surface antigens.",

Genotypes were analyzed for genomic inheritance patterns, with 7 chromosomes having segments consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (i.e., heterozygosity in the parents and homozygosity in both affected puppies, with the allele absent or heterozygous in the littermates). The identified regions harbored 3 candidate genes: CHRND, CHRNG and COLQ. Sequences representing the coding regions of all 3 genes from an affected puppy, the carrier sire and an unrelated Labrador Retriever, revealed a missense mutation in COLQ that alters a conserved residue. Evaluation of the mutation in extended family members identified 14 carriers, but it was not found in over 250 unrelated Labrador Retrievers. Our data suggest that a COLQ mutation is causative for CMG in Labrador Retrievers, and that proper use of a genetic test should prevent widespread transmission in this popular breed.",

In 66 cases, RT was curative, in 8 post\u2010surgical adjuvant. All the patients received a diagnostic high field MRI and a simulation CT. The expansion of GTV to PTV (Planning Treatment Volume) was 3 mm on each directions. For all of them, the feasibility of a frameless SRS or HSRT have been studied using a MonteCarlo statistic algorith and a CMS Monaco 3.0 treatment planning system (TPS) for LINAC 6 MV with beam modulator. To assess the treatment feasibility, treatment simulation have been performed \u201cin air\u201d with the Dosimetric Check software using the Iview portal ASi imager. Each animal was placed in a stereotactic cradle. Positioning verification was performed with cone beam CT. Controls were performed with serial clinical and MRI examination. All patients (37 meningiomas, 22 gliomas, 9 nerve sheath tumours, 6 pituitary tumours, 1 pineal tumour) completed the therapy. The doses delivered ranging from 16 Gy in 1 fraction to 33 Gy in 5 fractions prescribed to the 90% isodose. The RTOG toxicity show 1 G3, 3 G2, 6 G1, 64 G0.

Multivariate analysis found anatomic site, histological grade, and univariate analysis found IgG titers, prevaccination NK Assay, tumor stage influenced on survival. Paradoxically, cases with decreased IgG titers had prolonged survival compared to increasing and stable titers. Serum endogenous GD3 concentrations were determined in dogs with melanoma; melanoma cases had higher levels of serum GD3.

Among these genes, frizzled\u20106 expression was increased to the greatest extent (7.78 fold) in tumorigenic cell lines compared to non\u2010tumorigenic cell lines. Frizzled\u20106 is a co\u2010receptor for wnt ligands and has been associated inhibition of \u03b2\u2010catenin\u2010dependent signalling and more aggressive tumors.

Additionally, the tumorigenic cell lines were associated with an increase in percentage of side population cells compared to non\u2010tumorigenic cell lines (5.89% versus 1.58%, respectively). While additional studies are necessary to confirm, it is conceivable the increased expression of frizzdled\u20106 expression may be inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and thereby contributing to the formation of tumor\u2010initiating cells.

Relative super saturation (RSS) is regarded as the best method to evaluate urine. However, the test is not commercially available to the veterinary community, is labor intensive and costly. The RSS software is dated and of the 2 versions available; one, SuperSat\u00ae, is proprietary and yields results different than the other, Equil 2. Further, RSS uses a limited number of metabolites which cannot fully evaluate the complex system of urine where many promoters and inhibitors interact. As such, RSS is limited in its ability to predict the propensity of urine to form a stone. The human Bonn Risk Index uses whole urine and better reflects the risk of stone formation. The Calcium Oxalate Risk Index (CORI) is similar in principle to the human Bonn Risk Index. Briefly, whole urine is titrated with a sodium oxalate solution until precipitation occurs.

Cats were fed a series of 22 different foods with varying nutritional profiles, each for 28 days, over the course of 2 years. Foods varied in form (dry or wet) and were always fed to maintain body weight. A 24\u2010hr urine collection was performed on day 28. Equil 2 software was used to calculate RSS from urine concentrations of NH4+, Ca+2, Cl\u2010, Citrate, creatinine, Mg+2, oxalate, PO4\u20103, K+, Na+, SO4\u20102 and urine pH. SAS\u2122 version 9.2 was used for all analysis. CaOx RSS and the CORI results were moderately correlated (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001). RSS CaOx was weakly correlated to both urine pH (r = \u20100.19, p<0.05) and RSS Struvite (r=\u20100.11, p = 0.05). CORI, however, was not correlated with either urine pH (r= 0.03, p = 0.62) or RSS Struvite (r= \u20100.05, p = 0.35). Nutritional profiles of foods and individual urinary constituents were analyzed to determine drivers for RSS CaOx and CORI. The CORI test provides several advantages over RSS CaOx; It has the potential to be a commercially available test, it can provide veterinarians and pet owners with rapid feedback concerning the success of an intervention and, most importantly, through the use of whole urine, it takes into account the entire milieu of urinary constituents that affect the propensity to form a calcium oxalate stone.

Importantly, participatory surveys of equid owners, and observations by field workers identify both respiratory and neurological disease syndromes as having high impact and warranting further investigation. Strategies for equine disease surveillance where there is under\u2010reporting and lack of diagnostic infrastructure were contrasted with other species in the same regions, and systematic data gathering coupled with new indicators of disease impact will be needed for progress.

The second set of recommendations were in regards how to address disease challenges in three categories. For the first set of diseases the major technical barriers to progress are limited, and what is needed is advocacy to address behavioral and institutional barriers to progress; examples include African Horse Sickness and tetanus. For the second set of diseases significant knowledge and technical barriers remain in addition to behavioral and institutional barriers, and research is urgently needed to address these gaps; examples include epizootic lymphangitis, and blood borne parasites. The third set of diseases represent essentially syndromic diagnoses, and these require thorough investigation and renewed surveillance to determine diagnosis with a high degree of certainty. The need and opportunity to reduce infectious disease in working equids is enormous, and increased global and local advocacy based on equine welfare and the socio\u2010economic impacts will be essential for success.

However, the basis for this difference has not yet been established. The objective of this work was to determine whether immunocompetency or blood brain barrier permeability contributes to susceptibility of horses to EHM. We hypothesized that: 1) decreased cell\u2010mediated immunity, induced by cyclosporine administration, increases susceptibility to EHM, 2) increased permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), induced by mannitol and lipopolysaccharide administration, enhances susceptibility to EHM. Sixteen horses, mares and geldings aged 2\u20105 years, were randomized to 4 treatment groups: cyclosporine only, BBB disruption, cyclosporine plus BBB disruption, and untreated controls. Horses were inoculated intranasally with equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV\u20101), and horses were assessed until 15 days post\u2010inoculation (DPI). Significant findings were: 1) body temperature and nasal shedding of EHV\u20101 did not differ between groups (P > 0.05), 2) viremia was higher at 5 DPI in the cyclosporine treated horses as compared with control horses (P < 0.05), 3) viral load in neurological tissues was higher in the horses in which only cyclosporine was administered (P < 0.05), 4) maximum ataxia and clinical scores were higher in the horses in which only cyclosporine was administered, but not significantly so (P = 0.18, 0.11, respectively). This study suggested that immunocompetency was more important to the pathogenesis of EHM in young horses than was BBB integrity. Further studies are warranted to determine which aspects of the immune response affected by cyclosporine administration are necessary for development of EHM.",

Further, 4 horses develop acute onset of encephalopathy. Clinical signs generally resolved within 1\u20104 days with supportive care. Nine horses from six different outbreaks were euthanized or died due to rapid progression of clinical signs. The cause of death in these horses was attributed to endotoxemic shock, septicemia or metabolic derangements. Blood work was available from 22 horses and common hematological abnormalities were neutropenia and/or lymphopenia. Feces were available for ECoV testing by PCR from 61 and 173 sick and healthy horses, respectively. The overall agreement between clinical status and PCR detection of ECoV was 90%. In conclusion, ECoV infection in adult horses is generally associated with self\u2010limiting clinical and hematological abnormalities, although compromised intestinal barrier can lead to severe secondary complications and death.

            "text": "Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are components of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS), a condition associated with predisposition for laminitis development. Incretins play a key role in glucose homeostasis and the insulin secretory response. The incretin hormone glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 (GLP\u20101) produced by endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract promotes the release of insulin in response to oral sugar administration. GLP\u20101 has a short half\u2010life due to rapid inactivation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 (DPP\u20104). Our objective was to investigate variability in the equine incretin response and identify factors associated with incretin response variation. Glucose (GLU), insulin (INS), total GLP\u20101 (GLP1tot), and active GLP\u20101 (GLP1a) concentrations were determined in 56 Morgan horses and 56 Welsh Ponies from 7 farms at baseline and 15, 30, 60, 75, 90, and 120 minutes following an oral sugar challenge. Baseline DPP\u20104 activity, prior laminitis status, obesity status (body condition score BCS \u22657), age, breed, sex, and diet measurements were also collected. For repeated measures, a quadratic random regression analysis was performed with respect to time. Independent variables included time, age, breed, sex, obesity/laminitis status, baseline DPP\u20104 activity, and diet variables. Farm was also included as a random effect. Significant \u201crise\u2010fall\u201d curves were detected for the population's mean GLU, INS, GLP1a, and GLP1tot with peak estimates occurring at 90, 75, 60, and 60 minutes, respectively. Significant positive correlations were detected for INS/GLU, GLP1a/GLP1tot, INS/GLP1a, and INS/GLP1tot. Baseline GLU correlated positively with obesity status. Horses with a higher daily caloric intake had a lower GLU rate of change over time. Baseline INS was positively correlated with age, DPP\u20104 activity, obesity and prior laminitis status and was significantly lower in geldings. Baseline GLP1tot was negatively correlated with total daily caloric intake, but was associated with a significantly higher GLP1tot response over time. In contrast, starch was positively correlated with GLP1tot at baseline, but resulted in a significantly lower rate of change in GLP1tot over time. Baseline GLP1tot was significantly higher in stallions than geldings. However, the GLP1a and GLP1tot had a significantly lower rate of change over time in stallions. Baseline measurements of DPP\u20104 activity were significantly greater in Welsh ponies and negatively correlated with age. Findings indicate horses exhibit changes in blood GLP\u20101, insulin, and glucose concentrations following an oral sugar challenge characteristic of an incretin response. Significant factors associated with variation in this response include DPP\u20104 activity, obesity status, gender and dietary factors.",

Estrous behavior was assessed using radio frequency technology. Estrus synchronization was performed, with initiation occurring at revaccination (Groups A and C) or 21 days after revaccination (Groups B and D). After synchronization, heifers were submitted to a bull breeding pasture for 45 days. At the end of breeding period, heifers were ultrasounded to assess pregnancy. Progesterone concentrations were evaluated at unsynchronized and synchronized estrus and 10 days later, at initial pregnancy check, and at study end. Vaccination with Express FP 5\u2010VL5 did not result in significant negative reproductive impact based upon duration of interestral intervals, proportion of heifers exhibiting estrus within 5 days after synchronization, serum progesterone concentrations, pregnancy rates, and pregnancies in first five days of breeding season.

Polymicrobial infection by viral and bacterial pathogens is common in BRD, leading to more severe disease than induced by single agent infection. These agents first encounter the host at the airway epithelial cell. In other species airway epithelial cells influence host immunity through release of cytokines and immune cell activation, but the role of bovine bronchial epithelial cell (BBEC) responses in BRD, and the influence of polymicrobial infection on BBEC, are poorly characterized. The objective of this study was to determine whether expression of cytokines and surface activation markers was altered in BBEC co\u2010infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and Mycoplasma bovis (Mb), as compared to responses of BBEC infected with either agent alone. BBEC isolated from cattle by bronchial brushing were grown and differentiated in air\u2010liquid interface culture. Cells were exposed to media (mock infection), 106 pfu BRSV, 108 cfu Mb, or both agents together, for 2, 4, or 24 hours. Infection was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Transepithelial resistance (TER) was measured before and after infection, and expression of mRNA for the cytokines interleukin 8 (IL\u20108) and RANTES and the adhesion molecule ICAM\u20101 was quantified by real time RT\u2010PCR. Transepithelial resistance was decreased in all cultures at 2 hours; TER increased toward baseline in mock and BRSV cultures but not in Mb or Mb + BRSV cultures. Expression of RANTES and ICAM\u20101 was increased sharply at 2 hours after BRSV infection; this was suppressed by Mb. Expression of IL\u20108 was increased by BRSV and Mb, but was increased more by coinfection. Disease in cattle infected with BRSV + Mb may be exacerbated by impaired migration of leukocytes or excessive neutrophil influx due to alterations in expression of RANTES, ICAM\u20101, and IL\u20108.",

Further study is warranted to investigate the modes by which bacteria colonize the bloodstream in this population of animals and the significance of bacteremia on health and productivity of affected animals.",

Calves were grouped by (1) primary disease, (2) primary treatment failure and (3) multiple treatment failure. All calves were transported to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at Oregon State University for radiographs of the thorax and skull (focusing on tympanic bullae, 35\u00b0 oblique from midline) and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT). Following imaging, calves were euthanized and submitted for diagnostic pathology. For all calves, radiographs were compared to CT images to assess lesions of the tympanic bullae using gross pathology as the gold standard. Fluid in the bullae and osteolysis were measured using a scoring system and bullae wall thickness was directly measured for comparison.",
