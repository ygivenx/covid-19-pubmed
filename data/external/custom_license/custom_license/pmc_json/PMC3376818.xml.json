For each outbreak, we defined the initial source or sources of the first public communication as the individual, organization, or website that first publicly communicated information regarding the disease threat (locally or internationally, orally or in writing). The corresponding date of communication was identified by using outbreak reports disseminated by ProMED-mail (10). All outbreaks were categorized as having been first communicated by >1 nongovernmental or governmental source, or simultaneously by both types of sources. When an outbreak was simultaneously first communicated by nongovernmental and governmental sources (n = 5), the outbreak was repeated in the dataset and each source was given credit. This adjustment increased the number of outbreak events to 403.",

Median reporting times were calculated for the entire study period (1996\u20132009), before and after public recognition of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (March 12, 2003), and for each WHO-defined geographic region. The effect of the initial reporting source on the timeliness of outbreak communication was quantified by using negative binomial regression after adjusting for geographic region and whether the outbreak occurred before or after SARS. These variables were included in the model on the basis of a priori assumptions that public health infrastructure can vary by geographic and political region and that new pandemic preparedness strategies, including use of informal information to initiate public health responses, were developed in response to the SARS epidemic (11). Interaction terms between each variable were examined but were not included in the final model because none reached statistical significance (p>0.05). Temporal trends were assessed by using univariate negative binomial regression models, stratified by source category. These models included 1 covariate for the year of outbreak start.",

We encountered difficulty in selecting and consistently applying criteria to determine the initial source of public communication from ProMED-mail reports, which could have resulted in misclassification bias. Although other reporting systems that use informal information exist, they either lack a publicly available archive (for example, Global Public Health Intelligence Network) (14) or their database did not cover the entire study period (for example, HealthMap) (15). According to Heymann, et al., 65% of outbreaks recognized by WHO are first identified by informal sources (4), a proportion we did not find. Some outbreak reports were excluded because of missing data. We were able to internally validate the data that remained, but these exclusions limited the study\u2019s statistical power. Finally, use of outbreak reports collected from the WHO Disease Outbreak News might limit the generalizability of our findings to all infectious disease outbreaks. Despite these limitations, our data highlight the value of nongovernmental sources as an integral resource for providing timely information about global infectious disease threats, and demonstrate the significant improvements in the timeliness of outbreak reporting made by governmental sources.",
