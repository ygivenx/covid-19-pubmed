Ampligen\u00ae-treated patients with baseline CD4+ counts \u2265300 cells/\u00b5L showed a mean increase in CD4+ count of 26 cells/\u00b5L, which peaked at week 24. Placebo recipients had a consistent decrease from baseline. A change to Ampligen\u00ae therapy after 48 weeks of placebo treatment reversed the CD4+ decline in seven patients. Ampligen\u00ae recipients were more likely to exhibit a delayed-type hypersensitivity response and less likely to progress to AIDS than placebo recipients.[12]",

In this phase IIb study, the primary endpoint was the mean total time of HAART-free intervals before rebound of plasma HIV-1 RNA. There were two groups of patients: the \u2018Harvard cohort\u2019 of eight newly/acutely HIV-infected patients and the \u2018study group\u2019, designed to be similar to the referenced Harvard cohort. The similarities being (a) HAART was given for \u22659 months; (b) CD4 \u2265400 cells/mL; and (c) HIV RNA levels below 50 copies/mL. The main difference between the groups was that the Harvard cohort were studied within weeks or months of initial infection whereas the study group had been infected with HIV for several years. Interim data analysis were performed with a control (non-Ampligen\u00ae treated) group obtained from scientific literature meta-analysis and a second with a concurrent control (non-Ampligen\u00ae-treated) group obtained from identical, participating medical institutions. In the meta-analysis, none of the patients relapsed while on Ampligen\u00ae within the first 30 days compared with 86% of a control group of patients (p = 0.012). In the second analysis, the median duration of STI in the Ampligen\u00ae group was >18 weeks, compared with 7 weeks in the concurrent control, non-Ampligen\u00ae group.[29]",
