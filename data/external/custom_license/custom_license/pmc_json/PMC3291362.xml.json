Of these, 3,686 (98%) were located in Canada or the United States. In Germany, 6 laboratories received at least 1 set of 3 samples, 2 for virus antigen detection and 1 for virus culture; all contained live virus and were formatted identically. No information on infectivity or virulence of the samples was available. Because of the absence of human-to-human influenza A H2N2 virus transmission since 1968, this situation provided the rare opportunity to investigate whether infections with this strain had occurred in any of the laboratories.",

This elicited information regarding routine laboratory activities, contact with CAP samples, tasks performed in conjunction with handling of the samples, and any influenzalike symptoms (sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, and muscle pain) within the respective time frame. Persons who had worked in a receiving laboratory from September 1, 2004, to April 15, 2005, and had performed routine procedures in virology (defined as transport of samples, preparation of samples for diagnostic testing, antigen testing, nucleic acid amplification testing, and virus isolation) were eligible for the study. From May 4 to May 19, 2005, we visited the laboratories to interview supervisory personnel regarding routine work-up of samples and to collect blood from study participants for serologic testing.",

However, this comparison might not show a difference if (silent) virus transmission had occurred among laboratory staff.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are infectious agents whose transmission characteristics are similar to those of influenza. For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, laboratory-acquired infections are well documented (3,4). For M. tuberculosis, there are strong indications that they occur (5\u20137). From a public health perspective and in view of the current importance given to influenza and a possible pandemic, accurate characterization of the risk for influenza infections in laboratory settings is needed. The small number of persons included in this study limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Potentially exposed workers were presumably tested in other laboratories involved, but we are not aware of any publications to this end. The lack of evidence for laboratory-acquired infection with A H2N2 in our study suggests that the risk was low under controlled laboratory conditions. However, only a large-scale serologic study (which might still feasibly be undertaken) could further substantiate this finding.",
