            "text": "To discover new treatments for cryptosporidiosis we assembled a set of 6220 compounds with known activity against various protozoan parasites and screened against C. parvum in a high content imaging infection assay in HCT-8 cells (see supplementary materials). Notably, many anti-malarials (spiroindolones9, cyclomarins10 and imidazolopiperazines11) lacked activity against Cryptosporidium, however 154 compounds showed >60% growth inhibition at 5 \u03bcM. Secondary screening using a novel cytopathic effect (CPE) based C. parvum assay confirmed several scaffolds, with imidazopyrazines12,13 and pyrazolopyridines14 showing sub-micromolar cellular activity (Fig. 1a-d and Table 1, structures provided in Extended Data Fig.1). We evaluated \u02dc200 pyrazolopyridine analogs and found correlation between activity against C. parvum and Plasmodium falciparum (R2=0.702, Fig. 1d) suggesting that the mechanism of action of pyrazolopyridines is conserved between these two parasites. No such correlation was observed with toxicity against HepG2 (R2=0.071) (Extended Data Fig. 2). C. hominis is responsible for the majority of clinical infections15. We thus evaluated a subset of pyrazolopyridine analogs against C. hominis, and found potency comparable to C. parvum (R2 =0.872, Fig. 1e and Table 1).",

The genomes of both C. parvum and C. hominis encode multiple putative lipid kinases and the PI(4)K catalytic domain of cgd8_4500 and its C. hominis homolog Chro.80518 show 71.8% amino acid sequence similarity to P. falciparum PI(4)K. We expressed cgd8_4500 in insect cells and purified the protein (CpPI(4)K) which displays phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity with a Km for ATP and PI of 3 and 0.4 \u03bcM, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3). Using this assay, we showed that the imidazopyrazine KDU691 and the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 are potent inhibitors of CpPI(4)K enzymatic activity with IC50 values of 17 and 25 nM, respectively (Fig. 1f). Both compounds have a >50 fold selectivity window against the human PI(4)K III\u03b2 homologue (Extended Data Table 1).",

Further genetic and structural insights are needed to unambiguously establish PI4(K) as the target. However, we note that the Plasmodium PI(4)K inhibitors diaryl-aminopyridine (MMV390048)17 and quinoxaline (BQR695)12 which are inactive against C. parvum and C. hominis do not inhibit CpPI(4)K enzymatic activity (Fig. 1f). Finally, mechanistic studies revealed an increased Km for ATP in the presence of KDU731 (Fig. 1h), suggesting ATP-competitive inhibition similarly to what was previously observed for the Plasmodium enzyme12. Additional structure-activity relationship analysis of pyrazolopyridines against Cryptosporidium is found in the supplementary information. Taken together our data suggest that pyrazolopyridines are inhibitors of CpPI(4)K that bind to the ATP-binding site of the enzyme with a favorable selectivity window over human PI(4)K.",

A very safe drug profile is thus a key component of the target product profile18,19. KDU731 has a selectivity index of more than 100 (CC50 HepG2 = 15.6 \u03bcM and CpCPE EC50= 0.1 \u03bcM) (Extended Data Table 1). In a battery of safety pharmacology assays, the compound does not show intrinsic risks for cardiotoxicity, mutagenicity, clastogenicity, or phototoxicity and it does not significantly bind to a panel of human anti-targets (Extended Data Table 1 and 2). KDU731 safety was further evaluated in a 2-week toxicology study in rats using a solid dispersion formulation to maximize systemic exposure (\u02dc25 fold). In this study, no significant histopathological changes and only minor changes in clinical chemistry and hematology were observed (slight elevation of chloride and phosphate ions and increase in red blood cells, see supplementary materials). Importantly, no hematopoietic toxicity related to potential inhibition of PI3K or PI4K lipid kinases was observed, suggesting that the in vitro selectivity of KDU731 translated to lack of host toxicity in vivo (Extended Data Table 1). Children with cryptosporidiosis in resource limited settings frequently suffer co-morbidities including HIV, TB, and other infections, anti-cryptosporidial drugs will thus likely be used along with other medications and the risk of drug-drug interactions needs to be minimized. Consistent with the requirement, KDU731 did not inhibit any of the major Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and did not induce human pregnane X receptor (Extended Data Table 1).",

KDU731 orally-administered in suspension formulation displayed a moderate half-life (T1/2 = 2-4 h) in all three species. KDU731 was selected as a drug candidate because it shows moderate-to-low oral bioavailability (37% in rodents, 9% in non-human primates).

We used genetically-modified parasites to build more facile models. We established the EC50 of KDU731 for transgenic parasites8 in HCT-8 using Nanoluciferase (Nluc) as a readout and found it comparable to wildtype parasites (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Next, we inoculated 6-8 week old C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3-knockout mice with 10,000 oocysts and monitored infection following parasite-derived luciferase activity in the feces (Fig. 2a). Infected mice were treated orally with KDU731 in suspension formulation and parasite load was measured in the pooled feces by Nluc and quantitative PCR assay with a high degree of correlation (Spearman coefficient=0.786; two- tailed P=0.048). The Nluc assay has a small sample requirement (20 mg) and thus could be conducted on individual mice as well as pooled feces (unpaired t-test comparing means of individual and pooled readings showed no significant difference, two-tailed P=0.3862). Importantly, KDU731 dramatically reduced oocyst shedding regardless of assay method (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4b and c, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, pooled Nluc two-tailed P <0.001; fecal qPCR two-tailed P=0.0042). In a modified design, KDU731 (10 mg/kg) treatment was initiated at the peak of infection again resulting in significant reduction of oocyst shedding (Fig. 2a and c). At the end of the treatment period three mice per group were killed and intestines were processed for histology. We did not observe parasites in the intestines of treated animals while those that received vehicle showed substantial infection (Fig. 2d).",

Additionally, treatment in neonatal calves, which closely matches the pathophysiological and pharmacological challenges faced in the treatment of young malnourished children, led to significant decrease in parasite shedding and rapid resolution of diarrhea and dehydration. Our lead candidate, KDU731, displays good anti-cryptosporidial activity and meets a broad range of safety and pharmacology criteria required for a much needed novel cryptosporidiosis therapeutic intervention. Further safety and pharmacological preclinical evaluation is currently ongoing to support the initiation of human clinical trials.",

The solution was spray dried using a Buchi B290 Mini spray dryer with an inlet temperature of 75\u00b0C, aspirator set to 100% and pump to 35% followed by overnight drying under vacuum at 40\u00b0C. Amorphous nature was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis and powder was stored at 4\u00b0C. SD powder suspension was prepared freshly in 0.5% HPMC in 50mM acetate buffer (pH4.7) at 10 mg/mL of KDU731 (equivalent to SD powder 50mg/mL) and rats were dosed within one hour of preparation. Blood samples for PK studies were collected between 0 and 24 h post dose. Compound plasma concentrations were determined by LC/MS. Plasma samples from pharmacokinetic studies were extracted with acetonitrile: methanol: acetic acid (90:9.8:0.2) containing warfarin as an internal standard, using an 8.8:1 extractant to plasma ratio. Analyte quantitation was performed by LC/MS/MS. Liquid chromatography was performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system, with the Agilent Zorbax Phenyl (3.5\u03bc, 4.6 x75 mm) column at an oven temperature of 45\u00baC, coupled with a API4000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). PK parameters were determined using Watson LIMS, by non-compartmental analysis.",

Assuming a type I error risk of 5% and a type II error risk of 80%, 7 calves were needed in the treatment group, plus 2 positive controls. In the event of calf death or removal from the study, an additional 4 calves were added to the control group (n = 6). Sample size was calculated using Epi Info. Fifteen Friesian-Holstein bull calves were enrolled in November 2015 and February 2016.

Fecal luciferase measurements of individual mice with treatment initiated after 3 (b) or 11 (c) days of infection (red, vehicle control shown in black), n=5 and n=9 mice respectively, representative of two biological replicates for b and c. d, Histology of the ileum of infected mice (shown in c) after one week of KDU731 treatment compared to vehicle treated control on day 18 (n=3 biological replicates, representative images shown here). Note numerous intracellular parasite stages (white arrowheads) and extracellular oocysts (black arrowhead) in the control absent in the treated mice. Vehicle treated animals showed disorganized columnar epithelial cells and loss of brush border when compared to KDU731 treated mice. White box indicates section shown at higher magnification to the right. Mice (n=5) infected with UGA2 FLuc were treated on day 7 with 10mg/kg of KDU731 (red (e) and g), 100 mg/kg nitazoxanide (red (f), also see Extended Data Fig. 5), or vehicle (black, e and f) for one week. Animals were monitored by whole-animal-imaging and a radiance scale and quantification of total flux in photon/sec is shown. *Animals shown on the baseline were below the level of detection.",
