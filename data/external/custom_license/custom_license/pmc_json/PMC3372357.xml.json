Wire cages are stacked next to each other with \u22485\u201310 birds in each cage (chickens, geese, ducks, and pigeons). Each species of bird is placed in separate cages; chickens are the most common species. All cages are located in a closed room separated by a glass window from customers, who choose the bird they prefer. When a live bird is selected, it is slaughtered in view of the customer. Sanitation inspections are routinely performed by municipal authorities. No diseased or dead birds were observed during this investigation.",

Positive PCR results were confirmed by sequencing. None of 94 anal swabs from live birds tested positive for HPAI H5N1. However, 1 of 79 animal cage swabs tested positive for HPAI H5N1 (Figure 1). The positive swab was from a goose cage at market I (Table), the market that the patient visited from February 10 to February 20. The nucleotide sequences of H and M genes from specimens from this patient were compared with those from the animal cage swab and submitted to GenBank (accession nos. DQ842487\u201390). Forty-eight variations were found in the NA gene and 15 were found in the HA gene, which resulted in 17 HA amino acid and 3 NA amino acid changes, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis with the neighbor-joining method using the ClustalX program (4) suggested that the 2 strains are related to each other and to duck isolates (Figure 2).",

This was previously shown in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2001, where H5N1 virus was detected in domestic birds in a live bird market (9). Serologic investigation also demonstrated low seroprevalence of antibody against HPAI H5N1 in poultry workers from this market. However, no outbreaks of HPAI among birds were reported until early 2004 (10). H5N1 virus may be sustained in poultry largely through the movement of poultry and poultry products, especially through domestic ducks (11,12). The introduction of H5N1 virus from healthy poultry (such as ducks) may be occurring where no outbreaks in healthy flocks have been observed. Therefore, the virus is likely reintroduced at low levels and can infect persons visiting live poultry markets.",
