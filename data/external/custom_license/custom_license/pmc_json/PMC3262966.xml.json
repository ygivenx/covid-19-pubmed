Recent outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1) have had a huge economic effect in the poultry breeding sector [2, 3] but besides the economic effect, human health is at stake because avian influenza can also infect mammals including humans [4, 5]. The increasing incidence of resistance to antiviral drugs is a major concern to public health. Because strains tend to become more aggressive, adequate therapeutic strategies are needed [6].",

However, concerns arose about the increasing incidence of resistance to antiviral drugs [7\u201312]. Several causes have been suggested including the inappropriate use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of humans during the outbreaks of avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [13, 14]. Furthermore, it has been shown that oseltamivir carboxylate (Fig. 1) is not removed or degraded in normal sewage water treatment and thus enters the environment [15]. Waterfowl are then in a position to ingest the active oseltamivir carboxylate. This could drive the selection of resistant avian influenza A strains in the gut. Especially in countries (e.g. Southeast Asia) where waterfowl and humans come in close contact, this could lead to the spread of other strains incorporating the resistance genes and change of host [16, 17]. Finally, amantadine, oseltamivir and arbidol (Fig. 1) are allegedly being administered to poultry and other livestock in China, Southeast Asia and Russia [7, 18, 19]. To prevent excessive use of antiviral drugs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited the non-consistent use of two types of antiviral drugs in chickens, turkeys and ducks: the amantadines, including amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuramidase inhibitors, including zanamivir and oseltamivir (Fig. 1) [20].",

Single-residue methods for the quantitative analysis of antiviral drugs in biological matrices using mass spectrometry have been published for zanamivir [21, 22], ribavirin [23\u201326], oseltamivir [17, 27\u201330] (some of them including oseltamivir carboxylate [27, 30]), oseltamivir carboxylate only [31], amandatine [32\u201334], some of them including rimantadine [33, 35, 36], and arbidol [37, 38]. Recently, Chan et al. [39] reported a multi-compound method for the analysis of antiviral drugs in poultry muscle using zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (zic-HILIC) in combination with mass spectrometric detection. However, this method is suitable for screening purposes only and it is limited to the analysis of basic and amphoteric antiviral drugs.",

The antiviral drugs include the extremely polar zanamivir and ribavirin, whereas arbidol is reasonably non-polar. Furthermore, the selection includes basic, amphoteric and neutral drugs.",

However, using zic-HILIC no retention was obtained for arbidol, the most non-polar compound we studied and which was not included in the screening method reported by Chan et al. [39]. Only slight improvement in the retention time (RT) was made by protonating arbidol (pKa 6) using a mobile phase of pH \u2264 4 and lowering the ammonium formate concentration to 5 mM. Nevertheless, insufficient retention was obtained for arbidol and severe matrix effects, even for late-eluting polar compounds like zanamivir and ribavirin, were observed (Fig. 3).",

The matrix effects of zanamivir and ribavirin were evaluated after injection of a cleaned extract on the Hypercarb column and were both found to be 39%. It is observed that the matrix effects for zanamivir using injection on solely the Hypercarb column are increased compared to the column-switch set-up.

For arbidol, inadequate linearity, trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility are observed. On two validation days, the calibration lines are adequate, but on 1 day the linearity is insufficient due to two deviating calibration points. The poor trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility of arbidol are caused by 10 out of 63 spiked samples showing a quantitative result that is 1.5\u20133.5 times higher than expected. This is likely to be caused by a difference in matrix interference, which plays a major role for arbidol (Fig. 5a).

The results were 4.9 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for the poultry muscle and 15.3 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for the turkey muscle sample. These levels are in good agreement with the indicated amantadine concentration, being approximately 4 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for the poultry muscle and 8\u201325 \u03bcg kg\u22121 for the turkey muscle. From this it is concluded that the developed method is applicable to real muscle samples.",

            "text": "A method using a tandem SPE sample preparation clean-up combined with column-switch LC\u2013MS/MS was developed for the analysis of seven antiviral drugs in poultry muscle, ranging from very polar to reasonably non-polar drugs, and including basic, amphoteric and neutral compounds. The removal of matrix interferences was critical for the detection and quantification of zanamivir and ribavirin in particular. Because neither compound was sufficiently retained by using reversed-phase chromatography, a column-switch LC system combining a reversed-phase and a Hypercarb column was developed. This system showed improved separation power and is relatively easy to set-up, which is of major importance in a routine situation. Furthermore, a tandem SPE procedure proved to be mandatory for additional removal of matrix constituents. The method was fully validated according to 2002/657/EC [1] at concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 \u03bcg kg\u22121. Good linearity, trueness, repeatability and within-lab reproducibility were obtained for zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine. For arbidol these paramaters did not comply with the established criteria because the method resulted in a severe overestimation of the concentration for 16% of the spiked samples. The selectivity and robustness proved to be sufficient to apply the presented method in a routine situation enabling parallel analysis of at least 48 samples within 1 day. It is concluded that the presented method is suitable for the quantitative confirmatory analysis of zanamivir and ribavirin at levels as low as 10 \u03bcg kg\u22121 and for oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg kg\u22121. Furthermore, the presented method is suitable for the qualitative confirmatory analysis of arbidol at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg kg\u22121.",
