            "text": "Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide [1], and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is closely associated with cervical cancer [2\u20134]. More than 100 HPV genotypes have been identified [5], but the HPV type 16 (HPV16) has been associated with more than 50% of the HPV-related cervical cancer cases studied [6\u20138]. The E6 protein physically interacts with p53, leading to its dysfunction, while the E7 protein binds to the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and activates cell cycle-associated genes [9\u201311]. Because the E6 and E7 proteins are consistently expressed in cervical cancer cells [12], these two oncoproteins represent attractive targets for developing vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies against HPV-associated diseases. Recently, Nakagawa et al. [13\u201315] demonstrated the presence of E6-specific memory T cells in women whose HPV infection had been cleared and concluded that the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to HPV16 E6 antigens was more important than that to E7 antigens for controlling HPV16 infection. Thus, E6-specific CTL activity may be a major immune response for controlling persistent HPV16 infection.",

            "text": "Because HPV infects the epithelium of the lower female genital tract, where it can lead to cervical carcinoma [16], one strategy against cervical cancer might be to induce effective mucosal immunity with an aim toward inhibiting genital HPV transmission/infection and eradicating HPV-infected cells. Several studies have demonstrated that oral immunization with viral antigens can induce antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity [17\u201321]. Oral administration is not only the way to increase mucosal immunity, but it is generally more convenient than parenteral administration. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are relatively safe and exhibit an adjuvant effect in modulating the immune responses, may be a good delivery vehicle for mucosal immunization [22\u201324]. In addition, surface-displayed antigens on lactobacilli were reportedly efficient for inducing antigen presentation in dendritic cells [23], and surface localization of HPV16 antigens on lactococci was reported to induce greater cellular immunity compared to the intracellular or secreted forms [25]. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that oral administration of viral antigens displayed on Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus S protein and the HPV16 E7 protein, effectively induces antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies [18] and antitumor responses in mice [19]. In this study, we used the pgsA gene product, a transmembrane protein derived from the poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid synthetase complex (the Pgs-BCA system) of Bacillus subtilis [26, 27], as a surface anchoring motif for surface display of antigens on L. casei. Here, we examined whether oral administration of E6 antigens expressed on L. casei could elicit E6-specific cellular immunity. The induction of effective immunity was assessed by production of antigen-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA, and by quantification of antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8+ cells in splenocytes or local lymphocytes by the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. Finally, we tested the in vivo tumor regression effect of HPV16 E6-expressing L. casei in a mouse tumor model seeded with the E6-expressing tumor cell line (TC-1).",

The HCE promoter of pHAT:PgsA-E7 [20] was replaced with a promoter of the fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Pald) gene originating from L. casei, and the E7 protein-encoding gene downstream of the poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid synthetase A (PgsA) gene was replaced with that encoding the E6 protein of HPV16. Briefly, the gene encoding the E6 protein of HPV16, was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from the CaSki cell line [28], using forward (5\u2032-CAG GGA TCC ATG CAC CAA AAG AGA ACT GC-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-CGC TCT AGA TCA TTA CAG CTG GGT TTC TCT ACG TG -3\u2032) primers that contained BamHI and XbaI sites, respectively. The E7 gene of pHAT:PgsA-E7 was then replaced with the HPV16 E6-encoding fragment using these restriction enzyme sites. The plasmids were first established in E. coli JM83 and then transformed into L. casei BLS by electroporation. E. coli JM83 cells were grown in Luria\u2013Bertani medium with erythromycin (150 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0C.

After transformation, L. casei cells harboring the pKV:PgsA or the pKV:PgsA-E6 were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C for induction of recombinant protein expression. To confirm proper expression of the HPV16 E6 protein, equal amounts of whole cell lysates from the recombinant L. casei harboring the pKV-PgsA or the pKV-PgsA-E6 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using both anti-HPV16 E6 and anti-PgsA antibodies (Fig. 1b). The lane containing the L. casei-PgsA-E6 (Fig. 1b, lane 2) contained a ~61 kDa immunoreactive band that most likely represents the fusion protein comprising the 17-kDa E6 protein and the 44-kDa PgsA surface display motif. A smaller band representing expression of the PgsA anchor protein was detected in L. casei-PgsA lysates (Fig. 1b, lane 1). The surface localization of the HPV16 E6 protein on L. casei was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, using a polyclonal anti-HPV16 E6 antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody. FACS analysis revealed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity of the L. casei-PgsA-E6 [mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) = 33.42] compared to that of L. casei-PgsA (MFI = 4.16) (Fig. 1c). The immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that the L. casei-PgsA-E6 was immunostained positive for HPV16 E6, while the control L. casei-PgsA was not (Fig. 1d).

Next, E6-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells were evaluated in splenocytes from the L. casei-PgsA or the L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice, using the ELSPOT assay.

By the ELISPOT assay, the number of E6-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in MLN cells was increased approximately 2.6-fold after the second boost in the L. casei-PgsA-E6-vaccinated mice compared to the control mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4a).

For mucosal vaccination purposes, lactic acid bacteria are attractive delivery vehicles because they are considered safer than many other live vaccine carriers (e.g. Salmonella, E. coli, Vaccinia) [23]. We chose L. casei because it is a good agent for oral vaccination due to its high intrinsic adjuvant effect and ability to increase innate immunity [36, 37]. The L. casei strain we used as the vaccine vehicle in this study can activate immature human bone marrow dendritic cells through upregulation of IL-12 secretion and surface expression of costimulatory molecules (CD40) (unpublished data).",

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of targeting the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein for vaccine development to control HPV-associated lesions. We showed that oral treatment of mice with HPV16 E6 proteins displayed on L. casei could induce E6-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA production, and E6-specific T cell responses in both the systemic and mucosal immune systems. There was a significant increase of E6-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in vaginal lymphocytes from L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice only after the second boost. The mucosal immune system has both inductive and effector sites [35]. This vaccine was orally administered, meaning that its inductive site was mainly in the intestinal regions, which is somewhat distant from the effector site (vaginal region). Therefore, it is possible that the CMI response at this distant effector site could be delayed. However, we found that the number of E6-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in the L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice was significantly higher than that in the L. casei-PgsA-immunized mice. More importantly, in an in vivo mouse tumor model, the orally administered L. casei-PgsA-E6 showed antitumor effects against HPV16 E6-expressing murine tumors, as evidenced by reduced tumor size and increased survival rate versus mice receiving control (L. casei-PgsA) immunizations. In accordance with the observation, in vivo depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells by MAb GK1.5 or MAb 2.43 completely abrogated anti-TC1 tumor activity in mice orally administration with the L. casei-PgsA-E6. These results showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were essential for antitumor immunity against E6-expressing tumor. The human clinical study using L. casei expressing HPV16 E7 on patients of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3) to check the safety and efficacy is currently in progress. The additional administration of recombinant L. casei expressing HPV16 E6 may enhance its therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, our findings suggest that recombinant L. casei expressing HPV16 E6 antigens may be a promising therapeutic vaccine candidate against cervical cancer. In addition, our surface display system could be used to design vaccines against other mucosally transmitted pathogens.",
