First, the synthesized free diffusing photo-cross-linkable\nAc-\u03b2-CDs (acryloyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin, 1.5 acryloyl groups\nper Ac-\u03b2-CD molecule on average, i.e., a fraction of Ac-\u03b2-CDs\nbear more than one acryloyl group, Figure S1) were coupled to the aromatic residues of gelatin (e.g., phenylalanine,\ntyrosine, and tryptophan) via host\u2013guest interactions. Subsequently,\nUV-initiated polymerization of the Ac-\u03b2-CDs led to the formation\nof gelatin hydrogels containing two types of cross-links: (1) the\nphysical host\u2013guest complexations between the aromatic residues\nof the gelatin and oligomerized Ac-\u03b2-CDs, which are distributed\nthroughout the entire hydrogel network; and (2) the chemical cross-links\n(due to the fraction of Ac-\u03b2-CDs bearing more than one acryloyl\ngroup) among the oligomerized Ac-\u03b2-CDs, the distribution of\nwhich is sparse and localized because of the inefficient reaction\namong the bulky Ac-\u03b2-CDs.

The Ci-I hydrogels showed an obvious frequency-dependent\nincrease in the modulus (Figure 1a), indicating the involvement of the physical host\u2013guest\ncomplexation between gelatinous aromatic groups and \u03b2-CDs in\nstabilizing the hydrogel network. The further rheological studies\nrevealed a \u201csol\u2013gel\u201d transition of the Ci-I hydrogels\nunder alternating high/low shear strain (Scheme 1). The Ci-I hydrogels switched to the \u201csol\u201d\nstate (G\u2033 > G\u2032)\nunder\na high shear strain of \u223c1000% and immediately recovered to\nthe \u201cgel\u201d state (G\u2032 > G\u2033) under a subsequent low shear strain of 1% (Figure 1b). Moreover, even\nafter repeated high/low shear loading cycles, the storage modulus\n(G\u2032) of the Ci-I hydrogels consistently recovered\nto \u223c80% (1050 Pa) of that of the freshly prepared unloaded\nsamples (1373 Pa) (Figure 1b). This slight reduction in storage modulus is likely attributed\nto the partial disruption of chemical cross-linking under loading.\nThis excellent shear-thinning and self-healing capability enables\nthe injection of Ci-I hydrogels without significantly compromising\ntheir mechanical properties. The prefabricated Ci-I hydrogel disks\ninjected through a G21 needle into cylindrical models were efficiently\nremolded to regain the original disk morphology (Figure 1c). Moreover, the compression\ntest showed that the injection did not significantly affect the mechanical\nproperties of the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels, and the injected hydrogels\ncould still sustain over 95% compressive strain without rupture as\ncould the noninjected hydrogels (Figure 1d). Furthermore, after the first loading\u2013unloading\ncycle, the Ci-I hydrogels exhibited almost coinciding loading\u2013unloading\nstress versus strain curves obtained from the remaining loading cycles\n(peak strain: 60%), suggesting excellent resistance to excessive cyclic\ncompression (Figure 1e). Previous studies65\u221268 proved that well-designed injectable hydrogels could prevent encapsulated\ncells from damage of shear force during the injection through the\nsyringe needle. To study whether our Ci-I gelatin hydrogels could\nmaintain the viability of the encapsulated cell during the injection,\nwe cultured hMSC-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels in vitro for 1 day before injecting the hydrogels through a G21 needle, and\nthe injected hydrogels were further cultured in vitro for another 5 days. Figure S3 shows that\nthe cell viability is still >90% even after injection, demonstrating\nthe effective protection of the encapsulated cells by the injectable\nCi-I gelatin hydrogels.",

To demonstrate this, we seeded MSCs on the surface\nof Ci-I hydrogels with or without the loaded icaritin.

The majority of MSCs encapsulated in the Ci-I gelatin\nhydrogels were viable and spread to adopt a stellate morphology after\n2 weeks of culture (Figure 3a), indicating that the dynamic Ci-I hydrogel network provides\na permissive 3D environment to facilitate cell\u2013matrix interactions.\nThen, we evaluated the differentiation of MSCs encapsulated in hydrogels\nunder different culture conditions. Previous studies showed that dexamethasone\n(Dex), a clinically used corticosteroid, improved the osteogenesis\nof MSCs at low concentration but promoted the adipogenesis of MSCs\nat high concentration.73,74 Our RT-PCR data indeed showed\nthat a low media concentration of Dex (100 nM, \u201c100Dex\u201d)\npromoted the expression of osteogenic markers (ALP and Runx2), whereas\na high media concentration (500 nM, \u201c500Dex\u201d) of Dex\nup-regulated the expression of adipogenic markers of the MSCs encapsulated\nin hydrogels (CEBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3) (Figure 3b). In contrast, media supplementation of\nicaritin effectively suppressed the expression of adipogenic marker\ngenes and promoted that of osteogenic marker gene, alkaline phosphatase\n(ALP), of the encapsulated MSCs under a high media concentration of\nDex (Figure 3b, \u201c500Dex+icaritin\n(M)\u201d). The upregulation of another osteogenic marker gene Runx2\nis insignificant. We speculated that it was because the Runx2 gene\nexpression data were collected at late time points, day 7 and 14,\nwhile the Runx2 is typically upregulated in MSCs at early time points\nupon osteogenic induction, and correlation between osteogenesis of\nMSCs and Runx2 expression becomes less significant at late time points.75 Furthermore, the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels that\nwere loaded with a bolus dose of icaritin (\u201c500Dex+icaritin\n(H)\u201d) without icaritin supplementation produced similar expression\nlevels of the differentiation marker genes as those of \u201c500Dex+icaritin\n(M)\u201d, which received fresh icaritin supplementation after each\nmedia change (Figure 3b). Von Kossa staining (Figure 3c) and the Runx2, OCN, CEBP\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3\nimmunohistochemical staining (Figure 3d) showed trends consistent with that of the RT-PCR.\nThese results demonstrate that the Ci-I gelatin hydrogels are likely\ncapable of mediating sustained delivery of small hydrophobic molecular\ndrugs (e.g., icaritin) to counteract the adverse effects (e.g., bone\nnecrosis) of high-concentration corticosteroids in the long term.",

The icaritin-laden hydrogels\n(\u201cicaritin+MSC+Gel\u201d and \u201cicaritin+Gel\u201d)\nalso exhibited significantly elevated expression of another proliferation\nmarker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), in addition to\nKi67 at week 6 (Figure 5a and Figure S4), regardless of MSC supplementation.\nIn addition, the \u201cicaritin+MSC+Gel\u201d group showed slightly\nreduced expression of c-Src, a detrimental factor that has been identified\nas a therapeutic target for osteonecrosis.55 CSF-1R, a tyrosine-kinase transmembrane receptor,76 was greatly reduced in the \u201cicaritin+MSC+Gel\u201d\nand \u201cicaritin+Gel\u201d groups, indicating the potential\nimmunoregulative effect of icaritin, as reported by a previous study.77 More importantly, this finding suggests that\nicaritin and MSCs delivered by Ci-I hydrogels can potentially mitigate\nthe foreign body response to biomaterial implantations, thereby facilitating\nfurther translational applications.76 By\nusing calcein green (CG) and xylenol orange (XO) to dynamically assess\nthe bone formation rate, at week 3 and 6 postsurgery we found that\ntreatment with hydrogel alone (\u201cGel\u201d) did not affect\nbone formation within the bone tunnel (Figure 5f\u2013i). Incorporation of icaritin in\nthe injected hydrogels (\u201cicaritin+Gel\u201d) significantly\nincreased the bone formation rate compared to either blank repair\nor the \u201cGel\u201d group (Figure 5f\u2013i). The encapsulation of both exogenous\nMSCs and icaritin in the hydrogels (\u201cicaritin+MSC+Gel\u201d)\nfurther enhanced bone formation in the defect site (Figure 5f\u2013i). These data demonstrate\nthat the Ci-I gelatin hydrogel is an excellent carrier of cells and\nhydrophobic drugs for promoting in situ bone regeneration\nand treating SAON.",
