But the differences are there nonetheless, and the protein-microarray field is rapidly developing its own identity, with new challenges that require a diverse set of specialized tools and tricks.",

Detection can be performed directly with a labelled sample, although this can increase the background noise. Many researchers prefer 'sandwich' formats in which a second, tagged antibody is applied that recognizes a different epitope from the capture antibody.
