Closure of live poultry markets in some affected cities dramatically reduced numbers of cases during summer of 2013 [4], but the epidemic resurged during the winter 2013\u201314, increasing reported cases to 393 in Mainland China as of 30 March 2014 [5]. The winter 2013\u201314 outbreak was mainly focused in Zhejiang Province in eastern China near Shanghai and Guangdong province in southern China adjacent to Hong Kong [6]. Guangdong\u2019s proximity sees considerable daily cross-border movement of people and poultry into Hong Kong. Ten confirmed human cases of H7N9 infection have been reported in Hong Kong since the winter 2013\u20132014 outbreak, each of which had a recent history of exposure to live poultry in Guangdong [7].",

            "text": "Although a local epidemic has yet to occur in Hong Kong, the behavioral responses among the public in the early stages of an infectious disease epidemic are important for determining the patterns of population contacts. Population behavior can significantly modify the basic reproductive number, R\n0, and thereby the daily number of newly emerging cases, influencing the epidemic\u2019s trajectory and final size [8\u201310]. A few studies have tried to measure the patterns of social contacts to provide some empirical parameters for mathematical models to assess the dynamics of transmission during epidemics [9, 10]. These studies mainly focused on patterns of daily individual contacts, and they treated behavior in the population as homogenous, without considering the potential heterogeneity in population behavior in response to infectious disease outbreaks [9, 10]. Latent class analysis (LCA), a statistical approach that captures population heterogeneity and classifies the observed population into a certain number of groups who answer a set of categorical variables in similar ways [11], has been widely used to analyze patterns of behaviors in relation to non-communicable diseases such as alcohol drinking [12, 13]. However, we are not aware of previous studies that attempted to classify population behavioral patterns in response to a new infectious disease. To address this knowledge gap, the first objective of this study was to explore population behavior patterns in response to newly emerging infection diseases, using H7N9 infection as an example. We also examined whether patterns of behavioral responses would change as the H7N9 epidemic grew in Mainland China and more imported H7N9 human cases were reported in Hong Kong.",

Population behaviors toward a threat are inherently heterogeneous because of individual variation in perceived personal risk to any given threat which serves to motivate responses to the threat [14]. Prevailing cognitive behavioral models [15, 16] propose that higher perceived personal susceptibility to disease and higher perceived threat severity motivates greater adoption of protective behaviors. A recent literature review [14] showed that most empirical studies have consistently reported a positive association between perceived personal risk (including perceived personal susceptibility to and perceived severity of the disease, and worry about the infection) and adoption of both hygiene practices and avoidance behaviors during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.",

Older people are more likely to view themselves as more susceptible to a disease [17], and thereby they were more likely to adopt hygiene practices [18\u201320] and avoid public places during epidemics [21, 22]. Reports suggest that females perceive themselves to be more vulnerable to a threat and to worry more about diseases [23]. Women report better hygiene and more avoidance behaviors during epidemics [18, 19, 24]. The association between educational attainment and adoption of protective behaviors is less conclusive in the literature [14]. Better educated individuals may be more aware of the risk related to the threat but may also have more confidence to control the threat [25], and so might be expected to be more variable in their responses to a new infectious disease. Therefore, the second objective of this study involved examining how patterns of behavioral responses among the public differed by their demographics and risk perception relating to H7N9 infection.",

Over 90 % of the Hong Kong population were Chinese ethnicity and able to communicate using Cantonese or Mandarin. All three surveys recruited subjects who were of Chinese ethnicity, aged 18 years or above, and able to speak Cantonese or Mandarin. To recruit subjects, households were first selected using random-digit dialed telephone numbers. Then within each household, one eligible subject was randomly selected using Kish grid methods and invited to complete a telephone interview based on a standardized questionnaire. This has been demonstrated to be a valid method to recruit a sample representative of the population in Hong Kong in previous studies [19, 28].

Then, LCA was employed to explore latent classes regarding adoption of protective behavior among the respondents across the three surveys. To perform the LCA, all items on protective measures which had been dichotomized as described above were entered into Mplus 6.0 for data analysis. Mplus employs full information maximum likelihood (FIML) methods to handle missing data. Hence, all cases can be used for data analysis except for cases with data missing in all analyzed items [31]. To determine how many latent classes can best fit to our data, LCA was performed in an exploratory way starting with a single-class model. The model with \u201cn + 1\u201d classes was compared against model with \u201cn\u201d classes in terms of major model fit statistics including Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), sample size adjusted BIC (aBIC), and entropy value. Models with smaller values of AIC, BIC, and aBIC and greater entropy values were preferred. The simulation study suggested that BIC index was more accurate in determining the true number of classes in LCA based on large sample size (N = 1000) compared with AIC and aBIC [32]. Entropy has a value range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating better quality of classification of the model [31]. Except for the model fit statistics, the principle of parsimony and model interpretability are another two critical criteria for determining the optimal number of latent classes [33]. Parsimony means that when other conditions are equal, model selection should favor the model with fewer freely estimated parameters. That is, the model with fewer latent classes should be selected. For multigroup models, model selection should also privilege models in which all groups have the same number of latent classes if the data can be easily interpreted based on the same model [33]. Using the above criteria, the optimal number of latent class was determined for each sample. LCA estimates both the item-response probabilities for each latent class and the class probabilities (latent class prevalence) within each sample.",

To do this, we compare the unconstrained model (M1) in which all item-response probabilities and class probabilities across the three samples were set free and a nested model (M2) in which item-response probabilities were set equal across samples but class probabilities were allowed to vary across samples. Then M1 and M2 will be compared for their likelihood ratio chi-square (G\n2) and values of AIC and BIC. An insignificant p value (p > 0.05) associated with the difference G\n2 statistics and smaller values of AIC and BIC suggest that the more restrictive model fits as well as the less restrictive model, then for the principle of parsimony, the more restrictive model will be selected [33].

It shows that the conditional item-response probabilities in each latent class only vary slightly across the three surveys, indicating that the profiles of three latent classes are comparable across the three surveys (Fig. 1). In all three surveys, Class 1 was characterized by a moderate probability of adopting basic hygiene practices including washing hands after sneezing or coughing, washing hands after returning home, and using liquid soap when washing hands. The probability of adopting other preventive measures in Class 1 was low. Therefore, we named this class \u201cModerate hygiene compliance\u201d group.

Across the three samples, we identified three comparable major patterns (classes) in preventive behavior: the moderate hygiene compliance, Good hygiene compliance, and Vigilance. This suggests that, currently within the context of repeated epidemic influenza irruptions from South China, the Hong Kong population may retain relative stable patterns of behavioral responses to a new infectious disease in the early stages, even as more confirmed cases of human infection were reported and the epidemic progressed [6]. The generally consistent item-response probabilities of a particular latent class across the three surveys further suggest structural invariance in behavior patterns [33] though it is possible that members of particular classes also change certain behaviors. For example, the Moderate hygiene compliance group reduced hand-washing after coughing or sneezing as the epidemic progressed but might have demonstrated an increase if the epidemic had significantly intensified. Moderate hygiene compliance defined the most prevalent group and its prevalence was comparable across the three surveys. Members in the Moderate hygiene compliance class may be quite resistant to changing their existing pattern of practices even if a potential epidemic is indicated but might change if significant increases in threat level are indicated. However, there were significant changes in prevalence of Class 2 (Good hygiene compliance) and Class 3 (Vigilance) in the third survey (Feb-2014 survey), suggesting that as the H7N9 epidemic became more severe in Mainland China and more imported H7N9 human cases were reported in Hong Kong; members of Class 2 may become more vigilant to the threat and thereby increase adoption of avoidance behaviors subsequently. However, this speculation awaits confirmation in future cohort surveys.",

Since it is unlikely that people will reduce their prevention practices in response to a growing epidemic threat, this pattern of practices is very likely to be habitual or even increased over the usual level seen in the absence of any epidemic activity. This class may contribute to transmitting infections such as seasonal influenza in their daily life or they might be late-stage responders who intensify protective behaviors only when risk is perceived to be imminent. Compared with the characteristics of the other two classes, respondents in this class were more likely to be male, younger, and less educated. This is consistent with previous studies conducted during SARS and the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong [18, 19, 28], suggesting that these subpopulations should be considered for targeted public health interventions to control future outbreaks of infectious diseases.",

For example, people who are generally more anxious would be expected to show high vigilance for potential threat information [34, 35]. Variation in these personality characteristics generates variable attentional bias in information processing and, coupled with cognitive style manifests as enhanced, or blunted vigilance toward threat-related information [38, 39]. This might help to explain the spectrum of active and passive behaviors seen when different individuals face a common threat signal. However, we did not measure neuroticism or trait anxiety among the respondents and thereby cannot conclude whether the heterogeneity in behavioral responses to this new infectious diseases was due to variation in these personality characteristics or not. However, the significant difference in perceived threat of H7N9 among the three classes suggests that variation in perceived vulnerability at least partially explained the behavioral heterogeneity across classes. Such variability has long been described with younger males particularly poor at risk estimates and overconfident in their abilities to control risk impacts [23, 40], so this may reflect a developmental state.",

First, although the three independent cross-sectional surveys enable observing the change in profiles and prevalence of each behavior pattern, the actual growth and decay of preventive behaviors in these three classes within the evolution of an epidemic remain unknown. Longitudinal studies should be conducted throughout future epidemics to more precisely investigate these research questions. Second, sampling errors may be a reason for the variation in prevalence of behavior patterns across surveys. However, the three cross-sectional surveys were conducted using the same sampling methods, and the demographics of the three samples were generally comparable. We had further adjusted the difference in the prevalence of behavioral patterns by sampling age, gender, and education to minimize the influence of sampling errors on behavioral variation across samples. Third, our measure of perceived personal susceptibility to H7N9 was not conditional on \u201cnot taking any prevention.\u201d This may lead to underestimation of the true association between perceived personal susceptibility and adoption of prevention if some respondents estimated their personal susceptibility to be low because they had taken the preventive behaviors [41]. Furthermore, although LCA provides significant insights in guiding public health practices, how to determine the optimal number of classes using LCA can be as much an art as a science [31]. Here, we determined the final number of latent classes based on BIC, entropy value, the principle of parsimony, and the model interpretation, factors which have been suggested to be more important over other model fit indices in simulation studies [31\u201333]. Finally, since all behaviors were measured relying on self-reported data, the results may be subject to social desirability bias. As a result, the actual size of the second and the third classes may be overestimated.",

It appears that as epidemic threat increases, more people in Good hygiene compliance may transfer to the Vigilance group while that of Moderate hygiene compliance may remain unchanged. However, it remains unknown how the trajectories of change in these behavioral practices will unfold as the threat level evolves throughout an epidemic.
