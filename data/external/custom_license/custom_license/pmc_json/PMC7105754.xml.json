            "text": "Inactivated, or WKV, vaccines are attractive because they are easily prepared (at least conceptually) and present an antigenic moiety similar to what the immune system will encounter in invading virus particles. In addition, these vaccines present multiple proteins on their surface for immune recognition (Figure 1). Antibodies were detected in patient sera to at least eight different proteins that may be in the viral particle membrane [35]. In addition to S, matrix (M) and envelope (E), four other ORFs (3a, 6, 7a and 7b) have been confirmed to encode additional structural proteins [36\u201340]. These data indicate that there are multiple epitopes and proteins that may be targets of protective antibodies. Mice vaccinated with inactivated SARS-CoV generated antibodies to a number of proteins including S, nucleocapsid (N), M and 3CL [41]. The main difficulties encountered with the production of inactivated vaccines are the biosafety level 3 growth of large amounts of pathogen and the difficulty ensuring that all virus has been successfully inactivated. For SARS-CoV, the large-scale production of UV-inactivated virus has been successfully described [42].",

However, demonstrations of efficacy against live SARS-CoV challenge are rare. In one study, WKV vaccine was shown to protect against pulmonary SARS-CoV replication in BALB/c mice, although characterization of the immune response was not reported [48]. Our consortium (The SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative) prepared a \u03b2-propiolactone-inactivated WKV SARS-CoV (Tor-2 strain) vaccine and compared its immunogenicity and efficacy to a combination of attenuated Ads expressing either S or N proteins for the ability to protect against live SARS-CoV challenge in a permissive mouse model [49]. Our results showed that the WKV vaccine, in the presence or absence of alum adjuvant, provided protection against live SARS-CoV challenge by the induction of high levels of neutralizing antibodies and the reduction of SARS-CoV load in the respiratory tract compared with mock-vaccinated mice [49]. CoV-like particles have also been developed by coexpression of SARS-CoV S protein with E, M and N proteins of mouse hepatitis virus, thus mimicking WKV. This preparation was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and to protect mice against SARS-CoV replication in lungs [50], but there was no direct experimental comparison made with the WKV vaccine.",

Formalin-inactivated whole-virus Urbani strain of SARS-CoV without adjuvant induced some neutralizing antibodies, and led to earlier clearance of virus after challenge, but provided only mild protection in ferrets [53]. Lung tissues were analyzed 23 days postchallenge and did not show significant changes between mock and vaccinated animals, but this time point may have been too late to reveal vaccination-induced differences in disease. The authors commented, \u201cthe vaccine was not immunologically robust\u201d. Our consortium also tested \u03b2-propiolactone-inactivated WKV and compared it with Ad-vectored S and N vaccines in ferrets [52], and found that both vaccines induced neutralizing antibody responses and reduced viral replication and shedding in the upper respiratory tract, and progression of virus to the lower respiratory tract. The vaccines also diminished hemorrhage in the thymus, and reduced the severity and extent of pneumonia and damage to lung epithelia. However, despite high neutralizing antibody titers, protection was incomplete for all vaccine preparations and administration routes tested.",

Inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine has been administered to 36 human subjects and was found to be safe, well tolerated and able to elicit SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies; however, lacking a natural challenge, there is no data on efficacy [55]. While it is widely accepted that endogenous antigen production (via recombinant or attenuated bacterial or viral delivery) yields superior T-lymphocyte responses, we found that SARS-CoV-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting T-cell responses were similar in WKV and Ad vector S/N-vaccinated mice [49], suggesting that WKV may induce a T-cell response equal to vectored vaccines. Thus, the accumulated data indicate that WKV vaccines are safe and they induce SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and can even activate T lymphocytes; however, compelling evidence of protective efficacy is scant or absent.",

Disadvantages of Ads compared with other viral delivery systems include their limited cloning capacity, the fact that human Ads have a restricted host range, often making animal testing difficult [59], and that a large percentage of the human population has pre-existing immunity against the vector due to natural infections [56]. The last difficulty may be circumvented by the use of prime\u2013boost protocols where a different vector (e.g., DNA vaccine) is used to prime the immune response followed by a boost with a recombinant Ad [56].",

We developed recombinant Ad constructs expressing genes for either SARS-CoV S or N proteins, and immunized SARS-CoV-susceptible 129S6/SvEv mice [61] with both vectors combined, either intranasally or intramuscularly. The vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibody, anti-SARS-CoV N protein IFN-\u03b3 secretion, and significantly reduced viral titers and RNA in the lungs of challenged mice [49]. Interestingly, although the intramuscular route was more effective in inducing neutralizing SARS serum antibodies, the intranasal route of administration induced IgA and was more effective in blocking SARS-CoV replication in nose and lung tissue (1000-fold in nasal secretions). This finding suggests that the intranasal administration of recombinant Ad N and S proteins may induce crucial protective mucosal immunity. In the same study, we compared adeno-vectored S and N vaccines with a preparation of inactivated SARS-CoV. The combined adeno-S and -N vaccine induced significantly lower neutralizing antibodies and similar anti-N IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells compared with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine, but the inactivated vaccine provided superior protection measured as SARS-CoV lung titers and RNA [49]. We also compared these vaccines in a ferret model in which ferrets show clinical signs, including fever and lung damage [52]. Both the whole-killed SARS-CoV vaccine and the combination of Ads encoding N and S proteins induced neutralizing antibody responses, reduced viral replication in the respiratory tract, and decreased tissue damage in the thymus and lungs [52]. The adeno-S and -N vaccine delivered intranasally elicited a poor serum-neutralizing antibody response but provided the best protection from lung replication and lung damage [52], indicating that serum-neutralizing antibodies are not a sufficient measure of protective efficacy of a vaccine. In addition, despite high neutralizing antibody titers in some vaccines, protection was incomplete for all vaccine preparations (with one homologous boost) and administration routes, suggesting that combinations of vaccines may be necessary to provide adequate protection against SARS in susceptible animals and humans.",

An MVA\u2013S recombinant vaccine was also employed in one ferret study with apparent increased liver pathology in vaccinated groups after SARS-CoV challenge [63].

Parainfluenza virus encoding the S protein was also protective from SARS-CoV challenge in hamsters, and the inclusion of M and E proteins enhanced efficacy [65]. Recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding SARS-CoV S protein vaccine induced SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses, and decreased viral titers and lung damage in mice [66]. As with the Ad studies [49,52], intranasal administration led to IgA production and improved protection from SARS-CoV challenge. Newcastle disease virus, an avian-tropic virus that exhibits limited replication in primate respiratory tissues, was also used for SARS-CoV vaccination. Monkeys vaccinated with Newcastle disease virus expressing S protein had up to 1000-fold less virus in the lung tissue after SARS-CoV challenge [67]. A replication-defective vesicular stomatitis virus recombinant expressing the SARS-CoV S protein induced neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses, and provided protection of immunized mice from SARS-CoV [68].",

In particular, exogenously produced proteins are typically presented with MHC class II and thus often do not generate robust cytotoxic T-cell responses. CoV S proteins are the favorite targets in CoV subunit vaccine development since this viral protein contains determinants known to elicit protective immune responses [73,74]. Consequently, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, shown to be responsible for receptor binding to cellular ACE2, is an attractive target for the development of both vaccine and therapeutics [75,76]. This approach is strongly supported by the finding that a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the N-terminal of S protein potently neutralizes SARS-CoV infection and inhibits syncytia formation through blocking of receptor binding [77]. Moreover, the S protein has been shown to induce serum-neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in mice and African green monkeys [62,64,78]. Since several other proteins are also expressed on the surface of the virion (Figure 1) and elicit antibodies detectable in sera of convalescent SARS patients [35], other proteins may also be useful to augment protective immunity. For example, antibodies to M proteins have also been shown to have neutralizing activity [79]. In addition, it has also been shown that SARS-CoV S protein can generate CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses [37].",

DNA vaccines, comprised of plasmid DNA encoding proteins from pathogens, have been demonstrated to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, the latter due to the mimicking of the effects of live viruses, in that antigenic proteins are endogenously produced and efficiently presented by MHC class I, thus inducing CD8+ T-cell responses [90]. Furthermore, the stability, simplicity, safety and ease of manufacture make DNA vaccines an attractive alternative to the use of live vaccines [90]. Several DNA vaccine candidates have been reported for SARS-CoV proteins, including those for S [12,78,91\u201394], M [95] and N proteins [87,88], all of which can generate antibody and cellular immune responses [94].",

Careful construction of the S plasmid (with splice sites and viral RNA export sequences) has now been shown to markedly increase efficacy of S-DNA vaccine in the mouse model [93], but these vaccines have not been tested in other animal models. A multiple-epitope DNA vaccine strategy elicited induction of antibody responses in mice to two epitopes, S (437\u2013459) and M (1\u201320), which were able to neutralize SARS-CoV infectivity in vitro[95], but protection was not assessed.",

N-DNA vaccine, in which the N protein is expressed and linked to LAMP in order to enhance MHC class II presentation, increased memory responses [97]. DNA vaccination with SARS-CoV N protein linked to calreticulin to increase MHC class I presentation not only generated potent N-specific humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses against N protein-expressing cells but also significantly reduced the titer of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein [88]. These data suggest that such a response might also successfully target SARS-CoV-infected cells. A N-DNA vaccine candidate was also investigated in HLA-transgenic mice and elicited a specific CD8+ T-cell response in this model [98].

            "text": "The most long-lasting and protective vaccines are those comprised of an attenuated pathogen or a closely related but avirulent live virus, such as the use of the naturally occurring vaccinia virus, a low-virulence member of the same genus, to vaccinate against smallpox. These vaccines are more efficacious due to their persistence in the host, possession of pathogen-encoded immune-activating moieties, and their appropriate location both in the body and in the cell, yielding endogenouS protein production and efficient MHC class I presentation, generating a robust cytotoxic T-cell response. The difficulty with attenuated vaccines is that attenuating point mutations may revert causing virulence, and deletion-attenuated mutants may recombine with naturally occurring environmental wild viruses to regain virulence, as has been seen with the attenuated oral poliovirus. Given safety concerns, it is often difficult to gain regulatory approval of attenuated vaccines without strong proof that the threat of disease is sufficient to warrant the use of such a vaccine. For SARS, this threshold has not yet been met, but some interesting attenuated mutants have been developed. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live-attenuated vaccine consisting of a recombinant SARS-CoV lacking the small E gene were studied. Deletion of E causes reduced viral morphogenesis and virus titers in vitro and in vivo, and thus attenuates the virus [102,103]. Hamsters immunized with this deletion mutant developed high levels of serum-neutralizing antibodies and were protected from clinical signs (decreased activity) and replication of homologous (SARS-CoV, Urbani) and heterologous (GD03) SARS-CoV in the upper and lower respiratory tract [104]. Thus, deletion of the structural E gene may be a first step toward development of a live-attenuated SARS-CoV vaccine. The deletion of the nsp-1 gene in the related CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been shown to create a highly efficacious attenuated vaccine, suggesting that this approach may also be attempted for the development of a SARS-attenuated vaccine [105]. Two comprehensive studies on gene deletion and attenuation effects showed that deletion of ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b or 9b (highlighted in Table 1) had little or no effect on viral replication both in vitro and in vivo[103,106]. It is not known if deletion of these genes might have an attenuating effect in higher mammals. However, given the disappointing protection afforded by most SARS-CoV vaccine strategies explored to date, it seems that further exploration of attenuated SARS-CoV vaccines is justified. In that vein, exploration has been undertaken on the effects of rearrangement of the SARS-CoV genome, which has been shown to be attenuating in MHV [107]. This system has the additional advantage of making recombination of the vaccine with wild CoVs (thus restoring virulence) less likely. Other strategies to protect from virulence-restoring recombination events include multiple attenuating gene knockouts, with or without growth of the virus in trans-complementing cells lines, and replacement of transcriptional regulatory sequences (analogous to promoters in most systems) with sequences incompatible for wild-type gene expression. These strategies have been fully and elegantly described in a recent review [108].",

Hamsters also do not exhibit clinical signs of SARS-CoV infection. Ferrets have been used widely for the study of influenza and are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, with lung pathology and virus shedding [9,120]. One ferret study indicated that upon intranasal administration of SARS-CoV Toronto 2 strain, no clinical signs were observed, although viral RNA could be detected in pharyngeal swabs [63,121].

Ferrets are also outbred, allowing the assessment of a range of individual responses that are documented in human SARS. Finally, the ferret model is a nonrodent model and is significantly less expensive and difficult to study than nonhuman primates. The main disadvantages of this model are that the ferret immune system is not well defined, there is a dearth of reagents and, as they are outbred, larger numbers are needed to assess statistical significance.",

In our ferret vaccine trials using S and N proteins, we noted a delayed histopathology in vaccinated groups, but no increase in pathology compared to unvaccinated groups [52]. The lack of vaccine enhancement of disease is further supported by a recent study in WKV-vaccinated and challenged ferrets that were followed for 3 weeks [53]; however, the exact details and combination of vaccine vector and antigen may control this phenomenon. In the other study that raised vaccine safety concerns, vaccination with the N protein expressed in Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles was reported to increase eosinophilic infiltration and damage in lungs of mice challenged with SARS-CoV [127]. This has not been reported in other studies, and in our studies with combination S and N protein expressed in Ad, no eosinophillic infiltration was noted in mice or ferrets [49,52]. While each vaccine and antigenic combination must be thoroughly evaluated for safety and efficacy, the overall picture for SARS-CoV vaccines shows no particular reason for concern with vaccine enhancement of disease. In the cases where it has been reported, it appears to be confined to a particular expression system rather than specifically related to any antigen. In the vast majority of studies, immunogenicity has been elicited without any negative impact on health after challenge with the virulent pathogen.",

In addition, antibodies to SARS S glycoprotein or whole SARS-CoV administered in several animal models have been shown to prevent or reduce SARS-CoV replication and disease [48,62,68,78,94,111,113,120,131\u2013133]. However, we have shown that, while inactivated SARS with alum vaccine induced 15-fold higher serum-neutralizing antibody titers than the other vaccines (Ad-vectored), this vaccine did not universally protect ferrets better from SARS-CoV challenge [52]. These data provide a cautionary note about SARS rodent models, and indicate that the induction of strong neutralizing antibodies does not equate with protective efficacy in a relevant animal model where clinical signs are apparent and significant lung damage is seen. The ability of an antibody to neutralize virus infection is the easiest activity to measure, but it is not the only important function of antibody in antiviral defense. An important lesson may be drawn from the field of poxvirology where one of the most protective antigens (A33R) generates protective antibodies that are not neutralizing [134\u2013136].",

A protollin-formulated SARS S protein delivered intranasally protected mice from SARS-CoV replication in the lung better than the same vaccine delivered intramuscularly, despite comparable serum levels of neutralizing anti-SARS IgG [137]. Presumably, this is due to the induction of IgA, which was detected only in the intranasally vaccinated animals. We found similar results in both mice and ferrets; the same vaccine given intranasally and intramuscularly gave stronger protection when delivered by the intranasal route, particularly in terms of viral load in the lung and shedding in nasal secretions [49,52]. Intranasal administration increases protection, despite greatly reduced serum antibody responses. These data underscore the importance of mucosal immunity.",

Rodents may not provide an adequate disease model, and other models are difficult to evaluate because animals are outbread and there are inadequate reagents for measuring T-cell responses. Further studies are needed to determine the relative contributions of humoral and cell-mediated immunity in protection from SARS disease. Interestingly, in a study comparing S-, M- and N-DNA vaccines, M generated the strongest T-cell responses [94], and recovered SARS patients have long-lasting CD4 and CD8 memory to the M antigen [138]. These data suggest that further research should be directed toward evaluating the potential efficacy of the M antigen, as well as other viral proteins.",

Immunogenicity has been widely demonstrated, but identification of correlates of protection, and generation of immune responses that protect from clinical signs and lung damage remain elusive. Results suggest that a protective SARS vaccine should be possible; however, protection in mammals that are susceptible to severe disease (e.g., ferrets and humans) may be more difficult than the mouse models suggest. To date, the data indicate that the most efficacious vaccine strategy might be a heterologous combination of intranasal and systemic vaccination, since each delivers different aspects of protection. Given the incomplete protection of current vaccines, it seems unwise to discount T-cell responses, which have not been adequately evaluated, or the protection that might be afforded by the inclusion of additional viral proteins (especially those displayed on the virion and on the surface of infected cells) in SARS-CoV vaccine development.",

            "text": "Since protection from disease has not been demonstrated for any vaccine tested in an animal model that mimics human SARS disease, further vaccine development to improve vaccine efficacy is needed. While it is clear that antibodies to S protein offer some protection against SARS, it is equally apparent that high neutralizing antibody titers are not sufficient to protect animals from serious tissue damage after SARS-CoV challenge. Thus, it will likely be necessary to generate protective T-lymphocyte responses or antibodies to other SARS proteins, or to improve protection. Data collected thus far suggest that strategies including mucosal immunizations coupled with a heterologous systemic route of vaccination may improve efficacy. Alternatively, the development of safe attenuated SARS vaccines may be able to offer both the quality and quantity of immune response required to stop serious SARS-CoV-induced tissue damage. It will be necessary to conduct more trials with direct comparison of vaccines (and combinations of prime\u2013boost) in appropriate animal models that more closely mimic human disease course. It will also be important to pursue an understanding of the role of T-cell immunity against SARS, since little is known at this time. Development of improved T-cell analysis reagents for ferrets will aid in this endeavor. The rate of SARS vaccine progress in the next 5 years likely depends on the perceived disease threat from SARS. If another epidemic or pandemic occurs, funding and research for vaccine development will be a priority. Likewise, efficacy in humans can only be demonstrated if there is another SARS outbreak among a population of vaccinated and control subjects.",
