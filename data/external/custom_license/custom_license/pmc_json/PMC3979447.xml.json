The antiviral and biologic activities of these formulations were compared by measuring: (1) the reduction of CPE by IFN\u03b2 on A549 human lung carcinoma cells following infection with VSV and (2) the levels of IFN\u03b2-induced MxA, ADAR1, and ISG56 mRNAs, which encode antiviral proteins and are commonly assayed in cell cultures exposed to Type I IFN as an in vitro measure of IFN biologic activity.[30\u201333] When equivalent unit amounts of the formulations were compared, IFN\u03b2-1a sc, IFN\u03b2-1a sc NF, and IFN\u03b2-1b sc demonstrated similar levels of antiviral activity in terms of IC50. However, when the formulations were compared on a weight basis (ng/mL), significantly more IFN\u03b2-1b sc was required to equal the antiviral activity of either formulation of IFN\u03b2-1a sc in terms of IC50. Similarly, when concentrations corresponding to 10 times the IC50 of each IFN\u03b2 formulation were compared on a weight basis, a smaller reduction in VSV yield was observed with IFN\u03b2-1b sc than with either IFN\u03b2-1a sc formulation. However, when concentrations corresponding to 100 times the IC50 of each IFN\u03b2 formulation were compared on a weight basis, VSV yield reductions were similar with each of the three IFN\u03b2 formulations, probably because at this concentration the plateau phase of the dose\u2013response curve has been reached, and so differences in antiviral activity between IFN\u03b2 formulations are no longer observed.",

In particular, IFN\u03b2-1a sc and IFN\u03b2-1a sc NF induced similar levels of ISG expression, and both induced significantly higher mRNA levels of ISGs compared with IFN\u03b2-1b sc. These findings suggest that, on a weight basis, biologic activity is equivalent for both formulations of IFN\u03b2-1a sc and greater than that of IFN\u03b2-1b sc. Thus, a greater weight of IFN\u03b2-1b sc may be needed to achieve the same biologic response as IFN\u03b2-1a sc, despite the fact that IFN\u03b2-1b sc has a molecular weight (approximately 18,500 daltons[34]) that is approximately 82% of that of IFN\u03b2-1a sc (approximately 22,500 daltons[35]). Antonetti and colleagues examined the antiviral activity of IFN\u03b2-1a for sc use and IFN\u03b2-1b for sc use using the same CPE assay system[1] and showed that IFN\u03b2-1a has an antiviral activity approximately 14 times greater than that of IFN\u03b2-1b (0.236 ng/mL versus 3.333 ng/mL, respectively).[1] Similar differences in biologic activity between IFN\u03b2-1a and IFN\u03b2-1b formulations have been reported previously.[9,10]",

A notable limitation of this study was that IFN\u03b2-1a im (Avonex) was not included for comparison with the other available IFN\u03b2 formulations. To date, there are no published studies that have compared within the same assay system the biologic activity of all three IFN\u03b2 formulations currently approved for treatment of relapsing MS. A second potential limitation of the present study is that only a single virus and cell model system (VSV/A549) was used to study the biologic activity of the IFN\u03b2 formulations. Therefore, additional studies are required that compare the biologic activity of all approved IFN\u03b2 formulations; such studies should employ not only the VSV/A549 model system, but also other assay systems with different IFN-sensitive viruses, as well as types of IFN-sensitive cells.",
