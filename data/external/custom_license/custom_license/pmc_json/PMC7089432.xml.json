It is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows, and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs (Pejsak and Markowska-Daniel 1997). The PRRS virus (PRRSV), the causative agent, is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae (Meulenberg 2000). This family also includes murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Meulenberg 2000). Currently, PRRSV isolates can be divided into two distinct groups, which are represented by Lelystad virus in Europe and VR-2332 in the United States, respectively (Wensvoort et al. 1991; Benfield et al. 1992). The viral genome contains nine open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b and ORFs3-7 (Wu et al. 2001).",

Approximately 50-fold decrease of virus yield in PRRSV-infected cells was observed in the presence of 400 \u03bcM NAP, as shown in Fig. 1a. At the early stage of experiments, NAP could completely inhibit the detectable propagation of PRRSV. The inhibitory effect on viral release was observed in a concentration-dependent manner of NAP. However, it lost at higher infectious doses (MOI = 0.1 and 0.5) (Fig. 2). In order to investigate inhibitory kinetics of NAP on PRRSV and inhibition mechanisms, the optimal condition was also investigated in following tests. The analysis of NAP inhibitor to PRRSV was conducted using 400 \u03bcM NAP at a low infectious dose (MOI = 0.05). The inhibitory kinetics of NAP to PRRSV was stable and easily observed which provided sufficient conditions for analyzing inhibitory mechanisms. Meanwhile, to better understand the inhibition mechanism of NAP, the inhibition of DPA, an analog of NAP without N-acetylation, was also investigated.",

However, previous experimental evidences indicated that NO activity varied among different cells or tissues and NO formation could not be detected in porcine immune cells. In addition, NO level was not changed in lung macrophages of the PRRSV-infected pigs (Boissel et al. 1998). Recently, the reports also confirmed that NO was not able to significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in vivo (Jung et al. 2010). Exogenous or endogenous NO and inducible NOS expression exhibited no apparent antiviral effect on Sendai virus (Z strain) and influenza A virus (H2N2) in MDCK cells (Yoshitake et al. 2004). Similarly, Our results demonstrated that sufficient NO production could not suppress the propagation of PRRSV in vitro.

Marc-145 cells infected with PRRSV were treated by NAP at the concentration of 0, 100, 200 and 400 \u03bcM. ORF7 of PRRSV was detected by RT-PCR to evaluate the amount of viral RNA. Beta-actin was detected as a housekeeping gene. N protein of PRRSV was detected by Western blot and IFA using polyclonal antibody against N protein. a The product of RT-PCR was photographed under UV illumination and analyzed by gel layer scanning. b The expression level of N protein was analyzed by Western blot. c\u2013e N protein was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence analysis in PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells without treatments (c), PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells with NAP treatment (d) and mock-infected cells (e).
