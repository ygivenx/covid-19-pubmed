            "text": "In the small intestine, mature enterocytes near the top of the villi are the primary target cells for virus replication [29]. Replication in these cells provokes numerous intra- and extracellular pathological changes that inevitably lead to disruption of the absorptive and digestive functions of the small intestine, and consequently, to malabsorption and diarrhea. These changes include destruction of enterocyte brush borders, enterocyte vacuolization, loss and destruction of enterocytes, villus blunting and atrophy, thinning of the intestinal wall, and crypt hyperplasia (for comprehensive reviews, see [29, 39]). However, the nature and severity of histopathological alterations in vivo can be quite different depending on the species and virulence of the rotavirus strain. There is no clear correlation between these alterations and manifestation of clinical symptoms. A systemic inflammatory response can be absent, and rotavirus infections can be asymptomatic [29, 39]. This suggests that the interplay between host and viral factors is important for determining the course of this disease. For instance, rotavirus NSP4 acts as an enterotoxin that induces diarrhea in mice in the absence of rotavirus replication [5]. NSP4 affects Ca2+ and electrolyte homeostasis in an auto- and paracrine fashion in both rotavirus-infected and uninfected intestinal cells [41]. NSP4 increases Ca2+ permeability of the ER and plasma membrane, resulting in an increased Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol ([Ca2+]cyt), causing derailment of numerous Ca2+-dependent cellular processes [40]. In uninfected enterocytes and crypt cells this rise in [Ca2+]cyt is induced by binding of exogenous NSP4 to an apical receptor that modulates the PLC-IP3 pathway [16]. The higher [Ca2+]cyt triggers laminal secretion of peptides and amines by uninfected enterocytes, and luminal Cl\u2212 and H2O secretion by crypt cells [28, 39]. In infected enterocytes, the rise in [Ca2+]cyt is believed to be independent of PLC modulation [41], and this rise perturbs cytoskeleton and tight junction integrity, which ultimately leads to cell lysis [9, 10, 26, 37].",

            "text": "In vitro studies with cell lines, mainly derived from colon, have contributed significantly toward understanding the pathogenesis of rotavirus on a molecular level. However, the intestinal mucosa consists of a diversity of specialized cell types in different states of differentiation. Presumably, all these different types of cells respond differently to environmental changes, and accordingly to changes in their neighboring cells. Therefore, the regulation of genes responsible for these complex phenotypic responses in vivo may not be detected by challenging single types of cultured cells with rotavirus. To address this issue, we studied the early transcriptional response in jejunal mucosa of 3-week-old, just-weaned piglets after oral infection with virulent group A rotavirus. To assign measured responses exclusively to rotavirus, we performed these experiments in germ-free piglets. Differential expression patterns of uninfected versus infected jejunum were recorded 12 and 6 h before severe diarrhea was expected, using a homemade pig intestinal cDNA microarray [34]. The biological significance of elevated or reduced expression of these genes for rotavirus pathogenesis is discussed.",

On day 21, three of the seven piglets were transported to the necropsy room and served as uninfected control piglets. The four remaining pigs were orally infected with virus suspension diluted in a total volume of 5 ml PBS and containing 2 \u00d7 107 rotavirus particles (as determined by negative-stain semi-quantitative electron microscopy) of strain RV277 [45]. The virus suspension was prepared from the contents of the small and large intestine of a rotavirus-infected gnotobiotic piglet [32]. The above applied oral dose caused severe diarrhea from 24 hpi (hours post infection) in 3-week-old gnotobiotic piglets [32]. Infected piglets were housed in their isolators under the same conditions as described above for another period of 12 (two piglets) or 18 h (two piglets) before they were transported to the necropsy room. Immediately after arrival in the necropsy room, 10 ml of EDTA blood for hematological analysis was collected from the jugular vein. Subsequently, animals were killed by barbiturate overdose and their intestines were taken out. The jejunum was opened and rinsed with cold saline, and 10 cm of mucosa in the middle of the jejunum was scraped off with a glass slide, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at \u221270\u00b0C until RNA and DNA extraction. An adjacent part of the collected jejunum was fixed in 4% formaldehyde and used to determine the villus height and crypt depth. Villus and crypt dimensions were determined on hematoxylin-eosin-stained 5-\u03bcm tissue sections [34]. During the experiment, fecal samples were collected at 0, 12 and 18 hpi from the rectum for determination of the percent dry matter [18]. Fecal samples were tested for the presence or absence of rotavirus by ELISA [33]. The germ-free status of each piglet was confirmed by analyzing throat saliva and feces samples, collected on days 6, 12 and 19, and on the day of slaughter, for the presence of microorganisms.",

For practical reasons, three uninfected germ-free piglets were slaughtered at the zero time point (mock, see Table 1). In order to isolate high-quality RNA from jejunal mucosal scrapings, infected piglets were slaughtered 12 and 18 hpi. Thus, 12 and 6 h before severe diarrhea would have been induced. In three of the four infected animals, rotavirus was detected in their feces. Determination of the percent dry matter showed that only the fecal samples collected 18 hpi (piglets 65 and 67) had a significantly lower (pasty) consistency [18]. This indicated that not all of the piglets developed diarrhea before 12 hpi, and that the two piglets slaughtered 18 hpi did not develop the severe form of diarrhea normally observed at 24 hpi [32]. In jejunal tissue sections prepared from these two 18-h piglets, villus length was decreased to two-thirds of the average length measured in corresponding sections prepared from the three control piglets. No significant differences in crypt depths were observed between infected and control animals. For both piglets that were slaughtered at 18 h, these results indicated that the orally applied rotavirus reached the jejunum and induced the desired limited (not severe) pathological symptoms. In addition, the lower concentration of lymphocytes in the blood indicated that the animals were effectively infected with rotavirus [47].",

In RNA samples isolated from the three uninfected pigs, hardly any IFN-\u03b3 mRNA could be detected. In contrast, the IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels in scrapings of all infected piglets were up to 50-fold higher than in uninfected piglets, whereas OAZ1 mRNA levels were nearly equal for all RNA samples.

In two separate hybridization experiments, mRNA expression levels in an uninfected RNA pool (n = 3) were compared to expression levels in RNA pools prepared from 12- and 18-h infected piglets (both n = 2). For both comparisons, dye swaps were performed. Probes that hybridized differentially with a ratio (FC; infected over uninfected) of <0.28 or >3.6 in both slides of the dye-swap and that were identified with the lowest possible false-discovery rate (FDR; based on SAM, [43]), i.e., 0.35% for the 18-h comparison and 4.6% for the 12-h comparison, were selected for further analysis. Raising of the FDR to a maximum of 10% did not identify additional probes with a FC < 0.28 or >3.6 in either comparison. Selected probes were sequenced and annotated after blastn or blastx analysis (when not yet annotated). For each differential expressed probe, the mean FC calculated from the two dye-swap slides is presented in Table 2. When Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA was prepared from the same uninfected RNA pool and simultaneously hybridized on the array, none of the probes that hybridized differentially in the 12- and 18-h comparisons hybridized differentially (results not shown). Six out of the nine probes that hybridized with a FC of 3.6-fold or more in the 12-h comparison (panel \u201chigher in infected\u201d) also hybridized significantly more strongly in the 18-h comparison. For three of these probes (R14\u2013R16), the ratio of differential expression further increased with time. In contrast, only one probe (R1) hybridized significantly less strongly at both time points. Based on literature search and data mining, a tentative function was assigned for the genes identified by blast analysis (see Table 2). In addition, the FC (infected over uninfected) of genes which were also found to be regulated in a previous study by Cuadras et al. [13], i.e., 16 h after infection of human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells with rotavirus live virus vaccine RVV, is provided in parentheses in Table 2 after the annotations.",

In part, down-regulation of genes involved in transport of ions and nutrients over the membranes of mature enterocytes, like meprin A, SGLT1, and IFABp2, may be a direct result of this loss. In another part, replication of rotavirus in enterocytes imbedded in the epithelial layer could have down-regulated transcription of these genes. This may also be the case for other down-regulated genes from our list, especially for genes detected only at 18 hpi (R4\u2013R13, Table 2). In addition to down-regulation of SGLT1, IFABp2, and meprin A, we observed up-regulation of two other genes that may affect the absorptive and digestive function of the intestine: a gene coding for a protein carrying a Ca2+-permeable cation channel CD20/IgE Fc receptor subunit \u03b2 domain (MS4A2) and a gene homolog to a bacterial oligo/dipeptide permease (DppC-2). It is tempting to link up-regulation of MS4A2 directly to NSP4-induced enhancement of Ca2+ permeability of the plasma and ER membranes in intestinal epithelial cells [29, 40]. Likewise, up-regulation of the DppC-2 homolog may be related to enhanced laminal secretion of peptides and amines by uninfected epithelial cells, a process believed to be triggered by raised [Ca2+]cyt [40]. Characterization of these porcine transcripts/proteins is needed to provide further insight in the role of these genes in rotavirus pathogenesis. The same applies for the TMEM106B gene. This gene showed the highest level of up-regulation. So far, only a DUF1356 protein domain with unknown function has been predicted in TMEM106B.",

            "text": "Recently, it was reported that rotavirus infection in infant mice induced apoptosis in vivo [7]. Although DNA analysis showed that the majority of cells present in infected mucosal scrapings were not apoptotic, we observed up-regulation of the apoptosis effector protein CASP3. This suggests that programmed cell death in the epithelial layer was stimulated by rotavirus infection. NB analysis detected a considerable level of CASP3 mRNA expression in uninfected mucosal scrapings. This constitutive expression of CASP3 is, most likely, related to the process of maintenance of the absorptive status of the intestinal epithelial layer. A process in which mature enterocytes continually die due to apoptosis and are replaced by differentiating cells migrating from surrounding crypts to the tip of the villi [20]. In contrast to mature enterocytes, an in vivo study in mice showed that goblet cells are largely spared from apoptosis in rotavirus-infected mice [8]. Moreover, migration of goblet cells from the crypt to the tips of the villi was stimulated in these mice. We found up-regulation of the goblet cell marker gene KRT20 [51] and the lower and mid-villus immature enterocyte marker gene MGAM [42]. This could indicate that transcriptional activity in both of these cell types was promoted. Stimulation of apoptosis in rotavirus-infected enterocytes and higher proliferation/differentiating activity in goblet cells and immature enterocytes could be a coordinated response of the jejunum to remove infected enterocytes and overlay villus tips with fresh enterocytes, goblet cells, and mucus layer. We did not detect genes on our array that were directly associated with cell-cycle progression/arrest. However, down-regulation of the nuclear kinase FRK (an antagonist of cell proliferation) and TMS4F20 may be associated indirectly with this process. In humans, TMS4F20 is strongly homologous to TM4SF4, a protein that reduced the ability of the crypt cell line HT29 to proliferate [48].",

            "text": "Several other genes that may play a role in cell death and repair were regulated. SAT was up-regulated, and TXN and PRR13 were down-regulated. For this later protein, reduced expression in cells was correlated with increased sensitivity to taxane-induced cell death, a caspase-independent process characterized by the polymerization of tubulins to extraordinarily stable microtubules [27, 30]. TXN is the major carrier of redox potential in cells, and it is crucial for the defence of cells against oxidative-stress-mediated apoptosis. TXN also regulates gene expression by increasing binding of redox-sensitive transcription factors like p53 [44], NF-\u03baB [25], and the Nrf-2/polyamine-modulated factor-1 (PMF-1) transcription factor complex to DNA. Overexpression of TXN in human breast cells decreased DNA binding of the Nrf-2/PMF-1 complex and inhibited SAT expression [23]. Therefore, up-regulation of SAT gene expression at 18 hpi may be directly related to down-regulation of TXN at 12 hpi. SAT is a rate-limiting enzyme in spermine/spermidine metabolism. Acetylation of these polyamines by SAT promoted their degradation and excretion [46]. Recently, it was reported that depletion of polyamines suppresses apoptosis in normal intestinal epithelial cells by AKT-kinase-mediated inhibition of CASP3 activity [50]. NB analysis showed that the increase in SAT mRNA expression coincided with the goblet cell marker KRT20. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether SAT expression in goblet cells can be stimulated by rotavirus infection and whether it plays a role in protecting these cells from apoptosis [8]. Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that RNA viruses can directly modulate polyamine metabolism by regulation of SAT transcription and splicing [36].",

            "text": "A most interesting gene that we found more than tenfold up-regulated codes for an as yet not-well-characterized hypothetical human protein (LOC646627) carrying a phospholipase A2 inhibitor domain (PLA2-inh). The magnitude and kinetics of up-regulation of this gene corresponded exactly with GCNT3, suggesting that this gene was expressed in the same types of cells as GCNT3, most likely mucus-producing goblet cells and/or differentiating (immature) enterocytes. The amino acid sequence translated from our PLA2-inh EST showed an overall amino acid identity of 56%, and all cysteines aligned perfectly with cysteines of the human LOC646627 protein and of other proteins that bear a typical PLA2-inh domain. PLA2s comprise a diverse family of cytosolic and secreted enzymes that hydrolyze membrane phospholipids to free fatty acids. They play an important role in many exogenous and intracellular processes, ranging from fatty acid metabolism and lysis of membranes to the synthesis of arachidonic acid (A-acid), an essential precursor for the production of inflammatory mediators such as eicosanoids. Secreted PLA2s are calcium-dependent enzymes. Cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2) can also be calcium-independent. A moderate increase in [Ca2+]cyt mediated translocation of calcium-dependent cPLA2 to intracellular membranes where it hydrolyses phospholipids to A-acid [12]. A similar effect was observed after activation of the MS4A2 calcium-permeable cation channel (up-regulated here at 18 hpi, see above) on the surface of mast cells [14]. Perhaps, enhanced expression of a PLA2-inh in our study may be a countermeasure of specific intestinal epithelial cells to normalize and/or inhibit PLA2 enzyme activity in response to extra- and intracellular changes in [Ca2+] evoked by rotavirus replication, either to protect specific cells from extra- and intracellular membrane-damage or to negatively regulate A-acid production. With respect to the latter process, we observed down-regulation of the enzymes CYP2C39 and ACSL3, which both utilize A-acid acid as substrate. Interestingly, the capsid protein of parvovirus possesses PLA2 activity [49], and HMCV particles carry a cell-derived PLA2 activity [2]. For both viruses, PLA2 activity appeared to be essential for infectivity.",

This suggests that IFN-\u03b3 was produced for a short period. Recently, Aich et al. [1] measured the mRNA expression levels of several cytokines in jejunal loops perfused for 18 h with BRV. However, they observed no IFN-\u03b3 mRNA response. Because our orally administered rotavirus needed time to reach the jejunum, our 18 h infection period represents a shorter period than 18 h of perfusion. After 18 h of perfusion, expression of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA may have dropped to normal levels. Interestingly, they did detect a rotavirus-induced IL-6 (alias IFN-\u03b2 2) mRNA response at 18 hpi [1]. Recent studies showed that the interplay between IFN-gamma and IL-6 controls the influx and clearance of neutrophils and, subsequently, the transition to a more sustainable influx of mononuclear cells during acute inflammation [21, 31]. Therefore, it would be interesting to study which immune cells produce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 and whether an orchestrated action of these cells regulates an influx of vital immune cells in the jejunum after rotavirus infection.",

Overexpression of GBP-1 and GBP-2 in HeLa cells and NIH 3T3 cells abrogated the cytopathogenic effect mediated by VSV and EMCV, respectively, by an unknown mechanism [3, 11]. Furthermore, it was shown that expression of murine GBP-2 in NIH 3T3 cells neutralized the cytotoxic effect of the taxane drug Paclitaxel [4]. This drug specifically stimulates polymerization of tubulins to extraordinarily stable microtubules. These stable microtubules interfere with the function of normal microtubule filaments and inevitably induce cell death [4]. The reduced expression of PRR13 we observed (discussed above) may be an indication that the formation of extraordinarily stable microtubules in intestinal epithelial cells actually takes place in response to rotavirus infection. In fact, several studies have shown that rotavirus infection induces disorganization of the cytoskeleton network and microtubule filaments in enterocytes [9, 10, 26]. Moreover, we also observed the up-regulation of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-inducible gene IFI44, a cytosolic protein associated with microtubular structures, and the cytoskeleton gene ACTB. Therefore, enhanced expression of GBP-2 in specific intestinal epithelial cells could contribute to a cellular mechanism(s) that impairs and/or prevents disorganization of the microtubule filaments.",
