If so, which alternative approaches would be effective and embraced by the community? Are there simply too many conferences? Is bigger really better and can online photonics meetings be truly successful? Here we consider such questions, and we welcome your feedback on the future role and shape of conferences for scientific exchange.",

A large number of photonics meetings now overlap in topics. A nanophotonics researcher cannot realistically attend all available conferences that cover plasmonics and metamaterials meetings, nor should they. The personal, financial, time and environmental burdens are too significant. And, let\u2019s be honest, the list of presenters (along with their slides) can be repetitious, particularly for plenary and keynote sessions.",

James Schuck (University of Columbia) who feels that many meetings started as smaller, more specialized symposia, and then grew, resulting in many overlapping in topics. Reducing an event\u2019s scope and keeping it tightly defined so that researchers don\u2019t feel like they have to be at each meeting that covers their field is an option according to Schuck who points out that \u201cthe only real way to deal with the huge parallel-session conferences is to pick one or two symposia to concentrate on (thus not getting the benefit of the larger population).\u201d Arguably, smaller meetings also have better opportunities for early-career researchers to mix more intimately with well-established leaders.",

Schuck does also question if people pay attention to online seminars in the same way they do to in-person presentations, but admits that sometimes he feels like \u201chalf the audience at a conference is checking e-mail anyway.\u201d",
