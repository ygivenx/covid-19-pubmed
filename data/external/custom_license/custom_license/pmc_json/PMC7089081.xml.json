Approximately 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A occur every year worldwide, predominantly in developing countries (Di Giammarino and Dienstag 2005). Consequently, it is responsible for a substantial economic burden to society in terms of direct treatment cost and indirect productivity loses (Keystone and Hershey 2008). This disease is caused by Hepatitis A virus (HAV) which belongs to the genus Hepatovirus of the Picornaviridae family that primarily infects hepatocytes. It can cause effects that range from the slight symptoms such as fever, anorexia, nausea to death from fulminant hepatitis (Martin and Lemon 2006). Transmission of HAV is mainly through the faecal\u2013oral route by contaminated water and food in global perspective (Hadler et al. 1980). However, in some areas, e.g., the United States, the most common reported source of infection is household or other close contact with an infected person (Victor et al. 2007).",

They are long-term protective and highly immunogenic in both children and adults (Van Damme and Van Herck 2005). The administration of Immunoglobulins (Igs) provides short-term effective protection (Larralde et al. 2007). It is mainly for people exposed to the high risk of infection, such as people traveling to places where the virus is endemic or who have close personal contact with a Hepatitis A patient (Kim et al. 2004). Furthermore, Igs are the only product recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis in the United States and Igs administered intramuscularly is the product used for the prevention of HAV infection (CDC 2006). However, Igs against HAV is mainly derived from human plasma, which led to limited supply and possible healthy risks due to its impurity. Therefore, the application of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been considered as an alternative approach against HAV infection, because mAbs have proven to be the well-characterized and highly effective products with better activity than their polyclonal counterparts (Lonberg 2005; Marasco and Sui 2007).",

Accordingly, the rapidly growing market demand has driven a wide range of mAbs applications. Even with conservative prediction, mAbs will probably have global sales of $20 billion by the year 2010 (Gottschalk 2005). The platforms for the mAbs production are variable but critical owing to the significant impact on the level and quality of the products (Keefer 2004). Most of the mAbs approved for commercialization are currently produced by mammalian cell culture; however, this system faces a shortage of production capacity and scale-up production will be inevitably associated with extremely high costs. Besides, in different culture conditions, there are pitfalls in complicated purification steps as well as variable mAbs levels and post-translational modifications (Castillo 1999; Farid 2007; Kozlowski and Swann 2006; Winokur and Stapleton 1992). These limitations have motivated researches to develop alternative production technologies with higher efficiency.",

            "text": "Technology advances in genetic engineering opened up a way for the cost-effective, large-scale production of mAbs using the mammary gland of transgenic animals. This method is capable of high level expression at low cost, associated with the required complex post-translational modifications, constant secretion and stable bioactivity of these proteins. Thus this production system can avoid the pitfalls associated with other expression systems and makes transgenic production of mAbs attractive (Dove 2002; Dyck et al. 2003; Houdebine 2002). In recent years, there have been many successful examples of mAbs expression in the milk of transgenic mice with production levels of up to several mg per ml; such as mAbs against Coronavirus, Hantavirus, CD20 and CD69 (Castilla et al. 1998; Molina et al. 2003; Sola et al. 1998; Tang et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2006). Moreover, it is noteworthy that recombinant human antithrombin III produced in the mammary gland of transgenic goats has been approved as a drug by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in 2006, which launched as ATryn in the treatment of blood clotting. This demonstrates the commercial reality of protein mass-production by transgenic animals. Therefore in this paper, we expressed a human mAb in the milk of transgenic mice, and explored its potential effect on immunoprophylaxis of HAV infection. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility for a large-scale production of the mAbs against HAV in the milk of transgenic farm animals in the future.",

Four replicates of each sample were inoculated onto the monolayers of FRhK-4 cells growing in 24 wells plates. Mock infected cells were included as HAV negative control. In addition, HAV virus titre was also measured by ELISA. After all the plates were incubated at 33\u00b0C for 1.5 h and the medium removed, 1.0 ml of fresh culture medium was added to the wells of each plate.

In this paper, we demonstrate that both the HC and LC of the anti-HAV antibody can be expressed in the milk of transgenic mice under control of the goat \u03b2-casein promoter, as well as be properly assembled into functional IgG molecule against HAV. We incorporated two strategies into vector design to enhance transgene expression. First, the chicken \u03b2-globin insulator is predicted to reduce the influence of neighboring regulatory elements, thereby it modulating the positive effects caused by the random integration of the transgenes in the host chromosome (Chung et al. 1997). Secondly, genomic rather than cDNA fragments of IgG constant regions were used to benefit from potential enhancer-like effects of its introns (Whitelaw et al. 1991). The high levels of mAb expression that we observed were consistent with the results using these two strategies, though position effects, e.g., line 15 with extremely low expression level, were still observed. Furthermore, most of the mice carried both transgenes, however, when mating the founder transgenic mice with the non-transgenic mice, the resulting single chain of the transgenic offspring might be due to the segregation of the transgenes from different chromosomal sites for some founders. The majority of the transgenic founders transmitted both transgenes to their offspring, which agrees with most of previous studies reported that co-microinjection normally led to both transgenes co-integrated into a single chromosomal site (Clark et al. 1992; Tang et al. 2008).",

No direct relationship between the transgene copy number and the amount of mAb was observed in the detected transgenic mice, implying that the integration site of the transgene had a greater effect on the expression level than that of transgene copy number (Table 1) which is consistent with the previous finding (Sola et al. 1998).",

Specifically, in our experiment, presence of additional weak bands in the western blotting under non-reducing condition indicated that there were small portion of the incompletely folded IgG molecules. Several explanations have been proposed to interpret this phenomenon; we suggest the most likely explanation relates to the presence of free sulfhydryl in the mAb (Zhang and Czupryn 2002). Each IgG molecule consists of two heavy and two light chains covalently linked by interchain disulfide bonds, with in addition, each domain of the heavy or light chain containing one additional disulfide bond. Some mAb species containing free sulfhydryl are likely to be formed during the protein folding process in the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, in our experiment, minor proportion of the formed recombinant mAb in the epithelial cells in the mammary gland of mice may lack interchain disulfide bonds but remain noncovalently associated under non-reducing conditions presenting as low MW fragments in our analysis.",

The antigen-binding activity of mAb was demonstrated in the specific ELISA, which represented a nearly 40-fold increase in the antibody affinity. Through a virus neutralization assay with previously tested CHO-derived HAIgG78 as the control, we verified that transgenic milk produced mAb was as effective as the HAIgG78 in neutralizing HAV and preventing infection of FRhK4 cells (Fig. 5).",

This work solidifies the concept of using larger transgenic animals for the production of a potentially therapeutic anti-HAV antibody. With the ever-growing market need for large quantities of mAbs, transgenic large animals will provide a cost-competitive large-scale production alternative for these complex proteins. Furthermore, this method will also facilitate the commercial production of mAbs using transgenic bioreactors for immunoprophylaxis.",
