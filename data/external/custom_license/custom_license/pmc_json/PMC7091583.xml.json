The genomic and the subgenomic mRNAs of coronaviruses include an identical 5\u2032 Leader sequence and common 3\u2032-ends, which is a unique characteristic in coronavirus and arterivirus replication.8 In the process of coronavirus replication, the Leader sequence (from the subgenome) is fused to the mRNA body sequence. The mechanism by which these subgenomic mRNAs are made is not fully understood. However, recent evidence indicates that transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) at the 5\u2032-end of each gene represent signals that regulate the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs.9, 10 Nevertheless, the Leader sequence and the TRSs play critical roles in the gene expression of coronavirus during its replication.9, 10",

Putative conserved TRS sequences AAACGAAAC were determined through manual alignment of sequences upstream of potential initiating methionine codons with the region of the coronavirus genome sequence containing the Leader sequence. These predictions suggested that SARS-CoV possessed a similar genome structure and underwent similar replication processes to those of other typical coronaviruses.11, 12 Therefore, it is of interest to search for a way to block virus replication based on this common feature of the coronavirus.",

Therefore, choosing a unique sequence in the SARS-CoV genome will be critical for the successful inhibition of the virus. In this report, we propose to target the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV, which is identical in all SARS-CoV and plays a pivotal role in the gene expression of the virus. We demonstrate the siRNA we generated could effectively and specifically silence gene expression and inhibit SARS-CoV replication in cultured mammalian cells. Our data provide a possible way of using gene therapy for SARS.",

To clone the Leader sequence predicted from BJ01 SARS CoV, we performed 5\u2032-RACE experiments to confirm the Leader sequence. We then used RT-PCR to obtain the cDNA of the transcripts of different genes of BJ01 SARS-CoV from infected Vero E6 cells. After sequencing, we observed the identical Leader sequence upstream of the ATGs in the different genes (Figure 1a, GenBank accession numbers AY539954, AY536757, AY536758, AY536759, AY536760), suggesting that the transcripts of different genes in BJ01 SARS-CoV recruited the identical Leader sequence, which is consistent with the report from HKU-39849.15 The data indicated that the transcript of the S protein contained the Leader sequence directly upstream of the ATG, while the transcripts of other proteins had different nucleotide bases between the ATG and the conserved Leader sequence (eg M protein has 44 more base pairs) (Figure 1a). Intriguingly, this Leader sequence was highly conserved between different strains of SARS-CoV, while the other sequences coding for the specific proteins such as S, N, M and E contained various mutations between the different strains (Table 1). According to this information, the sequence of CCAACCAACCTCGATCTC was selected and designed as the siRNA target for the proper GC/AT ratio and CC structure. To generate the dsRNA based on this sequence, we employed the U6 promoter vector33 and constructed a 22 bp siRNA through the hairpin (Figure 1b). The expected hairpin RNA is depicted in Figure 1c.",

In contrast, using primers a, d and e, we obtained two bands as predicted in cells transfected with pDsRed1.1/L-RFP (Figure 2b, lane 8) and one band with pDsRed1.1/RFP (Figure 2b, lane 7).

Importantly, pBS/U6/L-RNAi did not have any affect on the expression of either RFP or GFP proteins driven by the constructs without the Leader sequence of SARS-CoV (Figure 4Aa\u2013c).

These data are consistent and supportive of those observed by fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, to determine whether the inhibition of the siRNA on reporter gene expression is dependent on the amount of the siRNA, we used three different dosages of the pBS/U6/L-RNAi plasmid (0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcg) cotransfected with 0.5 \u03bcg of pEFBos/L-GFP. Western blot analysis suggests that the GFP protein levels decreased gradually with increasing amounts of pBS/U6/L-RNAi plasmid (Figure 5b). Intriguingly, 1.0 \u03bcg of pBS/U6/L-RNAi plasmid almost totally inhibited the expression of the reporter gene, indicating that the siRNA effectively silenced the expression of the reporter gene with the Leader sequence from SARS-CoV.",

After 72 h of culture, to demonstrate the inhibition of SARS-CoV, we stained the cells with crystal violet (Figure 8a). The results show that the cells infected with SARS-CoV exhibited greater resistance to virus infection, because the Vero E6 (L-RNAi) cells were stained as strongly as the noninfected cells were (Figure 8a, plates 1 and 3), while the Vero E6, Vero E6 (U6) and Vero E6 (U6/GFP-RNAi) cells stained equally weakly (plates 2, 4 and 5) demonstrating cell destruction. Furthermore, we viewed the cells for morphological changes (Figure 8b). Significant cytopathic effects were seen in the plates with the Vero E6 wild-type cell, Vero E6 (U6) cells and Vero E6 (U6/GFP-RNAi) cells (Figure 6e, 2, 4, 5), while the noninfected cells (Figure 8b, 1) and SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 (U6/L-RNAi) cells (Figure 8b, 3) maintained their normal morphology. To measure the virus levels in the infected cells, we used real-time PCR to determine MOI of the virus. The data show that only the cells with the Leader sequence siRNA had a low virus titer, while the other cells expressed high titers of virus (Figure 8c).

Therefore, targeting the Leader sequence present in the mRNA of SARS-CoV structural genes, should be a powerful way to control virus replication. Interestingly, we analyzed all the strains of SARS-CoV identified to date and found that the Leader sequence remained almost identical (see Table 1). With these advantages, we designed the siRNA to target this Leader sequence of SARS-CoV. Our data show that the siRNA could not only block the expression of a reporter gene fused with the Leader sequence but also inhibited the expressions of SARS-CoV genes in Vero E6 cells, and thereafter inhibited the replication of the SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. We proposed that this would be a powerful tool to prevent SARS-CoV infections in vivo.",

Our data further indicated that the sequence between the identical Leader sequence and ATG in different transcripts was variable. The S gene has no space between the common Leader sequence and ATG, and the M gene has the longest spacer sequence. This implied that the common Leader sequence had different merging sites to the sequence of different genes in SARS-CoV.

However, empirically, siRNA could only knock down the expression of the targeted gene expression. Therefore, designing an siRNA targeting several genes should provide better inhibition of virus replication. To this aim, the Leader sequence in SARS-CoV provided a very useful target because it is part of the mRNAs of each gene critical to SARS-CoV replication. Indeed, our experiments showed that siRNA targeting the Leader sequence was more effective than siRNA for the S gene. Also, our data indicated that the siRNA targeting the Leader sequence was powerful compared to antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. There might be several reasons for the lower effectiveness of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides including lower transfection efficiency, digestion by DNAse and lower transcription of antisense mRNA in the nucleus.",
