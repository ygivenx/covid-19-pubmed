Even\nthough reactive isatins prefer nucleophilic additions at the C3-position,11\u221217 the control of N1- and C3-functionalization\nhas been tried by various synthetic strategies (N-alkylation,18\u221221 N-acylation,22,23 N-carbamoylation,24 N-Mannich reaction,25,26 and aza-Michael addition reaction27\u221234). Despite reports, efficient chemoselective N1-functionalization\nof isatin is still difficult because of the undesired reactions resulting\nfrom the multifunctionality of isatins. The first undesired side reaction\nin the functionalization of isatins is the decomposition of isatins\ninto isatinates.35\u221237",

Notably,\naza-Michael reaction of Kanger group\u2019s isatin Schiff imine\nare only applicable for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors,28\u221230 and ketal/thioketal shows a loss of isatins as well as a high E-factor\n(low atom economy) through protection/reaction/deprotection procedures\n(Supporting Information).21,32 Recently, aza-Michael addition of isatins without any C3-protecting group27,33,34 made us to expect efficient direct N1-functionalization\nto be more considerable in view of green chemistry (E-factor, atom\neconomy, and step economy).

The detailed reaction conditions and results are\npresented in Table 1. For the preliminary study, base condition of the reaction was investigated\nin the presence of the IMes\u00b7Cl precatalyst in the selected solvent,\ndichloromethane (entries 1\u20136). The intended roles of the inorganic/organic\nbase are (a) to generate in situ organo-NHCs from IMes\u00b7Cl and\n(b) to assist the organo-NHC catalyst-directed path in the aza-Michael\nreaction. The combination of the IMes\u00b7Cl precatalyst with relatively\nmild inorganic/organic bases (Et3N or K2CO3 or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)) resulted in\na highly chemoselective aza-Michael addition in dichloromethane (DCM)\nto produce NS-isatin 3aa as the sole product (entries\n3\u20135). On the other hand, the combination of IMes\u00b7Cl with\nthe strong bases KOt-Bu and NaH resulted in the formation\nof 3aa along with other unidentified products (entries\n1 and 2). The best result was observed under the IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU\ncondition with high chemoselectivity and the maximum yield of 81%\n(entry 5). Surprisingly, in contrast to other entries, IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO\nproduced a MBH product from 1a and 2a (entry\n6). Because DABCO is a weaker base than DBU in terms of pKa (pKa values of their conjugated\nacid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): Et3N\u2013H+ pKa \u223c 18.82, DBU\u2013H+ pKa \u223c 24.34, and DABCO\u2013H+ pKa \u223c 8.9),52 it is not sufficient for capturing the NH proton\nof isatin, but sufficient for mediating the MBH reaction. Under the\noptimal condition of entry 5, we also compared the catalytic efficacy\nof four well-known organo-NHC precatalysts (entries 5, 7\u20139)\nto prove that NHC catalysis can produce chemoselective aza-Michael\nadducts consistently.",

In the\ncase of the THF solvent, the IMes\u00b7Cl (A) is sparingly soluble\nin the solvent to present a very low yield (entry 14). At this juncture,\nwe tried to add a catalytic amount of more polar solvent DMSO to the\nIMes\u00b7Cl/DBU system to improve the solubility and the reaction\nrate with the related reports of Arduengo and others.53,54 The white turbid THF solution containing IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU (Figure 2a) became a clear,\nlight yellow solution immediately on the addition of DMSO (Figure 2b), which indicates\nthe fast generation of in situ organo-NHC.

Under the optimized NHC/DABCO\nconditions, our plausible catalytic cycle proposed for the MBH reaction\nis described in path B (Scheme 2). The nucleophilic addition of acrylate with in situ-generated\norgano-NHC by the treatment of a DABCO base produced a zwitterionic\nhomoenolate I, whereas this homoenolate I did not capture a proton from the conjugate acid (DABCO\u2013H+) because of the low Lewis basicity of DABCO compared with\nDBU.63 At this time, the nucleophilic attack\nof the NHC acrylate zwitterionic species I to the electrophilic\nC3-keto carbonyl site of NS-isatin forms the second zwitterionic\nspecies V followed by proton transfer toward the elimination\nof free-NHC to form the aza-Michael\u2013Baylis-oxindole derivative VI.",
