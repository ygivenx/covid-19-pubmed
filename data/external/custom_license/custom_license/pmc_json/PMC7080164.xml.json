To ensure the provision of safe and reliable cells and tissues for these applications, it is necessary to regulate the procurement, processing, testing, preservation, storage and distribution of all cells destined for application in the human body. These functions are entrusted to the tissue banks, although each one will have its differentiating nuances depending on the types of tissues handled and patient groups served. These establishments should be designed to meet the requirements for tissue banks as outlined in national recommendations (Department of Health 2001; American Association of Tissue Banks 2002) and under specific international standards (e.g. International Organization for Standardization 1999) and accredited by an appropriate competent authority (Directive 2004/23/CE). Although numerous tissue banks in Europe have been accredited by national inspection, there are specific requirements for banks of human stem cell lines, which have been addressed at the UK Stem Cell Bank (NIBSC), which was accredited by the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in 2004 (Pincock 2004; Mayor 2004) under the UK Code of Practice for Tissue Banks (2001) that is based on the UK Orange Guide (GPMD 2002), the UK Blood Transfusion Service \u201cRed Book\u201d (UKBTS/NIBSC 2002).",

Thus, within the quality assurance programmes in these establishments, one of the fundamental pillars is the adequate preparation and introduction of a microbiological, environmental and biosafety quality assurance programme. Obviously, serious human pathogens present a risk to other processed tissues and staff as well as the recipient patients. Furthermore, any microbiological contamination of donor material introduced during the manufacturing process can potentially multiply during the processing stage and present a serious hazard to recipients even if it is not an overt pathogen. Each cell culture process provides ideal conditions for the growth of many organisms, including viruses. The use of antibiotics will not necessarily protect against microbial growth and may only mask the presence of certain organisms by inhibiting, but not eliminating, them and leaving a masked contaminant that may well infect any future recipient of a stem cell line. The four key areas in this microbiological control are:\nDonors of biological material, including pre-embryos: appropriate screening should be carried out to avoid the transmission of infectious agents.\u201cFeeder\u201d cells, cell line products, and other biological reagents and products used in cell culture procedures are further potential sources of contamination, and very strict controls should be established on their sourcing and quality control.Environmental control, working conditions and laboratory plans for processing and storage areas.Safety testing regimes for stem cell banks.\n",

            "text": "All human cells (including reproductive cells) have the potential to transmit infectious diseases. In the past, donors have been screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and for hepatitis viruses, mainly B (HBV) and C (HCV) (US Food and Drugs Administration 1999; Department of Health 2000). These tests have been carried out using currently available protocols that are based on the detection of donor antibody response to viral infection. Research has shown that the detection of antibodies exclusively runs the risk of samples for tests being taken during an antibody-negative window period of these infections (i.e. absence of reactive antibodies), where an individual has been exposed to viral infection and indeed can be viraemic (Hitzler and Runkel 2001). HCV and HIV are potentially the agents of most concern in this category, where individuals have been shown to be negative for the presence of reactive antibodies but, however, are viraemic for a number of months before seroconversion (Schreiber et al. 1996; Stramer et al. 2004). This finding has led to the introduction of nucleic acid amplification techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which the presence of a virus can be observed by means of the amplification of sequences in the viral genome. Although the prevalence rates of HBV, HCV, HIV and human T cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) are lower among tissue donors than in the general population (Dodd et al. 2000), the estimated probability of undetected viremia at the time of tissue donation is higher among tissue donors than among first-time blood donors (Janssen et al. 1998; Dodd et al. 2002). The addition of nucleic acid test (NAT) methods to the screening of tissue donors, and to the testing of derived cell lines, should reduce the risk of these infections among recipients of stem cell lines (Zou et al. 2004).",

In Spain, the determination of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HCV antibody, CMV antibody and toxoplasma antibody for heart transplants is mandatory. Also, the HTLV-I/HTLV-II antibodies determination would be made only when risk factors were identified for the donor (Consensus Document 1999). Although this list might be expanded even further in light of developing knowledge and technology, it is inevitable that a balance will be drawn between the associated risk of infection and the resources and time required to perform an ever-increasing list of virus tests.\n\n\n",

Most of these viruses could be screened for by PCR tests on the biological products; however, the work involved in establishing a clinically validated test cannot be underestimated and should include the establishment and use of appropriate national or international reference materials (Saldanha 2001). As these viruses are so ubiquitous, there may be no clinical impact of their presence in transplanted tissues and cells for the majority of patients, and in certain cases, such as parvovirus B19, contamination of blood products up to a maximum limit (currently 105 genome equivalents per dose for B19) is acceptable for use in humans. However, in some instances, these agents can prove to be of concern. In heart transplant patients, the transfer of an organ from a CMV-positive donor to a recipient who has never been exposed to the virus can prove to be fatal, owing to the high degree of immunosuppression that is required for these patients to avoid rejection. Accordingly, all infectious agents should be considered as potential pathogens, and a risk balance for the use of contaminated products established, which should include consideration of the recipient's prior exposure and competence to fight infection.",

Therefore, there is a potential risk that the cells and tissues donated can be infected by this type of virus. These viruses can multiply in the majority of human cells, and so, the virus can compromise biological products. It is noteworthy that this virus is only one of a group of arthropod-borne viruses that can infect humans, so awareness amongst tissue coordinators of new outbreaks of such disease or new emerging diseases is important in the safety of human transplantation and the use of tissue products.",

Moreover, specific tests for the detection of bacteria, yeast and fungi should be used as part of a routine and regular quality control screening procedure. To detect low levels of infection, samples from the cell cultures and their products may be inoculated in either liquid (e.g. tryptone soya broth and fluid thioglycollate medium) or onto solid (e.g. tripticase\u2013soya agar, blood agar, Sabouraud's dextrose agar and malt extract agar) growth media. Standard protocols for such testing are given as pharmacopoeial standards (European Pharmacopeia 2002; European Pharmacopeia 2004a,b).

As a result of this, preventive measures should be implemented with respect to blood products, cell or tissue grafts and the decontamination of surgical instruments. The diagnosis in these cases can be carried out by means of the detection of resistant prionic protein (PrPres) by different methods: chemiluminescence, immunoassays in sandwich, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) sandwich and PCR. Although the specificity of these diagnostic methods is nearly 100% (Ironside 1996; Lee et al. 2000; Wadsworth et al. 2001), the sensitivity is inadequate to assure the value of a negative result.

There are a variety of methods for detecting and monitoring environmental air quality and contaminants, including the use of devices, settle plates and contact plates or swabs (EC Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice 2003; European Pharmacopoeia 2004a,b). Settle plates are most effective when used to study different points throughout the laboratory and identify foci of contamination risk. These plates should be open for approximately 4 h; after this time, they should be covered and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h (Parenteral Society 2002). At the end of this period the plates should be examined to rule out the presence of micro-organism growth. To obtain environmental monitoring data that relates to ISO air quality standards (e.g. International Organization for Standardization 1999) an air sampling system can be used to which a contact plate can be attatched. This system samples large air volumes and provides greater reliability with respect to the microbial charge at each point in the laboratory space.",
