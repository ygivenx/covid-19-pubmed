            "text": "Wound closure requires concerted efforts of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Following the inflammatory phase, basal keratinocytes at the wound edge begin migrating as a sheet to cover the wound surface - a process referred to as \u201cre-epithelialization\u201d [1]. While keratinocytes migrate and divide to generate a protective layer for the dermis, resident dermal fibroblasts from the deep layers of the reticular dermis and the hypodermis, as well as fibroblasts differentiating from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the circulation enter the wound, and synthesize extracellular matrix components needed for structural repair [2, 3]. Clinically, defects in keratinocyte migration are associated with chronic non-healing wounds, while the presence of excess fibroblasts in the wound seems to contribute to hypertrophic scar formation [4, 5].",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN, also known as APN/CD13; EC.3.4.11.2) is a heavily glycosylated transmembrane peptidase [6] that also serves as a receptor for coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and human coronavirus 229E [7, 8]. It is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts, fibroblast-like cells such as synoviocytes, epithelial cells, and synaptic membranes and pericytes [9\u201314]. With dual roles as a peptide-cleaving enzyme and a cell surface receptor, APN/CD13 performs a myriad of functions in tumor cell invasion, proliferation/apoptosis, differentiation, antigen presentation, and viral infection [15]. However, due to the short intracellular domain lacking obvious signaling motifs [16], APN/CD13 was not regarded as a signal mediator until recently [17]. Since then, the functionality of APN/CD13 has expanded to adhesion, angiogenesis, and monocyte signaling [18\u201320]. For instance, Wulfaenger et al. associated the expression of enzymatically active wild-type APN/CD13 with diminished cell proliferation, migration and invasion in embryonic kidney cells [21]. Meanwhile, Pasqualini et al. demonstrated that APN/CD13 peptidase activity is necessary for endothelial invasion [17]. The broad functionality and wide-ranging expression pattern suggest that the function of this transmembrane peptidase may very well depend on the cell type and tissue origin.",

Although the exact role of APN/CD13 in skin disease remains to be elucidated, its preferential expression in fibroblasts and its implication in tumor cell invasion make targeting APN/CD13 of potential value [23\u201326]. Considering the fact that cell migration is critical for the wound healing process, the present study investigated whether APN/CD13 plays a role in the cell migration of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and examined the potential of APN/CD13-specific antibodies as a therapeutic agent for high cellularity seen in fibroproliferative disorders such as hypertrophic scarring.",

Images of cells were taken at 0, 12, and 24 h post-treatment (Fig. 1a). The total number of cells in the untreated (control) and antibody-treated wells that have migrated into the open wound area by the end of the 12- and 24-h incubation was recorded. Cell migration was evaluated as the percentage of cells present in the open wound area of the treated wells relative to the control well at the end of the 24-h incubation. There was no significant difference between treatment and control at 12 h post-scratch. However, at the end of the 24-h incubation when the control wound has closed, the WM15-treated cells showed a 42% reduction in migratory activity relative to the control, whereas the 3D8 and H300 antibodies slowed down cell migration by 21 and 28%, respectively (Fig. 1b). To examine whether the differential effect of the antibodies on cell migration inhibition is related to their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of endogenous APN/CD13, human dermal fibroblasts treated with the same concentrations of antibodies used in the scratch assay, and the enzymatic activity was measured using a chromogenic substrate, Ala-4 nitroanilide. As shown in Fig. 1c, 3D8, WM15, and H300 reduced the endogenous APN/CD13 enzymatic activity by 36, 76, and 9%, respectively.\n",

A density-dependent protein expression was observed following immunoblotting analysis. The APN/CD13 expression peaked at 1.0 \u00d7 105 cell/cm2 where cells are most likely in the proliferative and migratory phase of growth. This expression quickly diminished as fibroblasts reached confluency at higher cell densities. In addition, we analyzed the APN/CD13 expression in a fibroblast migration assay (scratch assay), where a confluent monolayer at its maximal density was \u201cwounded\u201d by removing several wide bands of cells in both X and Y dimensions. Migration of fibroblasts into the open wound area occurred within 24 h before the cells were lysed for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. When compared to uninjured cells, cell populations of migratory fibroblasts displayed a 20% higher expression of the APN/CD13 protein (Fig. 5b). Further, expression of the APN/CD13 protein on individual migratory cells was examined. A scratch wound was made across a confluent monolayer of dermal fibroblasts, and vinculin expression was used as an indicator of cells in motion. As shown in the upper panels of Fig. 5c, APN/CD13 expression was highest in the actively migrating cells within the denuded wound area, and lowest in the stationary cells distant from the wound scratch. As shown in the merged image, staining the same cell population with an anti-vinculin antibody confirmed significant overlap in the expression of APN/CD13 and vinculin.

For instance, Mina-Osorio et al. utilized anti-APN/CD13 antibodies to induce adhesion of monocytes and endothelial cells [20]. In this study, we took advantage of the preferential expression of APN/CD13 in fibroblasts, and proved for the first time that the APN/CD13-neutralizing antibody WM15 can be used to effectively reduce the migration of fibroblasts into an open scratch wound without slowing down keratinocyte movement. Similarly to the previous finding using human lung cancer cells [24], the inhibitory effect of the antibodies on cell migration is only partly due to the suppression of APN/CD13 enzymatic activity as shown by the enzymatic assay results. The most potent cell migration-inhibiting WM15 antibody is also the most effective enzymatic inhibitor. The other two antibodies 3D8 and H300 have similar effects on cell migration inhibition (21 vs. 28%) but suppress the enzymatic activity differently (35 vs. 15%), indicating that the observed cell migration-inhibitory effect is not entirely dependent on the enzymatic activity of APN/CD13. One possible reason is the differential binding avidity of 3D8 and H300 (monoclonal vs. polyclonal). Importantly, fibroblasts and keratinocytes were both able to maintain a healthy state even after days of exposure to WM15, preparing the antibody in a better position for in vivo clinical use which may require longer exposure to be effective. With the use of activity inhibitors, actinonin, bestatin, and PAQ-22, Thielitz et al. reported a direct correlation between enzyme activity and cell proliferation in HaCaT cells, but did not observe any antiproliferative effect by WM15 [32]. This reconfirmed our finding that neither fibroblast nor keratinocyte proliferation was affected by the presence of WM15. Thus, WM15 which has an effective dosage of as low as 1.0 \u03bcg/ml in vitro is unlikely to reduce the viability of fibroblasts and keratinocytes or impair normal wound healing.",

Nevertheless, fibroblasts and keratinocytes are most likely to adopt distinctive regulatory mechanisms in cell migration due to differences in their external environments and surrounding cells. Thus, in order to understand why the APN/CD13-neutralizing antibody WM15 affects the migratory capacity of fibroblasts but not that of keratinocytes, more work on the mechanistic details involved in fibroblast migration will be needed. Meanwhile, a plausible rationale suggests that the differential effect might be due to enhanced antibody responsiveness in fibroblasts which have higher levels of APN/CD13 expression and activity than keratinocytes.",

Kehlen and colleagues [35, 36] have shown that direct cell\u2013cell contact of lymphocytes with fibroblast-like synoviocytes resulted in an increase in APN/CD13 mRNA and cell surface protein in the lymphocytes. In that regard, fibroblasts seeded at a lower cell density (5.0 \u00d7 104 cell/cm2) expressed less APN/CD13 possibly due to lack of cell\u2013cell contact, while the limited space at higher cell densities (5.0 \u00d7 105 and 1.0 \u00d7 106 cell/cm2) prevented cell movement by contact inhibition. Further, immunohistochemical staining of cells migrating into an artificially created scratch wound showed that compared to stationary cells, actively migrating cells as indicated by vinculin expression [37, 38] were expressing significantly more APN/CD13.
