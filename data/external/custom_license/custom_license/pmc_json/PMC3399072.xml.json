During the last two decades, the use of herbal medicines has expanded globally and gained considerable attention because of their low toxicity and good therapeutic performance [2]. Scutellaria baicalensis (referred to in TCM as \u201chuang qin\u201d) is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in TCM. Baicalin is the most abundant active component in huang qin and is an important secondary metabolite in S. baicalensis induced by exogenous stress. It has anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, anti-tumor and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus effects [3]. The ever-increasing demand for huang qin has stimulated the improvement of cultivated practices of S. baicalensis.",

LaCl3 treatment resulted in a JA burst and an increase in baicalin production.

Direct application of JA also induced baicalin synthesis, suggesting exogenous JA alone can induce baicalin synthesis in S. baicalensis seedlings. This further indicated that JA is an intermediate signal to induce baicalin synthesis. The La-induced baicalin synthesis was blocked by JA synthesis inhibitors, which strongly suggested that JA was involved in the LaCl3 signal transduction that induced baicalin synthesis, in other words, baicalin synthesis was induced at least partially via a JA signal transduction pathway. Although the JA synthesis was suppressed by SHAM in the presence of LaCl3, baicalin production was significantly higher than in the control, implying that JA was not the only signal molecule for inducing baicalin synthesis. LaCl3 may have induced baicalin synthesis through other signal transduction pathways when JA signal transduction was impaired in S. baicalensis seedlings.
