TCDD may provoke a broad range of toxic effect, both in humans and in animals, including chloracne, hepatotoxicity, thymic atrophy, reproductive toxicity, teratogenesis, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has been classified TCDD as carcinogen since 1997. In addition, dioxin has the potential to disrupt multiple endocrine pathways and to provoke immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to infectious agents (Mandal 2005; Fiorito et al. 2017a). Indeed, it has been described that dioxin decreases host resistance to several viruses, both in vivo and in vitro. In particular, dioxin enhances mortality in mice infected respectively with herpes simplex II virus (Clark et al. 1983), human coxsackievirus B3 (Funseth and Ilb\u00e4ck 1994; Funseth et al. 2000, 2002), and with different subtypes of influenza A viruses (House et al. 1990; Burleson et al. 1996; Warren et al. 2000; Vorderstrasse et al. 2003). Furthermore, TCDD increases virus replication in cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (in MT-4 or U1cells) (Pokrovsky et al. 1991; Gollapudi et al. 1996) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (in MRC-5 cells) (Murayama et al. 2002).",

An extraordinary plan of official control was carried out to monitor dioxins levels in cow\u2019s and buffalo\u2019s milk from farms in Campania region, and the geo-referencing analysis allowed to individuate a restricted area of the region where was located the majority of the non-compliant farms (Esposito et al. 2009, 2010). To verify the possibilities of the use of data obtained in vitro to in vivo conditions, we performed an epidemiological analysis on the distribution of virus in the above monitored farms. We collected serum and plasma samples to detect antibodies for IBR from cattle raised on those farms, by using IBR-gB and IBR-gE E.L.I.S.A. kit, which represents the test procedure of choice in many European IBR programs. And we found a significant prevalence of IBR on samples collected from farms in contaminated areas, compared to samples collected in uncontaminated areas (Fiorito et al. 2015).",

Cells were maintained in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C (in 5% CO2/95% air). This cell line was maintained free of mycoplasma and of bovine viral diarrhoea virus by real time PCR analysis (Cordero Camacho et al. 2011). The BoHV-1 Cooper strain was used throughout the study. Virus stocks were routinely grown on MDBK cells and were also used for determination of virus titers (Fiorito et al. 2008a, 2013). We used 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 10 \u03bcg/mL in toluene (Supelco, 48,599). TCDD was initially diluted to give a 10,000 pg/mL stock solution by mixing with DMEM. This stock solution was then diluted to give working solutions of 0.01, 1 and 100 pg/mL in DMEM (from 3,1 \u00d7 10\u2212 14 to 3,1 \u00d7 10\u2212 10 M), which were added to cultures, according to Fiorito et al. (2008a,b,2010, 2011, 2013, 2014a, 2014b, Santamaria et al. 2011). In preliminary studies, we treated control cells (MDBK) with a toluene/DMEM mix at the same concentrations used to dilute the TCDD stock solution in toluene at working solutions of 0.01, 1 and 100 pg/mL in DMEM. In our experimental model, no significant differences were detected in cell viability, as well as in cellular morphological features between MDBK treated with DMEM or toluene in DMEM at 0.01, 1 and 100 pg/mL (data not shown). All other chemicals were of the highest commercially available purity.",

Herein, we only showed the results at 12 h p.i., in the presence of the medium dose of TCDD (1 pg/mL). The cytoskeletal actin in control cells, at all times, was arranged in many thin and short fibers surrounding the nucleus and, from circular filaments, fibers diverge radially as spokes toward the cell cortex, like a net of concentric fibers, as previously demonstrated (Wulf et al. 1979). Both actin fibers and cortical actin remained unaffected in, exposed or not, infected cells until 4 h p.i.; starting from 8 h to the end of infection, a complete reorganization of the actin based cytoskeleton it has been occurred (data not shown). In particular, at 12 h p.i. in TCDD uninfected group, in a shape similar to control, only an enhancement of radial fibers was detected (Fig. 3), according with previous data showing that dioxin did not alter actin filaments in human uterine RL95-2 cells (McGarry et al. 2002). In infected group, more stress fibers were arranged in spherical structures and cortical actin increased (Fig. 3). Moreover, filopodia were intercellular networks (Fig. 3). At the same time, in the presence of TCDD, a similar pattern of actin was detected in BoHV-1 infected cells, which loosed spherical shape and appeared polyhedral (Fig. 3). Cortical actin accumulated, thin stress fibers were shorter, were arranged in a confused manner and did not reach the cell periphery, in contrast to those observed at 4 h p.i. (data not shown).",

Our previous studies (Fiorito et al. 2008b, 2014a) indicate that TCDD in infected cells accelerates BoHV-1 induced apoptosis. The sirtuin protein family has also been proposed to be involved in cellular stress response pathways including DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Saunders and Verdin 2007). SIRT3 is located in the mitochondria, dynamic organelles that play crucial roles in intracellular signaling and apoptosis (Verdin et al. 2010). Herein, following infection in MDBK cells, we detected an increase of SIRT3 both in transcript and in protein levels (Fig. 2). Moreover, SIRT3 had a similar trend previously observed in canine coronavirus type II-induced apoptosis (Marf\u00e8 et al. 2011). In particular at 12 h p.i. when, in the same experimental conditions, in the presence of TCDD, BoHV-1 induced apoptosis occurred (Fiorito et al. 2008b, 2014a), we detected a significantly increase in SIRT3 at all doses studied (Fig. 3).",

(Fig. 3) increased until the end of infection. While, in all infected groups, TCDD drastically and significantly modified cytoskeletal organization starting from 12 h p.i. (Fig. 3) when, in the same experimental conditions, accelerated virus-induced apoptosis occurred (Fiorito et al. 2008b, 2014a), to the end of infection. In addition, caspase-3 induces, by inactivating PARP, cytoskeletal reorganization (Elmore 2007; Green et al. 2014) and TCDD induced the cleavage of PARP earlier than control groups during the early stages of infection (Fiorito et al. 2008b, 2014a). As reported above, viruses have developed several types of interactions with host cells to produce viral replication, persistence and spread. The actin cytoskeleton is involved in many crucial cellular processes, including providing cell integrity, mobility and shape, driving cell division and contraction, and the uptake of extracellular molecules. We already described morphological changes, such as rounding and loosening from basic structures, in MDBK during BoHV-1 infection, in the presence or not of TCDD, by Acridine Orange staining (Fiorito et al. 2008b), Giemsa staining (Fiorito et al. 2010), or by ample syncytia formation along with elimination of the cellular sheets, as in CPE (Fiorito et al. 2008a). In general, changes in cell shape are related to alterations in the architecture of the cellular cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton is also implicated in herpesvirus capsid assembly and nuclear egress. Later stages of the herpesvirus replication cycle have been associated with disassembly of actin stress fibers, retraction and rounding of the cells and the formation of actin-containing cell projections (Favoreel et al. 2007). Herein, we evidenced that BoHV-1 infection of MDBK cells provokes a disassembly of cytoskeletal actin, modified by TCDD. Concomitantly, we detected a significant increase in virus replication (Fig. 4). Indeed, following infection in MDBK cells, in BoHV-1 infected groups, at MOI of 5, exposed to different concentrations of TCDD, we detected an increase of virus titer which significantly increased at the end of infection (Fig. 4a), as we previously showed at MOI of 0.1 as well as at MOI of 1 (Fiorito et al. 2008a, 2013). On the basis of the overall results obtained by investigating the effects of BoHV-1 infection and TCDD exposure, alone or in combination, we can state that the main factor that influences virus replication is represented by dioxin.",

After 12 h p.i., fixed cells were stained with Phalloidin, Fluorescein Isothiocyanate labeled and then observed under fluorescent microscope (magnification, \u00d71000). In TCDD uninfected group, similarly to control, an enhancement of fibers which diverge radially was detected. In infected group, more stress fibers were arranged in spherical structures and cortical actin increased and filopodia were intercellular networks. In the presence of TCDD, a similar pattern of actin was detected in infected cells, which loosed spherical shape and appeared polyhedral. Cortical actin accumulated, thin stress fibers were shorter, were arranged in a confused manner and did not reach the cell periphery",
