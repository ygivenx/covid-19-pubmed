On the basis of previous evidence that camels carry the virus, a team led by Huachen Zhu and Yi Guan at the University of Hong Kong\u2013Shenzhen Branch in China looked for MERS-CoV and related viruses in 1,309 dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia. One in four camels tested positive for human coronavirus genetic material, and nearly 20% carried a MERS-CoV strain. Some animals carried the lineage that caused a South Korean outbreak this year. Further genome sequencing suggested that this lineage emerged in camels between December 2013 and June 2014, after two viruses recombined.",
