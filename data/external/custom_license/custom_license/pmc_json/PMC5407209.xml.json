He was initially diagnosed with pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2011 in El Salvador. In November 2011, he received induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and 1 cycle of intrathecal methotrexate, followed by 5 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy with bendamustine, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil between December 2011 and May 2012. A bone marrow biopsy in May 2012 showed recurrent disease, prompting treatment with 3 cycles of high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone. A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed morphologic complete remission. After that, he received continuous maintenance therapy with methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, and monthly intrathecal methotrexate. He presented to the NIH in February 2013 for a human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling HSCT. The patient gave informed consent under an institutional review board-approved protocol (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; 12-H-0028). He received myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and 1200 cGy total body irradiation (lungs shielded to 600 cGy), a CD3 and CD19 depleted graft, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine followed by full engraftment. The immediate posttransplant course was complicated by an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile colitis, and respiratory syncytial virus infection. He developed grade 1 acute GvHD of the skin, a brief episode of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia without end-organ disease, and a parainfluenza upper respiratory tract infection. He received continued prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and acyclovir. Antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole was discontinued 2 weeks posttransplant secondary to elevated liver enzymes. He had a follow-up visit at NIH in October 2013; he was asymptomatic and had 100% donor chimerism in CD3 and myeloid cells. In January 2014, while in El Salvador, he developed nonbloody diarrhea and was treated empirically by his local physicians with a 2-week course of prednisone with resolution of the diarrhea. When he was seen at NIH in March 2014 for routine follow up, he was asymptomatic and denied fevers, chills, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary symptoms, or rash. Aside from the aforementioned resolved diarrheal episode, he did not have other events in the previous months. His only medications were prophylactic TMP-SMX and acyclovir.",

In endemic areas, the majority of infections are asymptomatic. There is a wide spectrum of clinical illness, ranging from acute and chronic pulmonary infections to disseminated histoplasmosis. The incidence of histoplasmosis after HSCT is unknown but is believed to be rare. Vail et al [7] retrospectively reviewed 137 patients who received an allogeneic HSCT from 1994 to 1996 in an endemic area and found no cases of histoplasmosis with a mean follow up of 16.1 months. Assi et al [8] retrospectively reviewed 111 cases of systemic histoplasmosis at the Mayo Clinic from 1991 to 2005 and identified only 1 case in an autologous HSCT recipient. Most recently, Kauffman et al [9] prospectively enrolled solid organ transplant (SOT) and HSCT recipients diagnosed with endemic mycoses from March 2001 to September 2005. Of 16200 HSCT recipients, 3 cases of histoplasmosis were identified (0.02%). In contrast, 23 cases of histoplasmosis were identified from 16806 SOT recipients (0.14%) over the same time period.",

            "text": "Our review of the literature suggests that histoplasmosis is rare post-allogeneic HSCT. However, because the diagnosis of histoplasmosis is challenging and empiric or preemptive antifungal treatment is often administered post-HSCT, it is likely that the incidence of histoplasmosis is underestimated in the HSCT population. Therefore, the use of PET imaging and molecular diagnostics, as shown in this case, may lead to recognition of additional cases of histoplasmosis and reassessment of its incidence in allogeneic HSCT recipients.",

(A) A chest computed tomography in March 2014, 1 year post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, revealed a 1.6 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2.1 cm right upper lobe lung lesion, associated with surrounding ground-glass opacity. (C) A positron-emission tomography (PET) scan showed a hypermetabolic right upper lung nodule with activity of 4.4 maximum (max) standardized uptake value (SUV). Focal hypermetabolism was also noted in the right hilum associated with mildly hypermetabolic mediastinal nodes, including in the subcarina, where the activity measured 3.6 max SUV. (B and D) In April 2015, approximately 1 year after the prior scan, and after completion of a 12-week course of voriconazole treatment, a repeat chest computed tomography showed a decrease in the size of the right upper lobe nodule, which measured 1.4 cm in its longest dimension (B), and was negative by PET examination (D). Hematoxylin and eosin stains of the biopsy of the lung nodule showed areas of necrosis (E) and chronic inflammation (E and F). Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver stain revealed numerous yeast cells with narrow budding (G), which were negative by mucicarmine stain (H). Magnification, \u00d720 (E); \u00d7200 (F and H); \u00d7400 (G). Scale bars, 1000 \u03bcm (E); 100 \u03bcm (F and H); 10 \u03bcm (G).",
