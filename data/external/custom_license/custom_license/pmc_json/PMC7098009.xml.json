The first pandemic of the twenty-first century was caused by a new combination of bird, pig and human viruses that spread quickly from person to person. Eighty per cent of the victims were under 65 years and 30 per cent had no underlying health risk factors (Dawood et al., 2012). This was a big difference from the regular or seasonal flu, which affects mainly the elderly and those with weak health.",

Some of the dramatic media stories focused on young, healthy people succumbing to the H1N1 virus (CBS 60 Minutes, 2009). Others reviewed the history of influenza pandemics from the previous century. In 1918, the Spanish flu epidemic caused by an H1N1 strain resulted in 4 million deaths during a four-week period (Ahmed et al., 2007). In 1976, following a swine flu infection in Fort Dix, New Jersey, the first mass influenza virus vaccination was developed. The mass vaccination program that followed exposed a serious side effect called Guillain-Barre syndrome, an acute disorder that can cause paralysis and death (Wang and Palese, 2009). All of these reports elevated public concerns about the serious threat of the 2009 H1N1 virus and the safety of the vaccine developed to prevent its spread.",

Concerns of the US public were well-documented in several published national polls. A limited amount of vaccine was available between July-October 2009, so only about half the US public said they expected to receive the vaccine, while a higher percentage said they expected to get their children vaccinated. In making their decision, some people appeared to make a trade-off between the perceived risk of the virus and the perceived risk of the vaccine (ABC News/Washington Post Poll, 2009). The proportion of the US public that was concerned with getting sick from the H1N1 virus dropped from about 60 per cent in October 2009 to about 40 per cent in December 2009. By December 2009 the vaccine had become more widely available, yet only 14 per cent of US adults had been vaccinated (Steelfisher et al., 2010), a low uptake of concern to health officials.",

Sixty per cent of the fatalities occurred in Southeast Asia and Africa, home to 38 per cent of the world\u2019s population (Naik, 2012).

First, health policy-makers need to know what factors affect individuals\u2019 decisions to get a new minimally tested vaccine against a deadly contagious disease. As a follow-up, healthcare marketers can help design a communications approach to encourage adoption of the vaccine and minimize the number of deaths in future pandemics. Providing timely, accurate information about the seriousness of the threat and the availability of a safe, effective vaccine through appropriate information channels could motivate individuals to get vaccinated and stay healthy during future pandemics.",

To this end, we developed and tested two alternative models on the role of mass media and personal information sources on the attitude towards the disease and the intention to get vaccinated. In this study, we collected survey data from 321 adults in a large western US city during November 2009 by mall and street intercepts. We analyzed their beliefs, attitudes and intentions with regard to adoption of the H1N1 vaccine. Based on empirical testing of these models, the contribution of this paper is to draw implications on how mass media and personal information sources could be better utilized to counter future pandemics.",

Another survey of 387 students at higher education institutions in Israel in December 2009 (Teitler-Regev et al., 2011) found that the factors positively affecting the intention to take the swine flu vaccine were past experience with the seasonal flu vaccine, higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the illness, perceived seriousness of illness and lower levels of barriers. However, in both these studies, there was no attempt to investigate the impact of information sources on risk perceptions or compliance.",

The intention to act is, in turn, influenced by attitudes towards performing that behavior, which is, in turn, influenced by beliefs (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975). The health belief model (HBM), in this tradition, posits that the likelihood of an individual engaging in a preventive healthcare action, like getting vaccinated, is a function of the degree of threat from disease perceived by the person and a benefits-to-cost analysis of the preventive actions (Janz and Becker, 1984). Risker (1996) explicitly introduced information sources into the HBM. Individual differences (e.g. demographics), cues to action (e.g. mass media and personal sources of information) and past behavior affect the perceived threat from disease (attitude), which in turn affects the intention to get vaccinated. Such HBMs have received empirical support in the literature (Jayanti and Burns, 1998).",

Analyzing a systematic random sample of 180 newspaper articles between 1994 and 1998, Moynihan et al. (2009) found that news media are an important source of information about new medical treatments, but there was concern that some of the coverage was inaccurate and overly enthusiastic. A Hong Kong study of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic found that people were more likely to comply with health-related recommendations if they believed the government was providing clear and sufficient information and could be trusted to control the spread of infection (Tang and Wong, 2004). Thus, credibility of the mass media and government has been established as an important factor in attitudes towards new drugs and patients\u2019 intentions to adopt them. Existing research has established that medical professionals such as doctors have higher source credibility on health information than mass media television, newspapers or Internet Web sites (Worsley, 1989; Freed et al., 2011).",

Media effects research recognizes differences in credibility between personal and mass media information sources and their corresponding impacts on attitudes, intentions and behavior (e.g. Lee et al., 2007). In the diffusion of innovation literature, Rogers (1962) categorized segments of a population as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards based on their timing of adoption of innovations. Katz and Lazarsfeld (1955) proposed a two-step flow of communication, where mass media information sources first affect the attitudes of opinion leaders, who then use personal influence (word-of-mouth) to change the beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behavior of the rest of the population. Integrating these two research streams, Robertson (1967) suggested that mass media advertising was more effective in influencing the innovators and early adopters, while personal word-of-mouth information was more effective in influencing the early majority, late majority and laggards.",

A simple, two-page survey questionnaire was designed and administered in person to adults in two shopping malls and three different neighborhoods of a large, West Coast US city (Appendix). Qualified respondents were adults who either lived or worked in the city. Over 10 days in November 2009, 330 responses were collected, of which 321 were usable. Although a convenience sample, demographics of the sample matched demographics of the city published by the US Census quite well in terms of gender and ethnicity (Table I). Because respondent time availability limits the amount of information that can be collected in an in-person survey, variables were mostly single-item Likert scales. Attitude (perceived threat from disease) was operationalized by, \u201cOn a scale of 1-10 how concerned are you about getting H1N1/Swine Flu?\u201d (Appendix Q8). Past behavior was captured by, \u201cDid you take the flu shot last year? (Yes/No)\u201d (Appendix Q4). We used three demographic variables: age (18-29, 30-44, 45-54, 55-64 and 65+), gender (male/female) and number of children at home (Appendix Q2). The cost-benefit trade-off was captured by, \u201cOn a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in the safety of the H1N1 vaccine?\u201d (Appendix Q9). Intention to get vaccinated was operationalized by, \u201cAre you planning to take the H1N1 vaccine? (Yes/Maybe/No)\u201d (Appendix Q6). Respondents were provided a list of information sources and asked, \u201cWhat is your current source of information about the H1N1 virus and the vaccine?\u201d (they could select multiple sources \u2013 Appendix Q10). For any selected source, they were asked to rate the level of trust they had in that source on a five-point Likert scale (1 = low trust, 5 = high trust) (Appendix Q10). Information sources were categorized into mass media (government, news media and non-news Internet) and personal sources (doctor, school, work and friends/family). For each of these two categories, a credibility index was created for each respondent by adding the weighted level of trust across the selected information sources. These indices reflected respondents\u2019 credibility in mass media and personal information sources. We use the mean-centered values of the indices in the model estimation.",

Credibility of mass media sources has a strong positive impact on perceived threat from disease (Column 1) but a weak positive impact on intention (Column 3). However, credibility of personal information sources has a strong positive impact on both perceived threat of disease (Column 1) and intention (Column 3). In fact, the credibility of personal information sources has a stronger positive impact on intention to get vaccinated (Column 3) than on perceived threat (Column 1). The pseudo R-square for the intention equation in Column 3 (0.160) is higher than in Column 2 (0.125). We also conducted a likelihood ratio test between the two ordered logit models in Columns 2 and 3.

Including a broader conceptualization and operationalization of the cost-benefit trade-off in the HBM would be highly desirable in future research. Another limitation is that different segments may respond to information sources differently. For example, mass media sources may be more effective among mature consumers (Moschis and Friend, 2008).
