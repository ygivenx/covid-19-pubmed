Will a virus become more or less virulent in a new host? What level of virulence is optimized by natural selection and why? Is there any consistent association between host-jumping and virulence such that predictions can be made about how virulence might evolve following emergence? Not only will the answers to these questions reveal fundamental aspects of virus biology, but they also may assist in infectious disease management and mitigation, particularly as humans, other animals and plants face a continual threat from emerging viruses.",

To be as general as possible, we assume a simple working definition of virulence: the harm caused by pathogen infection, particularly in terms of host morbidity and mortality. Virulence is also a complex trait determined by a combination of pathogen, host and environmental factors. Although it is obviously necessary to understand all three, we focus on the pathogen (virus) component as this is the most tractable, with the small genomes and rapid replication and evolution of viruses facilitating comparative and experimental studies, and because there is strong evidence for heritable virus genetic variation for virulence2. Although we purposely focus on the analysis of virus genomes, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) promise to open up new ways to explore the evolutionary impact of viral infections on host genomes3 and hence the intimate interaction between host and virus4.",

Determining which microorganism is the cause of a particular disease syndrome can be troublesome, and it is possible that overt illness might result from synergistic interactions between multiple microorganisms that overwhelm the host. Hence, the model of one pathogen\u2013one disease that has dominated studies of human infections, and implicitly models of virulence evolution, may be overly simplistic. It is also possible that measurements of relative virulence vary between humans and wildlife populations. For example, whereas dengue is considered an important infectious disease of humans, the virulence of dengue virus is low in terms of overall mortality in humans, and infections of equivalent severity may go unnoticed in wildlife, particularly as there is a strong sampling bias towards the most virulent presentations.",

These studies are often very successful in pinpointing causal mutations (see Table 1 for illustrative examples) and are commonplace following the emergence of a new disease. However, because the mutations identified through experimental studies are not considered in an evolutionary context, their relevance for general theories of virulence evolution is usually ignored. In addition, in vitro methods may not reflect real-world selection pressures, there may be little consideration about how virulence mutations affect inter-host transmission, and animal models commonly differ from the species infected in the field. For example, virulence determinants in MYXV identified on the basis of in vitro studies and mouse models have often not been upheld in reverse genetic experiments using the natural rabbit host17. Similarly, despite the regularity of their use, there has been a long-standing debate over the validity of ferrets as accurate models for human influenza18.",

In this Review, we outline how this can be achieved within a phylogenomics framework. We show that virus phylogenies are being increasingly used to help identify virulence determinants and that the data obtained can be used to test general theories of virulence evolution. Such a phylogenomic approach to studying virulence evolution is timely because of the rapidity with which virus genome sequence data are now being generated, including during ongoing disease outbreaks of emerging viruses19\u201321, and because of the development of new phylogeny-based methods for studying and visualizing genomic data22\u201324. However, the success of this approach also requires that phylogenomic data are combined with relevant clinical, epidemiological and experimental metadata so that a direct link can be made between virulence, virus genotype and phenotype, and population fitness.",

Because there is a very large literature base on this subject, we necessarily provide only a brief overview here. A straightforward interpretation of virulence evolution is that natural selection will optimize the level of virulence that maximizes pathogen fitness, expressed as the basic reproductive number (R0)1, although in reality fitness is shaped by a complex set of host\u2013pathogen interactions38,39. Current evolutionary theory tells us that when a virus jumps to a new species, its initial virulence can vary from asymptomatic to highly pathogenic, and precisely where it lies on this virulence spectrum is difficult to predict. However, it is possible that the direction of virulence evolution can be anticipated, at least in part, if the key relationship between virulence and transmissibility, and hence fitness, is understood. Importantly, there is also evidence from insect viruses that host phylogeny is able to predict some aspects of virulence evolution following species jumps, with related host species tending to have similar levels of virulence25.",

In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to \u2018intermediate\u2019 virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before inter-host transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates. A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence40. However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model35,41\u201343, virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility39,41,44, contrary results have been observed in experimental studies45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature. For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia \u2014 rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) \u2014 there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable46. Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation47 and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence was shown to provide the Plasmodium parasites with a competitive advantage within hosts48.",

Phylogenomic analysis revealed that a single Thr249Pro (T249P) amino acid substitution in the virus NS3 helicase protein was associated with high-virulence WNV outbreaks in corvids on multiple continents. Experimental analysis in captive crows then showed that this mutation was sufficient to explain the high fatality rates in American crows, perhaps because it increased the rate of virus replication58. WNV therefore provides an important example of where a single genetic switch controls virulence, which is obviously the easiest scenario to detect using a phylogenomic approach. Of more general importance was that T249P evolved in parallel and experienced an elevated rate of nonsynonymous change, suggesting that high virulence was selectively favoured in the absence of an evolutionary trade-off as no reciprocal mutations were observed elsewhere in the viral genome58. However, because WNV infects a variety of bird species, it is possible that the repeated appearance of T249P in fact reflects aspects of viral evolution in different hosts. In particular, American robins may have been responsible for a substantial proportion for the cross-continent spread of the virus74, in which case T249P may have been selected to increase replication (transmissibility) in that species, a coincidental by-product of which was heightened virulence in crows.",

In both Australia and Europe, highly virulent strains of MYXV were used as a biological control against the European rabbit population, with releases beginning in the early 1950s. In both continents, the same trajectory of virulence evolution was observed: virulence declined from the highly virulent (that is, grade I) release strains to encompass a far wider range of virulence grades, including the most attenuated grade V strains, with strains of \u2018intermediate\u2019 virulence the most commonly sampled in the field. This pattern, reflecting a combination of the virus evolving more attenuated strains and the host developing resistance, fuelled the idea of a trade-off between virulence and transmissibility.",

However, a major surprise was that each change in virulence was associated with a different set of mutations across multiple genes94,95. Although which mutations had the greatest impact on virulence is still unclear and requires further experimental analysis, such a phylogenomic pattern indicates that there are multiple routes to achieving the same levels of virulence, including attenuation, such that there has been convergent evolution for phenotype but not genotype. It is likely that this evolutionary flexibility in part reflects the fairly large genome size of MYXV (a double-stranded DNA virus of ~160,000 bp), which may mean that there is a large number of potential virulence determinants that can interact through epistasis96, in turn complicating any phylogenomic analysis.",

Although still contentious, particularly in the case of human disease, there is good evidence that imperfect vaccination has increased virulence in the case of MDV, a DNA herpesvirus that poses a major problem to the poultry industry99. In the 1960s, the appearance of virulent MDV strains forced the development of the first generation of Marek\u2019s disease vaccines. However, because these vaccines were imperfect, \u2018very virulent\u2019 MDV began to appear within 10 years, necessitating a second-generation vaccine. This very virulent MDV was followed, more rapidly, by the appearance of \u2018very virulent plus\u2019 MDV, requiring a third-generation vaccine (Fig. 3). Imperfect MDV vaccines enhance virulence by elongating the infectious periods and hence transmission potential of virulent strains that would have been removed by natural selection before transmission in the absence of vaccination99. Although the genomic basis to MDV virulence evolution is currently uncertain, with some causative amino acid changes proposed100, initial phylogenomic studies suggest that, as in the case of MYXV, there are multiple genetic pathways to high virulence101 (and which again may reflect the fairly large size of the viral genome). Not only does virulence evolution in MDV have important implications for vaccination strategies against other diseases in which vaccine efficacy is fairly low102, but it also shows that in some circumstances increased virulence can be selectively advantageous.",

In support is evidence that SPVL, and hence virulence, has declined in some African HIV subtypes, even accounting for the use of antiviral therapy, and that this reflects a trade-off between virulence and transmissibility114. Importantly, however, despite many studies into the determinants of HIV virulence, the virus genomic mutations responsible for determining SPVL are still uncertain and multiple genes may be involved104.

A82V is notable as it falls on a deep internal branch of the EBOV phylogeny, compatible with adaptive evolution, whereas other amino acid changes are associated with individual or only small clusters of sequences. Moreover, A82V improves binding to the human NPC1 receptor utilized by EBOV117, which would increase infectivity in humans, at the same time reducing infectivity in cells from the bat reservoir species70,116. Intriguingly, the appearance of A82V on the EBOV phylogeny is associated with two key epidemiological features: an increase in case numbers and an increase in mortality (Fig. 4). If there was indeed an increase in both EBOV transmissibility and virulence, then higher virulence is likely to have directly increased viral fitness, and in the absence of an evolutionary trade-off as only a single substitution was identified. However, these apparent changes in phenotype also coincided with the movement of the virus from Guinea to Sierra Leone, such that any change in case numbers and mortality could in fact be due to a change in epidemiological factors (such as access to health care or differing human demographics and/or transmission networks), and recent studies using animal models suggest that A82V has no direct impact on virulence118.",

            "text": "ZIKV is the most recent emerging virus to lead to a major public health scare and is puzzling because a seemingly benign virus suddenly increased in virulence, causing severe neurological disease in humans. Before 2007, there were fewer than 20 human cases of ZIKV reported and all were mild infections restricted to Africa and Asia9,119. Consequently, neither the disease caused by ZIKV nor the molecular determinants of ZIKV virulence were well characterized, and it is likely that there was systematic under-reporting of infections, including those associated with severe disease. In 2007, the Pacific Islands reported the first major outbreaks of ZIKV before the virus spread to the Americas in 2014. Although the majority of human infections range from asymptomatic to mild, the virus was associated with the neurological Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome in French Polynesia in 2013 (ref.120), and those cases from the Americas, particularly Brazil, were linked to more severe diseases, including congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly121. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the most recent Zika epidemics are due to the Asian lineage of ZIKV, rather than the African lineage122, and that the virus spread cryptically in Brazil for at least a year before its detection20. Although there are multiple amino acid differences between the African and Asian lineages122,123, it has been claimed that those in the Asian lineage that spread through the Americas may be directly linked to both increased infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes124 and microcephaly, most notably a Ser139Asn (S139N) amino acid change in the PrM protein125. However, there is still considerable uncertainty in this area, with others arguing that viruses from both lineages can cause neurovirulence but that cases often go unreported9,126. Hence, the case of ZIKV highlights the difficulty in assessing virulence evolution within a background of sparse and biased sampling even with phylogenomic data and shows the importance of collecting reliable, real-time epidemiological data even in low-incidence situations.",

Although a strong body of theory has been developed, there are few cases in which we understand the forces that have shaped particular instances of virulence evolution and even fewer in which we have successfully linked evolutionary theory with individual genomic changes. We believe that a synthesis of experimental studies of virulence determinants and long-standing theory of virulence evolution set within a phylogenomic framework will generate a more comprehensive understanding of virulence evolution. In particular, not only does a phylogenomic approach enable potential virulence determinants to be identified, which is being increasingly used in the case of emerging viruses, but this analysis also sheds light on the models of virulence evolution that have occupied theoreticians for decades.",

We contend that this can be achieved within a phylogenomic framework as long as relevant data are available and strong links are made between genomics, phylogenetics, epidemiology, and experimental studies of virus virulence and fitness. Therefore, it is critically important to collect clinical (that is, disease symptoms and severity) and epidemiological (that is, time and place of sampling) metadata concurrently with the sequencing of virus genomes and to sample across a range of clinical syndromes, not just those associated with severe disease. We also stress the value of gathering concurrent and historical data from likely reservoir species as these will provide a more complete insight into virulence evolution and determining the full range of microorganisms that infect a particular species, as well as their interactions, as assigning disease syndromes to individual pathogens may often be difficult. Thankfully, advances in metagenomics now make the latter task feasible6,7,129. Similarly, there is a marked lack of good virulence grading schemes among viral infections. Although such schemes can sometimes be simplistic, assuming discrete virulence categories that may not exist in nature and incorporating degrees of subjectivity, the case of MYXV shows that they are key to considering the relationship between genotype and phenotype that is essential to understanding virulence evolution.",

Once again, biocontrol presents a compelling example. Although controversial131\u2013133, the proposed release of cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) as a biological control against invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) in Australia may present a unique opportunity to follow, in real time, the co-evolution between host and virus at both the genotypic and phenotypic scales.
