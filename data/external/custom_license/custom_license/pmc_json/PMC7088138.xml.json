            "text": "The Apicomplexa protozoan parasite genus Cryptosporidium is comprised of over 20 species to date (Fayer 2004). Transmission of Cryptosporidium is most often by the fecal\u2013oral route via contaminated water, food, or fomites or by direct ingestion of infected feces. In cattle, Cryptosporidium bovis, Cryptosporidium andersoni, and Cryptosporidium parvum are species of particular importance. Among these three species, C. bovis and C. andersoni are prevalent in post-weaned and adult cattle, respectively, and are not important zoonoses (Fayer et al. 2007). In contrast, C. parvum is an important zoonosis, is the most pathogenic species in cattle, and is prevalent in pre-weaned calves (Fayer et al. 2007; Lindsay et al. 2000; Robinson et al. 2006; Trotz-Williams et al. 2006; Santin et al. 2004). C. parvum infects many mammals and is globally recognized as a significant cause of diarrhea in people and cattle (Feltus et al. 2006; Xiao and Feng 2008). Cryptosporidium hominis, which is host adapted to humans, is also an important cause of diarrhea in people and was the cause of the largest water-borne disease outbreak ever recorded, impacting approximately 403,000 citizens of Milwaukee, WI, USA in 1993 (Chappell et al. 2006; MacKenzie et al. 1995; Morgan-Ryan et al. 2002).",

            "text": "Cryptosporidiosis is the clinical syndrome of fever, diarrhea, and large volumes of fluid loss from the gastrointestinal tract (DuPont et al. 1995; Fayer 2004). The severity of this diarrhea and its subsequent dehydration influence morbidity and mortality in people and animals (Anderson 1998; O\u2019Handley et al. 1999). Treatment of the illness poses a challenge as there is not a consistently effective chemotherapeutic agent for use in animals or in people (Amadi et al. 2002; Anderson and Curran 2007; Graczyk et al. 2011; Harp and Goff 1998; Mead 2002). For example, nitazoxanide has shown efficacy in immune-competent but not immune-compromised children (Amadi et al. 2002). In experimentally infected dairy calves, treatment with nitazoxanide reduces the duration of fecal oocyst shedding and improves clinical signs; however, there are no animal-labeled formulations at this time (Ollivett et al. 2009). Animal-labeled formulations of halofuginone are available. While halofuginone has been shown to improve clinical signs by delaying the onset of diarrhea and reducing fecal oocyst shedding, it does not prevent diarrhea and fecal shedding entirely (Jarvie et al. 2005).",

Infection and disease most commonly occur in calves between 1 and 4 weeks of age and usually last for approximately 2 weeks (de Graaf et al. 1999; O\u2019Handley et al. 1999; Xiao and Herd 1994). In young animals, during the first few days of natural infection, large numbers of oocysts may be shed in the feces. For example, a naturally infected 6-day-old calf that sheds oocysts for 6 days may produce in excess of 3 \u00d7 1010 oocysts (Nydam et al. 2001). Excreted oocysts are readily infective and can survive for several weeks to months in the environment and likely cause infection when calves are born into contaminated maternity pens or placed in contaminated housing (Anderson 1998). Therefore, the extent of calf exposure to infective oocysts may be associated with the degree of environmental contamination. There is currently little published information on this relationship in calves, nor is there literature describing the pattern of fecal oocyst shedding over time as it relates to the magnitude of exposure.",

This randomized, double-blinded study was performed at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University (Ithaca, NY, USA) from June 2007 to August 2010. Forty three calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm and enrolled in the study as they were born. Control calves (n = 7) were enrolled concurrently with test calves (n = 36). At least one study author attended all calvings. The perineum of the dam was thoroughly cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub, and calves were caught on single-use plastic sheets to prevent on-farm manure contamination. Immediately after birth, a physical examination was performed, and an identification tag was placed in the right ear. All calves were fed 2\u20134 l of maternal colostrum or \u2265100 g IgG per dose commercial colostrum replacer (Bovine IgG, Colostrum Replacement, Land O\u2019 Lakes Inc.) within the first 4 h of life.

The \u00d720 objective on a fluorescent compound binocular microscope (460\u2013490 wavelength fluorescent compound binocular microscope Olympus BX41, Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA) was used to count the number of oocysts observed. The number of oocysts observed in 10.5 \u03bcl was then multiplied by 10,000 to give the number of oocysts per gram of feces. This count was standardized by the dry weight percentage. Dry weight analysis of fecal samples was obtained by taking a 10- to 20-g portion of each original fecal sample, drying it at 108 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h (Thermolyne Mechanical Oven, Barnstead International, Dubuque, IA, USA), then weighing it directly (Precision Standard Scale, Ohaus Corporation, Pine Brook, NJ, USA) (Bellosa et al. 2011).",

It causes severe illness in people, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among calves, and can result in economic losses for dairy farms (Mor and Tzipori 2008; Waltner-Toews et al. 1986; Warnick et al. 1995). In the absence of a commercially available vaccine and consistently effective prophylaxis, the best means by which cryptosporidiosis can be controlled is through preventive measures. Previous studies in people and in calves in field settings suggest that smaller magnitudes of oral exposure reduce the duration of fecal oocyst shedding and may, in turn, reduce environmental loading, and thus reduce subsequent opportunities for exposure to the parasite (DuPont et al. 1995; Moore et al. 2003).",

We found a difference in the onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding, and in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight across four magnitudes of exposure, but we did not find a difference in the duration of fecal oocyst shedding. In contrast to our study, the study conducted by Moore et al. did find a significant difference in duration of fecal shedding with respect to size of inoculum in dairy calves (Moore et al. 2003). However, in that study, 75 calves were enrolled, and 29 calves died after day 3 of life. Among the eight that were necropsied, Salmonella spp, rotavirus, and coronavirus were recovered in addition to C. parvum. It is, therefore, possible that many of the calves enrolled in that study experienced a longer duration of shedding due to altered immune function associated with co-infection. In our study, all calves survived through to completion of the study. All calves were tested for infection with Salmonella spp, as well as for rotavirus and coronavirus infection, and all were negative, whereby eliminating enteric co-infection as a confounder. In addition to the study by Moore et al., another study conducted by DuPont et al. looking at the infectivity of C. parvum in people suggests that the size of oral inoculum not only influences the duration of fecal shedding but also influences the onset of fecal shedding (DuPont et al. 1995). However, people in this study with base-line antibody to the parasite experienced more severe clinical illness, which the authors attribute to increased susceptibility. This may have potentially confounded the onset and duration of fecal shedding. Both of these studies included oral inoculums that were less 1 \u00d7 103 oocysts in magnitude, whereas ours did not. Therefore, it is possible that the onset, cessation, and duration of fecal shedding are more appreciably impacted at lower dose magnitudes. It is also possible that the sample size for our study was not large enough to detect this difference.",

Efforts were made to minimize extreme variability in parasite level effects by using the same field strain of oocysts that were at least 87 % viable. Likewise, efforts were also made to minimize extreme variability in calf level effects by enrolling calves from the same commercial dairy and ensuring adequate passive transfer of antibodies. These differences are best explained by normal variation in many factors acting in concert with one another including effects attributable to variations in calves, the parasite, and the environment. It should also be noted that among the three calves that did not shed and the two calves that shed earliest and latest in the study, all received a dose of 1 \u00d7 103 oocysts, which was the lowest dose magnitude we tested. It is conceivable that this was not a large enough infectious dose for the three calves that never shed, and the one calf that did not start to shed until day 12 post-challenge. Given the low infectious dose reported in people, it stands to reason that factors other than magnitude of infectious dose influenced fecal shedding for these calves (DuPont et al. 1995). These results indicate that the degree of fecal shedding of oocysts is influenced by multiple factors including dose magnitude, parasite lifecycle, parasite level effects, and calf level effects. It is also possible that different results might be attained with the use of a different strain, but without testing, we cannot be sure.",

Calves that receive a lower oral dose begin shedding later and shed fewer total oocysts. This study also demonstrated that calves shed numbers of oocysts that greatly exceed the magnitude of the dose administered, which is partially attributable to the auto-infective stage of the parasite lifecycle in which sporozoites re-infect the epithelial cells of the intestinal lumen and thus initiate a new cycle of parasite development. While it was not evaluated in this study, it is possible that the auto-infective stage of the parasite life cycle may cause a delay in the onset of fecal shedding at lower infectious doses. Infected calves, in turn, void readily infective resistant oocysts into the surrounding environment. Given the heartiness of the parasite, the potential for large-scale contamination of the local environment and the low infectious dose, disease prevention remains to be the best control measure for cryptosporidiosis.",

Therefore, if onset of fecal oocyst shedding was delayed, environmental parasite loading could be reduced, as well as the risk of exposure for calves and people. Differences in fecal shedding varied across doses and between doses, indicating important effects at both the calf level and parasite level. Preventing calf exposure to the parasite entirely is not realistic in conventional calf-rearing systems where the pathogen is often endemic and therefore not an adequate means of disease prevention alone. Instead, an integrated approach to the prevention of cryptosporidiosis in calves should be undertaken in order to address parasite, calf, and environmental factors through the provision of clean and dry housing and an appropriate plane of nutrition. Future studies will be focused on the impact of delayed fecal shedding and reduced dose magnitudes on fecal oocyst shedding, as well as on delineating the dose\u2013response relationship and determining the ID50 for fecal shedding in dairy calves.",
