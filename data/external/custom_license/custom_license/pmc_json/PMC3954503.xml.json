            "text": "One potentially attractive\ntarget for pharmacological interference\nin the HIV-1 life cycle is the virus\u2019 requirement for a programmed\n\u22121 ribosomal frameshift (\u22121 PRF) in order to express\nits enzymes.6 Ribosomal frameshifting is\na recoding mechanism common among viruses with polycistronic (multiple\nopen reading frames, or ORFs, in a single gene) genomes. It allows\nviruses to translate polypeptides in different ORFs by avoiding the\nstop codon(s) present in the single mRNA transcript. In HIV-1, the pol gene is in the \u22121 reading frame with respect\nto gag. Gag, the precusor of the viral structural\nproteins, is produced via normal translational rules, while Pol, the\nprecursor of the viral enzymes, is synthesized as a fused Gag-Pol polyprotein via \u22121 PRF. This occurs with a frequency\nof 5\u201310% of ribosomes translating the full-length viral mRNA.\nA critical molar ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag protein is required for HIV-1\nreplication and infectivity; alterations to this ratio have been shown\nto be detrimental.7 \u22121 PRF in HIV-1\nis controlled by two cis acting mRNA elements: a\nheptameric slippery sequence (U UUU UUA), with the 0 frame indicated\nby spaces and where the frameshift actually occurs, and a downstream\ntwo-stem helix immediately following the slippery sequence, also known\nas the frameshift stimulatory signal (HIV-1 FSS, Figure 1).8 While several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to account for the frameshift,9 it is currently hypothesized that this event results from an incomplete\ntranslocation for a limited number of ribosomes, due to resistance\nof the FSS to unwinding.10\u221212 These ribosomes then start translation\nof pol in the new \u22121 reading frame. Modification\nof the slippery site or stimulatory sequence (either via natural variation\nor laboratory mutations) in ways affecting frameshifting efficiency\ntranslates to a decrease in viral replication.13,14 These and other results have led several groups to propose \u22121\nPRF as a potential target for developing antiretroviral agents for\nHIV-1.6,15\u221217",

Increases in reverse transcriptase (RT) following treatment with\n1.5 mM RG501 were also observed, as would be\nexpected for an increase in Gag-Pol production. Recently, the Butcher\ngroup confirmed that this compound indeed binds the HIV-1 FSS RNA\nwith weak affinity (KD \u223c 360 \u03bcM),\nand they carried out NMR structure analysis, indicating that RG501 binds in the major groove of the upper stem-loop.29 Unfortunately, as noted by the authors, RG501 is a relatively nonselective binder and interacts\nwith other RNAs. It stimulates frameshifting in viruses with different\nFSS,29 and likely that also interacts with\nthe ribosome.6RG501 is also toxic,27 a likely result of its\nlack of selectivity. Moreover, its interference with HIV replication\nbegins at concentrations below those observed to affect frameshifting.27,24 Other compounds such as guanidinoneomycin,30 idarubicin, and doxorubicin31 have been\nshown to bind the HIV-1 FSS. Doxorubicin was found to bind with a KD of 2.8 \u03bcM, decreased frameshifting in\na rabbit reticulocyte assay, and also significantly reduced overall\ntranslation. A screen of an Arg-rich peptide library revealed a sequence\nable to significantly reduce frameshifting, but this displayed no\nselectivity for the HIV-1 FSS relative to other frameshift-stimulating\nconstructs and likely also interacts with the ribosome.32 Thus, as far as we are aware, there are no reported\nexamples of synthetic molecules able to alter HIV-1 frameshifting\nand interfere with viral infectivity via selective, high-affinity\nbinding to the FSS RNA.",

An intriguing observation from our initial screen36 was the finding that a symmetrical compound\nwas selected, despite the target RNA being nonsymmetrical. This work\nconfirms that both putative intercalators are required for high-affinity\nbinding, as compounds 7 and 8 had only weak affinity for the FSS.\nStructural analysis will be essential to fully understand the binding\nmode of 4 and 5, but the recognition of a nonsymmetrical RNA\nbinding site by a symmetrical, dimeric molecule is not unprecedented;\nfor example, Arya and colleagues have described the use of neomycin\ndimers for recognition of HIV TAR RNA,50 and the Hergenrother group designed deoxystreptamine dimers that\nbound nonsymmetrical RNA loops.51 Likewise,\nstructural information should prove useful for understanding the significantly\nhigher selectivity of 4 for FSS\nRNA over FSS DNA and tRNA relative to 5.",

Relative to previously studied compounds\ntargeting frameshifting in HIV, compounds 4 and 5 produce a roughly\nequivalent increase in RT at a 37.5-fold lower concentration than RG501. As such, compounds 4 and 5 represent promising\nleads for further study, as well as interesting tools to further investigate\nthe mechanism of \u22121 PRF. Since the pseudotyped HIV used in\nthis assay is only capable of one round of replication, we anticipate\nthat stronger effects will be observed with wild-type HIV in a spreading\ninfection assay. Of course, further enhancements in affinity and selectivity\nwould likely improve activity as well. As discussed above, previous\nhigh-throughput screening efforts targeting frameshift-modulating\ncompounds in which bicistronic reporters provided the assay readout\nlargely yielded compounds acting on the ribosome. Given this observation,\nit has been suggested by others that assays focused on direct binding\nto the FSS RNA could be advantageous, as such compounds could potentially\nincrease frameshifting by inhibiting unwinding of the upper stem-loop.6 The results presented herein support this hypothesis.\nIn the context of HIV biology, our results with compounds 4 and 5 indicate that an increase in frameshifting and a concomitant\nincrease in the Gag-Pol/Gag ratio decreases viral fitness. This is\nconsistent with the work of Mak and colleagues, who increased the\nGag-Pol/Gag ratio via cotransfection.52",
