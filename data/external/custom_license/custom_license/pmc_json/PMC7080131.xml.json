As you see, two kinds of regimens which could increase the risk of PCP development are included: rituximab and prednisolone. In addition, this risk could be more increased by the administration of several cycles of R-CHOP regimens, because cytoreduction might progress and the duration of corticosteroid usage will be lengthened in consequence of repeated chemotherapy. Indeed, a previous report showed that anti-lymphocyte count (ALC) decreased according to the number of cycles of R-CHOP therapy [9, 10]. Based on these rationales, it can be readily inferred that PCP might develop often in patients with NHL who are treated with R-CHOP and incidence of PCP could increase according to repeated cycles of R-CHOP.",

Secondly, we searched for patients who received anti-pneumocystis regimens at therapeutic dose. Among them, those who had following conditions were considered as having probable PCP : 1) symptoms such as fever, cough, or dyspnea, 2) radiologic findings compatible to PCP, 3) no other definite cause of pneumonia.

Using ALC as a surrogate indicator of the CD4 count may not be appropriate in this setting, particularly because CD8 cell count is known to recover faster than CD4 count [22].

This suggests that it is not too late to start anti-pneumocystis therapy after the symptoms of PCP manifest, as long as the patients are cautiously observed. Lastly, one of the important side effects of TMP/SMX used for anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis is bone marrow suppression [25]. This crucial side effect can disturb the normal course of NHL therapy.
