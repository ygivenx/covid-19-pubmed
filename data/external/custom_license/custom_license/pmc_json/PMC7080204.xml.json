The virus is readily transmissible and the resulting disease clinically severe, with approximately 20% of cases requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, almost always as a consequence of respiratory failure [5]. Although no new cases have been reported since 8 September 2003 (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_09_24/en/; accessed 15 October 2003), the transmissible nature of the disease and the high proportion of patients who require ICU admission means a recurrence of the epidemic may again result in a large number of critically ill patients with SARS. In order to be better prepared to both care for these patients and to carry out further research, it is useful to know the clinical course and outcome of the disease amongst those who require ICU and to know the factors which are associated with prognosis.",

The target tidal volume was 4\u20136 ml/kg predicted body weight during controlled ventilation, but this was allowed to rise during the weaning phase. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set by titrating PEEP against oxygenation and compliance. In pressure-control mode the compliance was assessed from the measured tidal volume. In volume-control mode the compliance was assessed by measuring the plateau pressure. In pressure-regulated volume control it was assessed from the driving pressure required to achieve the set tidal volume. Inspired oxygen concentration was titrated to achieve an arterial saturation of 88\u201394%. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was avoided because of the potential risk of increased viral transmission resulting from mask leakage and high gas flow.",

Briefly, it consisted of broad-spectrum antibiotics, ribavirin and low-dose corticosteroids. Except in the initial phase of the epidemic, patients who deteriorated despite this treatment were given additional methylprednisolone in 500 mg pulses up to a total of 3 g. As the epidemic progressed, this maximum dose was increased to up to 5 g and in addition some patients were given convalescent serum donated by patients who had recovered from SARS and/or IgM-enriched immunoglobulin. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered at the time of institution of high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy. In the absence of clinical sepsis in the first 3\u20135 days following high-dose steroid therapy, antibiotics were withdrawn. Suspected infection was treated early with empirical broad spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, anti-fungal agents. Antibiotics were modified according to bacterial culture of sputum, tracheal aspirate and blood.

It is made up of six component scores (respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, hepatic, renal and haematological) each of which is scored from 0\u20134, giving a maximum possible score of 24. The median maximal MOD score in our patients was only 5, of which the median respiratory component was 3, indicating that SARS causes predominantly respiratory failure with little in the way of other organ failure. The large number of patients who required vasopressors or inotropes probably reflects our tendency to use these drugs instead of fluids to treat hypotension in patients with SARS. The severity of the respiratory failure is reflected by the fact that 47 of the 54 patients met criteria for ARDS at some stage in their ICU stay and the mean admission PaO2/FIO2 ratio on admission to the ICU was only 152 mmHg. The incidence of barotrauma (25.9%) was high compared with the 7\u201311% previously reported for ARDS [17, 12, 18]. Again, the Toronto and Singapore series show similar results with a 34 and 23% incidence of barotrauma despite the fact that in all three series the clinicians used low-volume, low-pressure strategies. Unfortunately, we did not record plateau pressures; however, the plateau pressure cannot exceed the peak airway pressure and the mean peak airway pressure prior to the development of an air leak was only 26.5 cm H2O. This suggests that the high incidence of air leaks was not due to excessive inflation pressures. Similarly, the mean tidal volume prior to development of an air leak was 6.79 ml/kg predicted body weight, which is similar to the values achieved in the low tidal volume group of the ARDSnet study [12]. This high incidence of adverse effects suggests that it may be preferable to avoid mechanical ventilation unless it is absolutely essential.",

It is likely that there was considerable confounding amongst these factors and that some of these factors would not be found to be independently associated with outcome on multivariate analysis. For example, both age and chronic disease are components of the APACHE II score [14] and both APACHE II and admission MOD score reflect severity of illness [15, 14]. In addition, the delay between symptom onset and admission to ICU is likely to reflect severity of illness with more severely ill patients deteriorating more rapidly and requiring earlier ICU admission. Unfortunately, the large number of potential prognostic factors and the relatively small size of our cohort prevented meaningful multivariate analysis [19]. Nevertheless, we believe the results of our analysis may be useful in generating hypotheses. At this stage of our knowledge of this new condition it is almost inevitable that observational studies will raise as many questions as they answer. They do, however, provide data that will help in the design of subsequent observational and interventional studies.",

Instead, we found that patients with a good outcome received a higher average daily dose of steroids.

These data are in keeping with data suggesting that a restrictive fluid regime may be associated with better outcomes in ARDS [20]. It is, however, possible that the positive fluid balance in our patients with a poor outcome was due to the confounding effect of nosocomial sepsis. More patients in the poor-outcome group had nosocomial sepsis and patients with nosocomial sepsis are likely to receive more fluid due to the capillary leak and vasodilatation that characterizes systemic sepsis.",

If the change in lymphocyte count is found to be independently associated with outcome in these patients, this parameter may be a marker of disease activity.
