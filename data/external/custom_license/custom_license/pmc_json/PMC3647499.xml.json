A large deletion had removed the tcdA and tcdC genes and a portion of the adjacent cdd1 gene located outside the PaLoc. Strain AI35 also encoded a variant TcdE. The AI35 binary toxin locus was complete and contained an intact copy of cdtR, unlike ribotype 078 isolates, which encode a cdtR with a premature stop codon. Strain AI35 may therefore be a more proficient binary toxin producer than ribotype 078 strains. Despite these variations, multilocus sequence typing showed that strain AI35 belongs to the same clade (clade 5) and sequence type (11) as ribotype 078 strains [strain AI15 in the report by Stabler et al.

AI35-mediated cytopathic effect on Vero cells was similar to that reported for the lethal toxin of C. sordellii and C. difficile strain 8864, a toxin A\u2013B+ human strain with mutations affecting its glucosylation substrate specificity (14). Strain M7404 (ribotype 027) was significantly more virulent than strain AI35 (p = 0.0001 by log-rank [Mantel Cox] test) and strain JGS6133 (p = 0.0002 by log-rank [Mantel Cox] test). All mice infected with strain M7404 died (Figure 2, panel A), but mice infected with strains AI35 and JGS6133 survived (Figure 2, panel A). Still, despite low toxin production, AI35 caused significantly greater weight loss in mice than did the ribotype 078 strain JGS6133 (p = 0.0011 by analysis of variance) (Figure 2, panel B). This difference may be the result of production of a variant toxin; similar toxins were 8-fold more toxic to mice than was toxin B produced by strain VPI10463 (15).",
