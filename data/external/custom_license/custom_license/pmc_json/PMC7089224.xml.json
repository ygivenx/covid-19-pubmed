            "text": "The AIDS pandemic arose from a previously unrecognized virus that was apparently transmitted to humans from chimpanzees early during the twentieth century, spread in central Africa during the mid-twentieth century and then spread globally during the 1970s (Holmes 2001; Rambaut et al. 2001; Worobey et al. 2008). This global spread occurred at a time when medical dogma suggested that outbreaks of infectious diseases in wealthy countries were largely of historical importance rather than major threats. The AIDS experience made evident the fallacy of this dogma and raised concerns that human populations would suffer other lethal pandemics from zoonotic pathogens (i.e., pathogens transmitted to humans from nonhuman hosts). This concern grew during the late 1980s and 1990s as the global scope of AIDS unfolded and epidemiologists recorded other examples of newly recognized lethal zoonotic diseases. Overviews of such \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d (e.g., Morse 1993; Garrett 1994) and fictional dramatizations (e.g., Preston 1994) have heightened this concern broadly across the health sciences and the general public over the past 15 years.",

The critical characteristics addressed are virulence (defined as the harm caused by the infectious agent), transmissibility (the tendency for infectious agents to be transmitted from infected hosts to susceptible individuals), and chronicity (the tendency of an infectious disease to have a prolonged course after the acute phase of infection). Emerging infectious diseases are defined broadly to encompass (1) diseases caused by pathogens that have recently entered human populations from other host species, (2) diseases that are expanding from one human population into another, and (3) infectious diseases that are generating new characteristics (such as antibiotic resistance) as a result of the evolution of their etiologic agents. In this paper I evaluate how evolutionary principles can provide insights into the threat posed by these categories of disease, but also emphasize that discussions of future threats from infectious diseases need to include a fourth category: diseases that are newly recognized as being caused by infection. This fourth category reflects emerging recognition of the spectrum of infectious causation and is often not included within the topic of emerging infectious diseases. All four categories, however, deal with the future threat posed by infectious diseases. Limitations on intellectual and economic resources require that investments in research and control efforts for any one of these categories be evaluated relative to investments in each of the others.",

These characteristics need to be considered in concert because they are highly interdependent. A high degree of disease severity, for example, may often reduce transmissibility because severe illness may reduce the ability of infected individuals to contact susceptible individuals (Ewald 1994). But high virulence may also enhance control efforts because severe diseases are conspicuous, and chains of transmission are easier to recognize and halt when infections are conspicuous during their early acute phase.",

Pathogens transmitted by biting terrestrial arthropods (i.e., vector-borne pathogens) do not require host mobility for transmission and are more severe than directly transmitted pathogens (Ewald 1983, 1994). Waterborne transmission of diarrheal pathogens also does not require mobility of infected hosts. Attendants remove feces and fecally contaminated materials, and transport them to cleaning or disposal areas that directly or indirectly contaminate water sources. Accordingly, the per infection mortality of pathogens is positively correlated with the degree to which diarrheal pathogens are waterborne (Ewald 1991a). Pathogens that are durable in the external environment (termed \u201csit-and-wait\u201d pathogens) are less dependent on mobile hosts for transmission than pathogens that lose viability quickly after release from infected hosts (Ewald 1994). Accordingly, the mortality of untreated human respiratory tract infections is positively correlated with the durability of their etiological agents (Walther and Ewald 2004). Many hospital-acquired infections similarly do not rely on the mobility of infected hosts, because they are transmitted by hospital attendants. Theory predicts that such pathogens will evolve to increased virulence in response to such attendant-borne transmission. Outbreaks of Escherichia coli in neonatal wards accords with this prediction (Ewald 1991b).\n",

Accordingly, and in contrast with the pathogens in the categories described above, sexually transmitted infections tend to be benign during the initial acute phases: mortality per untreated infection is far <1% for every sexually transmitted pathogen of humans. Manifestations in adults are generally restricted to lesions or discharges. Sexually transmitted pathogens of humans are, however, often lethal over the entire course of infection, because sexually transmitted pathogens cause persistent infections that may cause lethal damage long after the end of the acute phase.",

Few people in human societies change sexual partners at a rate that would allow for much sexual transmission during the acute phase. Success at sexual transmission is greatly fostered by persistence within humans for months or years. Accordingly, sexually transmitted pathogens have evolved mechanisms for avoiding destruction by immune responses. Once pathogens have evolved the ability to persist, however, they may eventually cause severe damage to the tissues they infect even though the pathogens are benign during the acute phase of infection. Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), for example, has evolved mechanisms for stimulating its host cells (helper T cells) to divide indefinitely, while exposing few viral antigens to the immune system. HTLV-1 infections are essentially asymptomatic during the first few weeks of infection and remains so for decades in most individuals. But they eventually causes lethal cancer in approximately 1\u20137% of infected individuals (Arisawa et al. 2009).",

An emerging pathogen that is transmitted by any of these modes could pose a grave threat where social and environmental conditions permit transmission. But where human activities prohibit transmission from sick individuals this threat is ameliorated (Table 2). Malaria, for example, is one of the most damaging infectious diseases of humans, but it poses little threat where housing tends to be mosquito-proof\u2014about 1,300 imported cases of malaria were reported in the United States in 2003, but only 10 infections were acquired within the US (Eliades et al. 2005). The main reason for this lack of vulnerability appears to be an infrastructure that strongly reduces the potential for mosquito-borne transmission. The effect of mosquito-proof housing was experimentally demonstrated by a campaign that virtually eradicated malaria from an area in which the prevalence had been about 40% (Fig. 1). The inability of dengue virus to spread in the US similarly appears to be due to mosquito-proof infrastructure (Reiter et al. 2003).\n\n",

The literature on emerging diseases has suggested, for example, that global warming could facilitate the spread of vectors and diseases they transmit (Epstein 2000; Khasnis and Nettleman 2005). A case in point is dengue. Specialists on vector-borne diseases worried that the spread of Aedes mosquitoes in the US would cause the spread of dengue from Mexico throughout much of the southern US. But studies north of the Texas/Mexico border have documented the inability of dengue to spread in Texas even in the presence of an abundant vector population (CDC 1996; Reiter et al. 2003). The most reasonable explanation is that infrastructural barriers to mosquito-borne transmission, such as air-conditioned cars and buildings, prevent sustained transmission of dengue on the Texas side of the border (Reiter et al. 2003).",

West Nile virus, for example, attracted much attention in the US during 2000 and 2001. This virus is not, however, transmitted from human to mosquito. Its threat is therefore limited to spillover from avian hosts that maintain it in a region. One might argue that evolution of transmission from person to mosquito could transform West Nile virus into a major threat in countries with mosquito-proof dwellings. But the evidence from malaria and dengue suggests otherwise. Even if a mutation allowed some transmission from human to mosquito, this toehold has little chance of leading to sustained transmission from mosquito to human when infrastructures block sustained mosquito-borne transmission of pathogens that are well adapted to transmission from humans to mosquitoes. The Plasmodium agents of human malaria and dengue virus, for example, have highly evolved abilities for transmission from human to mosquito; yet they could not maintain themselves in the US, even though Plasmodium once did, and the yellow fever virus, a relative of the dengue virus, once spread epidemically in the US. A mosquito-borne virus, such as the West Nile virus, must have a much lower potential for epidemic spread and persistence because it is not adapted to transmission from humans to mosquito.",

The threat could also materialize when infrastructural changes increase the mosquito density, as occurred in sub-Saharan Africa when dams were built. The resulting stagnant water increases mosquito density and may exacerbate outbreaks of vector-borne pathogens, including those that are not well adapted for transmission from human to mosquito, such as Rift Valley fever virus (Wilson 1994; Lautze et al. 2007). The threat could similarly materialize into damaging epidemics of diarrheal diseases when pathogens enter areas without protection of water supplies, as has occurred broadly over the past half century with the El Tor biotype of Vibrio cholerae (Ewald 1994).",

Over the past decade the respiratory tract pathogen that has elicited the greatest attention is the influenza virus. Influenza causes concern because influenza epidemics are difficult to control and an influenza pandemic in 1918 caused massive global mortality. The recognition in 1997 that the H5N1 avian influenza virus could be transmitted directly to humans and cause a high case fatality led to widespread concern that this virus might be on the verge of causing a pandemic that was as bad as or worse than the 1918 pandemic. The emergence of H1N1 influenza from swine into humans in early 2009 and the subsequent global spread has led to a related concern. During the first month of the outbreak, deaths per case appeared to be about an order of magnitude greater than that associated with seasonal influenza. After a few months, as the epidemic became pandemic, the deaths per infection were comparable to seasonal influenza. This mortality has persisted to the time of this writing. Experts in emerging diseases point to the second wave of increased virulence that occurred during the 1918 pandemic and suggest that the new H1N1 virus could similarly develop a hypervirulent second wave during the 2009\u20132010 influenza season. Consideration of past influenza epidemics, particularly the 1918 pandemic, in light of the trade-offs associated with virulence, host mobility, and transmission, provides perspective.",

Using deaths per infection as a gauge, the influenza viruses that caused the second wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic were more lethal than typical influenza by one to two orders of magnitude. Emerging disease experts tend to presume that this unusual mortality was bad luck associated with the randomness of mutations, recombinations, and zoonotic transmission to humans. They also tend to presume that this bad luck could happen again, especially when a zoonotic influenza virus is readily transmissible from human to human, which is only a possibility for the H5N1 viruses but is a fact for the new H1N1 viruses. The implicit and sometimes explicit argument is that pathogens that are poorly adapted to humans can be severe in humans, and if such a severe pathogen by chance has the ability to be transmitted from human to human, it could cause a terrible pandemic. Advocates of this hypothesis point to a zoonotic origin of the 1918 virus, suggesting that it may have not been well adapted to humans (e.g., Gorman et al. 1991).\n",

It therefore emphasizes the need to investigate whether the high virulence of the 1918 pandemic resulted from natural selection acting under unusual environmental circumstances. This line of reasoning led to consideration of the conditions in the Western Front of the first world war (Ewald 1991b). Those conditions allowed individuals immobilized by illness to be transported repeatedly from one cluster of susceptible hosts to another, in trenches, tents, hospitals, and trains (Ewald 1991b, 1994). This line of argument extends the definition of attendant-borne transmission to include not only transport of the pathogens by attendants, but also transport of the infected host into contact with susceptible hosts. As is the case with the other examples of attendant-borne transmission (Table 1), the more exploitative and hence more virulent variants of the influenza virus would be favored by this transport of infected hosts, because the virulent variants would obtain the competitive benefits of exploitation of a person without paying the price of reduced transmission that would normally be associated with immobilization of the infected person.",

The next best evidence comes from past and future epidemics. Outbreaks of unusually high lethality occur occasionally, but in all cases the harmful strains are replaced by strains of normal virulence within several months. For example, an outbreak of influenza with a reported mortality per case of 2.5% (roughly comparable to that of the virulent phase of the 1918 pandemic) occurred in Madagascar in 2002, but this outbreak waned after about 30,000 cases (WHO-GOARN Investigation Team 2002; Centers for Disease Control 2002). In Liverpool, UK, high death rates were attributable to a mortality per case that was elevated by about threefold (Viboud et al. 2006). Subsequent spread in the UK, Canada, and the US was associated with a decline in mortality to normal levels within a few months (Viboud et al. 2006).

The evolutionary considerations presented above predict that influenza viruses will not cause another pandemic of the severity experienced in the fall of 1918, unless the extremely unusual conditions that permit extensive, regional transmission of influenza viruses from immobile hosts once again occur. This prediction was first published in 1991 (Ewald 1991b), even though influenza experts were suggesting then and have been suggesting ever since that a new highly lethal flu pandemic might be imminent. Over the past 2 decades, the prediction has been borne out in spite of expert opinions to the contrary, particularly with regard to the outbreak of H5N1. Within the next year the new H1N1 pandemic will provide another test. The evolutionary theory outlined here predicts that there will not be a second wave of hypervirulent HIN1 during the 2009\u20132010 influenza season, in contrast with the 1918\u20131919 influenza season and the concerns of some influenza experts.",

Soon after this theory was applied to influenza, it was pointed out that rearing operations for chickens often offer great potential for continual transmission from severely ill individuals, much like the potential that occurred in 1918 at the Western Front (Ewald 1994). Evolutionary considerations therefore predicted recurring chicken epidemics associated with a lethality comparable to that 1918 pandemic. Such severe epidemics have in fact recurred repeatedly in chicken-rearing facilities over the past 15 years (Table 5). A variety of influenza types have been responsible these outbreaks. The recurring epidemics are therefore not simply due to resurgences of one particularly virulent type of avian influenza virus. Rather, the pattern is better explained by a potential for lethal epidemics that is generally present among influenza variants when environmental circumstances allow transmission from very sick hosts. This pattern emphasizes the importance of natural selection acting on variation generated by processes such as mutation and reassortment rather than some predisposition to virulence that is intrinsic to any particular variant.\n",

When opportunities for vector-borne, waterborne, sit-and-wait transmission, or attendantborne transmission are feasible, emerging diseases transmitted by these routes may pose grave threats. Where environmental infrastructure broadly restricts these routes, even pathogens that are well adapted to humans tend to be unable to maintain themselves by these routes. This restriction of transmission routes generally correlates with economic prosperity; the threat of diseases spread by these routes tends to be great in poor countries, but slight or moderate in wealthy countries (rows 1\u20133 of Table 2). If an emerging pathogen is moderately transmissible (e.g., SARS virus), then interventions that reduce this transmission below the break-even point (in the terminology of epidemiological mathematical models, reducing R0 below 1) are sufficient to prevent emergence, but most of the emerging diseases that have been emphasized are not transmissible or only slightly transmissible from humans (Table 7). Such pathogens pose little threat, because they can spread in humans only if they evolve higher transmissibility. For some modes of transmission (e.g., waterborne and vector-borne), this hurdle will be virtually insurmountable because it is too high even for pathogens that are well adapted for transmission by these modes; the lack of malarial transmission in countries with mosquito-proof housing, for example, argues against the possibility that less human-adapted mosquito-borne pathogens such as West Nile virus could be stably transmitted in a human/mosquito cycle in such countries.",

In contrast to the diseases that have attracted most attention in the emerging disease literature, hepatitis C has been and continues to be a major cause of global mortality. In the US, for example, it causes about 9,000 deaths per year from liver cancer and liver cirrhosis, about the same as the number of deaths caused by AIDS. Influenza causes roughly comparable numbers of deaths in the US, though the actual numbers are difficult to estimate: about 2,000 influenza deaths are reported annually and estimates suggest that influenza may contribute to about 35,000 influenza deaths annually. The emergent swine H1N1 is similar to seasonal influenza in transmissibility and lethality, and will therefore probably cause death at a rate that is comparable to seasonal influenza. Of all the emerging acute diseases that have been discovered and discussed since the onset of the AIDS pandemic, the emerging H1N1 virus is the only one that has had an effect that would put it into the same threat category as hepatitis C. This is a sobering comparison, because little attention has been given to hepatitis C relative to emerging diseases such as SARS, Ebola, West Nile, and H5N1 influenza.",

The proportion of human cancer that is accepted as caused by infection has increased from less than about 1% of all cancers at the onset of the AIDS pandemic to about 20% today (zur Hausen 2006; Ewald 2009; Table 8). The leading cancers worldwide (Table 9) are either known to be or suspected to be caused at least in part by pathogens. Even lung cancer, for which tobacco smoke is a widely accepted cause, may arise in part through a contribution from infection (Abdel-Aziz et al. 2007; Zheng et al. 2007). Because infection-induced cancers can be prevented by preventing the causal infection, the growing recognition of infectious causation of cancer since the onset of the AIDS pandemic offers a much greater potential for saving lives than the recognition of emerging zoonotic acute infectious diseases during this time.
