Fortunately, full conservation of several key residues that enclose the core binding site in ULPs [14, 18, 19], including the I7L proteinase, suggests the possibility for accurate modeling of the 3D structure of this target site comprising the S2, S1, S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 sub-pockets.

Several studies show that an accurate modeling of PI covalent binding needs to account for the structural changes in the ligand upon reaction with the catalytic residue [22]. This requirement is especially relevant for the I7L active site, enclosed in a tight channel.

The structural model of I7L was subsequently built by placing the aligned residues of the I7L polypeptide chain with ideal covalent geometry onto the corresponding residues of the structural template. Conformations of non-identical side chains and loops shorter that 4 amino acids were predicted using energy-based optimization of the model [24, 25].

To simulate the proper transition state for ketone binding to I7L, a modified \u201ccovalent docking\u201d procedure, similar to the method described in [22] was implemented in this work.

To take full advantage of the core binding pocket and to achieve such selectivity, we suggest synthesis of compounds that combine prime and non-prime moieties of the first generation hits, shown in Table 3. Since binding of prime and non-prime parts of ketones to I7L is virtually independent in most cases due to the fixed position of the ketone\u2013thiol bond, we can expect additive effects on binding energy.
