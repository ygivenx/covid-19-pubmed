Our aim was to measure students\u2019 anticipated negative emotional responses and avoidance activities (dependent variables) to a possible outbreak of EVD (5). We constructed scales for the dependent and independent variables to assess EVD-related perceptions: 1) misconceptions/knowledge about transmission modes, 2) scenarios of an EVD outbreak in Guangzhou (chances, severity, control), 3) efficacy of preventive measures and self-protection, and 4) public stigma toward EVD survivors. MLwiN 2.30 (Centre for Multilevel Modeling, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK) was used for multilevel regression analyses (Technical Appendix).",

To the example of 2\u20133 EVD cases detected in Guangzhou, 31.0% showed >4 types of anticipated negative emotions (e.g., fear, panic, worry); 59.5% showed >3 types of anticipated unnecessary avoidance. Most (80.0%) indicated >1 misconception regarding transmission mode (e.g., believed it was droplet or waterborne) but knew that direct contact with the corpse of an infected person (69.0%) and body fluids (81.4%) could lead to infection and perceived EVD as fatal (85.6%,) and highly infectious (81.6%). About half of respondents believed that effective treatment and a vaccine were unavailable (51.9% and 59.1%, respectively); 22.2% anticipated EVD outbreaks among Africans in Guangzhou (during the next 12 months). Many students perceived severe consequences if a small EVD outbreak occurred in Guangzhou and believed an outbreak would have a high fatality rate (70.5%), EVD is highly infectious (65.4%), an outbreak would be of long duration (47.5%), and the number of infected persons would be high (39.9%); 52.5%\u201379.2% of respondents lacked confidence in the government\u2019s ability to control an outbreak (e.g., ability to provide adequate vaccines, medication, protective gear). Half or more of respondents believed that restricting travel by Africans to and from Africa and avoiding visiting African-inhabited areas were effective means of prevention. About 40% were confident that they could protect themselves or family members from EVD (Technical Appendix Tables 1, 2).",

Confidence in governmental control was negatively associated with both dependent variables. Some variables were positively associated with emotional response but not avoidance (perceived irreversible harm, perceived chance of outbreak in Guangzhou and in other parts in China, perceived self-efficacy for protection); 2 variables (perceived nonavailability of vaccine and knowledge of transmission mode) were positively associated with avoidance measures but not with emotional responses (Table).",
