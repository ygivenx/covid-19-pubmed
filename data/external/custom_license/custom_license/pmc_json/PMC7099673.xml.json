The rapid\ntransmission across country borders and the large number of confirmed cases\nprompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 as a global\npandemic on March 11, 2020. As of March 23, there are at least\n332 930 and 14 510 patients who have been diagnosed with and\nhave died of COVID-19 worldwide, respectively. Among the affected countries,\nChina has the largest population of confirmed cases (81 610) and the\nsecond highest death toll (3276). Meanwhile, Europe and North America have\nalso been hit hard: 59 138 and 31 573 cases were confirmed in\nItaly and the United States, which are the nations with the highest number\nof 2019-nCoV infected patients in their respective continents, with the\nnumber of deaths in Italy (5476) surpassing that of China. Understanding the\nviral infection mechanisms and animal hosts is of high urgency for the\ncontrol and treatment of the 2019-nCoV virus. Whereas it is now commonly\nrecognized that bats such as Rhinolophus affinis may serve\nas the natural reservoir of 2019-nCoV,3 it is still\nunclear which animal served as the intermediate host that brought the bat\ncoronavirus to human hosts. Whereas multiple studies suggest the Malayan\npangolin (Manis javanica) as another\nhost,4\u22126 some studies have proposed that the pangolin may be\na natural host rather than an intermediate host.7,8",

To further\nexamine the animal hosts of the 2019-nCoV spread, we next assembled the\ndraft genome of a highly related coronavirus using metagenomic samples from\nManis javanica.

For\nexample, the top-ranking vertebrates with the lowest RSCU distances to\nthe three different coronaviruses are two kinds of frogs\n(Megophrys feae and Liophryne\nschlaginhaufeni), whereas another frog (Xenopus\nlaevis) has the smallest RSCU distances among all\nvertebrates with sufficient sequences. Part of the reason for the\nfailure of RSCU in intermediate host identification, as shown in\nSupplementary Table S1, is that different\ncoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that are known to\nutilize different intermediate hosts (Paguma larvata\nand Camelus dromedarius, respectively), have almost\nno difference in RSCU (squared RSCU distance = 0.12). These data\nsuggest that the RSCU analysis on its own is not specific enough to\ndiscriminate coronaviruses from different vertebrate hosts. In this\nregard, the failure is not merely due to the use of outdated databases\nor the small number of species included in the original analysis but\nis, in fact, caused by the incorrect biological assumption that\ncoronaviruses will evolve their RSCU to resemble that of their\nhosts.",

These samples were\nconverted to paired-end sequencing reads in FASTQ format by\nfaster-dump. A quality check by FastQC version 0.11.9 showed that\nwhereas the 4 samples from PRJNA476660 do not contain adaptor\nsequences, all 21 samples from PRJNA573298 contain Illumina universal\nadaptors. Therefore, for these 21 samples, Trimmomatic version\n0.3940 was used to remove adaptor sequences\nusing the flag\n\u201cILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fa:2:30:10:2:keepBothReads LEADING:3\nTRAILING:3 MINLEN:36\u201d. To remove contaminations from the host\nand from human researchers, only read pairs that could be mapped to\nManis javanica or Homo sapiens\ngenomes by bowtie41 version 2.3.5.1 were retained\nfor further analysis. These sequences were converted from SAM format\nof bowtie2 back to FASTQ format by SAMtools42\nversion 1.10 and bedtools43 version 2.29.2.\nFollowing these quality-control processes, we next determined which of\nthe 25 previously mentioned samples include a 2019-nCoV-like sequence\nby two searches at the protein and nucleotide levels. In the\nprotein-level search, the 2019-nCoV spike protein sequence was\nsearched by BLASTp30 through protein sequences\ndirectly assembled from sequencing reads of a metagenome sample by\nPlass, a protein-level metagenome sequence assembler,44 to identify if there were any close hits with an\nE value <0.01. Meanwhile, the\nnucleotide-level search selected samples where more than one pair of\nsequencing reads could be mapped to the 2019-nCoV genome (NCBI\naccession: MN908947.3) by bowtie. Both searches consistently reported\nthat only the lung samples (SRA accessions: SRR10168376, SRR10168377,\nand SRR10168378) contain 2019-nCoV-like sequences. Therefore, the\nsequences were assembled into nucleotide and protein contigs by\nMEGAHIT and Plass, respectively. The assembled nucleotide and protein\nsequences were then aligned by BLASTn and BLASTp to the whole genome\nand the spike protein of 2019-nCoV, respectively, at an\nE-value cutoff of <0.01. Finally, we\nseparately merged all nucleotide and protein alignments into a single\npairwise alignment between 2019-nCoV and the Manis\ncoronavirus (Manis-CoV); when multiple\nManis-CoV hits cover the same 2019-nCoV region,\nthe hit with the highest sequence identity to 2019-nCoV is used in the\nmerged alignment.",

More importantly, the protein sequences assembled\nfrom these Manis lung samples include a partial\npangolin coronavirus spike protein that is 92% identical to the\n2019-nCoV spike protein (Figure 5B).
