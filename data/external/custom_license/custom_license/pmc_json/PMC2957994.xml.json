SARS-CoV emerged in November 2002 and disappeared in April 2004 (28). During these 18 months, it was isolated in many countries, some of which were very distant from each other. However, the total of 8,098 cases of SARS diagnosed worldwide (28) is substantially fewer than the number usually found during epidemics of the most common respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses (18).",

Proportionally fewer children were involved: <5% of all cases were diagnosed in patients <18 years of age (28). The biology of SARS and its low level of transmissibility seem to be the main reasons for the low risk for contagion in children. In most of the areas in which outbreaks occurred, healthcare workers and adult patients were mainly involved and, because they were immediately hospitalized, the risk for the infection spreading to children was greatly reduced because they are not usually allowed to visit hospitals (28). This hypothesis seems to be further supported by the fact that the early detection and isolation of symptomatic patients were the most important measures in controlling the SARS epidemic.",

In particular, the data regarding the earlier-appearing HCoVs indicate that they are distributed throughout the world and mainly circulate during the winter and early spring, with outbreaks occurring every 2\u20134 years (3). Whenever HCoVs have been sought in studies of respiratory infections in infants and children, they have been found, although generally less frequently than other respiratory viruses such as RSV and influenza (18,30). However, the real importance of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in clinical practice has not been fully defined because the collected data are often discordant. In 1974, McIntosh et al. found that the global incidence of LRTIs due to HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 in hospitalized children was no higher than 3.8% (31). Later studies have shown that when all respiratory infections are considered, the etiologic prevalence of these pathogens in pediatric patients can be significantly higher, varying from \u22485% to >30% (7,15).",

The infections caused by these viruses are more common from November through March; more frequently affect children <5 years of age, those examined in the community, and those without underlying risk factors; and are more often identified with serologic methods (32,33). In this regard, 2 recent surveys that used serologic methods alone found previous HCoV-229E infection in 42.9%\u201350.0% of children 6\u201312 months of age (32) and in 65% of those 2.5\u20133.5 years of age (33). Similarly, in 75% of the cases, children 2.5\u20133.5 years of age had antibodies against HCoV-NL63 (33). All these factors can explain why the lowest incidences of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections are usually found when the study population includes older children or adolescents, patients with underlying severe chronic diseases or hospitalized patients, when only highly symptomatic infections are considered, and when the study is conducted during the whole year.",

SARS-CoV is the most aggressive, although the disease seems to be substantially less severe in children than in adults. In patients <12 years of age, the clinical course of SARS was generally milder and shorter than in those >12 years: no death was reported, only 5% of the infected children were admitted to an intensive care unit, and <1% required mechanical ventilation (28). Leung and Chiu found that several children with SARS-CoV infection recovered without any sequelae after receiving supportive therapy alone (36). The only pediatric patients with severe respiratory problems associated with SARS-CoV infection were >12 years (36). The clinical picture in persons <12 years was similar to that caused by other respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses. Moreover, the extrarespiratory manifestations of SARS-CoV infection described in adults (hepatitis and CNS dysfunction) have never been reported in children.",

In most published studies, the incidence of pneumonia or bronchiolitis was <5% (7\u201326,34). Differences in the incidence of LRTIs among studies can at least partially be attributed to the different prevalence of co-infections. Gerna et al. found a high incidence of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63 infections in infants and children with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia, but most of the LRTIs were demonstrated in children co-infected with HCoVs and other respiratory viruses (37). Furthermore, the method used to collect respiratory samples can also play a role in explaining the greater incidence of LRTIs (11,14,16,22). In this regard, it is important to emphasize that when only hospitalized patients (with, consequently, only the most severe cases) are enrolled, the incidence of LRTIs seems greater (34,37).",

In general, all of these viruses (including SARS-CoV) have been confirmed as mainly respiratory viruses with limited clinical relevance in children. They cause mainly URTIs, are not frequently isolated in hospitalized children (7\u201326), and, because they are rarely transmitted to other household members, have a marginal socioeconomic effects on families (18). Even SARS-CoV infection, which had a dramatic effect on adults, was mainly associated with relatively mild disease in almost all patients <12 years of age (28,34). Moreover, most children with a diagnosis of severe respiratory syndrome in whom a HCoV was isolated were co-infected by other respiratory viruses (7\u201326). These finding suggest that the severity of the respiratory disease at least in some of these cases was attributable to the second virus.",

It is now well known that an enormous reservoir of CoVs exists among animals, particularly horseshoe bats, and that CoV isolates recovered from animals in China have up to 99.8% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV (27). Because CoVs can easily mutate, this means that (as in 2003) sustained exposure to the infected animals can lead to a SARS-like CoV strain that is newly adapted to infect humans and capable of causing the reappearance of SARS. Moreover, it has been shown experimentally and in nature that all CoVs undergo a high rate of genetic mutations and can recombine when 2 different strains infect the same cells (1). This finding means that it is theoretically possible that future situations similar to those involving SARS-CoV may involve CoVs that currently infect only some animals, thus leading to novel viruses with unpredictable host ranges and pathogenicity.",
