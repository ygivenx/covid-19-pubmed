Cells were seeded at a density of 7000 cells per well in 96 well view plate TM (Packard, CA) in medium containing the same compounds as described above, except for G418. Cells were allowed to adhere and proliferate for 24 h. At that time, culture was removed and serial dilution of test compounds were added in culture medium lacking G418. Interferon alfa 2a (500 IU) was added as a positive control. Plates were further incubated at 37\u00b0 and 5% CO2 for 72 h replication of HCV replicon in Huh-5 cells results in luciferase activity in the cells. Luciferase activity was measured by adding 50 \u03bcl of 1 \u00d7 Gloysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min of followed by adding 50 \u03bcl Steady-Glo Luciferase assay reagent (promega). Luciferase activity was measured with luminometer and signal in each individual well was expressed as a percentage of the untreated culture. Parallel culture of Huh 5-2 cells, seeded at a density of 7000 cells/well of classical 96-well cell culture plates (Becton-Dicknson) were treated in a similar fashion except that no Glo-lysis buffer or Stady-Glo Luciferase reagent was added.
