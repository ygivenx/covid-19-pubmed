These logic models tend to be challenged when they fail to respond to contemporary problems. Several paradigms of thought have been recognized to be influential in the evolution of public health over the past few centuries. Throughout the 19th century, the major paradigm was that of \u2018miasma\u2019 \u2013 that is, that disease is transmitted through environmental vectors, namely foul emanations including atmosphere, vapour and odour. Miasmist theory was later challenged by the \u2018contagionists\u2019 who believed that disease was spread by organisms passed from person to person. The contagionists purported a single causative agent for any disease (3). As bacteria were discovered, and as infectious diseases and immunization advances predominated the period, it is not surprising that the contagionists\u2019 germ theory was widely adopted as the predominant paradigm of the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.",

Social epidemiological research investigating mortality rates in industrialized societies, such as that performed by McKinley and McKinley (4), has produced interesting results that support that premise. They demonstrated that technical advances and the availability of medical care appear to have had little impact on the decline in mortality apparent in the United States throughout the 20th century (4). In fact, they reported that many of the advanced medical interventions (eg, immunization and infectious disease treatment) occurred only after substantial decline in mortality rates were apparent in many key diseases. They estimated that, at most, 3.5% of the total improvements in mortality rates apparent after 1900 could be ascribed to medical measures. In a different investigation of declining mortality rates in England and Wales (United Kingdom) through that same period, McKeown et al (5) concluded that the phenomenon was due entirely to a reduction in deaths from infectious diseases. They specifically suggested that the main influences over the decline included an improved standard of living and diet, improved hygiene standards, and favourable conditions with respect to human and microorganism interaction.",

It is also clear that, despite great advances in the understanding of microorganisms and disease, the contagionists\u2019 germ theory of one causative agent and one disease does not address the evolving health problems of our contemporary society. As is the case in Canada, since the second half of the 20th century, the health of industrialized world has been heavily burdened by chronic diseases. Out of the need to address evolving challenges, a new paradigm of public health has since evolved. The paradigm of the era of chronic disease epidemiology has focused on identifying and addressing risk factors associated with disease (3). By considering each of the risk factors that underlie chronic disease patterns, as well as the environmental influences, microbial-specific treatments and immunization strategies that have been shown to impact mortality in the face of infectious disease, it stands to reason that an approach to disease management that addresses the range of these factors would be most effective.",

While there was recognition of the importance of these population-wide initiatives to improve Canadians\u2019 health, it was likely the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada in 2003 that truly awoke Canadians to the fact that the traditional, acute care-oriented health care system was insufficient in itself to protect them from all potential health risks (1,11). During this crisis, the risks came unexpectedly, facilitated by the ease of modern global airline travel. A heightened understanding of the influence that ecological and social factors, globalization and a rapidly changing world can have on the health of contemporary Canadians, clarified the need to effectively coordinate efforts to address these. This understanding was a powerful force, which in part lead to the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) (12).",

Among these advances were bulk compressed gas systems, and new patient interfaces for therapeutic gas delivery and mechanical ventilation (14). Within the medical and anesthesia communities, the need for appropriately trained individuals to support these new technologies and therapeutic procedures became obvious (14). During that period, several Canadian hospitals sought to meet this need by introducing hospital-based training programs in inhalation therapy technology (14). It was also during this time that Canada witnessed the establishment of its first hospital inhalation therapy departments (14). Building on these initiatives, the Canadian Society of Inhalation Therapy Technicians (which would later become the Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists [CSRT]) was formally established in 1964 to more universally address and standardize the discipline\u2019s role in addressing changing national health care needs (15).",

In part owing to the demands placed on them by industry and health care organizations, RTs have become actively engaged in health care delivery in nonacute settings such as rehabilitation centres, community care and primary care. However, what is the relevance of public health practice to the profession of respiratory therapy in Canada?",

This is highlighted by several recent examples, including the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. In each of these scenarios, RTs were called on to deliver acute and critical care services to Canadians such as diagnostic testing, respiratory therapeutics and, in severe cases, emergency airway management and mechanical ventilation. These types of services provided to Canadians by RTs, however, do not fully encompass the public health paradigm. Instead, these are examples of the biomedical model of care that focuses on the cause and treatment of health and disease only in terms of biological cause and effect (17). The biomedical model has long been accepted as a predominant paradigm in respiratory therapy, and is strikingly compatible with the germ theory of disease that emanated in the late 19th century, the limitations of which have already been discussed.",

Also, in many health care organizations, RTs are also on the forefront of emergency preparedness planning for events such as impending influenza pandemics. Coordinated efforts such as these, often performed in association with provincial and/or federal public health officials and various community agencies, provide us with examples of the intersectoral and collaborative use of respiratory therapy expertise in real public health practice.",

As the Lalonde and Epp reports have suggested, this approach should include activities that support people\u2019s ability to make healthy choices to cope with health-related issues, and should also create conditions and surroundings that promote health (9). For instance, considering the substantial impact that environmental issues, such as air quality and pollution, have on chronic respiratory disease, finding ways of addressing these should be priorities for RTs (18). The adoption of readily available tools, such as the Air Quality Health Index, into practice is an example of one such opportunity (19). Clarification of the role of the RT within existing public health units should also be explored. To more fully support individuals with chronic and infectious respiratory disease across the full continuum of care, RTs should use such a platform to support and participate in important public health initiatives such as vaccination campaigns.",
