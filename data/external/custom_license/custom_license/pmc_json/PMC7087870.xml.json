Furthermore, accumulated evidence indicates that an inappropriate and persistent immune response is central to the development of both major types of IBD [5\u20138]. An excess of inflammatory stimuli and mediators, and an inadequately low function or number of regulatory components that down-regulate the mucosal immune response can lead to a chronic, progressive inflammatory condition, and eventually to intestinal tissue damage [9, 10].",

Originally described as an immune coagulant with the ability to generate thrombin directly, FGL2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, including viral hepatitis and experimental arthritis [13, 14]. It has recently been demonstrated that FGL2 is an effector molecule on regulatory T cells (Treg cells) [15\u201318]. FGL2 may bind to Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3R), which are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APC), and then inhibits maturation of dendritic cells (DC) and induces apoptosis of B cells, eventually resulting in reduced ability to induce alloreactive T cell proliferation [16, 19]. All these findings collectively indicate FGL2 has potent immunosuppressant properties.",

Under normal conditions, the epithelial barrier continually samples antigen from the lumen and presents it to lymphocytes in the Peyer\u2019s patches to promote tolerance. When it encounters invasion of pathogens, APCs in the mucosa, including macrophages, DC, and intestinal epithelial cells, phagocytose the invading pathogens and present their components to naive CD4+ T cells. The T cells then undergo activation and differentiation to an effector phenotype (i.e., Th1, Th2, or Th17) or a regulatory phenotype (i.e., Th3 or Treg) [9]. While effector T-helper cells mount specific immune responses by expression of unique cytokines to combat the invading pathogens, Treg cells suppress inflammation and restore homeostasis to the mucosal tissues by expression of regulatory cytokines, for example interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b2).",

Although the exact nature of this defect has not been identified, mounting evidence indicates that IBD occurs in the presence of dubious antigens, most likely normal resident luminal bacterial and/or food-derived, which initiate a dysregulated immune response within the intestinal mucosa and the eventual development of chronic intestinal inflammation [8]. Furthermore, there has been sustained interest in the importance of Treg cells in IBD. It seems that fewer circulating Treg cells are present in patients with active IBD, but insufficiently increased in the intestinal mucosa [24]. Subsequent research suggested the increased apoptosis of Treg cells in IBD can be reversed by anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy, and this would be a critical factor in the recurrence of disease [25, 26]. Nevertheless, the clearly core mechanism of Treg-mediated suppression is still controversial. Although IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and some other molecules have been reported to account for the regulatory activity of Treg cells, antibodies to these molecules in some cases had no effect or only minimally inhibited Treg cells activity in vitro [27\u201329]. Recent findings have revealed the possible importance of the contribution of FGL2 to the suppressive activity of Treg cells [18, 30, 31].",

            "text": "FGL2, consists of 432 aa and contains a C-terminal fibrinogen-related domain (FRED), which is a highly conserved region and is characteristic of proteins within the fibrinogen superfamily [11]. These functionally diverse proteins, including fibrinogen, tenascin, angiopoietin, and ficolin, have been shown to have immunoregulatory activity [32, 33]. Similarly, much research has recently revealed that FGL2, secreted by T cells, also has immunomodulatory activity [17]. FGL2 mRNA increased in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells, along with mRNA for several known Treg suppression effector molecules [15, 34]. Furthermore, Shalev et al. [18] reported that the suppressive activity of FGL2\u2212/\u2212 Treg cells was significantly impaired in FGL2\u2212/\u2212 mice, and antibody to FGL2 completely inhibited the activity of FGL2+/+ Treg cells in vitro. Consistent with the contribution of FGL2 to the activity of Treg cells, targeted deletion of the FGL2 gene led to an increase in immune reactivity of DC, T cells, and B cells, and the development of autoimmune glomerulonephritis in aged FGL2\u2212/\u2212 mice. The regulatory activity of FGL2 also contributes to inhibition of allograft rejection and the pathogenesis of experimental and human viral infections, including HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus [18, 30, 31, 35]. All this evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that FGL2 is an effector molecule of Treg cells. The mechanism whereby FGL2 exerts its immunomodulatory activity has been demonstrated by Liu et al. [19]. FGL2 may bind to Fc\u03b3RIIB, which is expressed on APCs, and then inhibit DC maturation and induce B cells apoptosis, eventually resulting in reduced ability to induce alloreactive T cell proliferation.",

            "text": "Given that IBD shares immunologic features with autoimmune diseases to some extent, it is logical to hypothesize that the immunomodulatory activity of FGL2 may also be involved in the immunopathogenesis of IBD. However, our study demonstrated that intestinal and peripheral expression of FGL2 was significantly higher in UC and CD patients with active disease, and decreased in inactive disease. Moreover, expression of FGL2 was positive correlated with disease activity indices, CRP levels, and ESR levels. Up-regulation of FGL2 in both UC and CD patients with active disease may be an insufficient compensation secreted by Treg cells which fails to counter chronically activated effector T cells, and which leads to inappropriate immune responses in IBD. Reduced FGL2 expression in patients with inactive disease may be because successful treatment, including immune modifiers, anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy, and other anti-inflammatory treatment, made up for the deficiency of Treg cells, or reversed the deficiency to exert sufficient suppression against other subsets of T lymphocytes through multiple other suppression molecules. This assumption is in agreement with the results of Maul et al. [24], which reported a decrease of peripheral Treg cells and an insufficient increase in intestinal lesions, and also consistent with therapeutic strategies in which immune modifiers [1] or anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy [25] are used.",
