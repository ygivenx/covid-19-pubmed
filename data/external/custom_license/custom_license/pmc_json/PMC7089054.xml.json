            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute viral respiratory disease of chickens and results in a significant economic loss to commercial chicken industries in many countries of the world. The disease is characterized by respiratory signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge [1]. All ages of chickens are susceptible to IBV infection, but the clinical signs are more severe in young chickens [2]. In hens, respiratory distress and a decrease in egg production have been reported [3]. Some strains of IBV can cause acute nephritis and urolithiasis associated with a high mortality of infected chickens [4, 5]. In addition, IBV has also been reported to cause proventriculitis [6]. Furthermore, the disease is a risk factor for secondary bacterial infections resulting in an even higher morbidity and mortality rate [5].",

The genome of IBV consists of positive sense single stranded RNA, approximately 27.6 kilobases in length [7], that is encoded for four structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and spike (S) glycoprotein [8]. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits [9]. The S1 subunit, located on the outside of virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the cell membrane of the host [7]. It contains virus neutralization and serotype-specific epitopes that are formed by amino acid within the defined hypervariable region (HVR); therefore, the molecular characterization of IBV is based on an analysis of the S1 gene [10].",

Recently, we characterized IBV isolated in Thailand from January to June 2008 by analysis of the HVR of S1 genes and found that the Thai IBV isolates were divided into two groups, QX-like IBV and that unique to the Thai strain [17]. In this study, the objective was to determine the genetic variation exhibited within Thai IBV isolates in 2008\u20132009 by analysis of the complete S1 genes and comparing them with previously published strains.",

Surprisingly, when the S1 genes of the group II Thai IBV were analyzed, recombination event was also observed in the nucleotide sequences near the cleavage recognition site. Although the group II Thai IBV appeared to be similar to QXIBV, a region near the cleavage recognition site was found to be similar to JX/99/01 isolated China in 1999 [24]. Our primary concern was that the possible viral recombination resulting from the co-infection of heterologous field strains in the chicken flocks. The recombination may be subsequently occurring with co-infection with QXIBV and JX/99/01 resulting for the occurrence of the group II Thai IBV. After that, the co-infection and exchange of genetic information between the group II Thai IBV and isolate THA001 resulted in the occurrence of the group I Thai IBV. As reported by Wang et al. [25], the evidence of natural recombination could occur within the S1 gene of IBV field isolates. The natural recombination events observed here indicated that the S1 gene of IBV was the potential site for recombination and that the exchange of genetic information could occur in more than one region of the gene.",
