In this paper we study small clusters of highly cited research, called \u201cresearch fronts.\u201d We work to provide quantitative and qualitative support for continued, focused study of these areas as important for understanding the development of science and technology more broadly. These areas of intensive work are interesting to R&D laboratories looking for future innovation breakthroughs, venture capitalists looking to allocate investment, governments interested in promoting emerging science, and researchers hoping to work on promising topics.",

This includes detecting them as they emerge and understanding the role these fronts play in the development of science and technology. The broad requirement of this methodology is that it does not presuppose the existence of any specific research area, such as would be required in a traditional literature-searching approach, nor any prior knowledge about the scientific area, but instead relies on an objective, comprehensive monitoring of citations. It should be possible to increase or decrease the sensitivity of the detection by adjusting parameters and make direct comparisons of different time slices. In addition, the method should be multidisciplinary and utilize field normalization to obtain a systematic view across different disciplines. The scope should be scalable from the micro-structure to the macro-structure of science to see the context of the innovation. Finally, the method should capture both social aspects and the topical content of scientific areas.",

New scientific findings may initiate the process of front formation by attracting the interest of more scientists who form social ties and generate more findings. The relevance and bearing of each new finding is continuously defined and evolved by the group. The foci of interests can be driven, of course, by the sources of funding as well as perceived scientific potential. This combined intellectual and social process is seen most vividly in the publications and citation patterns in science and technology. It is manifest in the emergence of clusters of highly cited papers representing the key scientific findings that are cited jointly.

In the first case, the front may initially grow in size and then split off as a new field of research or even develop into a new discipline (Small and Greenlee 1990). Alternatively, in the second case, a successful front may have great influence on its field and thus be incorporated by it, effectively being \u201cabsorbed\u201d by the appropriation of the insights of the front within a broader field. This process of absorption, as it pertains to specific findings and papers in science, was described by Robert Merton as \u201cobliteration by incorporation,\u201d in which explicit mention of prior knowledge can disappear because of its very success in generating interest and use (Merton 1968, 1972).",

Potentially, for example, fronts that combine disciplines and challenge existing paradigms will have more difficulty being absorbed and may, in aggregate, presage paradigm shifts (Kuhn 1970). The progress of science is a result of the virtual and actual collaboration of thousands of scientists who, formally and informally, share their findings and build on one another\u2019s work. The research on explicit collaboration between scientists has emphasized the value of cross-company alliances, informal networks, and social capital (Gittelman 2003). Interdisciplinary work, as a process for sharing information and as an inspiration for analogies, is often seen as one of the drivers of innovation (Amir 1985; Birnbaum 1981a, b; Ponzi 2002). In the absence of such interdisciplinary work, knowledge tends to become more compartmentalized and the interference of disruptive paradigms become more likely as tensions between distinct theories accumulate (Fleming and Sorenson 2001). We examine the role of interdisciplinary research in research fronts when knowledge combines from different disciplines in an intellectually cohesive manner (Cuhls 2003).",

Our data consist of highly cited articles clustered through co-citation to obtain closely related sets of articles. Earlier studies have shown that these clusters, or fronts, correspond to small, socially cohesive groups of scientists working on closely related topics (Small 2003). A few studies have attempted to find or predict emerging areas of research, particularly over such a comprehensive database (Small 2005). Using single link clustering, we have a rapid and efficient means to analyze large data sets in successive time frames to identify new or continuing clusters.

Rather it selects whatever papers are highly cited using a global criterion and clusters these papers based on their pattern of co-citation. One limitation of this method is that it will not identify a specialty if none of its papers have become highly cited. Thus, the co-citation method will not detect an area immediately upon its emergence, but rather at some later stage in its development. In addition the method does not identify all papers that might be considered relevant to the area. Rather, it is designed to simply detect that a research area exists and provide a sample of its highly cited and citing papers. The distinguishing feature of the method is that it is designed to do a quick screening of the scientific landscape rather than a definitive delineation of some specific area.",

Because only a single co-citation link at a specified threshold is needed to join a paper to an existing cluster, the method has a tendency to create very large clusters by chaining unless the co-citation threshold is not carefully controlled. Studies of individual clusters have shown that by varying this linkage threshold, upward for larger clusters or downward for smaller clusters, it is possible to identify the level at which chaining begins and below which the size of the cluster increases exponentially rather than linearly. It is possible to optimize the threshold for each single-link cluster by picking the lowest possible link threshold prior to this onset of sudden expansion. This can be achieved in an approximate way by defining a low starting level, setting a maximum cluster size and incrementing the threshold until a cluster within the desired size limit is formed, in effect, optimizing each cluster. The process is analogous to pruning a tree where none of the pruned branches are larger than a preset size (Small 1985).",

Average age of papers is positive for citations but negative for growth, perhaps because older fronts remain distinct and have not been absorbed, indicating a survival bias over time. Percent of author affiliations from non-academic institutions was not significant in either model. This may be due to the confounding of government and firm involvement in non-academic affiliations, but our best attempts to further divide these two classes of affiliation and add them to the model did not yield more significant results. In both models the controls for discipline, accomplished via 21 dummy variables, are statistically significant as a group. To establish the significance of these we jointly tested the 21 discipline dummy variables using a Wald test.

Two space physicists at the University of Pennsylvania indicated that this project releases data periodically and that our identification of a high-impact cluster of papers on this topic was largely a function of the punctuated release of information rather than some important breakthrough or area of new interest among researchers. The strength of our methodology, in such cases, is that it checks for endogeneity and absorption levels so that such artifacts can be identified.",

We generated citing papers sets for each front, and analyzed some bibliometric and social characteristics of these sets to better understand why the fronts emerged. To create these statistics, we analyzed the cited and citing paper sets for each of the two fronts. Self-citation involves matching author names on cited and citing papers, and counts the number of citations where one of the citing authors on a paper matched one of the cited authors. All self-citation counts are within the expected range. The percentage of citing papers by cited authors counts the number of citing papers having one or more authors from the highly cited paper set. Hence, this measures the degree to which leading authors are still active in producing current papers, and the degree to which they are citing one another. The percent of cited papers and citing papers in the current year measures the degree to which the research area is \u201cfront loaded\u201d with papers in the most current year of the six-year time window used to create the cluster. A high value for this measure is expected for an emerging research area based on a high volume of current papers. Finally the endogeneity, previously discussed, is given for each front.",

The method attempts to arrange the papers in two dimensions such that the residual force or stress in the system is minimized. Each circle on a map is a paper whose size is proportional to its citation count. Circles of papers of the final year of the year range are one color; circles of other papers are in a contrasting color.

The abnormal cleaving of APP generates A\u03b2 peptides that are deposited in senile plaques in the brains of aged individuals and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Leem et al. 2002), which may lead to the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.

For qualitative richness and for expert external validation, we interviewed researchers in industry and academia to obtain their feedback regarding our method for identifying \u201chot\u201d areas of emerging research. Quantitatively, we focused on differentiating between fronts that maximize their \u201cabsorption\u201d or impact by being highly cited by others at the cost of being less distinct as a front as their knowledge is incorporated into broader research, and fronts that maximize their \u201cemergence\u201d or size by growing more as a distinct, cohesive unit. We show that there are fundamental differences in the structure of these two sorts of successful research fronts. This may affect the way science as a whole absorbs or splinters off new areas of research and may have important consequences for its evolution and development over time.",

Examining the dynamic consequences of this possibility would be fruitful for future research. We also studied how the \u201cendogeneity\u201d of a cluster affects its growth and impact. While endogeneity is positively associated with research fronts that are growing, it is negatively associated with research fronts whose knowledge is being absorbed via increased citation. Further, endogeneity is highest among new and growing clusters. This lends support to Kuhn\u2019s speculations, and the work of Crane and Pfeffer, on the importance of intellectual cohesiveness or paradigm strength in creating a distinct research perspective, since high endogeneity can be seen as a crude sign of a more comprehensive, explanatory intellectual framework (Crane 1972; Kuhn 1970).",
