As of 14 June 2013, 58 human cases of MERS CoV infection have been confirmed resulting in 33 deaths [3]. No animal reservoir or intermediates have been definitely implicated in transmission. Limited human-to-human transmission has occurred within several clusters of cases in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UK, France, Tunisia, and Italy [4]. The UK cluster provides the clearest evidence for human-to-human transmission. Two individuals with no history of recent travel became infected shortly after exposure to a relative infected with MERS CoV who had returned from travel [5]. However, human-to-human transmissibility of MERS CoV appears to be low, as close monitoring of health-care workers and household contacts has not revealed large numbers of secondary infections [5].",

It is most closely related to coronaviruses of bat origin, and like SARS, probably originated from bats [2]. The work of Zaki et al. on respiratory samples from the first patient demonstrated that there was efficient viral replication in monkey cell lines. Apart from SARs, most other coronaviruses do not replicate well in this medium [2]. Indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for respiratory viruses including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and paramyxoviruses were negative, but PCR assay for the coronavirus family indicated the expected fragments [2]. Viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis subsequently revealed a MERS CoV in the beta-coronavirus genus, of lineage C, unlike SARS which belongs to lineage B [2].",

The striking difference is that the same number of H7N9 cases have occurred within the space of a month compared to 6 months with MERS CoV. Unlike SARS or MERS CoV, we have antiviral medications that could work against H7N9, and the hope of a vaccine being developed and brought to commercial quantities within 6 months. There are no proven vaccines or antiviral treatments against SARS even 10 years on, nor against the newly discovered MERS CoV. Without effective vaccines or therapeutics, classic public health interventions for outbreak control \u2013 isolation, quarantine and social distancing \u2013 may still remain the only effective countermeasures to stop new SARS and MERS CoV outbreaks, if sustained human-to-human transmissions occurs.
