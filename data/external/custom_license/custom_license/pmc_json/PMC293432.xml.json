[1,2] SARS case fatality has varied across geographical areas with higher fatality found in the northern areas of China. The SARS case fatalities of Beijing and Tianjin, two cities in the northern part of China, were 7.66% and 8%, respectively; while the case fatality rate of Guangdong, a province in the southern part of china was only 3.84%. Although sex ratio, age distribution, socioeconomic level, availability of health facilities, and clinical practices might be responsible for the geographical difference, air pollution could be an important determinant. Air pollution has been linked to acute respiratory inflammation, asthma attack, COPD exacerbation, and death from cardiorespiratory diseases by various studies. [3-6] In this study, the relationship between air pollution and SARS case fatality was explored via an ecologic study design.",

The biological explanation might be that long-term or short-term exposure to certain air pollutants could compromise lung function, therefore increasing SARS fatality. Both long-term and short-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with a variety of adverse health effects including acute respiratory inflammation, asthma and COPD. [3-6,9] Air pollution may predispose the respiratory epithelium of SARS patients, leading to severe respiratory symptoms and an increased risk of deaths. The adverse effect of exposure to particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) has been studies extensively. [10] A study done in US on the long-term effects of air pollution showing that each 10 micrograms/m3 elevation in PM10 accounted for 6% of increased risk of cardiopulmonary mortality. [11] Exposure to PM10 was also linked to asthma and bronchitis. Data from CNEPA showed that PM10 was the major pollutant for most monitoring areas. [7] We hypothesized that exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matters (PM10), might influence the prognosis of SARS and lead to increased risk of deaths.",

[12,13] Furthermore, we couldn't predict the direction and magnitude of the bias because of no access of the data at the individual level. Second, we had no data on the joint distribution between air pollution and potential confounders such as socioeconomic status, smoking status, age, and gender; therefore, no confounding effects could be evaluated or controlled for. The uneven application of dangerous therapy and difference in medical facilities by region might also account for the variation of case fatality. But they might not fully explain the observed association because the same therapies were recommended by the Chinese Health Ministry and CDC and followed by medical practitioners in the country. Data showed that cases from Beijing had relatively higher case fatality, although this capital city might have provided better medical support to SARS patients. Third, we assumed that air pollution was evenly distributed within each region so that we could use monitoring data colleted within each region as individual's surrogate exposure to ambient air pollutants. Exposure misclassification might have biased the study results due to the imprecise measurements. Nevertheless, this is the first observation showing that air pollution is associated with increased fatality of SARS patients in Chinese population, which deserves further investigation and might have certain impact on the study of SARS nature history.",
