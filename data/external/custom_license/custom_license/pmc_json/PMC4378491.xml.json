Our data confirm that PDCoV strains OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 are enteropathogenic and acutely infect the entire intestine. However, the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. PDCoV infection caused severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by severe diarrhea, vomiting, or both. These clinical and pathologic features in PDCoV-infected pigs resemble those of PEDV and TGEV infections. Differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and TGEV is critical to control virus epidemic diarrhea on swine farms in the United States.",

A) Intestine of pig 3 at hour postinoculation (hpi) 72 (48\u201351 h after onset of clinical signs), showing thin and transparent intestinal walls (duodenum to colon) and accumulation of large amounts of yellow fluid in the intestinal lumen (arrows).

C) Jejunum of noninoculated pig 7, showing normal villous epithelium (original magnification \u00d780). D) Jejunum of pig 4 at hpi 96 (72\u201374 h after onset of clinical signs), showing acute diffuse, severe atrophic jejunitis with mild cytoplasmic vacuolation at the tips of villi (arrows) (original magnification \u00d7200). E) Colon of pig 3 at hpi 72 (48\u201351 h after onset of clinical signs), showing mild cytoplasmic vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells (arrows) (original magnification \u00d7200).

G) Jejunum of pig 3 at hpi 72 (48\u201351 h after onset of clinical signs), showing that epithelial cells lining the atrophied villi are positive for PDCoV RNA (original magnification \u00d7200).

Nuclei were stained with blue-fluorescent 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride.
