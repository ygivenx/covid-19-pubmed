Among the three genotypes of Chikungunya virus [Asian; West African; and East, Central and South African (ECSA)], earlier outbreaks in India were caused by the Asian genotype. With the identification of the ECSA genotype of the virus from a field-caught mosquito in 2000 [9], the disease gained attention as a re-emerging infection. A number of CHIK outbreaks have been reported from several parts of the country during the period 2005\u20132008 [10, 11]. One of the worst affected states was Kerala in South India. As per the statistics available with the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Kerala, the number of CHIKV suspected cases were 70,780 in 2006; 24,052 in 2007; and 24,667 in 2008. The disease in 2007 and 2008 was unusual with a rapid spread, lymphadenitis, hemorrhages, hepatic involvement, severe, prolonged arthralgia, and even suspected incidences of mortality [6, 12, 13]. Genetic changes in the virus were speculated as the plausible reason for this [12, 13].",

The 11.8 kb viral genome of the CHIKV codes for four non-structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4), a core protein, and three envelope proteins (E1, E2, E3; E1 and E2 connected by a short 6K region). Previous studies show that in alphaviruses, the infectivity and virulence-associated gene mutations are distributed both in the structural and non-structural protein coding regions of the viral genome [14\u201316]. Several mutations in the structural and non-structural protein coding regions were detected in the CHIKV isolates from the Re\u2019Union outbreak [4]. A point mutation in the E1 protein (A226V) has been proven to be the main reason for altered vector specificity and epidemic potential of the re-emerging CHIKV [17, 18]. This mutation has been documented in the recent viral isolates (2007) from the Indian subcontinent, including those from Kerala [6, 12].",

The details of the primer sequences and cloning strategy are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2. RT-PCR was carried out using Fidelitaq RT-PCR kit (USB, Cleveland, Ohio). The conditions were a reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 45 min and 35 cycles of thermal cycling, which included denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and an extension at 68\u00b0C for 4 min. The fragments were subsequently cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and were sequenced using specific primers, using the Big-dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit in an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer automated DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequence contigs were assembled using CAP contig assembly program in Bio-Edit software [20].\n\n\n",

In one of the studies, these symptoms were observed in 80.8% patients in the Kerala outbreak in 2007\u20132008 [13]. Similar symptoms were seen only in 19.3% of the patients in the Re\u2019Union outbreak [26]. Skin manifestations were predominant in pediatric patients also. 75% of the CHIKV affected infants exhibited peripheral cyanosis and dermatological manifestations like generalized erythema, maculopapular rash, vesiculobullous lesions or skin peeling, as characteristic symptoms [27]. A rapid spread of the disease was observed in 2007 and 2008, than in 2006, which has been linked to the outbreak of the disease in areas with abundance of Ae. albopictus. This vector permits rapid replication of the E1 A226V mutant virus [17, 18], that was circulating in Kerala during this period [12]. Though mortalities were observed, they were not conclusively attributed to CHIKV infection [25].",

In order to identify possible correlation of the clinical severity of the disease in Kerala with CHIKV genomic changes, we analyzed full-genome sequences of the viral isolates obtained from these outbreaks. Our study exposed greater genetic heterogeneity in the CHIKV circulating in Kerala, than that was observed in earlier studies. Both coding region changes and changes in the non-coding region, especially 3\u2032NTR were observed in the study. Except for the 4 mutations\u2014E1 (V04A) [6]; E2 (K252Q), and nsP2 (V48A, L539S) [28]\u2014all the 18 mutations in the structural protein coding region and 19 mutations in the non-structural protein coding region identified in this study are new. Mutations were present throughout the genome. However, they were predominant in nsP2, E1, and E2 coding regions, which play major role in alphavirus infection and replication. Interestingly, they were more in the 2007 and 2008 isolates (Table 4). Along with the A226V mutation in the E1 protein, K252Q mutation in the E2 protein and L539S in the nsP2 protein were common features of most of the 2007\u20132008 Kerala isolates (Table 4). These changes and possibly other mutations in the viral proteins of the Kerala isolates might have contributed to the pathogenesis of CHIKV in these outbreaks.",

In protein model, the two observed mutations in the viral helicase domain, L237R and L238P in RGCB120 were mapped to an \u03b1-helix forming region (Fig. 4). These are non-conservative changes that could alter the conformation of this region.

In RGCB CHIKV isolates, the observed mutations in the E1 protein coding region were spread across all these functional regions (Fig. 4). Most of the mutations were in the loops of the domain II, indicating that this region plays major role in the biology of CHIKV E1 protein. Some of the changes were non-conservative (E127G, D184G, G248E), which might affect the mobility and strength of E1\u2013E1 and E1\u2013E2 interactions. The folding back of domain III and its interactions with the E1 trimer during fusion are critical events in alphavirus entry [35].

This stretch of the protein (aa 1\u2013364) in alphaviruses forms a highly hydrophilic domain. In Hopps and Woods [36] hydrophilicity prediction, the CHIKV E2 peptide 249GDRKGKIH256 within this region was the most hydrophilic. Hence it could be a potential antigenic epitope. The K252Q basic to neutral amino acid change, observed consistently in many Kerala isolates, involved this epitope and was found to reduce the predicted hydrophilicity. This, in turn, indicates altered immunogenicity of the E2 protein of the isolates. The residues corresponding to the receptor binding region of E2 in alphaviruses (aa 170\u2013220) [37] did not show mutation in the six isolates studied. The 391\u2013423 aa stretch is identified as cytoplasmic domain of E2 protein in Sindbis virus [38], and the C416G mutation that was observed in RGCB120 falls within this region. This mutation changes one of the two conserved cysteine residues. Palmitoylation of these cysteine residues are thought to be important in anchoring of the E2 to the plasma membrane, and favor interaction with the capsid protein during Sindbis virus assembly [38, 39].",

Epitopes presented by major HLA alleles, such as HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*11 [42], were shown to be involved. The latter is one of the main HLA types present in populations world over and is highly prevalent in South East Asia [43]. Classical CHIKV infections are known to offer long-term protection [44]. However, the variations in these epitopes have the potential to affect the cell-mediated immune response to CHIKV antigens.",

This indicates that the viral strains causing the latter outbreaks were similar to the strains that were circulating in 2007. The timelines of the outbreak with an inter-epidemic period of almost a year (May\u2013October 2007 and May\u2013September 2008) clearly points out that the viral strains were maintained in active form in the region during this period. Further investigations are essential to understand whether this was contributed by sporadic incidences of the disease, which was prevailing undetected in the population, or through natural reservoirs of the Chikungunya virus such as non-human primates or vector mosquitoes [1].",

Evolvement of a new genetic clade among these viruses was also observed in phylogenetic analysis. The samples analyzed represent only a small cross section of the cases from massive Chikungunya outbreaks in the state. However, the study points out genome microevolution of the viral strains, which might have affected the disease profile. Functional studies on these mutant viruses would help to understand the correlation of these genetic changes to CHIKV virulence and pathogenesis.",
