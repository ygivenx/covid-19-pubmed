Therefore, a patient with a minor illness may develop a very serious disease or even cause a disastrous infection. Thus, developing countries should spend a substantial amount of manpower and funding to solve the problem. As a representative of developing countries, China once suffered greatly because of the problems posed by its huge population and the uneven distribution of limited medical resources. The SARS virus affected the entire Asia and caused serious consequences in 2003 [1]. Thousands of people were affected and many of them died because the first few patients delayed treatment. The Ebola virus [2], which rages in Africa, also broke out because the first few patients did not obtain timely treatment.",

When the node reaches the target node and transmits a message, the path could be guaranteed to be the shortest one with ample network bandwidth and buffer memory space.

In the spray phase, the source node first counts the available nodes around for message transmission and transmits its message to the surrounding nodes by spraying. In the wait phase, the message is transmitted to the target node via direct delivery to fulfill the transmission process if no available node could be found in the spray phase. This method is a modified algorithm that improves the flood transmission of the original Epidemic algorithm.
