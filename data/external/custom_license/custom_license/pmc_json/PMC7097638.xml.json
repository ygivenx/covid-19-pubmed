            "text": "New possibilities for the design of coronavirus vaccines have been opened up with the elucidation of the structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike protein. The RBD of the SARS spike protein is responsible for virus attachment to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), on human cells. The RBD of the human epidemic strain differs from that of the animal virus by just two amino acids. Harrison and colleagues determined the complex of the interacting segments of these proteins, which consists of residues 19\u2013615 of the peptidase domain of human ACE2 and residues 323\u2013502 of the RBD, to 2.9-\u00c5 resolution.",

            "text": "The ACE2 peptidase domain comprises two lobes that close during substrate binding, and the spike RBD contacts the tip of one lobe when ACE2 is either open or closed. The RBD has a five-stranded, antiparallel \u03b2-sheet core, and an extended-loop subdomain that lies along one edge of the core. A two-stranded \u03b2-sheet in this loop forms a concave surface that cradles the N-terminal helix of ACE2, and ridges along either side of the loop interact with structural features of ACE2. This loop (residues 424\u2013494) was named the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and makes the only contacts with ACE2, producing a 1,700 \u00c52 interface that is consistent with the high binding affinity of these proteins (Kd \u223c10\u22128). The detailed analysis of the contacts between these two proteins provides useful information for rational vaccine design. REFERENCE Li, F. et al.

            "text": "The solution structures of the four RNA-binding domains (RBDs) of polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein-1 (PTB1) in complex with RNA have now been solved by Oberstrass et al., leading to new models for the function of PTB1 as a repressor of alternative splicing. As an abundant eukaryotic RNA-binding protein, PTB1 is implicated in various aspects of RNA metabolism, but how it functions in these processes is not well understood. Oberstrass et al. used NMR to look at the structure of RBD1\u20134 in complex with a 5\u2032-CUCUCU-3\u2032 oligonucleotide, which is a common feature of intronic regulatory sequences.",

The nucleotides interact with the flat \u03b2-sheet surface of each RBD but, unlike other RBD\u2013RNA structures, the third \u03b2-strand is only weakly involved in RNA binding. Whereas most RBDs have four \u03b2-strands, RBD2 and RBD3 have a fifth \u03b2-strand, which allows these domains to interact with a larger nucleotide sequence.",

A single PTB1 molecule can therefore bring two distant pyrimidine tracts into close proximity and induce RNA looping \u2014 a feature that has led to the proposal of various models for the function of this protein in alternative splicing.
