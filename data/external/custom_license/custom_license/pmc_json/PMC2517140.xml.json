            "text": "The influenza virus hemagglutinin is the best characterized of all viral fusion proteins. The crystal structure of its ectodomain in a pre-fusion conformation was determined in classic work by Wiley, Wilson and Skehel in 1981 (refs. 18,19); the post-fusion conformation was finally visualized in 1994 (ref. 20), and the uncleaved precursor, HA0, in 1998 (ref. 21). The core of HA1 is a sialic acid\u2013binding domain, borne on a stalk formed by HA2. The central feature of the stalk is a three-chain, \u03b1-helical coiled coil. HA0 and its cleaved product, pre-fusion HA1\u2013HA2, are essentially identical in overall structure. The cleavage, which normally happens in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but which can also occur after viral budding, leads to a modest local rearrangement, in which the newly generated N terminus of HA2 inserts into a pocket along the three-fold axis, burying the fusion peptide (the first 20\u201325 residues of HA2). The pocket is created by a splaying apart from each other of the C termini of the HA2 coiled-coil helices, so that the three helices diverge from the three-fold axis and from each other, rather like a narrow tripod (Fig. 3a).",

            "text": "Sialic acid, on glycoproteins or glycolipids, is the influenza virus receptor; HA1 bears the binding site, a shallow pocket exposed on its outward-facing surface22. As the plasma membrane recycles regularly through various forms of endocytosis, the virus-receptor complex may not require a specific endocytic signal in order to reach an endosome. When the HA1:HA2 trimer encounters low pH, it undergoes a large-scale conformational rearrangement, in which HA1 separates from HA2 (Fig. 3a to Fig. 3b), except for a residual disulfide tether, and the latter effectively turns inside out20,23,24. The two key features of this HA2 refolding are a loop-to-helix transition25 in the region connecting the fusion peptide to the central coiled coil (Fig. 3b to Fig. 3c) and reorientation of the C-terminal part of the molecule so that it zips up alongside the extended coil (Fig. 3c to Fig. 3d). These correspond, respectively, to formation of the extended intermediate and to its collapse into a conformation that brings together the fusion peptide and the transmembrane anchor. The loop-to-helix transition in the N-terminal part of HA2 augments the central coiled-coil at its N-terminal end (Fig. 3c); reorientation of the C-terminal part of the protein breaks the central helices where they splay apart, at the site from which the fusion peptide has withdrawn earlier in the fusion process (Fig. 3c to Fig. 3d).",

Mutations at widely distributed locations affect the stability of trimer interfaces that break during the rearrangement and thereby alter the threshold pH for fusion26. Conserved ionizable residues (two aspartates and a histidine) in the vicinity of the buried fusion peptide may contribute to the trigger; comparison of their interactions before and after cleavage of HA0 (and hence before and after insertion of the fusion peptide into the cavity) does not, however, lead to an obvious explanation for why HA0 does not undergo a proton-induced conformational change21. Redundant contributions to pH-regulated processes often make identification of critical residues difficult (as illustrated by the history of investigations into the hemoglobin Bohr effect) because loss of one contributing site may not lead to significant loss of fitness or to pronounced change in pH dependence.",

That is, each HA2 chain can complete its refolding independently of the other two, and the loss of overall three-fold symmetry during the transition (Fig. 1c,d) is a natural consequence of this independence. Formation of the cap structure (Fig. 3e) restores global three-fold symmetry; if the transmembrane helices pass completely through the bilayer, this step probably requires the presence of an aqueous channel\u2014that is, a committed fusion pore (Fig. 1e).",

Immature virions do not fuse, even when triggered by lowering the pH, as prM is essentially a chaperone that prevents the fusion-inducing conformational transition.

The dimers dissociate, allowing the individual subunits to swing outward36. The now-exposed fusion loops insert into the target membrane, facilitating reclustering of the subunits into trimers. Collapse of the extended, trimeric intermediate that results from these events can then proceed, by rotation of domain III in each subunit about the segment that links it to domain I and (presumably) by zipping up of the stem alongside the clustered domains II. Protonation of one or two conserved histidine residues at the domain I\u2013domain III interface probably contributes to initiating this process37. Mutations around a hydrophobic pocket at the domain I\u2013domain II interface also affect the pH threshold; this region undergoes a hinge-like change during the transition, and alterations in the bulk of the hydrophobic side chains that face the pocket could influence both the kinetic barrier and the net free energy change of the process10.",

G has two hydrophobic loops that can cross-link to derivatized membrane lipids39; the structures show that these loops, each of which links a pair of antiparallel \u03b2-strands, lie next to each other at the tip of an elongated domain (Fig. 5a). In the pre-fusion conformation, these domains face the viral membrane. In the post-fusion conformation, they cluster around the three-fold axis, presenting the fusion loops to the target membrane (Fig. 5e). The connectivity of the strands joined by the fusion loops is different from the connectivity in domain II of flavivirus E and alphavirus E1 (that is, the domains themselves have different folds), but the general picture is quite similar: hydrophobic residues (including at least one tryptophan) are displayed on tightly structured loops at the end of an elongated domain.",

We can analyze the structure as three domains, each of roughly invariant fold, linked by segments that change conformation as the domains rotate with respect to one another (Fig. 5). A core domain, based on a \u03b2-sandwich (red in Figs. 5b\u2013d) and a relatively long \u03b1-helix (light blue in Figs. 5b\u2013d), dominates the threefold contact in the high-pH (pre-fusion) conformation. This domain contains residues from the N-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain and residues from near the C-terminal part of the chain: we can consider it a framework around which the rest of the molecule reorients. The other two domains form a jointed, two-part fusion machinery. The net effect of their rotations relative to each other and to the core domain is to translate the fusion loops, at the tip of the outermost domain, away from the viral membrane and toward the target membrane. In a likely extended intermediate conformation (shown in Fig. 5c, but for which there are as yet no direct structural data), the C-terminal segment still connects \u2018downward\u2019, even as the fusion loops interact with the target. In the fully rearranged, low-pH conformation (Figs. 5d,e), the C-terminal segment has zipped up along the fusion domains, much as in the flavivirus fusion transition. Aside from this zipping up of the C terminus, the most pronounced conformational change is the loop-to-helix transition of the 12-residue segment between the fusion domains and the core domain (Fig. 5b to Fig. 5c, blue helix), reminiscent of the even more notable loop-to-helix transition in influenza HA2. As in hemagglutinin, the loop-to-helix transition in VSV-G creates a long, three-chain coiled coil at the trimer axis and seems to propel the fusion loops toward the target membrane.",

Priming is usually the result of proteolysis\u2014either of the fusion protein itself, as in the case of influenza hemagglutinin or retroviral Env, or of an accompanying protein, as in the case of flavi- and alphaviruses. For these viruses, priming occurs during transport of the immature glycoprotein to the cell surface, either before assembly of the virus particle by budding at the cell surface or after a formation of an immature particle by budding through an internal membrane. The glycoproteins of other viruses\u2014Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in particular\u2014require cleavage by endosomal cathepsins B or L during cell entry rather than during maturation42,43. The SARS coronavirus spike protein, S, is a trimer of uncleaved chains on the virion surface, but receptor binding seems to make it susceptible to cathepsin L (ref. 43). In addition to making the fusogenic conformational rearrangement possible, cathepsin attack, by releasing a covalent constraint, may also be sufficient to induce the rearrangement\u2014that is, cleavage may be a triggering as well as a priming step, after a \u2018pre-priming\u2019 by the receptor interaction. The Ebola virus glycoprotein, GP0, is cleaved by furin to GP1 and GP2 before incorporation into virions. Degradation of GP1 by cathepsins may be part of the triggering step, to release GP2 from the constraints that prevent its fusogenic conformational rearrangement, but some further endosomal activity seems to be required as well44.",

A covalent peptide bond (either in the fusion protein itself, as in hemagglutinin, or in the chaperone or guard protein, as in dengue prM-E) restrains the initial, folded conformation of the precursor. Once that covalent restraint has gone (irreversibly), a high kinetic barrier still separates the primed from the post-fusion conformation. The trigger that lowers this barrier (or provides the required activation energy) can be binding of a proton, for viruses that have evolved to detect a low-pH, endosomal environment, or binding of a co-receptor in some other cases (for example, HIV-1); for herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses, the trigger is an altered lateral contact with another viral surface protein that has itself changed conformation because of binding with a cellular receptor. Whatever the trigger, association with the ligand alters the free energy profile, so that rearrangement to the post-fusion state is rapid. The free energy liberated by the rearrangement can then be used to overcome the barrier to merging two membrane bilayers.",

For influenza virus hemagglutinin, the first event must be loosening of the restraints on HA2 imposed by HA1. HA1 is linked to HA2 by a disulfide near the base of the trimer, so that it cannot dissociate completely, but it clearly must get out of the way of the loop-to-helix transition and the subsequent zippering step45 (Fig. 3b). For flavivirus E proteins, the initial dissociation of the dimer probably allows the monomer to flex outward, encounter the target membrane and associate into trimers36 (Fig. 4b\u2013d). Soluble E ectodomain dimers dissociate reversibly at low pH and redimerize if the pH is returned to neutral. If liposomes are present in the low-pH step, however, the fusion loops insert into the lipid bilayer and the protein trimerizes irreversibly46. The bilayer is a surface catalyst in this context: by aligning the individual subunits in a preferred orientation (fusion-loop tip in the membrane), it lowers the barrier that separates the free monomer from the true minimum-energy state represented by the post-fusion trimer.",

The post-fusion conformation of the gp41 ectodomain is particularly simple\u2014just a trimer of hairpins, in which both prongs of the hairpin are \u03b1-helices49\u201351(Fig. 6). Approximately 50 residues immediately C-terminal to the fusion peptide (designated HR1, where \u201cHR\u201d stands for \u201cheptad repeats\u201d) form a central, three-chain coiled coil. A loop that contains a conserved disulfide bond connects the HR1 segment to a second heptad-repeat element, HR2, which forms an outer-layer \u03b1-helix. Peptides from this outer layer can inhibit the fusion process52,53. The mechanism involves association of the peptide with the inner core, preventing transition to the post-fusion conformation. The lifetime of the intermediate, as detected by the capacity of such peptides to inhibit fusion during the period after attachment and initiation of conformation change, is at least several minutes54; its magnitude is probably determined by the resistance of the two membranes to being pulled toward each other. Without that resistance, the zipping up of the outer layer might be too rapid for peptide to intervene. HIV fusion occurs at the cell surface, and one such inhibitory peptide (T-20, or enfuvirtide) is a clinically useful drug55. Mutations conferring resistance to T-20 can occur at various positions in the envelope protein, including residues in gp120 (ref. 56). Some of the mutations in HR1 that reduce T-20 binding also retard fusion and enhance sensitivity to antibodies targeting the membrane-proximal region of gp41 (ref. 57). There is also biochemical evidence that the extended intermediate is the target for this set of neutralizing antibodies58.",

The flared region has positive curvature in one direction (around the axis of the nipple) and negative in the other (within the plane of the cross-section in Fig. 1c), and hence little net elastic distortion. Using reasonable dimensions for the bud5, one can estimate the difference in area between the inner and outer leaflets of the positively curved cap as 2 \u00d7 104 \u00c52. Available structural data show that fusion loops and fusion peptides insert only partway into the outer leaflet of the target membrane, displacing lipid head groups laterally and therefore favoring curvature of the leaflet11,17,27. But their contribution is probably only a modest fraction of the total curvature in the cap. For example, the tip of one flavivirus trimer occupies about 800 \u00c52.

The direction of curvature promoted by the observed insertion does suggest, however, that as the extended intermediates collapse, their fusion peptides or fusion loops may tend to concentrate in the positively curved cap and migrate toward the developing hemifusion stalk. At this stage, they may contribute substantially to the difference between the areas of the inner and outer leaflets.",

It thus seems that collapse of the extended intermediate\u2014the transition that induces hemifusion-stalk formation\u2014is not sufficient to drive the fusion process to completion. At the hemifusion stage, a hemagglutinin-induced fusion pore can flicker open and closed6, and we may infer that some property of the fusion protein, connected with complete traversal of the membrane, must accelerate the forward reaction. The capping of the central helix in influenza HA2 (Fig. 3e) shows that formation of a well-defined structure, with tight hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions among the participating amino acid residues, brings about a concerted closure of the conformational transition, drawing the near ends of the transmembrane helices together and causing the cytoplasmic segments on the opposite side of the membrane to pass into or through the nascent fusion pore24. Presence of these segments in the aqueous channel of a fusion pore will prevent its resealing and may explain how a cytoplasmic element at the far end of the transmembrane anchor can drive the fusion process forward65. In other words, formation of a cap on the HA2 helical bundle when zipping-up is complete becomes a mechanism for making pore formation irreversible28 because cap formation couples to a translocation, into or through the pore, of material from the cytoplasmic face of the bilayer.",

Small molecules have been found that block HIV fusion, by screening for compounds that compete with an outer-layer peptide for binding to the three-helix bundle of the post-fusion gp41 inner core66. It might be possible to extend this strategy to many other viruses, as zipping up of an outer-layer segment against the inner core of an intermediate is a universal feature of the fusion-inducing conformational changes illustrated in Figures 3\u20136.",

Productive receptor binding must expel the compound from this site and thus incur an inhibitor-specific free-energy cost. A candidate has been described for a similar kind of site on dengue virus E\u2014a pocket that disappears when the protein starts to rearrange10. Indeed, any protein that undergoes a large-scale conformational change is likely to have some sort of small-molecule binding site that changes or disappears in the transition from one state to the other.
