Some articles represent discoveries and others review, introduce, test,\nor trial algorithms or tools that are potentially helpful to arrive at\ndiscoveries. A few articles, however, are reversed in that they demonstrate how\nbioinspired algorithms or biological devices can solve hard computational\nchallenges. Consider that manipulating chemicals may compute an answer much faster\nthan by means of the standard silicon-based computer and within this special issue there is an article by K. Li et al. describing the principles by which such a DNA  computer can compromise an encryption algorithm that is central to present day secure communications.",

Synthetic and systems\nbiotechnology, for example, is a technology at these frontiers  that aims to sequester the services of micro-organisms for the\nbenefit of mankind. Its ability to produce foods in a vat that would otherwise\ntake up valuable land resources with conventional agriculture will offer\nflexibility in food production. In their article, M.-J. Han et al. reveal how\nknowledge and understanding of cell physiology in the presence of oleic\nacid are obtained for E. coli. Interesting research about signaling\nnetworks in retina, as induced by light exposure in mice, is presented by J.\nKrishnan et al. showing marked alterations in gene expression upon light exposure.\nCertain transcription factors are discovered to be important for the responses\nto light-induced retinal loss, revealing that many of the apoptosis-related\ngenes are up- or downregulated in this process. In their article, R.\nMoreno-Sanchez et al. offer a very useful review of metabolic control analysis\n(MCA), a tool that represents a type of engineering control theory for cell\nbiology and when applicable MCA can help to grapple with an understanding of\nthe complex control of the metabolic pathways.",

            "text": "Also in the first grouping, three articles by S. Huang and his colleagues develop the emergent and interdisciplinary field of infectomics, which is\nthe study of infectomes encoded by the genomes of microbes and their hosts.\nInfectomics has potential to advance the rational strategies that will prevent\nand treat infectious diseases as these could require a full appreciation of the\ninfectomes that contribute to microbial infections. There is a need to figure\nout how to dissect the dynamic duality relationship between symbiosis and\npathogenesis in microbial infections, and advocates of this new field oppose what they see as\nthe misguided, though current and popular,\nreductionist and Manichean views of the microbe-human host relationship.\nAnother article on the topic of infectious diseases by K.-Y. Hwa et al.\ninvestigates the emerging and life-threatening infectious disease known as\nSARS, where there is a compelling need for the development of effective\ntherapeutics. Their article presents interesting and potentially important\nfindings, that molecular mimicry occurs between SARS-CoV and host proteins.\nThey investigate how to predict those peptides that are worthy of exploration\nfor their biological activity. The article by L. Hamel et al. provides novel insight into the field of phylogenetics with the idea of the spectra of a tree, and reviewers identified its potential to compare with phylogenetic trees across different genes and for detecting lateral gene transfer.",

            "text": "The first grouping of articles also covers specialist numerical\nalgorithms for gene sequencing, genomics, and proteomics. With genomic\nsequencing, an error in contig assembly causes serious error proliferation, and\nConPath (P.-G. Kim et al.) is a tool that can address this problem. It\nconstructs scaffolds, ordering and orienting separate sequence contigs by exploiting\nthe mate-pair information between contig pairs. C.-K. Chan et al. develop the\ngrowing self-organized map (GSOM) for binning (the clustering of these\nunassembled DNA sequences). They report improvements over the binning that\ncombines oligonucleotide frequency and self-organizing maps (SOMs), and\nidentify suitable training features and quantitative measures for assessing\nresults in this area. In their article, K. Han et al. develop an algorithm to\nsearch for the highly connected subgraphs in protein interaction networks\nbecause this might be helpful to predict protein function. The article by\nMi-Young Kim expounds a new approach to the very important problem of text\nmining of biomolecular text, and is specifically concerned with detecting gene\ninteractions. There follow two articles in biological chemistry with computational  \nchemistry. C.-J. Kuo et al. solve the crystal structure of H. pylori undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase and perform virtual screening of inhibitors from a chemical library of thousands of compounds. M. Muddassar et al. explore receptor-guided 3D-QSAR to design\nIGF-1R inhibitors by pursuing careful statistical analysis to interpret the\nmodels that are obtained with the help of contour maps. The article by J.-C.\nLue and W.-C. Fang proposes a compact integrated microsystem solution for\nrobust, real-time, and onsite genetic analysis. It uses a preceding VLSI\ndifferential logarithm microchip that is designed to compute the logarithm of\nthe normalized input fluorescence signals and a succeeding VLSI artificial\nneural network (ANN) processor chip to analyze the processed signals from the\ndifferential logarithm stage. It is submitted that the version of ANN chosen is\nparticularly adept at recognizing the low-fluorescence patterns.",

These fields sit in the frontiers of biosciences, image analysis,\nmathematics, and numerical methods. In this grouping, a number of articles\nimplement (D. Howard et al.), evaluate (N. A. Lee et al.), or introduce (J. Kolibal et al.) techniques of image analysis to cluster, segment, or\nanalyze images, or extract information or enrich biomedical images. For\nexample, J. Woo et al. discuss multimodal data integration for computer-aided\nablation of atrial fibrillation. Y. Park et al. analyze the interpoint\ndissimilarity comparisons in the hippocampus shape space to distinguish between\nhippocampi of subjects with three conditions (clinically depressed, high risk,\nand control subject), and discover the high-risk population closer in shape\nspace to the control population than to the clinically depressed population.\nAdditionally, they find that the left hippocampi carry more information than do\nthe right. In their article, N. A. Lee et al. examine performance in the\nsegmentation of high-resolution MRI subvolumes containing hippocampus,\nprefrontal cortex, and occipital lobe, as acquired on different scanners. They\noffer evidence that the alternating kernel mixture algorithm outperforms\nalternatives on the ten datasets considered. The availability of powerful\nimaging and other sensors, the availability of information technology, and the\nnature of modern threats point to population biometrics as a topic of enormous\ncurrent and future importance. Implementing biometrics well is hard and is not\nyet properly understood. The methodological paper by Y. N. Shin et al. proposes\na formal performance evaluation model for a biometric recognition system. They\nalso implement face recognition systems based on the proposed model. The model\nseems to be useful in terms of database availability, compliance with\nstandards, and evaluation costs. The proposed formalism may gain traction for\nother biometrics, and it has the potential to inform strategies for\npopulation-based biomedical imaging performance evaluation and standardization. The last article of this second grouping by J. Wichard et al.\nevaluates how bioinspired and computational intelligence algorithms compare in providing reliable early cancer diagnosis.",

Merritt et al. on the equine distal forelimb, which\nis a common location of injuries related to mechanical overload. These authors\ncombine analysis with experiment in a fairly thorough but concise way to\ncalculate the forces in the major tendons and joint reaction from kinematic and\nkinetic data of walking and trotting horses. Their findings point to the\nimportance of muscle tendon wrapping when evaluating joint loading in the distal\nforelimb. The article by C. Handapangoda and M. Premaratne describes a novel\nnumerical technique for modeling optical pulse propagation in inhomogeneous\nscattering and absorption cross-sections through weakly scattering biological\ntissues. The design of implantable electronic devices to interact with\nthe nervous system is an active field, the development of an efficient system\nfor long-term stimulation of the optic nerve is rather timely (e.g., it is\nrequired to evaluate the long-term safety of retinal implants), and the\nmethodological report by J. A. Zhou et al. describes the design of a\nsuprachoroidal electrical retinal stimulator for long-term application. Finally, two articles in the third category advance novel robots (H. Sawada et al.) and haptic \nsolutions (K.-U. Kyung et al.) that interact with the human senses and which might prove helpful to the sensorially impaired.",
