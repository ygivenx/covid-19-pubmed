            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first emerged in southern China in the fall of 2002. Since then this infectious disease has become a global concern [1, 2, 3]. A novel coronavirus has been implicated with both the initial outbreak and the subsequent worldwide spread [4, 5, 6]. Cluster infections have been a common feature of SARS since its emergence [1, 2, 3]. In these clustered outbreaks some patients have progressed to respiratory failure while others have not deteriorated so markedly. The question of whether there are underlying factors that predispose to the eventual use of mechanical ventilation is important to address. In one study on 75 SARS patients the risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilatory support were age, male sex, chronic hepatitis B virus carriage, raised creatinine, and recurrent fever [7]. Fowler et al. [8] reported 38 patients with SARS-related critical illness. They described clinical course and outcomes of these critical ill patients. They also found that older age, a history of diabetes mellitus, admission tachycardia, and elevated creatine kinase were associated with poor outcome.",

In several patients there was little change in chest radiography findings, even when their lung function had deteriorated to the extent that intubation was necessary. It was thus more difficult to make the diagnosis of SARS in these patients. Physicians must pay more attention and keep alert for early diagnosis of SARS in inpatient group. Our observations serve as a cautionary note to physicians that increased attention might well be paid to inpatients if SARS is to be recognized early. Early detection of the infection and rapid isolation of SARS patient as well as intensive respiratory precautions are proving to be critical in the control of a more widely disseminated infection.",

Diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer are more prevalent in older persons and are usually associated with secondary infections that influence WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte percentage, and CRP level.

The elderly have a higher risk of respiratory failure. Moreover, a high-grade fever grade (>39.4\u00b0C) may indicate a severe inflammation or a cytokine storm.

Furthermore, of the eight family members of inpatients who kept a bedside vigil, seven progressed to acute respiratory failure. However, family members who visited an inpatient more sporadically did not succumb to respiratory failure when they contracted SARS. These observations are consistent with the suggestion that close contact with SARS patients increases the risk of respiratory failure and intubation.

It is reasonable to presume that respiratory failure rate would be greater in this patient group given these other physiological stresses. However, possibly muting the influence of these others clinical stresses are the findings that in other SARS outbreaks, previously healthy patients displayed an acute respiratory rate of 36% [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
