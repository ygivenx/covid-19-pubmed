            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses consisting of a nucleocapsid, which contains the approximately 30 kb genome and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and which is surrounded by an envelope carrying three membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M). Of these, the spike glycoprotein S is responsible for virus entry and syncytia formation, as it binds to the cellular receptor and induces membrane fusion.3, 4, 5 The specific interaction between the amino-terminal spike protein domain S1 and its cognate receptor6, 7, 8 induces conformational changes in the spike protein domain S2 that trigger the membrane fusion process. These conformational changes require physical interaction between two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2, that occur in the S2 domain. Prevention of this interaction by using peptides that correspond to these HR1 and HR2 regions can block membrane fusion, by binding of the peptides to their respective counterparts.9, 10, 11 Most coronaviruses exhibit strict species specificity, as determined by the spike\u2013receptor interaction.12, 13, 14 The coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), for instance, selectively infects and induces syncytium formation of feline cells via its receptor feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN).6 Likewise, the recombinant felinized mouse hepatitis virus (fMHV),15 a derivative of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) carrying a chimeric spike of which the ectodomain is from the FIPV spike protein, also infects and fuses only feline cells through the fAPN molecule. As a consequence of their species restricted tropism, FIPV and MHV are nonpathogenic to human cells. However, once the tropism barrier is alleviated, coronaviruses can replicate in cells of different species.15, 16 Thus, FIPV and MHV may potentially be converted into specific oncolytic agents for the treatment of human cancer if their spike protein would recognize a receptor on human tumor cells.",

To allow comparison of the two viruses in the same cells, we assessed FIPV and, instead of MHV, the chimeric coronavirus fMHV for their ability to kill human cancer cells artificially expressing fAPN. Subsequently, we investigated whether FIPV and fMHV could be targeted to human cancer cells expressing the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a molecule commonly overexpressed on many types of cancer cells17 and associated with poor prognosis and response to cancer therapy.18, 19 For this purpose, we prepared a bispecific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, binding on one side to the FIPV and fMHV spike protein and on the other side to the human EGFR. The antibody indeed functioned as a specific targeting device. Our findings justify the further development of coronaviruses as oncolytic agents.",

For comparison, the oncolytic effect of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) at 5 \u00d7 108 PFU/spheroid was also measured. At several days post-inoculation (p.i.), the cell viability was determined (Figure 2a). At day 5 p.i., a clear decrease in viability was observed for spheroids inoculated with either virus. After 2 days, the OVCAR-fAPN spheroids infected with 5 \u00d7 104 PFU fMHV were essentially destroyed, whereas spheroids infected with 5 \u00d7 108 PFU Ad5 were only partially eradicated.

To this end, A431 cells were inoculated with fMHV in scFv 23F-425-containing medium for 2 h and subsequently cultured for another 22 h in the presence or absence of scFv 23F-425.

The mechanism involves conformational changes in the spike protein subsequent to receptor binding, resulting in an interaction of the HR1 and HR2 domains, which is necessary to drive the membrane fusion process. This process can be inhibited specifically using peptides corresponding to the HR domains as we showed recently for MHV.11 In order to investigate if the bispecific antibody-targeted FIPV and fMHV infections and their induction of syncytia also depend on those conformational rearrangements in the viral spike protein, we tested the sensitivity of these processes to HR-derived peptide. To this end, we prepared a peptide corresponding to the HR1 region of the FIPV S protein and initially studied this fHR1 peptide for its ability to block FIPV and fMHV infection of feline FCWF-4 cells, which it did. As illustrated for fMHV (Figure 7a and b), addition of fHR1 during or after inoculation of feline FCWF-4 cells abrogated infection and syncytium formation, respectively. Next, we determined whether scFv 23F-425-mediated infection and syncytium formation are also sensitive to the fHR1 peptide. To this end, fMHV was targeted toward EGFR on A431 cells in the presence or absence of fHR1. As can be seen in Figure 7c and d, addition of the peptide reduced both scFv 23F-425-mediated infection and syncytium formation. Thus, both processes seem to utilize a membrane fusion process similar to that of the native coronavirus.",

First, coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that exhibit a fast, cytoplasmic transcription process leading to rapid virus protein synthesis and progeny virus production. Second, the ability of coronaviruses to induce syncytia between infected and noninfected neighboring cells amplifies their cytotoxicity. We found that FIPV and fMHV retained these properties in human cancer cells expressing the virus receptor, thus enabling a rapid cytotoxic spread of the virus to surrounding noninfected cancer cells. Coronaviruses share some of these attractive characteristics with other enveloped viruses such as a fusogenic mutant of herpes simplex virus25 and the live attenuated Edmonston B vaccine strain of measles virus.26 However, in contrast to these viruses, the coronaviruses FIPV and fMHV are normally incapable of infecting human cells, due to their restricted tropism. Thus, their native tropism does not need to be abolished in order to specifically limit their access, hence cytotoxicity, to human cancer cells.",

Although we were able to demonstrate the principle of retargeting of coronaviruses by exchanging spike ectodomains,15, 16 neither the detailed structural information nor the knowledge and technology required to purposely redesign the spike for binding to any given antigen are presently available. Therefore, as an alternative and also potentially versatile tool, we embarked on the development of a bispecific adapter. Thus, to redirect the non-human coronaviruses FIPV and fMHV to EGFR-expressing cells, we constructed the bispecific antibody molecule scFv 23F-425 that binds to both the feline spike and EGFR. The latter was chosen for its frequent overexpression on human cancer cells. Inoculation of FIPV and fMHV onto a number of different EGFR-expressing human cancer cell lines of various tissue origins in the presence of scFv 23F-425 resulted in infection, replication, and subsequent formation of syncytia. The targeted infection was completely dependent on the presence of the antibody and its efficiency generally correlated with the levels of EGFR expression on the cancer cells. These observations are similar to native coronavirus infections where virus\u2013cell and cell\u2013cell fusion efficiencies also correlate with host cell receptor density.24 The results imply that the bispecific antibody-mediated targeting approach can in principle be applied to direct coronaviruses to any cell surface antigen for which an appropriate antibody (ie hybridoma cell line) is available.",

Thus, adenoviruses expressing a bispecific scFv for targeting to EGFR showed enhanced oncolytic replication in EGFR-positive, adenovirus receptor-negative cancer cells.28 Foreign gene expression can also be achieved with coronaviruses as we showed recently after inserting different reporter genes at various positions in the MHV genome.29",

Their application in adapter-mediated targeting to tumors will thus raise serious safety questions, particularly regarding the possibility of generating viruses that acquired the capacity to infect human cells independent of targeting devices. These questions will have to be addressed. Several options to reduce the risks already exist. One is the use of coronaviruses lacking specific virulence genes; as we showed recently for MHV30 and FIPV,31 such viruses are strongly attenuated in their natural host. Another option is to combine deletion of nonessential virulence genes with genomic rearrangement; reorganization of the order of the structural protein genes, found for MHV to be tolerated without loss of viability,32 will reduce the risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses.",

It appeared that the bispecific antibody-mediated entry, as well as the antibody-mediated induction of syncytia, uses this same fusion mechanism as was illustrated most clearly by the inhibitory effect of the HR1-derived peptide. It will be interesting to find out how this fusion process actually takes place and whether, for instance, the necessary conformational changes in the S protein are induced by its interaction with the antibody or triggered by the binding to the EGFR. Alternatively, fusion may not be mediated by the spikes that effect the binding but, rather, by the conformational changes induced in the \u2018free\u2019 spikes upon interaction with undefined molecules on the target cells or by the particular conditions experienced when the virus is taken up in endosomes. Evidence for the latter mechanism might be obtained by studying whether infection can also be achieved when using a bispecific antibody not binding the virus through the S protein but through one of the other envelope proteins, M or E, as these are not involved in the fusion process.",

The Mouse ScFv Module/Recombinant Phage Antibody System (Amersham) was used to generate the scFv 23F. The mRNA was isolated from 1 \u00d7 107 23F8.1 hybridoma cells and the cDNA was produced by RT-PCR, according to the Mouse ScFv Module protocol. The variable domains of both the heavy chain (VH) and the light chain (VL) of the 23F8.1 antibody cDNA were isolated by PCR using VH and VL primers of the scFv isolation system. The fragments were cloned separately into the pGemTeasy cloning vector (Promega, Madison, USA) and sequenced. To introduce a 16-amino-acid residue middle linker, a fusion PCR was performed joining the 23F8.1-VH and 23F8.1-VL fragments in a VH\u2013VL configuration via a 48-nucleotide linker DNA. The linker DNA consists of two primers, each comprising a part of the linker sequence of scFv 42539, 40 (underlined), and flanking sequences overlapping the 3\u2032 23F8.1-VH (5\u2032-CAGAGCCACCTCCGCCTGAACCGCCTCCACCTGAGGAGACGGTGACCGT-3\u2032) and the 5\u2032 23F8.1-VL (5\u2032-CAGGCGGAGGTGGCTCTGGCGGTGGCGGATCGGACATCCAGATGACCCA-3\u2032), resulting in a Ser-(Gly4-Ser)3 linker. In a subsequent PCR, the assembled scFv DNA was amplified and restriction sites were added by using the RS primers of the scFv isolation system. The resulting DNA fragment contained a 5\u2032 SfiI site and a 3\u2032 NotI site, and was subsequently cloned into pGemTeasy and sequenced. The sequence was compared to the sequences of the independent 23F8.1-VH and 23F8.1-VL fragments, and the resulting correct clone was named pGemTeasy-23FVHVL. The pGemTeasy-23FVHVL plasmid was digested by SfiI and NotI to isolate the 754 bp scFv 23F, which was ligated into the pCANTAB derivative pSTCF40 that had been digested by SfiI and NotI, resulting in pSTCF23F. The scFv 425 directed against the EGFR was isolated from pSTCFS11-42539, 40 by NotI digestion and ligated in a VH\u2013VL configuration into the NotI site downstream of the scFv 23F in pSTCF23F creating a three Ala linker between the two scFv fragments. This resulted in the expression vector pSTCF23F-425, which contains the 1587 bp bispecific cDNA construct encoding the anti-spike scFv 23F linked to the anti-EGFR scFv 425 in fusion with an amino-terminal Ig\u03ba signal sequence and a carboxy-terminal Myc tag under the control of CMV and T7 promoters.",

The titration results revealed the optimal amount of bispecific antibody needed for maximal targeting efficiency under these standard conditions to be 200 \u03bcl scFv 23F-425. More antibody did not increase but, rather, decreased the level of infection, presumably because excess antibodies in the inoculum may bind to EGFR on cells thereby blocking their use by the virus.
