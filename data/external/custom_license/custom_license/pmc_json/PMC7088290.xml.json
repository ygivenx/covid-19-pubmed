            "text": "Bacteriophages (phages, BFs) are viruses that infect bacteria. Although their biology is mainly related to bacterial cells, they are constantly present in human life. This is not only because they occupy every environment where their host bacteria are present (e.g., water and soil), but also because they are more often used intentionally by medicine and industry. The branch of biotechnology connected with food production pins its hopes on involving bacteriophages in the fight against the bacterial infection of food products. For instance, in 2006 the FDA approved the use of a Lysteria monocytogenes-specific preparation on ready-to-eat meat and poultry products (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/opabacqa.html). As bacteriophages are very efficient and, what is important, very specific antibacterial agents, their potential use in medicine seems invaluable. Nowadays, as contemporary medicine is facing the tremendous problem of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, bacteriophage therapy seems to present an interesting alternative to this popular form of medication. Studies have shown that interactions between bacteriophages and the mammalian immune system may be of great importance. Bacteriophages may play a significant role in clinical transplantation as they reduce cellular infiltration of allogenic skin allografts, which was observed in mice [1]. They are believed to have immunomodulatory properties [2]; they inhibit the adhesion of platelets and, to some extent, T cells to fibrinogen, a protein which plays an important role in transplant rejection, angiogenesis and metastasis [3]. They inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB, which has a positive influence during lung injuries accompanying acute allograft rejections, as observed in rats [1]. Bacteriophages may influence the polyclonal humoral response in mammals in different ways depending on phage type; E. coli and Pseudomonas phages inhibit the antibody production of lymphocytes, while Staphylococcus aureus phages seem to cause its stimulation [3]. They may inhibit the production of (IL)-2, TNF and, to some extent, interferon \u03b3 by human leukocytes stimulated by PHA [4]. However, Kleinschmidt et al. [5] observed an increased level of interferon in mouse blood after injection of T4 phage preparations. Further studies excluded an involvement of the phage protein coat in the observed effect and indicated that viral DNA may be responsible for interferon production. Interestingly, isolated DNA has no such abilities and the phage coat is probably a container, which ensures safe delivery of the molecule in a configuration required to cause such an effect. The fact that bacteriophages may be used as such containers is applied in DNA vaccine technology. The vaccine gene is cloned into the bacteriophage genome and viral particles are injected into the eukaryotic host. Such a vaccine system is more effective than standard techniques, as was observed in mice and rabbits [6\u20138]. The very latest studies show that bacteriophages are also able to inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by granulocytes in the presence of bacteria, which undoubtedly may be beneficial in combating many diseases [9, 10]. They may even be used in anticancer therapies by involving the immune system in destroying tumor tissue cells [11].",

This is confirmed by our findings showing that the HAP1 phage (a substrain of T4 phage defective in the hoc gene) causes a weaker inhibition of human T-cell activation in vitro than its parental strain T4 [1]. Furthermore, while both strains cause inhibition of platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, the effect of T4 is significantly stronger; similarly, the adhesive interactions of T4 with human T cells are more intense than those of HAP1 [3]. These observations are paralleled by in vivo data indicating that there are differences in the antimetastatic activities and clearance of T4 and HAP1 from the murine organism [12\u201314]. Thus, different phage strains could mediate different immunologic affects, which supports our theory of phage-mediated natural immunosuppression [15].",

Interactions between human/animal phagocytes and their pathogenic viruses are therefore well studied. Dendritic cells are crucial for the presentation of viral antigens to T lymphocytes. They are also a source of interferon \u03b1 and induce NKT lymphocyte activity. However, because of their place of abode (skin, mucosa) and their function (transport of antigens to local lymph vessels), dendritic cells are also very efficient carriers for several viruses, such as HIV-1, HIV-2, CMV, Ebola virus and coronavirus. These viruses latch to the DC-SIGN receptor on dendritic cells and enter the lymphatic system. In contrast, measles virus, Herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus infect dendritic cells [11, 16]. Macrophages are believed to be the first targets of HIV infection and they are the major reservoir of virions during all its stages. Although macrophages with HIV particles do not present cytopathic effects, they are a vector for spreading the disease and regulatory centers of infection [17].",

Even T4 phage without the presence of E. coli only slightly influences ROS production by granulocytes in comparison with the PBS group, while HSV virus stimulates it very strongly [9, 10]. Considering the constant presence and increased application of bacterial viruses in human life, it seems obvious that these interactions need to be investigated.",

Probably the earliest data were from the late 1950s and early 1960s and were presented by Kantoch [18, 19], who studied the topic of phage phagocytosis by leukocytes. He indicated that bacteriophages are able to bind leukocytes of the guinea pig. The longer the contact between the cells and bacteriophage particles, the more were the leukocytes that bound to the virions. It is important to mention that the extent of binding was strongly dependent on the proportion of the concentration of the introduced bacteriophage particles to the concentration of leukocytes. It was also a specimen-, environment-, and temperature-dependant process. An increasing number of bound bacteriophages was accompanied by an increasing general number of leukocytes. Interestingly, the number of leukocytes involved in the binding process was relatively small. Furthermore, some portion of the bacteriophages remained unbound despite a long time of contact and an increasing concentration of leukocytes, of which most were unbound. The most important question regarding these observations was whether the bacteriophages only adhered to the leukocyte surface or were absorbed by them. The series of studies indicated that the bacteriophages were adsorbed as well as absorbed by leukocyte cells. These observations were confirmed in in vitro studies in which the percentage of phage particles bound by leukocytes was even higher [18, 19].",

Electron microscope images showed an agglomeration of viral particles around dendritic cells. Moreover, the phages seemed to be trapped in phagolysosomes and devoid of their outer coat during phagocytosis.",

It is responsible for the phagocytosis of 99% of intravenously introduced phages. Phages accumulated in the liver at a 12 times higher titer than in the spleen. At the same time, the rate of phagocytosis of bacteriophages by Kupffer cells was four times faster than by splenic macrophages. This resulted in a more rapid decrease in viral titer detected in the liver than in the spleen [23]. Retention of phages in the spleen may be explained in two ways: the greater phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells than splenic macrophages and the fact that phages are objects of the nondestructive capture of antigens, a mechanism involving Schweigger-Seidel reticulum cells. This allows saving a high titer of phages in the spleen, which makes it a constant source of stimulation of antibody production [24].",

[11] described in 2007 the inhibition of tumor growth by tumor-specific phages, which induced the infiltration of PMNs and the secretion of IL-12 (p70) and interferon \u03b3. Two types of tumor-specific phages were obtained: phages selected by screening phage display libraries and phages expressing an Fab fragment with a previously described specificity for tumor tissue. Tumor specificity resulted in the accumulation of phage particles in tumor tissue. Phages considered foreign agents for the mammalian body are able to induce humoral and cellular responses; therefore localizing phage virions to the site of pathology caused directing the immune response to phage\u2013tumor complexes. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice resulted in regression of tumor growth, prolonged survival of the animals or even complete clearance of tumor cells. Massive infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was observed 24 h after the application of phages, and tumor tissue damage and a small number of viable tumor cells were observed already after 72 h. Induction of Th1 cytokines by the introduced phages was also observed. Although this effect might have been a consequence of the presence of endotoxin in the phage preparation, the studies showed that phages without endotoxins may induce IL-12 and IF-\u03b3 as well. Although the mechanism of the described interactions is still not precisely known, the destruction of tumor tissue may be caused by induced cytokines, which might activate neutrophils to release ROS and other cytotoxic agents, resulting in tissue damage [31]. Although phages can stimulate the production of antibodies specific to them, the described phenomenon seems to have no connection with these kinds of interactions, as previous phage-immunization does not enhance the therapy\u2019s effect.",

It is possible that local dendritic cells may also be involved in the presentation of tumor antigens to T cells. The interactions may then be very complicated. Regardless of the mechanisms and the involvement of phages in immune responses, the role of these viruses seems significant.

Activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) by T4 bacteriophage and their further loading with tumor antigens (TAgs) resulted in the induction of an anti-tumor response in mice bearing MC38 colon carcinoma tumor. Because of the previously mentioned observations related to the inhibition of phagocytosis of molecules in the presence of phages [1], the ability of TAg uptake by DCs after preincubation with phages was also studied. The observations showed that prior contact of phages with dendritic cells had no effect on subsequent antigen uptake. Preincubation of DCs with T4 bacteriophage with or without further loading with TAg resulted in augmentation of maturation marker expression. The contact with phages also caused increased production of interferon \u03b3 by splenocytes. Although the effect was strongest for BM-DC/T4 + TAg groups, it was also observed for cells incubated with bacteriophages only. The anti-tumor effect of phage-activated dendritic cells was studied in vivo. Mice inoculated with tumor cells were injected with BM-DC/T4 + TAg cells. The results were compared with those of control groups in which the cells were activated only with bacteriophage T4 (BM-DC/T4), TAg (BM-DC/TAg) or lipopolysaccharide (BM-DCs/\u201dsolvent\u201d). Treatment resulted in prolonged \u0394TRV (time at which the tumor volume is 1 cm3), which was 19 days in BM-DC/T4+TAg animals, but about 3.5\u20137 days in the other experimental groups. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was also highest in BM-DC/T4 + TAg groups, reaching 76%. Although the mechanisms responsible for the anti-tumor actions are not precisely known, activated DCs are responsible for priming DC8+ T lymphocyte activity connected with T-cell cytotoxicity and the production of interferon \u03b3.

Although bacteriophages are believed to have no natural tropism to mammalian cells, such interactions were observed years ago. In 1940, Bloch et al. [33] proved the ability of bacteriophages to accumulate in tumor tissue. Moreover, they seemed to inhibit tumor growth. The antitumor activity of phages was later confirmed by Dabrowska et al. [13, 14]. A mechanism of those interactions was proposed by Gorski et al. [15]. It involves the potential ability of \u03b23 integrins on the surfaces of some (including cancer) cells to bind the KGD (Lys\u2013Gly\u2013Asp) motif on some phages\u2019 capsids. The models of the studies were the bacteriophages T4 and HAP1 containing the KGD motif in gp24, a pentameric protein occurring on the phages\u2019 heads. The studies confirmed that blocking \u03b23 integrins by ligand analogs inhibits the binding of phages to cancer cells, which seems to confirm the hypothesis. Phages significantly inhibited lung metastasis of B16 melanoma cells (T4 by 47% and HAP1 by 80%) [12]. The increased antitumor activity of HAP1 may be related to the fact that this phage has a damaged Hoc protein, a protein which symmetrically protrudes from the capsid. Removal of this seric barrier and the free exposition of KGD ligand may be the reason for the stronger inhibition of metastasis. Regardless of the mechanisms of action, the involvement of phages in oncology seems very promising.",

However, intensified production of those molecules may result in serious tissue damage and involvement in many disorders. ROS are believed to be responsible for the initiation as well as progression of cancer [34]. They are also considered to be connected with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) [35\u201338]. The pathogenesis of sepsis involves the dysfunction of some immune cells as well as endo- and epithelial cells and is connected with the activity of ROS (also reactive nitrogen species) [39]. The studies showed that bacteriophages can reduce the production of ROS by phagocytes in the presence of bacteria. Phages alone do not cause this. While Przerwa et al. [9] indicated that only homologous phages may inhibit ROS production, Miedzybrodzki et al. [10] showed such ability also for heterologous phages (T4 and the bacterial strain E. coli R4 resistant to T4 infection); however, in this case preincubation with the stimulating bacteria did not enhance the inhibitory effect. Miedzybrodzki et al. observed the inhibitory effect on ROS production in PMNs stimulated by live bacteria as well as by their endotoxins (LPS). The interactions seem to be complex and involve not only phage\u2013phagocyte interaction, but also phage\u2013LPS interaction and bacterial lysis.",

The significance of such interactions may be crucial for the development of bacteriophage therapy, which is undisputed. The recruitment of patients who may undergo such therapy might become less restricted when all aspects of human\u2013phage interactions are strictly known. However, the clinical applications of phages are not limited to phage therapy. Bacteriophages may also be beneficial in transplantation. They may inhibit the activation of allograft-induced T cells and the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which is believed to be strongly related to transplant tolerance [40]. Diminution of NF-\u03baB activity by bacteriophages is an effect opposite to that caused by HSV-1 virus, which was proved to promote activation of this factor [1]. The effect of phage presence on graft infiltration (mononuclear cells and neutrophils) was also studied. Skin transplants removed and examined on days 1\u20133 post-transplant did not reveal any differences between the phage and control groups. However, on subsequent days the intensity of graft infiltration differed in both the analyzed groups. On days 7\u20138 post-transplant, the phages appeared to diminish the infiltration of mostly mononuclear cells, but also partially that of neutrophils. Reducing inflammatory infiltration may be extremely beneficial in preventing graft injury or its loss and may also result in allograft-induced T-cell activation [1].",

            "text": "The constant development of molecular biological techniques may lead to more significant application of bacteriophages than now. Bacteriophages, as objects of intense study, may have a great influence on human life in the future. The phage-display technique, which is based on genetic modifications of phages, allows the display of foreign proteins on their capsids. This method has been successfully used for the development of vaccines with phage capsids as platforms for antigens. Significantly, the creation of a vaccine is not limited by the protein\u2019s size. It is possible to obtain phage particles displaying several kinds of antigens, as was shown by, among others, Sathaliyawala et al. [41] in 2006 for HIV p24, Nef and g41 proteins. These proteins were displayed simultaneously on T4 phages\u2019 capsids deprived of Hoc protein. In vivo studies showed that such vaccines may elicit a strong humoral and cellular immune response [41\u201344]. Because the treatment of animals with these vaccines brought good results and considering the abundant advantages of this technique, it seems an interesting direction for further study. Another application of phage vaccines is anti-cancer immunotherapy. Identified tumour antigens are subsequently displayed on the phage capsid to induce an immunological response. Such a strategy was used, for example, with antigens of 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma. Peptides were displayed on T7 virions and orally applied to mice, inducing a specific immune response. As a result of this response, tumor growth and metastasis were inhibited [45]. The development of anticancer phage-based vaccines seems to be one of the most meaningful applications of phages. The good results of studies conducted so far suggest the necessity of their continuation.",

Modified phages could bind integrin receptors on mammalian cells and penetrate and transduce them; however, they could neither propagate nor induce cell lysis.

Since the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) includes members of fundamental importance in the mammalian immune system, the similarity of its domains and Hoc protein domains may be significant [47]. Moreover, analyses show that many phage peptides more frequently show closer sequence similarity with eukaryotic than with prokaryotic homologs [48], which may be of great importance when considering phage\u2013mammal interactions.",

The inhibition of melanoma cell migration and the resulting inhibition of tumor spread by phages discussed earlier are evidence that this phenomenon may be of great importance. The study of the influence of phages on the metastatic migration of melanoma cells has been continued in our laboratory. Recently, we have also undertaken studies on the influence of phages on the migration of human immune cells, i.e., granulocytes, mononuclear cells and also human leukemia tissue. The studies include the T-family phage preparations investigated previously and also preparations used in the treatment of staphylococcal and pseudomonal infections of patients of our therapy center. We have also studied the biological properties of T-family phage proteins, which in our opinion is extremely important and to our knowledge a pioneering direction of studies. It is important to mention that, because of virion propagation, phage preparations contain some amounts of bacterial endotoxins occurring after bacterial lysis. Complete endotoxin removal from a protein solution was previously described [49]. However, such procedures lead to marked phage loss and may therefore be of limited practical value. LPS is highly immunogenic and its effects on the immune system have to be considered along with the actions of phages. We have observed that bacteriophage T4 preincubated with granulocytes (1 h) caused a slight stimulation of cell migration compared with the PBS group. This effect was, however, stronger than that of LPS and the phages seemed to suppress the inhibiting effect of lipopolysaccharide. Bacteriophage HAP1 caused inhibition of granulocyte migration only slightly more weakly than LPS (data not shown). Considering the great importance of this issue and the sparse (if any) data related to the described interactions, we believe that this direction of study is indispensable.",

Recent studies showed that bacteriophages may pass the intestinal wall by exploiting gut immune cells (enterocytes, M cells and, particularly, dendritic cells) [56]. Interactions with dendritic cells and downregulation of their actions may be significant in preventing inflammation leading to gut injuries. The easy and direct contact with human/animal tissues implies the necessity of a narrow circumscription of all the possible interactions between introduced virions and mammalian cells. One of the most important areas of interest seems to be the immunological system, which is the first target of phage contact. The small amount of data on the interactions of bacteriophages with cells of the mammalian immune system, especially that of humans, in connection with increasing the significance of these viruses in contemporary medicine and biotechnology seems to be a problem. We believe that explaining all the aspects of such interactions and the influence of bacteriophages on the animal/human immune system is indispensable and that this direction of research is pivotal.",
