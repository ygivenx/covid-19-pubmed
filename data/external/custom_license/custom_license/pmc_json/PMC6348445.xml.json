Coulibaly et al. highlight the challenges faced\nby this population in their 2011 Burkina Faso study.9 HIV-positive mothers were advised to attend a 6-week postnatal\nappointment\nat their nearest primary healthcare facility for collection of dried\nblood spot samples from their exposed infants. Qualified sample collection\ntechnicians were often only available once each month, so mothers\nwould have to return to the clinic on that day for testing. Once collected,\nthe dried blood spot samples were sent to district-level hospitals\n(Level 2), which then sent the samples to a reference laboratory (Level\n3). The tertiary laboratory then determined viral load by performing\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HIV genetic material. Test\nresults followed the same circuitous path back to the patients, a\nprocess that could take as long as four months. Additionally, in the\ncase of a positive dried blood spot result, the process had to be\nrepeated in order to validate the original results.9 In contrast, the same high-risk newborns in the United\nStates are screened for HIV at birth with additional tests at 2\u20133\nweeks, 1\u20132 months, and 4\u20136 months.10 For these patients, results are usually available within\n1 or 2 days of sample collection, allowing immediate antiretroviral\ntreatment for HIV-positive children.11 The\nconsequences of diagnostic efficiency versus inefficiency could not\nbe more striking; in the Burkina Faso study, 10% of the HIV-positive\ninfants died before antiretroviral therapy could even be started,\nwhile the early treatment initiated in the U.S. improved infant survival\nby a remarkable 76%.9,12 The stark disparity in response\ntime between these two settings shows just how devastating outcomes\ncan be for patients relying on Level 1 facilities for their healthcare\nneeds.",

However, there are few\ndiagnostic technologies that currently can be deployed in these settings,\nand the lack of appropriate diagnostics in resource-limited settings\ncan lead to tragic outcomes. Fortunately, emerging technologies based\non inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials can be exploited as potential\nsolutions. In this review, we focus on how inorganic chemistry and\nnanomaterials have been utilized in each component of a POC diagnostic\nfor infectious disease detection. Section 2 describes inorganic biomarkers that are\nassociated with infectious diseases and how their properties have\nbeen exploited in diagnostic applications. In section 3, we discuss how coordination chemistry has\nbeen harnessed for sample preparation and protein biomarker enrichment\nfor POC tests. Section 4 details the critical advancements in inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials\nfor signal generation probes that have allowed the field of POC diagnostics\nto rapidly progress. In section 5, we provide an overview of field-deployable instrumentation\nthat incorporates the fundamental inorganic chemistries discussed\nin sections 2\u20134 for POC diagnosis of infectious disease.

The\nbreakdown of one hemoglobin molecule releases four molecules of heme\n(ferriprotoporphyrin IX [Fe(III)PPIX]), which are highly toxic to\nthe parasite.17 As Plasmodium spp. lack functional heme oxygenase activity, the parasites remove\nthe free heme by crystallizing it into insoluble, inert hemozoin crystals.17,18 These crystals accumulate in the parasite over the course of its\nerythrocytic life cycle. After the mature schizont ruptures, hemozoin\nis released into circulation and rapidly taken up by phagocytes.19 The heme detoxification pathway that produces\nhemozoin is crucial for malaria parasite survival; therefore, hemozoin\nindicates the presence of Plasmodia parasites, making it an attractive biomarker for malaria detection.19",

Karl et al.33 first demonstrated\nthat hemozoin could be detected based on decreased T2, though only at parasitemias greater than 10000 parasites/microliter,\nwhich is 2 orders of magnitude greater than the detection limits of\ncommercial rapid diagnostic tests. Several years later, Peng et al.34 and Kong et al.35 developed a low-cost (<$2000), homemade micromagnetic resonance\ndevice for hemozoin-based malaria detection. They reported detection\nlimits less than 10 parasites/microliter using their method and attributed\nthis drastic improvement to the use of ultrashort echo times and a\npremeasurement centrifugation step that pelleted red blood cells from\nwhole blood.34 These discordant conclusions\nled to a reaction by Karl et al.36 and\na response by Peng et al.37 Recently, Gossuin\net al.38 confirmed the results of Karl\net al., indicating that conventional relaxometry alone is insufficient\nfor sensitive malaria detection. These findings led to two hypotheses\nrelated to the superior sensitivity measured by Peng et al.: (1) the\npremeasurement centrifugation of higher-density iRBCs (compared to\nuninfected RBCs) significantly enriched hemozoin in the portion of\nthe pellet measured, and (2) ultrashort echo times may have allowed\nfor probing of other protons, such as macromolecular protons, which\nmay be more susceptible to the presence of hemozoin.38 A simple, low-resource relaxometry-based detection device\nremains to be developed, and such a device would ultimately require\nresources typically not available in primary healthcare settings in\nLMICs (i.e., consistent availability of electricity and clean water).\nHowever, these studies highlight the importance and advantages of\nsample preparation and enrichment steps in the development of sensitive\ninfectious disease diagnostics.",

HRP2 is the most frequently detected\ntarget in malarial rapid diagnostic tests and possesses a unique primary\nstructure containing 35% histidine, making it an ideal histidine-rich\ntarget.101 The authors used biolayer interferometry\n(BLI), an optical biosensor technique, to determine kinetic constants\n(e.g., kon, KD) for the binding\nof the various metals to HRP2. The authors found that Co2+ and Zn2+ exhibited the fastest binding kinetics (highest kon) and the highest HRP2 binding affinity (lowest KD) on BLI biosensors.99 When the same IMAC complexes were incorporated into a loose solid\nphase resin, Zn(II)-NTA resulted in the fastest complete binding of\nHRP2 per mole of divalent metal while also allowing for the most efficient\nelution of HRP2 upon the addition of imidazole. Once a metal had been\nselected, HRP2\u2019s binding and elution behavior was evaluated\nagainst a variety of ligands and solid supports. The selected Zn(II)-IDA\nresin was then integrated into a pipet tip format, enabling direct\nHRP2 capture from spiked lysed blood samples. This field-deployable\nsample isolation and concentration tool displayed up to a 4-fold signal\nenhancement in commercial rapid diagnostic tests (Figure 7). This study99 demonstrated that optimizing the IMAC metal-ligand combination\nfor a particular application is critical for efficient biomarker capture\nand elution; the initial binding cannot be too tight so as to prevent\nbiomarker elution with a competing ligand (e.g., imidazole) nor too\nweak so as to attain suboptimal biomarker enrichment.88,99",

Then, using a specially designed extraction\ncassette and a hand-held magnet, the HRP2-bound particles were guided\nthrough stationary liquid chambers separated by surface-tension valves\nto wash the sample and remove background. Once purified, the magnetic\nbeads with bound HRP2 were transferred to a final 10 \u03bcL elution\nchamber preloaded with imidazole to release the biomarker. This resulted\nin a 10-fold theoretical concentration factor for HRP2 due to the\ntransfer from a 100 \u03bcL blood sample to a 10 \u03bcL elution\nchamber.

The potential\nmanipulation is similar to voltammetric measurements; however, in\nECL, the applied potential also generates an excited state in the\nECL probe, which then produces luminescence upon relaxation.149,165 The canonical probe for ECL-based detection is [Ru(bpy)3]2+, a complex (or derivative thereof) which has been\nused extensively in the development of ECL-based sensors for infectious\ndisease detection.150\u2212154,156 In diagnostic assays, ECL with\n[Ru(bpy)3]2+ occurs primarily through a coreactant\nmechanism, where the coreactant is most commonly n-tripropylamine (TPrA) (Figure 15). In coreactant ECL, simultaneous oxidation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and TPrA\nto oxidized TPrA ([TPrA\u2022]+) is followed by deprotonation\nof [TPrA\u2022]+. An electron is then transferred from\nTPrA\u2022 to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ to form a 3MLCT excited state [Ru(bpy)3]\u20222+ that is analogous to the 3MLCT state that is populated\nthrough absorption of a photon. The triplet excited state then undergoes\nphosphorescent decay to the ground state, allowing for luminescent\ndetection of target biomarkers.149 Of the\nvarious mechanisms for electrogeneration of a luminescent excited\nstate, coreactant ECL has proven to be the most advantageous for the\ndevelopment of diagnostic assays because it permits measurements that\ncan be obtained in aqueous solvents and matrices.",

A biotinylated anti-p24\ndetection antibody and the streptavidin-conjugated fluorescent AgNP\nwere subsequently added to generate a fluorescent signal that correlated\nwith p24 concentration.

Moreover, no cross reactivity was observed in samples\nthat were HIV-negative but HBV- or HCV-positive. The limit of detection\nof the assay was 10 pg/mL, which is an order of magnitude higher than\na previously discussed assay for p24 (section 4.1.2).153 This\ndiscrepancy could be explained by the lack of signal amplification\nin the fluorescent AgNP-based immunoassay.

Several commercial platforms based on these particles\nhave been developed as well, including the Sofia Influenza A+B tests\n(Quidel, Inc.)294\u2212299 and the aQcare Chlamydia TRF test (Medisensor, Inc.),300,301 which have been extensively evaluated in the literature. The high\nsensitivity of these assays is derived not only from the high number\nof Eu3+ chelates embedded in the polymeric nanoparticles\nbut also from the use of time-resolved fluorescence measurements.\nOne of the primary disadvantages of using luminescent probes as labels\nin lateral flow assays is the high autofluorescence of biological\nsamples and assay components occurring at excitation and emission\nwavelengths similar to those of the probes.302 This fluorescence can interfere with lateral flow readings, causing\nhigh background that leads to low-sensitivity measurements. However,\nlanthanide chelates overcome these effects because their fluorescence\nlifetimes are several orders of magnitude longer than conventional\nfluorescent materials (microseconds or milliseconds compared to nanoseconds).278,279 This allows for the use of time-resolved measurements in which samples\nare excited with a pulse of UV light, and emission signal is collected\nafter a time delay on the order of 100 ns for a given time period.284 By delaying the collection of emitted signal,\nthe short-lived autofluorescence from biological and assay components\nis excluded from measurements. While the intensity of the delayed\nluminescence is slightly decayed from the initial signal output of\nthe chelates, these measurements can be cycled to improve signal-to-noise.303 Of course, the unique instrumentation required\nfor time-resolved measurements makes field-deployment technically\nchallenging, though currently available benchtop devices could allow\nfor measurements in district clinics and laboratories. Recently, Paterson\net al.304 developed a promising smartphone-based\nplatform for time-resolved luminescent measurements, which could allow\nfor point-of-care measurements based on Eu3+ chelate particles.\nHowever, the lengthy 100 ms time-delay employed in their device is\nonly compatible with the most persistent luminescent nanophosphors\nsuch as crystalline SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ particles.",

First, the high anti-Stokes shift\nfrom IR to visible does not occur in nature. Thus, the inherent autofluorescence\ntypically associated with biological samples and assay components\ndoes not interfere with UCP measurements. Second, UCP signal is highly\nstable and does not photobleach, allowing for indefinite storage and\nrepetitive analysis of a single test. This is especially useful for\nconfirming field results in a central laboratory.309 Third, assays are easily multiplexed; distinct particles\nabsorb at the same IR excitation energy and emit wavelengths defined\nby the dopant. Finally, optical detection of UCP particles offers\nan inherent boost in analytical sensitivity over visual detection\nof gold; as few as 10\u2013100 UCP particles can be detected at\nthe test line of a lateral flow strip, while approximately 40000 gold\nparticles are needed for visual detection.310 This increase in sensitivity makes UCP particles attractive labels\nfor diagnostic tests employed in surveillance or elimination campaigns\nin resource-limited settings, since they would enable the detection\nof low-intensity or asymptomatic infections.

Another amplification strategy is to generate a greater\nnumber of detectable molecules midassay, thereby increasing the downstream\nsignal output of the assay. In 2002, the Mirkin group461 demonstrated that protein biomarker targets\ncould be detected indirectly in a highly sensitive manner by employing\ngold nanoparticles functionalized with DNA tags. In this strategy,\nmagnetic microparticles functionalized with target-specific antibodies\nwere added to a biological sample. After biomarker capture, the supernatant\nwas removed and intermediate detection elements were added to the\nparticles. These detection elements consisted of gold nanoparticles\nfunctionalized with a low density of target-specific antibodies and\na very high density of double-stranded barcode DNA. Using an external\nmagnet, the gold nanoparticles that bound the target were separated,\nand then the barcode DNA was dehybridized and detected downstream\n(Figure 33).462 Because the number of barcode tags was much\nhigher than the number of captured biomarkers, the resulting signal\nwas amplified when compared to a direct detection method. One powerful\nadvantage of this modular assay format is it could be easily multiplexed,\nwith distinct barcode tags for each target of interest.463 Further, while the biobarcode method was initially\napplied to the detection of proteins, it has also been applied to\nnucleic acid detection. Simply replacing the biomarker-specific antibodies\nwith DNA complementary to the nucleic acid target allows for detection\nof DNA or RNA targets with PCR-like sensitivity.464",

Their strategy employed a magnetic\nbead-conjugated aptamer specific for the biomarker of interest.

In biomarker-containing\nsamples, the aptamer bound to the biomarker, releasing the invertase-conjugated\ncomplementary DNA into solution.

Mobile health technologies (i.e., mobile phones and\ntelemedicine) augment these advances in instrumentation, connecting\nindividual users to an entire healthcare infrastructure. Mobile health\ntechnologies are useful for tracking patient information and facilitating\ncommunication between the patient and the care provider. As these\ntechnologies mature, they are becoming increasingly important for\nmodeling diseases and disease trends throughout various populations.563 Integration of portable electrochemical diagnostics\nwith mobile health technologies in so-called \u201cconnected\u201d\ndiagnostics has been pursued by interfacing electrochemical devices\nwith mobile phones.173,564 Nemiroski and colleagues173 developed a universal mobile electrochemical\ndetector (uMED) that combined a potentiostat with virtually any mobile\nphone using audio-based data transmission (Figure 37B). The device could accommodate several\nelectrochemical techniques (amperometry, coulometry, voltammetry,\nand potentiometry), and the voice system-based data ensured broad\ncompatibility with a variety of mobile phones and networks. The authors\nemployed the uMED to detect blood glucose, heavy metals in water,\nelectrolytes, and malarial biomarker HRP2. Following sample collection\nand measurement using the potentiostat, the user placed a phone call\nto a Skype number in a remote location to vocally report the value\nof the analyte measured. The remote application then extracted the\nvalue from the audio data and sent an SMS message back to the user\nwith additional diagnostic information (e.g., \u201cLOW\u201d\nif the reported blood glucose level was low). Although the uMED was\napplied to detect an infectious disease biomarker (HRP2), it is limited\nby the availability of existing compatible testing technology. For\ninstance, HRP2 detection required an offline 96-well plate ELISA to\nbe conducted prior to analysis on the uMED and transmission over a\nmobile network. As more progress is made in electrochemical diagnostic\ndesign, the uMED and other similar devices will be able to reach their\nfull potential as \u201cconnected\u201d diagnostics.",

Hemin was then\nadded, which bound to the G-quadruplex, forming a DNAzyme that could\ncatalyze the reduction of H2O2. This reduction\nproduced a current that was proportional to IFN-\u03b3 concentration\nin the sample. Adapted with permission from ref (144). Copyright 2012 Royal\nSociety of Chemistry.",
