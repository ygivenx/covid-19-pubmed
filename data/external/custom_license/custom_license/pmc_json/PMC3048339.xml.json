It is implicated in about 40% of time lost from employment and 30% of time lost from education.1 Most adults contract two to four colds per year, whereas children can have as many as 10 colds per year, producing substantial expenditure for physician office visits and over-the-counter cold and cough remedies.1,2 The infection is self-limiting. It usually resolves within 7 days, but many colds persist for up to 3 weeks and are due to various viruses. Although it is known that rhinovirus infections cause 10%\u201340% of colds,1 with coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, echovirus, and coxsackie virus accounting for the remainder of cases,3,4 these viruses produce clinically indistinguishable disease,5,6 making specific viral diagnosis difficult. Available remedies act only to alleviate the cold symptoms (sneezing, nasal stuffiness and discharge, sore or scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, headache, fever, and myalgia) and have no true therapeutic benefit toward eliminating the viral challenge.2,7,8",

They are commonly used to treat viral upper respiratory tract infections.11 Echinacea causes an increase in numbers of circulating white blood cells, activation of phagocytosis by human granulocytes, and elevation of body temperature,12 resulting primarily from the aerial portion of E. purpurea13 and the root portion of E. pallida.13 Previous research suggests that Echinacea may be most effective at reducing the severity and duration of the common cold when taken early in the illness14,15 but has little to no preventive benefit.16 A review of five randomized, clinical trials investigating the immunomodulatory activity of Echinacea concluded that Echinacea may be an efficacious immune stimulator.17",

The randomization list and the drug codes were locked in sealed envelopes until the end of the follow-up period, final assessment, and statistical analysis. Each patient was given a similar pack of 30 capsules and was asked to swallow one capsule twice daily for as long as he/she had cold symptoms. The first capsule was administered just after enrollment at the clinic to assess initial tolerability. Participants were asked to take no other cold preparations during the study period apart from acetaminophen for symptomatic relief of pain or fever on an as-needed basis. Oral thermometers were given to the patients at the time of enrollment. All patients were asked to revisit at day 1 after the start of treatment and within 1 day of noting that their cold symptoms had resolved. At this visit, they returned unused capsules so that adherence to the protocol could be checked through capsule counts and the treating physician could confirm that cold symptoms had resolved.",
