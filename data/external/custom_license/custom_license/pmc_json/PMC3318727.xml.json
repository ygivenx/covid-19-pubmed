PIs can be tightly regulated both spatially\nand temporally by the many PI kinases and phosphatases that are distributed\nthroughout the different intracellular compartments (1). The potential roles for PIs and PI kinases in the life cycle of\nviruses have been studied extensively. For example, PI3Ks appear to play a\npredominant role in regulating Ebola virus entry (2). Several other viruses also activate PI3K during infection, such as\nVSV and influenza virus (3, 4). In addition, several groups identified PI4KA\nas a cofactor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (5\u20137). The HCV\nnonstructural protein NS5A was demonstrated to interact with PI4KA and stimulate its\nkinase activity (8, 9). Recently, PI4KB was shown to be a key cellular protein\nexploited by several plus-strand RNA viruses for replication, and the PI4P-rich\nlipid microenvironment is essential for enteroviral RNA replication (10).",

SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-strand\nRNA virus. Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor of\nSARS-CoV, which is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV entry into host cells (12, 13).\nUnderstanding the molecular basis by which SARS-CoV targets cells has been critical\nto unraveling the mechanisms of its pathogenesis. SARS-CoV enters cells by direct\nfusion at the plasma membrane (14\u201316). Further studies\nprimarily using pseudotyped virus systems have shown that SARS-CoV entry is\npH-dependent and have suggested that the endosome protease cathepsin L may be\ninvolved in entry (17\u201319). Apart from these observations, no other\nkey cellular factors have been shown to be specifically involved in the SARS-CoV\nlife cycle.",

To our knowledge, the\nfunctions of PI4Ks in mammalian cells have not been well defined. In\nthis study, we sought to identify the type of PI kinase that was\naffected by LY294002 and wortmannin. Given that p85\u03b1 is the\nmajor and most important subunit among the PI3K subunits (24), this subunit was assessed in\nthe following experiments. We designed a series of corresponding siRNAs\nto test the effect of knocking down each individual gene on virus entry\nwithout significant effects on cell viability (Table 1). Quantitative RT-PCR results demonstrated\nthat the siRNAs we used efficiently inhibited target gene expression\n(PI3KR1, PI4KA, and PI4KB), whereas the control siRNA had little effect\n(Fig. 2A).\nFluorescence microscopy showed a significant inhibition of SARS-CoV\nS-mediated entry only after PI4KB siRNA transfection compared with\ncontrol siRNA-treated cells, whereas the PI4KA knockdown had no\nsignificant effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. Conversely, SARS-CoV\nS-mediated entry increased after transfection of PI3KR1 (p85\u03b1)\nsiRNA into VeroE6 cells (Fig.\n2B). In contrast, PI kinase siRNAs had no\neffect on VSV-G entry into VeroE6 cells (Fig. 2B). Statistical analysis demonstrated\nthe significance of the above observation (Fig. 2C). PI4KB silencing by three\nindividual siRNA duplexes strongly inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry,\nas confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D). Moreover, siRNA duplex 2 was the\nmost potent for both PI4KB transcript silencing and for the inhibition\nof SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. From these results, we conclude that\nLY294002 and wortmannin inhibit SARS pseudovirus entry by targeting\nPI4KB and that PI4KB is involved in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry into\nVeroE6 cells.",

Previous\nstudies have established that PI4KB is responsible for the production of\nmost of the PI4P present in cells (25), whereas PI3K can convert PI4P into phosphatidylinositol\n3,4-bisphosphate, thereby decreasing PI4P concentrations (26). These previous results suggest\nthat the level of PI4P may be the main reason that PI3KR1 and PI4KB\ndemonstrate different functions in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. To\ninvestigate whether kinase activity could account for the different\neffects of the PI kinases on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry and to test\nwhether PI4P lipids directly regulate viral entry independent of PI4KB,\nVeroE6 cells were transiently transfected with the SAC1\ngene, a PI phosphatase that specifically converts PI4P lipids back to PI\n(27). This phosphatase has\nbeen shown to oppose PI4KB in vivo.

However, most PI4P immunofluorescence was lost after a\n30-min treatment with LY294002 (Fig.\n4A, right panel). Additionally, the\nreduction of PI4KB by siRNA knockdown greatly affected PI4P levels in\nVeroE6 cells (Fig.\n4B). In parallel, lipid extracts were\nprepared from siRNA-transfected cells and probed for PI4P content using\nPI4P mass strips that contained known loading standards. As shown, PI4KB\ninhibition had a greater effect on lowering PI4P levels in VeroE6 cells\ncompared with PI4KA inhibition, whereas PI3KR1 inhibition increased the\nlevel of PI4P (Fig. 4,\nC and D). The effect of PI3KR1,\nPI4KA, and PI4KB on PI4P levels in VeroE6 cells was in accordance with\ntheir effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. These results suggest that\nPI4KB is responsible for most of the production of PI4P. Next, we\nmonitored the effect of recombinant Sac1 expression on PI4P levels.\nVeroE6 cells were transiently transfected with a FLAG-Sac1 expression\nplasmid. Transfected cells (Fig. 4,\nred) were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence\nusing an anti-FLAG antibody, and PI4P (green) was\ndetected with an anti-PI4P antibody. Confocal images show that PI4P\nlevels in FLAG-Sac1-positive cells were lower than in nontransfected\ncells (Fig. 4E).\nDetection of PI4P from lipid extracts of VeroE6 cells that were\ntransfected with FLAG-Sac1 or a control plasmid revealed that ectopic\nexpression of Sac1 reduced the levels of PI4P in VeroE6 (Fig. 4, F and\nG).

The\nprimary step is often initiated by low affinity binding to attachment\nsites, which promotes the concentration of virions on the cell surface.\nThe subsequent binding to a high affinity receptor triggers cell entry\n(28). After virus binding,\nthe entry of enveloped viruses into cells is known to occur via two\nprimary pathways, membrane fusion or endocytosis (29). To determine whether PI4KB facilitates\nSARS-CoV entry via several stages or via one specific stage, the ACE2\nprotein on the cell surface was characterized by FACS. After siRNA\ntransfection with control siRNA or PI kinase siRNA for 48 h, the\nfluorescence from ACE2 on the cell surface did not decrease compared\nwith the control group, irrespective of the siRNA that was transfected\n(Fig. 5A),\nindicating that the level of cell surface ACE2 remained constant. In\naddition, total ACE2 protein levels in cells were not affected by the\ninhibition of PI kinases, although the synthesis of the PI4KB protein\nwas severely inhibited after transfection of PI4KB siRNA (Fig. 5B). In\naddition, we compared the binding of increasing quantities of a\nrecombinant SARS-CoV RBR (S318\u2013510) to siRNA-treated cells.\nConsistent with the above results, there was no significant difference\nin RBR binding between control siRNA cells or those treated with PI\nkinase siRNAs (Fig.\n5C). To confirm these results, the binding\nof SARS-CoV S to VeroE6 cells was quantified by Western blot analysis.\nEquivalent pseudovirus binding was observed in DMSO-, LY294002- or\nwortmannin-treated VeroE6 cells at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we detected\nequivalent quantities of internalized SARS-CoV pseudovirions in VeroE6\ncells at 37 \u00b0C before and after LY294002 or wortmannin treatment\n(Fig. 5D). The\nassociation of SARS-CoV S with cells was specific because neutralizing\nantibody treatment against SARS coronavirus spike protein almost\ncompletely inhibited SARS-CoV S binding and internalization (Fig. 5D).

Recently, the independent functions of the PI4P lipids, the most abundant\nmonophosphorylated inositol phospholipids in mammalian cells, have been described,\nshowing that PI4P lipids can alter local membrane curvature and regulate selective\nautophagy and endoplasmic reticulum exit site biogenesis (1). In addition, PI4P lipids can specifically bind to some host\nproteins (1). Moreover, the relationship\nbetween phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and PI4P in the lipid microenvironment of a\nvirus is gradually being revealed. For example, both enteroviruses and flaviviruses\nexploit host phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase enzymes and replicate their respective\nviral RNAs on PI4P lipid-enriched membranes (5, 10). More recently, Reiss\net al. (8) found that\nelevated levels of the PI4KA product PI4P, which is detected in HCV-infected\ncultured hepatocytes and liver tissues from chronic hepatitis C patients, exhibited\nenzymatic activity via PI4KA that was critical for HCV replication. HCV NS5A was\nfound to interact with PI4KA and stimulate its kinase activity. In our study, we\nexamined the contradictory roles of PI3KR1 and PI4KB, and we investigated the\nmechanisms of SARS-CoV S-mediated entry to determine that PI4P is an indispensable\nelement for entry. Interestingly, this hypothesis was demonstrated by mimicking a\ndepleted PI4P microenvironment by transiently introducing Sac1 into VeroE6 cells.\nHowever, it is still not clear whether other RNA viruses, in addition to SARS-CoV,\nshare similar intracellular molecular events that are important for viral entry.",
