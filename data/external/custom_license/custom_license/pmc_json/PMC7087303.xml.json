            "text": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) pandemic has become a major public health concern, with such increasing prevalence that nearly 200 million individuals are infected worldwide [1]. The majority of acute HCV infections present an asymptomatic course. Many infected individuals are therefore not seen in a medical setting [28]. Nearly 85% of infected people develop persistent infection and are at risk of long-term complications, ranging from mild liver damage to severe chronic hepatitis that can develop into cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinomas [3]. Therefore, a rapid and accurate diagnosis of HCV is important for the prevention of viral transmission and management of disease progression. Screening of antibodies against HCV, however, is not a reliable method of diagnosing acute HCV infection, since the appearance of antibodies against HCV can be delayed in up to 30% of patients at the onset of symptoms [23]. Moreover, the window period can be even longer in immunocompromised patients, who need to be screened routinely for HCV viremia [21].",

A variety of molecular diagnostic assays, such as reverse transcriptase PCR [12], nucleic-acid-sequence-based amplification [13], transcription-mediated amplification [29], branched-chain DNA assay [26], and in-house real-time PCR [8], have been developed for the detection of HCV RNA. These assays, whether qualitative or quantitative, are relatively time-consuming, labor-intensive, and dependent on specialized equipment. In resource-limited or point-of-care settings, the cost and technology requirement limit their universal application. Since most HCV-infected individuals are asymptomatic, there are clear advantages to targeted screening for HCV in those who are at high risk. Earlier detection of infection results in earlier treatment and thus earlier recovery [25]. For this reason, there is still a great need for a tool to simplify the detection of HCV RNA with acceptable sensitivity and specificity, short turnaround time, and cost-effectiveness.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel rapid, accurate, and economical nucleic acid test [19]. The method is characterized by employing a DNA polymerase with strand-displacement activity, along with two inner primers (FIP, BIP) and two outer primers (F3, B3) to form auto-cycling immediates. Loop primers (LF, LB), first described by Nagamine et al, could accelerate and enhance the sensitivity of the LAMP assay [21]. One-step LAMP assays have been successfully applied to the rapid detection of a number of RNA viruses, such as influenza virus [16], mumps virus [31], West Nile virus [24], severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus [15], and HIV-1 [7]. LAMP assays have also been developed to detect hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis B virus [5], hepatitis A virus, and hepatitis E virus [15]. At present, however, no HCV detection assay using this method has been reported. The attributes of the HCV target may interfere in complex ways with the LAMP method. For instance, although the viral 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) is thought to be the most conserved portion of the HCV genome and is targeted by almost all of the commercial and in-house tests [9], one of the most important issues may be the existence of complex secondary structure across all of this region (Fig. 1B). Also, the 5\u2032-UTR is generally considered to be variable enough to distinguish all of the major types and many subtypes of HCV [14].\n",

The HCV genotype 1b sequence (GenBank accession number AY460204), chosen as a representative strain, was used as a reference for generating the set of primers. All of the primers, including two outer (F3 and B3), two inner (FIP and BIP) and two loop primers (LF and LB), were designed according to the guideline provided by PrimerExplorer V4 (http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/). In this set, FIP consisted of F1c, complementary to the F1 sequence, and F2 sequence, and BIP consisted of the B1 sequence and B2c, complementary to the B2 sequence. F3 and B3 were located outside F2 and B2, while the loop primers recognized the region between F2 and F1, or B2 and B1. To strengthen the power of LAMP, an additional accelerating primer (AP), located between F1 and B1, was added to the primer set. A schematic representation of the locations of the primers along with a representative alignment of the main HCV strains is shown in Fig. 1. The details of the oligonucleotide primers used for the amplification are given in Table 1. All primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China).\n",

A dumbbell-like intermediate is the initial auto-cycling product for the subsequent amplification steps in the LAMP assay. Apart from the classical LAMP pathway that is followed when using FIP and BIP, as described elsewhere [22], the AP pathway involves the synthesis via AP priming to promote elongation followed by FIP self-priming. The characteristic feature of the products of the AP pathway is that the end products are partly derived from the concatenation of AP-FIP fragments (Fig. 5). More importantly, if the AP pathway is followed in the assay, it is logical to speculate that the amplification would still occur without the outer primer (named AP-B3 LAMP in this study), which is strictly required in the classical LAMP [22]. Three LAMP formats are shown in Fig. 5A. To test this hypothesis, we compared the Pre-LAMP, AP-LAMP, and AP-B3 LAMP assays using the same templates.\n",

The adaptation of the LAMP technology for HCV detection in point-of-care or resource-limited setting has many potential advantages. For examples, the reaction occurs under isothermal conditions and thus does not require special equipment. The powerful amplification efficiency of the LAMP assay makes it extremely rapid, and it exhibits high analytical sensitivity. Furthermore, the end product can be observed immediately by visual observation, through turbidity or dye staining [27]. Up to now, however, no HCV nucleic acid test has been available outside of the laboratory setting, possibly due to time, cost and technology limitations.",

We devised an accelerating primer to improve the efficiency of amplification. Just like the loop primer in LAMP, the AP provides an additional starting site for DNA synthesis (Fig. 5) during the amplification, thereby reducing the overall reaction time and increasing the sensitivity. It should be mentioned, however, that in the LAMP reaction, the loop region is always in a single-stranded state during the process. In contrast, the AP is located in the double-stranded region and is complementary to one of its strands. When comparing the performance of the AP-LAMP and Pre-LAMP assays, higher amplification efficiency was found in the former. A possible explanation for this is that apart from the classical amplification process in LAMP assay, there is an AP-based amplification pathway in the AP-LAMP method. This notion is supported by the following evidence: First, by comparing the band patterns of AP-LAMP and Pre-LAMP, the products of the AP pathway (AP-FIP) were observed in the former. Next, the AP-B3 LAMP assay still amplified the target in the absence of outer primer B3. In the classical LAMP format, the outer primer is important for strand displacement to form an auto-cycling intermediate product. No amplification occurs without this primer [2]. Finally, by the digesting the end products with restriction enzymes that recognize different sites in the target, the most favorable structure of the amplified products was found by length polymorphism analysis, as shown in Fig. 3.",

Since LAMP reaction efficiency and sensitivity strongly depend on primer selection, a more flexible way for LAMP primer design could promote the use of this method. Summing up the above points, the AP strategy could be applied in LAMP design to meet special demands under certain conditions. For instance, because both ends of the FIP/BIP secondary structure play a key role in amplification cycling in the LAMP-based assay, using an AP could reduce the problem of selecting FIP/BIP. Adding AP to the pre-optimized LAMP assay could avoid the need to design different primer sets for optimization.",

Although this method is essentially qualitative at the outset, the sensitivity limits represent good performance, since the HCV plasma viremia in acute infections is generally higher than 104 copies/ml [11].

Since the samples comprised the HCV genotypes 1b, 2a, which are prevalent in China [17], this AP-LAMP assay is expected to work for the majority of HCV-infected individuals in the local region. Because of the high mutation rate of the HCV 5\u2019UTR, it is not easy to generate a single LAMP primer set to detect every viral strain of an individual subtype. Degenerate design is most the common way to address the issue of genotype inclusivity, but this may lower the diagnostic sensitivity due to a hybridization effect. For this reason, the AP strategy developed here would potentially be applicable in a situation like this. Future evaluation of detection efficiency using an extensive collection of HCV genotypes and larger samples would be desired to validate the performance of the assay.",

Our results, as well as the results of previous studies using a fluorescent reagent to detect the LAMP product visually [24, 35], showed a similar detection efficiency when compared to real-time PCR or electrophoresis.
