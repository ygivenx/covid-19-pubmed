The critical role of public health, in the\ncontext of disease surveillance is recognized by these regulations, with\nrecommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). ELR refers to the\nelectronic transmission of labs related to reportable conditions to public health\n[4]. The emphasis on interoperability in\nrecent legislations [5] and roadmaps [6] is facilitating the focus on electronic\nmovement of data across healthcare settings. Many public health agencies have seen a\ntrend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another\nlayer of complexity to interoperability efforts. Given this landscape, it is\nessential to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on quality of\ndata being transmitted, as this is a crucial step in interoperability. In addition,\nthis holds broad implications for future priority transactions such as electronic\ncase reporting to public health.",
