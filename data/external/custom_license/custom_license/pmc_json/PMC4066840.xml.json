The virus had previously been reported to circulate in Brazilian children.\n5\n, \n14\n, \n15\n The prevalence reported in the original study from Allander et al. was 3\u00b75% in hospitalized patients in Sweden. Additional studies, mostly among hospitalized children and infants with respiratory infections, have identified prevalence proportions ranging from 1\u00b75% to 19% in different regions.\n11\n, \n16\n, \n17\n The different values reported from these studies may be because of sampling techniques, study populations and the sensitivity of the diagnostic assay.\n18\n The prevalence of infection detected in our study in Argentina is consistent with these findings. However, the prevalence rates that we identified in Nicaragua and Peru are higher than have been previously reported for this virus. The reason why these two sites have higher prevalence rates may be related to the circulation of the virus in these areas caused by appropriate environmental conditions (susceptible population, climate, geography, migration, etc.) that may also favor persistent infection as has been reported in other studies.\n19\n Despite the difference in prevalence rates among the three sites, the age and gender distribution of our samples are similar and comparable to other studies with a peak in HBoV infection in children 1 year of age and a slight increase in detection among boys. In our study, as in previous studies, HBoV has been identified as a co\u2010infecting agent in a high proportion (ranging from 9\u00b75% to 83\u00b70%) of respiratory illnesses.\n4\n, \n6\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n\n",

However, we were unable to detect an agent in 49\u00b70% of the samples, and we did not test for some known respiratory viruses, such as human rhinovirus, coronavirus or for bacterial agents. Previous studies have shown that upper respiratory infections among children may be caused by a variety of viral agents and very frequently occur as co\u2010infections\n24\n, \n25\n, and this may be the case for these HBoV\u2010positive samples. Furthermore, additional studies have detected HBoV in fecal samples of patients with both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms\n12\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, and in Brazil, there was evidence of infection in children with only symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, no respiratory symptoms.\n14\n This may suggest an alternative transmission route for the virus and its pathogenic role in the gastrointestinal tract.
