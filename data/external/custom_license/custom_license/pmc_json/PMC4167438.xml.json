            "text": "Salmonella are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe, motile and rod-shaped bacteria comprised of three species, S. enterica, S. bongori and S. subterranean. However, many different serovars have been described for S. enterica including the major contributors to salmonella infections in humans, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhi, S. Typhimurium, S. Paratyphi, and S. Choleraesuis. While S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi cause typhoid fever, S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium lead to gastrointestinal infections termed salmonellosis [1]. In the European Union alone, approximately 100.000 human cases of salmonellosis are reported annually, with S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium the most frequently detected serotypes (EFSA, 2013). These non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) cause a localized infection manifesting as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. The infection dose is approximately 105 bacteria and the disease is mainly self-limiting with mild symptoms [2]. However, in immunocompromised people and young children the severity of the disease may be more pronounced including typhoid-like infections potentially leading to systemic infections and sepsis [3]. While several in vivo animal infection models have been used to study the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium [4\u20136], S. Enteritidis has been insufficiently studied. Additionally, evidence suggests that S. Enteritidis requires genes missing in S. Typhimurium [7].",

            "text": "The detection of enteric pathogens relies primarily on standard cultivation techniques. The bacteria are cultured from food or fecal samples and detection comprises pre-enrichment, enrichment, identification of the pathogen and confirmation as mandatory steps, which usually take several days [8]. Although standard cultivation tests are dependable and well-established, the demand for more rapid diagnostic tools is high. Especially during the containment of epidemics, isolation of patients in hospitals, and monitoring of contaminations in food-processing plants time is critical. Therefore, immunoassay-based tests, e.g. ELISA or lateral flow tests deserve consideration. Whereas ELISA is a laboratory-intensive method that takes roughly 4\u20136 h, lateral flow test strips are designed with easy handling and read-out in mind. In fact, immunochromogenic strips (ICS) based on lateral flow have been successfully introduced in the developing countries to detect Treponema pallidum, the cause for the sexually transmitted infection syphilis, among others [9]. Commonly used ELISA systems are based on a sandwich assay format using Anti-O-H antibodies [10], which detect both the O-antigen (polysaccharide) and the H-antigen (flagella) of salmonella. However, in order to improve sensitivity and specificity for future tests, a deeper understanding of specific salmonella antigens is required.",

The former is a Dehalogenase derivative that provides a covalent, irreversible and highly specific binding to its corresponding ligand [13].

Enterititdis were identified.",

After spotting, the slides were incubated for 1 h at 65 % humidity and room temperature to allow for covalent binding of the fusion constructs to the HaloLink\u2122 surface. Next, the slides were washed three times with PBST (Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline + 0.05 % Tween-20). Afterwards, a 2-well Proplate\u2122 module (http://www.gracebio.com/) was attached to each slide to generate two independent compartments for incubation. Rabbit polyclonal IgG to S. enterica (BP1063P, www.acris-antikoerper.de/) was added to the top chamber with a concentration of 2 \u03bcg mL\u22121 in PBS. The bottom chamber was filled with PBS only.

Within this group nine genes encoding proteins with immunogenic potential were revealed. In spite of that, numerous sequenced clones displayed only gene fragments ranging from 45 to 444 bp resulting in poor and ambiguous identification after BLAST analysis. This might have been caused by the excessive degradation of RNA prior to cDNA synthesis as attributed by a RNA integrity number (RIN) of 2.6. Although comparative studies have shown the RNA isolation method used to be reliable [20], it may have been a source for degradation. Still, this has been a proven method in revealing immunogenic proteins from pathogens and extracting RNA with high quality [11].

            "text": "Nevertheless, normalization of cDNA prior to cloning was successful. Duplex-specific nuclease digests solely double-stranded DNA and has been used for normalization of cDNA prior to RNAseq [23]. This is a mandatory step to reduce the highly abundant rRNA, which encompasses more than 95 % of a total RNA extraction. As no distinct band of 3,000 bp, representing cDNA derived from 23S rRNA, is visible after gel electrophoresis, the cDNA was effectively normalized. Rather, a homogeneous smear, representing cDNA molecules of different sizes, was detected. Contrary to eukaryotic mRNA harboring a poly(A) tail, prokaryotic mRNA lacks this feature and thus cannot be directly reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primers. However, as the applied cDNA synthesis demanded the presence of a poly(A) tail, the total RNA had to be polyadenylated prior to first-strand synthesis. After normalization, cloning commenced by introducing the inserts into linearized vector using ligation-independent-cloning (LIC) [24]. The LIC is a powerful tool in contrast to original cloning methods based upon ligase and restriction endonucleases, which often suffer from low efficiencies [25] caused mainly by short overhangs leading to nonspecific interactions and advocating religation of the vector. In contrast, LIC guarantees directional cloning at any desired site with high efficiency. Furthermore, the proteins of interest were expressed as fusion constructs harboring an N-terminal HaloTag\u00ae. This enabled covalent, irreversible binding to the microarray surface in a highly specific manner. Thus, purification was obsolete and cross-reactivity reduced to a minimum [14]. Commonly, microarray-based immunoscreenings offer high throughput of samples as Zhu, et al., 2006 [26] have shown. However, most methods incorporate time-consuming and costly purification steps prior to spotting purified target protein to nitrocellulose microarrays. The combination of high-throughput microarray-based immunoscreenings and the easy handling of the HaloTag\u00ae system warrants a fast identification of immunogenic proteins [14]. Consequently, the immunoscreenings of 1536 proteins are completed within a few hours.",

Moreover, two hypothetical proteins (SEN1186 and SEN2464) were detected with no known function rendering these candidates highly attractive for further investigations. SEN2464 is additionally described as a methionine tRNA cytidine acetyltransferase providing precise recognition of the AUG codon for elongation-specific methionine tRNA [27]. For SEN4030, a large repetitive protein with 5559 amino acid residues, no function is known; however, it shows high similarity to SiiE of S. Typhimurium. SiiE is a giant non-fimbrial adhesin that facilitates initial interaction to the intestinal epithelium [28]. SEN4030 and the putative isomerase (SEN1504) are conserved in Salmonella [27]. Membrane-association is another intriguing feature as it enhances the protein\u2019s accessibility in a diagnostic assay. This is true for the ais protein (SEN2278), the multidrug resistance protein A (SEN2659) and the membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase A precursor (SEN2832). The ais protein is a lipopolysaccharide core heptose(II)-phosphate phosphatase catalyzing the dephosphorylation of heptose(II) of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide core. On top of that, it has just recently been identified as a virulence factor contributing to enteric infection [29].

However, after initial identification, clones expressing full-length proteins were obtained for all genes except SEN4030. SEN4030 comprises approximately 17,000 bp, so cloning of the full-length gene was not achieved. Consequently, two sequence segments, one in the central region of the gene (6,600\u20138,100 bp = SEN4030a) and another at the C-terminal end (13,500\u201315,500 bp = SEN4030b) of the gene were chosen.

Both parts contain bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains that are mainly found in bacterial surface proteins involved in pathogenicity [30]. The proteins primase and membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase A were excluded from further analyses due to their high homology among bacteria (>30 genera). Identity of the full-length genes was ascertained by sequencing. The expression of correct fusion constructs was determined via SDS-PAGE, see Fig. 1.

SEN1019 scored the highest intensities with a mean of 1.7 in ELISA, followed by both parts of the large repetitive protein SEN4030 (Fig. 2). Indirect ELISA measurements require purified proteins, which are added in a defined amount. During purification the HaloTag\u00ae is cleaved off by a special endonuclease and target proteins are immobilized undirected on the well surface. On the contrary, fusion proteins are subjected directly after lysis without additional purification in microarray experiments thanks to the specific interaction of HaloTag\u00ae and its ligand on the microarray surface. Still, microarray-based immunoscreenings achieved similar results, see Fig. 3. The box-whisker-plot shows the contrast values (n = 12) normalized to the known immunogenic protein FimA, a type-1 fimbriae involved in bacterial attachment to epithelial cells [31]. All mean values were below 1; yet, the endonuclease SEN1019 displayed the highest mean intensity with 0.63. The investigated segments of SEN4030, SEN2659 and SEN2278 displayed intensities ranging from 0.4 to 0.5. Comparing both ELISA and microarray analyses, the normalized intensities differ in the two methods applied. Whereas SEN1019, SEN2659, and both parts of SEN4030 reached normalized intensities above 1, i.e. displaying a higher intensity than the positive reference FimA, in ELISA measurements, the intensities were below 1 in microarray analysis. Despite these differences, both methods show similar tendencies regarding protein candidates with immunodominant character. Additionally, microarray analysis combined results from two different antibodies reactive to S. enterica, while ELISA measurements were performed with one antibody only. Moreover, ELISA measurements represent only one fourth of the data in comparison to microarray analysis. This might have caused the observable variance in the results. Although, some uncertainty remains regarding the specificity of the polyclonal antibodies to the investigated proteins, the use of polyclonal mixtures is a prerequisite for broad initial screenings aiming at identifying novel antigens.",

It is 98.6 % identical to SiiE, yet 76 amino acids are unique. SiiE is part of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 4 (SPI4) encoding for a type I secretion system, which secretes the adhesin SiiE. However, the protein is also partially surface-anchored [32]. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a variety of Ig-like domains and fibronectin (type III) domains. Both domains are found in surface proteins characteristic for protein-protein interactions [33]. 53 bacterial Ig-like domains are required for contact to cell surfaces. Deletion of ten or more bacterial Ig-like domains have been shown to result in a reduced infectivity [28]. The fold is stabilized by Ca2+ binding, which is not essential but still affects SiiE structure and function [34]. As a result of the high sequence similarity the large repetitive protein (SEN4030) of S. Enteritidis can be considered a putative adhesin.",

The method used provides fast and accessible identification of antigens within two weeks starting from cDNA library construction. Furthermore, it allows for the potential illumination of virulence-associated factors, like SEN2278 and SEN4030. These proteins influence pathogenicity in Salmonella and are potential candidates for Salmonella-specific diagnostics. Nevertheless, further analyses characterizing the epitope binding regions and comprehending the gene expression levels, especially during infection, are necessary. Furthermore, determining the affinity and specificity of generated antibodies are essential prior to diagnostic application. Still, as immunogenicity assays on microarrays and ELISA have revealed, four proteins showed prominent immunogenicity. The highest intensity was obtained for the endonuclease (SEN1019), followed by a large repetitive protein (SEN4030), the multidrug resistance protein A (SEN2659), and the ais protein (SEN2278). Membrane-association of the latter three proteins grants an ideal prerequisite for effective point-of care diagnostics. Furthermore, specificity is required for clinical applications, thus Salmonella conserved proteins - the large repetitive protein (SEN4030) and the putative isomerase (SEN1504) \u2013 represent optimal candidates for future endeavors. Consequently, as the large repetitive protein combines these key features it shows the highest probability to be outstandingly relevant for a diagnostic purpose.",
