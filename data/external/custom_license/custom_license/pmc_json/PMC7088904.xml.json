So far, it has been prevailing in many provinces and become one of the most important viral diarrhea diseases in China, resulting in heavy economic losses in swine industry.",

According to an accurate analysis on genome of prevalent PEDVs, we can prevent outbreaks of the PEDV-induced diarrhea more effectively and choose the correct PEDV vaccine strain. By the phylogenetic analysis of the partial spike glycoprotein genes, the Korean PEDV isolates were divided into three groups (G1, G2, G3), which had three subgroups (G1-1, G1-2, G1-3) [9]. Like S glycoprotein gene, M protein gene is also an important component in the phylogenetic analysis of the epidemiological situation of PEDV in the field. On the basis of sequence analysis of M protein gene, Korean PEDV isolates were shown to be different from foreign PEDV strains [10]. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the diversity among the Chinese PEDV isolates and was to find out more prevalent PEDVs in China by the sequence analysis and the phylogenetic relationship of the M protein genes with Chinese PEDV isolates and reference PEDV strains.",

Although PEDV is known to have only one serotype at present, the genome of PEDV is widely to show genetic diversity, according to the analysis results using molecular biological methods [21\u201323]. The M protein genes of four Chinese strains (LJB/03, JS-2004-2, LZC, and QH) have been sequenced and reported. Although the phylogenetic analysis based on M protein gene of LJB/03 was reported [24], it could not reflect the phylogenetic relationship among the PEDV field strains in China. Although the bi-combined attenuated vaccine against TGEV and PEDV infection is authorized to use in swine farms, PED still occurs in the immunized swine herds in China. So it is necessary to further investigate the prevalence status of PEDV based on the phylogenetic analysis of M protein genes of PEDV field strains in China.",

These point mutations may lead to genetic diversity among these isolates. Our findings show that Chinese PEDV isolates are genetically diverse in their M protein genes, both among themselves and as compared with reference strains. The hexamer motif (ATAAAC), which locates at the 5\u2032 end of M protein gene, are conserved among the six isolates. They are identical to those found in the corresponding sites in strains CV777, Br1/87, JMe2, LZC, and QH. The M proteins of six isolates have four hydrophobic domains alternating with short hydrophilic regions in the amino-terminal half of the protein, and the forth hydrophobic domain may has functions as a cleavable signal peptide. In the center of M proteins of six isolates, directly adjacent to the third hydrophobic domain, are also the stretches of eight amino acids (SWWSFNPE) that are well conserved as mentioned by de Haan [12]. The coronavirus M protein is almost invariably glycosylated in its exposed amino-terminal domain. N-linked glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the cotranslational linkage of a large oligosaccharide structure to the polypeptide at asparagine residues within the consensus sequence NXS/T (where X is any amino acid). By prediction, five isolates have two N-linked glycosylation sites except CH/IMT/06 that has one N-link glycosylation site. The M proteins of group1 and 3 coronaviruses and SARS-CoV all contain with only N-linked sugars. The glycosylation status of the MHV M protein was found to influence the ability of the virus to replicate in the liver but not in the brain [25], yet that of PEDV M protein has not been reported.",

Although CH/SHH/06, CH/HNCH/06, CH/IMB/06 were isolated in different provinces, they had identical nucleotide sequences. It showed that the three isolates maybe originated from the same ancestor. CH/HLJH/06 was highly homologous to JS-2004-2, but they were isolated in different provinces at different time. Although CH/IMB/06 and CH/IMT/06 were isolated in the same province, the sequence homology between them was lower. These results indicated that the Chinese PEDV isolates had genetic diversity with respect to the M protein genes. By phylogenetic analysis, the six Chinese PEDV isolates with JS-2004-2 formed a separate group, which excluded European strains, Korean strains, Japanese strain and three Chinese strains (QH, LZC, LJB/03). The phylogenetic relationship indicated that Chinese PEDV isolates were different from foreign PEDV strains and a new genotype PEDV was prevailing in China. We expect to prevent outbreaks of the PEDV-induced diarrhea more effectively, according to choosing the more efficient PEDV vaccine strain by accurate analysis on genome of prevalent PEDVs in China. Moreover, genetic variation existence in M protein genes of Chinese PEDV isolates and more prevalent PEDVs discovery in China will form the basis for further functional exploration of PEDV.",
