Moreover, the existence of immunodominant B cell epitopes and neutralizing antibody responses have also been reported in both human and animals. More recently, Cao and his colleagues found that the levels of SARS-CoV-specific antibody appear to decrease 4 years after the burst of SARS [1, 7, 21].

The diagnosis was further confirmed by serological detection of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies [8]. Ten normal subjects (2 males and 8 females, aged 24\u201352) without any contact history with SARS patients were used as negative controls.

The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of a pool of SARS-CoV-derived peptides including S, M, E and N with or without anti-CD28 mAb. After stimulation for 3 days, the levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the cell cultures were assessed by ELISA. The results in Fig. 1a show that in the absence of stimulation, there was no detectable level of IFN-\u03b3 production. Remarkably, the stimulation of PBMCs from recovered individuals but not from normal donors with SARS-CoV S peptides resulted in significantly high levels of IFN-\u03b3 production (P < 0.01). Similar results were also obtained when the cells were stimulated with SARS-CoV N peptides (P < 0.05). Although the cells that were stimulated with M peptides produced IFN-\u03b3, the level of IFN-\u03b3 production was not significantly different compared to using medium alone (P > 0.05). In addition, no IFN-\u03b3 was detected in SARS-CoV-recovered individuals after stimulation with SARS-CoV E peptides (P > 0.05). Furthermore, no marked difference in the production of IFN-\u03b3 by recovered individuals and healthy donors was observed when the PBMCs were stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin (P > 0.05). The statistical results showed that 66.70, 28.57, 14.29, and 38.10% of the SARS-CoV-recovered individuals tested in this study responded to stimulation by S, M, E, and N peptides, respectively, to produce IFN-\u03b3 (data not shown). Further analysis revealed that 9.52% of SARS-CoV-recovered persons produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to all four peptides, 14.29% to three, 19.05% to two, 28.57% to one, and 28.57% did not respond to any of four peptide antigens (Fig. 1b).\n",

The concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 were variable, depending on the types of SARS-CoV peptides.

The results in Fig. 3a, from five representative individuals (P1, P2, P5, P12 and P20), indicated that no spots were observed when PBMCs were cultured in the absence of stimulation. Patient 1 only responded to N peptides to produce IFN-\u03b3, patient 2 and patient 12 responded to S, M and N but not E peptides, patient 5 responded to S and N peptides, and patient 20 responded to all four peptides. The statistical results in Fig. 3b show that the majority of SARS-recovered individuals responded significantly to S and N peptides compared to medium (P < 0.01). Few of them responded to M and E peptides. Among SARS-CoV-recovered individuals tested in this study, the statistical results showed that 61.90% of them responded to S peptides, 28.57% responded to M, 9.52% responded to E and 33.33% responded to N peptides (data not shown). Further analysis, shown in Fig. 3c, indicated that 4.76% of individuals responded to all four peptides, 9.52% responded to three peptides, 33.33% responded to two peptides, 19.05% responded to one peptide and 33.33% did not respond to any of the four peptides. These results demonstrate that memory T cells from SARS-CoV-recovered individuals in response to SARS-CoV stimulation are heterogeneous.\n",

After incubation for 5\u20136 h, cells were harvested, washed and stained with antibodies to CD4 and CD8 together with the antibodies to cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1. After incubation, cells were washed, acquired by FACS Calibur and analyzed using FlowJo software. The statistical results in Fig. 4a indicate that after stimulation with SARS-CoV S, M, E or N peptides, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressed IFN-\u03b3. Among these, the S peptides induced a markedly higher percentage of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells in the recovered patients than in normal donors (P < 0.05), and the percentage of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells was higher than that of CD4+ T cells when stimulated with all four peptides. In addition, we detected the frequency of IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1-producing memory T cells in SARS-CoV-recovered individuals, and the results in Fig. 4a\u2013d indicate that cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T memory cells (including both IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1-producing cells) were very rare, and there was no significant difference compared to the healthy donors (P > 0.05). In the analysis of multiple functional CD4+ and CD8+ T memory cells, we found that the majority of SARS-CoV S, M, E or N peptide-responding CD8+ T memory cells were IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, and CD4+ T memory cells could produce IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 or TNF-\u03b1, except those from patient 12, after stimulation with S peptides (Fig. 4e). These data indicate that IFN-\u03b3 production was the main property of SARS-CoV-responding CD8+ T cells, whereas CD4+ T cells produced different cytokines but only expressed one of the Th1 cytokines.\n",

After stimulation with antigen, memory CD4+ T cells differentiate into effector cells. According to the cytokine production, CD4+ T cells can be divided into Th1 and Th2 cells. Th1 cells secrete IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 and participate in the cellular immune response. On the other hand, Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 and enhance humoral immune response [9, 14\u201316]. Our previous studies on immune response of SARS-recovered individuals have demonstrated that after natural infection, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are involved in immune responses to SARS-CoV S, M, E and N antigens. Memory CD8+ T cells display an effector memory cell phenotype expressing CD45RO\u2212 CCR7\u2212 CD62L\u2212. In contrast, the majority of IFN-\u03b3+ CD4+ T cells are central memory cells expressing CD45RO+ CCR7+ CD62L\u2212 [12, 13, 19, 20]. The existence of memory T cells in response to SARS-CoV antigens after immunization of mice with DNA vaccine has been described. T cell proliferation, IFN-\u03b3 production, DTH responses and cytotoxic T cell activities as well as the induction of high levels of specific antibodies were also demonstrated in our studies and those of other [3\u20135].",

It has been confirmed recently that Th1 cells producing multiple cytokines are more efficient as effector cells. Single CD4+ IFN-\u03b3-producing cells are more limited in mediating optimal and sustained protection. The factors controlling the quality of Th1 responses seem to be the amount and duration of antigen, the type of antigen-presenting cell and the innate cytokine milieu [2]. In our study, we found that in the absence of antigen, memory T cells can still persist for 4 years in a proportion of SARS-CoV-recovered individuals, but most of the memory Th1 cells and memory CD8+ T cells are single-cytokine-producing cells. This might imply that the memory T cells will ultimately become unresponsive or die. The poor Th1 response could be one of the reasons for the diminished antigen-specific neutralizing antibody production. Therefore, the naturally acquired immune response does not persist for a long period of time and might not provide a protection upon re-exposure to SARS-CoV infection.",
