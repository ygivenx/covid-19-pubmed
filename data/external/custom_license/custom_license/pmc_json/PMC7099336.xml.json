Uncertainties in an era of rapid change in agriculture have led to uncertainty in the capacity to meet growing food needs.

Resilience can be measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system is redefined into a different state (Gunderson 2000). In the case of agriculture and food security, resilience can be considered from the perspective of food availability with a return to a predictable and adequate supply following a disturbance. In this case, disturbances may occur in production (as with the loss of a crop following a plant disease or pest outbreak, severe weather, or climate change), transportation, processing, distribution, and access/supply.",

Although food and agricultural systems are highly managed, they are still guided by ecological principles through provision of essential natural resources, ecological function, and ecosystem services. Just as with natural systems, biodiversity within food systems can be considered across a range of spatial scales from single farms to larger landscapes. Food system diversity also includes social dimensions such as food distribution and access. Sustaining ecosystem function in agricultural activities is essential for sustaining farm livelihoods and the food supply (Tomimatsu et al. 2013).",

In the case of food systems, diversity in farm scale and number, diversity of crops, type of market opportunities, and higher numbers of farms equate to high numbers of species that respond differently to external pressures in ecosystems where diversity provides \u201cinsurance\u201d if one component of the system declines or is lost. To overcome such risks, species with similar traits may be functionally redundant; if a crop is lost because of high disturbance sensitivity (drought or disease, for example), other crops will still provide agricultural product (Mori et al. 2013). Some techniques such as biointensive agriculture which emphasize high biological diversity are most easily adaptable to small acreage. A concern can be about yield loss under such production techniques. However, intensively managed biointensive farms can produce yields which are comparable and often greater than conventional methods, while enhancing ecosystem structure and functions such as biogeochemical cycles and pest population controls.",

            "text": "The contemporary food system is built on a complex network of related activities, ranging from on-farm production to harvest and sale to distribution, processing, and marketing, ending with consumer access, purchase, consumption and resource, and waste recovery. Many related factors including environmental, social, and economic disruptions have the potential to contribute both chronic and acute disturbance to all points in this complex system. It is important to consider resilience at all points in the food system, minimizing vulnerability in each individual sector. Therefore, it is crucial to link the shift in food production systems with a shift in the food distribution mechanisms. Indeed, greater crop diversity offers opportunities for more diverse markets, and a locally embedded network of markets for food sale and access may provide greater resilience by insuring multiple points of entry for sale and access if the system is disrupted. As the two models below, North Carolina Central Piedmont Network and the South Carolina Food Hub demonstrate, decentralized models that link producers to consumers provide opportunities for farmers that utilize high-yield, low input techniques such as biointensive and other agroecological techniques a convenient and reasonable access to markets. Since the techniques can be developed both in urban and rural areas on smaller acreage farms, they can reduce the upfront capitalization costs for a start-up farm and also provide access to food related entrepreneurial opportunities and to food for low-income, ethnically and racially diverse consumers.",

We then discuss two models of food value chains in the Carolinas and how a shift in food distribution mechanisms built on principles of biological diversity can help build food security and community resilience. We also discuss the challenges of establishing such models on the ground and thus offer guidelines for practitioners on how to establish decentralized/local/networked food production, distribution, and access systems.",

Many of these independent farmers are small to mid-sized concentrated animal feeding operations (US Environmental Protection Agency 2015).

Soil is highly managed for fertility and biological activity through an initial deep tillage and frequent carbon and nitrogen additions through green manures and compost. These techniques are often most suitable for small-scale farming and are able to provide product to the local food supply network for sale and distribution.

Of those, 19,563 worked more than 200 days off farm (US Department of Agriculture 2014). For many of these families, small farm operations provide much needed household income to supplement off-farm, low-wage job earnings (US Department of Agriculture 2014). Small farming operations also present economic opportunities for partially- or fully-retired growers, as well as opportunities for beginning producers interested in scaling up to full-time farm businesses. When farmers utilize high-yield, low input techniques such as biointensive and other agroecological methods, farming businesses can be developed in both urban and rural areas, as smaller acreage farms (typically 0.5\u20135 acres) are proving their viability.

Although spending on local foods is difficult to track, CEFS is encouraging North Carolina consumers to spend at least 10 % of their food dollars on locally produced food. The North Carolina 10 % campaign is in the third year of its promotion to bring local foods spending closer to this benchmark. At 10 %, $3.5 billion would be generated for the local economy, increasing opportunities for entrepreneurial jobs, skilled employment, and healthy foods. At the same time, there is a renewed interest in local foods to foster healthier North Carolinians and protect and preserve the rural landscape (Curtis et al. 2010).",

Additionally, underutilized facilities such as convenience stores, restaurants, grocery stores, and local institutions can provide the capacity for storage, post-harvest processing, and/or distribution that can serve as points of entry for people interested in starting non-farm food system enterprises. Retail outlets such as restaurants, small grocers, institutions, and innovative outlets, for example mobile or pop-up markets, can widen the distribution of the local food network increasing access for community members who would not normally be a part of a regional foodshed based only around direct farm-to-consumer marketing.",

            "text": "To achieve this increase in locally sourced food through decentralized, networked distribution channels, three main issues must be addressed.Many of the resources for the promotion of local foods development over the past decade have gone to supporting mid- and larger-scale farms within North Carolina. Large foundations and universities have focused on helping farmers who were affected by the tobacco buyout program transition to other viable crops, as well as the renewed public health focus on obesity, diabetes, and stroke prevention. This led to much public support for getting fresh, local foods into a variety of markets and food access programs. Working with larger farmers and distributors has made a difference in the prevalence of local foods available to consumers. However, small-scale farmers are often not able to sell to these markets.For example, during the 2012\u20132013 school year, the North Carolina Farm to School Program purchased strawberries from only 7 farms and sweet potatoes from 11 farms. For comparison, there are 4155 North Carolina farms of 1\u20139 acres identified in the US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Census, who are also potential suppliers for this program (North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services 2014; US Department of Agriculture 2014). In order to engender greater resilience of the local food system, more attention needs to be paid to the contribution potential for small- and micro-scale farms.Nationally, the local food movement has often been hegemonic in its lack of inclusion of minority participants\u2014be they underrepresented racial, ethnic, class, or genders (Hinrichs 2002; Jarosz 2008). Greater attention paid to the barriers for participation by individuals, businesses, and communities that are not currently part of the local food movement will help in creating greater equity of food access, economic opportunity, and environmental health (Holley 2012). It will also expand the range of products available for production, processing, and purchase, increasing both social and economic resilience within the local network.In the same way that a diversity of scale and market type will strengthen the ecosystem of the local food system in the Piedmont region, greater involvement from a diversity of stakeholders throughout the system will engender more dynamism and resilience (Page 2007; Holley 2012). Expanding and diversifying the community of growers and non-farm entrepreneurs will also expand markets and market access to parts of the community now underserved by a centralized food marketing network.For many small farmers, resources and equipment that would facilitate sale to a network are not available. For example, the cost of an 8 \u00d7 10\u2032 cold storage unit is typically $4000\u2013$10,000. For many farmers who have substantial capital, off-farm income, or access to credit, this is attainable. However, need for capital is a barrier for most low-resource farmers.\n",

Food hubs have operational services which can range from aggregation to distribution and sale, including branding, promotion, packaging, and product storage.

By definition, if such structure and function were to collapse and be unable to reorganize, such a food system lacks resilience, with potentially severe human consequences. However, adaptive capacity and adaptive management acknowledge that a system being managed will always change, so humans can respond by adjusting the system in response to disturbance and changing conditions (Gunderson 2000, 2001, 2002). In the case of agriculture and food security, resilience can be considered from the perspective of food availability with a return to a predictable, dependable, safe supply following disturbance. This issue of the Journal of Environmental Studies and Science grapples with diverse perspectives of this challenge (Marten and Atalan-Helicke 2015).",

Highly managed, low acreage production systems such as the biointensive technique have shown greater yields per unit area than conventional production systems reliant on larger acreage. These highly managed systems also result in more efficient water use, reduced pest/pathogen pressures, and protection of adjacent environments. Interspersing small farms with large farms and returning some lands to a non-farmed condition to provide localized ecosystem services has the potential to engender social, economic, and environmental resilience through regionally-enhanced, responsive, and more highly-integrated food networks.",

However, one barrier to small farmers is often inconvenient access to markets for sale of their products. To have a resilient food system, you have to make it economically viable to farm.

Indeed, several regional food hubs and networks have emerged in the USA that aim to close the gap between producers and consumers. Regional food network and hub models can increase opportunities for direct consumer purchase, or they can serve as aggregation centers for food to be passed into a centralized distribution network, connecting with large volume sellers such as grocery stores, processing facilities, and wholesale distributors. A food system that is predicated upon supporting and cultivating farmers of all scales, who utilize various sustainable production methods for a diversity of crops, and have a variety of market outlets will inevitably be stronger, more resilient, and more adaptable to change than a system that only responds to one scale or type of farmer or one type of market.",
