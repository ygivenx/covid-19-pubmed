In the present\nstudy, we separated the 2C and 4C cells of seminiferous tubules\nin human adult testis by flow cytometry, and identified human\nH-Lse by differential display RT-PCR.

Incubation of red blood cells with sialate\n9-O-acetylesterase rendered the erythrocytes resistant against\nagglutination by influenza C virus [22].
