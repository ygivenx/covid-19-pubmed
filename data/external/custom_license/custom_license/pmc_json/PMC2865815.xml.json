Schiff bases have been reported to possess biological properties[89] apart from antimicrobial activities[10\u201313]. In our previous work[14], it was observed that substitution of 4-phenyl morpholine to quinazoline moiety results in potent analgesic, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. Linezolide also possess a 4-pheny1 morpholine substitution. Moreover morpholine as a substitution in many heterocyclic moieties has been reported to possess analgesic, antiinflammatory[14], central nervous system and antimicrobial activities[15]. In addition, in general nitro/chloro/furan substituted compounds have been reported to possess various biological activities.",

A specified quantity of the medium (40-50\u00b0) containing the compound was poured into a Petri dish to give a depth of 3-4 mm and allowed to solidify. The microorganisms were then streaked on agar plate and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 for 24 and 48 h for bacteria and fungi, respectively. The MIC was considered to be the lowest concentration of the test substance exhibiting no growth of bacteria or fungi. The observed MIC values are presented in Table 4.",
