The clinical spectrum of RSV bronchiolitis in previously healthy infants is extremely variable, ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe respiratory distress and, occasionally, death [2]. The factors determining severity of RSV-associated bronchiolitis have not been clearly established and are still unknown and are likely to be determined by a combination of host and viral factors. Host-derived risk factors associated with severe bronchiolitis include young age (<6 months), premature birth (<35 weeks of gestation), low birth weight, immunodeficiency or immunosuppression status, and congenital heart or chronic lung disease [2\u20134]. In addition single-nucleotide polymorphism in, and expression of, some genes codifying proteins involved especially in the control of innate immune response have been reported as being associated with the RSV disease severity [5\u20137]. On the other hand, the influence of viral factors such as the RSV-RNA levels on determining the bronchiolitis severity is not fully addressed. To this regard, some studies revealed significant association between disease severity and RSV load in nasopharyngeal secretion of infants with primary respiratory tract infection [8\u201311]. In contrast, other failed to found a correlation between bronchiolitis severity and viral load during primary RSV infection [12\u201314].",

In addition, we evaluated the airway innate immune response by measuring the mRNA levels of gene coding for a cytoplasmatic antiviral protein, strongly induced in the lung after interferon (IFN) production or virus challenge [19], namely the IFN stimulated gene 56 (ISG56). We, then, evaluated whether RSV load variations in bronchiolitis severity were correlated to level of ISG56-mRNA and whether viral load tended to be persistent over the course of the disease.",

Differences between infants with RSV as single or dual infection, in terms of the level of viral load, were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney test. Spearman\u2019s rho coefficient was calculated in order to assess the correlation between the level of RSV load and the demographic and clinical parameters, and ISG56-mRNA levels measured in cells collected from NPW. The differences in the number of RSV\u2013positive infants characterized by the presence or absence of retractions and/or nasal flare according to the RSV load levels were evaluated using the chi squared test for trend. Differences in the RSV load between the first and second NPW sample were compared using the Wilcoxon Test. Significance was fixed at the 5% level. The analysis was performed using SPSS v.13.0 for windows.",

Interestingly it has been demonstrated that the nonstructural NS1 and NS2 proteins of RSV appear to antagonize both the cellular antiviral response as well as the induction of IFN transcription [31\u201333]. In addition Ling and coauthors have showed that NS2 inhibited ISG56 promoter activity induced by RNA-activated RIG-I in a dose-dependent manner [34]. However, although RSV has evolved accessory gene products that neutralize or inhibit various steps of the IFN pathway, in our previous study we found a strong and a coordinated induction of IFN stimulated genes in the airway tract of infants with RSV infection [28].

Indeed, considering that infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis have low reported rates of serious bacterial illness [36], we have collected only NPW and not well established respiratory samples such as those from lower respiratory tract, which are likely most suitable for performing isolation and identification of bacteria. In addition, although the marked elevation of C-reactive protein observed in some of the RSV-positive infants could hints to bacterial superinfection, no significance difference in leukocyte count as well as in chest X rays signs was found among infants who have elevated C-reactive protein levels and those with normal C-reactive protein values suggesting that globally there is no concomitant bacterial superinfection (data not shown). Furthermore, recently it has been demonstrated that C-reactive protein levels could be affected by the presence of respiratory viral infection [25].",
