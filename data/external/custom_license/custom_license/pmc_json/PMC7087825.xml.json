            "text": "Acute respiratory disease (ARD) has long been a problem for military populations [1]. Because of crowded living conditions and a stressful working environment, military trainees are at a particularly high risk for respiratory disease epidemics [2, 3]. Studies of young military recruits during the 1950s and 1960s clearly identified adenovirus as the major cause of ARD in the military [4]. Live oral vaccines were subsequently developed and have served as the primary means of controlling adenovirus-induced ARD in the US military since the early 1970s [5]. This has resulted in a 50\u201360% reduction in cases of ARD and a greater than 95% reduction in adenovirus-specific respiratory illness compared with rates seen during the pre-vaccine era [5]. However, the only contemporary manufacturer of these vaccines halted production in 1996, resulting in a resurgence of adenovirus-induced ARD among military recruits undergoing basic training in the US [1]. In a survey of ARD performed at a military training facility in South Korea from October 2004 to May 2005, 43,983 cases of ARD were identified in 460,707 recruit-weeks (rate=9.5 cases per 100 recruit-weeks, unpublished data). Although the high incidence rate of ARD was reported, no epidemiologic data were gathered to ascertain the etiology of ARD. In addition, no system of vaccination against ARD was introduced. Since little is known about ARD in Korean military personnel, a survey was performed of respiratory viruses in military recruits with symptoms of ARD during the four-week basic training period.",

A convenience sample of 200 recruits consisting of approximately 25 recruits arbitrarily selected every two weeks for the investigating period of 16 weeks from the trainees presenting at the medical clinic who met the ARD definition was recruited. After obtaining informed consent, a throat swab was taken via direct observation of the posterior throat and tonsil area using a commercial rigid cotton-tipped swab applicator. The posterior oropharynx was scraped vigorously for 2 to 3 seconds and the swab was immediately placed in a refrigerated cell culture media and stirred. All throat samples (n = 200) were processed for viral isolation in A549 cells (human epidermoid lung carcinoma cells; Diagnostic Hybrids) using standard culture techniques [6\u20138]. Cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine and antibiotics and maintained with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Stocks of each virus isolate were grown in the cells and kept frozen at \u221270\u00b0C for further analysis. Each isolate was used to inoculate confluent monolayers of A549 cells in 75-cm2 plastic flasks. When an extensive cytopathic effect was evident, we harvested three times with frozen and thawing. DNA to be used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was purified by the QIAamp Blood Mini Kit protocol (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The primer pair, ADVF (5\u2032- ATG TGG AAI CAG GCI GTI GAC AG -3\u2032) and ADVR (5\u2032- CGG TGG TGI TTI AAI GGI TTI ACI TTG TCC AT -3\u2032), which created a 458-bp product, was used for PCR diagnosis. All primer sequences are found between base pair position 21 and position 322 in the coding region of the hexon gene. PCR amplifications were carried out in 100-\u03bcl reaction mixtures containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 100 mM, each primer at a concentration of 0.5 mM and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Cosmo GeneTech, Korea). A total of 5 \u03bcl of QIAGEN-eluted DNA was added to each reaction mixture. The reaction tubes were placed in a 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) and were held at 94\u00b0C for 3 min, immediately followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. The final cycle had a prolonged extension time of 5 min [9]. Serotyping of adenovirus isolates was performed by type-specific multiplex PCR using molecular techniques described and validated elsewhere [10, 11]. Human coronavirus (HCoV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus and human bocavirus (HBoV) was detected by PCR or reverse transcription (RT) PCR with RNA and DNA which was directly extracted from throat swabs [12].",

This differs from surveys completed during the prevaccine era indicating serotype 4 to be the predominant strain [5, 13]. The results of our study also differ from a recent report describing a 5-year survey of military recruits at eight training sites throughout the US, in which approximately 95% of the adenoviral isolates were serotype 4 [14]. It is not clear why serotype 7 was predominant in Korean military recruits, differently from serotype 4 in the US military recruits. It is likely that this discrepancy in the predominant serotype could be caused by the prevailing serotype in the general population, since serotype 7 adenovirus is a frequent cause of acute respiratory infections in Korean children [10, 12, 15\u201317].",

However, of 30 positive viral culture specimens from 62 military recruits presenting with ARD at other military training facilities in South Korea, 26 (86.7%) specimens involved adenovirus and all were serotype 7 (Dr. C.-H. Yoon, personal communication). Therefore, it appears that the results do not deviate greatly from the actual situation among South Korean military recruits. Additional PCR work suggests that other viruses were less commonly found in the samples processed. However, we did not test the sensitivity/specificity with known positive and negative samples.",
