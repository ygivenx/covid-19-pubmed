            "text": "Licorice is a popular medicinal plant used in many fields such as flavorings, medicaments, and cosmetics [1]. Glycyrrhizin is the most important triterpene saponin in roots and stolons of Glycyrrhiza (licorice) plant and is a conjugate of two molecules of glucuronic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid aglycone [2]. Glycyrrhizin demonstrates a wide range of pharmacological, antibacterial, hepato-protective [3, 4], antiulcer, anti-allergy [5], and anticancer [6\u20138] activities as well as antiviral function against various DNA and RNA viruses [5] including HIV [9] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus [10]. Biosynthesis of triterpenoids in licorice starts with conversion of two molecules, namely farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and squalene synthase enzyme (SQS) to squalene [11]. Then, oxidosqualene cyclases cause cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene to produce triterpenes and phytosterols [12]. Beta-amyrin synthase is one of the oxidosqualene cyclases, producing beta-amyrin which is responsible for biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin and soyasaponin triterpene saponins [13]. Oxidation of beta-amyrin at C-11 and C-30 positions produces glycyrrhizin, whereas oxidation at C-22 and C-24 positions leads to the production of soyasaponins [14\u201316]. Cytochrome P450s play critical roles in oxidative reactions during biosynthesis of diverse natural plant products. Beta-amyrin 11-oxidase (CYP88D6) is a cytochrome P450 which catalyzes two sequential oxidation steps of beta-amyrin at the position of C-11 to yield 11-oxo-beta-amyrin. Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (CYP93E) is another P450 that catalyzes oxidation reaction of beta-amyrin at C-24 position and is a key initial enzyme in biosynthetic pathway of soyasaponins [15].",

            "text": "Hairy root cultures provide the potential for production of plant secondary metabolite and metabolic engineering by introducing or alteration the expression of specific metabolic pathway genes [17, 18]. These cultures possess genetic and biochemical stability, rapid growth rate, and high capability for synthesis of secondary metabolites at quantities comparable to the original plants [19]. A lot of researches have shown the increase in production of secondary metabolites using gene over-expression in transgenic hairy roots. The metabolic engineering approach increased production of flavonolignans through over-expressing petunia chalcone synthase (chsA) gene in hairy root cultures of Silybum marianum [20]. Over-expression of 7-O-acetyltransferase (SalAT) gene was employed as the target for metabolic engineering in Papaver bracteatum hairy root cultures, which led to the enhancement of morphinan alkaloid production [21]. There are a number of researches which have been successful in producing glycyrrhizin in G. glabra plant in cell and hairy root culture systems [22\u201324]. However, there is only one report on metabolic engineering of glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathways in Glycyrrhiza plants, which uses gene transfer of squalene synthase 1 (SQS1) to enhance glycyrrhizin production in hairy root lines of Glycyrrhiza uralensis [11]. The cDNAs of CYP88D6 have been isolated and cloned from G. glabra [25], which provided the possibility to improve the study of glycyrrhizin pathway via metabolic engineering of G. glabra hairy root cultures.",

This plant was called as the composite due to the presence of transgenic root and non-transgenic aerial part. After growing, the roots were excised from the explants and were sub-cultured on the new MS medium with cefotaxime and kanamycin for transgenic harboring CYP88D6 transgene, and the medium having only cefotaxime for non-transgenic lines.

Due to the high release of phenolic compounds in liquid medium and its negative effects on the growth of roots, activated charcoal was used which had a favorable effect on root growth and also prevented browning of the tissue. Positive effects of activated charcoal on absorbance of toxic compounds including phenols have been previously reported in different plants [34]. Inoculation of plants with Agrobacterium rhizogenesis results in transfer, insertion, and expression of T-DNA from Ri plasmid in the plant genome, which leads to the expression of rolA, rolB, rolC, and rolD genes, as well as producing hairy roots in plants [35]. Another method for producing transgenic roots with A. rhizogenesis is the composite plant. The most important feature of this system is the reduced production time of transgenic root in plants. In addition to having hairy root culture properties, composite plant has other benefits such as the ability to grow in an ex vitro environment, which reduces the cost and time of production and simplifies the procedure [27]. Initially, the main reason for applying the composite plant method was to reduce the time of hairy roots production. On the other hand, the frequency of transgenic root production was 70% in composite plant method, whereas it was 20% in leaf explants. Plant transformation frequency differs significantly according to the source of the explant. The high frequency of hairy root production is related to tissue susceptibility and sensitivity to inoculation with A. rhizogenesis [36, 37].",

The integration of CYP88D6 gene into the hairy root was determined by PCR using CYP88D6-specific primers, showing a 1482-bp band in putative transgenic hairy roots, but not in control samples (Fig. 5). The results indicated that T-DNA from transformed A. rhizogenesis was successfully transferred into the three putative hairy root lines. These three lines had rolB and CYP88D6 transgenes which were named as D1, D2, and D3, while control hairy roots had only rolB transgene which were named HR1 and HR2. If in addition to the Ri plasmid, A. rhizogenesis has a binary vector, the process of co-transformation will occur with two T-DNAs [40].

CYP88D6 expression level showed a 6\u201312 fold induction in D1 transgenic hairy root line, and suppression in two other transgenic lines compared to control hairy roots (Fig. 6). Depending on the integration position of T-DNA into the host genome, different hairy root lines are generated [41]. The differences between various transgenes and control hairy root lines occur as a result of the position effects of transgenes, which lead to differences in gene expression and secondary metabolite production. Following rolB and CYP88D6 integration, there are numerous effects on expression of the transgenes. The main reason for over-expression of CYP88D6 in D1 transgenic line is the existence of constitutive and strong CaMV 35S promoter which results in high levels of transgene expression in hairy roots [42, 43]. The suppression of CYP88D6 expression in D2 and D3 transgenic lines compared to the control can be attributed to many factors such as position effect, gene copy number, gene rearrangement, physiological and epistasis effects, as well as methylation levels [44]. Probably, one of the main reasons for suppression of the gene in two transgenic lines is the existence of a similar copy of the CYP88D6 gene in genome of the hairy roots that resulted in co-suppression of internal and transgene copy of CYP88D6 gene. The CYP93E6 gene was expressed in HR1 line, but was not observed in other control and transgenic lines, which are related to the few amounts of transcript copies in these lines. CYP93E6 expression level showed a fourfold induction in HR1. This gene plays a role in the use of the common beta-amyrin precursor in competition with CYP88D6 gene. Different genes in the T-DNA region of Ri or binary vector are randomly integrated into genome of the hairy roots and alter the genetic content of the hosts, which can further exert a different regulatory effect on the genes involved in production pathway of secondary metabolites [41]. CYP93E6 was expressed in HR1, and the expression of CYP88D6 in this line was twofold more than that of HR2, which might be due to different genetic contents as a result of random integration of rol transgenes into the genome as well as host genetic alterations in HR1 and HR2.\n",

D2 and D3 transgenic lines, having a reduced expression pattern of CYP88D6 compared to the controls, also displayed lower glycyrrhizin production. D1 which had a significant increase in expression of CYP88D6, demonstrated higher glycyrrhizin content in comparison with HR2, but lower than HR1. Failure to increase the amount of glycyrrhizin following over-expression of CYP88D6 in D1 transgenic line compared to HR1 could be due to the lack of downstream gene expression, and hence protein down-regulation. It has been shown that when SQS1 isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis was transferred using Ri under CaMV 35S promoter to licorice, it produced three transgenic lines, two of which showed more glycyrrhizin content, and a lower production was observed in one of transgenic lines in comparison with control hairy root [11]. The putrescine N-methyltransferase (pmt) over-expression in hairy root of two Hyoscyamus species led to a higher level of hyoscyamine and total alkaloid content, but no linear relationship was showed between these metabolites. This could be attributed to the role of other genes contributing to the biosynthetic pathway of tropane alkaloids and consequently its complex regulation [45].\n",

The present study is the first report regarding transfer of beta-amyrin 11-oxidase gene to G. glabra using hairy root system that is an alternative way to improve glycyrrhizin production. It seems that the pathway of glycyrrhizin production is very complicated and needs to examine the entire pathway in terms of the genes expression, enzymes activity, and the amount of intermediate metabolites production. Although the amount of glycyrrhizin increased in one of transgenic lines, in order to increase glycyrrhizin content in most of the lines, transfer of multi-genes of the biosynthetic pathway along with up-stream genes might be necessary so as to increase the primary precursor.",
