The patients had no known contact with other SARS patients, did not have a travel history to SARS-affected areas outside of Canada when the outbreak was thought to be over in Toronto, and were unaware of a simmering outbreak associated with hospital X. Perhaps because of the nonspecific nature of clinical manifestations, SARS can be especially difficult to recognize among patients already hospitalized for other reasons. These symptoms overlap many of the symptoms of hospitalized febrile postoperative patients and patients with other respiratory illnesses (6\u201312). In addition, at the time of this nosocomial outbreak, the full spectrum of the clinical signs and symptoms of SARS had not yet been well characterized (11).",

Such information may have been affected by missing data or recall bias. Our analysis did not include hospital workers, nor did it include persons who were exposed at hospital X but were subsequently admitted elsewhere. Studies that include hospital workers and persons admitted to other hospitals are needed. Seroprevalence studies will be helpful because some infected persons may not be symptomatic. The small sample size limited the power to detect small differences and precluded multivariate analysis. A small number of patients with a diagnosis of SARS may not actually have been infected with SARS-CoV. This possibility could have biased the results either way. However, this number is likely small because most case-patients tested positive for SARS-CoV.",

A sensitive infectious disease surveillance system operated by the infection control officer must be in place in healthcare facilities for early detection and implementation of appropriate measures to interrupt transmission (13,14). This surveillance should include the monitoring of increased absenteeism among healthcare workers; unusual fever or pneumonia clusters among patients, family, visitors, and healthcare workers; pneumonia deaths; and laboratory testing for respiratory pathogens or SARS-CoV. These steps require commitment, preparedness planning, resources, and training. The lack of a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for early SARS infection hampers the ability of clinicians to make a prompt diagnosis in cases when an epidemiologic link is missing (15).",
