            "text": "Stop and go: Influenza researchers ended a yearlong self-imposed moratorium on experiments that enabled transmission of the H5N1 bird flu virus between mammals on 23 January. The stoppage was originally designed to give officials time to review lab-safety requirements following a global controversy over the publication of two scientific papers last year describing gain-of-function mutations that allowed the virus to spread among ferrets via airborne droplets. Many people feared that the accidental or intentional release of a modified virus might trigger a human pandemic. Researchers located in or funded by the US waited several more weeks to resume their work until the country's National Institutes of Health (NIH) gave them the thumbs up to proceed.",

The sequester, which went into effect on 1 March, slowed work on drugs, vaccines and diseases, capped stipends for researchers in training and forced the NIH Clinical Center to admit fewer patients.",

The outcome of the case was a blow to Utah-based Myriad Genetics, which held patents on the BRCA genes linked to increased risks of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Myriad did \u201cnot create anything,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas wrote. The US decision was at odds with that of the Federal Court of Australia, which upheld Myriad's Australian patent claims. That decision is now under appeal.",

Ophthalmologist Masayo Takahashi of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe plans to convert the cells into induced pluripotent stem cells, further transform them into retinal cells and then inject them into the damaged retinas of six patients. The researchers hope to show the cells are safe and don't trigger an immune reaction or form tumors.",
