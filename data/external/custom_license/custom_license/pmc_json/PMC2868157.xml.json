KM91 yielded distinct RFLP patterns in the PCR-RFLP analysis using the restriction enzymes Hae III, Eco RI and Bam HI. For the pathogenicity testing, the isolate KM91 was associated with 50% mortality, severe nephritis and renal urate deposits in the kidneys of infected chicks, whereas the other strains merely caused respiratory distress one to two days after inoculation [21]. The H120 vaccine could not protect the chicks against the challenge with the KM91 isolate [21]. In the RT-PCR-RFLP analysis of the recent IBV isolates, 10 of 15 IBVs produced RFLP patterns corresponding to the IBV KM91 strain [17]. Therefore, IBV KM91 seems to be the major IBV in Korea.",
