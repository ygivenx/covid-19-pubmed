Following automated model building and solvent addition using ARP/wARP32, the structure was refined using PHENIX33. The oligosaccharide moieties of the HBGAs were generated using the SWEET 2 package34 of the Glycosciences.de server (http://www.glycosciences.de) and modeled into the electron density using COOT35 and validated by computing simulated annealing omit maps using PHENIX33. The stereochemistry of the oligosaccharides including the allowed conformational angles was checked using the CARP36 package in the Glycosciences.de server (http://www.glycosciences.de). Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table S2.

The width of the cleft in the P[14] VP8* is narrower (red arrow) than in the Wa VP8* structure (black arrow). c. P[14] VP8* exhibits changes in the amino acid composition and side chain orientations in the region corresponding to Sia binding site of RRV VP8*. The amino acid residues interacting with Sia in the RRV VP8* structure are shown as green sticks, and bound Sia is shown as yellow sticks with oxygen atoms in red. The residues in this region of the P[14] VP8* structure are shown as blue sticks. The residue numbering corresponds to HAL1166 VP8*. The key amino acid changes in this region between P[14] and RRV VP8* are indicated by black arrows. Noticeable is how Y188 in the P[14] VP8* structure causes steric hindrance if Sia were to bind in this region. Also noticeable is the change in side chain orientation of the conserved R101. d. Alignment of HAL1166 VP8* with other VP8* sequences from sialidase-sensitive animal (RRV, CRW-8) strains, and sialidase-insensitive HR (Wa and DS1) strains. The residues that interact with Sia in the animal VP8* as shown in c are indicated by red stars on the top of the sequence. Highly conserved (>80%), and moderately conserved (>60%) regions are colored in dark and lighter blue respectively. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the matching C\u03b1 atoms between the P[14] VP8* and other VP8* structures along with percentage of sequence identity are shown in the table on the right.",

The chemical structure of the A-type trisaccharide (above) and simulated annealing omit difference map (below), contoured at 3\u03c3 level, showing the binding of A-type trisaccharide to P[14] VP8*. Bound A-type trisaccharide (GalNAc: N-acetylgalactosamine; Gal: galactose; Fuc: fucose) is shown in a ball-and-stick representation (yellow) inside the map with its carbon atoms numbered following the standard convention. The nitrogen and the oxygen atoms in the trisaccharide are colored in blue and red, respectively. b. Surface representation of the P[14] VP8* structure (grey) with the bound A-trisaccharide shown in stick representation (with same color scheme as in a). The acetamido group of GalNAc inserts into a well-defined pocket in the VP8* structure. The amino acid residues in the P[14] VP8* which participate in hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with the trisaccharide are indicated in blue. c. Network of hydrogen bond interactions (dashed lines) between the VP8* residues (light blue) and A-type trisaccharide (colored as in a). Participating water molecules are shown as small spheres (cyan). More detailed interactions between VP8* and the ligand are given in Fig. S4. The terminal two saccharide moieties of the A-type tetrasaccharide (GalNAc\u03b11-3(Fuc\u03b11-2)Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) also show similar interactions with the VP8* (Fig. S3).",
