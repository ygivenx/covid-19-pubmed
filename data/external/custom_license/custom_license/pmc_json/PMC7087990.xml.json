At the end of 2015, we enhanced our training on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). The intervention consists of training physicians to increase awareness about MRT, highlighting antimicrobial resistance because of unnecessary antibiotic consumption at ad hoc meetings in each related department.

Then, we performed an observational comparison between the practice in 2015 and 2016. There was a decrease in antibiotic use towards 2016 among all inpatients. However when analyzed separately, a significant reduction in children but not in adults was detected (Table 2). The significant reduction of antibiotic use in children but not in adults could be explained by differences in physicians\u2019 experience in MRT. Despite the fact that there was a reduction in antibiotic use in children after the detection of virus, antibiotic prescription rates were still high. In a recent study, the impact of MRT on antibiotic use was investigated and it was seen that antibiotics were still continued in about 75% of the patients, despite the detection of virus. This finding was explained by being a new test [13]. In another study, Afzal et al. [14] reported that a positive result for MRT decreased antibiotic use duration and prescription rate but the decrease in antibiotic prescription was not statistically significant. Timbrook et al. [15] studied MRT in combination with PCT and concluded that a lower level of PCT and detection of virus by MRT were not associated with decreased use of antibiotics in RTIs, but in another study, a lower level of PCT in combination with detection of virus was found to be associated with shortened duration of antibiotic usage [16]. In a randomized controlled study, the effect of both MRT and PCT on antibiotic use was evaluated and the duration of antibiotic use was found to be decreased in cases of viral infection with lower levels of PCT [17].",
