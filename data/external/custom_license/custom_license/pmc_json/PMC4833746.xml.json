As previously described HBoV3 is the result of HBoV1 and HBoV2 recombination and HBoV4 derived from recombination between HBoV2 and HBoV3. Both recombinations were happened in the entrance area near the NP1 / VP1 junction (5). Some of the nucleotide changes in sequences obtained in this study are similar to other studies, like C168 T and several changes of A to G.",
