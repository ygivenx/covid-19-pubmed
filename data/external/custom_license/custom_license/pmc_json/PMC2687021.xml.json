The alignment was sliced into windows of constant size and fixed overlap and a 100-replicate maximum-likelihood (using HRV-93 as an outgroup) was computed for each window. From each tree, the distance between the candidate recombinant and all other sequences was extracted. This extraction yielded a matrix of distances for each window and for each alignment position. A threshold was defined as the lowest distance plus a fraction (15%) of the difference between the highest and lowest distances. The nearest neighbors of the candidate recombinant were defined as sequences at a distance smaller than this threshold. This distance ensured that the nearest neighbor, as well as any close relative, was always included. Possible recombination breakpoints thus corresponded to changes of nearest neighbors. Serotypes included in this analysis represented serotypes close to CL-013775 and CL-073908 on the basis of 5\u2032-UTR and VP1 phlyogenetic trees (Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1, panels A, B), as well as serotypes close to CL-135587 on the basis of VP1 and 3CD phlyogenetic trees (Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1, panels B, C) and whose full-length sequence was available.",

(13) identified another cluster of viruses (HRV-C\u2032; Figure 1, panel A) and suggested that this group was phylogenetically distinct from all other HRVs on the basis of analysis of their 5\u2032-UTR sequences. To define the phylogeny, we adapted a previously described method (23) to complete the genome sequence directly from our clinical strains (CL-Fnp5 and CL-QJ274218) that showed a similar divergent 5\u2032-UTR (Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1, panel A). A condensed version (Figure 1, panel B) of the phylogenetic tree based on VP1 sequences (Technical Appendix 2 Figure 1, panel B) indicated that CL-Fnp5 clustered with the new HRV-C clade, a finding further confirmed by CL-QJ 274218 partial sequences. This finding supports the view that new HRVs variants described since 2006 (9\u201316) all belong to the same lineage.",

            "text": "EV-104 belongs to the HEV-C species: CV-A19, CV-A22, and CV-A1 are its closest serotypes. These HEV-C subgroup viruses are genetically distinct from all other serotypes of the species. These viruses show no evidence of recombination with other HEV-C strains and, similar to EV-104, do not grow in cell culture (29). On the basis of our epidemiologic data, we conclude that EV-104 was found in 8 children from different regions of Switzerland who had respiratory illnesses such as acute otitis media or pneumonia. Future studies using adapted detection tools will provide more information on the range of this virus. On the basis of its genomic features and similarities with coxsackieviruses and poliovirus, EV-104 could theoretically infect the central nervous system (2,38). Detection of new subtypes of picornaviruses indicates that viruses with new phenotypic traits could emerge, and conclusions on tropism of new strains should be substantiated by extensive experimental or clinical investigations (39).",

Known to be a driving force of enterovirus evolution, rhinovirus recombination among clinical strains has never been observed. Two clinical isolates of 40 viruses analyzed resulted from recombination events and their breakpoints were identified within the 5\u2032-UTR sequence and the N terminus of protein 3C, respectively. These findings are consistent with the fact that recombination breakpoints in picornaviruses are restricted to nonstructural regions of the genome or between the 5\u2032-UTR and the capsid-encoding region (40). Our observations provide new insight on the diversity and ability of rhinovirus to evolve in its natural host. The fact that only 2 of 40 analyzed viruses over a 9-year period were recombinants is suggestive of a lower recombination frequency in rhinoviruses than in other picornaviruses (32,40) and might be related, but not exclusively, to the short duration of rhinovirus infection (18,31,32). Recombination events occurred between HRV-A genotypes, but whether they can occur in species B and C remains unknown. Interspecies recombination is rare in picornaviruses and is mainly the result of in vitro experiments. For rhinoviruses, the different location of cre elements in each species might be an additional limiting constraint (17).",
