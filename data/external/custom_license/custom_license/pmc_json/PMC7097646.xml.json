Wu et al. used a cell-based assay to screen more than 10,000 compounds, all administered at 10 \u03bcM, for inhibition of virus cytopathic effects. From this primary screen, 50 compounds were selected for further analysis, first to determine if the compounds were cytotoxic and second to measure the concentration of the compound required to inhibit virus replication by 50% (EC50).",

Aescin and reserpine, already in use in Europe and the United States, respectively, were also active against SARS-CoV, but neither drug is currently prescribed as an antiviral. Compounds that are structurally similar to reserpine and aescin were also screened, resulting in 10 new anti-SARS active compounds. Finally, a potent inhibitor of the HIV protease, TL-3, which is being developed as a treatment for AIDS in cats, was also effective against the SARS protease. These studies offer new hope for rapidly available SARS therapeutics.",
