Notably, during outpatient follow-up, nasopharyngeal swab screening could only repeatedly detect hMPV in patients with initial co-infection indicated in previous BAL samplings. No fungal or mycobacterial co-infections were detected. No CMV reactivation was present. The findings of BAL fluids are summarized in Table 2. At the time of diagnosis of hMPV infection, cytology in BAL showed predominant macrophages (67 %) and lymphocytes (10 %). It is important to note that patient 1 was in marrow aplasia at the time of BAL, which explains why only a few lymphocytes (6 \u00d7 106/L) were observed (Table 2). For patient 6, BAL was performed for virological diagnosis but, unfortunately, no quantitative differential cell count was done.\n",

However, most of these patients with a poor outcome suffered from hMPV infection which occurred within the first month posttransplant (Table 3). The lack of reports of infections in the later posttransplant period clearly indicates a potential underreporting or underdiagnosis, as only a few centers perform BAL in patients with lower respiratory symptoms. The remarkable better survival in our patients might be due to early diagnosis and the improved \u201cnet state of immunity\u201d.

However, case reports and small case series have described favorable outcomes upon treatment with ribavirin and IVIG [11, 22]. IVIG treatment was given in all our cases, but the amount of hMPV-neutralizing antibodies in IVIG formulations remains unclear. Randomized studies on the hMPV treatment are still missing and will be difficult to perform due to the relatively small case number in single centers. Recommended treatment with ribavirin is based on expert opinion [3, 23], which is supported by data from in vitro cell cultures and mouse models [24]. In our center, we use oral ribavirin in severely immunocompromised patients with hMPV infection. This was well tolerated, except for hemolysis with the need for repetitive RBC transfusions. This needs to be considered as a severe side effect. Hence, a careful analysis of the potential risks and benefits is recommended before making the decision to start ribavirin treatment in selected patients with severe infection. Several other treatment strategies were described in the literature. Patients treated with corticosteroids, aerosolized ribavirin, or oseltamivir did not survive [13, 15\u201319].",
