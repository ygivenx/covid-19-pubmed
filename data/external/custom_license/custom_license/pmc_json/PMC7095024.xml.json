It attracts more than 150 million tourists and business travellers every year. And, because of heavy human traffic and subtropical climate \u2014 compounded by the popularity of live animal markets and a local penchant for wild meat, Guangzhou regularly experiences outbreaks of infectious disease, most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; 2002\u20133), H1N1 influenza (swine flu; 2009) and dengue fever (2014).",

In November 2014, the Zhongshan School of Medicine, part of Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), held its first symposium on dengue fever control using Wolbachia \u2014 a bacterium that infects mosquitoes and stops the dengue virus from replicating. Researchers hope that a collaborative effort between China, Australia and the United States will lead to safe, low-cost and environmentally sound methods for eradicating the disease. Guangzhou will conduct its first field trial of the technique next year.",

Jiepeng Zhang co-authored three articles on metal-organic frameworks, a class of porous composite materials that have wide-ranging applications from catalysis to water decontamination. Chengyong Su and Hsiuyi Chao each published two articles (WFC = 4): Su wrote about metal-organic frameworks for use in gas adsorption, while Chao's were on metal complexes for use in luminescent sensors and cell imaging. \u201cThe school has provided us with great experimental facilities, but the financial support has been limited,\u201d says Chao. \u201cSYSU still has much to learn from the world's top universities.\u201d",

It also has the lowest ratio of AC to FC, indicating that many of its papers are authored by its own scientists. Duanqing Pei, the dean of GIBH, is the most prolific contributor, with six articles on novel techniques for reprogramming somatic cells (WFC = 6). Also notable are Qiang Zhu from GIBH's State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, who published four articles on organic synthesis, and Lingwen Zeng from the Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, also with four articles, on biosensors.",
