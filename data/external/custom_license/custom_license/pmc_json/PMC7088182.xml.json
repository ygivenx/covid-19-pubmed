            "text": "Initially used in micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)-based pressure and acceleration sensors in 1960s, piezoresistive sensors have evolved considerably by the help of the developments in microfabrication techniques and nanotechnology to be of use in numerous modern sensor applications. The structure of piezoresistive sensors is generally cantilever or membrane type, with one or more doped piezoresistor elements inside. The sensors can be used to measure the mass change as well as the surface stress change. The present study will discuss the piezoresistive microcantilever sensors for surface stress studies. The measurement of surface stress variation using microcantilever sensor provides a very high sensitive, rapid and versatile means to study a variety of physical, chemical, biochemical and biological phenomena. The effects can be physical like moisture (Kapa et al. 2008), temperature (Lin et al. 2012) and thin film intrinsic stress (Wen et al. 2012); chemical like atrazine (Suri et al. 2008), explosive vapour sensor (Seena et al. 2011), trimethylamine sensor (Yang et al. 2010); bio-chemical like glucose (Chen et al. 2010), prostate specific antigen (PSA) protein (Lee et al. 2009), and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Yen et al. 2009) and biological like anthrax spores (Fu et al. 2007), severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Velanki and Ji 2006), and bacterial virus T5 (Braun et al. 2004).",

            "text": "The sensitivity of a piezoresistive microcantilever sensor is defined in terms of its ability to convert the surface stress-induced external stimulus into resistance variation in its piezoresistor. The resistance can increase or decrease depending on the combination of the type of mechanical stress, i.e. tensile or compressive, and the transverse and longitudinal coefficients of piezoresistivity of the piezoresistor element. The sensitivity can be improved by cantilever design modification and changing the cantilever material. The cantilever design modifications include stepped and paddled designs (Ansari et al. 2012; Yang and Yin 2007; Mohammed et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2011) and stress concentration regions (SCR) designs (Bashir et al. 2000; Wahid et al. 2013; Ansari et al. 2013; Ansari and Cho 2014). The cantilever material change can be changed to a softer one like SU-8 (Seena et al. 2011; Nordstrom et al. 2008) and SiO2 (Yang and Yin 2007; Zhou et al. 2009). In addition, sensitivity can also be improved by using the suitable type of dopant (Ansari and Cho 2014). In previous works, the authors has shown that the sensitivity of piezoresistive microcantilevers used in surface stress studies depends weakly on its length (Ansari and Gangadhara 2014) and inversely to its thickness (Ansari and Cho 2014). Hence, the present work focuses on determining the effect of increase in cantilever width on its surface stress sensitivity and on the combined effect of increase in width and the introduction of rectangular holes to induce high stress concentration regions in the designs.",

The cantilever designs have different cantilevers widths and number of rectangular holes circumscribing the piezoresistor. The modifications are in form of the change in length of the rectangular holes. The piezoresistor width and thickness is kept constant. The piezoresistor type is changed as p-type and n-type.

The absence of upper atomic layers results in a redistribution of electronic charges on the surface due to the change in the equilibrium positions of the atoms near the surface and a surface stress in the top layer is generated. Surface stress is an in-plane phenomena and is normally confined to few top atomic layers only. Surface stress is intrinsic to every surface and is generally of the order of 1 N/m on free metal surfaces.

The solid finite element models were meshed using 3-D coupled field 8-node scalar SOLID5 elements. Mesh convergence test was performed for a numbers of cases to confirm the validity of simulation results. On an average, more than 100,000 elements were used in each cantilever analysis. The cantilevers were subjected to three different loads simultaneously, i.e. a surface stress of 1 N/m which was applied to the top surface of the cantilevers, an ambient operating temperature of 25 \u00b0C with convective heat coefficient of air 200 W/m2 \u00b0C and a bias voltage of magnitude 1 V. Surface stress was modelled as in-plane tensile force acting outward normal to the top three free edges of the cantilevers. The average longitudinal and transverse coefficients of piezoresistivity (\u00d710\u221211 m2/N) are, respectively, \u221231 and \u221218 for n-type, and +72 and \u221266 for p-type (Tufte and Stelzer 1963).

The deflections increase with increase in length of the rectangular holes as well as the cantilever width. The increase can be attributed to the decrease in their bending stiffness due to the presence of holes at the fixed end. The increase in hole length is, however, much more effective in increasing the deflection. The frequency results, however, show a pattern opposite to the deflection case. The frequencies decrease with increase in hole length as well as cantilever width. Interestingly, the frequency results for the base models, i.e. A0, B0 and C0, are almost same. This suggests the increase in cantilever width has negligible effect on the frequency. This observation can also be observed in the other cantilever models to a lesser extent. This behaviour can be explained by the fact the increase in cantilever width is increasing linearly both the bending stiffness as well as the cantilever mass. However, since the frequency is directly proportional to the in square root ratio of cantilever stiffness and its mass, the width term in the two quantities cancels out. Therefore, the increase in cantilever width has negligible effect on its frequency. The high frequency of the base models can be attributed to their high bending stiffness because of no holes at the fixed end.\n",

However, since the maximum stresses inside the cantilevers are well below their fracture strength of about 300 MPa (Sooriakumar et al. 1995), the designs presented in this study are safe from fracture failure. In addition, since the typical values of surface stress encountered in analyte-receptor bonding reactions are less than 0.05 N/m, which is one-twentieth the value used here, the deflection and stress induced in the cantilevers would diminish accordingly.",

Since the sensitivity of a piezoresistive microcantilever biosensor depends on the resistance change induced in the piezoresistor whose magnitude depends on the longitudinal and transverse stresses, the stress difference values are also plotted in Fig. 4 to show the effects of the presence of rectangular hole and the hole length as well as the cantilever width.

The negative sign for n-type indicates that the total electrical resistance is decreasing which is because of its negative coefficients of piezoresistivity.

The introduction of rectangular holes increased the sensitivity of A1, B1 and C1 designs to about 1.5, 1.9 and 2.3 times for n-type and 2.9, 2.7 and 3.7 times for p-type cantilevers than their base models A0, B0 and C0.

Based on the results shown in Fig. 5, we can conclude that the sensitivity of piezoresistive microcantilevers can be significantly increased by incorporating the geometric modifications in form of high width and rectangular holes. Though Model#3 cantilevers are showing the highest sensitivity, the fabrication of such designs may be a challenging task. In general, fabrication of narrow cantilevers is easier than a wide one from the release point of view. In addition, cantilevers with long rectangular holes can have a higher probability of non-zero initial deflections and stresses. Therefore, considering the microfabrication constraints we can conclude that p-type B2 microcantilever is the most suitable design for improving the sensitivity of the piezoresistive microcantilever for surface stress studies. This design is relatively easy to fabricate and is less susceptible to fabrication-induced residual stresses.",

The objective was to find the optimum design of the cantilever for such a study by varying the cantilever width, introducing rectangular hole and increasing the hole length, and by changing the type of piezoresistor. The designs were characterised for their tip deflection, resonant frequency, maximum stress and surface stress sensitivity. The surface stress sensitivity of each design was determined by determining the average longitudinal and transverse stress in their piezoresistor element. Results showed that the increase in the cantilever width has mixed results on sensitivity. The sensitivity decreased with increase in cantilever width for n-type designs, and first increased then decreased for p-type designs. The introduction of rectangular holes in the base deigns A0, B0 and C0 increased their sensitivity by about 50 % in n-type and 190 % for p-type designs. However, when the increase in width is combined with the increase in rectangular hole length, the sensitivity of the base deigns A0, B0 and C0 is improved by about 70, 90 and 130 % in n-type, and 190, 170 and 270 % in p-type, respectively. In addition, the increase in hole length was found to have less significant effect on increasing sensitivity and the maximum improvement is less than 23 % for n-type and 28 % for p-type cantilevers. We found that the maximum increase in sensitivity achieved by means of introducing the geometric modifications is about 80 % in n-type and 340 % for p-type designs. Considering the design requirements of high resonant frequency, high sensitivity and fabrication challenges, we can conclude that p-type B2 microcantilever is the most suitable deigns for surface stress studies.",
