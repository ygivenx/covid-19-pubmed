            "text": "Acute otitis media (AOM) mostly occurs during or after viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and is highly prevalent among young children (1,2). The pathogenesis of AOM is complex and involves interactions among the host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Usually, there is a preexisting nasopharyngeal colonization with pathogenic bacteria. Viral URI causes inflammation of the nasopharynx and eustachian tubes, which is mediated by substances such as cytokines and inflammatory mediators. The inflammation leads to eustachian tube dysfunction, which, in turn, causes a negative pressure in the middle ear, allowing the pathogens from the nasopharynx to enter the middle ear. This results in fluid or pus accumulation, thereby causing AOM (1,2). However, although nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during symptomatic viral URI occurs in all children, AOM complication occurs only in about one-third of young children. It is likely that more severe nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury leads to a higher risk for AOM; however, this postulate has not been studied in the clinical setting.",

(5) have also shown that LDH concentrations in NPS are higher during viral URI than during bacterial, allergic, or atrophic rhinitis. The nasopharyngeal cellular injury can arise from a multitude of factors during viral URI; these include direct virus-induced cytopathic injury of the infected cells and participation of leukocytes such as neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in both antibody-dependent and antibody-independent cytotoxicity (10). A variety of chemokines and cytokines, specifically the acute-phase cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and other soluble mediators can act on the local endothelial and epithelial tissues to enhance the migration of the leukocytes toward infected epithelial cells, which, in turn, participate in the cytotoxic injury of infected cells as well as nearby bystander cells.",

(7), who showed a reduced severity of bronchiolitis, a lower airway complication due to viral infection, with high LDH concentrations in NPSs. These researchers propose the concept that a robust inflammatory and immune response in the upper airway, as reflected by high LDH in NPSs, protects against a more severe disease in the distant lower airway. On the other hand, we propose that a more robust inflammatory response in the upper airway increases local complications such as eustachian tube dysfunction, thereby leading to AOM.",

Nonetheless, the association between LDH concentrations and AOM in older children is weaker than that in younger children. In the previous study of LDH concentrations in NPSs in children with bronchiolitis complication, no relationship of LDH with age was seen (6).
