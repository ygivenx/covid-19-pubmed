            "text": "During the past year the agricultural press in Australia has been somewhat critical of the plethora of policies and regulations that surrounds agricultural practice and particularly livestock production. Headlines such as \u201cRegulators show no compassion for our farmers\u201d (Anon 2013) were typical of the types of comments being received. The newly appointed Coalition Government in Australia has vowed to cut regulation and \u201cred tape\u201d profoundly in the coming months. This paper explores why we have regulations and examines a number of contrasting examples of the development and application of regulations in different agricultural areas. It then uses these examples to comment on the process and outcomes of our current regulatory environment for agriculture.",

There are many types of regulations including those that protect us from ourselves and the things we use, those that facilitate how we work together and how we trade, those that protect our fauna and our flora and those that protect our natural and built environment. There are many reasons for having such regulations including protecting us, our flora and fauna and our environment, ensuring that the products available to us are safe and that the world we live in is as safe as it can be. We need to ensure that the things we use do what they are meant to and do so in a way that ensures quality and fitness for purpose. We need to make sure that we receive value from our investments and that we are protected from malpractice in industry. In a nutshell, regulations exist to ensure fairness, openness and equality.1\n",

            "text": "Some specific examples of this include:the move away from continuous flow treatment of liquid waste to one based purely on batch treatment. Continuous flow is the process used by the milk industry for pasteurisation of milk and has been demonstrated as efficacious for many years. For material with relatively low contamination such as shower water it is relatively inexpensive and would be considered by many as managing the risks associated with such material. However it is now largely unacceptable to the regulator for waste treatment in PC3 and PC4 facilities. There is currently little science to support this decision.Showering. It is historically assumed that showering out from a PC3 or PC4 facility is a science proved necessity. This is not the case. In fact very little data exists to demonstrate the utility of showering out of such facilities in terms of reducing pathogen escape. There may be value in other terms but for reducing the risk of a pathogen escape, the data does not exist. Yet it is a firm regulation for all such facilities. It should be noted that a similar lack of data supports the use of chemical disinfectants for decontamination of PC4 suits although this would perhaps be a non-debateable requirement.Discontinuation of the use of formaldehyde. It is now widely accepted that the use of formaldehyde must be discontinued as a room disinfectant even though it has proved safe and effective for this use over many years. The Group of High-Containment Facility Directors pleaded three years ago for the continued use of this disinfectant for room decontamination but to no avail and the regulator has all but banned the use of formaldehyde as it classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen and is a known allergen and irritant. There is however no real scientific data on the negative impacts of formaldehyde used for the purpose of room disinfection where adequate health and safety regulations exists to manage the risks to personnel.Use of fly screens in PC3 and PC4 facilities. In high containment facilities, the input air is normally filtered through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to remove any virus (or larger pathogen) from entering such buildings. This process is repeated with the air leaving the building. Current regulations being applied by the Office of Gene Regulator (OGTR) seem to insist that over and above this, a fly screen must be placed inside of the HEPA filter to prevent flies entering such facilities. Placing such a filter on the outside of the HEPA filter might be valuable in protecting such expensive filters but the regulation demands it be on the inside. It seems absurd to consider that a filter designed to prevent a virus entering the facility would allow a fly though.\n",
