The number of identified emerging infectious diseases has steadily climbed since the 1940s1, and in the early twenty-first century, tools such as PCR, high-throughput sequencing2 and MALDI\u2013TOF mass spectrometry (MS), along with new sampling and culture strategies, are changing clinical microbiology. This technological progress, which began in environmental microbiology3,4, has revealed a much larger microbial world than was believed to exist a few years ago. In 1980, only 1,800 validated bacterial species had been published, whereas more than 500 new species are now described annually5. Thus, over the past 4 years, more new bacterial species have been described than were described in the period up to 1980 (Fig. 1). For example, important human pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori, which can cause gastric ulcers and cancer, and Tropheryma whipplei, the causative agent of Whipple's disease, were first isolated in 1985 and 2001, respectively. For viruses, the progress has been comparable; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus6 and the arenavirus Lujo virus, which causes haemorrhagic fever7, were identified in 2003 and 2009, respectively.",

            "text": "Syndrome- and disease-based kits. The conventional diagnosis of infectious diseases usually relies on a stepwise approach in which the physician examines the patient, diagnoses a clinical syndrome and then tests for pathogens that are potentially responsible for that syndrome, until a diagnosis is made. However, the growing number of emerging pathogens makes it difficult for physicians to memorize the actual list of pathogens for each infectious disease and thus prescribe all the appropriate diagnostic microbiology tests. To reduce the delays associated with resampling or retesting, sampling can be carried out using diagnostic kits that are standardized according to the syndrome or disease. Such a strategy enables optimization of the type and number of specimens collected from the patient, simplification of the laboratory test prescription for the physician, and the creation of a scheduled workflow for the nurse and the doctor, and it also allows the clinical laboratory to easily trace samples. To date, such diagnostic kits have been developed for endocarditis, pericarditis, diarrhoea, osteitis, meningitis, encephalitis, uveitis and keratitis9,10,11, and their design has been based on the repertoire of pathogens responsible for the syndrome or disease, and on the optimal methods to achieve the direct or indirect detection and identification of these pathogens. Further syndrome-based kits can be designed for specific groups of febrile patients, such as those presenting to the emergency room for POC testing, travellers, pilgrims to Mecca (Saudi Arabia), the homeless, or patients with cystic fibrosis and respiratory tract infections12. In addition to the broad syndrome- or disease-based kits, pathogen-specific kits can be used, as for pulmonary tuberculosis13.",

Currently, reference microorganisms are preserved in international collections such as the American Type Culture Collection, the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen and the Japan Collection of Microorganisms. However, because of their number, most clinical isolates routinely cultivated in CMLs are neither conserved nor referred to these collections. The conservation of clinical isolates by CMLs might enable tracing of outbreaks and the characterization of emerging pathogens, and could thus be valuable for both public health (disease surveillance and prevention) and scientific purposes. Notably, bacterial strains cultivated from normally sterile organs and body fluids, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, might be conserved. However, because of the cost, few reference laboratories are currently equipped for long-term storage of samples in such collections.",

Phenotypic identification of bacterial isolates has long relied on a combination of biochemical properties such as oxygen requirement, Gram staining, carbohydrate metabolism and the presence of specific enzymes. However, phenotypic identification systems, such as miniaturized strips, are costly and time-consuming, even when automated, and thus over the past decade have been superseded by MALDI\u2013TOF MS. Worldwide, many large CMLs have adopted MALDI\u2013TOF MS owing to the increased workflow efficiency and associated cost reduction when using this approach31 (Fig. 2). MALDI\u2013TOF MS can identify bacterial isolates in a few minutes (6\u201310 minutes) and for low costs (\u20ac1.43 per strain, compared with \u20ac2.2\u2013\u20ac8.23 per strain using API strips or Vitek automates, both of which are commonly used phenotypic assays, and \u20ac137 per strain for 16S rRNA sequencing)31.

In addition to the rapidity and low cost of MALDI\u2013TOF MS, other advantages include the precise identification of the isolate at the species level and, in some species, at the subspecies and strain levels. Currently, bacterial species from many genera have been identified by MALDI\u2013TOF MS, including fastidious microorganisms (reviewed in Ref. 34). However, the discriminatory power of the method varies depending on the species and the exhaustiveness of the database used. Notably, some bacterial taxa are under-represented in databases, and technical problems (such as variations in culture conditions, sample preparation and the spectrometer used) further affect the discriminatory power of this technique35. In addition, streptococci, non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria are generally harder to discriminate than other bacteria, although this weakness can be partially corrected by enriching the available databases with spectra from more strains31. MALDI\u2013TOF MS can be used for typing community-acquired pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila and Yersinia enterocolitica; health care-associated pathogens, such as Corynebacterium striatum36 and Candida parapsilosis37; and both community- and health care-associated pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, MALDI\u2013TOF MS is now routinely used in several large CMLs for the direct identification of bacteria in blood cultures33. Although MALDI\u2013TOF MS can identify various viral species38, commercially available MS databases do not contain viral spectra; therefore, MALDI\u2013TOF MS does not yet enable the identification of viruses in routine microbiology.",

In this method, light scattering from a laser-illuminated bacterial colony is analysed and transformed into a spectrum that is compared to a specific database. Although this method is inexpensive, reagent-free and as rapid as MS, Raman spectroscopy is not currently widely used in CMLs owing to technical hurdles such as low signal strength, and perhaps also owing to the initial cost of a new instrument. In addition, as for MALDI\u2013TOF MS, the reliability of Raman spectroscopy depends on the quality and coverage of the reference databases.",

            "text": "Detection of antibiotic resistance. Classical methods, such as phenotypic antibiotic-susceptibility testing of a clinical isolate based on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and clinical breakpoints, remain the gold standard for in vitro prediction of antibiotic resistance, but many factors can influence the results obtained for a given isolate and can lead to a false positive or false negative result. MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic able to inhibit the growth of a bacterial isolate in vitro, whereas breakpoints are used to predict the clinical outcome of an antibiotic treatment in vivo. Some new and/or emerging resistance mechanisms might be missed because they are not easily detected phenotypically in vitro. Instead, they require additional molecular testing. Moreover, results from the classical resistance tests might not be rapidly available, especially for fastidious bacteria such as M. tuberculosis42. The application of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to the rapid screening and detection of common antibiotic resistance genes such as mecA or ndm1 (which provide resistance to methicillin in S. aureus43 and carbapenem in bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae44, respectively) was revolutionary. In a similar manner, non-fluorescent DNA microarrays45 and pyrosequencing46 can detect gene mutations or SNPs that are known to be associated with M. tuberculosis resistance to antituberculous compounds. DNA microarrays are another new technology that can detect, in a single step, many resistance genes in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria47. However, microarrays are expensive (\u223c300\u20ac per Mb for microarrays versus 15\u20ac per Mb for high-throughput genome sequencing) and can detect known genes only. Recently, MALDI\u2013TOF MS has also been used clinically for the rapid phenotypic detection of antibiotic resistance, especially of \u03b2-lactamase activity48. For example, it is possible to detect carbapenemase activity in bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in Acinetobacter baumannii through the identification of carbapenem compounds and their degradation products by MALDI\u2013TOF MS in only 1\u20134 hours and with high sensitivity and specificity49,50,51 (Fig. 2). One of the main advantages of this technique is that any enzymatic activity associated with antibiotic resistance can be detected, even if the causative enzyme is unknown, and this could lead to the discovery of new antibiotic resistance determinants.",

Although genotyping all the pathogenic isolates from all cultures would probably have a significant impact on infection control policies and their execution, most genotyping techniques are not carried out routinely, except for the detection of specific clones of certain pathogens. For example, M. tuberculosis str. Beijing can be detected within 2 hours using specific RT-PCR75, enabling patient isolation, contact tracing and extended antituberculous treatment.",

Among molecular diagnostic methods, RT-PCR has proved highly valuable, as it enables diagnoses to be obtained in less than 5 hours, whereas traditional microbiological methods, including conventional molecular diagnostics such as broad PCR followed by sequencing, take a minimum of 1 day. RT-PCR also enables the quantification of pathogens82 and is routinely used to quantify the viral load in patients infected with HIV. RT-PCR assays can target either specific pathogens and resistance- or virulence-encoding genes, or universal targets, such as 16S rDNA for bacteria and rDNA internal transcribed spacers for fungi. In addition, RT-PCR multiplex assays can simultaneously target several DNA fragments, thus enabling the detection of a whole panel of pathogens that are implicated in particular syndromes, such as bloodstream infections83, community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis84, sexually transmitted diseases85 or urinary tract infections86.",

By contrast, POC laboratories (POCLs) are on-site laboratories that carry out rapid diagnostic tests within 4 hours (compared with >12 hours for culture methods or serology assays) and operate around the clock, and these laboratories are perfectly adapted to provide results in the early stages of patient care and can help with making appropriate hospitalization, isolation and therapy decisions (Fig. 3).

POCLs should provide an accurate and rapid answer to a limited number of clinical microbiology questions and have a clear impact on patient management14. POC assays address the requirements to hospitalize patients, to isolate contagious individuals, and to initiate and focus anti-infective therapy. Assays routinely used in POCLs include those developed to detect bacteria (for example, Bordetella pertussis, C. difficile, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes), viruses (including adenoviruses, dengue virus, enteroviruses and influenza viruses) and parasites (such as P. falciparum). Early studies have demonstrated that on-site POCLs met physicians' needs and have influenced the management of up to 8% of the patients who presented to emergency wards14. This strategy might represent a major evolution of decision-making regarding the management of infectious diseases and patient care. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the POCL strategy enables the rapid adaptation of antibiotic therapy for patients with bacterial meningitis and reduces the length of the hospital stay for patients with viral meningitis14. Typically, POCLs feature operator-independent tests, including RT-PCR and immunochromatographic assays, most of which are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission. Compared with standard microbiological procedures, most POC tests have a high positive predictive value, but some of them lack sensitivity93,94.",

The automated early detection of positive blood cultures and the identification of the pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities can significantly reduce mortality in patients with bacteraemia and are among the most important functions of CMLs98.

However, most specimens (except urine specimens) require time-consuming pretreatment, such as fluid sputum sample preparation or solid specimen grinding, or the use of specific and expensive swabs. Concomitantly, there is an increasing need to freeze and store samples in biobanks after inoculation or DNA extraction. Therefore, the future generation of automated plate streakers should incorporate functionalities such as aliquoting or DNA extraction or should connect to automated DNA extraction and/or amplification systems, such as the GeneXpert system (Cepheid). Finally, with the aim of complete automation, these systems should be coupled with automated urinary flow cytometry100 and automated incubation in adapted atmospheres.

For example, until recently, the usefulness of blood cultures in the emergency room was limited, as the results of identification and antibiotic-susceptibility testing were only available 72 hours after sampling105. Under these conditions, either the empirically prescribed antibiotic treatment was effective, or it had to be changed to another treatment, the worst-case scenario being the patient's death before the diagnosis was established. Clearly, CMLs can only have a major impact on early patient management when diagnostic speed enables the appropriate medical decisions to be made rapidly. In terms of treatment, rapid pathogen identification combined with knowledge about where the patient contracted the infection (for example, whether it was hospital acquired or community acquired) enables the presumptive deduction of antimicrobial susceptibility, and such antibiotic stewardship based on rapid diagnostics can reduce hospitalization costs106. Another crucial challenge for clinical microbiology, at a time when the need for cost reduction favours laboratory concentration, is to avoid a disconnection between core CMLs and clinical settings.

As an example, an increase in the number of cerebrospinal fluid samples referred to the laboratory in the absence of an aetiologically labelled outbreak of meningitis should alert laboratory technicians and prompt the search for a new pathogen.
