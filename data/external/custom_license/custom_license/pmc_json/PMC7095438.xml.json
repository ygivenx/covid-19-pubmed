It could be caused by H5N1, the avian flu strain of such concern in Asia; it could even rival the devastation of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Whatever form it takes, it is sobering to realize that when the last pandemic emerged in 1968, in China, the nation's human population was 790 million and the poultry population 12.3 million; today those numbers are 1.3 billion and 13 billion, respectively. Similar changes have occurred in other Asian countries, creating an incredible mixing vessel for viruses. A pandemic could be unleashed tomorrow or in ten years from now, but the scene for a potential catastrophe is already set.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued a revised global influenza preparedness plan that provides recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic2. It is meant to help countries develop or update their national flu preparedness plans. The WHO's plan primarily targets public-health officials, although an executive summary has been produced for senior policy-makers who may have a public-health background. Although the WHO's document is a helpful tool for those responsible for preparedness at the national level, it falls far short of what is needed at either the ground level (local day-to-day planning) or at the international level (long-term planning). But it is critical to consider all three perspectives when planning preparedness and response strategies. Unfortunately, all other national and state plans suffer from similar failings.",
