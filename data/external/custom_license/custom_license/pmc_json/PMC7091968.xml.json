In addition to a more efficient and cost-effective protocol for PTPN11 analysis in Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes, GeneDx has expanded its extensive menu with tests for two related disorders, Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome and Costello syndrome. GeneDx now provides complete sequence analysis of the three major genes involved in these disorders with overlapping clinical features. BRAF gene testing in CFC syndrome will identify disease-causing mutations in 40%\u201378% of patients, while HRAS gene testing in Costello syndrome is expected to reveal mutations in 82%\u201392% of patients. The availability of molecular diagnostic testing for CFC, Costello and Noonan syndromes will aid physicians in differentiating among these syndromes and related conditions such as Kabuki syndrome, help in developing a targeted evaluation and management plan, and provide information for more accurate family counseling.",

            "text": "CFC, Costello and Noonan syndromes are complex developmental disorders including cardiovascular defects, developmental delay, mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and a wide spectrum of other associated anomalies. Patients with Costello syndrome have a tumor predisposition and 10%\u201315% develop malignant tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and transitional carcinoma of the bladder. Postnatal growth deficiency, short stature and congenital heart defects, the most frequent of which are pulmonic stenosis, atrial septal defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, are common manifestations of CFC syndrome. In Noonan syndrome, the cognitive deficits and ectodermal problems are usually milder than in the other two disorders.",

            "text": "In early 2006, several research studies revealed that the clinical similarities between CFC, Costello and Noonan syndromes derive from a common molecular basis as mutations in each causative gene result in activation or alteration of the ancient Ras/MAP kinase pathway that controls cell proliferation and differentiation. The vast majority of mutations in BRAF (CFC syndrome), HRAS (Costello syndrome) and PTPN11 (Noonan syndrome) are de novo missense mutations, which can be detected with DNA sequence analysis as performed at GeneDx. Based on a reported clustering of mutations, GeneDx offers cost-effective two-tier testing in these genes. Tier 1 testing includes sequence analysis of hot spot regions. If no mutation is found, Tier 2 sequence analysis of the remaining coding exons of these genes is available.",
