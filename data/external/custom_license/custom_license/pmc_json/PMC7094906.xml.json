The animals, which are sold for food, will be dispatched because they carry the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which has turned up in a resident of the region \u2014 the first case, apart from those caused by laboratory contamination, since last year's global outbreak (see page 89).",

This is in marked contrast to the tardy and secretive response to the previous outbreak, which first emerged in rural areas of Guangdong province in late 2002. However, the case also exposes shortcomings in China's system for monitoring and responding to infectious disease.",

The natural animal reservoir for the SARS virus remains unknown \u2014 civets may be infected in markets from some other animal, and we don't even know whether they can pass the virus to people.",

The real question, however, is why they are on sale in the first place. At the height of the SARS outbreak, China closed its wildlife markets, only to lift the ban in August. That relaxation was unwise.",

Away from major cities, many clinics \u2014 especially those specializing in traditional medicine, which are the first stop for most of the population \u2014 are not integrated into the disease-surveillance system. If China is to protect its people from re-runs of last year's SARS nightmare, this needs to change.",
