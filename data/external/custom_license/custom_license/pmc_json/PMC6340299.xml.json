Motile organisms typically capture light using rhodopsin proteins, largely classified into two groups: microbial (type I) and animal (type II)1,2, both exhibiting seven-transmembrane helices and a retinal-based chromophore, but with different effector mechanisms. Animal rhodopsins primarily work as G-protein-coupled receptors that recruit secondary messengers to control effectors such as ion channels that modulate cellular activity, whereas channel and pump microbial rhodopsins can directly provide effector functionality as transmembrane current1,2. Heterologous expression of single-component microbial opsin genes targeted to specific cells of animals defines an experimental approach (optogenetics3) for biology, enabling control of specific cells in behaving organisms with light.",

Variants of the channel subtype (cation-conducting channelrhodopsins, CCRs) elicit light-triggered cation currents (usually excitatory in neurons). Indeed, light-triggered cation currents are excitatory in the natural host as well; plant behaviours initially observed by botanists more than 150 years ago (movement of single-celled algae excited by light)4 were later found to be due to CCRs, with the initially known member of this subclass (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ChR1) identified as a cation channel in 20025. Many CCRs have been discovered or designed5\u201314, and currently available CCRs offer a palette of diversity in absorption spectrum, photocurrent magnitude, light sensitivity and on/off-kinetics12,15.",

Light-induced neuronal inhibition with microbial opsins was first achieved with inward Cl\u2212 pumps and outward H+ pumps such as Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin (NpHR) and archaerhodopsin-3 (AR3)17,18. Although widely used, these pumps move only one ion per photon (versus hundreds for channels), thereby exhibiting reduced efficacy15,16. In 2014, anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (ACRs) were created19,20 on the CCR backbone, guided by structural modelling; subsequently, in 2015, naturally occurring ACRs were isolated from chlorophyte algae21 (GtACR1 and GtACR2). The designed ACRs have been developed further22\u201324, and additional natural ACRs have been found by genome mining25\u201327. ACRs can translocate 104\u2013105 ions per second21 and can exhibit 102\u2013104-fold higher light sensitivity than inhibitory pumps19\u201321. After the first demonstration in 2015 of ACRs as inhibitory optogenetic tools that could successfully modulate animal behaviour (with a designed ACR called iC++22), both ACR classes have been widely applied in mice, flies and fish22,23,28\u201330.",

Notably, C1C2, CrChR2 and GtACR1 all have several (2\u20133) N-terminal cysteine residues, but with different positions and functions. Cys66, Cys73 and Cys75 of C1C2, and Cys34 and Cys36 of CrChR2 form three and two intermolecular disulfide bridges respectively (Fig. 2c). Previous studies had predicted that the residue corresponding to Cys73 in C1C2 (Cys34 in CrChR2) would be Cys21 in GtACR126 and would form an intermolecular disulfide bridge32. However, the GtACR1 structure revealed that Cys21 forms not an intermolecular, but instead a new intramolecular, disulfide bridge with Cys219 on ECL3, whereas Cys6 forms an intermolecular disulfide bridge (Figs. 1, 2c). Gel-filtration chromatography and SDS\u2013PAGE (Extended Data Fig. 5d, e) further support the conclusion that Cys21 and Cys219 are more important for folding and expression, and Cys6 for dimerization.",

Notably, because of these differences in the N terminus and ICL2, the interface area of the GtACR1 dimer (1,315 \u00c52) is smaller than that for the C1C2 (2,027 \u00c52) or CrChR2 (1,688 \u00c52) dimers (Extended Data Fig. 5f\u2013h). This property is concordant with our finding that loss of the intermolecular disulfide bridge markedly affects GtACR1 dimerization in SDS\u2013PAGE analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5e), whereas the loss of the disulfide in C1C2\u2013CrChR2 has minimal effect on dimerization36\u201338.",

GtACR1 and C1C2 contain similar configurations of all-trans-retinal and 15-anti-retinal34,39,40 (Fig. 2a). Here we focus on comparison with C1C2, because the 2017 CrChR2 CCR structure was almost identical to the well-studied 2012 C1C2 CCR structure (Extended Data Fig. 4c; r.m.s.d. value of 0.82 \u00c5 over all C\u03b1 atoms), and was also reported as a mixture of two states D480 and D470 (absorbing light at 480 and 470 nm, respectively)35,36,41 making it difficult to compare to GtACR135,36. The GtACR1 structure reveals that most residues forming the retinal-binding pocket (RBP) are not conserved between GtACR1 and CCRs (Fig. 3a, b; Extended Data Fig. 3); in C1C2, ATR is enclosed by 16 residues (Fig. 3b), but 11 are not conserved in GtACR1 (Fig. 3a).

Thr198, which interacts with the \u03b2-ionone ring of ATR in C1C2, corresponds to Cys133 in GtACR1 (Fig. 3a, b). In HsBR and CrChR2, mutations in residues surrounding the \u03b2-ionone affect biophysical properties; for example, M118A in HsBR changes the absorption spectrum (\u03bbmax shifting from 551 to 474 nm)43, and T159C in CrChR2 affects conductance and kinetics44. However, the GtACR1(C133A) and GtACR1(C133R) mutants exhibited only slightly blue-shifted spectra, with kinetics and photocurrents comparable to wild-type levels (Fig. 3c, e; Extended Data Figs. 6\u20138). Thus, the RBP of the GtACR1 \u03b2-ionone may be unusually robust (which could also depend on additional non-conserved residues around Cys133, such as Thr134 and Phe160; Fig. 3a, b; Extended Data Fig. 3). Another interesting RBP residue is Cys237, which affects key properties including absorption, kinetics and selectivity when mutated to alanine (Fig. 3c\u2013e; Extended Data Figs. 6\u20138); notably, the mutant exhibits only a single fast component of current decay (\u03c4off1:87 \u00b1 4.1 ms), suggesting involvement of this residue in the slow-closing mechanism (likely along with the Cys102 residue31; Fig. 3c\u2013e).",

However, in GtACR1, the TM3 residue is Ser97, and the TM7 Asp234 has a conformation quite different from Asp292 of C1C2, possibly owing to local interactions with Tyr72 and Tyr207. Notably, the overall architecture of the Schiff-base region in GtACR1 is more similar to halorhodopsins (Fig. 4a). However, in GtACR1, there is no clear electron density, suggesting water or Cl\u2212 within hydrogen-bonding distance of the Schiff-base (Supplementary Discussion), and presumably the protonated Schiff base forms at least a weak hydrogen bond with Asp234 (Fig. 4a). Therefore, we undertook structure-guided functional characterization of Tyr72, Tyr207 and Asp234.",

Because the wild-type \u03bbmax of the UV-vis spectra and intensity of the FTIR peak-pair remain unchanged from pH 5\u20139 (Extended Data Fig. 9c), Asp234 is therefore presumed to be protonated over a wide pH range, concordant with previous Raman spectroscopy39.",

            "text": "However, surprisingly, electrophysiology revealed that D234N nearly abolishes the photocurrent (Fig. 4d). Generally, the effects of aspartate-to-asparagine mutation are small when aspartate is protonated, but in the uniquely configured GtACR1 Schiff-base environment involving close apposition of Asp234, the small difference between aspartate-hydroxyl and asparagine-amino could rearrange the hydrogen-bond network around the Schiff base and thus disturb light-induced conformational changes. This concept is supported by difference FTIR spectra in the amide-I region at 170 K and 200 K (Fig. 4e): the intensity of negative bands at 1,640 and 1,655 cm\u22121 decreases in D234N, revealing that the conformational change of transmembrane helices in D234N is significantly smaller than in the wild type. Just as with D234N, the nearby Y207F mutation also causes loss-of-function (Fig. 4d). Considering that Phe207 naturally occurs in fully functional C1C2 and even in other natural ACRs including GtACR2 and the ZipACR variant with divergent sequences27 (Extended Data Fig. 3), the precisely arranged hydrogen-bond network of the Schiff-base region thus appears essential for channel activity.",

C1C2 has a cation-conducting pore pathway formed by TM1, TM2, TM3 and TM7, and GtACR1 has a pore pathway at approximately the same position (Fig. 5a, b) with three marked differences. First, in a pattern opposite to that of C1C2, the surface around the pore of GtACR1 is electropositive, suitable for cation exclusion and thus anion selectivity46 (Fig. 5a; Extended Data Fig. 10a); by contrast, C1C2 has 7 carboxylates along the ion-conducting pathway (Glu121, Glu122, Glu129, Glu136, Glu140, Glu162 and Asp292) and 14 carboxylates on intracellular/extracellular surfaces (Fig. 5b; Extended Data Fig. 10b, d), all contributing to electronegative surfaces in and around the pore suitable for anion exclusion/cation selectivity (Fig. 5b). In GtACR1, Glu122, Glu136 and Glu162 are replaced by Ala61, Ala75 and Ser97, respectively (Fig. 5a) and Glu140 is also not conserved (Extended Data Fig. 3). Also, as shown by previous and present FTIR, residues corresponding to Glu129/Asp292 (Glu68/Asp234) are neutralized45 (Fig. 4b, c). Finally, 12 protein-surface residues are replaced with arginine or lysine; the consistency of this pattern suggests these residues (and Arg94/Lys238) contribute to a suitable electrostatic environment for cation exclusion/anion conduction in GtACR1, confirming earlier predictions46 (Extended Data Figs. 3, 10a, c).",

However, Glu136 and Glu140 are not conserved in GtACR1, and the extracellular-side TM1 and TM2 are markedly tilted, as described above (Figs. 2c, 5a; Extended Data Fig. 3). Thus, pore size becomes much larger, and EV1 becomes connected to the GtACR1 pore-pathway. Furthermore, in contrast to EV1, EV2 of GtACR1 is disconnected because of interactions among Tyr81, Arg94 and Glu223 (extracellular constriction site 2, ECS2) (Figs. 5a, 6a), indicating that EV1 serves as the primary anion-entry pathway in GtACR1. Third, the anion-conducting pathway of GtACR1 is opened not only towards the extracellular side but also intracellularly. In C1C2, although the cation-conducting pathway is opened towards the extracellular side, the cytoplasmic side is occluded by intracellular (ICS) and central (CCS) constriction sites34. However, in GtACR1, residues forming the ICS in C1C2, including Tyr109, Glu122, His173 and Arg307, are replaced by Met 50, Ala61, Leu108 and Thr249, respectively, and the intracellular vestibule extends to the CCS (Figs. 5, 6b, c).",

These three residues are conserved in GtACR1 (Gln46, Glu68 and Asn239) and its Gln46 on TM1 forms an additional hydrogen bond with Asn239, thereby further stabilizing the CCS. To test the function of these residues, we prepared 10 mutants of Gln46, Glu68 and Asn239, and measured activity by patch-clamp analysis. All Glu68 and Asn239 mutants exhibited smaller photocurrents, and Q46A showed comparable photocurrents but depolarized reversal-potential (Fig. 6d, e). Thus, all three CCS residues are important for anion-channel function, but with different roles: Glu68 and Asn239 for conductance, and Gln46 for selectivity.",

Furthermore, a TM2 tyrosine (Tyr72, uniformly conserved among pump-type halorhodopsins and bacteriorhodopsins) is present in GtACR1 (and is almost 100% conserved among natural ACRs; Extended Data Fig. 3)27 but is dispensable for function; Y72F changes neither conductance (Fig. 4d) nor kinetics of the M-intermediate rise or decay (Extended Data Fig. 6d), characterized by fast or slow kinetics, respectively. This differs from bacteriorhodopsin, in which Y57F accelerates formation of the M-intermediate47. Because CCRs have replaced this residue (Extended Data Fig. 3), an evolutionary model is suggested in which natural ACRs such as GtACR1 evolved from light-driven Cl\u2212 pumps, and CCRs subsequently arose from natural ACRs via surface electrostatic remodelling4,46.",

In the dark, the Schiff-base nitrogen is protonated and therefore requires a mechanism to stabilize the positive charge. In GtACR1, Glu68 and Asp234 provide the only carboxylates within 6 \u00c5 of this Schiff-base nitrogen (approximately 5.4 \u00c5 and 3.5 \u00c5, respectively), but FTIR analyses indicate that both are also protonated in the dark45 (Fig. 4d, e). Cl\u2212 does not have a charge-stabilization role either, as Cl\u2212 is not bound to the Schiff-base region in GtACR133 (Fig. 4a; unlike in HsHR48). One possible explanation is that strongly polarized water could bind to the Schiff base (behaving as a hydroxyl ion, as proposed in HsBR and mutants2,49,50; Supplementary Discussion), and another possibility is that the partial-negative charge of the nearby Asp234 carbonyl is sufficient to weakly stabilize the positively charged Schiff base. As a result, the net charge in the Schiff-base region may represent the achievement of perhaps the most challenging evolutionary step in the adaptation to facilitate anion conduction (alongside the acquisition of positive surface electrostatic potential throughout the pore and vestibules; Fig. 4): namely, partial local positivity despite the obligate negative nature of the Schiff base counterion.",

Small wedge data, each consisting of 5\u201320\u00b0, were collected from single crystals, and 131 collected datasets were processed automatically using KAMO52. Each dataset was indexed and integrated using XDS53, and classified using the correlation coefficients between data sets. Eighty datasets in the best cluster were scaled and merged using XSCALE. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with the program MoRDa (Vagin and Lebedev; http://www.biomexsolutions.co.uk/morda), using the cation channelrhodopsin C1C2 (PDB accession 3UG9) and G11A mutant of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (PDB accession 2PWX) as the search models. However, the 2PWX model was not fitted to electron density at all and removed. The resultant structure was iteratively refined using Refmac554, Phenix55 and MR-rosetta56, and manually rebuilt in Coot57. The final model contained 95.7, 4.1 and 0.3% in the favoured, allowed and outlier regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively. Final refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 1. All molecular graphics figures were prepared with Cuemol (Ishitani; http://www.cuemol.org).",
