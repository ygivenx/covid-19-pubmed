Rylander and coworkers [1] assessed the volume of poorly or nonventilated gas in mechanically ventilated ARDS patients. They assumed that the difference ratio between ventilated gas volume (end-expiratory lung volume, measured using sulphur hexafluoride) and total gas volume (total end-expiratory gas volume independent of ventilation, measured using computed tomography) represents poorly or nonventilated gas volume. About one-third of the total gas volume was poorly or nonventilated in the lungs of ARDS patients at a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level of 5 cmH2O. This uneven distribution of ventilation is probably due to the presence of small airway closure and/or obstruction, and a recruitment procedure might ameliorate this.",

In an easily recruitable model of acute lung injury (ALI), recruitment (45 cmH2O for 40 s) did not result in oxygenation changes consistent with recruitment. However, changes in aerated and nonaerated lung after the recruitment manoeuvre were adequately represented by changes in plateau pressure, respiratory system compliance and recruitable volume. It seems that the degree of improvement in oxygenation is not so much determined by reduction in nonaerated lung as by the blood flow through these regions.",

Hermon and coworkers [3] investigated whether surfactant application could influence these variables in children with respiratory failure. After application of surfactant, mean tidal volume almost doubled (186% of baseline value), mean compliance increased significantly (176% of baseline value) and radiographic scores tended to decrease within 48 hours.

It also led to a redistribution of tidal ventilation to dependent lung zones in oleic acid induced lung injury. Spontaneous breathing with airway pressure release ventilation countered the undesirable cyclic alveolar collapse in dependent lung regions, which can contribute to ventilator-associated lung injury, but no indices of lung injury were assessed. These data are in support of the hypothesis that active contractions of the diaphragm are a major explanatory factor in the improved oxygenation observed in animal models and in patients with ALI with reduction in intrapulmonary shunt. These data suggest that allowing spontaneous breathing activity in ALI could help to reduce lung injury.",

Treatment with steroids (odds ratio 4.5), COPD (odds ratio 2.9) and neutropenia (odds ratio 9.4) were significantly associated with Aspergillus spp. isolation. Aspergillus spp. was recovered in 36 patients; in 14 patients isolation of Aspergillus spp. was interpreted as colonization (mortality 50%), in 20 patients it was interpreted as invasive aspergillosis (mortality 80%), and two cases were not classified. Antifungal treatment should be considered in patients with clinical features of pneumonia, with isolation of Aspergillus spp. from respiratory secretions, and who have either COPD or are undergoing treatment with corticosteroids. In contrast, antifungal treatment should not be initiated when Aspergillus spp. are recovered from bronchial aspirates of critically ill patients without predisposing risk factors and in the absence of clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia. In these cases, isolation of Aspergillus spp. should be interpreted as colonization.",

Using a mathematical analysis based on fitting these curves, they demonstrated that PCP in IPAH patients is greater than normal, and that the different algorithms yielded different PCP within the groups. The time needed to reach steady-state pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure was longer in the IPAH group (higher time constants). However, methodological limitations to this occlusion technique confound interpretation.

Although this was a limited study, a respiratory variation in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude above 15% accurately discriminated between patients with a respiratory variation in systemic pulse pressure above 13% from those with a variation of 13% or less.
