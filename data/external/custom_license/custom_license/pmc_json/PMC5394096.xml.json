ORF2 encodes the structural protein capsid (Cap) that forms the viral coat (Nawagitgul et al., 2000). Cap contains a nuclear localization signal of 41 amino acids at the N-terminus that determines its subcellular location during the viral life cycle (Liu et al., 2001). PCV2 Rep proteins are localized in the nuclei of infected PK-15 cells (Timmusk et al., 2006), whereas Cap can be detected in the nuclei and cytoplasm (Gilpin et al., 2003), indicating that the Cap protein shuttles between distinct cellular compartments during the infection cycle. The ORF3 protein remains controversial and appears to contribute to apoptosis both in vitro (Liu et al., 2005) and in vivo (Liu et al., 2006). Other putative ORFs are reportedly present in the PCV2 genome, such as ORF4 (He et al., 2013) and ORF5 (Lv et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Mounting evidence indicates that a wide variety of viruses could disturb endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and lead to ER stress (Li et al., 2015). To cope with the stress, cells activate a series of adaptive mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Hetz, 2012). When cells are overwhelmed due to prolonged stress, UPR leads to intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis (Tabas and Ron, 2011). There is a complex relationship between host cells and virus infection with regard to UPR and apoptosis. In addition to our early reports showing that PCV2 infection could induce autophagy (Zhu et al., 2012a; 2012b; Gu et al., 2016), we have recently revealed that PCV2 could induce UPR by selective activation of the RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway (Zhou et al., 2016). This study aimed to investigate which protein(s) of PCV2 could be responsible for activation of UPR and if apoptosis would be the eventual destiny of the cells undergoing UPR.",

In order to identify the specific PCV2 protein(s) involved in UPR induction, we investigated the involvement of viral proteins in activating UPR. By using a transient transfection system with PK-15 cells, we found that expression of Rep or Cap caused significant elevation of the phosphorylated form of PERK and eIF2\u03b1 over a time course of 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, while the levels of total PERK and eIF2\u03b1 remained unchanged. GRP78, a well-established marker of ER stress, was induced progressively and remained elevated at 48 h post-transfection (hpt) in cells expressing Cap protein, as compared to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1a). While ORF3 protein failed to induce UPR since the expression of GRP78, p-PERK and p-eIF2\u03b1 were relatively stable (Fig. 1b). These results suggest that Rep and Cap are primarily responsible for UPR induction during PCV2 infection.",

Given that Cap expression resulted in significant downregulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3 cleavage, we focused our attention on this structural protein. We silenced PERK in Cap-expressing cells to elucidate its role in Cap-mediated apoptosis. Fig. 5a shows that Bcl-2 level was partially restored in siPERK-transfected cells. In contrast to significant caspase-3 cleavage detected in Cap-expressing cells, transfection with siPERK showed a reduced level of caspase-3 cleavage. To further confirm this observation, flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis was conducted. Fig. 5b shows that the percentage of annexinV+/PI\u2212 apoptotic cells was lower in PERK-knockdown Cap-expressing cells than in controls. Lower level of apoptotic response accorded with reduced expression of CHOP and increased expression of Bcl-2 as a result of PERK silencing. Taken together, these results indicate that PERK is involved in Cap-induced apoptosis via upregulation of CHOP and downregulation of Bcl-2.",

For virus-triggered ER stress, the three UPR transmembrane sensors are differentially activated (Li et al., 2015). UPR could be beneficial or detrimental to viral replication, depending on the pathways and cellular contexts involved (Ambrose and Mackenzie, 2011; 2013). To survive and propagate in host cells, viruses have evolved specific mechanisms to modulate or even subvert UPR (Li et al., 2015). In our recent report, we showed that PCV2 could deploy UPR to enhance its replication via PERK/eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway (Zhou et al., 2016). However, the mechanisms utilized by PCV2 to benefit its replication under stress conditions as well as the viral protein(s) involved in induction of UPR have yet to be elucidated. In this current report, we provide further evidence that Cap is the major contributor of PCV2 to UPR and subsequent apoptotic response, most likely via the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway.",

Upregulation of GRP78 in PK-15 cells with transient expression of Rep or Cap is consistent with that observed in PCV2 infection (Zhou et al., 2016). Next, we examined the PERK pathway as it is selectively activated during PCV2 infection. Both Rep and Cap activated PERK and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation as well as their downstream molecules ATF4 and CHOP. By silencing PERK, we confirmed that PERK is essential for induction of CHOP. PERK knockdown resulted in marked reduction of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and increased expressions of ATF4 and CHOP, indicating the linkage of PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP axis as seen in PCV2 infection-induced UPR (Zhou et al., 2016). Increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 upon ER stress inhibits general protein translation, with the exception of ATF4 that is actually activated to promote many adaptive responses to restore ER function and maintain cell survival (Hetz, 2012). However, sustained stress also activates the transcription of CHOP, one of the key UPR pro-apoptotic players, probably by downregulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Oyadomari and Mori, 2004). Therefore, we suspected that there might be a connection between UPR and apoptosis in Cap-expressing cells.",

            "text": "We did observe significant decrease of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression concomitant with increased cleavage of caspase-3 in Cap-expressing cells, but not in cells expressing Rep. Reduced Bcl-2 could be due to increased expression of CHOP (Oyadomari and Mori, 2004). Various viruses regulate apoptosis through CHOP. For example, hepatitis C virus elicits UPR and triggers apoptosis through induction of CHOP and ER calcium depletion (Benali-Furet et al., 2005); hepatitis C virus envelope proteins E1 and E2 could activate the CHOP promoter (Chan and Egan, 2005); and infectious bronchitis virus activates the eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP pathway and upregulation of CHOP plays a critical role in apoptosis (Liao et al., 2013). By RNA silencing, we found that Cap-induced caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis were reduced in cells transfected with siPERK and the Bcl-2 level was partially restored, indicating that Cap induces apoptotic cell death by sending the message through the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway down to the mitochondria that ultimately converge on executioner caspase-3 (Tabas and Ron, 2011). Thus, we propose that PCV2 infection induces UPR with subsequent apoptotic response via its Cap protein. This might explain the mechanism why transient Cap protein expressions of PCV2a and PCV2b induce cell death (Walia et al., 2014). This is also different from earlier reports showing that ORF3 seemed to induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activation (Liu et al., 2005; 2006), suggesting that PCV2 is able to deploy two distinct mechanisms in inducing apoptotic response.",
