The posttransplant period was complicated by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome stage 1, with episodes of acute respiratory distress. The immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus (through level 10\u201315 ng/mL), low-dose steroids (0.10 mg/kg/day), and monthly courses of extracorporeal photopheresis that were initiated after a 3-month course of low-dose azythromycin (discontinued because of lack of efficacy).",

She had cough and fever (38\u00b0C), abdominal cramps, and diarrhea (6\u201310 bowel movements/day, liquid but not bloody). Routine fecal examination and cultures were negative for common gastrointestinal bacteria (Mycobacteria, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter spp.), parasites (protozoa and helminths), and viruses (astrovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus). Because of the patient\u2019s persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and a positive fecal calprotectin result, a colonoscopy was performed; it revealed inflamed cecal mucosa without ulcerative lesions. Histologic examination of colonic biopsy samples showed mild, chronic, interstitial inflammation, including eosinophils and lymphoid microaggregates. Therefore, fecal samples were examined for less common gastroenteric viral agents\u2014rhinovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, coronavirus, sapovirus, aichivirus and HCoSV\u2014by using conventional and real-time PCR or nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (1,7\u201314). Samples were negative for all gastrointestinal viruses searched for except for HCoSV. This virus was detected by a nested RT-PCR targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (1) and quantified on the basis of serial log10 dilution of extracted nucleic acid estimating the presence of 107 RNA copies/mL in fecal samples. The 316-bp 5\u2032 UTR amplicon was sequenced by using an ABI Prism 3100 DNA automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), assembled by Sequencer software, version 5.0 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and compared with available HCoSV sequences with the BLAST program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Nucleotide identity with the HCoSV species D (species D1) (GenBank accession no. FJ438908) was 93%.",

Phylogenetic analysis, performed with the maximum-likelihood method with parameters selected by the Model Selection tool in MEGA version 5.0 (15), showed that the HCoSV VP3\u2013VP1 sequence from Italy clustered with species E strains found in Australia and Bolivia and recombinant D/E strains circulating in Nigeria. Although homology was greatest (97% nt and 81% aa identity) with a strain from Australia (GenBank accession no.
