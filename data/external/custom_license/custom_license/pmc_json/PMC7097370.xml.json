Nanoparticles provide adjuvant activity by enhancing the delivery of antigens to the immune system or by potentiating innate immune responses (Fig. 2). We discuss some of these nanotechnologies in the section below (Fig. 3; Table 2). Some nanotechnologies that improve vaccine efficiency, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) and MF59 (Novartis), have been used for decades, whereas others are still at the early stages of development.",

More than 20 to 30 different enveloped or non-enveloped VLPs are currently in preclinical and clinical development4. VLPs can be produced either without modification or by genetically engineering the viral capsid subunit by bioconjugation of the viral capsid subunit with antigenic peptides or other ligands or by site-directed mutagenesis of the intact VLP to create a functional scaffold for multivalent surface presentation of antigens. Other structures can be incorporated into VLPs, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, cell-targeting moieties or other biologically active mediators, to augment vaccine efficacy. In human clinical trials, VLPs loaded with synthetic A-type CpG-oligonucleotides (CpG-ODNs) and peptide epitopes derived from melanoma-associated antigens, such as melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART1), have been shown to activate multifunctional central memory T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that produce interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)5.",

These nanoparticles have been used to enable the preferential uptake of vaccine antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Notably, smaller nanoparticles (25\u201340 nm in size)6 penetrate tissue barriers and traffic to the draining lymph nodes more rapidly than larger nanoparticles (greater than 100 nm in size), which are typically retained by cells at the site of injection and which need to be taken up and trafficked by dendritic cells (DCs) to facilitate their transport to the lymph nodes6,7 (Fig. 2). As such, smaller nanoparticles might lead to more effective activation of adaptive immune responses7,8,9.",

Furthermore, whereas most extracellular proteins that are taken up by DCs are processed and presented via the MHC class II pathway, the uptake of nanoparticles such as VLPs promotes DC activation and the presentation of antigens on both MHC class I and MHC class II molecules. Importantly, this leads to the priming of both antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells4,11,12,13,14 (Figs 2,3).",

The use of a recombinant protein engineered to self-assemble into a VLP in the recombinant HBV vaccine was a major advance in safety, and the plasma-based HBV vaccine has now been replaced15. However, this first generation of VLP-based vaccines requires adjuvants for optimal immunogenicity in healthy individuals and is not highly effective in high-risk populations such as immunosuppressed patients and elderly individuals. In addition, the HBV vaccines are highly effective as a prophylactic vaccine but ineffective as a therapeutic vaccine. The formulation of HBV vaccines with aluminium (alum) adjuvants is a major limitation with respect to the effective induction of T cell-mediated immunity against chronic hepatitis B, as alum predominantly activates T helper 2 (TH2)-type immune responses19,20. The HPV vaccine that has more recently been developed uses monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) added to alum as an adjuvant to induce a TH1-type immune response and CTLs that are associated with antiviral immunity19,21,22,23,24,25.",

Recombinant HBV vaccines have been licensed since 1986 and hundreds of millions of doses have been administered worldwide. Pitfalls of advancing any new technology, such as novel adjuvants that enhance the immune response, include the potential risks of inducing rare, but serious, adverse reactions that only become evident after the evaluation of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Concerns about the induction of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, following VLP-based vaccination have been raised but have not been confirmed27. In a systematic review of the association between multiple sclerosis and hepatitis B vaccination, 1 out of 12 studies reported an association. The authors of that review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to modify vaccination schedules and called for additional studies to be carried out27. VLPs and other emerging nanoparticle-based technologies provide new strategies to enhance the induction of potent, long-lasting and potentially broadly reactive (multiclade neutralization) humoral and cellular immune responses that will be crucial to achieve protection and therapy against chronic infections, rapidly mutating pathogens such as influenza and HIV-1, and late-stage malignant diseases as discussed below. These benefits must be balanced against any real or perceived risks so that the use of the vaccine is high and a benefit to public health is achieved.",

The development of fully synthetic VLPs using chemically synthesized lipopeptide monomers28 to enhance nanoparticle assembly and to stabilize the three-dimensional conformational structure of protein antigens provides an intriguing vaccine strategy to stimulate neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. In contrast to enveloped HIV-1 VLPs, which are limited by low Env density per virion4,29,30, or to the self-assembling peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) described below, the synthetic approach does not require recombinant DNA technology or the expression and the purification of the monomer proteins from producer cells. Lipopeptide-based synthetic VLPs (20\u201330 nm in size) have been used to repetitively display a peptide-mimetic epitope derived from the V3-variable loop of gp120 (Ref. 31). This engineered epitope was designed by modelling the stable three-dimensional \u03b2-hairpin conformation that is formed after the binding of a broadly cross-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody to the gp120 antigen. This synthetic VLP also incorporated a universal TH cell epitope32 (this immunogenic peptide promiscuously binds to multiple different MHC class II molecules to improve the induction of TH cells) and a tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine (Pam3Cys) lipid moiety, which induces TLR2 activation. Interestingly, the immunization of New Zealand white rabbits with these synthetic VLPs alone induced the production of neutralizing antibodies against the envelope proteins of multiple HIV-1 strains31. Thus, structural vaccinology and other strategies for immunogen design29,33, in combination with repetitive antigen display using nanoparticle-based technologies as a vaccine platform, might enable the induction of responses against poorly accessible but conserved neutralizing epitopes rather than against more readily accessible immunodominant non-neutralizing epitopes expressed on the native gp120 spike29. Responses against these poorly accessible epitopes are required to overcome the extraordinary mutation rate and the diversification of HIV-1 during the course of infection and to prevent viral escape.",

This vaccine enhanced the recruitment of DC precursor cells to the site of injection and promoted the maturation and the migration of CD11c+ DCs to the local draining lymph nodes. This was followed by the strong induction of HBsAg-specific antibody and T cell responses, even in mice that do not normally generate immune responses against HBsAg or when low concentrations (\u22642 \u03bcg) of HBsAg were used. Importantly, this suggests that this adjuvant could potentially be used in vaccines that incorporate poorly immunogenic antigens or in vaccines for individuals who have an impaired immune system. The ability to protect antigens or other bioactive mediators, to maintain the native conformation of these components at the site of immune challenge and to create a depot effect with the gradual local release of antigens over time is a key advantage for these types of nanoparticles.

The unique properties of certain microbial pathogens and VLPs have inspired and guided the systematic modelling, design and manufacture of novel nanoparticles that use combinations of both naturally occurring and synthetically engineered biostructural motifs to optimize immune responses to vaccine antigens. SAPNs constructed from different protein oligomerization domains have been designed to achieve repetitive antigen display41 (Fig. 2). A customized recombinant construct, which is expressed in Escherichia coli, encodes a single polypeptide chain with two different linked protein oligomerization domains, each containing particular coiled-coil heptad repeat patterns that drive the self assembly of the purified monomers into nanoparticles approximately 16 to 25 nm in diameter; these nanoparticles have icosahedral symmetry that is analogous to viral capsids. Thus, SAPNs provide a repeating scaffold structure to enable the conformational presentation of inserted protein epitopes or domains in a highly exposed configuration that protrudes or extends from the surface of the particle after the assembly of the subunits41. Approximately 180 peptide chains are assembled into a single nanoparticle to form this icosahedral structure. This geometry enables the manipulation of nearly all of the parameters described above as being necessary for VLPs: a scaffold for antigen display and cellular activation that leads to substantial increases in the specific production of high-titre, high-affinity antibodies directed against the inserted linear or conformational antigen epitopes42.",

The incorporation of trimeric coiled-coil epitopes from the surface protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into SAPNs was shown to strongly induce the production of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies after the immunization of mice with these SAPNs44. In addition, the insertion of a tetrameric form of the immunogenic epitope from the external domain of the avian influenza virus matrix protein 2 (M2e) into SAPNs led to the high-density display of oligomeric epitopes in a native conformation and the subsequent reduction of H5N2 virus-shedding after the immunization of chickens with these SAPNs45. Furthermore, the integration of a tandem repeat of an immunodominant B cell epitope from the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (CSP) into SAPNs induced the production of T cell-dependent high-avidity antibodies in mice without the use of an adjuvant. This protected mice against both primary and long-term secondary challenges with live sporozoites without causing parasitaemia46. Interestingly, modification of the SAPN vaccine to incorporate both B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the CSP of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum induced the production of both high-titre antibodies and long-lived polyfunctional interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-producing central memory T cells, which protected mice against a lethal dose of a transgenic P. berghei malaria parasite that expressed the CSP from P. falciparum14. Finally, the \u03b1-helical domain located in the membrane-proximal external region of HIV-1 gp41 was incorporated into a SAPN scaffold to recapitulate the epitopes recognized by pre-existing HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies; however, this approach was unsuccessful in inducing HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies in immunized rats47.",

The adjuvant activity seems to involve a combination of mechanisms, including an increased cellular uptake of antigens, an enhanced release of cytokines and chemokines, a recruitment of monocytes and granulocytes to the site of intramuscular injection, and an augmented maturation and upregulation of CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) by antigen-primed DCs, which promotes their migration to the draining lymph nodes49,50.",

            "text": "MF59 has been shown to be a more potent adjuvant than alum for inducing broadly protective humoral and TH1-type cell-mediated immune responses48,51,52. Furthermore, with respect to vaccination against pandemic influenza viruses (for example, H5N1), M59 promotes protective antiviral immune responses when delivered with relatively low doses of virus-derived antigens. By contrast, the delivery of similar antigen doses in combination with alum results in variable or ineffective antiviral immunity48,53. The clinical experience of using MF59 has been documented in these clinical studies as well as in post-marketing surveillance. Increased reactogenicity, including injection site pain, has been described following administration of MF59 and has been attributed to the increased inflammation that is associated with the enhanced immune response. The ratio of the increased reactogenicity to the benefit of increased immunity remains favourable, especially if enhanced responses are needed, as is the case with pandemic influenza vaccines54. Early-stage clinical trials are currently in progress to study the efficacy of MF59 as an adjuvant for vaccines against other viral pathogens, including herpes simplex virus, HBV and cytomegalovirus48. Intranasal administration of MF59 enhanced serum antibody responses in naive mice but not in pre-infected mice55 or in humans56.",

The adjuvant activity of this nanoemulsion\u2013antigen mixture is primarily dependent on the retention of a nanodroplet structure in the emulsion and on the positive charge that facilitates binding to negatively charged proteins such as mucin. The nanoscale size and positive \u03b6-potential of the emulsion enables the penetration of the mucous layer, the binding to cell membranes and the cellular uptake that together mediate the induction of the innate and the adaptive immune responses58. Cytokine secretion by ciliated epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa and by cells in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT) is followed by the activation and the migration of antigen-primed DEC205 (also known as LY75)+ DCs to the regional lymph nodes59. Interestingly, nanoemulsions have been shown to induce necrosis or apoptosis in epithelial cells and to simultaneously activate the surface expression of calreticulin, which is a signal for immunogenic cell death60,61. These observations are consistent with a mechanism by which nanoemulsions rapidly facilitate the engulfment of dying antigen-loaded epithelial cells by DCs and other phagocytic cells in the tissue59. Nanoemulsions have broad antimicrobial activity against enveloped viruses, bacteria and fungi62,63,64,65 and can be used to inactivate, as well as to provide adjuvant activity, for vaccine preparations involving intact viruses such as vaccinia virus66, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)67 and influenza viruses68. Single-antigen formulations, including the 17 kDa outer membrane lipid protein A (OmpA) polypeptide from Burkholderia cenocepacia69, the anthrax protective antigen70, the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 (Ref. 71) and the hepatitis B surface antigen58, can also be used as adjuvants.",

Fullerenes are molecules that are exclusively composed of carbon and that are commonly used in nanotechnology in the development of items such as electronics, paints and polymer composites84. Fullerenes are globally produced in the order of hundreds of tonnes per year85. Spherical fullerenes are approximately 1 nm in diameter and can absorb electrons through the benzene rings on their surface, which enables them to function as scavengers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)86. When incubated with human mast cells and peripheral blood basophils, spherical fullerenes result in decreased IgE receptor-mediated signalling, decreased production of ROS and decreased degranulation. In a mouse model of anaphylaxis, fullerene treatment prevents histamine release and prevents the reduction in body temperature that normally occurs in mice after allergen challenge87.",

Mice exposed to single-walled CNTs by pharyngeal aspiration had increased levels of inflammation in the lungs and enhanced recruitment of DCs, alveolar macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes. Interestingly, when cultured with stimulatory DCs, both the proliferation and the expansion of splenic T cell populations were decreased in animals that had been exposed to single-walled CNTs.

Bifunctional peptide inhibitors that simultaneously target MHC class II molecules and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) have been effectively delivered using PLGA complexes, which results in decreased cytokine production and a suppression of disease in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis101. PLGA has also been used to deliver LIF, which results in the upregulation of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression by T cells and an expansion of the regulatory T cell population in mice. This effect was not seen when LIF was administered to mice in the absence of PLGA102.",

Interestingly, only the negatively charged intranasally administered PLGA induced immunoregulatory responses, which were characterized by enhanced FOXP3 expression in NALT and cervical lymph nodes, by decreased delayed type hypersensitivity responses and by increased IL-10 expression105.

SLNs are solid at room temperature and body temperature, whereas liposomes and micelles are liquid at these temperatures. Liposomes are vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer with a hydrophilic centre. Conversely, micelles are composed of amphiphilic molecules arranged as oil in water (a hydrophobic core) or water in oil (a hydrophilic core). An active drug is incorporated and delivered by the carrier, which is chosen on the basis of composition, size and charge92,106. In addition, the carrier might be targeted to specific tissues using specific ligands107. Examples of liposomes that have been used as carriers to achieve immunosuppression include bisphosphonates, such as clondronate, to deplete pulmonary macrophages in acute lung injury108 and arthritis109, as well as alendronate to deplete circulating monocytes in coronary artery stenosis110. Targeting of liposomes to specific cells is exemplified by the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to DCs by surrounding the liposome that is carrying the siRNA with a monoclonal antibody that is specific to DCs. This gene-silencing approach was used to specifically target CD40 expression by DCs and resulted in reduced levels of T cell proliferation in the liposome-treated mice111. Micelles have also been used to deliver agents that impair the immune response, including camptothecin112,113. Camptothecin is a topoisomerase inhibitor that was originally used in the treatment of cancer and has more recently been applied to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The formulation of camptothecin in sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) improved its delivery and had anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model of arthritis; in this study, vasoactive intestinal peptide was used to target the SSMs to T cells, macrophages and synoviocytes112.",

            "text": "Nanoemulsions and immunosuppression. A final example of how nanotechnology can be applied to suppress an immune response is the use of nanoemulsions to deliver self antigens114. When the nanoemulsion W805EC is combined with the self antigen thyroglobulin and is delivered to mice, the animals become tolerant to thyroglobulin; this response is characterized by a reduced humoral immune response to thyroglobulin, an upregulation of FOXP3 and TGF\u03b2 expression and increased T regulatory (TReg) cell activity. This is particularly interesting, as W805EC administered with foreign antigens enhances immune responses by increasing antigen delivery as well as by increasing TLR2 and TLR4 activation57,115. The signalling pathways that are activated after TLR4 stimulation include the myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MYD88) and the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF; also known as TICAM1) pathways, which result in the production and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines116. As too much inflammation is detrimental to the host117, the control of TLR4 stimulation is an important immunoregulatory function. Endotoxin tolerance is a mechanism by which immunosuppression occurs in the continued presence of LPS118. In addition, the immunoregulatory molecule TGF\u03b2 has been described as being increased in endotoxin tolerance, as well as in the aforementioned direct immunosuppressive effects of fullerenes89 and in the indirect immunosuppressive effects of nanoemulsion delivery of self antigens114. Another similarity between the signalling mechanisms in nanotechnology-mediated immunosuppression and endotoxin tolerance is a relative increase in TRIF activation and a decrease in MYD88 activation118. This 'TRIF bias' has been described for particular TLR4 agonists such as MPL119, which is an LPS derivative that is used as an adjuvant in numerous vaccines, including licensed recombinant HPV bivalent vaccine120.",

Improved protection against the outbreak of pandemic viruses and other emerging or mutating pathogens will require the rapid activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, ideally within hours (for an innate immune response) or days (for an adaptive immune response) after a single priming dose of vaccine. This could be achieved through the absorption of nanoparticles that have unique combinations of antigens and cytokines.

As many co-stimulatory ligands are now known, multimerizing CD40 ligand (CD40L), glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR; also known as TNFRSF18) or other activating and blocking ligands could turn lymphocytes on and off with greater precision than the antibodies that are currently being used to help to control autoimmunity and immune responses to allergens or even to transplanted organs. Using antigens with NOD-like receptors, TLR ligands and other microbial pattern recognition systems could induce CTL responses to antigens that normally do not produce this activity.

Nanoemulsions incorporate immiscible components such as oil and water that might form amphiphilic molecules such as micelles (part d), liposomes with a lipid bilayer (part e) and oil-in-water emulsions (part f). Virus-like particles are self-assembled structures composed of one or more viral capsid proteins (part g), whereas synthetic virus-like particles are self-assembled from chemically synthesized components (part h). Examples of the relationship between nanoparticle size and bioactivity are shown in (part i). \nPowerPoint slide\n",

Additional mechanisms associated with innate immune potentiation include Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent and TLR-independent signal transduction (not shown); cross-presentation, which is a mechanism by which exogenously acquired-antigens are processed into MHC class I pathways, caused by the nanoparticle-mediated leakage of antigens into the cytosol after they have been taken up by the phagosome (part d); and the release of soluble mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and immunomodulatory molecules that regulate the immune response (not shown).

Direct effects include the upregulation of homing receptors such as CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and co-stimulatory molecules including CD40, CD80 and CD86, which results in the enhanced secretion of cytokines and increased B cell and T cell activation. Enhanced delivery of antigens and adjuvants might result in apoptosis or necrosis, which enhances vaccine immunogenicity.

Direct effects include the upregulation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), which results in increased cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), prostangandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), and decreased B cell and T cell activity, as well as apoptosis. The delivery of immunosuppressants results in a decreased response to IL-2 with sirolimus, the downregulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) with steroids and the upregulation of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), which results in increased regulatory T cell (TReg) activity when self antigens are presented in a nanoemulsion.
