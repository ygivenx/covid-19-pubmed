            "text": "Synthesis of the antisense strand of the siRNA (27mer) was followed by CpG1668 ODN synthesis31,32, producing a single stranded oligonucleotide connected through a carbon chain linker (Fig. 1a). A 25/27mer siRNA was chosen over the conventional 21mer duplex to allow uncoupling of the siRNA from the CpG sequence by the Dicer enzyme once inside the cell. The asymmetric 25/27mer siRNA was optimized for specific processing by Dicer and was more potent in target gene silencing33,34. Adding either CpG1688 alone or CpG-Stat3 siRNA conjugate to cultured DC2.4 dendritic cells resulted in a similar increase in expression of co-stimulatory CD40 and CD80 molecules, suggesting that CpG-Stat3 siRNA conjugate retains its capacity to activate TLR9 (Fig. 1b). In addition, the immunostimulatory properties of CpG-siRNA conjugates do not differ from the effect of CpG alone as measured by production of inflammatory cytokines in primary cells and NF-\u03baB/AP1 activation in a stable macrophage cell line (Supplementary Fig. 1). To assess whether linking siRNA with CpG moiety would still allow Dicer processing, we compared in vitro Dicer activity on CpG-Stat3 siRNA substrate versus 25/27mer Stat3 siRNA. Both the CpG-Stat3 siRNA and Stat3 siRNA were processed to 21mer siRNA by recombinant Dicer (Fig. 1c). Finally, to determine whether the CpG-Stat3 siRNA retains gene silencing function, the chimeric molecule was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine. Results from this experiment indicated that linking CpG ODN to siRNA did not interfere with Stat3 gene silencing (55% and 49% at protein level, respectively, as measured by densitometry) (Fig. 1d).",

Both the CpG-Stat3 siRNA and unconjugated Stat3 siRNA were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Fluorescein-positive DCs, macrophages, B cells, granulocytes and T cells were assessed by flow cytometric analysis, which indicated that the chimeric CpG-Stat3 siRNA was efficiently taken up by both plasmacytoid (CD11c+B220+) and conventional (CD11c+B220\u2212) splenic DCs, macrophages (F4/80+Gr1\u2212) and B cells (B220+CD11c\u2212), but only minimally by splenic granulocytes (Gr1+F4/80\u2212) or T cells (CD3+) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). This uptake pattern reflects the known distribution of TLR9 expression in murine leukocyte subsets35,26. Intracellular staining of TLR9 in fixed splenocytes by flow cytometry CD11c+ DCs confirmed TLR9 expression (Fig. 2a, bottom right). Unconjugated Stat3 siRNA was not efficiently incorporated into DCs even after 24 h incubation, demonstrating that linkage to the TLR9 ligand facilitates siRNA uptake (Fig. 2a, bottom left).",

GpC-conjugated Stat3 siRNA, which binds but does not activate TLR936, failed to silence Stat3, suggesting a possible requirement of TLR9 activation for the CpG-siRNA to be processed. Further experiments demonstrated that in TLR9\u2212/\u2212 myeloid cells and DCs, while cellular uptake of CpG-Stat3 siRNA was normal (Supplementary Fig. 5), the gene silencing effect of CpG-siRNA was impaired (Fig 2e). We also confirmed the gene silencing effects using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to detect Stat3 DNA-binding activity in DC2.4 cells, which was induced by IL-10 stimulation (Fig. 2f). Note that, as indicated above, stimulation using CpG itself also resulted in Stat3 activation25,38 (Fig. 2f), thereby complicating the EMSA analysis for detection of Stat3 silencing. None-the-less, at higher concentrations, CpG-Stat3 siRNA diminished Stat3 DNA-binding activity relative to the conjugate scrambled RNA controls. To demonstrate the generality of this approach to gene silencing, we used TLR9-positive mouse A20 B cell lymphoma cells to test CpG-siRNA internalization (Supplementary Fig. 6a), and gene silencing, for which we tested a chimeric conjugate linking CpG1668 ODN with a Dicer substrate siRNA specific for firefly luciferase (Luc) in inhibiting luciferase activity in A20-Luc cells (Supplementary Fig. 6 b).",

Our previous work demonstrated that Stat3 is persistently-activated in myeloid cells in the tumor milieu and that genetic ablation of Stat3 in the myeloid compartment elicits potent antitumor immunity10. Furthermore, both CpG and LPS treatment activates Stat338,25,40, which acts as a negative feedback mechanism to constrain Th1 immune responses. Therefore, we assessed whether the CpG-Stat3-siRNA conjugates could reverse the immunosuppressive effects imposed by the tumor-microenvironment and at the same time allow effective antitumor immunity induced by TLR9 triggering. Local treatment with CpG-Stat3 siRNA oligonucleotides inhibited growth of subcutaneously growing B16 melanoma (3\u20135 mm in diameter at the initial treatment). In contrast, treatment with unconjugated CpG-ODN plus Stat3 siRNA, or CpG-scrambled RNA construct, or GpC-Stat3 siRNA had significantly less antitumor effects (Fig. 4a). The antitumor effects of CpG-Stat3 siRNA were confirmed by using two alternative Stat3 siRNA sequences (data not shown). To directly show that the antitumor effects induced by CpG-Stat3 siRNA were mainly mediated by immune cells, we performed in vivo experiments with antibody-mediated depletion of CD8/CD4 T cells and NK cells. Without CD8+ and CD4+ immune cell populations (possibly also the cross-priming CD11c+CD8+ DCs), the effects of CpG-Stat3 siRNA treatment were partially reduced (Fig. 4b). The therapeutic effects of CpG-Stat3 siRNA were abrogated in the absence of NK cells (Fig. 4b).",

To assess in vivo effects of the CpG-Stat3 siRNA on tumor cells, we stained B16 tumor tissues with fluorescent antibody specific to activated caspase-3. Data from these analysis showed that B16 tumors received CpG-Stat3 siRNA had undergone more extensive apoptosis relative to the other three treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 11). We also investigated the possibility that CpG-Stat3 siRNA could be systemically delivered to achieve gene silencing and antitumor effects. Intravenous injection (i.v.) of CpG-Stat3 siRNA (0.78 nmol) reduced Stat3 expression in DCs within TDLNs relative to CpG-scrambled RNA (Fig. 4f). Systemic delivery of CpG-Stat3 siRNA to inhibit metastasis was tested in an experimental B16 lung metastasis model. Relatively small amounts of the oligonucleotide (< 1 mg/kg) were used for the systemic injection, which led to significant reduction in the number of lung metastasis (Fig. 4g). Lower antitumor effect due to CpG-scrambled RNA and CpG ODN alone was also observed. Thus, maximal antitumor effects required conjugation of the CpG TLR9 ligand with a functional Stat3 siRNA.",

Lack of Stat3 in DCs has been shown to upregulate expression of Th1 cytokines/chemokines10,20,42,43, which can be greatly amplified by CpG treatment25. As shown in Fig. 5a, injection of the CpG-Stat3 siRNA at tumor site resulted in upregulation of several Th1 cytokines and chemokines, which were shown to be upregulated by Stat3 ablation10,20,42,43. It has also been documented that DCs with low expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules mediate immune tolerance44, which is one of the proposed mechanisms for tumor immune evasion induced by Stat3 activation in tumor-associated DCs10. We therefore analyzed expression of co-stimulatory molecules by DCs enriched from TDLNs. Results from these analyses indicated that CpG-Stat3 siRNA reduced the number of the DCs with low expression of co-stimulatory molecules, including MHC class II, CD80 and CD40, which was accompanied by a modest increase in expression of these co-stimulatory molecules (Supplementary Fig. 12). Stat3 ablation in myeloid cells followed by local treatment has been shown to induce potent antitumor innate immune responses that involve neutrophils10. We therefore assessed whether CpG-Stat3 siRNA conjugate treatment could lead to neutrophil-associated tumor cell apoptosis. Co-staining B16 tumor tissue sections with antibodies specific to activated caspase-3 and neutrophils revealed that CpG-Stat3 siRNA treatment-induced massive tumor cell apoptosis (activated caspase 3-positive), which was associated with an increase in tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (Fig. 5b). An increase in neutrophils in tumor after CpG-Stat3 siRNA treatment was further confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5c).",

We investigated the numbers of tumor infiltrating T cell populations in subcutaneously growing B16 tumors treated locally for 2 weeks with CpG-Stat3 siRNA, CpG-scrambled RNA control or PBS only. Although CpG-Stat3 siRNA treatment did not induce significant changes in overall CD4+ T cell numbers within the tumors, as shown by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 6a), the percentage of CD4+/FoxP3+ Treg cells within all CD4+ T cells dropped from approximately 60% to 25% after peritumoral injections of CpG-Stat3 siRNA (Fig. 6b). We observed an increase in the infiltration of total CD8+ T cells in the tumor stroma, although CpG-scrambled RNA control treatment also led to some recruitment of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6c). These effects probably result from TLR9-mediated immunostimulation of tumor-infiltrating antigen presenting cells. Fluorescent immunostaining of frozen tumor tissues with anti-CD8 antibody confirmed data generated by the flow cytometric analysis that CpG-Stat3 siRNA treatment caused increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumors (data not shown). Activation of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells is believed to be critical for immune-mediated antitumor effects. We therefore examined the ability of CpG-Stat3 siRNA treatment to generate CD8+ T cells specific for the B16 tumor antigen, TRP2. ELISPOT assays to determine IFN\u03b3 production by T cells isolated from TDLNs in response to recall stimulation with TRP2 peptide antigen indicated that in vivo CpG-Stat3 siRNA administration indeed induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (Fig. 6d).",

            "text": "We have developed a new strategy for targeted siRNA delivery together with immune activation by covalently linking TLR oligonucleotide agonists to siRNAs. These conjugates encompass three activities in a single molecule: targeting to immune cells, which include DCs, macrophages, and B cells, TLR activation and immune checkpoint silencing. In addition to TLR9, several other intracellular TLRs, such as TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, also recognize/interact with nucleic acids, suggesting a broad application of this approach using various ligands for these TLRs to deliver siRNAs into different immune cells. TLRs are important for stimulating DC maturation, antigen uptake and presentation, leading to CTL activation and CD4+ T helper cell differentiation. Therefore, TLR agonist-siRNA approaches can further stimulate desired immune responses for treating diseases such as cancer and infections. Although it has been established that binding to TLR9 is necessary for CpG-mediated immune activation, it remains to be fully explored how CpG ODN enter cells36. Our results indicated that cellular uptake of both CpG ODN and the CpG-siRNA constructs can occur in the absence of TLR9. However, TLR9, at least in mouse cells, is essential for CpG-siRNA-mediated gene silencing. While the exact underlying mechanism(s) remains to be determined, it is possible that triggering TLR9 could effect either endosomal release of CpG-siRNA into the cytoplasm, or/and its intracellular processing.",

            "text": "Although TLR9 is expressed in different types of mouse DCs, its expression is more selective in humans. Nevertheless, while the highest levels of constitutive TLR9 expression is observed on human plasmacytoid DCs and B cells, it is also expressed at lower levels on human monocytes and macrophages26. These immune cells can serve as antigen-presenting cells and induce innate, adaptive or humoral immunity27,29,46. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated recently that adding triphosphate to the 5\u2032 of siRNA can potentiate the antitumor effects of siRNA by stimulating antitumor immune responses, likely through intracellular RNA sensors such as RIG-I or MDA-54. It is therefore conceivable to incorporate triphosphate to the CpG-siRNA to further amplify antitumor immunity. In addition, a critical role of tumor stromal macrophages and B cells in promoting tumor development has been well documented47,48. Importantly, Stat3 and several other molecules produced by the tumor myeloid population, and possibly tumor-associated B cells, are critical for tumor immunosuppression17, and Stat3 activity in the myeloid compartment (possibly B cells as well) promotes Stat3 activity in tumor cells and endothelial cells in the tumor, enhancing tumor cell growth/survival12,21,22,23. In addition to Stat3, other oncogenic molecules produced by the tumor myeloid/B cell compartment are also critical in promoting cancer growth and resistance to various therapies. Therefore, being able to target the tumor stromal myeloid cells/B cells through CpG-siRNA conjugate molecules is highly desirable for cancer therapies. In addition to normal immune cells, several types of tumor cells, including those of B cell origin, and some solid tumor cells, are also positive for TLR949. Our preliminary results suggested the feasibility of CpG-siRNA approach to silence genes in TLR9+ tumor cells. For example, treating human TLR9+ tumors in NOD/SCID/IL-2R\u03b3KO mice with CpG-Stat3 siRNA resulted in tumor cell apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition (Kortylewski and Yu, unpublished data). More experiments remain to be performed to optimize this approach for potential clinical use.",

Work is underway to determine the possible cause(s) of this difference, which might include serum-associated degradation of CpG-siRNAs or reduction of the overall silencing effect in rapidly dividing cell populations. It is possible that in vivo repeated treatments allow accumulative gene silencing effects, and the crosstalk between various cells in the tumor microenvironment could lead to secondary inhibitory effects on Stat3 activity23. The half-life of the constructs at present is limited. Although the CpG ODN in the construct is phosphothioated, which should resist serum degradation, the siRNA in the chimeric construct is unmodified and negatively charged. Chemically modifying the siRNA to prolong serum stability and to neutralize the negative charge of the siRNA to facilitate endosomal release may improve the efficacy of TLR agonist-siRNA approach. Although more studies are necessary to further understand the mechanism(s), and to improve CpG-siRNA gene silencing effects, our results raise the possibility to use oligonucleotide TLR agonists for siRNA delivery into tumor-associated myeloid cells and B cells, and possibly certain tumor cells, to inhibit expression of tumor-promoting/immunosuppressive molecules while activating TLR(s) for immune activation.",
