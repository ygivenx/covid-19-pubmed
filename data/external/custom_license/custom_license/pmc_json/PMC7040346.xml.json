It must be acknowledged that here is little in the way of evidence to date that demonstrates that an empirical approach can eliminate the dangers inherent in human interpretation and subjectivity. The pervasiveness of medical denialism14\u201318, and well-known historical cases, such as the rejection of Semmelweiss's empirical evidence of how to reduce infections in surgicalprocedures24, seem to highlight this problem. The discussions of medical pseudoscience undertaken here therefore need to be grounded in an acknowledgement of the limitations of empiricism itself. The problem of medical nihilism, according to Poland17, highlights seemingly insoluble problems associated with human choices to believe or disbelieve medical evidence.",

Demographic modelling suggests that if the national government had used ARVs for prevention and treatment at the same rate as the Western Cape (which defined national policy on ARVs), then about 171,000 HIV infections and 343,000 deaths could have been prevented between 1999 and 2007. Two key scientific bodies, the Medicines Control Council (MCC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) fall under the ambit of the national Department of Health.

Given the hundreds of thousands that may have died due to the amoral implementation of political ideology in the case of South Africa, describing this using the term \u2018medical pseudoscience\u2019 is perhaps necessary (uncomfortable as the term may be to the academic ear), so as to not do disservice to those that have perished due to the application of this particular type of scientific denialism. Indeed, it would seem that such events pass out of consideration relatively quickly, both by the public and by academic discussions. Those involved in this perpetration live on, with little in the way of accountability. This example seems to illustrate a unique form of pseudoscience, which bears classification as such, and the development of its own stream of literature.

According to Nattrass11 the cause can be traced back to the publication of scientific research, as accomplished (highly respected at the time) academics argued that AZT itself caused AIDS rather than treating or preventing it. An example of the link between these events and scientific publication is Duesberg's10. Denialist members of the Presidential AIDS Advisory panel (half orthodox scientists, half AIDS denialists) asserted that \u201cAIDS would disappear instantaneously if all HIV testing was outlawed and the use of antiretroviral drugs was terminated (p.162)11. Another example of this type of pseudoscience, in the form of medical denialism, or empirical rejectionism, is the spread of the anti-vaccine movement. The link between dissident academic publication and the rise of the pseudoscientific anti-vaccine movement is also seen in the emergence of the populist anti-vaccine movement, which advocated halting MMR immunisation18. This example of vaccine nihilism, according to Poland17, highlights the problem that \u201cthere are no magical solutions to the deep divide between those who accept the scientific method and evidence and those who do not and simply choose to disbelieve the evidence (p.1).\u201d This movement emerged on account of scientific publications that put forth the thesis that MMR vaccine was linked with the development of autism12,13.

This is however evident in a government's refusal to allow treatment of HIV victims with ARVs on the basis of theory developed by respected academics. Similarly, while seminal theory by Lakatos (1970) also stresses how core tenets of fields can reject new knowledge, this theory also relates primarily to Type 1 errors, as does Kuhn's20 seminal work. The Sokal hoax34 highlights the potential for theory to be published by respected journals, but which was specifically formulated on the basis of confounding logics. Further research should differentiate between extreme forms of Type I and Type II error violation. The two forms of pseudoscience discussed here might be taken to exhibit characteristics of these extremes, and that such a characterisation might be useful in differentiating them from other forms of medical denialism.",

At these extremes, a phenomenon is identified, termed medical pseudoscience, a relatively unique form of pseudoscience that takes the form of extreme denialism, but which is vulnerable to those with political agendas or other motives associated with moral failure. Knowledge of this categorisation is arguably important, particularly when healthcare providers and policy makers can be lulled into a false sense of security in deriving policy or practice from dogmatic perspectives of empiricism that do not acknowledge the shortcomings of empiricism, or EBM itself. Certain conclusions and recommendations that derive from this analysis are now presented.",
