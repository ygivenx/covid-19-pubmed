This change in thinking has been driven by an increased appreciation that activation of the INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM initiates, amplifies and drives antigen-specific immune responses. Moreover, the identification of discrete cell types, specific receptors and the signalling pathways involved in activation of innate immunity has provided a multitude of new targets for exploitation by the development of novel adjuvants (IMMUNE POTENTIATORS and DELIVERY SYSTEMS).",

In recent years, however, basic immunological research has started to make a greater contribution to the vaccine development process. There are many factors driving this re-invigorated search for the theoretical and mechanistic underpinnings of vaccination, including the need for the development of safer, better defined and more effective vaccines against a number of important diseases for which vaccines do not presently exist (for example, HIV, HCV, Neisseria meningitides and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)). Furthermore, recent breakthroughs in immunology have revealed numerous new targets and mechanisms of the innate arm of the immune system that can be manipulated by improved adjuvants to produce better vaccines.",

The innate response acts early after infection (within minutes), detecting and responding to broad cues from invading pathogens. By contrast, the adaptive response takes time (days to weeks) to become effective, but provides the fine antigenic specificity required for complete elimination of the pathogen and the generation of IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY. Antigen-independent recognition of pathogens by the innate immune system leads to the immediate mobilization of immune effector and regulatory mechanisms that provide the host with three crucial survival advantages: rapid initiation of the immune responses (both innate and adaptive) and creation of the inflammatory and co-stimulatory context for antigen recognition; establishment of a first line of defence, which holds the pathogen in check during the maturation of the adaptive response; and steering of the adaptive immune response towards the cellular or humoural elements that are most appropriate for protection against the particular infectious agent. So, although the overall objective of vaccination is the activation of antigen-specific immunity, vaccines cannot optimally achieve this goal without effectively activating the pathogen-detection mechanisms of the innate immune response.",

As such, adjuvants represent important components of most of the successful vaccines, particularly those based on subunits of pathogens, including isolated fractions of the killed pathogens, or recombinant antigens. However, as a consequence of the growing appreciation of innate immune mechanisms, and the details of antigen processing and presentation, more sophisticated definitions of adjuvants are required. Therefore, we have begun to separate both traditional and novel adjuvants into two main categories (immune potentiators and delivery systems) on the basis of their dominant mechanism(s) of action2. Whereas delivery systems mainly function to localize vaccine components and to target vaccines to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), immune potentiators directly activate these cells through specific receptors (for example, TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS (TLRs)). So, delivery systems are used to promote the interaction of both antigens and immune potentiators with the key cells of the innate immune system. Immune potentiators provide the inflammatory context necessary for optimal antigen-specific immune activation by activating APCs and amplifying the innate immune response (Fig. 1).",

This non-antigen-specific detection strategy is mediated by diverse and evolutionarily conserved families of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)3. An increasing number of PRRs are being identified, with the ten recently discovered members of the TLR family attracting the most interest at present. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which they recognize are structurally and chemically diverse compounds, but they share the common feature of being highly conserved in pathogens and absent from multicellular organisms4,5. This broad recognition strategy allows the innate immune system to respond rapidly to infection in advance of the more delayed activation of antigen-specific immunity. As such, the key advantage of an integrated system of pattern recognition and antigen-specific responses is that the immune system divides the responsibility of recognizing and eliminating infectious agents by fulfilling two mutually exclusive goals of the primary immune response: speed and specificity6. It is important to note that the optimal immune response required for long-term protective immunity \u2014 immunological memory \u2014 represents the merger of these two competing goals and that vaccination exploits this union with remarkable success (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "Various cell types of the immune system are capable of presenting antigens to T cells, providing a crucial bridge between the innate and adaptive responses. Among these, dendritic cells (DCs) are considered 'professional APCs' because they are highly efficient and are specialized for this function7,8. DCs and other APCs constantly sample their environment through pinocytosis and/or phagocytosis, and use their PRRs to 'screen' for infectious agents. This constitutive process is thought to provide the mechanism by which the immune system not only mobilizes both innate and antigen-specific defences to infection or following vaccination, but also maintains tolerance (non-responsiveness) to autologous or benign agents9. The dual activation/tolerization function of DCs is mediated by their capacity to change the context of antigen presentation and to communicate to T cells the nature of the antigens they are presenting. They do this by responding to PAMPs or synthetic immune potentiators, and producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and expressing co-stimulatory molecules (for example, CD80/86) which induce full activation of antigen-specific T cells. In the absence of these pro-inflammatory cues, T-cell responses are shut down10. It is this better understanding of antigen presentation and APC biology that has provided opportunities for future improvements in vaccine development, as more selective and sophisticated immune potentiators and delivery systems are developed (Fig. 3).",

The direct adjuvant effects on B cells are particularly intriguing and seem to act at three levels. First, delivery systems, especially particulate ones, facilitate an ordered and repetitive array of B-cell epitopes, which results in more efficient B-cell activation through their antigen receptors11,12. Second, although B cells are considered part of the antigen-specific immune system, they also express PRRs (for example, TLRs), and, therefore, can be activated by PAMPs or immune potentiators in ways that modify both the quantity and quality of their antibody responses13,14. Last, B cells can also act as APCs, and B-cell activation by antigen and immune potentiators enhances their efficiency of antigen presentation to T cells, as well as inducing the production of cytokines. Given that antibody responses are traditionally considered the correlate of protection for most vaccines, further efforts to selectively target B cells with immune potentiators and delivery systems hold great promise.",

This is because the pathogens used in the vaccines possess all of the relevant antigens in a particulate form \u2014 a whole cell \u2014 which also contains many potent immune potentiators (that is, PAMPs). However, the trend in vaccine development is to move away from these whole-cell products towards safer and better-defined subunit vaccines, produced as highly purified recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, these recombinant antigens are often poorly immunogenic, because they lack intrinsic immune-potentiating activity. So, the challenge in subunit vaccine development is to reintroduce selective signals for activation of the innate immune response, which will be sufficient to mimic natural infection or traditional vaccination. The immune potentiators and delivery systems used to improve the potency of subunit vaccines will need to be low cost, but more effective and safer than whole-cell vaccines.",

For example, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the epitome of a pro-inflammatory agent, is now known to interact specifically with TLR4, which acts together with other receptors (for example, CD14) found on LPS-responsive cell types (for example, monocytes, macrophages, DCs and B cells). Other examples of pathogen products with corresponding TLR-dependence include tri-acyl lipopeptides (TLR1); lipidated peptides, proteins and carbohydrates (TLR2); double-stranded RNA (Poly I:C) (TLR3); flagellin (TLR5); di-acyl lipopeptides (TLR6); and CpG DNA (TLR9)4. Of the ten TLR family members, only TLR7, 8 and 10 have yet to have a natural pathogen-derived product identified. Cooperation between individual TLRs and other PRRs also seems to be a general rule for natural infections and traditional whole-cell vaccines19,20. Moreover, some TLRs seem to be highly promiscuous (for example, TLR2 and TLR4) and participate in responses to numerous and diverse pathogen products. Intriguingly, TLR2 and 4 have also been implicated in stress-induced responses to both pathogen- and host-derived heat-shock proteins4. These observations indicate that TLR2 and 4 play a more general role in initiation/amplification of the early immune response, whereas other TLR family members, and perhaps other PRRs, have evolved more specialized functions.",

            "text": "Given the plethora of natural products capable of activating innate immune mechanisms, research and development efforts to exploit these immune potentiators as adjuvants have been aggressive. Although in vivo proof of concept has been established for the use of many natural PAMPs as adjuvants, and a number of these have been advanced into clinical trials, the trend for the future indicates an increased reliance on synthetic analogues. This is due mainly to the lower manufacturing and regulatory hurdles associated with synthetic immune potentiators that are highly defined and standardized. In addition, a synthetic platform allows for a more rational approach to the optimization of next-generation compounds possessing greater potency and decreased toxicity. From this perspective, perhaps the most promising adjuvant/immune potentiator platform recently identified is based on a small-molecule approach. The identification of imidizaquinolines as TLR7- and 8-dependent small-molecule immune potentiators (SMIPs) indicates that more traditional pharmaceutical-based or drug-like molecules can be exploited as vaccine adjuvants21,22. Indeed, imidizaquinolines have been shown to enhance antigen-specific responses in mouse models and, therefore, have the potential to be developed as adjuvants for humans23.",

For discovery efforts, the incredible diversity of scaffolds generated through combinatorial chemistry, the ability to target with exceptional selectivity innate immune mechanisms, and the tried and tested drug discovery engines of high-throughput screening and hit-to-lead optimization can now be applied to vaccine adjuvants. Later in development and manufacturing, an SMIP-based adjuvant provides a low cost, highly pure and standardized alternative to all other existing candidate immune potentiators. Given these advantages, and the likelihood that more and diverse families of SMIPs will be discovered, it seems that the imidizaquinoline TL7/8 agonists represent only the first in a long line of future small-molecule-based vaccine adjuvant candidates.",

However, the potency of these delivery systems can be significantly improved by the addition of a vaccine adjuvant, or immune potentiator. Adjuvants are included in delivery systems to focus their effects onto the APCs, and to minimize effects on non-immune cells. Hence, delivery systems can improve the therapeutic ratio of adjuvants.",

So, although many adjuvants have been extensively evaluated both preclinically and clinically, only aluminium salts (generically called 'alum') have been successfully licensed for use as vaccine adjuvants in North America26,27. However, an alternative particulate delivery system, the microemulsion MF59 (Ref. 28), was successfully introduced onto the market in Europe in 1997 to be used in conjunction with an influenza vaccine (Fluad; Chiron). MF59 seems to function as an adjuvant mainly through promoting the uptake of co-administered vaccine antigens into APCs29. Although MF59 has been shown to be safe and efficacious in a wide range of clinical trials30, its early clinical development yielded a number of important lessons. Originally, microemulsions such as MF59 were used as delivery systems for a potent adjuvant active molecule \u2014 a lipidated muramyl tripeptide (MTP-PE) \u2014 that was a novel synthetic derivative of mycobacterial cell wall31. However, the MF59/MTP-PE combination proved too reactogenic for routine clinical use, although MF59 alone was well-tolerated and had comparable immunogenicity to the MF59/MTP-PE combination31. Consequently, MF59 alone was used subsequently and proved sufficiently potent and safe to allow successful product development32. Our clinical experiences with microemulsions served to highlight the need for careful selection of immune potentiators to be included in vaccines. Overall, although MF59 is normally a more potent adjuvant than alum32, like alum, it cannot be expected to be appropriate for use with all vaccines. MF59 works well with a variety of antigens to enhance antibody and T-cell proliferative responses32. However, it is unable to induce potent T-cell responses of the TH1 type, defined by the production of the cytokine interferon-\u03b3, which might be required to provide protective immunity against some intracellular pathogens. So, it is clear that additional adjuvant and delivery approaches will be needed for some vaccines.",

            "text": "In the recent past, we have focused on an alternative particulate delivery system for vaccines, comprising biodegradable microparticles prepared from the polymer POLY(LACTIDE CO-GLYCOLIDE) (PLG). Because PLG polymer has already been used for a variety of biomedical purposes, including the preparation of a controlled-release delivery system for the therapeutic protein human growth hormone33, it was an excellent choice as a vaccine delivery system. In addition, microparticles of the appropriate size (\u223c1 \u03bcm) have been shown to be taken up by APCs in vivo, which migrated to the T-cell area of local lymph nodes and differentiated into mature DCs34. Initial work focused on the use of microparticles for controlled release of trapped antigens, with the objective of making single-dose vaccines35. However, problems arose as a consequence of the degradation of antigens following microencapsulation and during release from PLG microparticles36. We therefore adopted the novel approach of adsorbing antigens onto the surface of microparticles to avoid exposing them to damaging conditions during encapsulation and release. Adsorption was enhanced by using charged surfactants for microparticle preparation, which promoted antigen interaction with the surface of the particles37. Consequently, the microparticles were designed to perform as a delivery system to promote the uptake of antigen into APCs, thereby resulting in the induction of potent antibody and T-cell responses in mice37 and non-human primates38. In addition, the adsorption of antigen on microparticles also serves to multimerize the antigens, and so facilitates direct recognition by B-cell antigen receptors. The approach of adsorbing antigens onto charged microparticles has proven sufficiently flexible to allow successful delivery of DNA vaccines, which are adsorbed onto the surface of cationic microparticles (Fig. 4). Using cationic microparticles as a delivery system for DNA vaccines resulted in significantly enhanced immune responses in comparison with immunization using naked DNA in mice39 and in non-human primates40. In mechanistic studies, we showed that the cationic PLG microparticles were able to deliver adsorbed DNA into DCs, whereas naked DNA was unable to transfect DCs41. Similar cationic microparticles can also be used as delivery systems for adsorbed adjuvants, including CpG DNA, whereas anionic microparticles have been used for adsorbed protein vaccines37,42. The potential of a broad range of particulate vaccine delivery systems to improve the potency of new generation vaccines has recently been reviewed in more detail2,43.",

In addition, mucosal immunization induces local immunity at the sites where pathogens often establish infection. Oral immunization would be particularly advantageous in isolated communities, where access to health care professionals is problematic. Moreover, mucosal immunization would avoid the problem of infection due to the re-use of needles, which is common in the developing world. However, the difficulty of developing mucosal and particularly oral vaccines using non-living approaches should not be underestimated. Protein, peptide, polysaccharide and DNA immunogens are extremely labile and will be extensively degraded and damaged during passage through the gut if not adequately protected. Intranasal immunization is an attractive approach, owing to the absence of acidity and secreted enzymes in the nasal cavity, but also because of the ease of access to the nasal cavity offered by simple commercially available devices. Nevertheless, potent adjuvants and delivery systems will be required to facilitate the development of effective mucosal vaccines.",

However, because these molecules are responsible for traveller's diarrhoea and cholera, respectively, the native molecules are clearly not appropriate for mucosal administration to humans. Therefore, these molecules have been manipulated to reduce toxicity, while retaining adjuvant activity44 (Fig. 6). One particular mutant of LT, LTK63, has recently been shown to be safe in a human clinical trial involving intranasal administration, following extensive preclinical toxicology testing30. In previous studies, we showed that the potency of LTK63 for intranasal administration could be enhanced by co-administration with bio-adhesive delivery systems in small45 and large animal models46. The bio-adhesive delivery systems were designed to retain the vaccine formulation in the nasal cavity for extended periods and to promote the interaction of the antigen and adjuvant with the mucosal epithelium. Recent data indicate that LTK63 might prove sufficiently potent to allow the mucosal administration of paediatric combination vaccines47.",

Needle-free vaccination is attractive for a number of reasons. In the developed world, there are concerns about the number of vaccinations that are administered to infants and toddlers, and it would be preferable if these could be administered without the use of needles. In addition, 'needle phobia' is a significant problem that makes it difficult to convince adults to receive vaccinations. This problem might become particularly acute in the future if it proves necessary to immunize large numbers of individuals in response to a pandemic strain of influenza, or to the threat of a bio-terrorism attack. The problems related to vaccination with needles are even greater in the developing world, where the re-use of needles often results in the transmission of blood-borne pathogens, such as HIV and HCV. Although this problem has been partly remedied through the development of single-use 'auto-disposable' syringes, needle-based injections still represent an infectious threat which must be disposed of carefully.",

Multiple-use jet injector devices that deliver liquid vaccines through the skin were widely used for mass immunization campaigns throughout the 1980s. However, these devices became discredited when it became apparent that they were capable of transmitting blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B51. More recently, single-dose jet injector devices have been developed, which are capable of delivering liquid52 or dry powder vaccines53 through the skin using high pressure. In addition, spring-powered liquid injection devices are available and have also been evaluated in the clinic54. However, none of these devices have yet attained broad acceptance in the medical community and their costs will make them difficult, if not impossible, to implement in the developing world. High-pressure-liquid, needle-free devices have also been used for the delivery of DNA vaccines in clinical trials55, as have new needle-free devices designed to deliver gold beads coated with DNA into the skin ('gene gun')56. An alternative needle-free approach to vaccine delivery, which could perhaps be described more accurately as 'needle-lite', involves the use of microprojection arrays designed to painlessly disrupt the outer layers of the skin to allow the vaccine access to the epidermis and associated Langerhans cells57,58.",

At the forefront of this work are discoveries relating to the presence of receptors on innate immune cells, which recognize the characteristic patterns and components present on pathogens. Recognition of the importance of activation of the innate immune system to the eventual induction of antigen-specific immunity has fired enthusiasm to identify pathogen-based ligands for these receptors as potential new-generation adjuvants to be used in combination with recombinant proteins. A significant amount of work is underway in this area and will likely lead to the development of whole new classes of vaccine adjuvants that are able to control and manipulate the immune response in a variety of ways. It is likely that these adjuvants could prove to be sufficiently potent to allow vaccines to be used to treat chronic infectious diseases, autoimmunity and cancer. However, the potency of these adjuvants needs to be carefully balanced with their potential to overactivate the immune system, with damaging consequences. In this regard, vaccine and adjuvant delivery systems might have a role to play in limiting the systemic distribution of adjuvants following administration. Moreover, the main role of vaccine delivery systems is to ensure that the antigens and adjuvants interact optimally with the appropriate immunocompetent cells to induce the desired responses. Nevertheless, for adjuvants capable of initiating potent inflammatory responses, limiting their ability to act on a broad range of cells could prove to be as important as focusing their effects on key immune cells. Overall, it is clear that pharmaceutical scientists have a unique and important role to play in the development of optimal vaccine and adjuvant delivery systems for systemic and mucosal administration.",
