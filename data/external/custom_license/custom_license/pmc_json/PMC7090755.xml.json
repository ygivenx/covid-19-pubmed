Probiotic capsule included L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus each 5-billion CFU/capsule and Bifidobacterium bifidum 20 billon CFU/capsule. Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline and during follow-up visits 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation.

            "text": "In recent decades, the incidence of AD in children has increased. It is a chronic disease causing itchy skin (Chamlin et al. 2004). Several studies evaluated the effect of probiotics combined with prebiotics; however, the results are still inconclusive and may depend on the severity of the disease and probiotics applied. Wu et al. (2012) studied the effect of Lactobacillus salivarius and FOS on infants with AD. Sixty children (aged 2\u201314 years) received two capsules containing either L. salivarius plus FOS (treatment) or FOS only (control) daily for 8 weeks. The AD intensity decreased significantly (P \u2264 0.013) in children administered the synbiotic treatment compared to the control group. A study evaluated the effect of probiotics on the treatment of children with AD. Forty pediatric patients (aged 1\u201313 years) were assigned to test or placebo group. Both groups consumed two bags a day for a total of eight weeks. The test bags contained 2 \u00d7 109 CFU of four types of probiotic bacteria (B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. salivarius), while the placebo bags contained skim milk powder and dextrose. The combination of probiotic strains was effective in reducing the SCORAD in the treatment of AD in pediatric patients (Ye\u015filova et al. 2012). Recently, the effect of L. plantarum IS-10506 was also evaluated in children with mild and moderate AD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The probiotic function was evaluated by its ability to decrease the SCORAD and levels of serum immunoglobulin. In this study, twenty-two AD patients (aged 0\u201314 years), included in the test group (7 girls, 5 boys), received microencapsulated probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 at 1010 CFU/day, and the placebo group (3 girls, 7 boys) received skim milk, twice daily for 12 weeks. The SCORAD reduction in the test group was significantly (P = 0.0001) higher than that in the placebo group at the end of the study. Levels of IL-4 (P = 0.0001), IFN-\u03b3 (P = 0.006), and IL-17 (P = 0.0001) were significantly lower in the probiotic group than those in the placebo group, while the IgE levels were not significantly changed. Thus, L. plantarum IS-10506 was able to reduce clinical symptoms in children diagnosed with AD and therefore with potential to treat this disease (Prakoeswa et al. 2017).",

The study considered 560 subjects with clinically diagnosed BV. Patients applied the gel twice daily for five consecutive days. After the treatment, the therapeutic cure rates of the sucrose, metronidazole, and placebo gel groups were 83.1, 71.3, and 0.9% after 7\u201310 days, respectively. A second evaluation after 21\u201335 days of treatment showed 61.0, 66.7, and 7.3% cure rates for the sucrose, metronidazole, and placebo gel groups, respectively. According to these results, the researchers suggest that sucrose gel can restore the normal vaginal flora and used as a novel treatment for BV. Moreover, sucrose gel carries less risk of inducing pathogenic bacteria-resistant variants than the currently used antibiotics, including metronidazole. The authors argue that sucrose gel and metronidazole gel have different mechanisms of action in treating BV. The treatment with sucrose gel mediates a shift of vaginal bacterial flora, thereby promoting the growth of lactobacilli, which in turn generate lactic acid that reduce the vaginal pH and secrete antibacterial substances, inhibiting the adhesion and replication of the pathogenic anaerobic bacteria. In contrast, metronidazole gel appears to inhibit the growth of both the pathogenic bacteria and the beneficial lactobacilli. However, researchers believe that lactobacillus will recover faster than the pathogenic bacteria once the metronidazole gel treatment is complete because lactobacillus is more resistant to metronidazole than anaerobic bacteria.",

In general, the study determined that daily intravaginal administration of S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 leads to the suppression of several fungal components that play critical roles in fungal virulence of C. albicans at the vaginal level. S. cerevisiae modulated the expression of aspartyl proteinases as well as hyphal growth-associated genes, Hwp1 and Ece1, in the vaginal cavity. The probiotic effects on the host and the probiotic suppression of neutrophils influx caused by the fungus into the vaginas of the mice are likely related to lower interleukin-8 (cytokine associated with inflammatory responses) production and inhibition of aspartyl proteinase expression. Besides, there was no evidence of any cytotoxic effect either by the probiotic, when used in vivo, on vaginal epithelial cell and organ architecture, or in in vitro in human vaginal epithelium (Gabrielli et al. 2018).",

This meta-analysis showed that compared to placebo, probiotics may be more beneficial for preventing acute URT infections in people of all ages.

The evidence suggests that probiotics consumption can decrease the presence of eczema in children when their mothers have consumed probiotics during pregnancy and lactation. In women, probiotics consumption can be effective in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections. The consumption of synbiotic products can reduce respiratory tract infections and their duration and severity. However, the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies present certain shortcomings, such as the wide variety of probiotics considered in studies, which makes it difficult to identify the individual effect of each probiotic strain. On the other hand, the studies lack standardization, the number of patients or volunteers required in the trials is small, and the cost-effectiveness of probiotics is another factor to analyze. These issues mean that the information reported in the current literature is limited and the evidence is inconclusive. However, several probiotic and prebiotic products aiming to improve consumers\u2019 quality of life are already on the market, such as Sensiline\u00ae, JooMo\u00ae, Lafti L10\u00ae, NeoGOS\u00ae, and others.",

Therefore, well-defined and multidisciplinary clinical studies must be developed.
