PTSD usually occurs after exposure to any event that results in psychological trauma; however, most people so exposed do not develop PTSD [14,15]. To the best of our knowledge only 1 study has explored PTSD public during an epidemic [12]. That study reported the prevalence of probable PTSD cases was significantly higher in older people and in residents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-prevalent regions, indicating that exposure degree and age might be significant predictors of PTSD. The H1N1 influenza pandemic was unusual in that most people could not avoid being affected in some way, since television news, the internet and newspapers were filled with the reports of infection and death related to it [1,5,6,11]. The outbreak of H1N1 influenza caused not only extraordinary public health concerns but also tremendous psychological distress, particularly among youth, as they are among the most easily affected group during a global event [10]. Universities are mass gathering places for youth, which has a high risk of spreading infectious diseases, particularly the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 [8,12,13]. Therefore, an opportunity arises for exploring PTSD in the context of an epidemic.",

First, what is the severity and prevalence of stress symptoms among the students? Second, are there predictors of distress in this sample? Regarding this question, it was hypothesized that greater overall stress symptom severity would be predicted by female gender, residence in North China (where more influenza H1N1 cases were reported in China), lower university grade, having less knowledge about H1N1 influenza, not receiving the vaccine, having H1N1 influenza, having family members, friends or acquaintances having H1N1 influenza, contacting people infected with H1N1 influenza, and being afraid of H1N1 influenza. The findings of this study will be important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, especially in university students.",

In addition, a negative relationship between the PCL-C total score and gender, having H1N1 influenza, having family members, friends or acquaintances having H1N1 influenza, and being afraid of H1N1 influenza was also found in this study (P<0.01, Table 2). However, no correlation was found between PCL-C total score and having knowledge about H1N1 influenza, receiving the vaccine, and contacting people infected with H1N1 influenza (P>0.05, Table 2).",

The university environment has a high risk of spreading infectious diseases, particularly the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1, as it is a mass gathering place for youth [12,13]. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report stress symptoms among university students during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In general, many students experienced a variety of stress reactions to the 2009 H1N1 influenza, and about 2.0% of students developed PTSD.",

This result is in line with the facts that stress symptoms are related to the degree of exposure to a stressful event [17]. In addition, as reported, females are in general 2.38\u20132.49 times more likely to develop lifetime PTSD than men after exposure to similar traumas [18]. However, having knowledge about H1N1 influenza, receiving the vaccine, and contacting people infected H1N1 influenza were not predictors of the stress symptoms. University students of higher grade had more stress symptoms, which was contrary to our previous prediction. It is possible that university students of higher grades may be much more worried about the potential for 2009 H1N1 influenza to affect them directly when they begin their careers [14].",

Moreover, this study may contribute to understanding stress reactions among university students who were involved in the H1N1 influenza outbreak. Most importantly, the predictors found in this study may be extremely effective in defining the high risk group of the university students in similar influenza epidemics. Organizations will need to develop an integrated administrative and psychosocial response to the psychological challenges that are caused by future outbreaks of this nature [22].",
