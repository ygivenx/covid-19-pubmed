            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae [4]. It is an important viral pathogen affecting chickens of all ages. The IBV virion is enveloped, and it genome is a positive-sense, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 27.6 kb [16]. Gene 1 comprises approximately two-thirds of the genome and encodes two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which are translated as the large polyprotein 1ab. Protein 1ab can be divided into 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) and is associated with RNA replication and transcription. The remaining one-third of the genome encodes the four main structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein and the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. There are also two accessory genes interspersed amongst the structural protein genes, genes 3 and 5, which encode the small non-structural proteins 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b [7, 14]. IBV is a coronavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome, and it has high genetic variability through spontaneous mutations and genetic recombination [5]. The viral genome is prone to point mutations, insertions, deletions or recombination, resulting in the appearance of a large number of IBV variants, which confer little or no cross-protection against each other [15].",

The QX variant was first reported in China in 1998 [28] and spread quickly across Russia [3] and many European countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, England, and Spain [1, 2, 24, 25]. These strains evolved to form a new subgroup of QX isolates. According to reports regarding clinical cases worldwide, there is little doubt that QX variants of IBV have caused severe losses to both the layer and broiler segments of the poultry industry. This has posed major problems for the control of avian infectious bronchitis (IB) globally.",

There is some evidence that vaccine strains might play an important role in the generation of IBV variants in the field [10]. If a cell is infected by two IBV strains, it is possible that the progeny virus might have sequence(s) derived from both parental strains [5]. Sequencing of many field strains has provided convincing evidence that a large number of IBV strains are recombinants between different IBV strains [6, 12]. Although chicken flocks in most geographical locations have been routinely vaccinated with live vaccines, outbreaks of IB have been observed in vaccinated flocks. This is possibly due to infection by different serotypes and the emergence of IBV antigenic variants.",

An IBV strain (CK/CH/SD/121220) was isolated from the kidney tissues of the dead chicks.

For polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 10 pmol of each primer were added to 100 ng of template cDNA in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcl. Thermal cycling was performed at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95 \u00b0C for 45 s), annealing (49 \u00b0C to 59 \u00b0C for 45 s, depending on the specific PCR reaction), and extension (72 \u00b0C for 2 min), and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. We analyzed amplicons using 1.0 % (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, with amplicons of the predicted size isolated from gels and purified using an AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (AxyGEN, Union City, CA, USA). Purified amplicons were inserted into the pMD18-T vector (Promega). Recombinant plasmids were extracted from positive clones using an E.Z.N.A.R.

In the S1 gene, the nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequence similarities among CK/CH/SD/121220 and other strains were between 59.9-94.9 % and 48.2-95.1 %, respectively. The isolate showed the highest homology to the LX4 strain (94.9 % nt and 94.7 % aa sequence identity), while the homology to the H120 strain did not exceed 76 %. There was one proline insertion between positions 22 and 24 in the deduced aa sequence when compared with the H120 strain. The same aa insert was only found in the LX4 S1 gene among the 48 reference strains. The nt and aa sequence identity among coding regions of S2, gene 3, M, gene 5, and the N protein gene of CK/CH/SD/121220 and other strain was 69.8\u2013100 % and 56.1-99.6 %, respectively. Strain CK/CH/SD/121220 differed considerably in gene 5 compared with the other genes, which may indicate the occurrence of recombination events. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome, S1, S2, E, M, and N gene sequences suggested that the CK/CH/SD/121220 isolate had a close phylogenetic relationship to the QX-type IBV isolates YX10, sczy3 and CK/CH/LZJ/111113 recently isolated from diseased flocks in China (Fig. 1A-F).\n",

Using network analysis, we determined that the cluster to which CK/CH/SD/121220 belongs is most likely to have undergone recombination. Recombinant strains with published sequences mainly belong to this phylogenetic branch. It was further demonstrated that the CK/CH/SD/121220 strain had undergone potential recombination events in six areas of the genome, including the nsp2\u20135, S1, S2, 5a, 5b and N genes. The start of the 1ab gene exhibited a high frequency of recombination events. Other genes also showed recombination between the QX- and YN-type IBVs, indicating that genomic RNA recombination of IBV might involve more than two strains and could occur in multiple genes during a natural infection. We hypothesize that CK/CH/SD/121220 is a chimeric strain derived from QX- and YN-type IBVs that evolved independently through point mutations and recombination events.",

Phylogenic and recombination analyses indicated that CK/CH/SD/121220 is possibly a chimeric strain between the QX- and YN-like strains. Natural outbreaks of IBV are often the result of infections with strains that differ serologically from vaccine strains. To select optimal vaccine strains, the characterization of all prevalent strains must be conducted.\n",
