To correct or prevent the chronic lung disease associated with this autosomal recessive disease it is anticipated that some level of transgene expression must be continuously maintained.1 This could be achieved using integrating vectors, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and lentivirus-based retroviral vectors2 or adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors.3 The most practical route for the direct delivery of vectors to the airway epithelium is by aerosolization or instillation. However, several studies indicate that the efficiency of gene transfer to polarized airway epithelia following apical application of viral vectors is poor, while transduction from the basolateral side occurs much more readily. Examples include serotype 5 adenovirus vectors45 and AAV2 vectors.678 Localization studies of the receptors for adenovirus and AAV2 suggest that their expression is polarized to the basolateral surface, thus offering a reasonable explanation for this apical inefficiency.",

The most simple intrepretation of these data is that the receptors for these envelopes are only expressed on the basolateral surface. However, there have been no studies localizing the expression of known retrovirus receptors in polarized airway epithelia. The receptor for the amphotropic pseudotyped retrovirus, Pit2, is an inorganic phosphate transporter,12 while the receptor for xenotropic enveloped retrovirus was identified as XPR1, a gene of unknown function.131415 A putative receptor for the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein was suggested to be phosphatidylserine, but it is possible that other receptors or co-receptors exist.16 In the present study, we sought to better understand the limitations to apical gene transfer with retroviruses, using the amphotropic enveloped MuLV-based vector as a model.",

Second, the virion must bind to its cognate receptor. Third, the viral envelope must fuse with the host cell envelope. Following these steps, the nucleocapsid enters the cell cytoplasm where additional steps, including reverse transcription and translocation of the pre-integration complex to the nucleus occur. In previous studies, we documented that MuLV-based vectors pseudotyped with the amphotropic envelope infect human,9 rabbit,17 and rat10 airway epithelia from the basolateral, but not the apical surface. In the present study, we investigated the localization of the Pit2 receptor in polarized human airway epithelia using immunohistochemistry and the expression of a GFP-tagged Pit2 protein. Binding of amphotropic MuLV to the apical surface of airway epithelia was investigated using radiolabeled virus. Furthermore, we characterized components of the apical surface glycocalyx in human airway epithelia and investigated whether modifications of the abundance and composition of this potential physical barrier might enhance gene transfer efficiency.",

To address this possibility, we transduced airway epithelia with Ad5-CMVPit2-eGFP and then applied the amphotropic MuLV vector to the apical surface. To demonstrate that the Pit2-eGFP construct is functional, amphotropic vector resistant CHO cells were transduced with 50 MOI of Ad5-CMVPit2-eGFP. As shown in Figure 2a, CHO cells transduced with the Pit2-expressing adenoviral vector were susceptible to gene transfer with the TA7-\u03b2gal amphotropic pseudotyped vector, while the parental cells were not. This confirms that the Pit2-eGFP protein is functional as a virus receptor and the expression level following adenovirus infection is sufficient to support amphotropic retroviral transduction. However, when we transduced airway epithelia with Ad5-CMVPit2-eGFP and 3 days later applied TA7-\u00dfgal vector to the apical surface of KGF-treated cells, airway cells remained resistant to transduction Figure 2b\u2013d.

Importantly, this binding is blocked by goat anti-gp70 antiserum (second bar), but not normal goat serum (first bar). Since Pit2 is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, we used inorganic phosphate as a competitive inhibitor of Pit2 binding as described by others.19 When 40 mM NaH2PO4 was included in the solution with the apically applied MuLV, binding was inhibited (third bar). In contrast, 40 mM NaHCO4 had no such inhibitory effect on binding (fourth bar). These data suggest that apically applied amphotropic MuLV binds to Pit2.",

In some areas between microvilli, spherical bodies were seen suggestive of glycocalyceal bodies.20 Ultrathin TEM sections revealed a fuzzy, electron dense material distributed between cilia and microvilli on the apical surface Figure 4b. The electron dense material is in close apposition to the microvilli and extends out into the space between microvilli. This morphology is consistent with a glycocalyx on the apical surface of human airway cells. In addition, secreted products of the cells might also contribute to this meshwork on the apical surface.",

As shown in Figure 5g to l, the enzyme treatment diminished the apical keratan sulfate and collagen V components, but did not alter sialic acid abundance. Since the sialic acids are linked to membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids, we speculate that the enzymatic removal of some glycocalyx components exposed the membrane-linked sialic acid binding sites. Therefore, the sialic acid staining signal as measured by WGA lectin binding was not decreased. To confirm that the enzymes removed portions of the apical glycocalyx, we also examined the apical surface by scanning and transmission electron microscopy after the treatment.

Therefore, we used this reagent to inhibit the normal production of new proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans necessary for the formation of the glycocalyx. We hypothesized that inhibiting glycosylation after enzyme digestion might block the formation of a new glycocalyx meshwork on the apical surface. To test this hypothesis, we first treated the apical surface of differentiated airway epithelia with the enzymes for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, 100 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose was included in the cell culture medium. Following enzyme treatment and culture with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, the transepithelial resistance was measured and the apical surface was examined by scanning electron microscopy. As shown in Figure 7a, the transepithelial resistance recovered to control levels 5 days after culture in the 2-deoxy-D-glucose-containing culture medium. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy on day 5 demonstrated that the apical glycocalyx remained reduced in abundance Figure 7b, c. Immunostaining for keratan sulfate and collagen V showed that most of the surface area stained weakly, compared with the untreated controls, while sialic acid abundance was unchanged, essentially identical to the results shown in Figure 5g\u2013l (data not shown).

In contrast to the findings for the coxackie B and adenovirus serotype 2 and 5 receptor (CAR), where the receptor expression is polarized to the basolateral surface,45 we found that Pit2 is present on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of airway epithelia. Furthermore, these studies indicate that the amphotropic MuLV vector binds to the apical surface of airway epithelia and that this binding is reduced in the presence of NaH2PO4, suggesting it is mediated by Pit2.19 Therefore the limitation for apical gene transfer with amphotropic retrovirus is more than the simple absence of the appropriate cellular receptor. Increasing Pit2 expression in airway epithelial cells with an adenoviral vector did not enhance apical gene transfer with the amphotropic retrovirus either, suggesting that the abundance of Pit2 is not the limitation. Potential physical barriers that might prevent the vector from reaching apical receptors are the glycocalyx and other secreted, adherent products of epithelia. Our studies indicate that the apical surface of human airway epithelia has a dense meshwork of material that is morphologically compatible with a glycocalyx. Furthermore, some of the components of this matrix were identified histochemically to include sialic acid, keratan sulfate, and collagen type V. Attempts to enhance gene transfer by removing apical glycocalyx components with enzymes or preventing its formation by growing cells in 2-deoxy-D-glucose-containing media were unsuccessful. The results suggest that factors other than Pit2 receptor abundance limit gene transfer from the apical surface of airway epithelia.",

While the glycoproteins comprising a glycocalyx are typically heavily modified by sialation and sulfation, the composition of the glycocalyx on the apical surface of human airway epithelia is not well characterized. Our studies confirm that glycoproteins modified by the addition of sialic acid moieties and keratan sulfate are present on the apical surface. In addition to this attached glycocalyx, epithelia may secrete other products that also act as physical barriers to gene transfer. These products include mucins30 and extracellular matrix components, such as collagen and fibronectin.31 It was previously shown that the basement membrane of the airway epithelium contains several extracellular matrix molecules including chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, entactin, laminin, fibronectin, and type V collagen.2532 The present studies indicate that the apical surface of airway epithelia also contains type V collagen.

Pilewski and colleagues found that human airway epithelia or MDCK cells expressing the mucin gene MUC1, a complex sialated glycoconjugate attached to the cell surface, were resistant to gene transfer with adenoviral vectors.33 This inhibition was overcome by treating cell surfaces with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid moieties. In studies of AAV2-mediated gene transfer to airway epithelia, Bals and colleagues7 reported that treatment of the apical surface of differentiated airway epithelial cells with various enzymes including trypsin, N-glycosidase F, neuraminidase, N-glycosidase A, and endoglycosidase H enhanced vector transduction from the apical surface. In the same study, the addition of mucin or heparin inhibited gene transfer. Pickles and coworkers4 investigated the effects of enzymatic apical surface modifications on the apical gene transfer efficiency of serotype 5 adenovirus vectors. Polarized MDCK cells expressing GPI-linked CAR were used as a model. Enzymatic modification with neuraminidase, trypsin, keratanase, or elastase enhanced apical gene transfer to MDCK cells expressing apical CAR.4 In contrast to these findings, Walters et al34 recently reported that expression of GPI-linked CAR on the apical surface of polarized human airway epithelia was sufficient to confer apical infectivity with serotype 5 adenovirus. Further removal of glycocalyx components with neuraminidase or glyosidases did not enhance adenoviral gene transfer.34",

Despite the expression of Pit2 on the apical surface of airway epithelia, it does not support gene transfer with amphotropic retrovirus, with or without enzymatic modifications of the surface. Therefore, we conclude that factors other than receptor abundance limit amphotropic retrovirus gene transfer. There are several possible explanations for these results that require further study. The Pit2 protein that is sorted to the apical membrane may not functionally support viral entry while basolaterally sorted Pit2 does. It is also possible that there are additional co-receptors or co-factors required for infection via Pit2 and that these are missing from the apical surface. Furthermore, we have not yet determined whether fusion does occur for the apically applied vector. If fusion does occur, it is possible that steps that occur after the nucleocapsid enters the cytoplasm, such as reverse transcription and trafficking to the nucleus, are not equivalent following entry from the apical and basolateral cell surfaces.35",

Twenty-four h later, the cell culture media (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin) was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 mCi/ml of 33P-uridine. The virus was harvested from the cell culture supernatants and filtered and concentrated by centrifugation by routine procedures. The resultant labeled preparation maintained an infectious titer similar to the unlabeled preparations. To study binding of the labeled amphotropic-MuLV vector to airway epithelia, 20 MOI of the labeled vector was applied to the apical surface and incubated for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. Following four washes with cold saline, the epithelia were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and binding assayed by scintillation counting. To demonstrate specificity of the binding to Pit2, the experiment was performed in the presence or absence of goat anti-gp70 antisera,41 normal goat sera, 40 mM NaH2PO419 or 40 mM NaHCO4. Each experimental condition was performed in quadruplicate.",
