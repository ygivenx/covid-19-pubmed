Nasopharyngeal aspirates from these children were tested for common viral respiratory pathogens as previously described (5). Samples were tested for respiratory viruses by direct immunofluorescence assays with monoclonal antibodies to RSV; influenza A and B viruses; parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses; and human adenovirus. Samples were also injected into MRC5 cell monolayers for virus isolation, and they were tested for HMPV by reverse transcription PCR. Aliquots of samples and of nucleic acid extracts were stored at -80\u00b0C.",

For quantitating HBoV DNA in the positive samples, the 354-bp NP1 PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Charbonni\u00e8res, France). The obtained HBoV-NP1 plasmid was used as control in a subsequent 5\u00b4-exonuclease-based real-time PCR assay performed on a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) with 2 inner primers (BocaRT1, 5\u00b4-CGAAGATGAGCTCAGGGAAT-3\u00b4 and BocaRT2, 5\u00b4-GCTGATTGGGTGTTCCTGAT-3\u00b4) and a FAM/TAMRA dually labeled probe (5\u00b4-FAM-CACAGGAGCAGGAGCCGCAG TAMRA-3\u00b4). Amplification was performed on 10 \u03bcL nucleic acid extract with 0.5 \u03bcmol/L both primers and probe and 3 mmol/L MgCl2 with FastStart DNA Hybridization Mix (Roche Diagnostics). For quantitation, standard curves were generated by 10-fold dilutions of the pGEM-T HBoV NP1 plasmid. Sensitivity of the PCR assay was 50 copies per reaction as determined by dilutions of the plasmid.
