Ecological factors such as human behaviour can influence both of these elements, and consequently ecology has been recognized to have an important role in the emergence of disease1,2,4. In contrast, evolutionary factors including the adaptation of the pathogen to growth within humans and the subsequent transmission of the pathogen between humans are mostly considered in terms of changes in the virulence of the pathogen, and are often thought to have a lesser role in the initial emergence of pathogens4. One exception5 suggests that immunocompromised individuals might provide \u201cstepping stones\u201d for the evolution of pathogens.",

Introductions occur stochastically from the natural reservoir of the pathogen, and each primary case is followed by stochastic transmission that generates a variable number of subsequent infections in the human population. We assume that the number of secondary cases follows a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to R0. Each introduction thus forms branched chains of transmission, which stutter to extinction if R0 < 1, and the pathogen cannot evolve (\u00b5 = 0). The probability that the pathogen evolves and a secondary infection is caused by the mutant is equal to \u00b5 for each of the secondary infections (we note that \u00b5 incorporates not only the pathogen's mutation rate, but also its dynamics within the host and its transmissibility). We use multi-type branching processes6,7,8,9 to describe the initial spread of the infection, incorporating the evolution of the pathogen.",

In Fig. 2b we plot the probability of emergence for three different R0 values of the evolved strain. The probability of emergence approaches the probability of evolution when R0 of the evolved strain is large, and is lower when the R0 of the evolved strain is close to 1. We find that the probability of emergence depends most strongly on the R0 of the introduced pathogen, increases approximately linearly with the mutation rate \u00b5, and depends only modestly on the R0 of the evolved pathogen.",

We begin with a simple scenario, which we call the jackpot model, where the R0 of the pathogen with the intermediate mutations is the same as that of the introduced pathogen, and where only the addition of the final mutation results in an increase in R0 to greater than one. As seen in Fig. 3, increasing the number of required evolutionary steps greatly reduces the probability of emergence and increases its sensitivity to changes in R0. The probability of emergence is approximately proportional to the mutation rate to the power of the number of evolutionary steps required (see Supplementary Information).",

In the conventional view the R0 of these infections must be greater than one, whereas in the mechanism described here it is less than one, and evolution during the stochastic chains of transmission allows R0 to increase above one. In the case of human infections such as HIV1,11,12, SARS13,14,15,16,17 and (potentially) monkeypox18,19,20,21, seroprevalence studies among groups at high risk of infection from the reservoir would allow evaluation of whether crossover events are usually dead ends, as we expect in our model, or whether they are associated with a large number of secondary cases. In the case of diseases emerging into non-human populations, such as the Nipah virus, which moved from bats to pigs22,23,24, it may be possible to conduct additional tests involving controlled experimental infections to estimate the R0 (in this case of the bat Nipah virus in pigs) and to determine whether it evolves during the course of chains of transmission. Such studies may additionally help to identify pathogens that have an ability to evolve rapidly and thus have a high potential for emergence.",

In the case of smallpox there are probably reservoirs of related zoonoses (such as, but not restricted to, monkeypox) from which smallpox may have originated. Although the R0 of monkeypox in the human population is clearly less than one, there are occasional chains of transmission in the human population18,19,20,21. As the level of herd immunity to smallpox wanes in the absence of continued vaccination, we expect an increase in R0 of infections with monkeypox albeit to a level still less than one (the smallpox vaccine provides about 85% cross immunity against monkeypox). Our results suggest that this increase in the effective R0 of monkeypox in the human population could markedly increase the probability of evolution of monkeypox, allowing it to emerge into a successful human pathogen (which, depending on the evolutionary trajectory followed, may be similar to or differ from smallpox).",
