By the age of 2 years, 70% of children have experienced at least one episode of AOM. According to a recent estimate, AOM accounts for 33% of all visits to physicians and approximately 40% of all antibiotic use in children younger than 5 years [4]. Acute otitis media is the most frequent reason for outpatient antibiotic therapy in children in the United States and most other developed countries [4].",

This probably results from including varied subjects and target diseases, since overall age distribution ranged from several months to 12 years and all respiratory viruses often were studied as a group [10]. It is reported that the incidence of treatment resistance or delayed cure in combined RSV infection is high in children under 2 years old.

Although the conclusion that otitis media in children is largely the result of viral respiratory tract infection clearly has merit, it is not clear how this conclusion should affect management of patients, especially the decision to use antibiotics. Further studies will be needed to help practitioners determine which patients do not need antibiotic treatment. Bacterial pathogens were frequently absent (45.8% of MEF samples) and viral RNA was detected in 56.4% of bacteria negative MEF samples in the present study. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that prevention of particular virus infections by influenza vaccine [2, 5] and RSV immunoglobulin [17] has been associated with reduced frequencies of AOM.",
