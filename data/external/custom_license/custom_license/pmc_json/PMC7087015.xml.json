They are divided into five genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, and Nebovirus [3]. Their genomes range from 7.3 to 8.3 kb in size, and these viruses have a diameter between 27 and 40 nm [4, 9]. Among them, noroviruses (NoVs) are known to be infectious pathogens in a variety of mammal species (humans, pigs, ruminants, rodents, dogs, and cats) [19, 26, 27, 30, 33]. In humans, they are the leading cause worldwide of epidemic, nonbacterial gastroenteritis in all ages [8]. Phylogenetically, the genus Norovirus is classified into five genogroups (GI-V). Genogroups I, II and IV infect humans [2, 15], whereas GIII and GV infect ruminants and rodents, respectively.",

They were initially identified in fecal samples from calves (under 7 days of age) in farms with histories of diarrhea in England (Newbury-2 strain) and Germany (Jena strain) in 1978 and 1980, respectively [10, 34]. In the US, two distinct bovine enteric calicivirus strains were discovered by electron microscopy and RT-PCR and later characterized genetically by sequence analysis. Bo/CV186-OH/00/US is a GIII.2 BoNoV that was identified in a stool sample from veal calves in Ohio in 2000 [29]. Bo/NB/80/US, detected in a fecal sample from a diarrheic calf from Nebraska in 1980, is a nebovirus that is genetically unrelated to the BoNoVs [28, 29]. Notably, the NB strain was the first nebovirus to be completely sequenced, and based on sequence data, it represented a potentially new calicivirus genus [28]. It is noteworthy that Newbury-1 virus, which was detected from diarrheic calves in the UK in 1978, also belongs to the genus Nebovirus, as confirmed by sequence analysis in subsequent studies [22]. In the US, other GIII.1 BoNoVs were later detected and characterized molecularly from calves in Michigan and Wisconsin [32]. Previous study showed no antigenic relatedness between the Bo/NoV/GIII.2/Newbury-2 and Bo/Nebovirus/Newbury-1 strains [5]. Another study has shown that BoNoV GIII.1 (Jena) and GIII.2 (Newbury-2) are also antigenically unrelated, suggesting that they are distinct serotypes [23].",

Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg/ml of either CV186-OH/00/US or NB/80/US VLPs or with semi-purified Sf9 cell supernatant as a negative control in 0.05M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The VLPs were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT) with two Gn calf hyperimmune antisera, Bo9114 (1:500) and Bo12611 (1:500), against CV186-OH/00/US and NB/80/US, respectively. A goat polyclonal antibody to bovine IgG (whole IgG) and conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was diluted in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) containing 0.05 % Tween-20. The antibody-containing plates were incubated 1.5 h at RT. Color development was done by adding tetramethylbenzidine (KPL) and incubating the samples for 15 to 20 min at RT, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1.8 N H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).",

Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nalgene Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with either CV186-OH/00/US or NB/80/US VLPs or with semi-purified Sf9 cell proteins as a negative control in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Serial twofold dilutions of serum samples in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) (ranging from 1:25 to >1:51,200) were applied, and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. One positive serum (for either CV186-OH/00/US or NB/80/US) from convalescent gnotobiotic calves and five negative control sera (feedlot and veal calf sera testing negative) were used for each microtiter plate. Horseradish-peroxidase-labeled goat anti-bovine IgG (KPL) was added to each well of the microtiter plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The substrate 2,2\u2019-azino-di (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) plus 1:1000 hydrogen peroxide was applied to each well, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured using an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Co.). Absorbance values were calculated by subtracting the absorbance of sera in wells coated with Sf9 cell proteins from the absorbance of sera in VLP-coated wells. Paired positive and negative wells with a resulting difference in absorbance greater than the cutoff value (average value for absorbance of negative control samples plus three times the standard deviation) were considered positive for CV186-OH/00/US or NB/80/US virus antibodies. The antibody titers were calculated and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution positive for CV186-OH/00/US or NB/80/US virus IgG antibodies.",

Furthermore, there have been no studies on the seroprevalence of nebovirus. Our retrospective serological study demonstrates a high seroprevalence (up to 100 %) of antibodies to GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus in cattle from 1999 to 2001 in the US, indicating that these two viruses were endemic in cattle during the period tested. However, further serological surveys of contemporary serum samples are needed to determine if these viruses remain endemic in US cattle. The distribution of nebovirus is unknown, and these viruses have been detected in the US, UK, France, Italy, and Tunisia [7, 13, 18, 22, 28]. In contrast, the distribution of GIII.1 and GIII.2 BoNoVs appears to be worldwide. Bovine NoVs have been detected in North and South America, Asia, and Europe [1, 14, 16, 18, 21, 25, 29, 34]. The prevalence is likely to be variable, depending on the location and the diagnostic test used. In addition, our study demonstrates that the GIII.2 BoNoV CV186-OH/00/US strain and the nebovirus NB/80/US strain are antigenically unrelated, which coincides with data reported previously showing no antigenic relatedness between the GIII.2 BoNoV Newbury-2/76/UK strain and the nebovirus Newbury-1/76/UK strain [5].",

            "text": "The seroprevalence rates for GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus in the feedlot calves tested ranged from 78 to 100 % on arrival at the feedlots, which indicates that most animals had been exposed to this virus previously. In the US, feedlot calves are usually assembled in order-buyer barns. After the animals are purchased, they may be transported long distances and commingled with animals assembled from other farms into feedlots. During this shipping and commingling process, calves become naturally infected with many pathogens whose spread may be enhanced by stressful conditions during the transport and close confinement. Based on this calf collection system practiced in auction barns in the US, where animals are purchased from different regions of the country, it can be inferred from the samples tested that both GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus infections are widespread in the feedlot calves in the areas of the US represented. It is notable that a majority of feedlot calves tested had antibodies to both viruses, indicating that infection of US calves with both of these viruses is common. Consistent with our current findings of archival samples (1999-2001), recent studies in Germany and in the UK have shown that GIII.1 (Jena) and GIII.2 (Newbury-2) BoNoVs are endemic in cattle in those countries, with seroprevalence rates ranging from 66 to 99 % [6, 24]. Likewise, a recent study in Belgium has shown that GIII.2 BoNoVs are endemic in the cattle of that country, with a detected seroprevalence rate of 93 % for the group of calves studied [21]. Such high seroprevalence rates are expected for BoNoVs because these viruses are stable, highly contagious, and easily transmitted [12, 17]. Human NoVs are also stable in the environment, and the infectious dose may be as low as 10-100 virus particles [15]. The high seroprevalence rates may also reflect the prolonged shedding of BoNoVs in the feces as detected in conventional or gnotobiotic calves infected with GIII.2 BoNoVs [12, 16, 17].",

On the other hand, the OH veal calves had lower titers and seropositive increase rates than the feedlot calves; this could reflect the influence of repeated exposures in older cattle. Similar results were observed in a recent study in Belgium, where antibody levels against GIII.2 BoNoV were higher in adult cattle (older than 1 year) than in younger calves [21]. Repeated exposures have been thought to be necessary in humans for longer-lasting immunity against norovirus infections [20], and evidence for high rates of infection and re-infections of humans with NoVs has been reported [20].",

Indeed, several of these calves had declining titers by day 35 after arrival.

The increased seropositive rates of calves to nebovirus or GIII.2 BoNoV also indicate that cattle might be infected at a young age and re-exposed to either virus at auction barns or in feedlots. However, further serological surveys of contemporary serum samples are needed to determine if these viruses remain endemic in US cattle.

The VLPs of Bo/CV186-OH/00/US and Bo/NB/80/US strains were expressed using the baculovirus expression system and were used in ELISA to measure IgG antibodies",
