In the late part of the renal distal convoluted tubule, sodium is predominately reabsorbed via the electrogenic amiloride-sensitive ENaC. In the connecting tube, and the collecting duct, ENaC is the only pathway for retaining salt, and ENaC controls renal sodium excretion and provides the driving force for potassium secretion through the renal outer medullary potassium channel7. Loss-of-function ENaC genetic variants lead to low blood pressure, while gain-of-function mutants have been identified in Liddle's syndrome, which is characterized by increased ENaC abundance, augmented opening time, and consequent salt retention, and eventually volume-expended hypertension8. An autosomal recessive form of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is caused by mutations in ENaC, with usually severe and persisting multiorgan symptoms 9.",

A rapidly increase in extracellular sodium ions to a physiological concentration (150 mM for mammals and 100mM for amphibians) generates a maximal peak current in seconds, and then the permeability of ENaC to Na+ ions is gradually reduced to a relatively stable level with a current level of approximately half of the maximal value. This phenomenon is called extracellular sodium self-inhibition of ENaC activity. It differs from the down-regulation of ENaC activity by slowly accumulating intracellular Na+ content in a feedback manner. External Na+ self-inhibition is a crucial mechanism to limit overwhelming salt absorption to prevent a quick raise in epithelial cell volume and blood pressure. It maintains salt and fluid homeostasis at the luminal surface of the respiratory system to keep normal cilia beating in the airways, hyperpolarize apical membrane, and finely adjust fluid volume to host leukocytes and physiological regulators as the forefront battle against noxious aspirated insults 22.",

ENaC mutations that abolished self-inhibition (\u03b2\u0394V348 and \u03b3H233R) almost completely eliminated CPT-cAMP mediated activation. In contrast, mutations that both enhanced self-inhibition and elevated CPT-cAMP sensitivity increased the stimulating effects of the compound. Our above data confirmed that CPT-cAMP acts as a ligand to regulate heterologous ENaC by relieving self-inhibition. Edelheit et al 23 studied alanine mutations in 17 conserved charged residues of ENaC and found that these residues are involved in conformational changes that lead to channel constriction and to the sodium self-inhibition response upon sodium ion flooding. Similarly, our recent data showed that elimination of self-inhibition of \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-ENaC may be a novel mechanism for CPT-cGMP to stimulate salt reabsorption in the human epithelium (Figure 3) 24.",

Both point mutations of the putative consensus PKG phosphorylation sites and truncation of entire cytosolic NH2- and COOH-terminal tails of ENaC did not alter the response to CPT-cGMP. The ENaC activity was activated to the same extent by CPT-cGMP in cells in which PKGII expression was knocked down using small interfering RNA. As we demonstrated, the parachlorophenylthio moiety and ribose 2'-hydroxy group of CPT-cGMP are crucial for activating ENaC 16, and CPT-cGMP may serve as a novel ENaC ligand in addition to activating the PKG signal. The strict requirement for both parachlorophenylthio and the ribose 2'-hydroxy groups helps to clarify the basis for the inconsistent results observed with the regulation of ENaC by a variety of cGMP analogs (Figure 4).",

In addition to Zn, extracellular chloride 26, temperature27, 28, halogenated gases 27-29, sulfhydryl group-modifying reagents (e.g., p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate, pCMPS and p-chloromercuribenzoate, pCMB) 30, p-chloromercuribenzoate benzimidazolylguanidine 30-33, protons 26, cupper 34, and proteases 28, 35, 36 are also proposed to modulate ENaC-gating by relieving sodium self-inhibition. A classic earlier review summarized most of these reagents27,37,38. Non-cleaved channels have a low intrinsic open probability that may reflect enhanced channel inhibition by external sodium, and cleavage at a minimum of two sites within the \u03b1- or \u03b3-ENaC subunits is required to activate the channel, presumably by releasing inhibitory fragments 39. The extent of ENaC proteolysis is dependent on channel residency time at the plasma membrane, as well as on the balance between levels of expression of proteases that activate epithelial sodium channels and inhibitors of these proteases. For example, furin cleavage of ENaC subunits activates the channels by relieving sodium self-inhibition, and this activation requires that the \u03b1-ENaC subunit be cleaved twice35.",

ENaC is responsible for the reabsorption of sodium through the apical membrane of the connecting tubule and the collecting duct, and plays a key role in controlling sodium balance, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure 44. Regulated epithelial sodium channel proteolysis has been observed in rat kidney and in human airway epithelia.

An autosomal recessive form of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 is caused by mutations in ENaC, and is usually associated with severe and persisting multiorgan symptoms. The relief of self-inhibition by CPT-cAMP contributes to the acute effects, in addition to the well-known cAMP-PKA signal pathway 14.

This critical process is sensitive to aspirated pollutants, allergens, pathogens, and bacterial endotoxins. In addition to increased leaking through alveolar microvascular endothelium (indirect ALI), lung edema ususally results from reduced edema fluid resolution via ENaC (direct ALI). ENaC is a promising target for developing new therapeutical strategies to alleviate lung edema, at least for the phenotype of direct ALI 52, 53.",

            "text": "Human serum cGMP level is 6 nM and 3-time greater in human bronchoalveolar lavage 54. It appears that cGMP may serve as an autocrine and paracrine to regulate ENaC function. However, the effective dose for CPT-cGMP and CPT-cAMP to blunt self-inhibition is micromolar, suggesting an uncertain physiological role for cGMP and analogs. A large dose of cGMP compound (1 mg/kg) was administered to patients as reported by two clinical trials 55, and numerous preclinical studies (from 100 \u00b5M to 2 mM) 56-58. It is therefore feasible to apply aerosolized nucleotides to mitigate edematous lung injury. We have demonstrated that CPT-cGMP up-regulates ENaC via two mechanisms: release self-inhibition externally and activates ENaC through cGMP/cGKII pathway intracellularly 24. Thus, these compounds could regulate sodium absorption via either or both mechanisms in a cell permeability-dependent manner. Administration of cAMP could be a potent pharmaceutical treatment for edematous lung injury 59, and cGMP may have similar potential. cGMP increased in murine and rat lungs both in vivo and in vitro following NO application 60, and increased cGMP may augment the cGMP-sensitive pathway for lung fluid removal from alveolar sacs 61. Our previous study demonstrated for the first time that PKGII is an ENaC activator in non-ciliated bronchial secretory cells 15. Accordingly, upregulation of the rate-limiting ENaCs in respiratory epithelial cells by specific PKGII activators may be a potent clinicopharmaceutical strategy for alleviating airspace flooding in fatal edematous lung diseases. The observation of our previous study that specific moieties of 8-pCPT-cGMP are required for activating ENaC may provide pivotal information for developing potential ENaC channel openers structurally related to 8-pCPT-cGMP, which would be extremely useful for treating diseases associated with lower ENaC function. We postulate that when the tight epithelial layer is damaged, for example, in injured lungs, even though the mixture of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagens, albumin, and fibrins, will seal the epithelial cell-free alveolar surface, the potency of ENaC stimulator will be limited significantly. Therefore, the integrity of the tight alveolar epithelium should be a key factor to be considered for the usage of ENaC agonists. The anticipated restore of alveolar fluid clearance may be seen at the earlier stage of ALI and lung edema mainly caused by injured pulmonary vasculature or post regeneration of alveolar epithelium by stem cells/progenitors.",
