It is transmitted mainly by feco-oral route and occasionally by zoonotic infection [1]. HEV-infecting human, belongs to the family Hepeviridae, genus Orthohepevirus, and species Orthohepevirus A [2]. HEV virion is non-enveloped and spherical, exhibiting icosahedral symmetry. Its genome is a positive-sense RNA of \u223c7.2 kb with a 5\u2032-methylguanosine cap and a 3\u2032 poly (A) stretch. It contains 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 Non-Coding Regions (NCRs) and three open reading frames (ORFs)\u2014called as ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3, which encode nonstructural polyprotein, capsid protein, and a small phosphoprotein, respectively [3].",

            "text": "ORF1-encoded nonstructural polyprotein (pORF1) is approximately 1693 amino acid long and has multiple domains, namely: Methyltransferase, Y domain, Protease, X-domain (Macro domain), Helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [4]. Functional characterization of individual domains has been done by cloning, partial purification, and in vitro biochemical assays. Amino acid (aa) region 1\u2013979 of the pORF1 has been shown to be responsible for capping of HEV genomic RNA [5]. Protease domain, aa 433\u2013592, deubiquitinates both RIG-I and TBK-1 proteins, and ubiquitination is known to be a key step in the activation of these proteins for poly (I:C)-induced type I interferon (IFN) synthesis [6]. Macro domain, aa 775\u2013960, binds to poly (A) and poly ADP-ribose and catalyzes hydrolysis of ADP-ribose1\u2033-phosphate [7]. Helicase domain, aa 960\u20131204, hydrolyzes nucleotide triphosphates and unwinds RNA duplexes with 5\u2032 overhangs. It also possesses RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity [8, 9]. The RdRp domain, aa 1207\u20131693, can bind to 3\u2032 end of HEV genomic RNA and has the ability to synthesize complementary RNA strand [10]. Although these proteins are functionally characterized, their role during virus replication and pathogenesis are still not well defined.",

Macro domains may vary in their binding affinities and forms of ADP-ribose bound [17].

After binding of Tf-iron complex to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), iron is released from Tf in cells. It is then reduced to ferrous ion (Fe2+) form and transported across endosomal membranes by a divalent metal transporter protein (DMT1), also known as Ferroportin (Fpn) and becomes part of the Labile Cell Iron (LCI) pool. Free iron can be utilized for metabolism, stored in oxidized form (Fe3+) in ferritin, or released back to extracellular space.

By sequestering free iron in cells, ferritin serves dual function of iron detoxification and storage. It is composed of 24 subunits of light (FTL) and heavy (FTH) chain polypeptides with different proportion in different tissues [35]. Liver ferritin is mainly composed of light chain subunits of 175 amino acids [36, 37]. Viral macro domain proteins are known to bind to ADPR/poly ADPR moieties. As none of the amino acid residues in FTL are known to be ADP ribosylated, interaction between FTL and HEV-macro domain was intriguing. It indicated possible significance of this interaction in cellular iron metabolism.",

Alteration in expression of iron regulatory proteins during viral infections are reported [45\u201348]. Ferritin has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain viruses. It protects shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei from white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection by inhibiting virus replication, presumably by reducing iron availability [49]. Protein kinase 1 of WSSV interacts with shrimp ferritin and prevents it from iron loading, and thus stabilizes the cellular labile iron pool. This may be an assault mechanism of WSSV to counteract the host cell\u2019s iron-withholding defense mechanism [50]. Ferritin synthesis has been reported to be increased in mengovirus-infected cells to combat with the increased levels of free iron after virus infection [51]. Leader protein of mengovirus suppresses iron/ferritin-mediated NF-\u03baB activation and subsequent suppression of alpha/beta interferon production in the infected cells [52].",

Irrespective of the increase in HEV replication (seen with Renilla luciferase activity), level of ferritin secretion remained constant for up to 6 days, suggesting important role of ORF1 domains in keeping check on ferritin secretion. It is necessary to analyze the significance of reduced ferritin secretion by HEV-macro domain.

However, it has ability to inhibit secretion of ferritin. Cytokines seem to play an important role in ferritin turnover. Ferritin levels are known to increase in viral infections. Our study suggests that by directly interacting with FTL, HEV-macro domain inhibits its secretion and possibly suppresses innate immune response. Further, this interaction may also help in keeping the free iron level in cells, probably required for HEV genome replication. It may be a survival strategy of the virus.
