URTI usually presents with a prodrome known as the \u201ccommon cold,\u201d involving headache, myalgia, sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough, hoarseness, sore and scratchy throat, and sometimes fever [1]. The common cold is the number one reason for doctor visits in the United States [1]. On average, healthy adults will experience between two and four URTIs every year, which last from 7 to 14 days each [1]. The most common etiologies are rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus; however, these entities are clinically indistinguishable, and a specific virologic diagnosis does not alter medical management [1, 2].",

This leads to a decrease in the functional residual capacity and residual volume. There is a transition from abdominal to thoracic breathing and an increase in minute ventilation, resulting in a mild respiratory alkalosis, which allows for better gas exchange across the placenta [3]. When a pregnant woman experiences a respiratory infection, the fetus can be negatively impacted due to its unique sensitivity to hypoxemia and acidosis. This dangerous combination has been shown to stimulate preterm labor in the second half of pregnancy [4]. Additionally, there is an increase in oxygen requirement and critical closing volume, which, in conjunction, make respiratory disease more severe in pregnancy [4].",

Simultaneously, B-cells are also activated, and they begin to make cell-coating antibodies. Together, the tagging of the pathogen by B-cell\u2019s antibodies and the bactericidal instincts of the macrophages lead to pathogen removal, if all goes according to plan.",

There is a much higher chance of hypoxemia and acidosis due to the severity and depth of the infection. Pregnant women with pneumonia are at risk for various medical complications, such as meningitis, pericarditis, empyema, and endocarditis. Therefore, pregnant women with pneumonia are usually hospitalized and monitored. Pneumonia has been linked to low birth weight, fetal distress, and preterm birth [8, 9].",

This investigation revealed that only those women with ear\u2013nose\u2013throat infections (URTIs) had an increased rate of SPTD.

Pregnant women are highly affected by influenza, and even the yearly H1N1 influenza strains of less virulence have historically resulted in higher mortality and morbidity in the pregnant population [9]. The results from the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) published by Pierce et al. show that H1N1 infection in pregnant women requiring hospitalization was also linked to an increased rate of PTDs [15]. According to the UKOSS, the factors found to increase a woman\u2019s risk for PTD were admission to the intensive care unit and secondary pneumonia infection [15].

This vaccine is not currently well utilized by the pregnant population. The American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics (ACOG) and the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend universal vaccination for pregnant women at all gestational ages [19]. However, currently, only 13 %\u201334 % of pregnant women are vaccinated [20].

Initially, using mice models, they noted that inflammation is crucially linked to the process of preterm labor and, specifically, the process of cervical ripening that leads to preterm labor and delivery [21\u2022]. Subsequently, they further elucidated the role of the complement system, a component of the innate immune system responsible for assisting phagocytic cells in identifying and eliminating pathogens. Complement activation occurs uniquely in preterm labor, and not in the process of normal term labor and delivery [22]. This finding suggests that the inflammatory state present in preterm labor and delivery is potentially the catalyst that triggers cervical ripening preterm and allows for preterm labor to occur. However, it was noted that the mechanism through which preterm and term cervical remodeling occurs is identical; it is simply the trigger that was shown to be different [22, 23].",

Primarily, it is believed that cervical shortening can progress and lead to eventual cervical funneling, which is often, but not always, followed by preterm labor itself. However, as of late, Kim et al. have brought into question whether or not cervical changes are necessary for preterm birth to occur. They have questioned the medical criteria necessary for a diagnosis of preterm labor. The suspicions are based upon the fact that when sampling amniotic fluid of women who have preterm contractions, but not cervical change, it is noted that the women who had culture-confirmed infection had elevated rates of PTD and overall morbidity [24]. This observation led to questioning the belief that cervical change is a necessary process in the early stages of preterm labor and, when quantified, can predict rates of PTD. This sparked further investigation into the inflammatory states present in pregnancies with poor outcomes.",

One of the changes that occur in pregnancy is a reduction in the immune response, particularly in regard to cell-mediated immunity and the Th1 response [4, 6]. It is thought that this change is one of the ways in which the body prevents a graft-versus-fetus response in the mother. However, when the immune system remains robust in this regard, one of the possible results is a condition referred to as chronic chorioamnionitis. This is a condition defined by a pathology report postdelivery that shows a lymphocytic infiltration of the chorioamniotic membranes. In the research of Lee et al., chronic chorioamnionitis was found in more than one third of spontaneous PTDs [25]. This inflammatory lesion, along with vilitis of the placenta of unknown etiology, has been found to resemble allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease of the fetus in their immunologic markers [25]. Thus, the inflammatory environment referred to as a precursor of preterm labor and delivery may be intimately related to chronic chorioamnionitis. It would be beneficial to understand the differences between the conditions leading to chronic chorioamnionitis, which causes PTD, and the infections that lead to PTD. Perhaps the changes in the immune system (or lack thereof) that lead to chronic chorioamnionitis are related to the susceptibility to certain infections, which additionally increase the likelihood of preterm labor and delivery.",
