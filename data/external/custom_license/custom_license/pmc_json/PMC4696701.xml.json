This mutation rate for the S gene was higher than that for complete MERV-CoV genomes in other studies: 1.12 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 8.76 \u00d7 10\u22124\u22121.37 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site/year) (12) and 9.29 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 7.19 \u00d7 10\u22124\u22121.15 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions/site/year) (13). However, more data are required to demonstrate the pattern of MERS-CoV evolution during the outbreak in South Korea because results are limited by a relatively low number of sequences, short selected time points, examination of only the S gene region, and different sequencing methods.",

However, we cannot conclude that deleterious effects promoting spread of infection will occur because of these mutations. Additional genetic information will resolve precise characteristics of the MERS-CoV obtained during the outbreak in South Korea.",
