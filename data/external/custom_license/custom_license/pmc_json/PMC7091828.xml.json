But, not all stress is bad, so it is critical that evaluations of animal well-being differentiate between distress (that which results in decreases in animal well-being as the animal is unable to cope or adapt) and eustress (stressors which enhance the functioning of the animal)7,8. Appropriate selection of assessments of animal well-being can assist laboratory animal professionals as they seek to evaluate and improve current practices9, especially with mice.",

Corticosteroids are commonly used in these assessments, but interpretation is complicated because corticosterone levels are influenced by factors that include the method of sample collection, sex, immune status, circadian rhythm, and nutritional status10. They also increase when an animal experiences extreme fear (distress) or extreme pleasure (eustress)21, requiring the addition of behavioral assessment to accurately determine the state of the animal. Changes in body weight and organ weights relative to body weight have been among the more reliable measures of chronic stress as these measure change more slowly, making them a stronger reflection of the effects of exposure to chronic stressors22,23,24.",

These stressors were presented in a random order and included: (1) forced swim, (2) heat stress, (3) shaker stress, and (4) restraint stress modified from previously published work33. For the forced swim, the mouse was gently placed in a 13 cm diameter \u00d7 30 cm tall clear plexiglass cylinder filled with water at 70\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 F (21\u00b0 to 24\u00b0 C). They remained in the water until they began floating with positional adjustments or 2 minutes, whichever was longer. They were removed, dried and allowed to warm. After 10 minutes of rest, the swim stress was repeated for a maximum of 4 sessions per mouse. For the heat stress, the mouse was placed in a clean cage with no bedding and a wire mesh to prevent escape. An incandescent light was positioned above the cage to create heat in the cage. The temperature was monitored and the target temperature was 85\u00b0 F (29\u00b0 C). The mouse was removed if the intracage temperature exceeded 90\u00b0 F (32\u00b0 C). They stayed in the cage for 2 hours and were continuously monitored during this stressor. For the shaker stress, the mouse remained in its home cage which was placed on a plate shaker that provided gentle, continuous shaking at no more than 160 rpm for 2 hours. Mice were assessed every 30 minutes during this stressor. For the restraint stress, mice were restrained in a 50ml centrifuge tube with air-holes for a maximum of 3 hours. Mice were continuously monitored through this stressor. The actual times and stressor assignments are provided as Supplemental Data.",

It can be run inexpensively without specialized equipment and is reliably robust in the face of individual and environmental factors. However, as should be considered for all assessments of stress in animals, this method should not be used alone, but as part of a multi-faceted panel of assessments that include physiologic and behavioral assessments to determine if changes are due to distress, eustress, or disease status9,10.",
