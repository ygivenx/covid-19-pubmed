            "text": "The potential existence of \u201ctipping points\u201d represents a substantial multilevel governance challenge for several reasons. First, it is difficult to a priori predict how much disturbances and change a system can absorb before reaching such a perceived \u201ctipping points\u201d (Scheffer et al. 2009; Scheffer and Carpenter 2003), a fact that seriously hampers, and even undermines preventive decision making (Galaz et al. 2010a; Barrett and Dannenberg 2012). It has also been argued that even with certainty about the location of a catastrophic \u201ctipping point,\u201d present generations still have an incentive to avoid costly preventive measures, and instead are likely to pass on the costs to future generations (Gardiner 2009, see also Brook et al. 2013; Schlesinger 2009). Second, the transgression of \u201ctipping points\u201d\u2014such as those proposed for coral reef ecosystems due to ocean acidification\u2014can have social\u2013ecological effects that occur over large geographical scales, creating difficult \u201cinstitutional mismatches\u201d as policy makers respond too late or at the wrong organizational level (Walker et al. 2009). Third, institutional fragmentation has been argued to seriously limit the ability of actors to effectively address perceived \u201ctipping point\u201d characteristics due to inherent system uncertainties, information integration difficulties, and poor incentives for collective action across different sectors and segments of society (Biermann 2012; Galaz et al. 2012).",

As an example, recent syntheses of critical global environmental governance challenges in the Anthropocene identify important \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d for institutional reform, yet do not elaborate governance mechanisms critical for responding to nonlinear environmental change at global scales (Biermann et al. 2012; Kanie et al. 2012). This is troublesome considering that the human enterprise now affects systems with proposed nonlinear properties at the global scale (Steffen et al. 2011; Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009) and that the features of global environmental governance\u2014i.e., institutions and patterns of collaboration\u2014required to address \u201ctipping point\u201d changes are likely to be very different from those needed to harness incremental (linear) environmental stresses (Folke et al. 2005; Duit and Galaz 2008). While some of the challenges explored here have parallels to attempts to understand the features of international responses to international social nonlinear \u201csurprise\u201d phenomena such as financial shocks and other global risks (e.g., Claessens et al. 2010; OECD 2011), we are particularly interested in the \u201ctipping point\u201d dynamics created by coupled human\u2013environmental change.",

This is a challenging empirical task for several reasons. First, because the definitions of \u201cthresholds,\u201d their reversibility, and their scale remain contested issues. There is currently an intense scientific debate on the most appropriate way to define and delineate the correct spatial (local\u2013regional\u2013global) and temporal (slow\u2013fast) progression of thresholds (for example, see Brook et al. 2013, as well as debates about the \u201c2-degree\u201d climate target, Hulme 2012 in Knopf et al. 2012). Second, because the number and types of potential \u201ctipping points\u201d relevant for the study of biophysical systems at global scales are too large to be quantifiable, this makes it difficult to draw general conclusions from a limited set of cases studies. Third, while the governance challenges associated with \u201ctipping points\u201d have been studied extensively for local- and regional-scale human\u2013environmental systems such as forest ecosystems, freshwater lakes, wetlands, and marine systems (see Plummer et al. 2012  for a synthesis), governance challenges associated with global scale or global change-induced tipping point dynamics are seldom explored despite their identified urgency (Young 2011: 6).",

Secondly, we explore the interplay between perceptions of human\u2013environmental \u201ctipping points,\u201d international institutions, and collaboration patterns here operationalized as global networks. This perspective allows for a more cohesive view that combines both exogenous (i.e., perceived \u201ctipping point\u201d dynamics) and endogenous (i.e., information sharing mechanisms) factors (sensu Young 2010). We will return to this point in the end of the article. Note that, our ambition is not to \u201ctest\u201d the proposed features in a statistical sense, but rather to combine in-depth analysis of the case studies, with tentative suggestions that bring to light a number of intriguing and poorly explored issues. While the selection of cases does not provide the generalizability of larger-N studies, it does allow us to examine how the theoretically derived propositions play out in the three different cases, and also provides an opportunity to explore around the potential interplay between variables and causal mechanisms. Our ambition in the longer term is that the analysis presented here can underpin more systematic cross-case comparisons (cf. Gerring 2004). In some cases, this comparison could be done with \u201ctipping points\u201d which play out only in the social domain such as financial crises or responses to transnational security threats (e.g., World Economic Forum 2013).",

Hence, it is difficult to know beforehand exactly where and what kind of resources may be needed. As several scholars across disciplines have noted, developing and maintaining a diversity of resources is one way to help prepare for the unexpected. For example, Moynihan\u2019s (2008:361) analysis of learning in organizational networks indicates that the maintenance of actor and resource diversity in networks is fundamental for reducing strategic and institutional uncertainty (see also Koppenjan and Klijn 2004). Bodin and Crona (2009) explore the role of social networks in natural resource management and note that actor diversity is key for not only effective learning, but also provides a fertile ground for innovation. Social\u2013ecological scholars such as Folke et al. (2005:449), Low et al. (2003), and Dietz et al. (2003) also make a strong case for institutional and actor diversity as a prerequisite for coping with environmental change and as a factor that allows actors to quickly \u201cbounce back\u201d after shocks. These proposals bear resemblances with ideas inspired by cybernetic principles about the need to understand the impacts of \u201crequisite variety\u201d in governance, that is, the informational, structural, and functional redundancies that emerge as the result of inter-organizational collaboration in governance networks (Jessop 1998). It also has parallels existing studies about complexity leadership in network settings (Balkundi and Kilduff 2006; Hoppe and Reinelt 2010). To simplify the analysis, however, we focus less on the role of individual leaders, their cognition, and strategies, but rather on common structural properties and aggregated behavior across the cases.",

These resources could comprise both physical and infrastructural investments (e.g., joint publications and monitoring systems), and immaterial resources, like information databases and access to expertise through relations to a diversity of actors. This third proposition does not suggests that the network necessarily maintains the resources itself (which may be difficult given its inherently distributed nature), but rather that it maintains the capacity to access a portfolio of resources of different kinds, and the collective ability to adaptively use these.",

As Young (2011) summarizes it, the \u201c[m]aintenance of feelings of fairness and legitimacy is important to effectiveness, especially in cases where success requires active participation on the part of the members of the group over time.\u201d Legitimacy relates not only to the ability of actors to follow appropriate rules or procedures (input legitimacy) but also to deliver expected results in the face of perceived urgent issues of common interest (output legitimacy) (van Kersbergen and van Waarden 2004). Moynihan (2008) also notes that trust based on perceived legitimacy plays a key role in the coordination of multiple networks by reducing strategic uncertainty (pp. 357). We therefore propose that the perceived legitimacy of the main coordinating actor(s) will be critical for the operation of global networks in this context.",

A clear fault line with respect to this was observed between central international organizations and those representing science-based organizations in the buildup to the climate negotiations in Copenhagen 2009. While most of the activities initially evolved through the work of a few centrally placed actors with modest formal support from the FAO and its member states (Galaz et al. 2011), the network has become increasingly formalized and recently became a UN Oceans-Taskforce, which is likely to increase the network\u2019s input legitimacy in the UN system.",
