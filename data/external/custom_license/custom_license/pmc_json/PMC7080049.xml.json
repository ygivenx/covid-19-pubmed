China is one of the most prominent countries for duck breeding in world, having the highest duck slaughter rates and breeding stocks. Domestic ducks and waterfowl live side by side in the rice fields and wetlands in China, and the common-living environment provides opportunity for contact between wild and domestic birds [2]. The ducks are a reservoir host of mammalian viruses in nature. Many studies indicate that ducks and geese are more responsible for virus transmission over large geographic distances than gulls and shorebirds [3, 4]. Many reports suggest that low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains are more frequently isolated from ducks than gulls and shorebirds [3, 5]. This demonstrates that ducks play an important role in amplifying and hosting a range of mammalian viruses [6, 7].",

The Jinding ducks are known for high laying rate, therefore, we introduced progenitor Jinding eggs of four strains of ducks (A, B, C, and D) from Jiangsu\u2019s Fengda waterfowl breeding field of the national waterfowl germplasm resources gene pool. The ducks were divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D) based on genetic background. In order to obtain the SPF ducks, the ducklings lived in isolation from hatching. We detected the viral pathogens [duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV), duck plague virus (DPV), avian leukosis virus (ALV), avian reovirus (ARV), goose/duck parvovirus (GPV), duck circovirus (DuCV), duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV)] and antibodies (avian adenovirus group III, NDV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes AIV) by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hemagglutination inhibition tests once a month in the first 3 months, then once every 2 months. Once any virus pathogens were detected in the ducks, they were eliminated immediately. Fecal specimens from four strains were collected in December 2015. Three fecal samples were taken from ducks of each strain, and three fecal samples from the same strain were mixed into a single sample. The sample was immediately suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS).",

Viral DNA was isolated according to the traditional phenol/chloroform extraction method, and viral RNA was extracted using RNAiso plus (Takara, Dalian, China) [14, 15]. The extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed using SISPA (Sequence-independent, single primer amplification), with the K-8N primer (GACCATCTAGCGACCTCC ACNNNNNNNN) described previously [16\u201318]. The dsDNA and viral DNA were mixed and detected using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

However, the percentage of RNA virus reads in the total animal virus reads was lowest for strain D, compared to the other strains. Meanwhile, the percentage of Picobirnaviridae and Herpesviridae reads was highest for strain D, while the percentage values of Orthomyxoviridae, Mimiviridae, Bunyaviridae reads in strain A, strain B, and C strain were markedly higher than in strain D. These results suggested that the D strain ducks were more susceptible to viruses. The susceptibility and adsorption of the C strain may be very low for viruses. However, the difference in abundance of each viral family among the four duck strains reflected that the susceptibility of different strains for one viral family may be different. The four strains were divided based on their genetic background. The division genes of these strains may be key factors for adsorption, susceptibility, and innate immune response to viruses. The differences that occur among the strains may be related to susceptibility genes and the innate immune-related host genes [30]. However, Pekin, Muscovy, and mallard ducks infected with an H5N1 HPAI showed a systemic infection with high mortality. Muscovy ducks produced more severe clinical symptoms and had a poor response to vaccination. Nevertheless, the expression of innate immune-related genes was similar in the spleens of ducks infected with viruses [31].
