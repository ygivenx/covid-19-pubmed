Such examples include Ebola virus, Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, which are capable of causing severe, and often deadly, disease in humans and animals1\u20134. These viruses, predominantly RNA viruses, are highly pathogenic in humans and are often linked to an aberrant innate immune activation5\u20138. Importantly, bats, when challenged by these viruses, exhibit no or minimal signs of disease, even when high viral loads are detected in the sera or tissues9\u201312. In addition, they are special in that they harbour a higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders13. Bats also have an extraordinarily long lifespan relative to their body size, despite their elevated metabolic rates14,15.",

NLRP3-mediated inflammation has been causally linked to aging and multiple age-related chronic diseases29,30. NLRP3 is increasingly recognized for its role in response to multiple viruses31, including those associated with bats, such as influenza A virus (IAV)32,33 and rabies virus34,35. Over-activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been linked to a hyper-inflammatory state and immunopathology in viral infection with minimal effect on the viral load36\u201339. However, nothing is known about NLRP3-mediated inflammation in bats. On the basis of the observations of increased longevity and viral asymptomaticity in bats, we hypothesize that the NLRP3 inflammasome, as a central player in viral infection and aging, differs between bats and other mammals.",

This involves dampened transcriptional priming and a lower functional capacity of bat NLRP3. We also discover that bat-borne Pteropine orthoreovirus 3 (PRV3M, previously known as Melaka virus) and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) induce NLRP3-mediated inflammation in mouse or human. Bats have naturally dampened stress-related and virus-induced host inflammatory responses, with implications for longevity and asymptomatic viral reservoir status.",

These then recruit and activate caspase-1 to promote inflammatory cell death via pyroptosis and cleavage/secretion of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) (Fig. 1a). To assess the activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome in primary immune cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of bat (Pteropus alecto) and human, or bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or dendritic cells (BMDCs) of bat and mouse, were tested. Cells were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then stimulated by potent NLRP3 activators, ATP or nigericin, representing a host- or pathogen-derived danger signal, respectively25. ASC specks in bat cells were visualized with a monoclonal antibody specifically raised against P. alecto ASC protein (Supplementary Fig. 1a\u2013c). Quantification of ASC specks in human and bat PBMCs was first validated by confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 1d) and ImageStream imaging flow cytometry (Fig. 1b). Both approaches similarly detected ASC specks formation on treatment of human PBMCs with ATP or nigericin (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1e). To quantify the specks in high throughput, we used ImageStream for the remainder of the experiments. We detected low-level ASC specks in LPS-primed bat cells, with negligible induction in ATP- or nigericin-treated cells, in contrast to treated human PBMCs, mouse BMDMs or BMDCs (Fig. 1c). A key feature of pyroptotic cell death is destabilization of the cell membrane and release of cytosolic contents41. We measured pyroptosis by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and observed less LDH release in treated bat immune cells (Fig. 1d). To examine the downstream secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in limited amounts of bat PBMCs, we used highly sensitive and specific parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted mass spectrometry with heavy isotope-labelled peptide standards42. Levels of human N- or C-terminal pro-IL-1\u03b2 peptides decreased in cell lysates from treated PBMCs, correlating with significantly increased levels in supernatants (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2a,c). In contrast, levels of pro-IL-1\u03b2 peptides in bat cells did not decrease with treatment, correlating with a lack of detection of endogenous peptides in supernatants, despite the detection of spiked internal standards (Fig.1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b,d). In addition, an in-house sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for bat IL-1\u03b2 was generated with cross-reactive antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3). Secretion of IL-1\u03b2 was also lower in bat BMDMs or BMDCs as measured by ELISA of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 1g). Altogether, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is dampened in primary bat immune cells.",

            "text": "Lack of ASC speck formation and downstream activation can be attributed to either the adaptor ASC or the sensor NLRP3, or both. NLRP3 expression is rate-limiting and transcriptional upregulation by NF-\u03baB through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is an essential first step required for the inflammasome activation43,44. We thus examined the transcriptional priming of both NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2, along with classical NF-\u03baB-induced genes IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. BMDMs, BMDCs or PBMCs of bat and mouse or human were treated with various doses of four different NF-\u03baB-activating TLR agonists: LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide) for TLR4, Pam3CSK4 (bacterial triacylated lipopeptide) for TLR1/2, CL264 (adenine analogue) for TLR7 and poly(I:C) (viral dsRNA analogue) for TLR3. The majority of the TLR stimulations induced IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, up to 115-, 67- and 57-fold, respectively, in bat BMDMs (Fig. 2a), 40-, 38- and 39-fold in bat BMDCs (Fig. 2c) and 40-, 552- and 95-fold in bat PBMCs (Fig. 2e), suggesting robust NF-\u03baB activation in these bat immune cells. However, NLRP3 was not induced with most of the TLR stimuli, except at higher doses when it was up to only threefold in bat BMDMs, fourfold in bat BMDCs and ninefold in bat PBMC (Fig. 2a,c,e). In contrast, NLRP3 was significantly induced with higher amplitude for most stimuli in mouse BMDMs or BMDCs and human PBMCs (Fig. 2b,d,f). Despite the differences in the amplitude of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 responses to various stimulations between species, a more robust induction of NLRP3 in mouse or human cells compared to bat cells was observed with the TLR stimuli of similar potency for IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 between species, such as CL264 in bat and mouse BMDMs (Fig. 2a,b), CL264 and poly(I:C) for bat and mouse BMDCs, respectively (Fig. 2c,d), and CL264 and LPS for bat and human PBMCs (Fig. 2e,f). We excluded the possibility of a difference in NLRP3 basal expression level by comparing mRNA levels across bat and mouse tissues (Supplementary Fig. 4). Comparable levels of NLRP3 transcripts relative to housekeeping genes between bat and mouse tissues were observed. Basal NLRP3 expression across bat tissues was 100 to 1,000 times lower than constitutively expressed inflammasome genes such as ASC and caspase-1, which is also consistent with the pattern seen in mouse tissues (Supplementary Fig. 4). Collectively, these data indicate that bat NLRP3 has dampened transcriptional priming independent of TLR signalling.",

            "text": "To characterize NLRP3 and ASC functions, we examined their major isoforms in bat immune cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed only one ASC isoform, yet a NLRP3 splice-variant was identified. The alignment of full-length human and P. alecto NLRP3 proteins revealed 79% identity with two potential start codons in bat NLRP3 (Fig. 3a). De novo assembly of mapped RNA\u2013seq reads from P. alecto splenocyte subsets revealed an exon 7-skipping splice variant in bat NLRP3, not previously described in other mammalian orders (Fig. 3b). The exon 7 region was located within the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3. Both exon 7-positive and exon 7-negative variants were validated by PCR and sequencing from spleen and thymus cDNA. This exon 7-negative isoform constituted more than 60% of NRLP3 transcripts in different P. alecto tissues (Fig. 3c). The four isoforms with different start codons and/or alternative splicing are designated 1 to 4 (Fig. 3d). Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) reporter cells stably expressing human/bat ASC\u2013mPlum fusions and transiently expressing human/bat NLRP3\u2013mCitrine fusions were used for ImageStream and immunoblot analysis. For ImageStream analysis, double-positive cells of similar fluorescent intensity for ASC\u2013mPlum and NLRP3\u2013mCitrine were gated. This revealed that formation of bat ASC specks and their downstream cleavage of IL-1\u03b2 was not different from human ASC, in response to all NLRP3 variants (Fig. 3e,f,i). In addition, the microscopic structures of specks including size, density and shape were comparable between human and bat ASC (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast, ASC speck and IL-1\u03b2 cleavage by bat NLRP3 isoforms was lower than that of human NLRP3 (Fig. 3e\u2013h). Notably, exon 7-negative isoforms 2 and 4 were less functional than exon 7-positive isoforms 1 and 3. The alternative translational start resulted in no difference in activity. Together, these data show that the function of all four NLRP3 isoforms but not ASC is dampened compared to the human NLRP3 and that alternative splicing of exon 7 contributes to further dampening of bat NLRP3 activity.",

To further examine whether our findings for NLRP3 in P. alecto from the Yinpterochiroptera suborder are also true in evolutionally distant bats, we extended our observations to Myotis davidii in the other suborder, Yangochiroptera. Only one start codon matching the second start of the P. alecto protein was identified in M. davidii NLRP3 (Fig. 4a). Similarly, both exon 7-positive (isoform 1) and exon 7-negative (isoform 2) isoforms were identified by PCR and sequencing from spleen and kidney cDNA. To assess NLRP3 function in native bat cells of different species origin, we established P. alecto kidney (PaKi) and M. davidii kidney (MdKi) cells stably expressing the homologous ASC\u2013mPlum reporter construct. Overexpression of human NLRP3\u2013mCitrine in both bat cell types led to redistribution of diffuse bat ASC into specks (Fig. 4b\u2013d). In comparison, the activity of all bat NLRP3 isoforms was significantly lower than that of the human protein (Fig. 4b\u2013d). Importantly, both forms of M. davidii NLRP3 also displayed reduced activation. Consistent with previous findings in HEK293T cells, lack of exon 7 resulted in additional dampening of NLRP3 function. To map the region responsible for the reduced function of exon 7-positive isoforms, we generated chimaeras between human NLRP3 and P. alecto NLRP3 isoform 1 by substituting the human PYRIN, NACHT and LRR domains, respectively (Fig. 4e). While chimaeras 1 and 2 showed increased activity, only chimaera 3 exhibited lower activity than the wild-type human protein, suggesting that the LRR domain is responsible for the reduced function. Evolutionary analysis using 10 bat and 17 non-bat mammalian NLRP3 sequences confirmed NLRP3 was under higher selection pressure in the bat ancestor lineage compared to other mammals and the LRR domain was the only domain under significant positive selection (Supplementary Tables 1\u20133), consistent with our chimaeric functional analysis. Overall, these data show that a bat-specific splice variant and/or an altered LRR domain are responsible for the dampened activity of all NLRP3 isoforms.",

To characterize the bat NLRP3 in response to virus infection, LPS-primed iMACs were infected with H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV), strain A/NWS/33. It is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (\u2212ssRNA) virus, known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome27. All bat NLRP3 isoforms were significantly less responsive to IAV infection, while viral titres from supernatants were not affected (Fig. 5a\u2013c). To validate this finding in freshly derived myeloid cells, we infected LPS-primed mouse or bat BMDMs or BMDCs with IAV at different multiplicities of infection (MOI = 1, 2, 5 or 10). MOI-dependent induction of ASC speck and IL-1\u03b2 secretion was observed in infected mouse BMDMs or BMDCs (Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Although the IAV titre was similar between mouse and bat cells, ASC speck formation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion were minimally or not induced in infected bat BMDMs or BMDCs (Fig. 5d\u2013f and Supplementary Figs. 7a\u2013c and 8a).",

This activation, abolished by pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 with a small-molecule inhibitor MCC95048, suggests NLRP3-dependent activation of the inflammasome by MERS.

Additionally, we discovered that both PRV3M and MERS-CoV activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse and human, which also expands our current knowledge of the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the dsRNA virus group and family Coronaviridae.

The induction of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1 varies substantially between different TLRs within a species and between bat and human/mouse for a particular TLR, which supports the increasing evidence for intra- and inter-species variation in TLRs50,51.

At the protein level, while an altered LRR domain is responsible for reduced function for the full-length protein, loss of exon 7 located within the LRR domain results in further dampened activity. Notably, the \u2018weaker\u2019 exon 7-negative isoforms are the predominant isoforms in P. alecto tissues. Our functional study is supported by evolutionary analysis (PAML branch model), which indicates a positive selection in the LRR domain in the bat ancestral lineage. The branch-site model, however, failed to identify a positively selected residue of NLRP3 in the bat ancestral lineage. This suggests that an altered LRR domain is probably a conserved feature in bats and possibly involves accumulated changes in different residues in different lineages of bats. At the steady sate, the LRR domain plays a role in auto-inhibition by preventing oligomerization of NLRP340. Auto-inhibition of the LRR domain in bat NLRP3 could possibly be enhanced, hence making it harder for NLRP3 to trigger downstream activation. Interestingly, the same priming step for transcriptional upregulation also licenses NRLP3 activation by inducing post-translational modifications including deubiquitination in the LRR domain52. No key residues have been identified for auto-inhibition or ubiquitin modifications in the human/mouse LRR domain so far, and their roles are yet to be determined in the altered bat LRR.",

For instance, in vivo virus challenge with high-dose Ebola virus9 and MERS-CoV11 caused no clinical disease and limited pathology, despite high viral titres detected in tissues or sera. The viral load can reach as high as 107 TCID50 equivalents per gram of lung tissues for MERS-CoV and 107 f.f.u. (fluorescent focus-forming units) ml\u22121 of sera for Ebola virus. While a \u2018flight as fever\u2019 theory55 and an \u2018always on\u2019 interferon (IFN) system56 might suggest elevated antiviral immunity in bats, a dampened STING-dependent IFN response to a DNA virus21 and an inhibitory state of natural killer cells inferred from genome analysis support enhanced immune tolerance16. These hypotheses still largely lack functional confirmation, particularly with RNA virus infection. A recent study demonstrated a temperature-independent replication of Filoviruses on bat cells, as opposed to the \u2018flight as fever\u2019 hypothesis57. We demonstrate here a dampened NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response to three different types of RNA virus in bat immune cells, with no or minimal difference in viral titres. This supports an enhanced innate immune tolerance rather than an enhanced antiviral defence in bats. This may also contribute to our understanding of the role of the inflammasome in disease tolerance in bats as reservoir hosts, in contrast to severe pathogenesis in spillover hosts for many high-profile emerging zoonotic viruses. As NLRP3 is recognized to sense an increasing number of viruses, this finding may have broad application in a great variety of bat-borne viruses or viruses yet to be detected in bats. With the ongoing development of more experimental tools and reagents for bat immunology, a deeper characterization of immune responses in other cell types/tissues and in vivo will provide greater insight into the underlying mechanisms of viral disease tolerance in bats.",

Proteins were reduced with 25 mM TCEP for 20 min at 25 \u00b0C and alkylated with 55 mM 2-chloroacetamide (CAA) for 30 min, in the dark, at room temperature. Before digestion, samples were diluted with 100 mM triethylamonium bicarbonate buffer. Protease digestion was carried out with LysC enzyme (Wako) for 4 h, followed by trypsin (Promega) treatment for 18 h at 25 \u00b0C (1:100, enzyme:protein ratio). On the following day, samples were acidified with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and peptides were purified by Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters). Elution of peptides was performed with 0.5% acetic acid, 80% acetonitrile followed by peptide concentration using a vacuum concentrator system. Vacuum dried peptides were subsequently analysed on an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo) chromatography system coupled with Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo). Each sample was separated on 70 min gradient (0.1% formic acid in water and 99.9% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) using a 50 cm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm inner diameter EASY-Spray Reverse Phase Column (C-18, 2 \u03bcm particles, Thermo). Data were acquired in targeted PRM mode together with IL-1\u03b2 peptide internal standards and peptide mass inclusion list. For acquisition, an Orbitrap analyser with ion targets and resolution (OT-MS 4e5 ions 120k; PRM tMS/MS 3e5 ions 15k) was used. The total area MS1 of each peptide was analysed and exported using Skyline software (version 3.7.0)66. Values for endogenous peptides were normalized by those for the heavy isotope-labelled internal standards.",
