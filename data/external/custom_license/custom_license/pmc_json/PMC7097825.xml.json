            "text": "In many viruses, including both tumor viruses and retroviruses, the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting of polycistronic mRNA regulates the relative level of structural and enzymatic proteins important for efficient viral assembly1,2. Because of the -1 shift in reading frames, the stop codon is avoided, and a single fusion protein is produced. For example, in the Rous sarcoma retrovirus, the pol gene that encodes integrase, protease and reverse transcriptase is expressed with the upstream gag gene (encoding virus core proteins) through a gag-pol fusion protein. The mature products are later obtained by processing the poly-protein precursor1. The -1 frameshifting is found not only in retroviruses3,4,5 but also in coronaviruses6, in yeast7 and in plant viruses8, as well as in bacterial systems1. Frameshifting levels can range from 1% to over 30% in different systems to produce gene products in a functionally appropriate ratio. However, the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting is not understood. It is postulated that a complex mRNA structure six to eight nucleotides downstream from the 'slippery sequence', in many cases a pseudoknot, leads to ribosomal pausing and the simultaneous slippage of both aminoacyl and peptidyl tRNAs toward the 5' direction by one base3. The slippery shift site on the messenger RNA has an X XXY YYN consensus sequence (the initial reading frame is indicated, and bases X and Y can be identical). This homopolymeric sequence can maintain at least two out of three base pairs with the anticodons upon slippage3.",

The pseudoknot conformation originates from a hairpin structure, in which a single-stranded region folds back to pair with residues in the hairpin-loop region. The stem at the 5' end is named stem 1, and the 3' stem is stem 2. Loop 1 and loop 2 are unpaired regions that cross the major groove of stem 2 and the minor groove of stem 1, respectively10. Many mutational studies have been performed on frameshifting pseudoknots to correlate structure and function4,5,6,7, and certain mutations at the junction of the two stems or loop regions can have deleterious effects on frameshifting efficiencies11,12. These findings suggest that there are special structural features involving tertiary interactions in a frameshifting pseudoknot that are important for function.",

Those pseudoknots active in ribosomal frameshifting revealed that the two base-paired stems are stacked upon each other14,16,17, and are frequently in a bent conformation14,17. In addition, loop nucleotides may be restrained by base-stacking interactions14. However, the junction of the two stems in frameshifting pseudoknots is not well defined, and very little is known about loop\u2013stem interactions. Here we present a 1.6 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of a 28-nucleotide pseudoknot from beet western yellow virus (BWYV), a plant luteovirus that is active in ribosomal frameshifting and regulates the production of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase8. The structure reveals an RNA triplex formed by loop 2 in the minor groove of stem 1, and quadruple interactions between a loop 1 base and the major groove of stem 2. In addition, there is a marked rotation and bending at the junction of the two stems.",

Continuous stacking of loop 2 onto A25 (magenta) of stem 2 ( Fig. 2d) and the short length of loop 1 induce the rotation of stem 2 in relation to stem 1 (Fig. 2c). There is a 48\u00b0 rotation between the bottom base of stem 2 (A25) and the top base of stem 1 (G7); therefore, they are not stacked (Fig. 2c). The helical axes of the two stems are shifted in relation to one another and displaced by ~5 \u00c5, and the average tilt angle between the two stems is ~25\u00b0. It has been previously suggested that pseudoknots with loop lengths shorter than the minimum length required for crossing the grooves of an A-form helix may impose distortion in the stem regions10. The length of loop 1 is relatively short for stretching across a major groove opening between stem 1 and stem 2 that is enlarged by their relative rotation and bend (Fig. 2ac,d,). This considerable stretch is facilitated by overtwisting the base pairs near loop 1 in both stems.",

This extended RNA triplex, which has six layers of consecutive interactions in the minor groove, has not been previously seen and differs substantially from the nucleic acid triplexes with the third strand in the major groove20,21. The triplex is RNA specific, as every interaction between a loop 2 nucleotide and stem 1 involves a 2'-OH group. The triple-base interactions are not coplanar in many cases. Several interactions involve the N1 and N6 of loop adenines, and N3 and N2 of guanines in the stem. These interactions with the third strand contribute to the large propeller twists in stem 1, and the gradual bend toward the major groove.",

This anchorlike adenosine spans the minor groove and interacts with both strands of stem 1. It is held in this position by an extensive network of seven hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3b), using both base and sugar interactions. The 2'-OH of A20 contributes four of the hydrogen bonds by interacting with two layers of bases (Table 2). Two of the hydrogen bonds are bifurcated, involving O2 atoms of residues C5 and C17, resulting in the tilt of these bases (Fig. 2 c). Some of these adenosine interactions have also been seen in the crystal structures of the hammerhead ribozyme23 and group I intron24. In both cases, the adenosine in an RNA tetraloop contacts the minor-groove side of a G\u2013C base pair to form four of the seven hydrogen bonds observed here. In contrast to A20, the adenines there are not tilted and are largely in the plane of the base pair.",

Rather than pairing with U13 as predicted (Fig. 2b), the A25 adenine forms three hydrogen bonds at the junction through its Watson\u2013Crick face (Fig. 4b). The interactions with the O2 and 2'-OH of C14 are similar to those observed between A23 and C15 (Fig. 3d). On the strand opposite to A25 (Fig. 2a,c), the extruded U13 has a rotated and reversed sugar direction in relation to the adjacent nucleotides. This results in considerable compression of the backbone with a close U13\u2013C14 P\u2013P distance of 4.65 \u00c5, which allows G12 to stack directly upon the base plane and furanose oxygen of C14 (Fig. 2c). Other bulge nucleotide conformations have been observed, although their sugar rotations are less marked28,29,30. In the crystal structure, U13 makes lattice contacts through stacking and base-pairing interactions. Symmetry-related bases that are bulged or unpaired, namely U13, G19 and G1, form a continuous stacking core of six layers. In addition, the U13 nucleotides in this stacking core use their Watson\u2013Crick faces to form Hoogsteen base pairs with symmetry-related adenosine 20.",

In the BWYV pseudoknot, a C8\u2013A9 sequence crosses the major groove, and the C residue is conserved in some luteovirus pseudoknots8. In the BWYV structure, C8 is inserted into the major groove of stem 2, forming a quadruple-base interaction with G12, A25 and C26 (Figs 2a,  4a). This is the first example of one base hydrogen bonding to three other bases, two of which form a base pair. The G12\u2013C26 base pair has a strong propeller twist, which is needed for C26 to stack upon the tilted A25 (Figs 2c,4a). As noted by the asterisk in Fig. 4a, the distance between N3 of C8 and O6 of G12 is 2.82 \u00c5, and it is likely that C8 is protonated in the N3 position to form a hydrogen bond. Protonation of cytosines is also found in other nucleic acid structures31,32,33. Two water molecules stabilize this core interaction by mediating the 2'-OH of C8 to base contacts (A25 and C26) (Fig. 5b). Overall, these major groove interactions and the consecutive minor-groove triplex appear to drive the rotation and bend at the stem 1\u2013stem 2 junction. ",

In the BWYV structure, we have named the loop 1 to stem 2 transition a 'C turn' (Fig. 5a), which has some features in common with the U turn. The 'C turn' involves the change in direction between loop 1 and the top of stem 2, through three nucleotides (C8, A9 and C10), the last C being base paired. The turn is less sharp than the 180\u00b0 U turn, but is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from N4 of C10 to the phosphate oxygen of A9, which is the second phosphate in the 5' direction. In comparison, the U turn uses a uracil N3 hydrogen-bonded to the fourth phosphate group in the 3' direction. In addition, adenine 9 is partially stacked at an angle on cytosine 10, which is associated with a parallel tilting of C10, propeller twisted in relation to its base-paired G28 (Fig. 2c). An organized network of water molecules facilitates the turn by bridging phosphate or base contacts (Fig. 5a). The array of water molecules on the other side of loop 1 stabilizes its conformation in the major groove ( Fig. 5b).",

Pseudoknots are usually in some type of equilibrium between the folded and the unfolded form34, and it is likely that frameshifting occurs when the pseudoknot does not unravel during translocation. Therefore, features that stabilize the compact form of the pseudoknot may be important for function. It is notable in this regard that the BWYV pseudoknot is stabilized by more hydrogen bonds involved in tertiary interactions (26 total, Table 2) than those engaged in Watson\u2013Crick base pairs (24 total). As the pseudoknot barrier induces ribosomal pausing, it is likely that the ribosome contacts both the slippery site and the pseudoknot simultaneously36. Continued activity of the mRNA translocation machinery probably induces deformation of the pseudoknot, transmitting the \"tug\" through stem 1 into loop 1. Understanding how the tertiary stabilized pseudoknot dynamically responds to deformation in this process may shed light on the -1 slippage mechanism.",

C8 seems to play an organizing role in assembling the junction between the stems. The junctional A25 base not only provides a continuous stacking platform into stem 2 but also plays an important role in stabilizing the C8 base-specific quadruple interactions. Probable unpairing of a junctional base pair in frameshifting pseudoknots as observed here with U13 has also been reported in several biochemical11,37 and NMR studies14. The ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of the luteovirus pseudoknot is relatively low compared to those that have different junctional sequences4,5,6. While the stabilization in loop 2 appears to be a general feature utilized by frameshifting pseudoknots, the junctional interactions may be different in high-efficiency frameshifting systems6,11,12. In those systems, the identity of the loop 1 base analogous to C8 is not crucial for frameshifting activity. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that a certain bent conformation induced by an adenosine wedged base between the two stems may also be important for high-level frameshifting17. Recently, a 4.8 \u00c5 crystal structure of a synthetic SELEX pseudoknot complexed with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was analyzed. Although not all of the pseudoknot was observed, the structure showed a pronounced kink between the two stems, thereby optimizing its contacts with subunits of the heterodimer38.",

Moncoeur, E. & Strobel, S.A., pers. comm.). That study suggested that four consecutive base-triples and 2'-OH mediated tertiary interactions form from the P1 helix. In BWYV, 10 of the 16 hydrogen-bonding contacts in the minor groove are mediated by 2'-OH groups. The 2'-OH groups extend from both edges of the minor groove and are involved in every loop 2 nucleotide interaction. Therefore, it is not surprising that the minor groove is narrowed to clamp the third strand into close contact. The loop 2\u2013stem 1 interactions may also be a general feature in other pseudoknots that are not involved in frameshifting39.

            "text": "There is one RNA pseudoknot per asymmetric unit. The single bromine site was located from the 2.1 \u00c5 isomorphous-difference Patterson map of native II and the bromine derivative data. Five Os sites were located in the Os derivative data collected at the absorption edge by difference Fourier techniques, using the bromine phases. These sites were also confirmed in the Os anomalous-difference Patterson maps. We used a combination of multiple isomorphous-replacement and anomalous-scattering (MIRAS) methods for phasing with the program SHARP45. The Residual maps from SHARP revealed other characteristics of the heavy-atom sites, and the space group enantiomorph was determined. The electron density maps were greatly improved through the addition of an alternative position for the major osmium-binding site along with refinement of anisotropic temperature factors for the bromine site and the major osmium site. Using the program O (ref. 46), a poly(rC) model with appropriate sugar puckers was built into the solvent-flattened electron density maps generated from native II and the bromine/osmium derivative data. Using SHARP, an excellent 1.9 \u00c5 electron density map was also generated from native I and the bromine/osmium derivative data, confirming the trace, clarifying the identity of bases and revealing the position of the 5'-end \u03b2-phosphate. Initial refinement cycles were performed with X-PLOR47; early observation of unaccounted density in the MIRAS maps and the later appearance of connected density in the simulated-annealing omit maps suggested two conformations of nucleotide U13 and part of the phosphate backbone of residue C14. The two conformations were included in refinement and relative occupancies calculated (C2'-endo/C3'-endo 60% : 40%). Final rounds of refinement to 1.6 \u00c5 were performed using CNS48, which rapidly decreased both the R-factor and Rfree. Bulk solvent and anisotropic temperature factor corrections were carried out in the final process. Statistics are presented in Table 1. A high-density peak that appeared in the solvent-flattened maps was tentatively identified as a sodium ion, with the coordination distance criteria to water molecules or donors of the RNA as 2.4\u20132.8 \u00c5. The magnesium ion was identified by its strict octahedral coordination with ligand distances between 2.1 and 2.3 \u00c5. Helical parameters for the structure were generated by the program CURVES49.",
