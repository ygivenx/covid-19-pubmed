Limited data suggest that heavy or strenuous exercise has an overall negative effect on the immune system, increasing the risk of infection, while regular mild-moderate exercise can protect against infection and reduce symptoms and the risk of chronic disease.20,44 The relationship between exercise and susceptibility to infection is often compared with a J-shaped curve, where moderate exercise enhances immunity above sedentary levels but prolonged, intense activity impairs immune function.20,23 The immune response to exercise depends on many factors, including duration, intensity, type of exercise, hormone and cytokine concentrations, body temperature changes, hydration, and blood flow.44",

IL-6 also suppresses TNF-alpha, which acts as a potent activator of inflammation.20,52 Since cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are strongly associated with blood markers for inflammation, exercise-induced elevation of IL-6 levels should help mediate anti-inflammatory activity, providing some protective effects against development of these chronic diseases.20,52",

Exogenous pyrogens include bacterial toxins, viral pathogens, bacterial cell wall components, and antigen-antibody complexes.7 The exogenous pyrogens bind to macrophages and induce the release of endogenous pyrogens, including interleukins, interferons, and other cytokines, which then stimulate the production of prostaglandin E2. These molecules bind to the preoptic region of the hypothalamus and increase the body temperature \u201cset point.\u201d4,7 Thermoregulatory control maintains this increased set point temperature until the initiating threat or exogenous stimulus has resolved.54 During a febrile state, the body temperature rarely exceeds 40\u00b0C.7 Fever is a self-limiting process that is kept in check by negative feedback of naturally occurring antipyretic hormones produced by the body, including ADH, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, and corticotrophin-releasing factor.7",
