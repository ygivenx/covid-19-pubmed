Nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens tested negative to a panel of molecular assays for CIRD-associated common and emerging viral agents: canine adenovirus (CAV) types 1 and 2, canine distemper virus, canid herpesvirus 1 (CHV-1), canine respiratory coronavirus, influenza virus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, nonprimate canine hepacivirus, B. bronchiseptica, Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, and Mycoplasma cynos (12). Because the etiology of the outbreak was unknown, the case was considered eligible for metagenomic investigation. ",

We evaluated sequence data using CLC Genomic Workbench (http://www.clcbio.com). NGS revealed the presence of parvovirus-related sequence reads that mapped to human bufaviruses. We mapped a total of 3,530 reads to human bufavirus and assembled them into 3 contigs, 422-, 416-, and 191-nt long. We reconstructed the nearly complete genomic sequence of the new CPV (canine bufavirus [CBuV]), strain ITA/2011/297-15, by combining 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) protocols (14) with minor modifications, using the kit 5\u2032 RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and a primer-walking strategy with specific primers designed to close the gaps among noncontiguous sequences.

Thermal cycling consisted of activation of iTaq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, 42 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, and annealing extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. We evaluated the specificity of the assay with a panel of canine DNA viruses (CPV-1, CPV-2, CHV-1, circovirus, CAV-1, and CAV-2). The qPCR detected >101 DNA copies/10 \u03bcL of standard DNA and 8.78 \u00d7 100 DNA copies/10 \u03bcL of DNA template extracted from clinical samples.

Full-genome sequence alignment showed a high degree of sequence divergence, up to 58% overall nucleotide identity to most parvoviruses but not bufaviruses. CBuV was more closely related to bufaviruses identified in primates (61.6%\u201363.2% nt similarity), pigs (59.6% nt), and bats (58% nt) (16\u201320) and more distantly related to CPV-2 (45% nt) (Technical Appendix Table).

In the NS1 gene, CBuV displayed low nt (24.1%\u201369.4%) and aa (19.3%\u201351.4%) identities compared with other protoparvoviruses. Current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for classification of parvoviruses into the same species require >85% aa identity in the NS1 protein; on this basis, CBuV could be classified as a new parvovirus species. The closest relatives to CBuV were protoparvoviruses identified in primates and other mammals (16\u201319), commonly termed as bufaviruses. Bufaviruses were first identified in 2012 in Burkina Faso in fecal samples from a child with enteric signs (16). Similar bufaviruses have been subsequently identified in different species of domestic and wild animals (18\u201320). CBuV exhibited the most similarity in NS1 (66.9%\u201369.4% nt and 47.2%\u201351.4% aa) and VP1 (66%\u201368.2% nt and 62.5%\u201367.2% aa) to bufaviruses identified in primates. In addition, the genetic organization of CBuV resembled that of primate bufaviruses, with the conservation of a potential splicing mechanism regulating VP1 translation. On the other hand, CBuV was genetically more distantly related to CPV-2, showing only 56% nt and 40.6% aa identity in the NS1 and 42.6% nt and 33.4% aa identity in the VP1 between the 2 canine protoparvoviruses. Because we were not able to adapt the virus to in vitro growth in different canine cell lines, we could not assess whether there is an antigenic relationship between the 2 canine protoparvoviruses, CBuV and CPV-2, in cross-neutralization studies.",

This low level of virus shedding in NOP secretions was difficult to interpret, and intrinsic properties of the virus, or the dynamics of virus shedding at the time of sampling, or both could account for it. For comparison, a human parvovirus associated with respiratory disease, human bocaparvovirus 1, can be shed at titers as high as 3.9 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL in NOP samples (36). It is worth noting that we also found high loads of CBuV (<2.57 \u00d7 1010 DNA copies/10 \u03bcL of template) in 4 fecal samples that substantially exceeded the median value (2.92 \u00d7 102 DNA copies/10 \u03bcL) of collection EHA.",

The prevalence of bufaviruses in human patients ranges from 0.3% to 4%, and their etiologic role in enteric or extraenteric diseases remains uncertain (16,17,37\u201341). Bufaviruses have also been found in other mammalian hosts, including wild and captive nonhuman primates, swine, shrews, rats, bats, and fur seals (18\u201320,42\u201346). Of interest, bufaviruses have also been detected in the serum and spleens of monkeys and in the spleens of shrews (18,44) and in a unique NOP sample of 955 human patients with lower respiratory tract signs (47), suggesting the possibility of extraintestinal or systemic infections. In this study, we have also reconstructed the genome sequence of 2 CBuV strains detected in canine fecal samples. By genome comparison, we observed only 2 aa differences between the CBuV strains of respiratory and enteric origin, although the viruses were identified from animals of different geographic origin (i.e., Italy and Hungary). Although our findings corroborate earlier evidence that bufaviruses can target extraintestinal tissues and organs, only animal experiments or detailed observational studies can fully address this issue.",
