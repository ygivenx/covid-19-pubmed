            "text": "Dengue fever is a systemic viral infection transmitted to humans by various types of mosquito, such as the Aedes aegypti. After infection, the symptoms typically appear after an incubation period of 3 to 7 days (Simmons et al. 2012). In the initial febrile phase, the patients suffer from high temperature (\u226538.5 \u00b0C), headaches, vomiting, myalgia, and joint pain, often accompanied by a transient macular rash. This phase lasts for 3 to 7 days, after which most patients recover without any complications (Simmons et al. 2012). However, in a small number of cases, the condition of the patient deteriorates and dengue hemorrhagic fever could develop. This condition could be fatal without proper medical care. In December 2015, the first dengue vaccine was licensed; however, currently, it is not available widely and treatment therefore remains supportive (Pitisuttithum and Bouckenooghe 2016; World Health Organization 2016).",

The increase in the incidence of dengue fever has been ascribed to the changing human ecology, demography, and globalization, and probably climate change (World Health Organization 2012). For example, for the first time in metropolitan France, two cases of autochthonous dengue fever were diagnosed in September 2010 (La Ruche et al. 2010). Furthermore, after 70 years with no confirmed autochthonous cases of dengue fever in Japan, 19 cases were reported in Tokyo during August and September 2014 (Kutsuna et al. 2015). It has been predicted that climate change would contribute to an expansion at the fringes of the current distribution of dengue fever, with 4.39 billion people being at risk of contracting the disease by 2030 (Hales et al. 2014).",

On average, ambulatory and hospitalized patients lose 6.6 and 9.9 days of work, respectively. Absence from work often results in economic losses (Suaya et al. 2009), and the estimated total annual cost (i.e., direct and indirect medical costs) associated with the disease amounted to US$2.1 billion in the Americas for the period 2000\u20132007 (Shepard et al. 2011). It has been calculated that these costs were mostly related to productivity losses induced by non-fatal dengue fever cases, whereas the deaths resulting from the disease accounted for only a small proportion (2.6%) of the total costs (Shepard et al. 2011). Such productivity losses appeared as stagnation of the production activities and increased production costs.",

(2014) estimated the population at risk of dengue infection in 2030 by taking into account the future climate, population, and the gross domestic product (GDP) of each country and region. The GDP was used to evaluate the vulnerability of each country and region (Hales et al. 2014), with the study utilizing the data from these countries and regions. In the current study, the estimated population at risk of dengue of each country and region in 2030 was divided by the predicted population in 2030 (United Nations 2011) to quantify the population at risk of dengue infection per person. The percentage of the population at risk of dengue infection relevant to climate and socioeconomic changes in 2030 (Table 1) was used as f(Haz, Vul) in Eq. (1). It was predicted that more than 90% of the population in Southeast Asia and Latin America (tropical) would be at risk by 2030. In addition, a relatively high risk was indicated for South Asia, the Caribbean, and Central Sub-Saharan Africa. On the other hand, no risk was indicated for Europe, whereas the high-income countries in Asia Pacific and North America had a small risk.\n",

These exporting countries have a higher percentage of population at risk of contracting dengue fever (Table 1).

The risk in the Asia-Pacific and African countries was significant, with 63% of workers classified as being at risk of contracting dengue fever (Table 2). In view of these findings, it would be advisable for the fish product industry in the USA to promote risk management in their international supply chain.(b)Textiles in China\n",

The plant-based fiber sector accounted for 38% of the effects, namely, 10% in China, 15% in African countries, and 13% in Asia-Pacific countries. The plant-based fiber sector provides the main materials to the textile sector, such as cotton (Gossypium spp) and jute (Corchorus capsularis). The textile sector in China purchases 20,532 m EUR from the chemical sector and 8497 m EUR from the local plant-based fiber sector in China in 2007 (Wood et al. 2015). The purchase amount of the chemical sector exceeded that of the plant-based fiber sector; however, the labor intensity of the chemical sector (14.7 workers/m EUR) was much lower than was that of the plant-based fiber sector (762 workers/m EUR) (Wood et al. 2015), and the plant-based fiber sector was therefore identified as a significant sector. As the textile sector is labor intensive, it is important to strengthen the risk management in this sector. Moreover, the plant-based fiber sector provides materials (e.g., cotton) to the textile sector; consequently, there is a need to reinforce the risk management for dengue fever infection.(c)Food products in China\n",

The situation in 2007 was adopted because of the difficulty of predicting the future economic situation. However, as the textile industry has been relocating to a country where labor cost is lower, the industrial structure and the international supply chain have been changing. Therefore, the future economic situation has to be considered in order to increase the reliability of the study.",

The study clarified the effects of dengue fever infection on various global industries by projections for 2030, taking into account the international supply chain. The results indicated that more than 10% of workers involved in the supply chain of all the major industries in the USA, China, Japan, and Germany would be at risk of contracting dengue fever by 2030, whereas more than 70% of the workers in India and Brazil would be at risk by that time. The effects of dengue fever could influence industrial activities in the regions at risk (e.g., India and Brazil) and in the other regions (e.g., USA, Japan, and Germany) through the supply chain. In particular, industries that are highly labor intensive (agriculture, fishery, and the distribution industry) would be advised to consider adequate adaptation measures. It is recommended that the downstream side of the supply chain, such as industries in the USA, Japan, and Germany, identify processes at risk of infectious disease in the supply chain where worker\u2019s health management systems should be introduced. This study indicated that implementation of such systems would reduce business risks and improve shareholder value (Godfrey et al. 2009); therefore, I recommend that such interventions to upstream side of the supply chain be included in investment criteria. As the study focused only on the effects of dengue fever in 2030, with limited data being available, comprehensive analysis with data modeled for the future could increase the reliability of the results.",
