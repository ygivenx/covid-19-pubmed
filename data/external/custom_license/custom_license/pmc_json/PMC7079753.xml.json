Interferon-\u03b3 secreted by activated T cells and NK cells is intimately involved in the innate and acquired immune responses [1\u20133]. As a major macrophage activation factor, IFN-\u03b3 binds to its receptor on the macrophage cell surface and reprograms gene expression necessary for the execution of host defense functions by modulating signal transduction pathways. IFN-induced proteins include enzymes, transcription factors, cell surface glycoproteins, cytokines, chemokines and a large number of factors with unknown functions [4].",

IP-10/CXCL10 binds its receptor CXCR3 to play a biological role in stimulation of monocytes, natural killer (NK) and T cell migration, regulation of T cell and bone marrow progenitor maturation, modulation of adhesion molecule expansion and inhibition of angiogenesis [6\u201313]. The expression of IP-10/CXCL10 has also been observed in a wide variety of chronic inflammatory disorders and auto immune conditions [14\u201318]. Recently, it is reported that SARS-CoV may instigate an excessive immune response through overproduction of IP-10/CXCL10, MCP-1 and IL-8, resulting in transendothelial infiltration and accumulation of neutrophils, alveolar macrophages and Th1 lymphocytes into lung tissue causing pulmonary inflammation and destruction [19]. Previous studies have shown that IP-10/CXCL10 could be an excellent prognostic marker for SARS disease progression [20, 21]. IP-10/CXCL10 is also induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes for recruiting inflammatory cells into the lobules and acts as an important predictor of chronic HCV infection progression [22]. Thus, IP-10/CXCL10 is considered as a predictive marker of successful treatment response in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients [23]. In addition, Kong et al. [24] have reported that IP-10/CXCL10 levels are increased in SLE, and serum IP-10/CXCL10 may represent a more sensitive marker for monitoring disease activity than standard serological tests.",

The effect of skin color on the percutaneous penetration of PTS2 in men has been described [32]. PTO, a monomer of PTS2 which inhibits the growth of fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, is widely used in cosmetics and shampoo. Recently, we reported that PTS2 induced Hela cells apoptosis through activating MAPKs pathway [33] and inhibited LPS-induced up-regulation of iNOS and COX-2 protein levels and NO production in RAW264.7 cells [34]. Here we show evidence that PTS2 inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced up-regulation of IP-10/CXCL10 in RAW264.7 cells. We also found that IFN-\u03b3-induced increase of IP-10/CXCL10 mRNA level was suppressed significantly by PTS2 treatment. The mechanism utilized by PTS2 to prevent IP-10/CXCL10 expression is related to its inhibitory effects on JAK/STAT1 signal transduction induced by IFN-\u03b3. These results suggest that PTS2 may affect host immune responses by down-regulating IFN-\u03b3-induced gene expression.\n",

The result from ELISA assay showed that IFN-\u03b3 stimulated IP-10/CXCL10 secretion dramatically and PTS2 dose-dependently inhibited the elevation of IP-10/CXCL10 level with significant reductions at doses of 5.0 and 10.0 \u03bcM.

We thus evaluated the effects of PTS2 on IFN-\u03b3-induced JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 activation in RAW264.7 cells. The cells were pretreated with 3.0, 5.0, 10.0 \u03bcM of PTS2 for 2 h or not, and then incubated with IFN-\u03b3 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min. Western blot analysis showed that JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 were markedly activated by IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, whereas PTS2 treatment led to a reduction in IFN-\u03b3-induced JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). Next, RAW264.7 cells were treated with PTS2 (5.0 \u03bcM) for 2 h or not, and then incubated with IFN-\u03b3 (10 ng/ml) for 0\u201360 min. As assessed by Western blotting, IFN-\u03b3 rapidly (within 3 min) increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 1022/1023 of JAK1 and 1007/1008 of JAK2, and tyrosine 701 of STAT1 (Fig. 4b). PTS2 decreased the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4b). When RAW264.7 cells were treated with different concentration of IFN-\u03b3 (1\u201310 ng/ml), a dramatic and concentration-dependent JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 4c). PTS2 significantly attenuated IFN-\u03b3-induced JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4c), whereas the amount of total JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 proteins in RAW264.7 cells were not affected by both IFN-\u03b3 and PTS2 treatment (Fig. 4a\u2013c). Previous reports showed that the selective pharmacological JAK2 inhibitor AG490 could significantly inhibit upregulated chemokine expression induced by IFN-\u03b3 in mouse mesangial cells [29]. Therefore, we compared the effects of PTS2 and AG490 on IFN-\u03b3-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression. RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with PTS2 (5.0 \u03bcM) or AG490 (30.0 \u03bcM) or both of them, respectively, for 2 h, and then incubated with IFN-\u03b3 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. The cell culture supernates were subjected to ELISA analysis to measure IP-10/CXCL10 protein levels. As shown in Fig. 4d, PTS2, at concentration of 5.0 \u03bcM, proved more effective in suppressing IFN-\u03b3-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression than 30.0 \u03bcM of AG490. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression in the cells co-incubated with PTS2 and AG490 together was lower than in those treated with either PTS2 or AG490. Taken together, these results suggested that PTS2 inhibited IFN-\u03b3-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression in RAW 264.7 cells through suppressing activation of JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway.\n",

Sakaeda et al. [41] showed that IFN-\u03b3-stimulated IP-10/CXCL10 expression in RAW264.7 cells. In the current study, we demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3-induced up-regulation of IP-10/CXCL10 in RAW264.7 cells was dose and time-dependently inhibited by PTS2. Although IFN-\u03b3 induces a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 and activation of STAT1 in RAW264.7 cells, when treating cells with IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of PTS2, JAK/STAT1 activation was depressed. Moreover, we found that the inhibitory effect of PTS2 on IP-10/CXCL10 up-regulation was slightly stronger than JAK2 inhibitor AG490 while RAW264.7 cells co-incubated with PTS2 and AG490 showed marked reduction of IP-10/CXCL10, suggesting the synergistic effect of PTS2 and AG490. These results indicate that PTS2 inhibits IFN-\u03b3-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression through preventing activation of the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway. A similar result revealed in our recent report indicates that PTS2 inhibits the LPS-induced iNOS expression by depressing phosphorylation of STAT1 in RAW264.7 cells [34]. It has been demonstrated that activation of p38 appears to play a critical role in regulation of the expression of a number of chemokines and cytokines induced by IFN-\u03b3 in macrophages [31], but in the present study, PTS2 did not alter IFN-\u03b3-induced p38 phosphorylation. Majumder et al. [42] showed that the induction of IP-10/CXCL10 was dependent on the ISRE (interferon-stimulated response element) and one of the two NF-\u03baB recognition sites. We also tried to study the effect of PTS2 on NF-\u03baB signaling, however, we did not find NF-\u03baB activation by IFN-\u03b3 stimulation through detecting ubiquitination of I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03baB\u03b2 in RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). The result is consistent with the results that NF-\u03baB can regulate IP-10/CXCL10 expression but IFN-\u03b3 did not detectably activate NF-\u03baB in both Myd88\n\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type macrophages [43]. In addition, our work also indicates that PTS2 has no significant effect on cell viability (data not shown).",
