They differ in their effectiveness regarding the number and groups of beneficiaries. For example, reducing air pollution leads to a reduction in respiratory diseases, which saves the lives of primarily the youngest and oldest groups of the population, while only working people benefit from reduced work place risks. If budget constraints are relevant, the question emerges how restricted resources should be distributed across the available life-saving measures so that social benefits are maximised.",

The VSL provides a monetary measure of health benefits and represents the ratio at which people are willing to exchange income for risk changes. The VSL is often inferred from information about the individual willingness-to-pay (WTP) to prevent mortality risks. It is an ongoing discussion whether the financing of life-saving measures should be adjusted to individual characteristics (for a comprehensive discussion, see Sunstein 2004). Adjustment according to age has provoked particularly intense debate. Government agencies pursue different approaches regarding the use of such a \u201csenior discount\u201d. For example, while the European Commission DG Environment recommends an adjustment to age (European Commission 2000), an age-dependent VSL is not applied by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Environmental Protection Agency 2003, p. 37). These different governmental approaches may result from ambiguous findings in the literature with respect to age effects on VSL.",

In contrast to previously published preference studies, the relevance of an individuals\u2019 probability of dying for VSL estimates is analysed by using information on a particular risk specification that allows for distinguishing explicitly between two groups exposed to the same risk type. In this paper, mortality risk is defined as the probability of dying in a snow avalanche. While one group (skiers) faces an age-dependent hazard rate, the hazard rate of the others (non-skiers) is rather insensitive to individual characteristics. The paper addresses the question of whether people benefit differently from reduced mortality risks, in particular, whether WTP and VSL is sensitive to age once the individual mortality risk (which can be either sensitive or insensitive to age) is taken into account. Age is considered by calculating the WTP and VSL for particular age classes.",

VSL is discussed in various contexts, such as valuation of reduced health risks (e.g. cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases), work place risks, traffic risks, or risks arising from natural hazards.1 In general, VSL estimates are dependent on whether they are based on one\u2019s overall risk of dying or on a very specific risk of dying, the profile of future income, the remaining life expectancy or the individuals\u2019 baseline risk. Among these determinants, the relevance of age in mortality risk assessment is of ongoing interest and has been discussed and analysed in several studies.\n2 The theoretical literature defines two key components of how age affects the monetary valuation of reduced mortality risks: (1) the individual hazard rate (probability of dying), and (2) the level of optimal consumption.",

In their simulations, the authors demonstrate that the profile of WTP with respect to age depends on the existence of markets for borrowing and annuities, as such markets influence the individuals\u2019 income over time and, hence, the individual consumption path. If no markets exist, the WTP for risk reductions follows an inverted-U shape, with lower values for the youngest and oldest individuals in the population and a peak of payments at the age of 40. However, this shape is dampened considerably when perfect markets for borrowing and annuities are available. A further theoretical discussion of age effects on VSL is provided in Johansson (2002) or Alberini et al. (2004). These authors also analyse the role of individual hazard rates and the utility of income and argue that theory does not support a general decline of VSL with age. They conclude that, depending on the age sensitivity of the hazard rate and the utility of income, the VSL can either remain age-independent, increase, or decrease with increasing age.",

(2004) estimate the VSL for older workers by observing their behaviour (wage-risk trade-offs) on the labour market. Their findings show an increase of compensation requirements with increasing age, which is mirrored in higher VSL figures for older employees. Viscusi and Aldy (2007) examine how VSLs vary with age across the working population considering age-specific fatality risks. Their VSL estimates for different age classes project an inverted U-shape, indicating that VSL figures first rise and then fall with age. A considerable decrease of VSL with age is found in Alberini et al. (2005), in which the authors estimate the WTP for reduced cardiovascular and respiratory risks. According to their results, people in their 70s state values that are about three-quarters lower than the statements of 30-year-old respondents. Alberini et al. (2004) examine the influence of age and health risks on VSL using data from two contingent valuation studies conducted in Canada and the US. They analyse the individuals\u2019 WTP for a reduction in their overall mortality risk\u2014without pointing at a specific risk\u2014and find weak (no) evidence for decreasing VSL with increasing age in the Canadian (US) sample. Liu et al. (2005) refer to mortality risks due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and do not find any influence of age on WTP to eliminate the chance of becoming infected.",

Risk prevention was assumed to come from passive control measures against avalanches, i.e. fatal avalanche accidents could be reduced by means of constructions such as tunnels or barriers. In the underlying study it was assumed that an increase in risk is avoidable by means of maintenance of pre-existing risk reduction programmes. The reduction in question was described as follows (divergence in wording for the larger risk variation in parentheses):Several risk reduction programmes against avalanches on roads and in residential areas have been implemented in Tyrol. At present, on average 2.35 people out of 100,000 inhabitants are killed by avalanches annually. Assume that all public funds for maintaining these measures will be cut, and so servicing costs henceforth have to be paid exclusively out of private funds. If aggregate private contributions are too small, maintenance is not carried out, and the probability of a fatal avalanche doubles (quadruples). Then, on average, 4.7 (9.4) people out of 100,000 inhabitants die in avalanche-related accidents (see Fig. 1).

Solving the maximisation problem results in the maximal ERPVU at age \u03c4, denoted by V\n\u03c4(\u03c4), conditional on having survived until age \u03c4 (for details, see Johansson 2001):\n1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ V_{\\tau}(\\tau)=\\int\\limits^{\\infty}_{\\tau}{u\\left[c^{*}(t)\\right]}e^{-\\theta(t-\\tau)}\\mu(t;\\tau){\\rm d}t $$\\end{document}\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$u\\left[c^{*}(t)\\right]$$\\end{document} denotes the utility derived from the optimal consumption level at age t,  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$c^{*}(t),$$\\end{document} with t \u2265 \u03c4,  \u03b8 represents the marginal rate of time preference and is assumed to be a constant, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mu(t;\\tau)={\\frac{\\mu(t)} {\\mu(\\tau)}}$$\\end{document} stands for the survival function conditional on attaining age \u03c4 with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mu(t)=e^{-\\int_0^t\\gamma(s)ds}$$\\end{document} and the hazard function \u03b3(s).12 Consider a decrease in the hazard rate and the associated change in the ERPVU:2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ dV_{\\tau}(\\tau)=\\int\\limits^{\\infty}_{\\tau+T}{u\\left[c^{*}(t)\\right]}e^{-\\theta(t-\\tau)}d\\mu(t;\\tau) $$\\end{document}with \u03c4 + T referring to the point in time when the risk reduction starts and d\u03bc(t;\u03c4) representing the time change in the survival function resulting from the change in the hazard rate.

For non skiers, the VSL should even be quite constant over age as their hazard rate is age-independent (see the theoretical analysis above).",

Comparing the Turnbull WTP among age classes for the group of skiers, one finds that the WTP for people aged 25\u201334 and 63+ is significantly lower than WTP for the youngest. Further significant differences are observable between other age classes as well. The depreciation is strongest, and always highly significant, for the oldest.

There are only three pairs of age classes where WTP differs significantly from each other.\n29 But WTP for non-skiers aged 63 and older does not show a statistically significant deviation from the mean values in the other age classes.

The results in this paper indicate that the age pattern of individual hazards rates is a decisive determinant in explaining age variations in VSL figures and, hence, in justifying an adjustment of those measures to age. If protection measures that aim at protecting a wide population whose mortality risks do not depend on individual characteristics such as age are at stake (i.e. risk exposure is the same for all beneficiaries), an adjustment of the resulting benefits to age is not justified. In this setting, non-skiers belong to this group as they reveal similar WTP across all ages. A \u201csenior discount\u201d as sometimes proposed would contradict the individual statements. In the context of preventing fatal avalanche accidents, an age adjustment in VSL measures is appropriate solely for skiers. In this case, policies that simply use an overall value but do not control for such variation ignore the diversity in benefits and, hence, lead to an insufficient provision of (environmental) risk-reducing measures.",
