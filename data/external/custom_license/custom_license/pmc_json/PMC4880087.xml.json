Both persons had low antibody titers, and neither reported any recent clinical symptoms, indicating that their MERS-CoV infections probably occurred well before the time of sampling and that the infections may have been mild or subclinical. Because data about persistence of MERS-CoV antibodies after asymptomatic infection are not available, it can only be speculated when and where these infections were acquired. Neither the 2 MERS-CoV antibody\u2013positive persons nor most of the other tested persons owned dromedaries.

            "text": "The absence of autochthonous human MERS-CoV infections in Africa has triggered hypotheses regarding differences in disease transmission between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and has raised doubts regarding the role of camels as a source of infection. Our study provides evidence for unrecorded human MERS-CoV infections in Kenya. The proportion of seropositive specimens that we found is comparable to previously reported proportions of unrecorded infections in the general population in Saudia Arabia (1.52% vs. 1.43% positivity by rELISA and 0.15% vs. 0.18% positivity by PRNT for Kenya vs. Saudi Arabia, respectively) (6). Because of an apparently low infection rate and a bias toward reporting severe cases, the discovery of unreported MERS cases requires testing of large sample sizes with well-validated serologic methods (6). Although the number of samples we tested was approximately only one tenth of the number of samples tested during the Saudi Arabia study, the proportion of seropositive specimens may be similar in Kenya and Saudi Arabia. The lack of a well-developed public health system in parts of Africa could lead to underdiagnosis of clinical cases and would therefore prevent case notification. Moreover, less accessible hospital care might preclude large nosocomial outbreaks as have been observed in countries on the Arabian Peninsula and in South Korea. Other possible explanations for the absence of confirmed and reported clinical cases of MERS-CoV infection in Africa include lesser virulence of strains from Africa and cultural differences that might cause persons of different age ranges to be exposed to the virus.",
