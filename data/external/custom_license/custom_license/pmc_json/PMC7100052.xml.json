            "text": "Respiratory infections occur at a higher frequency in early life than in adulthood [1], with children experiencing approximately five to six infections per year [2, 3]. Influenza activity in Germany has a strong and clear seasonality, with peak epidemic periods occurring during the winter [4].The pandemic novel swine-origin influenza type A virus A(H1N1)pdm09 has disseminated globally after initially being identified in Mexico and the USA in April 2009. This virus appeared in Germany at the end of April 2009 and continued to spread throughout the summer, with a first wave of influenza emerging around July and August 2009, although at low activity. These cases were predominantly infections introduced by travelers returning from countries with a notable prevalence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infections. A few weeks later an increase in the number of indigenous cases was also observed in Germany [5]. At the end of 2009, around week 40, a second increase in epidemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus activity was noted which reached its peak in week 47, as described previously [6]. This activity of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus occurred more than 3 months earlier than that normally observed for the seasonal influenza epidemics during past years that typically start around December/January. Altogether, from April 2009 to April 2010, 226,140 confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases were reported to the Robert-Koch-Institute, of which 253 were fatal. Peak activity occurred in November 2009 [6, 7], and by December 2009 the number of new infections had distinctly decreased, possibly due to the vaccination of risk groups with the pandemic vaccine. A second, possibly contributing factor to this decrease in infections may have been the growing awareness of the general population and, accordingly, a more pronounced adherence to personal hygiene, leading to containment of future infections [6].",

However, it started with a delay of several weeks, although the intensity did correspond to our expectations (Figs. 1, 3). A possible explanation for the delay might be that the hMPV and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were competing for the human host and that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was disseminating faster in the population, thereby causing a greater number of infections and thus suppressing the hMPV epidemic for several weeks. In addition, a more pronounced compliance by the general population with personal hygiene measures may have played a role in the containment of hMPV but not in the containment of the more rapidly propagating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. However, the fact that the endemic rhinoviruses were not suppressed by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus favors the hypothesis of the hMPV and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus having a more specific impact.\n",

            "text": "An epidemic of yearly seasonal influenza (A or B) was expected to start in January 2010, similar to almost every other year. However, only sporadic cases were observed, and no epidemic occurred in the season 2009/2010 (Fig. 3). This is in agreement with the data of the influenza sentinel system at the Robert-Koch-Institute, Germany [7]. To which extent a complete suppression by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had taken place or whether a cross-immunity had built up in the general population which might have been effective against seasonal influenza can only be determined by complex and extensive serological tests which are not feasible. In parallel, the same phenomenon was observed during the season of 2010/2011, when no seasonal influenza A was detected. An influenza B epidemic was detected from January 2011 to March 2011 (Fig. 3).",

In particular, we detected co-infections with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and enteroviruses or rhinoviruses. This might be due to the fact that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic occurred during the autumn, when the incidence of picornaviruses is at its highest.",

In addition, peak RSV and hMPV activity occurred later in the 2009/2010 winter season, when compared to their seasonal distributions over the past decade, suggesting that the 2009 H1N1 virus may have influenced the epidemiology of these important respiratory viruses. Available data on the innate immune system response to hMPV infections suggest that differences may exist between hMPV and RSV and that hMPV may induce a distinct host response, possibly characterized by potent innate responses to infection [16].",

Thus, a refractory period develops during influenza infection which protects the cells of the respiratory tract from becoming infected by other respiratory viruses [17]. Respiratory viruses do not bind to the same receptors in the cells of the respiratory system, i.e., human rhinoviruses bind the human intercellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I), whereas influenza viruses bind sialic acid alpha 2\u20136 [18, 19]. The duration of the refractory period has still to be determined but may persist during virus shedding, i.e., for some weeks [20]. These observations are important because viral interference has an impact on the prediction models for influenza virus dissemination. Such models are an outstanding feature of the rational adoption of resolutions in disease control.",

In the short term, however, the real situation is different. In the UK, for example, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 caused more hospital admissions, more critical care admissions, and more deaths in its second year of circulation than in the pandemic year itself due to a variety of reasons, such as a low level of public interest and a lower usage of antiviral drugs [24]. In Spain, significant epidemiological changes and an increased severity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pneumonia were found in the first post-pandemic influenza season [25]. Although the situation in Spain appears to be an exception in comparison to other countries, it helps researchers understand the level of influence the response of local governments has on the spread of a viral infection.",
