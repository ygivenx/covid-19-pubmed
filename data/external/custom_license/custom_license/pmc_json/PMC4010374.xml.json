In mice immunized with vAc-HA, more splenocytes secreted IL-4 and IL-6 than IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, and the level of IL-4 in the culture medium was higher than the level of IFN-\u03b3. These results suggest that vAc-HA induced a Th2-biased immune response in mice, which is consistent with the behavior of vAc-HA as a particle protein vaccine. Our results were also similar to those of previous studies using baculovirus as a vaccine vector and the surface-display approach8.",

Although the transduction efficiency in vivo was difficult to evaluate, the pattern of immune responses elicited by the vAc-HA-DUAL vector, as compared with that elicited by vAc-HA, indicated that the HA protein was likely to have been produced in vivo. Unlike vAc-HA, more splenocytes from immunized mice produced IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 than the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, and the level of IFN-\u03b3 was higher than that of IL-4 in the culture medium, suggesting a Th1-biased immune response. In addition, vAc-HA-DUAL was also found to be more effective in inducing HA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in vitro (data not shown).",

In addition to its high biosafety, easy handling, efficient protein production in insect cells and other advantages, baculovirus vaccine vectors have low pre-existing immunity in humans and animals and the ability to elicit innate immunity. AcMNPV was found to have strong adjuvant properties. It could also activate dendritic cell (DC)-mediated innate immunity through MyD88/TLR9-dependent and MyD88/TLR9-independent pathways, which might help to improve the efficacy of baculovirus vector vaccines24. In fact, AcMNPV was shown to induce antiviral activity in mammalian cells and confer protection against lethal encephalomyocarditis virus and influenza virus infections in mice25, 26.",

            "text": "Several recent studies have shown that baculovirus transduction vectors tend to elicit a Th1-biased immune reaction against the target antigen when the antigen was only expressed in the transduced cells and was not presented on the virions. Evidence has shown that a baculovirus vector with a mammalian expression cassette producing proteins from a SARS-like coronavirus could elicit a Th1-dominant immune response in mice6, 13, 14, 15, 16. A similar approach has been used to develop vaccines against pseudorabies virus. High proportions of Ig2a IgG and high levels of IFN-\u03b3 were found, indicating a Th1-type immune response. Studies using baculovirus capable of displaying circumsporozoite proteins from plasmodium on the virion surface and expressing the same protein in transduced mammalian cells demonstrated that the baculovirus induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response, resulting in strong protection against infection27, 28. By comparing a baculovirus vector that could only display HA with a vector that could both display and express HA, we showed that different biases in Th1 and Th2 immune responses were induced. The balance between Th1 and Th2 responses mounted against an infectious agent can influence both the control of the pathogen and immunopathology. Humoral immune responses are essential for immunity against viral infections, but they may not be sufficient to clear the virus6. T cell responses, especially Th1-mediated cellular immunity, may also play a crucial role in long-term protection in some cases. Thus, the information provided here might be helpful for the design of effective baculovirus-based vaccines in the future.",
