Reverse complements of the 3\u2032 mapping sequences were prepared, resulting in a set of 60 primers for the 15 amplicons (4 primers/amplicon). Three additional primers were added for the extreme termini of the genome. The algorithm also prepared a virtual PCR map of the predicted binding and amplicon size for the primer set on CoV genomes. A map of the primer mapping positions and the predicted PCR products using EMC/2012 as the target is shown in Figure 1, panel A.

In particular, bats, which maintain the largest diversity of CoVs (28), are thought to be a natural reservoir of the virus and thus a probable origin of the novel human betaCoV studied here. Indeed, the initial genetic study of the novel human betaCoV demonstrated its phylogenetic relatedness to the HKU5 and HKU4 bat CoVs in southern China (5). van Boheemen et al. found a bat CoV sequence from the Netherlands that clusters closely with EMC/2012 (3). In addition, most bat CoVs in the group 2c lineage, including the sequence from the Netherlands, were isolated from bat species of the Vespertilionidae family, whereas the SARS-like CoVs in group 2b lineage were mainly from bats from the Rhinolophidae family (29). In this study, we showed that 2 other CoVs from bats from Spain of Vespertilionidae again are also clustered near the novel human betaCoVs (Figure 3, panel G, Appendix), which further supports a European Vespertilionidae bat ancestry for this virus. However, such a genealogic link may be indirect and distant because a similar hypothesis for SARS-CoV has been under dispute: whether the CoV jumped from bats directly to humans or through civets or even through some other animals as intermediate hosts (30). Therefore, like SARS-CoV, the high dissimilarity between the bat CoVs and novel human betaCoVs makes it difficult to rule out the presence of other intermediate hosts transferring the virus from bats to humans and to confirm the geographic origin of the direct predecessor. With the current data, Europe and the Middle East would be plausible regions for more intensive pilot surveillance studies on bats and other animal reservoirs for this virus.",

The large genetic diversity of CoV maintained in animal reservoirs suggests that viruses that independently moved to humans from animals at different times and places are likely to be reasonably dissimilar in their genomes, possibly making the multiple transmission events model less likely. Further information is needed to confirm this point because the currently available data are limited. If we calibrate our molecular clock analysis using the evolutionary rate of Zhao et al. (20) estimated for SARS-CoV, we dated the tMRCA of EMC/2012 and England/Qatar/2012 viruses to early 2011. Therefore, if both sequenced viruses and the other cases descended from a single zoonotic event, then this tMRCA suggests that the novel virus has been circulating in human population for >1 year without detection and would suggest most infections were mild or asymptomatic. The rate would have to be considerably faster, of a magnitude observed for human influenza A virus, for the tMRCA to be compatible with the earliest known cases in April 2012. Perhaps more probable, therefore, is that the 13 known cases of this disease represent >1 independent zoonotic transmission from an unknown source. Viral sequence data from other patients infected with this novel human betaCoV will help to more accurately estimate the estimate a genomic evolutionary rate specific to this virus, which will then yield a tMRCA estimate closer to the actual time.",

A detailed analysis of EMC/2012 receptor use in cell culture (31) revealed that EMC/2012 was capable of infecting a range of mammalian cells, including human, pig, and bat cells, and the virus entry was independent of the ACE2 receptor. Comparing the S genes of England/Qatar/2012 predicts only 2 aa changes (in a 1,367-residue protein). Thus, this broad infection capability of EMC/2012 is likely to be valid for England/Qatar/2012 and would imply a higher possibility for the existence of other intermediate hosts transferring the virus from bats to humans.",
