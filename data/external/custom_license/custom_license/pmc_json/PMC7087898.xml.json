            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality in preschool children and major cause of hospital admissions in young children in the developed world. They also represent a substantial burden on health services [1, 2]. LRTIs can be clinically broadly divided into tracheitis, pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. However, the clinical pictures overlap. Furthermore, some upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) provoke wheezing in susceptible children even without lower airway infection, which brings additional complexity [3]. In small children LRTIs generally have viral etiology [4]. The most common cause of LRTI is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); other possible viral pathogens are human rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and human bocavirus. Viral LRTI cannot be reliably distinguished from an infection with Mycoplasma pneumonia [5, 6].",

            "text": "Viruses also account for the largest proportion of childhood pneumonia [7]. RSV is believed to be the most important viral pathogen causing pneumonia in young children [8, 9]. Other common causes of viral pneumonia in children are adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus. The current epidemiological situation, patient\u2019s age, clinical symptoms, radiographic and laboratory data, and response to treatment can help to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia. However, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly between the different causes of childhood pneumonia [4]. Although chest radiographs and laboratory studies cannot reliably distinguish between different viral pathogens and even not between viral and bacterial etiology, they may be necessary to assess the severity of illness, evaluate potential complications, or to exclude other conditions in the differential diagnosis [10, 11]. Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests that establish the cause of LRTIs in children have the potential to reduce the use of antibiotics, to improve their targeted use and help to control the nosocomial transmission [3].",

With the advance and availability of accurate respiratory pathogen detection, it becomes possible to characterize the clinical pictures of individual respiratory pathogens and to delineate the differences in clinical and laboratory features between them. The aim of our study was to find possible associations of particular viral LRTI with clinical signs and basic laboratory results. These findings could lead to more accurate clinical judgment in primary health care and other conditions of limited diagnostics. Our hypothesis was that particular respiratory viruses cause different clinical pictures and/or basic laboratory results.",

The sampling method is noninvasive and user-friendly and allows sampling without causing major discomfort. Collected swabs were stored in 2 ml of 0.9 % sterile salt solution and kept at 4 \u2103  until processed or for maximum of 3 days. Microbiological testing was performed at the National Laboratory for Health, Environment and Food, Maribor. In order to encompass the majority of described respiratory pathogens in sample material, multiplex PCR assay was used [12]. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) is FDA approved and CE-IVD certified. It detects influenza A virus (subtype H1, H1N1 and H3), influenza B virus, RSV, metapneumovirus, coronaviruses (subtypes NL63, OC43, 229E and HKU1), adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (serotype 1\u20134), bocavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The assay also includes internal controls for amplification and extraction. In this study we used FilmArray RP IVD v1.6 pouches. The sample was added to the pouch in microbiological safety cabinet class II according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In short, the FilmArray pouch stores all of the necessary reagents for sample preparation, RT\u2013PCR, and detection in a freeze\u2013dried format. Approximately 1 ml of hydration solution and 300 \u03bcl of 1:1.5 diluted sample in buffer was injected into the pouch.",

When testing only for association of monoinfections with clinical and laboratory characteristics, we also omitted data for coronavirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus infections, which occurred mostly as coinfections and caused less than five monoinfections cases. Chi-square test was used to test the significance of correlation between the causal agent and clinical data which are categorical variables and one-way ANOVA was used for continuous variables. We upgraded the statistical analysis with multiple logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex, which was used to test the significance of association between a particular virus and those clinical data which are categorical variables and generalized linear model was used for the same purpose for continuous variables.

Human coronaviruses have been known to induce upper respiratory tract symptoms such as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea and their pathogenicity in healthy infants and children was considered to be low. Coronaviruses are often found even in asymptomatic children [13]. On the other hand, coronavirus infections have been detected in variable proportions (2\u20138 %) of neonates, infants, and young children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [14]. In our study coronaviruses were mainly found as a coinfection, as already reported previously [15]. However, association with pneumonia and need for supplemental oxygen, both indicate high pathogenicity of the virus, which was recently reported also by Lee et al. [16]. Rhinoviruses may cause pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, elderly persons, and children with cystic fibrosis; however, their true impact is questionable because they may be an inciting event for other infectious processes and are often detected even in asymptomatic children [17]. Rhinoviruses can also cause severe LRTIs in preterm infants and even in otherwise healthy children [18, 19]. Garcia-Garcia et al. [20] even found rhinovirus as a most common cause of viral pneumonia in otherwise healthy school children. Our results support the important role of human rhinoviruses in children, hospitalized because of the LRTI symptoms; however, they were not found to be a common cause of pneumonia. Shorter length of hospitalization and significant absence of fever in our patients with rhinovirus infections probably also reflect a less severe direct injury of the lower airways and/or prevailing mechanism of asthma exacerbation in rhinovirus infections, which is more amenable to treatment compared to direct LRT injury, typical for other viruses.",

Low prevalence of adenoviral pneumonia could be partially explained by lower sensitivity of FilmArray Respiratory Panel for the detection of several human adenovirus serotypes. However, only one out of missed serotypes is a frequent causative agent of respiratory disease [25], and pneumonia was detected in a small proportion of all adenovirus infections in our study. Shorter length of hospitalization with adenovirus probably also reflects milder forms of inflammation of lower airways, compared to other viruses.

Slightly higher frequencies of adenovirus and influenza viruses in those studies probably reflect the inclusion of patients with URTI. Our study lasted a few months less than 2 years and certain fall and winter months were represented only once, which could distort the epidemiological data. As we included only the patients with LRTI who needed hospitalization, our results do not necessary reflect the whole spectrum of clinical and laboratory characteristics of studied viruses and certain viruses may have different prevalence in outpatient setting as recently reported by Hara et al. [39], who found higher prevalence of adenovirus (30.2 %) and metapneumovirus (16.1 %) in Japanese pediatric outpatients [38].",

Better characterization of different viral infections could diminish the rate of hospitalization and the use of antibiotics.",
