We defined exportation as the arrival of a person infected with MERS-CoV in\na country other than KSA, Jordan, Qatar, and UAE as a result of MERS-CoV infection in\nthose source countries and subsequent outbound travel (not including medical\nevacuation). Because it is unclear whether MERS-CoV cases in Middle Eastern countries\nother than the source countries resulted from importation or a local outbreak, those\ncountries were excluded from the analysis. Exportations can occur by visitors returning\nto their home countries or source country residents traveling abroad. We produced\nexample calculations for destination countries outside the Middle East where exportation\nof MERS-CoV infection cases has been confirmed (Algeria, Austria, France, Greece, Italy,\nMalaysia, Netherlands, Tunisia, United Kingdom, and the United States) as of January 16,\n2015 (Table 1).",

This model also complements previous work\non the risk for MERS-CoV exportation by global air travel, which attempted to quantify\ntravel volume to the affected areas and calculate exportations among Hajj pilgrims in\nKSA (12,13). In our calculations, however, the visitor data\nincluded persons traveling by air, land, and sea and distinguished between visitors to\nthe Middle East and persons from the Middle East traveling abroad over the period of 1\nyear. Unlike Khan et al. (12),\nwe accounted for the rate of infection in the source countries by calculating source\ncountry\u2013specific MERS-CoV incidence rates. Furthermore, by accounting for the\ndifferent travel volume of visitors to the Middle East compared with Middle East\nresidents traveling to non\u2013Middle Eastern countries, we suggested the mode of\nexportation (visitor to the Middle East vs. Middle East resident visiting abroad). For\nMalaysia, estimated expected exportations were higher among visitors to source countries\nthan among source country residents visiting abroad, consistent with the number of\nexportations detected by surveillance. However, the opposite was true for the United\nStates, where 2 source country residents were found to have MERS-CoV infection during\ntheir US visit (7).",

The estimates are based on historical incidence data.\nThus, they are especially applicable for periods in which the incidence of the disease\nremains stable. For outbreaks characterized by a highly transmissible pathogen, the\nmodel might severely underestimate exportations if incidence rates are not projected to\nthe period for which exportations are calculated. In addition, our small multiplier only\ntook into account exportations of symptomatic cases. Given that most of the detected\nexportations resulted in hospitalization of the infected case-patient, the number of\nexportations calculated here likely refers to exportations of severe symptomatic cases.\nRecent results from a serologic survey performed during December 2012\u2013December\n2013 indicate that there might be as many as 44,951 (95% CI 26,971\u201371,922)\npersons infected with MERS-CoV in KSA (14). During that period, there were 125 reported\nconfirmed cases; thus, the ratio of asymptomatic to reported cases might be much higher,\npossibly in the hundreds.
