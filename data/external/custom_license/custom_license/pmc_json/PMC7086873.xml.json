            "text": "It is well known that the genetic code is composed of 61 codons to represent the 20 standard amino acids, and three codons to represent termination signals (UAA, UAG, UGA). Alternative codons encoding the same amino acid are termed \u201csynonymous codons\u201d. In general, each amino acid can be encoded by one (Met, Tyr) or more (up to six) synonymous codons. Previous studies have indicated that synonymous codons are not favored equally within a genome, and members of some species and some genes preferentially use one or several particular synonymous codons. The higher frequency of these preferred codons is called \u201ccodon bias\u201d. Genes from different species or the same species have their own bias of synonymous codon usage [1, 2]. However, mutations resulting in synonymous codons tend to occur in the third base position, and the codons can be interchanged without altering the primary sequence of the protein product. Generally, compositional constraints under mutational pressure and translation selection in nature have been found to be the two main factors accounting for codon usage variation among genes [3\u20135]. In some genes with extremely high A + T or G + C content [3, 6\u20138], mutation pressure plays an important role in affecting the synonymous codon usage pattern. In addition, synonymous codon usage bias is also related with to the processes of DNA replication and transcription [9], gene structure, protein secondary structures [10\u201312] and environmental conditions [13].",

TTV was first detected in a human patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology in 1997 [17] and was then later detected in many other vertebrate animals and domesticated farm animals, such as chickens, pigs, cows and sheep [18\u201321]. In swine, two genetically distinct viruses, torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), have been found [22, 23]. Sequence analysis has shown that the TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomes are only 44 % homologous [23]. Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) are widely distributed and have been detected in serum, plasma, semen, colostrum, feces and tissues of swine [24\u201327]. Because a definitive pathogenic role of this virus has not been demonstrated, it is considered a non-virulent commensal inhabitant of vertebrates. Although TTSuV infection in swine has not directly lead to any diseases and is considered non-pathogenic, the virus still plays an important role in co-infection. It is considered to be a symbiotic virus in vertebrates, and it is associated with economically important diseases.",

The TTSuVs genome approximately 2.8 kb in length, including a coding region translated from the negative-sense ssDNA and a short stretch of untranslated region (UTR) with a high GC content [16, 28]. In the coding region, three open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 (also known as ORF1/1 and ORF2/2), have been found, and the three ORFs have many overlapping genes. Previous studies have confirmed that the Rep protein is encoded by the largest open reading frame (ORF1), which encodes mostly highly hydrophilic viral capsid proteins. The functions of ORF2 and ORF3 and their encoded proteins are unknown. Although many genomic analyses have been performed on TTSuVs in recent years, in-depth studies on codon usage patterns and the factors influencing them are lacking. The codon usage pattern may be important for revealing the molecular mechanism and evolutionary process of TTSuVs. In this study, the key genetic determinants of codon usage in TTSuV1 are examined based on the TTSuV1 coding region sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic study to analyze the synonymous codon usage pattern as well as the main factors affecting codon usage in TTSuV1.",

If the ENC value is closer to 20, the codon usage bias is stronger, and the degree to which codons are used non-randomly is higher. It is generally accepted that genes have a significant codon bias when the ENC value is less than or equal to 35. Thus, the ENC value provides an intuitively meaningful estimate of the codon preference in a gene.

The results could be applied for finding out the major factors affecting codon usage bias. We set up a two-dimensional coordinate system made up of the first principal component (f\n1\u2019) and second principal component (f\n2\u2019). Major trends within this dataset could be determined using measurements of relative inertia, and genes were ordered according to their positions along the axis of major inertia. This method has been used successfully to investigate the variation of RSCU values among all strains [34\u201336].",

The GC3 % was also lower and stable, ranging from 47.5 % to 52.4 %, with an average value of 49.6 %. The average value of GC3 % was similar to that of GC %, indicating that GC3 % was mainly affected by GC %. Hence, the fact that the GC content was lower in TTSuV1 coding sequences and that the codons ending in C were used in a biased way suggested that the content of G or C at the third position of the codon had an effect on the synonymous codons usage pattern. Apart from this, we can also see in Table 2 that the ENC values of the TTSuV1 coding sequences had less fluctuation, ranging from 54.45 to 58.74, with an average value of 56.46, which indicates that the codon bias of the TTSuV1 genome is stable. In general, the lower ENC value indicates a higher codon usage preference and a higher gene expression level as well.

The four strains isolated from Spain were equally spread over both sides of the first axis and partially overlapped with each other.

TTSuVs is an emerging zoonotic DNA virus that has seriously threatened the development of the pig-raising industry and has brought about great economic losses worldwide. The virus is commonly present in the host\u2019s serum, plasma, semen, milk, feces and other tissues [23\u201326, 38\u201341]. Although TTSuVs infection occurs in all ages, genders, and varieties of pigs [39, 41\u201344], a definitive pathogenic role of the virus has not been demonstrated. A recent study has shown that TTSuVs is associated with many economically important diseases, such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [45]. Krakowka et al. found that TTSuV1 promoted both porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection in gnotobiotic piglets. In addition, TTSuV1 co-infection with PRRSV has been correlated with the development of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PNDS) in gnotobiotic piglets [46].",

Because C %, U %, C3 % and U3 % play an important role in the formation of the different optimal codons ending with any nucleotide, the codon usage pattern of the TTSuV1 coding region is likely to be influenced by composition constraints. Using nucleotide content and RSCU value analysis, we found that the TTSuV1 coding region was GC3 poor (average value, 49.6 %), and most of the preferentially used codons were A-ended or C-ended codons, and G-ended or U-ended codons were of lower preference. Previous studies have shown that many viruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus, influenza A virus subtype H5N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human bocavirus, preferentially use C-ended or G-ended codons [8, 47, 48]. The overall nucleotide content has an effect on the nucleotide content at the third codon position in TTSuV1, and the over-represented synonymous codons depending on the RSCU value matched with the results deduced from nucleotide content. This evidence indicates that the overall composition constraints affect the nucleotide content at the third codon position and the codon usage pattern of TTSuV1; that is to say, mutation pressure plays an important role in influencing the TTSuV1 codon usage pattern.",

As a case in point, the ENC values varied from 54.45 to 58.74, with a stable diversification. The average ENC value of 56.46 among TTSuV1 coding genes can be compared to those calculated for other viruses, such as H5N1 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, porcine adenovirus and nucleopolyhedroviruses, for which mean values of 50.91, 48.99, 38.97 and 38.80, respectively, have been reported [13, 48\u201350]. Therefore, taken together with published data on codon usage bias in other viruses, we conclude that the codon usage bias in TTSuV1 gene is lower and might be affected by natural selection. The low codon bias of TTSuV1 might result from an increase its own replication efficiency in order to adapt to the replication system of its hosts.",

            "text": "It is well established that synonymous codon usage in various organisms often reflects a balance between mutation pressure and natural selection. As for some RNA viruses, previous studies have reported that the major factor in shaping the codon usage pattern appears to be mutation pressure rather than natural selection [51]. Shacklton et al. revealed that codon usage bias was strongly correlated with the overall genomic GC content in DNA virus, suggesting that genome-wide mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main determinant of codon usage bias [35]. However, Naya et al. found that there was no evidence indicating that the genome composition shaped the codon usage bias in high-GC-content genes [52]. In this study, except for mutation pressure, natural selection also played an important role in determining the codon usage bias of TTSuV1, which was supported by the non-correlation (p > 0.05) between GC1 %, GC2 % with GC3 %, and the results deduced from the ENC plot, in which almost all genes were below the expected curve. In addition, according to the analysis of the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolates from different countries, we found that geographic factors were related to codon usage patterns in TTSuV1. It is interesting to note that TTSuV1 isolates from different countries, and even from the same country, had significant differences in their genetic characteristics. This might suggest that natural selection is a factor that shapes the overall codon usage pattern of this virus and acts as a major force to drive TTSuV1 evolution.",

As for TTSuV1, the results suggest that there has been an interaction of mutation pressure with natural selection in the process of TTSuV1 evolution, although ENC values for the whole TTSuV1 coding region indicate that mutation pressure is one of the factors influencing the codon usage pattern. If synonymous codon usage bias is affected only by mutation pressure, then the frequency of nucleotides A and T should be equal to that of C and G at the synonymous codon third position. However, our study showed that the frequency of A and T was not balanced with C and G at these positions, indicating that other factors such as natural selection could also be the main determinants for synonymous codon usage bias. This characteristic of TTSuV1 conferred adaptive advantages, which resulted in a highly efficient dissemination of the virus by different modes of transmission.",
