Moreover, it is important to monitor changes in antigenicity, severity, transmissibility, and antiviral resistance in the southern hemisphere to compare with those of the spring and winter outbreaks in the northern hemisphere. We construct simple mathematical models using the epidemiologic data for these southern hemisphere countries to draw timely and useful conclusions regarding the role played by the new pH1N1 strain under the setting of a typical winter influenza season.",

The parameter t\nm is related to the turning point ti (defined as the time when the rate of case accumulation changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa) of the epidemic by the simple formula t\nm = t\ni + (ln a)/r, where ln denotes the natural logarithm function. By fitting cumulative case data of a particular outbreak, these four quantities, namely, the growth rate r, carrying capacity K, inflection point t\ni, and exponent of deviation a of the model, can be obtained simultaneously using standard software such as MATLAB or SAS.",

The turning point ti can be easily pinpointed by locating the inflection point of the cumulative case curve, i.e., the moment at which the trajectory begins to decline. This quantity in time has obvious epidemiologic importance, indicating either the beginning of a new wave of infections (i.e., moment of acceleration after deceleration) or the end of the current wave of infections (i.e., moment of deceleration after acceleration).",

When there are indeed two or more waves of infections, a variation of the S\u2010shaped Richards model has been proposed,\n14\n which distinguishes between two types of turning points: one in the initial S curve that signifies the first turning point that ends initial exponential growth (or a downturn in case number) and a second type of turning point in the epidemic curve where the growth rate of the number of cumulative cases begin to increase again (or a upturn in case number), signifying the beginning of the next wave of infections. This variation of the Richards model provides a systematic method of determining whether an outbreak is 1\u2010wave or multi\u2010wave in nature, and is designed to isolate the main turning points from those peaks and valleys resulting from the data stochasticity. More details on the multi\u2010wave Richards model can be found in,\n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n where 2003 SARS incidence curves for the Great Toronto Area and Singapore are shown to contain two peaks (local maximum or turning point of the first type) and one valley (local minimum or turning point of second type).

Using the daily confirmed case data, the 1\u2010wave model fit gives a turning point of June 26, while the 2\u2010wave yields 3 turning points, one \u2018downturn\u2019 tuning point for each wave around June 1 and June 24, and an \u2018upturn\u2019 turning point on June 4 signifying the start of the second wave.

The estimates for R in Argentina and New Zealand obtained by using different estimates of generation interval (T) for 2009 pH1N1 in the literature are also in close agreement (8, 9). The results indicate that higher values of T will raise all the estimates for R, as can be expected from the formula for R given earlier. For the Argentina hospitalization data with T = 1\u00b791\n18\n, R = 1\u00b727 is obtained; whereas using a T value of around 2\u00b77\n21\n we have R = 1\u00b740 (see Table 8B). Both estimates are within reasonable range. However, the discrepancy becomes larger for larger values of R (see next to last row, Table 8A), thus indicating the dependence of R on accurate estimate of T. The corresponding estimates for other countries are similar and hence are omitted for brevity.",

For example, a few imported cases at the early stages that set off a fast\u2010spreading disease locally (e.g., pandemic influenza) would have a decidedly different effect when compared to the situation with imported cases scattered over a long period of time for a less transmissible disease with no apparent asymptomatic infections such as SARS, unless there are very fast\u2010developing local clusters of infections or nosocomial spread, as in the 2003 SARS outbreak. A study on pH1N1 epidemic in Victoria, Australia, indicates that, by using methods designed to account for the undetected transmission caused by unidentified imported cases, the mean estimate for R reduces dramatically from 2\u00b74 to 1\u00b76.\n26\n\n",
