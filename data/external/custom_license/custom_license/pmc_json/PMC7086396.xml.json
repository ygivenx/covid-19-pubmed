The synthesis of the second and\nthird fragments (ISG15(29\u201359) and ISG15(60\u2013165), Figures S1 and S4) proceeded without complications.\nWe did not encounter problems in the synthesis or in the following\npurification step. Contrary to this, in the synthesis of the first\nfragment, ISG15(2\u201328), we found that after coupling the first\n14 amino acids, the fragment was poorly soluble and the HPLC showed\nbroad, tailing peaks, without a major peak that corresponded to the\nproduct. On the basis of our previous experiences in the synthesis\nof difficult proteins, installing a side chain solubilizing tag (e.g.,\nattached through a phenylacetamidomethyl (Phacm) linker to a Cys residue)\ncould significantly improve protein synthesis.17\u221219 Upon introduction\nof this solubilizing tag onto the temporary Ala11Cys mutation, we\nwere glad to see that the synthesis of this fragment has improved,\nbut to our disappointment, we found that this fragment (even with\nthe solubilizing tag) was tailing in the column, rendering its separation\nand purification very challenging and its final isolation in a very\nlow yield.",
