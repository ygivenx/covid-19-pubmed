            "text": "An outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 which carried with it a fatality rate of 8% was traced to a novel coronavirus dubbed the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This novel coronavirus was eventually classified as a Group IIb coronavirus, a subset of the Group II coronaviruses. The subclassification was, in part, due to the presence of several accessory genes in the coronavirus which have no known homologs within the family Coronaviridae. These accessory genes have been the subject of study by many groups (for reviews, see 1 and 2) and have been assigned a plethora of physical characteristics and intracellular functions. Most importantly, almost all of these accessory genes have been shown to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, with the exception of the 3a accessory gene (3). It has been suggested these accessory genes have subtle effects on SARS-CoV replication and may be more important for viral replication or pathogenesis in vivo.",

Several groups have undertaken to characterize the protein product of the ORF6 gene and found that it interacts with the nsp8 protein from the SARS replicase complex (5), is able to increase infection titer during early infection at low multiplicity of infection (6), increase the rate of cellular gene synthesis (7), inhibit interferon production (8), and inhibit the nuclear translocation of STAT1 by interacting with karyopherin \u03b12 (9). Most recently, the ORF6 protein has been suggested to induce intracellular membrane rearrangements resulting in a vesicular population in the infected cell which could possibly serve some role in increasing replication (10). Such virus-induced or virus associated vesicles have previously been shown in other viral infections, such as protein trafficking in Herpes simplex virus (11) and Sendai virus (12). Members of the coronavirus family have been shown by several groups to also utilize vesicular structures within the infected cell; most of these studies suggest that vesicles play a role in viral replication (13-16).",

However, there has been, to date, little work done to link the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein to its known functions. Gallagher and co-workers have shown that the ability of ORF6 to impede nuclear translocation resulted in the suppression of expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs if these need transcription in the nucleus (17). Using this knowledge, a simple co-transfection system and alanine substitution mutants in the ORF6 gene are used here to determine regions of the ORF6 protein that modulate its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8. The subcellular localization of these mutants is then examined by immunofluorescence experiments and compared to that of wildtype ORF6.",

The nsp8 gene from SARS-CoV was cloned using BamHI and XhoI sites into pXJ40myc to create pXJ40myc-nsp8, with an N-terminal myc tag for detection. GST was cloned into pXJ40flag to create pXJ40flag-GST, which expresses an N-terminal flag tagged GST protein. The ORF6A49-52 and ORF6A53-56 mutants were generated by 2 rounds of PCR: the first round of PCR was used to generate 5' and 3' fragments of ORF6 containing the appropriate alanine substitutions; these were then amplified into full-length ORF6 using end primers for the ORF6 gene and cloned into pXJ3'HA using BamHI and XhoI sites.

Briefly, the Ct for the GAPDH control was subtracted from the Ct for the nsp8 gene (\u0394Ct). The fold changes were then calculated from the \u0394\u0394Ct, which was obtained by subtracting each \u0394Ct from the \u0394Ct obtained when 2 \u03bcg of pXJ3'HA vector was used.

Western blotting showed a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of nsp8, concomitant with an increase in the expression of ORF6 (Figure 1A). In order to determine the specificity of this effect, Vero E6 cells were cotransfected with another mammalian expression construct pXJflag-GST and pXJ3'-ORF6 in the same manner as previously done with the construct encoding for nsp8. When titrated against increasing amounts of ORF6 protein, the flag-tagged GST protein was also observed by Western Blotting to show reduced levels of expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). Thus, it seems that ORF6 exerts an effect on the expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs regardless of the nature of the transgenes. However, when increasing amounts of GST were titrated against nsp8 in the same manner, no significant reduction in nsp8 expression was observed, indicating that this effect was specific to the ORF6 protein (Figure 1C).",

Quantification of the signals in each lane of the resulting autoradiograph was performed and the readings were normalized to the reading in the lane from the untransfected cells (Figure 2). When 1 \u03bcg of DNA was used, there is a slight decrease in the total cellular protein synthesis in ORF6 expressing cells when compared to cells which had been transfected with empty vector. However, almost the same degrees of decrease in the total cellular protein synthesis were observed in both pXJ3'HA and pXJ3'-ORF6 transfected cells when 2 \u03bcg of DNA was used. Hence, the decrease in total cellular protein synthesis observed seems to be related to the transfection process rather than the expression of ORF6.

This allowed us to then use pXJ3'-ORF6-transfected Vero E6 cells to further study the characteristics of this vesicular population. In addition to Lamp1, CD63 (a marker for late endosomes) was used to examine the compartmental characteristics of the vesicles. As shown in Figure 4B, ORF6-positive vesicles coincide significantly with CD63-positive vesicles in Vero E6 cells.

Hence, Vero E6 cells were transfected in the same manner and instead RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed and subjected to SYBR Green QPCR using primers for nsp8. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene in order to normalize the expression levels seen. When pXJmyc-nsp8 was co-transfected with 1 \u03bcg of pXJ3'-ORF6, ORF6A49-52 or ORF6A53-56, the levels of nsp8 mRNA were similar (Figure 5C). However, at 2 \u03bcg, the levels of nsp8 mRNA for both ORF6 mutants were slightly higher than wild-type ORF6 (Figure 5C). In order to determine if these differences are statistically significant, 5 independent experiments were performed, and the results were then used to perform a t-test measuring the significance of the difference between nsp8 expression levels when either 2 \u03bcg of wildtype ORF6 or 2 \u03bcg of each mutant were used. The difference in nsp8 expression when co-transfected with either wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A49-52 is not statistically significant (a two-tailed p-value of 0.08). On the other hand, the difference in nsp8 expression when co-transfected with either wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 is statistically significant (a two-tailed p-value of 0.01). This indicated that the reduction in the suppression of the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8 by ORF6A53-56 was significant, and therefore that the putative diacidic motif defined by amino acids 53-56 has a role to play in this ability of the ORF6 protein. The ORF6A49-52 mutant did not show as high a level of significance.",

Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with either pXJ3'-ORF6, pXJ3'-ORF6A49-52 or pXJ3'-ORF6A53-56 and subjected to immunofluoresence analysis. It was observed that the localization of ORF6A49-52 was somewhat similar to wild-type ORF6 with main expression in distinctive vesicles (Figure 6). However, slightly more ORF6A49-52 than wildtype ORF6 was found to spread diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. The ORF6A53-56 also has some cytoplasmic staining but it was also observed that this mutant protein localized to vesicles that were clustered into groups of 3-5 vesicles to form large aggregates. Careful examination of the localization of the wildtype protein did not yield similar observations of clusters. This indicated that the putative diacidic motif from amino acids 53-56, in addition to being involved in the suppression of the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8, is also involved in the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein and therefore these 2 phenomena may be linked.",

Our results indicate that the putative diacidic motif is involved in both the suppression of expression of co-transfected expression constructs by ORF6 as well as its subcellular localization. While we were not able to completely restore the expression of co-transfected nsp8 in our system, the effect on nsp8 mRNA level between wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 was nonetheless found to be significantly different. However, the difference is small and suggests that the diacidic motif is largely dispensable for this function of ORF6. In contrast, the putative lysosomal targeting motif YSEL does not appear to contribute to these properties of ORF6 and this is consistent with a recent report that alanine substitution of the region from amino acids 49 to 53 fails to inhibit the ability of the protein to impede the nuclear translocation of STAT1 (9). Also, others have shown that the ORF6 protein induces membrane rearrangements and that the C-terminus of the protein is important to this function. Our results show that the region from amino acids 53 to 56 is involved in the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein, since alanine substitution of this region results in a clustered-vesicle phenotype that is not observed with wildtype ORF6. The reason for the difference in the subcellular localization of wild-type ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 mutant is not clear. One possibility is that the substitutions of four acidic residues with alanine residues might have reduced the solubility of ORF6. Alternatively, the substitutions may have disrupted the interaction of ORF6 with certain host proteins.",

The implication of this is that the 2 functions may be inextricably linked. However, a cause-effect relationship has yet to be determined for these functions and in light of our findings, their relationship to the membrane rearrangements induced by the ORF6 protein should be examined in future studies. In addition, while the ability of ORF6 to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs, was previously linked to the blockage of nuclear translocation (17), further experiments are needed to ascertain if amino acids 53-56 are involved in regulating the nuclear translocation process.",
