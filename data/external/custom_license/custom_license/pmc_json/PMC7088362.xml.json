            "text": "In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) emerged as a new agent of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), causing a global outbreak that led to significant morbidity and mortality [1\u20133]. Even in the absence of worldwide transmission, high vigilance is necessary because SARS has the potential to re-emerge. Screening for SARS-CoV among all patients with CAP is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because false-positive results may have profound infection control implications and lead to unnecessary social disruption [1]. Moreover, such screening is not cost-effective [4]. Therefore, the CDC recommends that SARS-CoV testing be considered in hospitalized patients with radiologically confirmed CAP, provided (a) no alternative diagnosis is identified within 72 h after the initial clinical evaluation, and (b) the patient is thought to be at high risk for infection with SARS-CoV. The risk factors include travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan 10 days before the onset of illness, close contact with sick individuals who traveled to these areas recently, a relevant occupational exposure to SARS-CoV, or association with an unexplained cluster of pneumonia [1]. The epidemiological linkage, however, is often ambiguous and may not be useful in \u201cnodal\u201d areas like Hong Kong [2, 5]. Furthermore, the yield of diagnostic tests for CAP is generally low [3, 6]. As the early clinical and radiological features of SARS are rather nonspecific, risk stratification for SARS-CoV testing remains a difficult task. Previous studies have shown that certain hematological/biochemical changes (e.g. lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver transaminases) may be useful in the diagnosis of SARS [7\u201312].",

We followed the investigation protocol suggested by the CDC, using antigen detection tests to identify common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus. Such tests, if performed upon initial presentation of the patient, generally provide results within a few hours. These rapid diagnostic tests are useful because they allow specific treatment (e.g. oseltamivir) to be administered, which is especially important under the current threat of another influenza pandemic [3]. Moreover, they can help exclude SARS by confirming an alternative diagnosis, which is an efficient and cost-effective strategy in managing undifferentiated febrile respiratory illnesses during SARS outbreaks, if reliable epidemiological links are not available [4].",

CAP was diagnosed by physicians in the medical department if symptoms were suggestive of acute lower respiratory infection (e.g. fever, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea) and were accompanied by acute lung infiltrates evident on chest radiographs, and if the patient had been neither hospitalized within the previous 14 days nor residing in a long-term-care facility [3\u201316]. Chest radiographs were reviewed retrospectively by a radiologist blinded to all clinical information except for a provisional diagnosis of CAP. Patients in both groups were excluded if they had underlying hematological conditions (e.g. myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma) or AIDS, had received long-term treatment with immunosuppressants, or were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Patients with CAP who were admitted directly to the intensive care unit (ICU) on presentation via the emergency department were not recruited because of a different investigation/treatment protocol [8], whereas patients transferred from the medical department to the ICU due to clinical deterioration were not excluded.",

High-dose rescue corticosteroid treatment was added in the second week of illness only when patients deteriorated [13, 15]. All but three patients had documented pneumonic changes on their plain chest radiographs, and a diagnosis of SARS was eventually confirmed by either serological tests (93%) or repeated positive RT-PCR assays (7%) [14].

As the data were not distributed normally, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were used to summarize continuous variables. In the univariate analysis, a nonparametric test (Wilcoxon\u2019s rank sum test) was used to compare the baseline values and changes (by days 3 and 5 of admission) of each variable between the two cohorts. The chi-square test was used to compare demographic/clinical variables whenever appropriate. The presence of comorbidity was defined according to systemic illnesses listed in the Pneumonia PORT Severity Index scoring system [3, 16]. Significant variables identified in the univariate analysis (p < 0.05) were then entered into separate stepwise logistic regression models together with age, gender, and comorbidity to identify discriminating laboratory changes at baseline and day 3 of admission, respectively [7]. Stepwise methods using the log-likelihood ratio test were performed to see whether the inclusion of new covariates helped to improve the fit of the logistic regression model. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each model, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated as a measure of discriminative ability for individual/combined variables. In general, AUC \u22650.90 can be regarded as \u201cexcellent\u201d, 0.80 to <0.90 as \u201cgood\u201d, 0.70 to <0.80 as \u201cfair\u201d, and < 0.70 as \u201cpoor\u201d. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were provided as estimates of the effect sizes. We also calculated the sensitivity and specificity of independent discriminating variables, using various cutoff values. SAS statistical software (release 8.02; SAS, Cary, NC, USA) was used for the analyses, and the level of significance was set at 0.05 for all comparisons (two-tailed).",

[8], who found that only the baseline ANC might discriminate \u201cprobable\u201d SARS-CoV from other causes of CAP by univariate analysis. In addition, we have further demonstrated that even by days 3 and 5 of admission, SARS has few discriminating laboratory changes. The discriminatory ability of ANC observed in Muller\u2019s study and in ours likely resulted from the changes in the comparative arm, which consisted mainly of patients with treated bacterial pneumonia [8, 16]. In bacterial pneumonia, neutrophilia is common, and favorable clinical and laboratory responses after appropriate antibiotic therapy usually become evident by day 3 (e.g. resolution of fever and neutrophilia) [6, 16]. The initial transient neutropenia, followed by a gradual increase in neutrophil count as SARS progressed (even before high-dose corticosteroid treatment), might have exaggerated the difference slightly [13, 15, 18]. Similar findings were also noted in a separate analysis (as mentioned in the \u201cResults\u201d section) that compared SARS-CoV with other respiratory viral pathogens causing CAP (unpublished data) and in two other independent studies that compared SARS with febrile respiratory illnesses or pneumonia [10, 19]. However, we agree with Muller et al. [8] that the role of a \u201clow-to-normal\u201d ANC alone in discriminating SARS-CoV from other causes of CAP is likely limited. Changes of bilirubin concentration in CAP patients might also represent resolution of sepsis [20], and a small increasing trend of bilirubin in SARS patients might have exaggerated the difference [21]. We also noted that lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, though prevalent in SARS patients and previously suggested to have diagnostic value in uncontrolled studies, in fact have little discriminatory abilities on their own [7, 8, 10, 18, 19, 22]. Marked lymphopenia and moderate thrombocytopenia tended to occur late in SARS [18]. On the other hand, mild-to-moderate lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia might occur in CAP patients, thus minimizing the differences [10, 23]. Elevated liver transaminases and high C-reactive protein levels (which might indicate a bacterial etiology of CAP) were not useful discriminatory variables according to our analyses [16, 21].",

When managing CAP patients at high risk of infection with SARS-CoV but in whom the etiology remains undiagnosed after rapid antigen detection tests for common respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and RSV, (a) an absence of neutrophilia (ANC <4.4 \u00d7 109/l) on presentation and (b) poor clinical and laboratory responses (change in ANC >\u22123 \u00d7 109/l or change in bilirubin \u22650 mmol/l in patients <65 years) after 72 h of appropriate antibiotic treatment may raise the index of suspicion and indicate the need for SARS-CoV testing, as these variables appear to be quite specific for SARS (95% with each model). Investigation for other viral respiratory pathogens and atypical pneumonia pathogens is also worthwhile because infection with such pathogens can mimic SARS clinically [4, 24, 25]. Because of the low sensitivities (43\u201364%) of these criteria, about half of the SARS cases will not be identified. We therefore emphasize that monitoring routine laboratory changes can play only a supportive role in the diagnostic algorithm of SARS. The absence of these laboratory changes should not exclude SARS-CoV testing.",

With a larger SARS cohort, multivariate analyses were performed and we were able to analyze the serial changes in laboratory variables. The study is limited, however, by its retrospective nature and the fact that we were unable to compare SARS-CoV against specific/individual etiological agents and different disease severities, as the number of diagnosed CAP cases in the control group was too low. Positive predictive values of the discriminating laboratory features are also expected to be low in the absence of worldwide transmission of SARS (i.e. low prevalence rate) [1], and it is therefore important to interpret such findings in the context of patients considered to be at high risk of infection with SARS-CoV. Further evaluation of the role of monitoring routine laboratory changes in other cohorts and in combination with epidemiological, clinical, and radiological variables using the \u201cclinical prediction rule\u201d approach for risk stratification may be warranted [7, 9]. It is worth pointing out again that the key component of epidemiological linkage can be elusive during the interepidemic period.",
