IBV is the causal agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), which is characterised by respiratory and/or renal and/or reproductive disease [5]. The clinical signs can be accompanied by mortalities in broiler chickens and reduced egg shell and albumin quality in layer hens, leading to economic loss for poultry farmers. Many different IBV strains have been isolated and classified around the world [3, 10, 26] since IB was first identified in the United States in the 1930s [1]. Notably, international strains have been constantly diverging, creating a distinct and diverse sub-lineage of IB exclusive to countries such as Australia [11, 26, 28]. The types of strains identified in Australia to date have been classified as either subgroup 1, 2 or 3, [10] or unrelated field strains.",

Due to the airborne nature of IBV transmission [6], biosecurity alone is not always an effective control measure. As a consequence, vaccination protocols are widely implemented [24]. The use of live-virus vaccines, however, may involve reversion of the vaccine virus to virulence and subsequent disease [9]. It is therefore important to determine if disease is a result of infection with a vaccine strain (reverted to virulence), a known virulent field strain, or a previously unidentified IBV strain so that appropriate measures can be taken.",

Homologies of \u226595% generally indicate that strains are related [4, 10]. However, the S1 gene is one of the most variable regions of the IBV genome and may be subject to recombination events [12, 13, 17]. Although S1 gene sequencing is considered the gold standard for IBV identification, it is often not rapid enough to allow an adequate response to an IBV outbreak. Detection and characterisation of IBV strains by sequencing analysis can take weeks; however, an IBV infection only lasts 3\u201310 days [5]. The inability to achieve rapid identification severely restricts the implementation of appropriate measures to prevent spread and reoccurrence.",

However, the efficiency of PCR, as determined by the quantity of PCR products on an agarose gel (Fig. 1), was low for a number of IBV strains (all subgroup 2 and three strains) using the Del1-F primer compared to the PCR performed using All1-F, despite using comparable quantities of template cDNA in both reactions. This indicated that the All1-F forward primer was more efficient than the Del1-F primer. Alignment of all available nucleocapsid-3\u2032UTR sequences for the Australian IBV strains revealed a number of mismatches between the sequence of the oligonucleotide primer Dell-F and these IBV strains (a representation of this alignment is shown in Fig. 2).

Current techniques for IBV strain identification require virus isolation from infected tissues in SPF eggs to produce high-quality RNA for efficient PCR and S1 gene sequencing. The technique developed in this study is comparatively faster as it utilises a small PCR product that can be generated directly from infected tissue (unpublished data), obviating the need for viral isolation. Indeed, the entire procedure described here (from receipt of infected tissue to HRM analysis) can be completed in <5 h. This is much faster than conventional DNA sequencing, which takes at least 24 h (provided that the relevant equipment is readily available), excluding subsequent comparison and interpretation of the sequencing results. In terms of cost, the described method also has further advantages over sequencing as the Syto-9 dye is the only added cost to standard PCR. This does not include the initial outlay for the real-time thermocycler, although with the introduction of RT-PCR for a variety of pathogens, a real-time thermocycler is now becoming an essential piece of equipment in many diagnostic laboratories. The skill required to perform HRM and interpret the related results for strain identification is easily gained, with many diagnostic laboratory technicians already possessing the relevant skills.",

This ultimately produced GCPs that did not accurately represent their nucleotide sequence identities with their respective related strains, although both of these isolates could still be classified correctly based on the distinctive shapes of their conventional melt curves. It was observed that the GCPs for the different IBV strains fell either within this range, just outside this range (GCP of 60\u201380), or far below this range (GCP value <30).

The additional, smaller DNA band that was amplified during PCR of the VicS vaccine strain [20] is likely to have caused this discrepancy by modifying the shape (broadening the peaks) of the curve produced. The appearance of the two DNA bands after PCR of the 3\u2032UTR in VicS suggested mis-priming by one or both of the primers used; however, analysis of the respective area of the VicS vaccine genome did not reveal any region with similarity to either of the primers. Thus, it seems unlikely that mis-priming was responsible for amplification of a second product by any of the primers. In recent studies in our laboratory, the nucleotide sequences of the two PCR products amplified from the commercial VicS vaccine strain were determined. The smaller band was identical in sequence to the larger band, which matched the published VicS sequence, except that it contained a 40-bp deletion in the amplified region (unpublished data). Thus, it is suggested that the commercial VicS vaccine contains two populations of viruses with different 3\u2032UTRs, making mathematical analysis of this vaccine impossible. Irrespective of the origin of the two strains in the VicS vaccine preparation, this demonstrates a further capacity of the HRM curve analysis for detection of more than one strain in a single preparation. Additional studies are required, however, to investigate the ability of HRM to differentiate simultaneous IBV infections.",
