            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs), which can be viral or bacterial, are one of the most common reasons for visits to primary and urgent care clinics [1]. Given their overlapping profiles of signs and symptoms, distinguishing between ARIs of bacterial and viral aetiology can be clinically challenging [2]. Clinical uncertainty regarding the infection aetiology, along with other factors (e.g. patient or parental pressure or expectations [3]), frequently results in the prescription of antibiotics for infections of probable viral aetiology despite no likely benefit [4\u20136]. The unnecessary or inappropriate prescription of antibiotics can have broad negative consequences, including contributing to the rise and spread of antimicrobial resistance (itself considered one of the biggest threats to global health) [7, 8] and unnecessarily exposing the patient to the risk of adverse events (including life-threatening events, e.g. anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Clostridium difficile infection) [9\u201311]. As well as negatively affecting patient health and care (at both the individual and population level), these effects are also associated with significant economic costs [12\u201314].",

CRP is a non-specific acute-phase protein that serves as a sensitive and early marker of inflammation, tissue injury or infection [20\u201323]. CRP levels become markedly elevated in the presence of a clinically significant acute bacterial infection and, as such, CRP measurement can play a role in the diagnosis of such infections; however, CRP is not considered to be sufficiently specific as a marker on its own to differentiate between bacterial and viral infections [20\u201326]. MxA is an intracellular GTPase protein that is induced by type I and type III interferons [27] and which serves as a sensitive and specific marker for viral infection [28\u201332]. MxA has antiviral activity against a broad range of pathogenic viruses, and interferon production in response to viral infection leads to an increase in MxA levels [27]. The rationale behind the FebriDx test is that through measurement of CRP and MxA together, it can combine the sensitivity of CRP with the specificity of MxA such that, when used together in a rapid point-of-care test, these markers can serve to aid in the differentiation between viral and bacterial ARIs [16].",

Briefly, the fingertip is lanced using the built-in lancet; the blood sample (~ 5 \u03bcL) is drawn into the blood collection tube through capillary action and is delivered (via a blood transfer zone) to the test strip; the test is activated when buffer solution is delivered by pressing the buffer release button. Results should be read after 10 min. A positive result for MxA (with or without a positive result for CRP) is indicative of a viral infection. [In the case of a positive result for both MxA and CRP, viral and bacterial co-infection cannot be excluded; however, co-infection (i.e. a host response to both a bacterial and viral infection) is uncommon in ARI (2\u20138% of cases [36\u201338])]. A positive result for CRP but not MxA is indicative of a bacterial infection. The absence of a positive result line for both CRP and MxA indicates a negative result, suggesting that the patient lacks a significant systemic response; however, a negative result does not exclude a respiratory infection and should not be used in isolation as the basis for diagnosis and patient management decisions. For any individual test performed, the absence of a positive result for the control line indicates an invalid test result. FebriDx test results are stable for up to 1 h [16, 19].",

An algorithm based on the reference testing data was used to classify patients. Under both the FebriDx testing and the reference testing algorithm, patients were classified as a having a bacterial ARI, a viral ARI, or negative for a clinically significant ARI. Additionally, a panel of two physicians with expertise in respiratory infections, and who were blinded to the FebriDx test results, reviewed each individual patient case report together with the reference testing results and could overrule the reference testing algorithm classification to give the final reference classification [34, 35].",
