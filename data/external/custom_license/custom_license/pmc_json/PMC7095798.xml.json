There's also the fact that they have lots of species diversity. More than 1,200 species of bats exist on Earth, accounting for approximately 20% of all mammalian species. The enormous range of bat species might contribute to why there are so many different bat-borne pathogens. \u201cTo say that bats are natural reservoirs of disease would be a simplistic view because there's so much diversity even within bats. Some species of bats can get sick with a certain virus while other species don't,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Kevin Olival of the EcoHealth Alliance, a New York\u2013based international organization dedicated to conserving biodiversity.",

Researchers believe that because flight is such an energy-intensive process, it can generate DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species, which trigger an immune response. Having a naturally heightened innate immune response would prime bats to withstand a range of viruses. Furthermore, when bats fly, their body temperature also goes up, so they might thus have more tolerance for pathogens that cause life-threatening fever in other mammals (Emerg. Infect. Dis., 20, 741\u2013745, 2014).",

For example, wild waterfowl, such as mallards and shorebirds, have a cytoplasmic protein called RIG-1 (retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene 1) that senses RNA viruses (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 107, 5913\u20135918, 2010). RIG-I has the ability to turn on a \u201cmassive interferon response,\u201d in wild waterfowl, allowing these birds to fight avian influenza, according to Katherine Magor, a biologist at the University of Alberta in Canada who studies the immune system of wild birds. Chickens, in contrast, lack RIG-1 and are therefore more susceptible to infection with avian influenza. The adaptive immune response is rapidly switched on in certain rodents, such as deer mice or cotton rats, so that these animals can live comfortably with hantaviruses without appearing sick themselves (Viruses, 6, 1317\u20131335, 2014).",

They first examined the gene expression profile of Australian black flying foxes, the reservoir for the Hendra and Nipah viruses, and found that these bats have approximately 500 transcribed genes involved in immunity, only a fraction\u2014about a third\u2014of the number of known human immune genes (BMC Genomics, 13, 261, 2012). A comparison of the genome of bats with that of other mammals such as humans, mice and chimpanzees revealed that genes associated with the innate immune response, such as those that encode interferon receptor 1, interleukin-18, interferon-gamma, and toll-like receptor were positively selected for in bats compared to humans and mice (Science, 339, 456\u2013460, 2013). Many of these genes, according to Wang, also a co-author on the Science study, could help explain why bats have a more effective immune system that allows them to to prevent these viruses from replicating so that the viruses don't cause disease in the animal.",

Now Zhou continues to study bat immunology at Duke-NUS Medical School with Wang. Interferons are signaling proteins produced and secreted by cells in response to infection that can activate the adaptive immune response. Zhou found that bats were making interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) RNA even when they were not infected with any detectable virus. \u201c[IFN-\u03b1 RNA] is almost undetectable in other mammals that are not stimulated with a virus, whereas in bats, IFN-\u03b1 RNA is already very high even without viral challenge,\u201d Baker says. What is considered to be a normal baseline IFN-\u03b1 level for bats would be toxic to humans or mice, potentially causing flu-like symptoms or organ damage. Unpublished data from Baker's lab showed that IFN-\u03b1 RNA levels in bats hardly increased even when they were challenged with a range of viruses like Hendra, another bat virus called Pulau virus, and a murine virus called Sendai. The high baseline levels of IFN-\u03b1 RNA, according to Zhou, could explain why bats can coexist with viruses without appearing sick. \u201cHowever, how bats can tolerate those consistently high levels of IFN-\u03b1 remains widely unknown,\u201d Zhou says.",
