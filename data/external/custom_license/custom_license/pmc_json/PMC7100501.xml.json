It refers to an acute inflammatory process involving nasopharynx, oropharynx or hypopharynx. Viral infections are the most common cause of acute pharyngitis and they are usually benign and self-limited [2]. Bacterial organisms are also capable of inducing pharyngitis and they usually involve more severe disease processes. The most important form of bacterial pharyngitis is group A streptococcal pharyngitis for which antimicrobial therapy is definitely indicated [2]. However, bacterial pharyngitis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae is rare. The most common clinical findings of acute pharyngitis of the pharynx include erythema, ulcers, exudates and vesicles, but not malignant tumor-like mass lesions. Herein, we report a case of bacterial pharyngitis caused by K. pneumoniae with the gross appearance surprisingly mimicking hypopharyngeal malignancy. The clinical chart of this patient was reviewed following Institutional Review Board guidelines.",

His past medical history included liver cirrhosis, and he had smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years. No fever, tachycardia, stridor or dyspnea was noted. On physical examination, the oral cavity appeared normal and no neck lymphadenopathy was identified. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy disclosed a large hypopharyngeal tumor with limited movement of bilateral vocal cords and critical airway (Fig. 1). Laboratory examinations revealed leukopenia (3,400/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (86,000/mm3), and biochemistry analysis showed hypoalbuminemia (3.2 g/dL), hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 1.77 mg/dL), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (80 U/L) and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (40 U/L). Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were within normal limits. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 4.12 mg/dL (reference 0\u20130.5 mg/dL). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an increased amount of soft tissue at the right pyriform sinus with a maximal diameter of 5.6 cm, compatible with hypopharyngeal cancer (Fig. 2). Tracheostomy was performed to establish an adequate airway, and a tumor biopsy was performed via direct laryngoscopy. However, the pathology report of the frozen specimen showed no evidence of malignancy, and the final pathology revealed ulceration with necrosis, inflammation and granulation tissues (Fig. 3). To rule out Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis, we checked the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), p-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), c-ANCA and urine analysis and all results were normal. Seven days later, a bacterial culture of the tumor tissue revealed growth of K. pneumoniae. Concentrated acid-fast stain of the tumor was negative. A mycobacterial culture of the tumor tissue kept for up to 8 weeks also revealed negative result. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was prescribed according to antibacterial susceptibility testing, and dramatic regression of the tumor was noted after 2 weeks of treatment.\n\n\n",
