            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus [7, 8, 17]. Its genome contains genes for the spike (S), membrane (M), small membrane (sM), open reading frame (ORF) 3, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2, 4]. The M protein is a structural membrane glycoprotein and the most abundant of all the envelope proteins. It has a short amino-terminal domain on the outside of the virion and a long carboxy-terminal domain on the inside. The M protein plays a central role in PEDV assembly. Together with the sM protein, it is responsible for assembly of the PEDV envelope [1, 9, 21]. In addition, the M protein directs the incorporation of the S protein [13, 15] and the nucleocapsid [12] into the budding particle.",

PEDV was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978. Since then, outbreaks of the disease have been reported in several swine-raising countries, most notably in Europe and Asia, including Japan, China, and Korea [11]. It causes heavy economic losses in the European and Asian swine industry and is an important gastrointestinal disease [7, 16]. Several vaccines have been applied to the regions with a high prevalence of PEDV, but these vaccines have not been completely effective in preventing the disease [6, 18]. Since early 2006, PEDV has been re-emerging in immunized swine herds in China [5, 20]. In late 2010, outbreaks of PED occurred in HeBei province. Pigs of all ages were affected and losses from this disease outbreak were extensive. Most of the affected farms lost 100 % of their newborn piglets. In order to identify the genetic heterogeneity of the prevailing strains in China, PEDV strains were isolated from fecal samples from piglets infected with PEDV in 2010. The M genes were cloned and sequenced for analysis of genetic diversity, and the phylogenetic relationships of the field isolates with other PEDV reference strains were also analyzed.",

Although the bi-combined attenuated vaccine against TGEV and PEDV infection is authorized for use on swine farms, PED still occurs in the immunized swine herds in China. Since late 2010, outbreaks of PED have occurred in Hebei province. Most of the affected farms lost 100 % of their newborn piglets. PEDV is known to have only one serotype, but the genome shows wide genetic diversity [3, 10, 22]. The structural M protein of PEDV plays an important role in the assembly process and induces virus neutralization antibodies [14]. Therefore it is necessary to investigate the prevalence of PEDV on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the M gene of the field strains of PEDV in China.",

            "text": "This study was conducted to characterize PEDVs isolated from the fecal samples of piglets suffering from severe diarrhea in Hebei province of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The initial aim of this study was to isolate and investigate the genetic diversity among field strains of PEDV in China. A large amount of sequence data on PEDVs isolated throughout the world has been published over the years and is now available for sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. In this study, seven Chinese field strains of PEDV were isolated. The complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the M gene were determined and compared with those of the reference strains. None of the seven isolates were found to have sequence insertions or deletions in the M genes, although all the PEDV isolates investigated in this study had nucleotide mutations. Analysis of sequence homology showed that the seven PEDV isolates were closely related to PFF188, M-NIAH1005, and JS-2004. Furthermore, HB\u2013HS and PFF188 had identical nucleotide sequences, although they were isolated in different countries at different times. This suggests that HB\u2013HS might have been generated naturally from PFF188. However, lower amino acid identity was observed between the seven PEDV isolates and the Chinese isolates CH-IMT-06, HN/XYYYP, YM/2007. Phylogenetically, they belonged to three different clusters. Although the seven isolates and the other Chinese isolates belonged to the same cluster, they were segregated into different sub-clusters. These results showed that a new genotype of PEDV prevails in China now. None of the seven PEDV isolates was phylogenetically close to the vaccine strain CV777 that is used in China. In fact, they were segregated into different sub-clusters. In addition, the seven Chinese isolates also had a change in the antigenic regions 2\u201314 though there has no scientific data to prove whether this change had brought about antigenic variation. All these results show that, in spite of the regular use of live vaccines in pigs, the seven field isolates of PEDV were of a different genotype able to cause outbreaks in immunized pigs in Hebei province. In conclusion, genetic variation exists in the M gene of the prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates, and a more appropriate vaccine strain should be chosen to prevent PEDV outbreaks in China.",
