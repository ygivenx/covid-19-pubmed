            "text": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease and a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. It is characterized by the loss of lower motor neurons, which results in progressive atrophy of voluntary muscle groups leading to paralysis and eventually premature death [1]. It is caused by the deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene in more than 95% of SMA patients [2]. Humans have a second nearly identical copy of this gene, SMN2 [2]. The majority (\u223c90%) of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 due to a translationally silent C-to-T transition +6 nucleotides within exon 7 [2\u20134]. Skipping of exon 7 during pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing leads to the production of a truncated and only marginally functional SMN protein product [5]. The 10% of SMN2 transcripts that contain exon 7 and which produce full-length functional SMN protein cannot adequately compensate for the loss of SMN1 unless high copy numbers of SMN2 are present, in which case the severity of the disease is reduced [6,7]. Therefore, the focus of most current therapeutic strategies is to increase the expression of SMN protein by induction of exon 7 inclusion in SMN2.",

For the treatment of SMA, an SSO is being developed by Ionis/Biogen Pharmaceuticals for use in infants and children, which has progressed to phase III clinical trials after promising data from open-label phase II studies and this drug, called Nusinersen, is expected to be approved soon for clinical use [10]. However, this type of SSO is not able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to reach the target motor neurons in central nervous system (CNS), hence the need for delivery through intrathecal injection to obtain broad CNS distribution. In a recent study on intrathecal administration of Nusinersen (ISIS-SMNRx), it was reported that, despite its great effectiveness, 32% of patients have developed side effects such as headache, back pain, and postlumbar puncture syndromes [11], possibly due to the use of an intrathecal delivery technique. There is thus a strong impetus to explore the development of noninvasive and efficient delivery systems for therapeutic SSOs to enter brain and spinal cord through the circulation.",

Despite the transduction efficiency of viral gene delivery, the use of viral delivery vehicles is limited due to the immunotoxicity of the viral coat protein and potential oncogenic effects [12]. However, in the case of neuromuscular diseases, considerable progress has been made in the use of nonviral delivery vectors, particularly synthetic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). In the case of DMD, conjugations of various Arg-rich peptides to exon skipping PMOs have given rise to dramatic improvements in levels of in vivo dystrophin production in skeletal muscles in mouse models [13\u201317], and we have extended this to heart muscles using a new range of such peptides known as Pip [18,19]. In very recent studies in SMA mouse models, we have found that a conjugate of PMO to Pip6a peptide, following intravenous delivery, was able to direct significant exon inclusion in the brains and spinal cords of SMA model mice in addition to skeletal muscles [20].",

Several peptides have been reported for their BBB permeability either alone or carrying a bio-cargo [22,24\u201327]. Thus, in parallel to our recent study of the Arg-rich Pip6a peptide as a PMO carrier into brain and spinal cord of an SMA mouse, we asked whether it was possible to identify other peptide types capable of simultaneously enhancing muscle cell penetration of a PMO bio-cargo into skeletal muscle tissue as well as delivering a splice-switching PMO into the CNS of SMA mice. Thus, we screened and tested two main types of alternative peptide-PMO (P-PMO) conjugates, in one case where the peptide component might be expected to utilize a receptor-mediated BBB transcytosis mechanism as well as in the other case some cationic P-PMOs that might be subject to absorptive-mediated BBB transcytosis similar to Pip6a.",

Thus, we first used a two-stage cellular splice-switching screen to gauge the cell uptake efficiency and the pre-mRNA targeting ability of these conjugates. Preliminary screening for muscle cell penetration was carried out using the well-established exon-skipping assay in the DMD mouse mdx muscle cell line that has a high dynamic range. A second-stage testing then involved induction of SMN2 exon 7 inclusion in a human SMA patient-derived fibroblast cell line. Several of the most cell-active peptides that passed both these screens were then tested as PMO conjugates in a newborn mouse model of SMA carrying a human SMN2 transgene, by measurement of the level of exon 7 inclusion after intravenous injection at postnatal day 4 (PND4). This led to the identification of a branched ApoE (K\u2192A) peptide candidate, which as a PMO conjugate was demonstrated to show a dramatic improvement in the lifespan of homozygous newborn SMA mice with median lifespan \u223c15 days [28] to 78 days and two SMA mice surviving to 280\u2013290 days. The ability of this branched peptide in delivery of exon-including PMO into the CNS was then also evaluated in adult SMA mice through intravenous administration and we showed that it is able to deliver PMO into the CNS and restore full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA.",

Peptides were precipitated in ice-cold diethyl ether and the peptide pellets were washed three times in ice-cold diethyl ether. PepC7 and branched (Br) PepC7 peptides were further modified postsynthesis by formation of a disulfide bond. The first disulfide bond was easily formed by oxidizing the cysteine residues by first dissolving the linear peptide in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 solution (1 mg/3 mL, pH 8) followed by addition of a 1 mM solution of 2,2\u2032-dipyridyldisulfide (DPDS) in methanol (0.2 mL/1 mg). Since there was no change in the retention time of the oxidized peptide, the formation of a disulfide bond was confirmed by the Ellman's test [29]. The formation of the second disulfide bond was carried out by simultaneous removal of Acm-protecting groups and oxidation of cysteines. Br-PepC7 was dissolved in acetic acid (2 mg/mL) and 60 mM HCl solution (5% v/v) was added followed by addition of iodine (10 eq/Acm) as a 20 mM solution. The progress of the reaction was monitored using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Due to the slow rate of oxidation, the amount of iodine was increased to 20 eq/Acm group. Following the completion of the reaction after 30 min, the peptide was precipitated in cold diethyl ether. The peptide pellet was dissolved in water and 20 mM ascorbic acid solution was added to quench the remaining traces of iodine.

The purified peptides were conjugated to the PMOs through an amide bond between the free carboxyl group at the C-terminal of the peptides and a secondary amino group at the 3\u2032-end of the PMO. Peptides were dissolved in NMP to a concentration of 50 mM and the PMO was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 10 mM. A 2.5-fold excess of peptide over PMO was used. The peptides were activated using HBTU:HOBt (2.5:2) and conjugated to the PMO in the presence of a fourfold excess of DIEA. The reaction was carried out at 40\u00b0C for 2 h. Some of the P-PMOs were treated with hydrazine (20 eq) for a further 15 min to deprotect the ivDde and ODmab-protecting groups before purification. The positively charged P-PMOs were purified on a high-resolution-16/10 cation-exchange column (GE Healthcare) using 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 25% acetonitrile. The same buffer with 1 M NaCl added was used to elute the P-PMO. The removal of excess salts was achieved by centrifugation using an Amicon\u00ae Ultra-15 3K centrifugal filter device. The P-PMOs with no positive charge were purified using RP-HPLC with a 0.1% TFA buffer. The trifluoroacetate counter ions were removed by dissolving the lyophilized P-PMO in 5 mM HCl solution and filtered as above [31]. The concentrate (\u223c300 \u03bcL) was washed three times with deionized water to remove excess HCl before lyophilization. The overall yields of P-PMO conjugates ranging from 30% to 45% based on the starting amount of PMO as determined by ultraviolet absorbance at 265 nm.",

The myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes for the exon-skipping assay as previously described [32]. The exon-skipping assay was carried out by incubating the myotubes with appropriate concentrations of P-PMOs dissolved in serum-free Opti-MEM for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The transfection medium was then replaced with DMEM/5% horse serum and cells incubated for a further 20 h at 37\u00b0C. The level of exon-23 skipping for tandem ApoE-PMO and branched ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO was also measured in the presence of serum. The P-PMOs (1 \u03bcM) were preincubated in 50% mouse serum for 1 and 2 h before transfecting the cells. Total RNA was isolated from H2K mdx cells using TRIzol\u00ae (Sigma, UK). RNA (500 ng) was used to carry out complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and primary polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of dystrophin DMD transcripts using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as previously described [32].

First, we conjugated the peptides to a well-validated 25-mer Dmd PMO sequence and measured splice-switching activity in differentiated H2K skeletal muscle mdx cells through measurement of the levels of DMD exon-23 skipping [19,48\u201351]. This cell assay has a very high dynamic range and is thus a good primary screen for general cell delivery and RNA-targeting ability. All P-PMO conjugates showed a concentration-dependent increase in exon-23 skipping (Fig. 1A\u2013C). Among the P-PMOs designed for BBB receptor targeting, ApoE (141\u2013150)-PMO conjugate showed the highest exon-skipping activity in mdx cells that was statistically greater than that for PMO alone (Fig. 1A). In the cases of P-PMOs, where the peptide component has an unknown mode of BBB crossing, SynB3-PMO, SynB3-PFV-PMO, and PepC7-PMO showed exon-23 skipping activity in mdx cells higher than that of the naked PMO (Fig. 1B). The branched and linear dimers of ApoE showed significantly higher activity at lower concentrations than for the monomeric ApoE (141\u2013150)-PMO (Fig. 1C), whereas PMO conjugates of a dimer of PepC7 and the chimera of ApoE-PepC7 did not improve exon skipping activity of single P-PMOs (Fig. 1C). The modified branched construct Br-ApoE-PMO (K\u2192A) was equally active in exon skipping as its unmodified counterpart at 500 nM, but at 1 \u03bcM it was less active than its counterpart (Fig. 1C). In the case of the tandem ApoE-PMO and the branched Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO conjugates as a check on serum stability, exon skipping was also assessed after treatment of the conjugates with 50% mouse serum. Exon skipping levels decreased significantly for both P-PMOs after 1 h of serum treatment, but the level remained unaltered after 2 h treatment (Fig. 1D), which demonstrated that although the peptides are prone to proteolysis in serum, a reasonable level of splice-switching activity was nevertheless maintained.",

The level of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA increase following P-PMO treatment was measured using RT-PCR. Although the dynamic range of this cell assay is not as large as for the DMD mdx muscle cells, all P-PMO conjugates tested showed concentration-dependent increases in the levels of full-length SMN2 mRNA in the fibroblast cell assay (Fig. 3). Whereas untreated cells showed a level of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA of ca. 65%, SSO-treated cells showed increases up to 85% with the concentrations used. The Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO conjugate showed the highest exon inclusion activity, which is consistent with the results obtained for the first round screening for DMD exon skipping activity in H2K mdx cells.

We chose a neonatal SMA mouse model that allows for screening of a larger number of P-PMOs than is the case for adult mice and at a lower dose, which, therefore, reduces the synthesis requirement. Thus, neonatal SMA mice (Smn1tm1Hung/wt; SMN2tg/tg and Smn1wt/wt;SMN2tg/tg) [33] at PND4 were treated with P-PMO conjugates (2.66 nmol, two doses at 10 mg/kg). PND4 is the most developed stage in which a pup can be treated by facial vein administration. The effect of the P-PMOs on the increase of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA was determined by measurement of the changes in the levels of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA relative to total SMN2 transcripts 7 days after treatment by quantitative PCR (qPCR; Fig. 4A). Among the P-PMOs tested, Br-ApoE (K\u2192A) was the only conjugate which displayed SMN2 exon 7 inclusion activity in all three organs tested, that is, brain, kidney, and quadriceps, whereas the levels of SMN2 exon 7 inclusion activity for other P-PMO conjugates were not statistically significant compared with the saline and naked PMO-treated groups. The level of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA in the brain measured for Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO (1.35 \u00b1 0.11, n = 5) was higher than that for saline-treated (1 \u00b1 0.05, n = 4) and naked PMO-treated mice (1 \u00b1 0.02, n = 6). Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO also displayed a significantly higher activity in a skeletal muscle (quadriceps) tissue (2.1 \u00b1 0.21, n = 5) as well as in kidney (1.5 \u00b1 0.14, n = 5) (Fig. 4B).",

The Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO was found to restore full-length SMN2 both in the CNS as well as in the periphery. Treatment of adult SMA mice with 6 weekly doses of 10 mg/kg Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO resulted in significant changes in the levels of full-length SMN2 transcript in kidney, in all three regions of the spinal cord and in the brain stem, although no changes could be detected in the cerebellum and cortex (Fig. 6). In addition to qPCR, we tested the levels of SMN protein in saline- and Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO-treated tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2). A significant increase in the level of SMN protein was observed in kidney. Unfortunately, the western blots were not sensitive enough to detect significant changes in protein expression in the spinal cord, despite increases in the levels of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA detected by qPCR. Serum chemistry from adult mice collected after two doses of 10 mg/kg Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO, Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-scrambled PMO or untreated was analyzed for alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine, urea, and total protein.

The PMO sequence PMO20, also known as HSMN2Ex7D(\u221210,-29), has been previously studied by Porensky et al. [61]. Single ICV injections (27, 54, and 81 \u03bcg) of this PMO in newborn SMN\u03947 mice at P0 increased the levels of both full-length SMN2 RNA transcript in the brain and spinal cord as well as SMN protein and yielded an increased survival of >100 days. In a similar study, Zhou et al. [65] used the same PMO sequence [PMO20 (\u221210, \u221229)] as well as PMO18 (\u221210, \u221227) and PMO25 (\u221210, \u221234). The survival data obtained following ICV injection of PMO25 (40 \u03bcg/g) was comparable to that of PMO20 obtained by Porensky et al. In this study, the PMO was conjugated with an octa-guanidine dendrimer (vivo-morpholino), which were shown previously to be effective for splice switching in DMD mice [66]. However, an ICV injection (10 mg/kg) of vivo-PMO25 designed for SMN2 exon 7 inclusion led to the death of all mice and a dose of 4 mg/kg resulted in hydrocephalus [66]. Systemic administration of vivo-PMO25 also failed to restore full-length SMN2 in the brain, demonstrating the limitations of an octa-guanidine dendrimer as a PMO delivery vector into the CNS.",

This current study was aimed at cellular and in vivo screening to identify other novel peptides active both in splice switching in cells (muscle and SMA patient fibroblasts) and in systemic delivery of a PMO SSO into SMA mouse models to restore SMN2 expression both in skeletal muscle as well as in the CNS. The SMA mouse pup model is particularly relevant to the disease since SMN protein is required for motor neuron development during the early postnatal stages of development [69\u201371]. Exon inclusion of SMN2 pre-mRNA and increase of the SMN protein level can lead to the extension of survival, which can serve as a good phenotypic readout.",

However, in subsequent cell viability evaluations (Fig. 2), a high level of cytotoxicity was observed for these P-PMOs, perhaps due to the very high number of cationic amino acids [72]. By contrast, cytotoxicity was significantly reduced when we replaced Lys residues by Ala in [Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO], to give a branched peptide having less positive charges, but splice-switching efficiency was still maintained. Lys residues were substituted rather than Arg due to the suggestion of more efficient cell-penetrating ability by Arg-containing cell-penetrating peptides than for Lys [73]. In line with the DMD exon-skipping results in H2K mdx cells, Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO showed the highest splice-switching activity in further screening in SMA type I fibroblasts for SMN2 exon 7 inclusion (Fig. 3), which is an established SMA cell assay, but with a lower dynamic range than in the prescreen using the DMD exon-skipping assay.",

Thus, whether the exon inclusion seen in adult SMA mice in brain and spinal cord by systemic Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO injection occurs in neurons, glial cells, or endothelial cells, or some combination, cannot currently be determined, but the extension of survival seen in the severe SMA mice may suggest that at least some exon inclusion could be occurring in neurons.",

Therefore, a body-wide increase in full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA through exon inclusion demonstrated in our results and, therefore, in SMN protein, is more desirable than just in the CNS. The current clinical trials with Nusinersen are carried out using multiple intrathecal injections. This can have several drawbacks, including complications related to lumbar puncture, poor CNS distribution of SSOs and lack of any therapeutic benefits for the peripheral pathological component of the disease. A recent study in SMA mice has also shown that subcutaneous administration of several low doses of PMO had a greater effect in increasing the average survival of SMA mice than a single high-dose ICV bolus injection [79]. In this study, however, we have shown the greater benefits of using a P-PMO conjugate as compared with a naked PMO oligonucleotide by a significant alleviation of the SMA phenotypes.",

However, this peptide is longer and contains a higher number of positively charged Arg residues. Initial indications are that Pip6a may not have a sufficiently favorable therapeutic index for clinical development (Godfrey et al., unpublished results). It is clear from the current study that novel peptides are discoverable beyond the Pip series of which Br-ApoE (K\u2192A)-PMO is the first new example for SMA application. Ongoing work aims to carry out detailed in vivo studies in parallel of both activity and toxicology to identify novel peptides with acceptable therapeutic index that may be suitable leads for drug development. However, we believe the current work paves the way for the development of a peptide-based systemic delivery platform into both skeletal tissue and CNS for SSO treatment of SMA that perhaps might be extended to other neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.",
