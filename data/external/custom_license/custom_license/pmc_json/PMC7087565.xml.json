            "text": "Hendra virus (HeV) was first described in September 1994, associated with an outbreak of novel acute respiratory disease in horses in a training stable in Brisbane, Australia (Murray et al. 1995; Baldock et al. 1996). It resulted in the deaths of 14 horses and their trainer, and caused a febrile illness in a second stable worker (Selvey et al. 1995). To date, 90 horses and seven people are confirmed or suspected to have been infected with HeV in 48 reported incidents (http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/animal-industries/animal-health-and-diseases/a-z-list/hendra-virus/general-information/what-is-hendra-virus, accessed 4 December 2013). Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus (Halpin et al. 2000; Field 2005). While the incidence of infection is low in both horses and humans, the high case fatality rate (~80% in horses, ~60% in humans) (Field et al. 2010; Playford et al. 2010) engenders a high level of concern in horse-owners and trainers, veterinarians, para-veterinary professionals and the general public. All human cases have been associated with close contact with infected horses (Playford et al. 2010), so minimising the risk of infection in humans is predicated on minimising infection in horses. Horses are putatively infected following mucosal contact with infectious flying-fox excreta or body fluids (Field et al. 2000; Halpin et al. 2000). While a vaccine for horses has recently become available (http://www.qldhorsecouncil.com/Hendra-Virus/Hendra-Vaccine.aspx, accessed 4 August 2013), uptake has been limited, with a little over a quarter of the estimated horse population at risk in eastern Australia having been vaccinated to 30 October 2013, notwithstanding encouragement from government, the veterinary profession and the horse industry. (Kung et al. 2013; http://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/news/agriculture/general/news/hendra-vaccine-hits-150k/2676692.aspx, accessed 4 December 2013). Thus, emphasis remains on reducing horse exposure to infection.",

We used the model to explore implications of relative HeV infection risk under a number of practical scenarios\u2014specifically, at different latitudes, in different years, at different times of year and in different microclimates. Additional environmental factors undoubtedly influence HeV survival in the environment, but a lack of empirical data precluded their inclusion in the model.",

Virus inoculum was diluted in EMEM supplemented with 1% FCS; 5 mL was added to each 150 cm3 flask of cells and the flask was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After incubation, the inoculum was discarded and the remaining inoculum washed off with EMEM. Fifty millilitres of EMEM supplemented with 1% FCS was added to each flask and the flasks incubated at 37\u00b0C. When the cytopathogenic effect neared 100%, the tissue culture supernatant (TCSN) was poured off, clarified by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7g for 10 min and stored in 0.5 mL volumes in sterile tubes. Eight tubes were titrated in Vero cells prior to treatment. Briefly, tenfold dilutions from 10\u22121 to 10\u22128 of each TCSN were made in EMEM without FCS. Then, 50 \u03bcL of each dilution was added to ten wells of a flat-bottomed microtitre plates (Nunc), followed by 50 \u03bcL of EMEM without FCS and 100 \u03bcL of Vero cells in EMEM with 10% FCS. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days and the presence or absence of cytopathic effect in each well recorded. The titre in TCID50/mL in each tube was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938).",

The effect of temperature was obtained from a regression of half-life against temperature (Fig. 2). The half-life at each hour over the 4 days was calculated from the polynomial regression line in Figure 2 by randomly choosing a normally distributed value within the 95% prediction interval around the regression line for the estimated temperature at that hour.

We used data from the first 4 days of each month for simulations. The change in temperature was simulated as a cosine wave with the minimum temperature being at 3 a.m. and the maximum at 3 p.m. At each hour, the breakdown rate for that temperature was applied. It is acknowledged that on particular days, the minimum and maximum temperatures may occur at times that differ from this and that there may be departures from a cosine wave during any particular day. However, this simplification is unlikely to alter our results in any meaningful manner. Data on hourly temperature are not readily available for the span of years, nor for the six HeV incident locations which we used in our model (Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton (all Queensland), Murwillumbah and Kempsey, New South Wales\u2014Fig. 3). The locations span the latitudinal range of reported HeV incidents, and cover the range of temperatures likely to be experienced by HeV excreted into the environment.\n\n",

Additionally, the simulated mean virus survival rates for each month at each location were compared with the cumulative monthly occurrence of equine HeV cases (current till end of November 2013).At each location, simulated virus survival was estimated for each season for 1993\u20132012 (using January, April, July and October to represent summer, autumn, winter and spring mid-points, respectively). This provided an indication of the inter-year variation for the same month of year.We then examined relative virus survival to midday following initial excretion at five preceding timepoints over a 12-h period\u20146 p.m. on previous day, 9 p.m., at midnight, 3 a.m. and at 6 a.m. This was done for summer (January) and for winter (July) at Rockhampton (other locations gave similar patterns of results, but with different magnitudes\u2014data not shown).To examine possible microclimatic effects, we lowered the maximum temperature by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5\u00b0C to determine the effect on HeV survival at 24 h. This was done for summer and winter at Rockhampton.We compared mean monthly survival for Hendra case years and non-case years for all locations to determine if there were any consistent differences between HeV survival in years when equine cases were reported (1994, 1995, 1999, 2004, 2006\u20132013) and in years when no equine cases were reported.\n",

While (for logistical purposes) we limited this study to detailed consideration of six locations, all reported incident locations are effectively within this gradient, thus our findings have broad relevance. The identified between-location trend of increasing virus survival from north to south was not unexpected, given the decreasing mean temperature gradient. Similarly, the seasonal association with virus survival was not unexpected, reflecting the within-year temperature profile. However, the magnitude of within-location temperature variability (and subsequent differences in survival\u2014Table 2) over the 20-year period was quite large and may offer a fundamental insight into the spatially sporadic nature of equine HeV cases. Temperatures conducive to substantial HeV survival can occur in any of the locations used in this study and in many/most months of the year.",

However, the difference is surprisingly modest and less than the variation in survival between years for excretion at a single timepoint. This simulation was prompted by a common horse\u2013owner query regarding a \u2018safe\u2019 time to return horses to a paddock where flying-foxes were active overnight. Our findings preclude a definitive answer to this question on the basis of temperature alone. Clearly, exposure risk decreases with temperature over time, but other environmental factors also influence risk. HeV is very sensitive to desiccation (Fogarty et al. 2008). Multiple environmental factors contribute to desiccation (rainfall, humidity, UV index, microclimate) and undoubtedly influence HeV survival in the environment as well, but a lack of empirical data precluded their inclusion in our parsimonious model. In addition to environmental factors, ecological (Plowright et al. 2008) and husbandry factors (Kung et al. 2013) may also influence exposure risk. At a practical level, the recommendations of Biosecurity Queensland (http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/animal-industries/animal-health-and-diseases/a-z-list/hendra-virus/general-information/reducing-the-risk-for-horses, accessed 5 August 2013) include excluding horses from paddocks where flying-foxes are active, and covering horse feed and water points.

If HeV survival in an organic medium (fruit debris, spats, faeces) is greater than in urine, and if these organic media also buffer virus from desiccation [another environmental factor influencing virus survival in experimental studies (Fogarty et al. 2008)], then such material further prolongs virus survival.

Such a correlation is biologically plausible, given that lower temperatures extend virus survival time, which in turn increases the \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 of effective exposure for a horse. While the findings of Fogarty et al. (2008) suggested such an association, their experimental study was limited to two temperature points. Our model is based on additional data using real temperature data from real case locations, adding support to that putative association. The absence of reported cases to date in the (Australian) autumn months of March and April, when the temperature profile is similar to that of spring months (in which cases have been reported) can plausibly be explained either by chance, or by the additional negative influence of other seasonal factors on virus survival. The occurrence of the first reported February case in 2013 supports the former, and the likelihood is that cases will eventually be reported in all months. The more pronounced peak of cases June to August is consistent with the presence of additional risk factors at this time, or alternatively may reflect the unprecedented mid-year cluster of cases in 2011.",

Consistent with our contention regarding HeV, some of this work also suggests a role for additional factors such as ultraviolet radiation (Weber and Stilianakis 2008).",

The intent was not to illustrate actual survivability, but rather relative survivability and thus relative exposure and infection risk for horses. Figure 5 indicates that theoretically, up to 30% of virus may remain in the environment after 4 days. This projection reflects the effect of temperature in isolation; actual survivability will be much shorter, because actual survivability will reflect the effect of a range of factors in addition to temperature. As discussed earlier, desiccation, pH and substrate are additional factors known to influence virus survival in laboratory studies (Fogarty et al. 2008). In an environmental context, climate factors such as humidity, rainfall, wind and ultraviolet radiation intensity will undoubtedly contribute to actual HeV survival. There may well be additional, as yet unidentified, factors.",

Our simulation modelling shows, first, that virus survival varies with location and with season, and second, that factors such as the timing of virus excretion during the night and microclimate account for less variation in virus survival than does temperature variation between years. Finally, and importantly, the model shows that the effect of ambient temperature on the survival of virus in the environment mirrors both the annual clustering of HeV cases in the Australian winter, and occasional sporadic cases at other times of year. We do not contend that temperature is the sole or primary driver for infection in horses, nor that temperature alone influences virus survival in the environment, but rather that it constitutes part of a \u2018sufficient cause\u2019 paradigm, as previously proposed (Field et al. 2011). Further work is required to elaborate other contributing causal components.",
