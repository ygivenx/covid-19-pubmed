Modern transportation and increased tourism, business travel, and immigration contributed to dissemination of these high-impact pathogens. The effectiveness of interventions such as airport screening, travel restrictions, and other community mitigation measures remains uncertain. However, human migration has occurred for centuries and will continue, despite the threats posed by microbes.",

We need to be able to identify these populations of travelers and characterize them appropriately so we can better identify modifiable risk factors and target interventions to keep travelers safe and healthy during and after their journeys.",

The fields of travel and tropical medicine usually are associated with preparing tourists for international journeys or evaluating such travelers when they return sick. Articles in this issue demonstrate a much broader concern because of the existence of many different types of globally mobile populations. This issue features articles on some of those populations: refugees, immigrants (legal and not), long-term travelers, pregnant travelers, guest workers, soldiers, cruise ship passengers, and imported animals (1\u20136). These extremely different populations share a characteristic: they travel from one part of the world to another, placing themselves or others at risk for exposure to novel conditions and pathogens that can adversely affect their health.",

The risks of travel in developing countries are known; however, imported infection also can originate in wealthy countries and on luxury cruise ships (5,10).

Much of the medical literature, including the articles in this issue, still focus on defining populations and describing diseases and conditions associated with certain groups or activities. Relatively few of these articles recommend or evaluate new interventions to keep globally mobile populations safer and healthier. Investigators and public health authorities need to start making this shift towards scientific evaluation of interventions that can lead to using this evidence to begin shifting toward recommendations for efficient, cost-effective methods to prevent illness in refugees, immigrants, and travelers. At the same time, all disease- or pathogen-specific guidelines from national and supranational bodies should explicitly address globally mobile populations. Studies that measure the impact of pretravel guidance, vaccines, and prescription of prevention or self-treatment medications will then follow.",
