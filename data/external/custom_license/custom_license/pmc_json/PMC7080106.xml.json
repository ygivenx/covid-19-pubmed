In the SARS outbreak there was a realistic possibility of restricting and eventually preventing global disease transmission. In an influenza pandemic this is extremely unlikely to be achievable. There is a theoretical possibility that if the potential pandemic were to be detected very early, the combination of preventing all travel from the geographical area and widespread administration of effective antiviral agents to minimise the risks of disease transmission might just prevent its progression\u2014but for logistical reasons this is unlikely to be successful. The production and distribution of a widely applicable generic influenza vaccine could also theoretically prevent a pandemic\u2014but may take considerable time and cannot be guaranteed to be fully effective. It is therefore sensible to plan on the basis that a pandemic may still cause significant numbers of patients to become seriously ill.",

Although these risks may be slightly reduced by a number of agreed local or national policies such as cancellation of major social events, etc., there is no real prospect that the national transmission of an influenza virus can be prevented by such restrictions. School closures may also be considered an appropriate strategy to reduce the risks to children and their role in virus transmission, but any benefits of this may be offset by the impact on parents being unable to attend work because of the necessity to provide home care, and any alternative structures for providing group child-care for children will almost certainly restore the same risks of virus transmission as school attendance.",

Although there is limited scientific evidence to support their use, community wearing of protective facemasks may have some benefit in reducing aerosol particle spread in symptomatic individuals. The use of antiviral agents may also reduce the severity of influenza symptoms and hence the risks of disease transmission, but this cannot be guaranteed until the efficacy of the drugs against the virus has been assessed.",

The necessity to encourage complete use of such equipment for full shift episodes will almost certainly be influenced by the adequacy of storage reserves, the risks (and severity) of disease transmission and the availability of appropriate vaccine protection. Although there is some evidence that wearing of surgical masks may have a role in reducing the risks of viral transmission [11], there are still valid concerns that these may not be sufficiently protective for the number of aerosol-generating procedures in the ICU environment. It is therefore important to adhere to the basic principles of reducing the risk of disease transmission via aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) by ensuring appropriate PPE staff training [12] (e.g., fit-testing for N95 respirators, avoiding contamination when placing/removing, environmental cleaning, etc.) and on maintaining standard measures for hand hygiene, surface cleaning, etc., which should be rigorously adhered to.",

Failure to perform these activities and to provide reassurance to staff are likely to significantly undermine confidence and hence reduce staff availability. Lack of confidence may influence not only attendance, but also willingness to undertake challenging additional responsibilities and hence impact on patient care and protection. Therefore, in the presence of uncertainty, staff protection should start at the highest level and then be gradually reduced. Institutions should prepare formal reassurance plans for legal protection and for the provision of assistance to staff working outside their normal domain. Debriefing and communication may reduce psychological stress for both patients and staff. Given the medical-legal implications of many decisions, comprehensive documentation is essential. Support of relevant professional organisations and medical/nursing authorities will also benefit members working outside their normal areas of expertise.",

Staff training should include information relating to the likely duration of the event and reassurance (if appropriate) about when a return to normal working practice may be anticipated. Although this may have limited benefit for the care of acutely ill patients whose risks of recovery may be influenced by lack of resources, for patients with more prolonged conditions (e.g., awaiting transplantation or elective surgery), it is likely to be beneficial if reassurance about future care can be given. Advance contingency planning in accordance with local or national guidance for expanding capacity will also potentially improve the ability to cope with excess demand, and the engagement of staff in this process may help to reduce the discomfort caused. Failure to maximise the use of the resources available is likely to cause demoralisation, particularly if colleagues, relatives or friends suffer as a result.2.Necessity to decrease patient admissions or limit escalation of care.\n",
