            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is classified as a member of Group I of the genus Coronaviruses, the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh and Britton 2008). PEDV is an etiologic agent of diarrhea in pigs, especially newborn pigs (Cavanagh 2005; Cavanagh et al. 1993). PEDV disrupts villus enterocytes and causes villious atrophy within the jejunum and ileum, leading to a mortality rate of up to 95 % in infected piglets (Ducatelle et al. 1981). The genome consists of a single molecule of linear positive-sense, single-stranded RNA. The complete sequence of the entire genome of strain CV777 was found to be 28,033 nucleotides in length excluding the poly A-tail (Kocherhans et al. 2001). The viral encoded-proteins from the PEDV genome have four structural proteins: a large spike glycoprotein or peplomer (S, 180\u2013220 kDa), an integral membrane glycoprotein (M, 27\u201332 kDa), a small envelope protein with a small amount of virions, and a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N, 55\u201358 kDa) (Cavanagh and Britton 2008; Egberink et al. 1988). Spike proteins attach viral particles to receptors on the host cells and subsequently penetrate into the cells by membrane fusion. The S glycoprotein also stimulates induction of neutralizing antibodies in the host (Duarte and Laude 1994; Yeo et al. 2003). The S glycoprotein is, therefore, essential for the development of a vaccine against PEDV. The predicted polypeptide was 1,383 amino acids long containing 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and showed structural features similar to those of the coronavirus spike protein (Duarte and Laude 1994). The S glycoprotein of PEDV lacks a proteolytic site to yield cleaved amino and carboxy subunits, S1 and S2, but can be divided into the S1 domain (1\u2013789 amino acids) and the S2 domain (790\u20131,383 amino acids) based on the presence of the conserved nonamer and GxCx motifs at the proteolytic cleavage site of S protein in other members of coronavirus, Group II (Follis et al. 2006). Based on the sequence information for the neutralizing epitope of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus, Chang et al. identified the neutralizing epitope region of PEDV (CO-26 K equivalent, COE gene) as containing 139 amino acids spanning the region of 499\u2013638 amino acids within the S1 domain (Chang et al. 2002). In previous studies, the synthetic COE (sCOE) gene of PEDV, which was modified based on the plant-optimized codon usage, was expressed in tobacco plants (Bae et al. 2003; Kang et al. 2004, 2005). The sCOE gene fused with an Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin B subunit (LTB) gene was expressed in transgenic tobacco plants (Kang et al. 2006), rice seeds (Oszvald et al. 2007) and lettuce plants (Huy et al. 2009). Alternatively, the sCOE gene fused with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) was expressed in lettuce plants (Huy et al. 2011). The COE gene is, therefore, considered to be an important target in the development of subunit vaccine against PEDV infection.",

However, the low expression level of antigens in transgenic plants induces low immune responses and immune tolerances in animal models. This limitation is an important bottleneck that stands in the way of developing plant-based edible vaccines. One solution is to increase antigen delivery into mucosal immune systems via ligands, such as cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) and a variety of B subunits of toxins. Recently, Kim et al. (2010a) showed that the M cell-target peptide ligand, Co1, in orally treated mice enhanced the uptake of fused antigen into the effective sites of mucosal immune systems and immune responses against fused antigen as compared to antigens alone.",

PED is one of the most devastating diseases in suckling piglets, and it frequently occurs in Korea (Lee and Yeo 2003). Therefore, it is important to develop an effective vaccine to protect pigs against PEDV infection. The COE epitope of PEDV spike glycoprotein showed neutralizing activities against PEDV (Chang et al. 2002); the COE epitope alone or fusion proteins with mucosal carriers have been expressed in various kinds of plants, including tobacco (Kang et al. 2005, 2006), lettuce (Huy et al. 2009, 2011) and rice endosperm (Oszvald et al. 2007). Rice is one of the most important food crops and the staple food for more than half the world\u2019s population, particularly in Asian countries (Khush 2005). Recently, a transgenic rice grain has been developed for use as a mucosal vaccine, which possesses several advantages (Takagi et al. 2005; Takaiwa 2007; Tokuhara et al. 2010). In the present experiment, prior to development of transgenic rice, the synthetic COE\u2013Co1 fusion protein was produced in transgenic rice calli, and its immunogenicity was tested in mice.",

These plants should decrease the required amount of plant-based edible vaccine because it is often painful for animals to consume a large amount of plant material during a short period of time. A lower expression level of antigen protein in transgenic plants means that the feed amount has to be increased, which can be painful and stressful to animals. In addition, oral immunization of a vaccine with low expression level of antigens in transgenic plants induces low immune responses and immune tolerances. The improvement of the expression level of antigen genes in transgenic plants and the delivery of plant-produced antigens into the mucosal immune system could result in enhancement of immune responses. The COE gene, which has been modified based on the plant-optimized codon usage, produces fivefold higher levels of antigens than that expressed with the native gene (Kang et al. 2005). The expression level of recombinant protein under the control of RAmy3D expression system showed a 1,000-fold enhanced expression level in a rice suspension culture system (Shin et al. 2003). In the present study, codon optimization of the target gene and RAmy3D promoter expression system were applied, and the expression level of the COE\u2013Co1 fusion protein was approximately to 0.083 % of TSP in transgenic rice calli at day 3 after induction.",

The use of ligands to deliver vaccine antigens into mucosal immune systems should be considered to overcome the low immune response in plant-based edible vaccines. The cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) have been used to deliver fused antigens into mucosal immune systems and have efficiently induced immune responses. However, these ligands have a size limitation of fused antigen proteins for assembling biologically active ligand-fusion proteins and cannot be used repeatedly in mice previously immunized with CTB and LTB fusion proteins. The M cell-target peptide ligand Co1 (with 12 amino acids) has been shown to be an effective delivery method of Co1-fused antigen to mucosal immune inductive sites through M cell targeting without a size limitation of fused proteins and induces the enhanced immune responses against the fused antigen as compared to those of the antigen without a ligand (Kim et al. 2010a).",

The precipitation of plant-produced antigen with ammonium sulfate is a non-specific way to increase the amount of proteins and is acceptable for developing animal vaccines (Molina et al. 2005; Martinez et al. 1992).
