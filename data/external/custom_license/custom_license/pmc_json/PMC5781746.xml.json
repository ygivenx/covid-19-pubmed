Improvement in molecular technologies in the past ten years allow us to simultaneously test respiratory viruses such as human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (FluA), parainfluenza virus-1 (PIV-1), parainfluenza virus-3 (PIV-3), human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), adenoviruses (AdV) and a panel of newly discovered viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), HCoV -NL63, human bocavirus (Boca), human polyomavirus KI (KIV) and human polyomavirus WU (WUV). The simultaneous detection of a broad spectrum of viruses allows the identification of viral co-infection in upper respiratory infections (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). In this study establishing a link between viral co-infections and an increase in disease severity can be thought-provoking.",

Among the 351 patients diagnosed with viral infections, HRV was detected in 41.9%, FluA virus in 15.1% and RSV in 13.1%. Viral co-infection was detected in 49 patients (14%) with HRV being the most common virus associated with co-infection (26 patients or 7.4%), followed by AdV (14 patients or 4%) and HCoV-OC43 (12 patients or 3.4%). It was interesting to note that three patients had three viral co-infections. Among the 49 co-infected patients viral co-infections were common among those aged less than 1 year of age (20 patients or 40.8%). Thirty two patients or 65.3% were admitted to wards and (17 patients or 34.7%) to ICU or PICU. Furthermore, among the virally co-infected patients LRTI was the most frequent reason for hospitalization (38 patients or 77.6%).",
