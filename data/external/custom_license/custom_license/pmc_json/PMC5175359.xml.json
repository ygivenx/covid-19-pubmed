Because of the scarcity of effective treatments against EBOV, there is an urgent need to identify novel viral inhibitors that target specific viral processes. As of yet, relatively little is known about the molecular biology of EBOV replication, and, in particular, the interplay between host factors and the viral genome. The EBOV genome is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA organized into a 3\u2032 leader non-coding region (NCR), followed by seven discrete transcriptional units encoding NP (nucleocapsid protein), VP35 (polymerase cofactor and interferon-response modulator), VP40 (matrix protein), GP1,2 (glycoprotein), VP30 (transcriptional enhancer), VP24 (secondary matrix protein, ion channel and interferon-response modulator), L (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and a 5\u2032 trailer NCR (1,2). Each gene is separated by intergenic regions of varying lengths that modulate transcript levels (3).",

            "text": "The NCRs of RNA virus genomes have highly conserved primary and secondary structures (4\u20137). However, the functions of EBOV NCRs are not well characterized. Replicon systems consisting of the complete trailer and leader sequences and short segments of the L and NP protein genes that flank a reporter gene such as chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, green fluorescent protein, or luciferase have been developed (8\u201311). In these systems, transcription and replication from a replicon genome is supported by the EBOV proteins NP, L, VP35, and VP30, which are driven from co-transfected expression plasmids. Such systems allow examination of virus specific processes involving the RNA and these proteins. Addition of VP40 and GP expression plasmids can drive production of infectious VLPs (10). Using the minigenome replicon systems and/or computer-assisted secondary structure predictions, some functions have been attributed to the NCRs. Computer modeling of the EBOV trailer and leader indicate that a panhandle structure may form between the NCRs starting with base paring of nucleotide (nt) 1 and 18 957. Almost identical hairpin structures for the leader of the EBOV genome and RI RNA are possible (12). Computer modeling of EBOV mini-RI RNA and mutational analysis suggested that the 3\u2032-terminal 20 nts of the EBOV leader are not essential for infection (13). Chemical probing of the EBOV RI RNA revealed a stem-loop within the 5\u2032 end that is involved in regulating transcription (14). Additional probing analyses of mini-RI RNA suggest that the trailer and leader do not interact, but that the terminal 55 nts of the leader are important for replication (15). Recently, a direct interaction between VP30 and the 3\u2032 leader has been described, suggesting that VP30 clamps the RNA template to prevent the polymerase complex (VP35/L) from dissociation and allows productive transcription initiation in the presence of secondary structures in the template (16,17). The optimal RNA substrate for VP30 binding is a single-stranded RNA that is linked to a stem-loop, as found in the region of the replication promoter element of the EBOV genomic leader (18). Other studies further emphasize the importance of non-terminal EBOV RNA secondary structures in transcription and replication. For instance, EBOV GP mRNA editing is dependent on such secondary structures (19\u201321). Interrupting secondary structure formation inhibits synthesis of the mRNA encoding GP1,2, which mediates virion entry into host cells.",

However, few host protein\u2013viral RNA interactions have been characterized for negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Previously, the La autoantigen (Sj\u00f6gren syndrome antigen B) was shown to interact with the leader of rabies virus (30), vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (31,32), and rinderpest virus (32). La autoantigen is an RNA polymerase III transcription factor that shuttles between the nucleus and cytosol and may play a role in mRNA stability for translation. Interactions between the viral leader and La autoantigen are thought to play a role in replication. Replication is increased when the concentration of La autoantigen is increased (32) indicating a necessary functional role for host proteins to directly interact with the negative-sense viral genome. However, no specific viral RNA secondary structures that interact with La or other host proteins have been identified.",

Whether a similar interaction occurs with EBOV remains unclear, although, EBOV NP and L genes both contain a potential TOP1 target sequence (TCCTT) (33,37).",

Briefly, the area under each negative peak was subtracted from that of the corresponding positive peak. The resulting peak area difference at each nt position was divided by the average of the highest 8% of peak area differences, calculated after discounting any results greater than the third quartile plus 1.5\u00d7 the interquartile range.

Initially, probes truncated at the 3\u2032 end of the trailer were evaluated to identify host protein binding regions (Supplementary Table). Because each of the larger truncated probes was positive, further EMSAs were performed to define minimal RNA regions of the trailer. Overlapping probes were evaluated in triplicate (Supplementary Table). Background-corrected signal intensity was compared to wt probe and averaged for the replicates. Ribonucleoprotien (RNP) complex formation of probe 1\u201350 was reduced in the presence of 100\u00d7 molar excess of tRNA with a 35% reduction in binding (P = 0.024) indicating that the complex can be competed, but only at high concentrations. No reduction in RNP complex formation was observed when competed with wt, unlabeled probe 1\u201350 (Figure 1B). The 1\u2013116 probe was significantly competed with unlabeled wt probe at 10\u00d7, 25\u00d7, 50\u00d7 and 100\u00d7, and 100\u00d7 tRNA (Figure 1C).

The data suggests that the RNP complex formation is specific because low to moderate concentrations of wt competitor and the highest concentrations of tRNA were required for significant competition.",

The 3E-5E-GFP minigenome assay is a transfection-based replicon system.

Briefly the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the EBOV genome flank a eGFP open reading frame (ORF) as a reporter gene and is replication and transcription competent. Single-nucleotide changes in motif 1 of the minigenome indicated that an A30U (5\u2032AUUUU3\u2032) mutation resulted in a statistically significant (P < 0.0001) decrease in both the total number of GFP-positive cells (47% decrease, Figure 3A) and in the mean fluorescence intensity of the GFP signal (43% decrease) (Figure 3B).

Based on previous identification of VP35 as essential for replication and transcription in an EBOV minigenome assay, (55), a control omitting expression of VP35 (VP35(\u2212)) was included to determine the level of T7pol produced minigenome RNA. This control is necessary to determine the level of minigenome produced by the viral proteins. If the mutant does not impact minigenome synthesis, then the northern blot signal intensity will be increased when compared to VP35(\u2212) and equal to the wt sample. If the mutant impacts minigenome RNA synthesis, then the northern blot signal intensity will be lower than wild type or equal to the VP35(\u2212) signal or greater than the wt signal. The data indicate that four of five single point mutations, A26U, U28A, U29A and A30U, in motif 1 reduced minigenome RNA synthesis. The A30U mutant demonstrated the greatest impact and was below the VP35(\u2212) signal (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S1A), however the U27A mutant did not impact minigenome RNA synthesis. The double mutants A26U/U27A, A26U/U28A, and A26U/A30U also reduced minigenome RNA synthesis when compared to wt. These data indicate that motif 1 is involved in minigenome RNA synthesis.",

Mutants A26U, U27A, U29A, A26U/U27A, A26U/U28A and A26U/U29A demonstrated variable but near wt levels of RI RNA synthesis. These data indicate that motif 1 also plays a role in RI RNA synthesis.

Similarly, the A26U/A30U point mutations caused structural rearrangements of the panhandle duplex, again eliminating the nt 28\u201337 stem-loop and introducing a mismatch at position 15 and an additional internal loop (G19\u2013U23 and C1924\u2013U1928) (Figure 4F and Supplementary Figure S7).",

A dot-bracket notation generated by RNAstructure software was manually adjusted to account for this deletion, and subsequently provided to RNAComposer. Ten 3D RNA models were generated and analyzed, taking into account their secondary structure topology, sequence homology, structure resolution, and free energy. In addition, the quality of predicted models was evaluated using MolProbity (4.3) and KiNG tools (49,50). The models with the best topological score are presented in Figure 5, indicating the position of trailer, leader, HSPA8 motif 1 and the nt 1868\u20131890 hairpin. The wt model reveals close spatial arrangement of HSPA8 motif 1 (green) with the hairpin (blue). The presence of trailer A30U and A26U/A30U mutations changed the distance between these RNA motifs. The model presented here provides useful insight into how RNA substructures may interact during the course of EBOV replication.",

HSC70 also interacts with HCV particles; HSC70 downregulation significantly reduced virus production either via modulation of viral assembly or release (61). In addition, HSC70 was shown to be part of a protein complex that includes HCV NS5A and host proteins HSP70 and HSP40 (62) and was demonstrated to assist the NS5A/HSP70 complex essential for HCV IRES-mediated translation. HSC70 is also recruited to reovirus viral factories (63) and is present in influenza A virus (64), and vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus viral particles (65).",

Sequence analysis of the 3E-5E-GFP minigenomic RNA suggested three putative HSPA8 motifs in the trailer. However, the exact structural conformation of these regions was undefined. Thus, using chemical acylation techniques and site-directed mutagenesis, we determined the secondary structure of 3E-5E-GFP EBOV minigenome RNA and demonstrated that its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NCRs form complex long-range RNA interactions including a trailer-to-leader panhandle (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S2). Closer analysis indicates that motif 1 forms part of a small stem-loop (nts 28\u201337) that is in near proximity to the VP30 binding stem-loop (nts 1868\u20131890). To further investigate the role of the 5\u2032 terminal 50 nt in the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 interaction and the importance of HSPA8 motif 1, a deletion mutant (\u03942\u201356) was evaluated by chemical probing and in the context of an EBOV infectious clone. SHAPE data indicate that deleting trailer sequences caused structural changes within the 3E-5E-GFP minigenome RNA, mainly due to the release of the leader sequences for base pairing with complementary regions (Figure 4D; Supplementary Figures S4 and 5). These structural rearrangements did not affect the topology of other RNA domains. Experiments with the infectious clone system indicated that EBOV mutant \u03942\u201356 was not viable (Table 2). Since HSPA8 motif 1 is located within the 5\u2032 terminal 50 nts of the trailer, it is difficult to unambiguously determine if the panhandle structure or the HSPA8 motif 1 is necessary for virus growth, but such data do reinforce the importance of HSPA8 motif 1.",

These data suggest that the trailer-to-leader panhandle might indeed function as an autonomous element (Supplementary Figure S3).

In particular, single- and double- point mutations indicated that residue A30 plays an essential role in viral replication and transcription. Furthermore, northern blot data indicated a reduction in both minigenome and RI RNA production of the A30U mutant (Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S1). The A26U/A30U double mutation also resulted in reduced RI RNA and minigenome synthesis. Since the RI RNA serves a template for synthesis of the minigenome RNA, reduction in minigenome RNA most likely directly affects production of RI RNA. In addition, EMSA analysis of the A30U mutant demonstrated reduced host protein/viral RNA/RNP complex formation (Figure 3E). It is interesting that siRNA-directed (Figure 3G) or chemical inhibition (data not shown) of HSPA8 moderately reduced infectivity and viral titer, respectively, whereas EBOV genome mutagenesis that targets the HSPA8 binding motif led to nonviable virus.",

            "text": "Taken together, our structural probing, mutagenesis and reverse genetics data indicate that the conformation of the EBOV trailer and its interactions with host cell HSPA8 are essential regulators of the EBOV lifecycle. Our studies indicate that HSPA8 plays a critical role in production of viral genomic and RI RNAs. During transcription and replication, the viral genome must become a template for synthesis of progeny RNA. This process involves uncoating or at least relaxation of the viral RNP. Host factors likely interact with the viral RNP to maintain proximity of necessary factors and aid complex formation to initiate and complete these processes (67\u201369). It is likely that many of these interactions are weak and transient, acting as scaffolds for virus-driven processes. These transient interactions may assist proper RNA folding for RI RNA synthesis, transcription complex formation, or proper confirmation of packaging signals to drive discrimination by viral components to ensure effective packaging of full-length genomes and reduction of defective particles.",
