These cells expressed relatively high levels of BCL6 and low levels of BLIMP1 17. Forced expression of constitutive active STAT5 in B cells induced expression of both BCL6 and Bcl-xL and we provided evidence that BCL6 is a direct target of STAT5 in B cells. BCL6 regulates terminal differentiation facilitates in vitro expansion of B cells since ectopic expression of BCL6 in B cells inhibited terminal differentiation in vitro\n17,18. This inhibition by BCL6 facilitates in vitro expansion of activated B cells 17,19. Here we show that ectopically expressed BCL6 and Bcl-xL synergize with CD40L and IL-21 to increase the proliferative lifespan of B cells in vitro. The expanded cells have features of GC B cells, express a functional BCR while secreting antibodies, providing a novel and powerful tool to generate human BCR-positive, antibody-secreting B cell lines.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that BCL6 and Bcl-xL, which are expressed in GC B cells and are under control of STAT5 17 synergize to increase the proliferative and survival potential of B cells in vitro. To test this hypothesis we isolated human CD27+ memory B cells from peripheral blood and introduced BCL6 and Bcl-xL into these cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Transduced cells were cultured on irradiated CD40L expressing L cells (CD40L-L cells) in the presence of IL-21, a factor produced by follicular helper T cells in the GC that strongly induces proliferation of B cells 9. The transduced cells were visualized by their expression of the markers \u0394NGFR (BCL6) and GFP (Bcl-xL) (Fig. 1a). Cells expressing both BCL6 and Bcl-xL rapidly increased in frequency to more than 95% of the culture within a two-week period (Fig. 1b). In addition, these cells exhibited a clear expansion advantage compared to cells expressing BCL6 or Bcl-xL alone (Fig. 1c, left panel). When the cell populations were sorted and cultured independently, the BCL6+Bcl-xL transduced cells showed enhanced expansion compared to BCL6 and Bcl-xL-only transduced cells (Fig. 1c, right panel). Normal human B cells rapidly differentiate to antibody-producing plasma cells when cultured on CD40L-L cells in the presence of IL-21 10 which is accompanied by a decrease in expression of surface BCR and MHC class II and an increase in expression of CD38 2. In contrast to non-transduced cells or cells expressing Bcl-xL only in the same culture, BCL6-only and BCL6+Bcl-xL cells both retained BCR expression and were HLA-DRhiCD38int (Fig. 1d) confirming that BCL6 inhibits B cell differentiation 17,18.",

Purified peripheral CD27+ memory B cells from two healthy donors were transduced with BCL6 and Bcl-xL.

RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia among infants and children under 1 year of age and is a serious health problem for elderly people 22. BCL6+Bcl-xL transduced memory B cells of a healthy donor were seeded at 100 cells/well and expanded with CD40L-L cells and IL-21. After 2 weeks of culture, supernatants were harvested and screened for the presence of RSV-neutralizing antibodies in a microneutralization experiment 23. Of 384 cultures (100 cells/well), 31 prevented RSV infection of HEp2 cells. Four microcultures with the highest neutralizing activity were subcloned by limiting dilution. Four monoclonal cell lines (D25, AM14, AM16, and AM23) were selected and further characterized. We observed median half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) against the RSV-A2 virus ranging from 2.1 ng ml\u22121 for D25 and AM14, 4.3 ng ml\u22121 for AM23 to 145 ng ml\u22121 for AM16 (Fig. 4b). By comparison, three of the four Abs exhibited significantly lower IC50 values compared to palivizumab (IC50 209 ng ml\u22121), a humanized, FDA-approved monoclonal antibody that is currently used as prophylaxis in infants at high risk 24.

Several clones expressed levels similar to GC tonsil B cells, whereas others were AICDA low (Fig. 5a). To determine whether AID is functional in the B cell clones, we subcloned the RSV specific monoclonal B-cell line D25 by single cell sorting and analyzed their VH genes for the presence of mutations. Sixty three percent of the wells that were seeded showed robust expansion, suggesting that expression of AID does not result in genetic instability leading to growth arrest and cell death. After 3 weeks culture supernatant of 108 subclones was harvested and the RNA from the cells isolated. Subsequently cDNA was generated and the VH region sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed a total of 184 VH mutations (107 unique mutations), resulting in an estimated mutation rate between 8.85\u00d710\u22125 and 5.14\u00d710\u22125 mutations per bp per cell division, which is at the lower end of the estimated AID-mediated mutation rate in vivo (10\u22123 to 10\u22125) 27. The VH genes of the individual subclones show a variable number of mutations with 65% of subclones harboring one to three mutations in their VH region (of which 23% are silent mutations) and 11% harboring more than three VH mutations. Twenty four percent of the clones had no VH mutations (Fig. 5b). The 372-basepair VH gene of D25 contains 26 AID mutational hotspots (RGYW/WRCY) that account for 30% of the total mutations. Mutations were predominantly observed in the CDR regions and FR3 (Fig 5c).",

We overexpressed the Helix loop Helix factor inhibitor of DNA binding (Id)3 which is known to form transcriptionally inactive complexes with E47, thereby inhibiting AID expression in D25 28. As shown in Figure 5e, overexpression of Id3 strongly reduced AICDA levels in the D25 cell line without influencing proliferation of the D25 cells (data not shown).

This BCR participates in the selection by follicular dendritic cells which occurs in the light zone 5. Moreover, expansion of these B cells is depended upon CD40 signaling and the dark zone is mostly devoid of CD154+ (CD40L) T cells, while these activated T cells are present in the light zone.

Although AID was expressed in all clones that were derived from BCL6+Bcl-xL transduced CD27+ peripheral blood memory cells, the level was variable. Moreover we did not observe isotype switching in these cells over time, indicating that AICDA expression by itself is insufficient to drive this process at least in the time frame and culture conditions we applied. In contrast we did observe the occurrence of somatic hypermutations at relative low frequency in subclones of one RSV-specific B cell clone. Screening of the mAb containing culture supernatant of these subclones on RSV infected cells demonstrated variations in binding capacity. This result suggested that the additional VH gene mutations of some subclones resulted in changes in the antigen-binding affinity. These data raise the possibility that ongoing AID-mediated mutational activity in B cell clones can be used to select higher (or lower) affinity clones obviating the need for deliberate molecular engineering of the relevant Ig genes. It is conceivable that in some cases mutations in the Ig genes of established cloned B cell lines need to be avoided. We show that following introduction of Id3 into B cells that already overexpress BCL6 and Bcl-xL AICDA levels are strongly reduced consistent with findings published by Sayeg et al. 28. Thus overexpression of Id3 should prevent ongoing AID-mediated mutational activity, if a frozen VH/VL repertoire is required. Despite the expression of AICDA in BCL6 and Bcl-xL-transduced IgG, IgM and IgA memory B cells we did not observe CSR in these cells (data not shown). This might be related to the different requirements for AID-mediated SHM and CSR 31,32.",

Both the method described by Traggiai et al. and ours utilize human B cells of exposed individuals to select monoclonal antibodies against a variety of microbes without the need of recent vaccination of the donors. However, in contrast to B cells transformed by EBV 34 all B cell lines obtained with BCL6+Bcl-xL genetic programming stably express high levels of a signaling-competent, membrane-bound BCR. This high level of cell surface BCR facilitates isolation of B cells on the basis of antigen binding which greatly increases the frequency of antigen specific cells and abrogates the need for extensive subcloning. Whereas the generation of antigen specific clones using the EBV method takes 3 months 33, the genetic programming approach reduces this to 1 month. The fact that rare B cells can be easily cloned compares our method favorably with a recently described single cell cloning approach used to isolate influenza-specific antibodies 35. In this study, Ig DNA was isolated 7 days after influenza vaccination from a population of CD27highCD38high B cells which contained a relatively high frequency of only several Influenza virus-specific B cells. The feasibility of this technique depends on a relative high frequency of antigen-specific B cells, that can be obtained by vaccination or very recent exposure to a microbe 35,36. As discussed above expression of AID in the genetically modified clones may be utilized to select antibodies with higher affinity providing an advantage compared to the EBV transformation and single cell PCR methods as platforms to generate human monoclonal antibodies.",
