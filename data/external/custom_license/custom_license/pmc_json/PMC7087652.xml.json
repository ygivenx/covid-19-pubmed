That optimism relied on ignoring signs of impending trouble such as chemical resistance by microbes and their vectors, inadequate antiviral medications, growth of unsanitary megacities, globalized trade and travel of humans and animals, microbially unsafe factory farming and food-processing, and altered human\u2013animal interactions in a rapidly changing landscape. Evidence of the difficulty of controlling infectious diseases through conventional biomedical strategies lies in the long list of human pathogens that have emerged and reemerged in the last three decades: Variant Creutzfeld\u2013Jakob disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus, avian influenza, Marburg virus, Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, plague, dengue, leptospirosis, and West Nile virus, to name a few (Taylor et al., 2001). The fact that these and other diseases have emerged from a wide taxonomic variety of hosts is evidence of the \u201cmetaphenomenon\u201d of a global increase in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs).",

The meeting was designed to facilitate interdisciplinary integration as part of the National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative \u201cResearch Teams of the Future\u201d and was hosted by the East West Centre and the Asia-Pacific Institute of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases. The ideas expressed here reflect the experiences and lessons of a group of scholars with expertise in fields ranging from social science to international development, ecology, and various branches of veterinary and human medicine. The article represents the collective ideas of a working group whose task was to focus on the role of \u201ctransdisciplinary approaches\u201d as a means to integrate knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines; to enhance our understanding of the social and ecological contexts of infectious disease and, ultimately, to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. The meeting themes of interdisciplinary integration and application of a coupled, human\u2013natural systems approach to emerging infectious disease are elaborated further by Lewis (2005) and Wilcox and Colwell (2005).",

In addition to environmental change, social factors such as income inequalities and governance and social power dynamics add another layer of complexity to the task of understanding and responding to emerging infections. Responding to the EID challenges listed in the first paragraph, therefore, demands attention to the interconnections among social and ecological systems at scales ranging from the village to the globe. Accomplishing this will require new forms of knowledge that integrate the natural and human sciences, attend to dynamics at multiple scales\u2014both spatial and temporal\u2014and engage diverse ways of understanding and intervening.",

The metaphor of a ship is used throughout the article to represent new approaches that, while varying in their specifics, share a common recognition that responding effectively to EIDs will require the integration of a wide variety of disciplinary knowledge, as well as the inclusion of knowledge from outside of academia. To extend the metaphor of a ship, the transdisciplinary approaches examined in this article include critical examination of the nature of the deck, who the deck hands are, and where this ship appears to be headed.",

Early pioneers such as Snow, Koch, and Budd knew that social factors had a strong influence on infections; later researchers like Manson, Ross, and Chagas discovered vector-borne diseases, revealing the importance of transmission ecology. Research from these two periods led to the agent-host-environment model of infectious disease, which still serves as the central model for examining emergence of specific diseases. However, this model fails to shed light on the large-scale social and ecological settings in which the metaphenomenon of increased EID emergence is taking place.",

Epidemiology\u2019s main focus became noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, asthma, vascular disease, cancer, substance abuse, and depression. Epidemiologists in the South were particularly critical of this paradigm, on the grounds that it did not explain large-scale influences affecting groups, and that its ethical and theoretical foundations were flawed (Breilh, 1995). In the North, f called for epidemiological research to engage with the \u201cweb of causation\u201d (Krieger, 2004). The debates and theories of the 1990s led to the establishment of ecoepidemiology (group level effects), life-course epidemiology (time sequences, socio-biology and intergenerational effects) and social epidemiology (social causation) (Evans et al., 1994; Commentaries, 1998; Ben-Shloma and Kuh, 2002).",

For instance, in Latin America, unequal distribution and access to resources, as well as institutionalized racism, class, and gender inequalities, were given primacy in theories of disease causation, with emphasis on holistic explanatory accounts of infection based on the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative research methods (Laurell, 1989; Almeida-Filho and Goldbaum, 2004), and the transformative potential of \u201csocial ecosystems\u201d (Breilh, 1991). Elsewhere, scientists studying the \u201cecology of infectious disease\u201d (Real, 1996; Smith et al., 2005) did not necessarily focus on human pathogens but offered biophysical insights with far-reaching implications for epidemiological and biomedical thinking (Wilcox, 2005). As the century ended, calls for integration of social and ecological determinants of health penetrated epidemiology and public health, and ranged from socio\u2013ecologic systems perspective (McMichael, 1999), to a proposal for an \u201cecosocial\u201d approach to health (Krieger, 2001). A convergence of systems-based concepts with health and epidemiological research and policy was finally occurring (Parkes et al., 2003, Table 1), with obvious application in research that responds to the linked social and environmental risk factors of emerging infections (Weiss and McMichael, 2004).",

However, these and other systems-based approaches provide some common principles with which to help understand the nested, interdependent systems in which diseases emerge, maintain themselves, and evolve on a multitude of levels\u2014molecular, organismal, communal, national, and global (Wilcox and Colwell, 2005). Understanding of these \u201cnested hierarchies\u201d is complemented by the idea of coupled human\u2013natural systems, in which humans are both part of nature and fundamentally conditioned by social activity. This recognition, in turn, encourages researchers to incorporate into their methods and research design the idea that \u201cdelineation between social systems and ecosystems is artificial and arbitrary\u201d (Berkes et al., 2003, p 2). Research that explicitly engages with the complexity of systems\u2019 interactions (Kay et al., 1999), and the associated concepts of adaptation and resilience (Holling, 2001), offer valuable precedents and fertile ground for understanding the social, ecological, and economic contexts in which EIDs occur. Yet, despite these developments, systematic formulation, development, and application of approaches that integrate the social and ecological aspects of disease emergence into research paradigms has not yet occurred. The role of transdisciplinary approaches in helping to achieve such an integration is the central theme of this article.",

Approaches to EID control that successfully integrate considerations of participation and equity into their strategies are likely to raise questions about global and local forces driving social and ecological change, and about the needs of those most vulnerable to infectious diseases, in particular women and children (Gerberding, 2004; McDonald et al., 2004), thereby engaging explicitly with the political economy of health (Krieger, 2001).",

In Malaysia, Nipah virus was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host, pigs. In its initial outbreak over a 35-week period, the virus caused a severe febrile encephalitis in 265 patients, of whom 115 died; 93% of the patients worked in the pig-rearing industry (Lam, 2003). Preceding the outbreak in humans was an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory disease in pigs (Mohd Nor, 2000). The virus spread to various regions of Malaysia via movement of infected pigs, then briefly to Singapore. Economic losses in Malaysia were estimated at US $500 million (Lam, 2003).

Though integrated conceptual frameworks and disease control measures founded on complex understandings of social and ecological systems may be informative and grounded, they may not always be feasible or universally desired. A large portion of the mainstream biomedical community is biased against complex social, political, and environmental research on the grounds that such research often depends on more variable, hard-to-measure factors. Those dealing with EID threats will need to remain aware that, while multilayered approaches may produce results that more accurately reflect the uncertainty of real life, such approaches may be challenged on the basis that they often do not lend themselves to straightforward, rapidly-implemented policies or interventions (Ravetz, 2005).",

The successes, and policy relevance, of these approaches will be key to their institutionalization (Lebel, 2004). Additionally, teams and communities of transdisciplinary researchers must communicate their successes and failures so that they are understood by a wide range of audiences and measured by appropriate indices, particularly because holistic systems-based research can take a long time to complete and tends not to make the same splash as large drug or vaccine trials. Substantial outreach and education efforts will be required to achieve these goals, which include communication with, and participation by, those whose health is being studied as well as by decision-makers at multiple levels, from emergency physicians and veterinarians to funding agencies and global policy makers.",

Infectious disease researchers are beginning to follow this lead, informed not only by the positive impact of participatory research on communities, but also by the increased attention to the rights of underrepresented and indigenous communities around the world that is changing the political landscape of donor participation in development, the environment (Chapin, 2004), and health (GFHR, 2004). Innovative research projects that bridge disciplines and engage with place-based knowledge sets of communities vulnerable to EID infection, as well as with nonacademic stakeholders who work with such communities, have great potential not only to increase our capacity to prevent and control emerging infections, but also to meet maturing demands of 21st century funders and donors.",

It is no longer enough for scientists to hone their own corners of research to perfection, and assume someone else (who?) will put it all together. Increased sophistication in efforts to incorporate systems-based concepts regarding ecology, health, and sustainability into professional curricula (Howard, 2004; Howard and Rapport, 2004) is a step in the right direction for a new generation of researchers. We must also find ways to cultivate leadership in the current generation of researchers because it is they who will be required to build the collegial and collaborative platforms from which to bridge disciplines and policy, and make useful contributions in the multistakeholder arena of EID investigation and control. Critical skills will be required to identify how, when, and where disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches will be required in building responses to disease emergence. This is not a small task or an \u201cacademic exercise,\u201d but a necessary step in building our capacity to better respond to the emerging infections of the 21st century.",

However, if we accept that emerging diseases are symptoms of systemic dysfunctions and manifestations of our failure to live sustainably, and if we wish to prevent the occurrence of future epidemics, then reconstructing our views of infection along these lines is our best and brightest hope. As epidemiologist and health historian A.J. McMichael has said, \u201ctrandisciplinarity is more than the mixing and interbreeding of disciplines. Transdisciplinarity transports us: we then ask different questions, we see further, and we perceive the complex world and its problems with new insights.\u201d(McMichael, 2000, p 220). When we are able, by inviting as many hands on deck as we need, to utilize the collective intelligence of society, we will have built a ship that can stay afloat on the rough seas that surely lie ahead of us when it comes to tackling global disease emergence. The laboratory for sustainability is us, and there are no replicates.",

These influences may vary over space and time with implications for both health and development paradigms. A flood may increase vulnerability by disrupting crop cultivation or harvest resulting in loss of income in the short term, but in the long term may replenish the fertile alluvial soil and reduce dependence on external fertilizers. Likewise, in the short term, an irrigation canal may enable dry-season cultivation and enhanced income generation. This may reduce vulnerability through poverty reduction, but also provide new habitats for disease vectors and/or salinization of soils not suitable for dry-season irrigation, thus decreasing crop-yields, and increasing poverty and vulnerability in the long term.
