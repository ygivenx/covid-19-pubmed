            "text": "Momordica charantia L. (MC), a Momordica Linn. genus of the family Cucurbitaceae and commonly known as bitter melon, is a traditional medicine plant indigenous to China.1 The fruit and seed extracts from MC have been used in China for centuries for antivirus, antitumor, and immunopotentiating agent purposes.2 In recent years, several ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), including momordica anti-HIV protein (MAP30) and \u03b1-momorcharin (MMC), \u03b2-MMC, and \u03b3-MMC, a group of which belong to the family of single-chain RIPs, were found to have the ability to inhibit protein biosynthesis in tumor cells by catalytic inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit.3,4 These proteins were also found to be able to inhibit the multiplication of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1),4,5 poliovirus I in Hep2 cells,6 and acquired human immunodeficiency virus type-l (HIV-l).7 However, the strong immunogenicity, allergic reaction, and short half-life of these proteins have been considered the major barriers for their application as therapeutic agents in vivo.8,9 In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus to other technologies. An established technology, polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation (PEGylation), can bestow on proteins several benefits, such as increasing plasma half-life, decreasing toxicity, and reducing immunogenicity and antigenicity.9,10 The Food and Drug Administration has approved the PEGylated forms of the therapeutic proteins such as uricase, erythropoietin, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon, adenosine deaminase, asparaginase, and a growth hormone antagonist. Another technology is nanotechnology, which uses nanomaterials for packing potential therapeutic proteins to extend the half-life period or to make them targeting drugs.",

To overcome these problems, in this study we first purified the two main proteins from bitter melon seeds and carried out their PEGylation using a branched 20 kDa (mPEG)2-Lys-NHS directed specifically to lysil \u025b-amino groups. Homogeneous one-mer, two-mer, and three-mer PEG-RIPs were then identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Not only was their immunogenicity in vivo remarkably decreased but also, importantly, their antitumor and antivirus activities in vitro were moderately influenced when compared with the un-PEGylated counterparts. This work is just the beginning step towards them being used clinically. The application of PEGylation and nanotechnolgy may indicate that the potential application of both \u03b1-MMC and MAP30 can be developed for antitumor and antivirus agents in the future.",

In conclusion, 200 mg of \u03b1-MMC and 120 mg of MAP30 with the recoveries of 1.7% and 1.0%, respectively, was obtained from 200 g starting material seeds. The procedure of purification is summarized in Table 1. Both \u03b1-MMC and MAP30 were assessed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1) and Western blotting (Figure 2). By using the Compute pI/Mw program from ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://www.expasy.org), the theoretical pI of \u03b1-MMC is 9.32 and MAP30 is 8.86. And this is coincident with the result of IEF analyses of these two proteins. ESI-QUAD-MS was used to further identify the two proteins, and sequences were analyzed using the BLAST program (http://www.expasy.org/tools/blast/), which demonstrated that they are \u03b1-MMC (Swiss Prot accession number: P16094, peptides are YLLMHLFNYDGK) and MAP30 (Swiss-Prot accession number: P24817, peptides are ESPPEAYNILFK). MALDI-TOF-MS was used to determine the accurate molecular weight of \u03b1-MMC and MAP30. The results showed that the molecular weights were 28551.6 Da and 29072.0 Da, respectively (Figure 3), while the theoretical molecular weight was 27368.36 Da and 29600.74 Da (http://www.expasy.org).

The CPE of each dilution of HSV-1 cytopathic was tabulated as in Table 2. Measurement of cytotoxicity was designed to establish appropriate dose range for the research of inhibitory effect of proteins on HSV-1 to VERO cells. The result (Figure 9) reflected the effects of different concentrations of test proteins on cell viability of VERO cells and showed that \u03b1-MMC/MAP30, PEG-\u03b1-MMC/MAP30, and ACV had no significant inhibition on VERO cells in the tested concentration range. The cell viability maintained above 97% from 0.003\u20130.03 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121 and 85% from 0.3\u20133.3 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121. Therefore, the dose range of tested proteins inhibiting VERO cell infection with virus was below 3.3 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121. The inhibitory effect of \u03b1-MMC/MAP30, PEGylated \u03b1-MMC/MAP30, and ACV on HSV-1 glycoprotein antigen secretion glycoprotein was tested through the determination of HSV-1 glycoprotein antigen (Table 3). The results showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect. IC50 was 0.67 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121 with \u03b1-MMC, 2.94 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121 with PEG-\u03b1-MMC, 0.47 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121 with MAP30, 2.39 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121 with PEG-MAP30, and 3.55 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121 with ACV, respectively. Furthermore, IC50 of \u03b1-MMC/MAP30 and PEG-\u03b1-MMC/MAP30 was lower than the general drug of ACV. At the same dose, the inhibitory effect on HSV-1 glycoprotein antigen secretion, glycoprotein of MAP30 was higher than that of \u03b1-MMC and PEG-MAP30 was higher than PEG-\u03b1-MMC. The MTT results showed that the ratio of cell viability can be increased on a dose-dependent feature compared with the control group when protein concentration was higher than 0.03 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121. But ACV did not display effects on HSV-1 inactivation. At the same dose, the ratio of cell viability with MAP30 was higher than \u03b1-MMC and PEG-MAP30 was higher than PEG-\u03b1-MMC. This indicated that both \u03b1-MMC/MAP30 and PEG-\u03b1-MMC/MAP30 had the ability of direct HSV-1 inactivation in a certain range of concentration. Additionally, the effect of inactivation was obvious with the increase of protein concentration. VERO cells infected with HSV-1 after 48 hours displayed alterations in the morphology. The inhibitory effect can be observed in groups of \u03b1-MMC/MAP30, PEG-\u03b1-MMC/MAP30, and ACV (Figure 10). The extent of cytopathy was gradually reduced with the increase of the protein concentration. In groups of \u03b1-MMC and MAP30, most cells did not appear cytopathic caused by virus at a concentration of 3.3 \u03bcmol \u00b7 L\u22121. This indicated that proteins played an important role in the inhibition on HSV-1.",

            "text": "A novel preparative strategy of both \u03b1-MMC and MAP30 at one time was successfully established. Some properties of these proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE, ESI-QUAD-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, and N-terminal sequence as well as Western blotting. This fast, highly efficient methodology enables us to focus more energy on subsequent research. A branched (mPEG)2-Lys-NHS(20 kDa) was used to modify these proteins and the serial PEGylated ones were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. The \u03b1-MMC modifier possessed one-mer, two-mer, and three-mer PEG-bound chains, while MAP30 modifier obtained one-mer and two-mer PEG-bound chains. PEGylated conjugates preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and HSV-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%\u201370% antitumor and antivirus activities as well as a 50%\u201370% immunogenicity decrease when compared with unmodified counterparts. To sum up, PEGylation of \u03b1-MMC and MAP30 may offer a possible way for their clinical application as potential therapeutic agents. Nevertheless, to fulfill the requirements of a useful drug, we should meet the challenges, including the reduction of immunogenicity to the greatest extent, the retention of sufficient activity, the extension of the half-life period, and development of various forms of PEG-RIPs. This work is just the beginning for them to be used clinically. After all, therapeutic proteins must fulfill the requirements described previously. PEGylation can reduce immunogenicity and retain certain biological activity of RIPs, but there is lots of work to do for further decreasing their immunogenicity and extending the half-life period. Future work concerns packing RIPs with nanomaterials for targeting drugs and low release.",
