Amplification was carried out in 96-well plates on an iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Thermocycling conditions consisted of 30 min at 48\u00b0C for reverse transcription, 10 min at 95\u00b0C for activation of the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. Each run included one SARS-CoV genomic template control and at least two no-template controls for the extraction (to check for contamination during sample processing) and one no-template control for the PCR-amplification step. As a control for PCR inhibitors, and to monitor nucleic acid extraction efficiency, each sample was tested by real-time RT-PCR for the presence of the human ribonuclease (RNase) P gene (GenBank accesssion number NM_006413) by using the following primers and probe: forward primer 5\u2032-AGATTTGGACCTGCGAGCG-3\u2032; reverse primer 5\u2032-GAGCGGCTGTCTCCACAAGT-3\u2032; probe 5\u2032-TTCTGACCTGAAG GCTCTGCGCG-3\u2032. The assay reaction was performed identically to that described above except that primer concentrations used were 30 \u03bcM each. Fluorescence measurements were taken and the threshold cycle (CT) value for each sample was calculated by determining the point at which fluorescence exceeded a threshold limit set at the mean plus 10 standard deviations above the baseline. Clinical samples were considered positive if two or more of the SARS genomic targets showed positive results (CT \u226445 cycles) and all positive and negative control reactions gave expected values.",

Exogenous nucleic acid had no discernible effect on amplification efficiency of the SARS1 and SARS3 primer/probe sets, as demonstrated by the similarity in linear regression slopes and endpoint detection limits in the presence and absence of specimen extract (Table 3). In contrast, the standard curve for SARS2 had a more efficient slope (\u20133.21) in water than in the presence of spiked extract (\u20133.48) and with greater variation in the CT values at 20 target copies or lower, suggesting that the amplification reaction was less efficient in the presence of the specimen extract.

A potential detection limit of <10 transcript copies was achieved with greater relative sensitivity than cell culture isolation or conventional RT-PCR. The potential for quantitation over a wide dynamic range (at least 6 logs) was demonstrated with low intra- and interassay variability and limited inhibition from exogenous nucleic acid extract from respiratory secretions. The increased sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR assay over cell culture and conventional RT-PCR methods may aid detection of the virus at earlier stages of infection, when the virus is present at low titer in respiratory secretions (8). In addition, by eliminating the need for postamplification product processing, the real-time RT-PCR format permitted shortened turnaround time for reporting results, which proved critical during the SARS outbreak.",

For example, the effectiveness of RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV in clinical specimens has been shown to be greatly influenced by the quantity, type, and timing of specimen collection (8,17). False-negative results due to poor quality nucleic acid or presence of RT-PCR inhibitors can also be a concern. We addressed this by simultaneously testing for the human RNase P gene, which should be present in all adequately collected samples. False-negative results could also potentially arise from mutations occurring in the primer and probe target regions in the SARS-CoV genome. We addressed this by including multiple genetic targets in our assay and by carefully comparing our primer and probe sequences against published sequences of SARS-CoV as they became available. To avoid false-positive results, meticulous care was taken to prevent introduction of contaminating viral RNA or previously amplified DNA during preparation of the nucleic acid extracts and amplification reactions. In addition, all RT-PCR\u2013positive specimens were retested from a second, unopened sample aliquot and confirmed in a second laboratory by using a real-time assay based on different genetic targets.",
