High HL18NL11 concentrations in intestinal specimens are consistent with qualitative data from the pioneering study on HL18NL11 (5) and may suggest intestinal tropism and potential fecal shedding into the environment.",

MH682200\u201315) (Appendix Table 1). The 2 HL18NL11 variants in Brazil differed by 15 nt from each other across the combined 8 genomic segments. Four of those substitutions were nonsynonymous, causing amino acid exchanges in the PB2 (V203I), PB1 (R334K), nucleoprotein (G484S), and NA (V191I) genes (Table 2; Figure 1, panel B). This finding suggests recent common ancestry of the HL18NL11 variants identified in the 2 positive bats and was consistent with their detection in the same site 5 days apart. Comparison of the full coding sequence of the novel HL18NL11 variants revealed high sequence identity between the Peru and the Brazil strains, 93.5%\u201396.9% nucleotide identity across all 8 genomic segments (Table 2). The genomic relatedness of Peru and Brazil HL18NL11 strains was surprising given a time span of 2 years, a geographic distance exceeding 2,000 km, and 2 different bat species that tested positive in our study and the previous study (5).",

Thermodynamic modeling revealed that the amino acid exchanges observed between the Brazil and Peru HL18NL11 strains did not alter the tridimensional structure of the HL and NL proteins, and neither mapped to the putative receptor binding site of the HL protein (Figure 1, panel C), nor to the putative active site of the NL protein (Figure 1, panel D) (6). This result suggests preservation of the biologic activity of these glycoproteins in different bat species and supported a broadly conserved cellular receptor of bat influenza A viruses that differs from sialic acid receptors used by avian-associated influenza A viruses (10). Significantly fewer amino acid exchanges were observed between the HL proteins of Brazil and Peru bat influenza virus than between the respective NL proteins (p = 0.007 by Fisher exact test) (Table 2). The apparently low rate of nonsynonymous substitutions in the HL-encoding genes of bat influenza A virus variants was reminiscent of strong purifying selection acting on the hemagglutinin genes in avian-specific influenza A virus strains (11). This finding may suggest comparable evolutionary dynamics between chiropteran and avian reservoirs. Definite assessments will require considerably larger datasets of bat influenza A virus strains.",

The distribution of these bat species overlaps (Figure 1, panel A), potentially facilitating virus exchange across the populations. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the close genetic relationship between Peru and Brazil HL18NL11 variants across all 8 segments (Figure 2; Appendix Table 2), suggesting lack of reassortment events according to the available data. Our data thus suggest host associations of HL18NL11 beyond the species level, comparable to genus-level host associations of other batborne RNA viruses such as coronaviruses (13).",

The abundance of A. lituratus bats within Latin America (Figure 1, panel A) may thus facilitate spillover infections into other vertebrates across an underrecognized geographic and host range. Finally, Artibeus spp. bats have been used previously for infection studies including viruses with evolutionary origins in bats, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (15). The relatively large body size of A. lituratus bats (\u224865 g) and ease of keeping these bats under laboratory conditions may thus facilitate experimental infection studies for HL18NL11 to elucidate the exact sites of HL18NL11 replication, receptor usage, and mode of transmission.",
