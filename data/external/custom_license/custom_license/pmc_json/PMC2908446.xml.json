Nucleic acid was extracted using a kit (High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit; Roche Diagnostics Corp., Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedures. Then PCR/reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using previously described methods with slight modifications [1, 3, 4, 9, 22, 24]. Briefly, for the RNA viruses, a superscript one-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for reverse-transcription and first-round PCR with virus specific primers under the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For DNA viruses and also nested PCR, Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) was used along with the manufacturer\u2019s supplied buffer under the appropriate thermal cycle conditions for each primer. Each sample was examined for RSV, rhinovirus (RV), hMPV, HBoV, adenovirus (AdV), and parainfluenzavirus (PIV). Following amplification, PCR products were separated on the 1.5% agarose gel with Tris\u2013boric acid\u2013EDTA buffer and visualized with SYBR-green (Cambrex Corp., Rockland, ME, USA) under a UV transilluminator. The PCR products were purified; their nucleic acid sequences were determined to confirm PCR results. Nucleotide sequences were processed using software (GENETYX) and compared to nucleotide sequences of the DNA database using a BLAST system [20].",

In our study, oxygen saturation on admission shows that hypoxia was more severe in HBoV-positive patients than in RSV-positive patients. Moreover, the short duration from disease onset to admission shows that respiratory distress and hypoxia progress rapidly in HBoV-positive patients. Oikawa et al. recently reported a severe case with HBoV associated with plastic bronchitis, which necessitated mechanical ventilation [21]. Many previous reports have not described severe cases of HBoV infection; however, the sample size is small and the studies were retrospective. In our study, one out of 18 patients had severe pneumonia and remained hospitalized for 19 days. A larger number of cases with HBoV-positive LRTI must be accumulated to discuss the disease severity. Patients with RSV infection sometimes need intensive care. Pediatricians have specifically addressed the care and protection of this infection. One reason is that the RSV infection is frequently found in infants who are younger than 3 months. Furthermore, patients younger than 3 months often require intensive care. In contrast, the minimum age of HBoV-positive patient is 5 months in our study. Therefore, the difference in the age of patients might affect the disease severity.",

This parameter might strongly support clinical diagnosis of LRTI with HBoV. Acute hypoxia induces a differential response in peripheral blood neutrophils and lymphocytes, resulting in neutrophilia and lymphopenia [27].
