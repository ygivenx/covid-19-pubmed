Very often we find that some epitopes seem to be dominant and the strong response towards them may be at the expense of being able to respond to other epitopes of the pathogen. One thing that is certain is that the most dominant epitopes do not necessarily correspond to the most effective neutralizing ones. In fact, natural selection pressure tends to drive occlusion of the most neutralizing epitopes of the pathogen. The pathogen gains a selective advantage when it is able to obscure its \u2018weak points\u2019 and distract the host\u2019s immune system by devising \u2018seductive\u2019 epitopes with little protective value. This can be achieved by creating\u2018baits\u2019 of sorts that are particularly surface-accessible and hydrophilic, yet amenable to constant genetic variation. For example, the five variable loops of HIV-1 gp120 are highly immunogenic but, because of their ever changing nature, allow the swarm of HIV to evade immune surveillance by constantly mutating out of the binding capacity of the antibodies produced after first encounters.[13\u201315]",

It is envisaged that epitopes would be selected for their ability to elicit potent neutralization rather than their natural surface accessibility. Such epitopes are most likely to correspond to conserved aspects of the pathogen that cannot tolerate modification and through natural selection have evolved to be less immunogenic. For example, those aspects of HIV-1 gp120 that must function in receptor recognition are required to correspond to the invariant structures of the host (e.g. CD4 and CCR5[16]). These same epitopes are buried in gp120 and, as a result, are comparatively less immunogenic, leading to the production of relatively few antibodies against them in the natural progression of disease.[15] By isolating these epitopes and presenting them out of context, i.e. immunizing with them in the absence of the rest of the virus, one should gain a desired effect of enhancing their immunogenicity. Producing epitope-based vaccines derived from the most conserved aspects of the viral antigens would not only promise a more focused, and hopefully more functional, protective immunity but also a more efficient immune response towards them.",

            "text": "The second danger in mounting antibodies against pathogens stems from the possibility of epitope mimetics of native host proteins. The development of autoimmunity has been connected with viral infections,[6,7] the idea being that in the event of a foreign antigen having structural similarities to native host proteins, mounting antibodies towards these similar structures may lead to cross-reactive binding of the antibodies with the auto-antigens leading to pathological autoimmunity; note, that in this case cross-reactivity is detrimental as compared with the desirable effects described previously. A case in point has recently been described for the vaccines developed against Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent causing Lyme disease). The outer surface protein A (OspA) of the bacterium contains a short sequence of nine amino acids, which is homologous to the human leukocyte function associated antigen-1 (hLFA-1). As a result, the Lyme vaccine, based on recombinant OspA, has been postulated to induce an autoimmune reaction to the auto-antigen, resulting in arthritic symptoms. Targeted deletion of the nonapeptide epitope from the OspA has been proposed as a solution to this problem.[20\u201322] Obviously, in developing epitope-based vaccines one would be able to rationally design the epitope cocktail to exclude epitopes that could be associated with auto-antigens.",

We recognize that even short linear peptides can greatly depend on their three dimensional conformation for bioactivity. Thus, for example, we do not presume that short peptide hormones or neurotransmitters, such as leu- or met-enkephalin (5 residues),[24] angiotensin II (8 residues)[25] or substance P (11 residues)[26] are exempt from specific conformational requirements for their physiological function.",

This is by no means an easy task. The final reconstituted epitope could either be based on the actual antigen segments tacked onto and supported by some scaffold of sorts or, alternatively, may functionally be similar to the epitope but structurally an unrelated mimetic. In this instance it is presumed that functional moieties of the epitope are effectively situated in space using alternative residues or chemistries to recreate a landscape similar to that of the epitope but not using the same composition. Finally, a simpler yet less comprehensive approach would be to attempt to reconstitute only partial structural elements of the epitope. For example, if an epitope is comprised of a series of anti-parallel \u03b2 strands forming a number of juxtaposed \u03b2 hairpins, one might consider attempting to reconstruct each \u03b2 hairpin separately instead of trying to encompass the epitope in its entirety.",

Discovery of the segment can be accomplished by screening the mAb against a \u2018Geysen pepscan\u2019. In 1984 Mario Geysen introduced the idea of generating a series of overlapping linear peptides that cover the entirety of the antigen being studied.[27] In such a case, the array of peptides is reacted with the antibody and those segments that continue to bind represent a significant aspect of the epitope. This linear peptide can then be tested for its capacity to elicit the desired effect when used as a peptide immunogen.[23] Such pepscans can also indicate components of discontinuous epitopes in the event that two distant peptides each contain sufficient structural elements that allow them to bind the mAb separately.

In these systems, highly purified antigen and corresponding antibody are allowed to co-crystallize to form an antigen:antibody complex. The crystals are then interrogated with x-rays and due to the highly structured repeated nature of the crystal unit, diffraction patterns are generated. These can then be related by the Fourier transform to the 3-dimensional coordinates of the electron densities of the amino acids composing the antigen and its bound antibody. The epitope is in essence the antigen component of the antigen:an-tibody interface.

One approach is to limit the scope of the problem of epitope mapping by testing the ability of the antibody to continue to bind to fragments of the antigen. Thus, binding assays such as ELISA, dot blot, or western blot assays can provide insights as to the location of the epitope within the gross anatomy of the antigen. For example, the epitope of the CD4-specific mAb OKT4A can be localized to the first 86 residues of CD4, as cleavage of the antigen into fragments or expression of truncated versions of the antigen illustrate that the first, D1, domain of the antigen binds the antibody.[18] Similarly, systematic biochemical analyses and enzymatic degradation of the \u03b1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,[45] use of synthetic peptides,[46,47] and expression of fusion proteins,[48,49] were able to localize the ligand binding site to a segment of the \u03b1 subunit of the receptor that contained <50 amino acid residues. In principle, so long as one can generate fragments that continue to bind, one can attempt to identify the smallest segment of the receptor or antigen that continues to be recognized. Thus, binding per se serves as an extremely effective monitor for the presence of functional aspects of the epitope. Exploiting this operational definition of the epitope, as a segment that continues to bind the antibody, a number of experimental strategies have been employed to map epitopes.",

Here 32 residues of the RBD were subjected to ASM,[53] and of these, six were found to be components of the actual binding surface as ultimately determined by co-crystallization. A total of 11 of the 32 exchanges indeed had a dramatic effect on RBD binding to ACE2. Surprisingly, however, only three of these were actual contact residues (3 of the 6 mentioned above). Thus, modification of the other three residues of the binding site had no impact on binding at all. Moreover, the remaining eight mutations that had a profound inhibitory effect on binding were in fact situated outside of the boundaries of the binding surface. This goes to illustrate that mutations of residues outside the bona fide epitope can result in loss of binding, possibly implying their importance for the structural integrity of the functional epitope rather than a role as a contact residue per se.[53,54] With no structural information available, such residues would mistakenly be assigned to the binding epitope. Alternatively, as in the case of the S ARS RBD-ACE2 interface, mutation of bona fide contact residues to alanine does not necessarily interfere with binding.[54\u201356]",

Alternatively, mutating the critical contact residue Asp-18 to Ala, resulting in the loss of one hydrogen bond and seven van der Waals contacts with the antibody, has no impact on binding at all. This can be explained by the fact that three water molecules fill the void created by the substitution of Asp-18 for Ala and, therefore, compensate for the lack of the functional Asp moiety, and allow binding activity to persist. This indicates that only a few of the many residues which comprise an epitope are absolutely critical for interaction, providing essential contacts required for antibody recognition. As a result, in the absence of a co-crystal, contact residues that are tolerant to mutations would not be included in the predicted epitope.",

The mutagenesis was directed by structural information on the epitope recognized by a competing antibody. Of the mutants constructed, eight resulted in significant reduction of antibody binding. Subsequently, when the crystal structure of gp120-X5 Fab-CD4 was solved,[58] it became apparent that of the 55 substitutions made, only 6 residues fell within the genuine binding epitope. Nonetheless, of these six alanine mutations, four had no effect on binding and had not been predicted as part of the epitope, whereas two mutations did impair binding significantly.

One method for the production of peptides with a limited number of mutations per molecule is \u2018biased random mutagenesis\u2019.[59\u201363] In this technique, corresponding oligonucleotides are synthesized using phosphoramidite monomer precursors contaminated with regulated amounts of the other three nucleotide precursors. The degree of contaminating phosphoramidites needed to achieve the desirable mutation frequency per peptide can be calculated using an algorithm described by Ophir and Gershoni.[63] Random mutations can also be achieved using chemical reagents such as sodium bisulfite,[64] hydroxylamine,[65] and nitrous acid.[66] These reagents induce structural modifications of specific bases in the DNA sequence, resulting in an alternative base pairing and, thus, changing the DNA sequence.[67,68] Additionally, chemical reagents such as formic acid[69,70] and hydrazine[71] are capable of damaging DNA bases, thus preventing Watson-Crick pairing and ultimately causing mis-incorporation of a nucleotide.[68] Error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used as a mutagenesis technique and is implemented by using a low-fidelity DNA polymerase that efficiently introduces random mutations along the amplified sequence.[72]",

Moreover, loss of binding is often the result of modification of residues that lie outside of the epitope. For instance, the degree of success of random mutagenesis as a means to predict epitopes was determined in the study of the crystal structure of histidine phospho-carrier protein (HPr)-Jel42 mAb complex.[73,74] Among the 34 random mutations made to the surface of HPr, 12 were contact residues as defined by the co-crystal. Thirteen of the 34 mutations resulted in reduction of Jel42 mAb binding. Of these, nine residues lay within the genuine binding epitope. However, the remaining four inhibitory mutations were of residues totally removed from the binding interface. Furthermore, mutations of three bona fide contact residues had virtually no effect on Jel42 binding, once again indicating that substitutions of epitope-residues can often be accommodated.",

For example, a peptide of the sequence ABCDE\u2026 would be written as the series of pairs, AB BC CD DE, etc. All AAPs derived from a panel of peptides are then pooled and the frequency of each type is calculated and determined whether its representation in the pool is higher than its random expectation (based on the theoretical amino acid frequencies of the phage library). The most significant AAPs are considered as statistically significant pairs (SSPs). Thus, each peptide is assumed to contain one or more epitope-relevant AAPs, which are the basis for mAb recognition of that peptide.",

The use of epitope-based vaccines, although not yet implemented commercially, should prove to be effective and in some cases obviate problems that exist in the more traditional vaccine paradigms. Hence, the first real challenge in developing an epitope-based vaccine is to be able to identify the epitope of interest with reasonable precision. Undoubtedly, the most effective means for this is through the physical x-ray analysis of the antigen:antibody co-crystal. However, this is often not easily achievable. The other empirical approaches described above are certainly more readily accessible, yet each has its advantages and disadvantages.",
