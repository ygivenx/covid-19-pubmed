Primers were designed to amplify the PEDV M gene and yielded the amplified product of 715 bp on the basis of CV777 and Br1/87.

They were responsible for the recent PED outbreak in Thailand and able to produce pathologic effects similar to the Chinese isolates (6). Notably, 08NP04, isolated 4 months after the first outbreak, had the highest identity to JS-2004-2. Also, 08NP04 and 07NP01 (the first isolates in 2007) originated in the same geographic area. The Chinese-like strain of the virus might have gained entry into Thailand via unknown routes as early as December 2007. In addition, rendering trucks traveling from farm to farm might have encouraged widespread transmission of the disease. Structural differences in the partial S gene could help elucidate pathogenesis and antigenic structures of the recent PEDV isolates because S glycoproteins are responsible for inducing the virus neutralizing antibodies and known to be highly conserved in PEDV strains (7). Continuing investigation of PEDV isolates will contribute to the prevention and control of this virus.",

Despite precautions, sporadic outbreaks continue to occur. In addition, disease transmission frequently occurs due to the purchase of new stock with improper gilt acclimatization and biosecurity. Immunity induced through vaccination, currently unavailable in Thailand, does not provide lifelong protection from this virus. However, vaccination is recommended to encourage specific immunity to PEDV in all stock when an acute outbreak occurs. Undoubtedly, effective biosecurity is a key management tool for PED prevention and control. Our data suggested that all recent Thai PEDV isolates are genetically similar to the Chinese isolates identified in 2004. Further analysis of the entire S gene of PEDV and of other isolates in neighboring countries is needed to show the molecular epidemiology of the Chinese-like strain.",
