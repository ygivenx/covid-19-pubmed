In brief, the categories are persons with community-acquired pneumonia (category I); healthcare-associated pneumonia (II); symptoms after exposure to a MERS-CoV case-patient (III); or unexplained febrile illness (IV). The case definition was revised in May 2014 (7); additional refinements were made in June 2015 (8). The 2015 definition included changes to the approach for testing children <14 years of age with nonsevere illness (testing is reserved for children with exposure to camels or camel products or to a confirmed or suspected MERS case-patient). In addition to suspected cases, testing is recommended for close contacts of persons with confirmed MERS-CoV infection, regardless of symptoms, and can also be requested at the discretion of an infectious disease consultant. Tests are performed on respiratory specimens at 5 regional laboratories using real-time PCR (9).",

When a suspected case-patient is identified for testing, the referring hospital reports demographic and basic clinical data to HESN (Figure 1). After specimens are submitted and testing completed, the regional laboratory reports the result to HESN. For positive cases, the referring hospital submits additional clinical information, and the local Health Affairs Directorate (HAD) initiates an investigation of exposures and contacts. For negative test results, no further action is taken in HESN. Surveillance activities occur in each of the 20 local HADs and among Hajj pilgrims. We analyzed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for persons reported to HESN during April 1, 2015\u2013February 1, 2016, in aggregate and by HAD using Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",
