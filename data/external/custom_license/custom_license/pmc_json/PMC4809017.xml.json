            "text": "Oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) are members of the interferon pathway which plays an important role in innate antiviral defense (Goodbourn et al. 2000; Hovanessian 2007; Rebouillat and Hovanessian 1999). Upon infection with a viral pathogen, OAS enzymes are upregulated by interferon and act as viral sensors of infection in the cytosol by binding to, and being activated by, viral dsRNA. Upon activation, OAS enzymes synthesize 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates using ATP and newly synthesized oligoadenylates as substrates. These oligoadenylates trigger the dimerization and activation of RNase L, which acts as an indiscriminate RNase, targeting both viral and cellular RNA for degradation, thus stopping protein synthesis and viral replication. In primates, the OAS gene family consists of three active members containing one (OAS1), two (OAS2), or three (OAS3) homologous domains (Justesen et al. 2000; Kumar et al. 2000). OAS1 has been shown to participate in the first line of defense against a wide range of viral infection including encephalomyocarditis virus, coxsackievirus B4, respiratory syncytial virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV-1 (Silverman 2007). Association studies have determined that variation at OAS1 correlates with disease severity of or susceptibility to several viral infections of great public health significance such as hepatitis C virus (Knapp et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2013), SARS coronavirus (Hamano et al. 2005; He et al. 2006), West Nile virus (Bigham et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2009), and coxsackievirus A16 (Cai et al. 2014).",

            "text": "The crystal structure of the OAS1 protein has recently been solved (Donovan et al. 2013; Hartmann et al. 2003). OAS1 is a globular protein composed of two large lobes (N- and C-lobes) connected by a linker region. In between the two lobes lies the active site within a deep electronegative channel. On the directly opposite side of the enzyme lies a positively charged groove, the RNA-binding domain (RBD). Upon binding an RNA ligand, OAS1 undergoes a conformational change resulting in the activation of the enzyme (Donovan et al. 2013). Since OAS1 requires direct interaction with viral dsRNA for activation, it is likely that the evolution of this enzyme is affected by the evolution of viral pathogens or by the viral diversity to which an organism is exposed. Indeed, evolutionary analyses in rodents, primates, and bats strongly suggest that the evolution of the OAS1 protein is driven by host-pathogen interactions (Ferguson et al. 2008, 2012; Mozzi et al. 2015). In chimpanzees, for instance, OAS1 is extraordinarily variable and it was shown that OAS1 haplogroups predate the origin of hominoids (Ferguson et al. 2012). The retention of ancestral polymorphisms over such a long period of time is highly unusual and strongly suggests that OAS1 has evolved under balancing selection, a type of natural selection that maintains allelic variation in populations. In human, on the other hand, Mendez et al. (2012, 2013) failed to detect the signature of balancing selection, yet they made a very interesting observation: they showed that some contemporary human populations had acquired and retained OAS1 alleles of Neanderthal or Denisovan origin. However, it remains unknown if the persistence of these OAS1 alleles in modern human is adaptive, possibly conferring some advantage to the individuals carrying these alleles, or if this polymorphism is neutral.",

Here, we analyze the diversity of OAS1 in baboons (g. Papio) and macaques (g. Macaca), two primate genera that have long served as models in infectious disease research (Misra et al. 2013; Palermo et al. 2013; Valdes et al. 2013; Wolf et al. 2006). We show that OAS1 harbors a very low diversity in baboons but a remarkably high variability in macaques, suggestive of the action of balancing selection. We demonstrate that balancing selection is principally acting on sites of the RNA-binding domain. Using in silico models of the OAS1 alloforms, we further show that these balanced polymorphisms are likely to affect the RNA-binding properties of the enzyme.",

Under neutrality, this ratio should be the same across the genome but an excess of polymorphism relative to divergence at a specific locus could be interpreted as evidence for balancing selection while a deficit of polymorphism would indicate positive directional selection. Statistical significance is assessed using a X\n2 goodness-of-fit test. As neutral regions of reference for the rhesus macaque, we used 30 randomly chosen loci that had previously been sequenced in 38 Indian and 9 Chinese unrelated individuals (Hernandez et al. 2007). For the cynomolgus macaque, we used 26 non-coding regions that were sequenced in 24 individuals from three Southeast Asian populations (Osada et al. 2010). For the two baboon species, we used the 12 neutral regions analyzed in Boissinot et al. (2014). As out-groups, we used human and gorilla homologous sequences. The multi-locus HKA test was performed using Jody Hey\u2019s HKA software (available at https://bio.cst.temple.edu/\u223chey/software/software.htm#HKA) or Sebas Ramos-Onsins HKAdirect software (http://bioinformatics.cragenomica.es/numgenomics/people/sebas/index.html).",

Considering the level of conservation of OAS1 between monkeys and humans at the amino acid level, it seems justified to use the solved structure of human OAS1 (PDB ID: 4IG8) to confidently model and annotate residues in the old world monkeys. Though taxonomically distant, we also found it valuable to use the porcine OAS1 (pOAS1) crystal structure (PDB ID: 1PX5), as it shares the overall structural fold (73 % pairwise, 86 % BLOSUM64 identity) and provides a template for modeling OAS1 without bound RNA.

The amount of polymorphism is correlated to the level of between-species divergence under neutrality, and this should be true for both replacement and silent sites. Thus, we compared the level of polymorphism at replacement and silent sites with the fraction of replacement and silent sites that are fixed between each of our focal species and an out-group. To this end, we calculated the parameter NI, which is predicted to be higher than 1 if balancing selection is acting at a locus (Table 1). Using human or gorilla as an out-group, we obtained values that were well above 1 for both macaque species (1.6 to 1.9 for cynomolgus and 1.4 to 1.7 for rhesus), although we were not able to statistically exclude neutrality using the MK test (P = 0.16 to 0.37 for cynomolgus and P = 0.30 to 0.56 for rhesus). By comparison, the NI values for the olive baboon ranged from 0.75 to 0.89 (P = 1.0).",

We ran linkage disequilibrium analysis using DnaSP in order to test linkage between polymorphisms. Pooling all macaque sequences, linkage was found (P < 0.001) between 77 pairs of polymorphic sites. Nearly all linkage was found to be between physically close sites (located in the same exon).

The surface electrostatics shows a significant effect of this polymorphism since R54 yields a broad electropositive surface to the protein while cysteine has a neutral effect. In addition, replacements at sites 52 and 54 may have an effect on residue S56, which binds directly to RNA nucleobase G17. The role of G17 is noteworthy because point mutation of G17 has been shown to decrease OAS1 activation 30-fold (Donovan et al. 2013).

In addition, selective sweeps of favorable alleles or drastic reductions in population size can erase the signature of balancing selection; thus, balanced polymorphisms are predicted to be transient, and long-term balancing selection exceedingly rare (Charlesworth 2006). Yet, recent studies in human have emphasized the importance of balancing selection as an efficient mechanism to maintain variation in populations (reviewed in Key et al. 2014), particularly at immunity genes. The most famous and best documented example of balancing selection concerns genes of the MHC system where alleles have been maintained in populations for millions of years, resulting in trans-specific polymorphisms (Klein et al. 1993; Lawlor et al. 1988; Mayer et al. 1988). In recent years, candidate gene analyses as well as genome-wide searches have identified additional loci that have evolved under balancing selection, including the ABO blood group (Leffler et al. 2013), the anti-retroviral TRIM5 gene (Cagliani et al. 2010), and the CCR5 gene (Bamshad et al. 2002). It has even been proposed that balancing selection is the main evolutionary force acting on innate immunity genes (Ferrer-Admetlla et al. 2008), a category of genes OAS1 belongs to.",

Comparable to what we find in macaques, chimpanzee OAS1 contains an extremely high level of polymorphism that far exceeds the genomic average as well as an excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms. Furthermore, a number of polymorphic sites appeared to fall conspicuously in the RBD (Ferguson et al. 2012). In order to see if any of the replacement sites in macaque were shared with chimpanzee, we aligned the primary protein sequences as well as the structural models. The two main groups of alleles in chimpanzee differ by 15 polymorphic amino acids. Seven of these sites (28, 54, 96, 128, 163, 244, and 337) are also polymorphic in macaque. Surprisingly, six of these residues are polymorphic for exactly the same amino acids, including three RBD sites (28, 54, and 163), two of which (28 and 54) were identified as selected sites by Mozzi et al. (2015). Another five polymorphic amino acids in macaque immediately neighbor residues that are polymorphic in chimpanzee. The similarity between macaque and chimpanzee is demonstrated on Fig. 6, which shows RBD polymorphisms side by side. The similarity between these two primate taxa is striking and could suggest that these polymorphisms have been maintained by long-term balancing selection since macaque and chimpanzee split. This is however very unlikely since macaque and chimpanzee otherwise differ by 15 fixed amino acids and phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that chimpanzee and macaque alleles are reciprocally monophyletic (not shown). Instead, the similarity between chimpanzees and macaques represent an interesting case of convergent polymorphism.\n",

First, we did not detect in macaque an excess of intermediate frequency alleles that would have yielded positive values of Tajima\u2019s D, whereas such an excess of intermediate frequency alleles was found in chimpanzee, resulting in positive and significant values of Tajima\u2019s D. Second, we did not find evidence for linkage disequilibrium in macaque whereas very strong linkage, suggestive of epistatic interactions, was found in chimpanzee between mutations in exons 1, 3, and 4. Although differences in recombination rate could account for this pattern, it is more likely to reflect a difference in the age of the balanced polymorphism. Multi-locus selection takes a long time to generate linkage disequilibrium (Hedrick 2010), and Tajima\u2019s D fails to detect balancing selection if selection is too recent (Garrigan and Hedrick 2003). Thus, it is most likely that balancing selection has not acted on OAS1 polymorphisms in macaque as long as it has in chimpanzee.",

            "text": "Since balancing selection has played such a significant role in the evolution of OAS1, it is somewhat surprising that we did not find any evidence for it in baboons. Two processes could have erased the signature of balancing selection in these species. First, a diversity-reducing demographic event, such as a population bottleneck, could have eliminated allelic diversity at OAS1. This is a possibility for the Guinea baboon, a species characterized by a remarkably low level of genetic variation (Boissinot et al. 2014). It is however very unlikely to be the case in olive baboons since this form has maintained a relatively large effective population size for most of its history (Boissinot et al. 2014). Second, a selective sweep resulting in the fixation of a highly favorable allele could have occurred in the ancestor of baboons. When compared to macaque, there are only three derived mutations that are fixed or nearly fixed in baboons at residues T24R, H25R, and Y51S. Residues 24 and 25 belong to the \u03b1-helix N3, which participates in the RBD, and residue 24 was shown to interact directly with the RNA ligand (Donovan et al. 2013). The fixation of a positively charged arginine in place of an uncharged threonine is undoubtedly a highly significant change that could have affected drastically the RNA-binding affinity of the baboon OAS1. Interestingly, residue 24 is polymorphic in chimpanzee (T/K) (Ferguson et al. 2012) and was identified as a site under positive selection in this species (Mozzi et al. 2015). The replacement at residue 25 is unlikely to have much effect since the sidegroup ostensibly orients away from the RBD and a mutation from arginine to histidine is a conservative change. The change from the hydrophobic tyrosine to the uncharged serine at position 51 could also have a functional impact due to its proximity to a group of six residues (residues 54 to 60) that bind directly to the RNA ligand. We speculate that an episode of positive directional selection acting on one of these three sites (or on a combination of them) could have erased the signature of balancing selection in baboons. This hypothesis will however require experimental validation.",

Whatever the exact mechanism, the persistence of amino acid polymorphisms, in particular at the RBD, strongly suggests that OAS1 alleles differ in their RNA-binding activity, most likely to achieve optimal recognition of specific viral RNAs. The RNA-binding specificity of OAS1 implied by our evolutionary analysis is not consistent with early molecular studies, which suggested that OAS1 is a non-specific sensor of viral infection, and with the involvement of the OAS1/RNase L pathway against a wide diversity of viral infection (Silverman 2007). More recent studies however have shown differential binding and activation of OAS1 based on RNA sequence, RNA secondary structure, or presence of 3\u2032 single-stranded pyrimidine motifs (Deo et al. 2014; Hartmann et al. 1998; Kodym et al. 2009; Vachon et al. 2015). The dsRNA consensus sequences NNWW(N)nWGN (Kodym et al. 2009), AYAY(N)nCC, and UU(N)nACCC (Hartmann et al. 1998) have been identified experimentally, and it was shown that single or double SNPs in RNA ligands could alter OAS1 activation by degrees of magnitude. This is compelling evidence that minor changes to RNA sequences or to the RBD can profoundly affect OAS1\u2019s antiviral response. It is thus plausible that the polymorphisms we identified can confer some level of specificity to different viral species. The present analysis, together with previous studies in chimpanzees and other mammals (Ferguson et al. 2012; Mozzi et al. 2015), provides a collection of candidate amino acids for future functional studies aimed at determining the molecular basis of the binding specificity of OAS1.",
