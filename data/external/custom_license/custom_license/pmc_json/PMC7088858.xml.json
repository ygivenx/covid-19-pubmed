Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) in children is diagnosed clinically by symptoms and temporal course, most often in relation to an upper respiratory viral infection.

In a study evaluating the relationship between symptoms of acute respiratory infections and objective changes within the sinuses utilizing MRI scans, 60 children (mean age = 5.7 year) who had symptoms for an average of 6 days before scanning were investigated [5]. Close to 60 % of the children had abnormalities in their maxillary and ethmoid sinuses, 35 % in the sphenoid sinuses, and 18 % in the frontal sinuses. A follow-up MRI scan taken 2 weeks later in 26 of the above children with major abnormalities on initial MRI showed a significant reduction in the extent of abnormalities irrespective of resolution of clinical symptoms.

This is usually accomplished using the largest speculum of an otoscope or, alternatively, a head light and nasal speculum. Topical decongestion may be used to improve visualization. Nasal endoscopy provides for superior visualization of the middle meatus, adenoid bed, and nasopharynx, and is strongly recommended in children who are able to tolerate it. An oral cavity exam may uncover purulent postnasal drainage, cobblestoning of the posterior pharyngeal wall, or tonsillar hypertrophy.",

While a maxillary sinus tap will provide the most accurate and reliable results, it is a relatively invasive procedure and is difficult to perform in a child in the office. Alternatively, obtaining cultures from the middle meatus under endoscopic visualization has shown promise in correlating with antral cultures. In children, data regarding the usefulness of this approach are limited and are mostly based on studies in CRS, which is beyond the scope of this review.",

            "text": "ARS is a disorder that involves inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa. The pathophysiology of ARS is multifactorial and involves the interaction between a viral infection, a predisposing condition, and a subsequent inflammatory response in the mucosal lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Viruses account for up to 90 % of the causative agents of ARS and include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and RSV [10]. Through various mechanisms\u2014such as epithelial damage and cytokine upregulation\u2014viruses activate inflammatory pathways and the parasympathetic nervous system to generate the symptoms of ARS [10]. The inflammatory process leads to edema, engorgement, fluid extravasation, mucus production, and obstruction of the sinus ostium. The ostiomeatal complex (OMC) is the critical anatomic structure in rhinosinusitis in adults and children and is entirely present, though not at full size, in newborns. Mucociliary transport usually moves mucus towards the natural ostia of the sinuses and then into the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx. This motion can be affected and interrupted by mucociliary dysfunction or mucosal inflammation. Ostial obstruction impedes normal ventilation and drainage of the sinuses, which can lead to bacterial infection and ABRS. Conditions that can predispose to, and exacerbate, an inflammatory response include rhinitis (allergic and nonallergic), anatomic variants (septal deviation), coexisting medical conditions (cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency, pregnancy, chronic rhinosinusitis with/without nasal polyps), and environmental factors (smoking, daycare) [11].",

The most frequently isolated organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [12]. Several studies since then have duplicated these findings and have also shown that the most common organisms responsible for ABRS in children are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and anaerobes [2]. Due to technical constraints, recent estimates of the microbiology of ABRS are based on that of acute otitis media (AOM), a condition with a similar pathogenesis to ABRS. The three most common pathogens recovered from the middle ear fluid of children with AOM from tympanocentesis are the same as those implicated in ABRS: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis [9\u2022]. Unlike the visit rate for AOM in children younger than 18 years following the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the USA, the visit rate for ARS has remained stable at 11\u201314 visits per 1,000 children between 1998 and 2007, based on national hospital and ambulatory care surveys [13]. Hwang et al. performed a retrospective review of pediatric patients requiring surgical intervention for complicated ARS over a 7-year period [14]. They reported Streptococcus viridans as the leading cause of ARS complications. S. viridans was demonstrated in 44 % of the isolates, as opposed to the typical triad of bacteria in only 20 % of the isolates, none of which were found in children with intracranial complications. Anaerobic bacteria have also been isolated in acute infections by Brook and colleagues, but these organisms are seen most frequently in chronic maxillary rhinosinusitis secondary to dental causes. The most common anaerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli such as Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium [15, 16].",

Although widespread use of PCV7 has significantly decreased pneumococcal invasive disease, there is no strong evidence of a change in the incidence of ABRS. However, it has produced a change in the bacterial flora of the upper airway. In a study by Brook and Gober [19], nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained from children with acute maxillary rhinosinusitis between 1996 and 2000, and between 2001 and 2005. The proportion of S. pneumoniae declined by 18 %, while the proportion of H. influenzae increased by 8 %.",

Published trials in children were reviewed in a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating antibiotic treatment for ARS [20\u2022]. In total, 435 children were included in the trials that were included in the meta-analysis, with a final number of 382 children after attrition. The diagnosis of ARS was based on clinical criteria in two of the studies [21, 22] and clinical and radiologic criteria in the other two [23, 24]. In two of the studies, inclusion of patients with viral URIs was avoided by enrolling patients whose symptoms were of more than 7\u201310 days duration [21, 23]. The third study extended their enrollment to also include patients with symptoms of at least 3 days duration if the symptoms were severe [22], and the final study did not specify duration of symptoms for inclusion, only \u201cworsening\u201d of symptoms [24]. The intervention period ranged from 10 to 14 days of antibiotic or placebo. Outcome scores were obtained at multiple timepoints, mostly ranging from 3 to 14 days from onset of treatment. Half of the studies demonstrated a significantly greater likelihood of cure with antibiotics over placebo, while the other half failed to show a difference. However, the pooled odds ratio for symptom improvement at 10\u201314 days favoring the use of antibiotics was 2.0 [20]. Although the meta-analysis provided modest evidence to support use of antibiotics for ARS in children, it was the authors\u2019 opinion that such efficacy had not been adequately demonstrated in the meta-analysis due to the small number of studies and methodological challenges. In a randomized, controlled study, patients 1\u201315 years of age with clinical and radiographic signs and symptoms of ARS received either a cephalosporin (cefditoren 8\u201312 mg/kg daily) or amoxicillin/clavulanate (80\u201390 mg/kg amoxicillin daily) for 14 days [25]. The results show comparable rates of improvement at 14 days: 78.8 % for cefditoren and 84.7 % for amoxicillin/clavulanate. These rates were not statistically different. The median time to improvement was 3 days in both groups, and the rate of diarrhea was significantly higher in the patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (18 %) compared to those treated with cefditoren (4.5 %).",

However, the results suggest that most cases of uncomplicated acute sinusitis will improve whether treatment is used or not but will improve faster with a higher chance of improvement if treated with antibiotics. Based on this evidence, physicians could recommend symptomatic treatment alone, without the use of antibiotics, for uncomplicated episodes of ARS in children. The AAP practice guidelines recommend antibiotics for bacterial ARS in children with a severe onset or worsening course but recommend either antibiotics or brief outpatient observation for children with persistent illness [9\u2022]. In many instances, children with purulent nasal drainage are sent home from daycare. This creates significant difficulty for working parents who must consequently miss work to care for their children. Whether improving the symptoms of ARS faster by treatment with antibiotics in these children is worth the increased risk of antimicrobial resistance remains to be seen.",

High-dose amoxicillin therapy (80 to 90 mg/kg/day) is recommended in communities with a high prevalence of nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae. In children with moderate to severe illness, younger than 2 years, attending daycare, or recently treated with antibiotics, high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (80 to 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component) is recommended. Low-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (45 mg/kg/day) is appropriate for children suspected of harboring \u03b2-lactamase-producing M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, increased isolates of which may be seen within the next several years since the licensure of PCV13. Cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime) also provide good coverage of typical organisms. Patients with a true type 1 reaction to amoxicillin can also be treated with the abovementioned cephalosporins as recent publications have indicated that the risk of a serious allergic reaction to second- and third-generation cephalosporins in patients with penicillin allergy appears minimal [26\u201328]. Other options include clindamycin and linezolid (good activity against S. pneumonia but lacks activity against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis). Recent resistance surveillance data suggest resistance of pneumococcus and H. influenzae to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin, to a degree that precludes recommending these agents for the treatment of ABRS in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity [9\u2022].",

While the children in both groups showed improvement, there were significant additional reductions in the scores of cough and nasal discharge after the second week in the budesonide group compared to placebo. This data suggests an added benefit of intranasal steroids to antibiotics in the treatment of ARS. Many other trials, performed in mixed adult and pediatric populations (usually 12\u201314 years and older), have shown similar improvements after using an intranasal steroid along with an antibiotic for the treatment of ARS [30, 31]. Therefore, although not overwhelming, there is good evidence to support adding an intranasal steroid to antibiotics in patients being treated for ARS. Finally, in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients older than 12 years with ARS, mometasone 200 mcg twice daily was more effective in controlling symptoms than placebo and amoxicillin [32]. Therefore, there is also some evidence that a high dose of intranasal steroids in older children might be effective as a stand-alone treatment for ARS. Because the appropriate studies have not been performed in that age group, generalizing the use of intranasal steroids as monotherapy for ARS in younger children is not justified. It is important to note, however, that many of these trials suffer from methodological issues.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that evaluated children 0\u201318 years of age with ARS defined as 10\u201330 days of rhinorrhea, congestion, or daytime cough were included. There were no articles that satisfied the set criteria. The authors concluded that there is no evidence to determine whether the use of the abovementioned agents is efficacious in children with ARS. However, in one randomized, placebo-controlled trial, children treated with standard therapy (antibiotics, mucolytics, and decongestants) and nasal irrigation showed greater improvement in nasal airflow, quality of life, and rate of improvement in total symptom score when compared to children taking standard therapy with placebo [34]. Erdosteine, a mucolytic agent, was investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [35]. Eighty-one patients with an average age of 8.5 years completed the study. They all had symptoms consistent with ARS. Both treatment groups had an improvement in symptoms on day 14, but there were no statistically significant differences between the active and placebo groups. As with intranasal steroids, there are no formal recommendations about the use of mucolytics, decongestants, and antihistamines. In fact, the AAP specifically states that antihistamines should not be used for the primary indication of ABRS in any child, except in children with typical allergic symptoms with atopy who also have ABRS [9\u2022].",

The proximity of the paranasal sinuses to the orbit and the brain allows for spread of infection via a direct route. Extension to the orbit can occur when there is a dehiscent lamina papyracea, through the neurovascular foramina, and via thrombophlebitis of the ophthalmic veins. Hematogenous spread is mainly responsible for the development of intracranial complications, though direct extension can occur due to the proximity of the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses to the cranial vault. Bacteria may spread through the diploic veins of the skull and ethmoid sinuses and seed the adjacent meninges. It is paramount to recognize the incipient stages of these complications and initiate appropriate treatment in a timely fashion. This is especially challenging and critical in the case of intracranial complications in which symptoms may be nonspecific in the early stages but can progress rapidly and have significant ramifications if not recognized and treated promptly. The diagnosis of orbital complications is best achieved by physical exam, supplemented by a contrast-enhanced CT scan (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging with or without a venogram is preferred for intracranial evaluation.\n",

However, studies have shown that empiric IV antibiotic therapy (ampicillin-sulbactam) for 24\u201348 h followed by oral therapy is curative in many cases [39]. In communities where there is a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, antibiotic coverage may be modified accordingly [38]. A retrospective review of children who were either managed medically or surgically proposed the following criteria for medical management in select cases: children with normal vision, pupil, and retina; no ophthalmoplegia; an intraocular pressure of less than 20 mmHg; proptosis not greater than 5 mm; and an abscess width of 4 mm or less [40]. A review of the literature that included one prospective case series and four retrospective studies demonstrated a variable cure rate for medical treatment alone, ranging from 26 to 93 %. Surgical intervention was recommended for the following conditions: decrease of visual acuity, nonmedial abscess, clinical deterioration, and failure to improve within 48 h of antibiotic treatment [41].",

If the eye findings are benign, IV antibiotics can be continued and the patient followed daily with serial ophthalmology exams. If the clinical exam does not improve, or eye findings deteriorate, surgical drainage should be pursued, which is usually possible endoscopically. In these cases, an ethmoidectomy is performed with opening of the lamina papyracea and drainage of the subperiosteal abscess. The orbital periosteum is usually not violated. In the rare cases where drainage is not feasible endoscopically, an external ethmoidectomy with drainage is performed.",

The incidence of these complications is between 3 and 10 % [42]. Altman et al. have noted that adolescent males with frontal rhinosinusitis are at an increased risk of rapidly developing intracranial complications and should be aggressively managed. In their series of seven patients, surgical intervention was required with a combined approach with neurosurgery [43]. A review of hospital discharge data across the USA demonstrated that roughly half of all admissions for sinogenic intracranial abscesses were in children ages 10 to 15 [44]. In a large review of cases at two institutions (including adult patients), Clayman et al. found that intracerebral abscesses localized to the frontal lobe were the most common manifestation [45]. Headache and eye pain are the most frequently reported symptoms. Prompt neurological evaluation and imaging should be obtained if any suspicion exists, as intracranial abscesses can be preceded by a quiescent course. Though CT scanning offers excellent visualization of the orbit and bony limits of the brain, MRI is superior in delineating intracranial suppuration [42]. Antibiotic therapy for intracranial complications is appropriate in the setting of meningitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis, but any evidence of abscess by MRI evaluation is an indication for neurosurgical consultation for possible craniotomy in combination with endoscopic sinus surgery [46].",

History and type of symptoms as well as their duration are the cornerstone of the clinical diagnosis (Fig. 2). This is supported by characteristic findings on physical examination. In most cases, this is a self-limited process, and treatment with antibiotics has been shown to accelerate resolution. Whether more speedy recovery provides enough benefit as compared to the disadvantage of the risks associated with frequent antibiotic prescriptions remains to be clarified. Intranasal steroids, nasal irrigations, antihistamines, decongestants, and mucolytics are all utilized for ancillary therapy and are supported by variable degrees of evidence. Because the evidence supporting these ancillary therapies is scanty in children, there is no strong formal recommendation for their use. Early recognition and diagnosis of orbital and intracranial complications can limit management to intravenous antibiotic therapy, with surgical intervention reserved for more aggressive cases.\n",
