            "text": "Viral infection of mammals results in certain typical responses by the host immune system. These responses are initiated by the innate immune system, which recognizes 'molecular patterns' (such as double-stranded RNA) that are unique to pathogens. The adaptive immune system \u2014 which consists of T cells that can kill virus-infected cells and B cells that produce pathogen-specific antibodies \u2014 then proceeds to mount a response. Initiation of the adaptive and/or innate immune response results in the production of chemokines and other cytokines that induce a pro-inflammatory response and attract cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to sites of infection. These cells, in turn, might release cytotoxic substances, such as matrix metalloproteinases. Although these responses are crucial to clear the infection, all of these processes can cause damage to normal host tissues. Indeed, 'side-effects' of the immune response account for many of the signs and symptoms in human infections: for example, during infection with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, measles virus or respiratory syncytial virus1,2,3. Consequently, a 'normal' immune response often results in a transient disequilibrium of tissue homeostasis, and this is required for clearance of an infection but can contribute to disease. In this Review, we consider any immune response that results in an increase in clinical disease or tissue destruction to be immunopathological.",

            "text": "In many cases, immunopathogenesis is the outcome of immune dysregulation rather than of a normal response (Table 1). This could occur in one of three ways. First, viral infection might result in an intense inflammatory response that compromises physiological function or results in excessive destruction of host tissue. In this situation, viral infection might interfere with the normal feedback mechanisms that control inflammation, and pro-inflammatory chemokines or other cytokines might be produced in large amounts or for an excessive period. For example, induction of expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consequence of activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38MAPK) by the murine coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV)4. Excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators might then result in an unchecked influx of pro-inflammatory cells to the site of infection. Several of these types of cell, most notably neutrophils and macrophages, contribute to inflammation by producing toxic agents, such as reactive oxygen species, that kill both infected and normal cells at sites of infection, which would further exacerbate the response and result in immunopathological changes such as HAEMOPHAGOCYTOSIS5. Several of the released pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), also induce apoptosis, which would result in increased tissue destruction. In addition, activated T cells that are not specific for the infecting virus or host antigens at the site of infection could traffic to sites of inflammation and contribute to tissue destruction, presumably through the production of chemokines or other cytokines. This has been shown for MHV-infected mice and is known as bystander activation (Table 1).",

Pathogen-specific antibodies or T cells might also recognize a host protein or epitope (through a process known as MOLECULAR MIMICRY). In other cases, prolonged infection and the ensuing tissue destruction might result in presentation of host-protein-derived T- or B-cell epitopes that were previously cryptic (through a process known as EPITOPE SPREADING). The response to these epitopes might prolong the inflammatory response, with consequent tissue destruction, even after virus has been cleared. These autoimmune responses would be limited to a certain tissue or cell type by the specificity of the immune cells involved. Several such mechanisms of autoimmune immunopathogenesis have been described for models of both coronavirus infection and non-coronavirus infection; these are described in Table 1.",

As a family, the Coronaviridae have a broad host range and cause a wide variety of gastrointestinal, respiratory and systemic diseases in animals, including infectious bronchitis in birds, a fatal disease with multi-organ involvement in felines, and enteritis in pigs, cows, turkeys and dogs. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory disease and, to a lesser extent, gastroenteritis. The viruses human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and HCoV-229E have long been known to be causative agents of the common cold, and the more recently identified agents HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause more severe, although rarely fatal, infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract10,11,12. SARS-CoV, which causes a much more severe respiratory disease, seems to be an ENZOOTIC VIRUS in Southeast Asia. Several species that might be infected, such as masked palm civets (Paguma larvata), are consumed as food in parts of China, and the 'wet markets', at which live animals are bought and sold, are likely venues for the initial crossover event to humans8. The 2002\u20132003 outbreak of SARS in humans probably resulted from an interspecific transfer of the virus by aerosols from live, exotic animals that were infected with SARS-CoV to workers in these wet markets. Sera from masked palm civets, raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and Chinese ferret-badgers (Melogale moschata) were shown to contain neutralizing antibodies that were specific for SARS-CoV, and virus that was nearly identical to the strains that were isolated from infected humans was detected in masked palm civets13,14,15. However, a specific animal reservoir for the virus has yet to be definitively identified.",

In two-thirds of infected patients, the disease progresses to an atypical pneumonia, with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli. Many of these patients also develop watery diarrhoea with active virus shedding, which might increase the transmissibility of the virus. Respiratory insufficiency leading to respiratory failure is the most common cause of death among those infected with SARS-CoV8. Consistent with these clinical observations, the host cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is detected in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract16,17. Because it binds ACE2, SARS-CoV might contribute to lung-tissue injury by a novel mechanism. ACE2 has a protective role during acute lung injury. By binding ACE2, SARS-CoV leads to the downregulation of ACE2 expression and might therefore negate the protective effect of ACE2. This mechanism of injury was shown in a mouse model using SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein, through which the virus binds ACE2, but it has not yet been confirmed in humans or animals that are infected with SARS-CoV18,19. Severe cases of SARS are associated with lymphopaenia, neutrophilia, mild thrombocytopaenia and coagulation defects20. Haemophagocytosis, which is indicative of cytokine dysregulation, is also detected in some patients with severe disease21,22.",

SARS-CoV directly infects T cells, contributing to lymphopaenia and to atrophy of the spleen and lymphoid tissue25. The murine coronavirus MHV-3 also infects and destroys lymphocytes, thereby facilitating viral replication and persistence28. SARS-CoV-infected lymphocytes, similar to FIPV-infected macrophages in domestic cats, might transport the virus to distant organs, resulting in systemic infection25. Macrophages, both infected and uninfected, are detected in large numbers in the lungs of patients who died as a result of SARS22,25,29. Although infected macrophages have been found in vivo, SARS-CoV causes an ABORTIVE INFECTION of these cells in vitro30,31,32. SARS-CoV also interferes with the initiation of the innate immune response by inhibiting the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) by infected cells, including human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. IFN production requires the phosphorylation and dimerization of a constitutively expressed protein, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 is not activated, at least in vitro, after infection with SARS-CoV30,31,32,33,34. By contrast, expression of chemokines such as CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3, CCL5 and CCL8 is upregulated by abortively infected DCs and macrophages and might contribute to the influx of monocytes and/or macrophages that is observed in infected tissues30,34; CXCL10 and CCL2 expression are also upregulated in the blood of patients with SARS35. Expression of CXCL8 (also known as IL-8), which is an attractant for neutrophils, is also upregulated in the serum of patients with SARS35,36,37. Consistent with a role for CXCL8 in pathogenesis, severe disease is associated with an increase in the number of neutrophils in the blood20,38.",

Increased concentrations of these anti-inflammatory molecules might impair clearance of virus. The mechanism by which chemokines and other cytokines are regulated in infected patients is not known, but SARS-CoV induces the activation of p38MAPK in monocytes39. The murine coronavirus, MHV, also induces p38MAPK activation, and inhibition of p38MAPK activation results in decreased production of infectious MHV4. Induction of p38MAPK expression by MHV results in production of IL-6 and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 4E (EIF4E), which increases cap-dependent (including MHV-specific) protein production. By analogy, it is possible that increased cytokine production by the monocytes of patients with SARS might be an untoward consequence of a mechanism that is used by the virus to increase replication in some cells4.",

These increased viral burdens resulted in repeated bouts of disease, which again coincided with fever, weight loss and lymphopaenia. FIPV-infected felines develop histological evidence of SEROSITIS and PYOGRANULOMATOUS VASCULITIS.

In support of this idea, both macrophages and DCs express CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N), the receptor for FIPV, and infection of macrophages by FIPV has been shown in vitro41,44 (Fig. 2a, b). Infected macrophages traffic throughout the body, resulting in a disseminated infection. In lymph nodes, infection of macrophages and DCs might alter the interaction of these cells with T cells so that they dampen, rather than reinforce, the FIPV-specific T-cell response. This might occur through induction of expression of IL-10 (probably produced by macrophages), which is present in increased amounts in infected lymph nodes45. The production of IL-10 might skew the immune response away from a protective T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response towards a non-protective TH2-cell response, thereby diminishing the ability of immune cells to clear the virus. Regarding the lymphopaenia, lymphocyte apoptosis is commonly observed in infected lymphoid tissues, although lymphocytes are not themselves infected by the virus42,46,47. So, lymphoid-cell depletion is probably mediated by a soluble factor. In support of this idea, conditioned media from peritoneal or splenic cells that were isolated from infected domestic cats and cultured in vitro induced the apoptosis of T cells46. The specific factor that is responsible for apoptosis has not yet been identified, although TNF, a factor that is implicated in lymphocyte apoptosis, is detected at increased levels in domestic cats with FIP48,49. By contrast, domestic cats that are exposed to FIPV but do not develop disease show lymphoid hyperplasia, which is consistent with the development of a protective T-cell response50.",

Although the aetiology of B-cell hyperplasia is not known, it most probably results from aberrant cytokine production by infected macrophages. Neutralizing antibodies that are raised during FIPV infection and other coronavirus infections are mainly directed against spike protein. In the case of FIPV, however, the presence of these antibodies does not provide sterilizing immunity. Instead, these antibodies opsonize virus particles and facilitate their entry to monocytes and/or macrophages through Fc\u03b3 receptors (receptors for IgG)40 (Fig. 2a, c). Furthermore, antigen\u2013antibody complexes are deposited in the blood-vessel walls. These complexes activate complement, leading to vasculitis and oedema, and might thereby contribute to the development of the wet form of FIP40. Antigen\u2013antibody-complex formation and its consequences occur late in the course of disease and are predictive of a poor outcome53. Indeed, the humoral response that develops in FECV-immune domestic cats does not protect animals against FIPV infection and might contribute to a particularly fulminant disease known as early death syndrome. This 'enhanced' form of disease has not been documented for animals that are naturally infected but has been shown for domestic cats that are passively or actively immunized against FIPV. Administration of spike-protein-specific antibodies to uninfected domestic cats or active immunization of domestic cats with recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses spike protein results in an accelerated disease course after infection with FIPV54,55. This syndrome does not develop in FECV-infected domestic cats, possibly reflecting the ability of FIPV to replicate more efficiently in macrophages. This accelerated pathogenesis of FIPV in immunized animals provides strong support for the idea that the immune response is an important contributing factor to disease.",

Accordingly, mice that receive sub-lethal doses of irradiation or are congenitally immunodeficient (such as mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or mice that are deficient in recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1 ) activity) do not develop demyelination after infection with MHV-JHM61,62,63,64.

Mice that have defective MHC class I or class II expression and therefore lack CD8+ or CD4+ T cells, respectively, develop demyelination when infected with MHV-JHM or MHV-A59 (Refs 64, 73). Other studies have used adoptive transfer of MHV-JHM-specific immune cells to infected Rag1-/-mice; in the absence of transferred cells, these mice do not develop demyelination after infection with MHV-JHM, but transfer of splenocytes results in robust demyelination. Infected Rag1-/- mice that are reconstituted with either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from a mouse that is immune to infection with MHV-JHM also develop demyelination. Demyelination can also be induced by CD8+ T cells that do not recognize viral or CNS antigens, if these T cells are sufficiently activated74 (a process that is known as bystander activation) (Table 1). Accordingly, MHV-JHM-infected Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice that expressed a single T-cell receptor specific for an epitope encoded by another virus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) developed demyelination, but this only occurred when the transgenic T cells were activated by cognate antigen.",

MHV-3-infected C3H mice also develop a chronic thrombotic vasculitis, with viral antigen detected in endothelia. The pathogenesis of this disease is not well understood, but it is likely to be immune mediated. MHV-3, unlike the neurotropic MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 strains, infects T and B cells. This infection is largely non-productive but results in lymphocyte death, perhaps by apoptosis, with consequent cellular and humoral immunosuppression. This immunosuppression is an important contributory factor to the persistence of MHV-3 (Ref. 28).",

Although it has not been proven for IBV-infected chickens, it is probable that this excessive production of mucus is mediated by several cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and CXCL8, which are secreted by infected epithelial cells in other respiratory-virus infections94. CXCL8 is an attractant for neutrophils, which are one of the main cellular components of the nasal exudates that are found in infected chickens. Neutrophil depletion by 5-fluorouracil has been shown to reduce the thickness of the nasal exudate, thereby diminishing epithelial-cell damage and cilia loss95. Similarly, the early stages of renal disease are characterized by a massive infiltration of neutrophils96. Collectively, these observations indicate that the cellular innate immune response to the virus is an important factor in the development of severe disease.",

However, as also outlined in this Review, the pathogenesis of several animal coronaviruses includes an immune-mediated component. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that similar mechanisms occur in SARS. Clearly, it is crucial to determine the extent to which the pathological changes that are observed in SARS result from direct destruction by virus compared with immune-mediated elimination of infected cells. In FIPV-infected domestic cats, increased viral replication initiates a cascade of events that leads to injury to the immune system, as well as to several organs42,43, whereas in mice with MHV-mediated demyelination, clinical disease and myelin destruction increase as virus is cleared70,71,76. In patients with SARS, virus is detected in the lungs and in immune cells at the time of death, indicating that virus directly causes pulmonary and immune-system injury25,26,27. However, the kinetics of viral clearance from sites of infection in individual patients need to be established before the role of the host immune response in the disease process can be fully evaluated.",

In the case of another human coronavirus, HCoV-229E, development of a mouse model of infection required transgenic expression of the human host-cell receptor (CD13), disruption of the innate immune response of the mouse and adaptation of the virus to growth in CD13-expressing mouse cells109. Mouse and rat ACE2 molecules are less-efficient receptors for SARS-CoV than is human ACE2 (Ref. 110), and the development of a useful murine model of SARS will probably require transgenic expression of human ACE2. However, by analogy with the mouse model of HCoV-229E infection, the development of a transgenic mouse might be only the first step towards developing a useful murine model.

ORF1a and ORF1b, which account for about two-thirds of the genome, both encode large polyproteins. ORF1b protein is produced by a \u20131-base-pair ribosomal frameshift from the reading frame of ORF1a. The SARS-CoV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N).

The virus is then internalized and released into the cytoplasm. c | In antibody-dependent entry, specific antibodies bind the spike protein. The antibody-opsonized FIPV virions then interact with Fc\u03b3Rs (receptors for IgG). Some evidence indicates that this process augments the normal spike\u2013CD13 interaction. After binding of the opsonized virions to Fc\u03b3Rs, the virus is internalized and released into the cytoplasm. Antigen\u2013antibody complexes are also deposited in the vasculature, resulting in complement activation. Activation of complement contributes to the development of vasculitis and oedema, with death of the animal occurring soon after.

Myelin destruction is mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and these cells activate macrophages by the production of cytokines (b) or kill infected cells directly (c), both of which result in demyelination. In recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1\u2212/\u2212) mice, which lack T and B cells, two additional mechanisms of demyelination have been elucidated. Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice do not develop demyelination when infected with the JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM); as occurs in immunocompetent mice, demyelination develops after the adoptive transfer of MHV-JHM-specific T cells. However, demyelination also results if infected Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice are infected with a recombinant MHV-JHM expressing the macrophage attractant CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) (d), presumably by direct activation of macrophages. Similarly, exogenous delivery of neutralizing MHV-JHM-specific antibody (e) results in macrophage activation and demyelination; this process depends on activation through complement and activating Fcg receptors (receptors for IgG).

Subsequently, a signalling pathway involving p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) activation, as well as the nucleocapsid protein and other unknown host factors, is initiated (c), resulting, ultimately, in binding of the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1) to the gene that encodes fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) (d), which is a prothrombinase.
