Moreover, illegal migration to KSA for work or Hajj adds to this burden because most illegal immigrants do not have the required vaccinations. In recent years and with improvements in infrastructure and health services, an emerging burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is unfolding; studies found high rates of obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure (6\u201310).

This threat requires lots of effort and resources for infectious disease control and prevention. Conditions surrounding the Hajj such as extended stays in a single geographic area, physical exhaustion, extreme heat, and crowded accommodations usually lead to disease transmission, especially of airborne agents (5). The novel beta coronavirus called HCoV-EMC that infected a Saudi patient in June 2012 is a reminder that outbreaks will continue to be a major challenge (20).",

The MOH implemented several new programs to control and prevent disease. A compulsory vaccination program, which started in the 1980s and has been updated since, has led to a substantial drop in mortality among those aged less than 5 years, from 250 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 26 per 1,000 live births in 2005 (21). An innovative 5-year project was launched in 2012 in collaboration with IHME to create an integrated tracking system to monitor the health status of Saudi citizens and determine health policy priorities.

As a result, KSA has a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome of 39.3% (25) and coronary artery diseases of 5.5% (26). Smoking prevalence in KSA ranges from 1.4% among females aged 15 through 64 years to 24.2% among males aged 15 through 64 years (27,28). The prevalence differs among the age groups, with males more likely than females to smoke (median for males, 26.5%, and for females, 9%) (27). Another important issue is water-pipe smoking (known as shisha), which seems to be highly prevalent among teenagers (29).",

This newly established system uses a digital camera network connected to the National Information Center to track any violations and to control traffic (31).
