According to the draft guidelines stated in the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) [10] and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products [11], various aspects of extraction and analysis must be performed for the purpose of certification of herbal drugs and botanical preparations. The methods found in the monographs of Pharmacopoeia and other reports [12, 13] often describe extraction methods such as sonication, heating under reflux, Soxhlet extraction and others. Extraction and determination of glycyrrhizin from plant roots or herbal drugs is still more widely conducted [14\u201316] and is conventionally performed by solvent extraction [17].",

The principle of heating using microwave energy is based on the direct effect of microwaves on molecules by ionic conduction and dipole rotation. If MAE is performed in closed vessels, extractions can be carried out at temperatures above the boiling point of the solvent, thus increasing extraction speed and efficiency. Also, MAE requires much lower volume of organic solvent, reduces extraction time and allow the preparation of multiple samples in one step [23, 24].",

A two level full factorial design was used as a screening method in order to select the variables that have influence on the MAE efficiency and subsequently a statistical model of the Box\u2013Behnken design was used to determine the optimum value for each variable. The variables considered in MAE were extraction temperature, time and sample volume and also ethanol percentage and microwave power. The extraction efficiency obtained with MAE in optimum condition was compared to the liquid extraction method. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying this method to determine the glycyrrhizin in real samples by analyzing commercial herbal formulations was examined.",

The variables considered in MAE were extraction temperature and extraction time, sample volume, ethanol percentage and microwave power. The experimental design matrix and obtained average values of the extracted amount of glycyrrhizin are shown in Table 1.

The minimal volume necessary to wet every sample and the maximum volume of an extraction microwave vessel were considered to determine the solvent volume.

The precision was better for MAE than for LE. Plant tissue consists of cells surrounded by walls. The cells exist in the form of glands that are filled with active compounds such as glycyrrhizin. A characteristic of such glands is that their skin is very thin and can be very easily destroyed, therefore, the type of extraction method can influence of recovery results. The leaching and milling had important effects on extraction of essential oil and active ingredient compounds from plants in classical methods such as LE. Also, the plant matrix has impermeable cores covered by an organic boundary layer. The transfer mechanism is governed by capillary flow and depends upon solvent viscosity. Virot et al. [30] reported that in LE, mass transfer occurs from the inside to the outside while heat transfer occurs from the outside to the inside. In MAE, microwave energy absorb by internal components of cell. Thus the two transport phenomena operate in the same direction from the inside of the extracted material to the bulk solvent.",
