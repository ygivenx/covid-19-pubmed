            "text": "Classified within the genus Circovirus of the Circoviridae family, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) was initially identified in a Canadian swine herd in 1991, and since then, has been implicated as the etiological agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [1]. This disease of pigs is clinically characterised by growth retardation, paleness of skin, dyspnoea, enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes and occasionally jaundice and diarrhoea. Besides PMWS, other diseases have been associated to PCV2, namely porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), reproductive failure, proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, congenital tremors and central nervous system diseases [6]. PCV2 infection has a serious economic impact on the swine industry worldwide, having been diagnosed in the five continents [5]. Although mortality is comparatively low (4\u201320%), morbidity can reach up to 50\u201360% in affected farms [15]. However, since vaccination was introduced in 2006 [4], the occurrence of PMWS has declined abruptly [13]. The presence of PCV2 in healthy pigs suggests that although the virus presence is crucial to induce PMWS, additional factors are also involved in the development of clinical disease [5].",

After that, quantitative PCR [2] and loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) PCR [22] were reported for the identification of PCV2. More recently, DNA microarrays [8], as well as isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification assays, were described for the diagnosis of PCV2 in pigs [18]. Other real-time PCR reactions were reported [19\u201321], all of them based on ORF2, in which the variability observed among strains is higher than in ORF1. Moreover, one of the reactions [19] uses SYBR Green technology, less accurate, detecting a minimum of 1000 copies; while the other two, based on a TaqMan Probe exhibit limits of detection of 10 [21] and 25 [20]. The detection of PCV2 antibodies are commonly performed by ELISA using commercial kits.",

The amplicon was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), originating the TA-CircSac recombinant. Another fragment of 850 bp comprising the region between EcoRI and SacII restriction sites, amplified with primers EcoF (5\u2032-GCGGAATTCAACCTTAACCTTTCTTATTCT-3\u2032) and SacR, was cloned into pEGFP vector (Clontech), giving rise to pCircEcoSac. The infectious clone was constructed after restriction of both plasmids with SacII restriction enzyme by cloning CircSac fragment of TA-CircSac into pCircEcoSac, using One Shot TOP10F\u2019 chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen), originating pCirc. The plasmid, with a total size of 7325 bp, was extracted using the Plasmid Midi Purification kit (Qiagen) and the concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. The concentration of the stock solution was 1.25 \u00d7 10\u22126 g/\u03bcl.",
