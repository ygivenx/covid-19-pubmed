A dedicated team of four doctors collected weekly specimens from the throat and conjunctiva from each consenting patient.

Our laboratory was the primary center for SARS-CoV isolation during the epidemic, and we had not been successful in isolating viruses from stool samples. A stool sample positive for SARS-CoV, from convalescent-phase SARS patients, would probably have a minimal effect on the public. Secondary SARS cases from convalescent-phase SARS patients discharged from the hospital have not been reported. We, however, still recommend caution, especially in pediatric patients and adults requiring full nursing aid, since SARS-CoV can survive for at least 2 to 4 days at room temperature (12).",
