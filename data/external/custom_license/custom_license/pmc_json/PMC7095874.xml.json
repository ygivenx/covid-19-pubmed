A statistical analysis of 1,425 suspected SARS patients in Hong Kong revealed that the death rate from SARS is about 55% in people over 60 and up to 13.2% in younger people. Scientists are also considering the possibility that the elderly, and those already battling other ailments, are particularly infectious. These 'superspreaders' are rare carriers who can infect 10 or more people.",
