The main goal of the program is to prepare laboratorians to work at our maximum biocontainment laboratory. Before being admitted to the training program, applicants must demonstrate proficient work experience in lower containment level laboratories, particularly BSL-3, and undergo medical examinations and security checks. We constructed a realistic training laboratory with bioseal doors, pressure sensors, a chemical shower room, air connection ports, biosafety cabinets (BSCs), an autoclave, and general laboratory equipment (Figure, panel A). In this laboratory, trainees gain experience wearing a positive-pressure suit (Figure, panel B) and become familiar with working in the BSL-4 environment without actually handling microbes. To ensure documentation of all training, we developed online training management software, which supports registration, staff pre-assessment, needs assessments, a theoretical examination, record keeping, and analysis of training efficiency.",
