In retrospect, the clinical features fit into the WHO case definition of SARS; however, it was not reported widely at that stage. SARS was first recognised in Hong Kong in late February, 2003.[9,10]The index case, a doctor from southern China, had been unwell before travelling to Hong Kong. He was admitted to one of the public hospitals in Hong Kong with symptoms of atypical pneumonia. Immediately an outbreak was triggered, firstly in the hospital and later spreading widely throughout the community.",

Based on their data, Lee et al.[9]proposed that the presentation of SARS was triphasic. The first phase, termed the viral replication phase, occurred in the first week with most patients presenting with fever, myalgia and chills. As the disease progressed into second week, 70% of the patients developed early immune response and cytokines were found in the blood stream. In this immune hyperactive phase, there was significant lung destruction and patients began to develop respiratory symptoms and observable chest radiographic changes. In the third week, patients entered the pulmonary destruction phase, which clinically resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome. Canadian data suggest that the earliest symptoms are fever, prodromal symptoms, cough or dyspnoea and diarrhoea.[2]From the outbreak in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong, Peiris et al.[13]found that many patients developed recurrent fever (85%) and watery diarrhoea (73%).",

The virus has been found to be stable in faeces (and urine) at room temperature for at least 1\u20132 days.[15]Transmission through a defective sewage system was, in fact, proven in the case of the outbreak at Amoy Gardens Estate in Hong Kong.[16]The SARS virus has been reported as occurring in saliva, tears and urine.[1]At the time of writing, no evidence of the SARS virus in a patient\u2019s sweat has been reported. Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to assume that the SARS virus may be present in a patient\u2019s sweat as it is in other bodily fluids. As summarised by the WHO,[1]the SARS-CoV has been isolated after 36 hours from seating, paper, a Formica surface, a plastered wall; after 72 hours from a plastic surface and stainless steel; and after 96 hours on a glass slide. It is, therefore, possible that the virus can be transmitted by hands that have been in contact with these infected surfaces.",

Nieman et al.[24]have noted that 45 minutes of exercise five times per week at 60% of the heart rate reserve reduced the duration of respiratory symptoms but did not affect the incidence of URTI in 25- to 45-year-old women. In a later study, Nieman et al.[25]investigated the relationship between poor immune function and low levels of physical activity in a group of elderly women. They concluded that any benefit of regular physical activity was more obvious in this group. In this study, they found that among 67- to 85-year-old women, the incidence of URTI was lowest in a highly conditioned subgroup, intermediate in a subgroup of regular walkers and highest in callisthenic and sedentary control subgroups. They suggested that T cells were the major component of the immune system to be altered with age and that a highly conditioned elderly woman might have T cells that function at levels above their sedentary counterparts but still somewhat lower than those of young women. On the other hand, natural killer cell activity was considerably greater in highly conditioned elderly women than in either sedentary elderly or young women. Hence, continuous regular moderate exercise can boost the immune systems of elderly women.",

Therefore, it is usually only those who have weak immune systems, such as the elderly,[26]who will not have an immune response to the invading virus.

A muscle strengthening programme may be prescribed prior to cardiovascular training. After weeks of bed rest, muscle condition may decrease significantly.[40]Therefore, muscle strengthening programmes, especially for lower body muscles are required before recovering patients can perform other locomotory rehabilitation programmes. However, extra attention should be given to the possible presence of any postviral fatigue syndrome. This is the prolonged period of debilitation sometimes observed during the recovery phase from an apparent viral infection.[24]Although there has been no report to date, of any postviral fatigue syndrome in relation to SARS, the risk of an extended clinical course resulting from attempts to work through this syndrome should be noted.[38]",

Therefore, the surgical mask must be able to inhibit aerosol penetration. McCullough et al.[41]stated that the penetration rate of aerosols through a surgical mask depended on the flow rate and the type of organism in the aerosols. When Mycobacterium abscessus and Bacillus subtilis were assessed at a high flow rate (85 L/min), there was significantly higher penetration than what was seen at a low flow rate (45 L/min). The surgical mask was much less efficient in blocking aerosols than was the N95 mask.[41]The surgical mask with a filter had a 25% penetration rate of sub-micrometre-sized aerosols at a flow rate of 5 L/min to 70% at 100 L/min.[42]The penetration rate through surgical masks can be well over 25% when the children are working or exercising at moderate or maximal intensity. The maximal ventilation rate for children aged 11.2 \u00b1 1.4 years (in Hong Kong) has been found to be about 46.7 \u00b1 10.1 L/min for girls and 50.3 \u00b1 11.0 L/min for boys (unpublished data).

Johnson et al.[45]noted that workers wearing masks could not work as long or as hard as they could when not wearing masks. Such phenomena may also occur in exercise. Lerman et al.[46]found that with the increase in inspiratory resistance due to wearing a mask during exercise testing, a significant decrease in physical performance and tidal volume, an increase in the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory time, peak inspiratory pressure and increased CO2 retention were observed. They concluded that difficulty in inspiration was significantly correlated with inspiratory resistance and seemed to be the main reason for cessation of effort. Wilson and Raven[47]also noted that wearing of respirator masks reduced forced vital capacity by an average of 11.6% (0.65L); forced expiratory volume in 1 second by 7.3% (0.33L) and maximum voluntary ventilation in 15 seconds by 7.4% (12.4 L/min). They hypothesised that the difference in peak inspired flow with and without the respirator was the best predictor of performance time with the respirator during an endurance walk to exhaustion. Therefore, the resistance of the mask results in a detrimental effect on exercise performance, especially at maximal loading.",
