Malaysia confirmed its first case of influenza A(H1N1) on May 15, 2009. In response to increasing local transmission, Malaysia moved from containment to mitigation stage on July 9, 2009 [1]. Since then, the A(H1N1) pandemic has grown exponentially. On July 23, 2009, approximately 2 weeks after the commencement of this study, the first death from influenza A(H1N1) was reported. On September 13, 2009, the date on which our data collection finished, the total fatality count was 74 [2].",

During the SARS epidemic, public perceptions affected health behaviors such as handwashing and wearing face masks, which in turn contributed to the control of the epidemic [11, 12]. In both the SARS and H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks, public fear and level of distress was associated with perceptions and knowledge [8, 13].",

Of note, the survey was carried out over a period of escalating reported deaths, generating much public and media concern. Malaysia is a fast-developing country in Southeast Asia with a population of 27.7 million, which encompasses a majority Malay (50.8%) and other ethnic groups, mainly Chinese (23.0%), non-Malay bumiputra (11.0%), and Indian (6.9%) [17]. Each ethnic group has its own culture and religions. This multiethnic, multi-religious society allow for a diverse exploration of cultural variation in expression of attitudes and perceptions towards the new A(H1N1) pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of knowledge and attitudes towards the influenza A(H1N1) outbreak across various ethnic groups and socio-demographic backgrounds.",

T tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for comparisons of means; the chi-squared test was used to test the significance of differences in percentages. Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey's HSD test were conducted to evaluate pairwise differences among the means. Multiple linear regression analysis using the enter method was carried out to explore relationships between knowledge scores and socio-demographic variables that had a P value less than 0.10 in bivariate comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1), and perceived confidence in A(H1N1) prevention. A backward stepwise logistic regression selection method was carried out to select significant independent variables and make adjustments for covariates among variables. Wald chi-squared statistics were used to test the significance of individual coefficients in the model. Goodness of fit was assessed with the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test. Statistical significance was set to P < 0.05.",

In contrast, rates of those who were \u201cvery\u201d and \u201cquite\u201d confident in prevention of H1N1 infection decreased significantly as the number of reported deaths increased. As indicated in Table 5, univariate analysis showed that significantly more males (39.6%) than females (33.2%) perceived very high/high susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection. High perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection was inversely related to age. Respondents with higher education, who were employed, and living in urban areas had significantly higher perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection. Respondents with higher knowledge scores indicated higher perceived self susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection. In the multiple logistic regression analyses, significant predictors for high susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection were ages 18\u201339 years (OR = 2.37, vs. being 60\u201379 years), ages 40\u201359 years (OR = 2.12, vs. being 60\u201379 years), household income RM2,001\u20134,000 (OR 1.47, vs. >RM4,000), and residing in urban areas (OR = 1.62, vs. suburban). The overall logistic model is highly significant according to the Model chi-square statistic (chi-square = 37.80, df = 12, P < 0.0001).\n\n\n\n",

This was likely due to the frequent references of A(H1N1) virus as \u201cswine flu\u201d in the early stages of the pandemic. Compared to a recent Hong Kong study [14], more respondents in Malaysia thought that A(H1N1) could be transmitted by eating pork products (31.3%, vs. 6.9%), more did not know that the A(H1N1) virus is transmittable via droplets (8.7%, vs. 2.0%), while fewer did not know that the A(H1N1) virus is transmittable via contact with contaminated objects (16.8% vs. 21.1%).

Thus, these specific groups of people may require targeted education [8, 10]. Despite the overestimation of the severity of A(H1N1), a high proportion of the participants in this study reported low perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection, which did not change significantly over the study period, despite the increasing number of deaths.

It has been shown that perceived vulnerability for SARS was significantly associated with perceived threat [19]. Additionally, perceptions of risk and severity were found to influence public's behavioral responses to pandemic influenza [9, 20] More research is needed to investigate why the Malaysian public overestimates the severity of this new disease and yet under-perceives its risk of infection, to provide insight into how the health authorities or media should disseminate information to counteract these misconceptions in the future. The findings of our multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that education to enhance perceived susceptibility to A(H1N1) infection should focus on people of older age and people living in suburban areas.",

Similar trends were observed during the SARS outbreak, whereby anxiety levels closely mirrored the daily number of new cases and were strongly associated with the intensity of the outbreak [22]. Moderate fear has been shown as most effective at motivating health-protective behaviors. According to Janis' fear-as-acquired drive model, low levels of fear lead to inaction, moderate levels produce self-protective behavior, whereas high levels result in counterproductive defensive responses [23]. Therefore, health authorities should disseminate accurate information and a realistic view of associated risks to induce a moderate level of fear in order to encourage people to take precautions [21].",
