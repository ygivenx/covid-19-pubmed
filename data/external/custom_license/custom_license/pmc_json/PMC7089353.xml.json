            "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a widespread senile dementia characterized by the progressive formation of insoluble amyloid plaques in the brain. The amyloid plaques comprise a 4 kDa \u03b2-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) derived by sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the activities of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases (Tanahashi and Tabira 2007; McConlogue et al. 2007). These enzymes are considered to be therapeutic targets important in the treatment of AD (Pastarino et al. 2004). However, \u03b3-secretase is not an ideal therapeutic target because it is also responsible for the cleavage of a number of other important cellular proteins involved in signaling processes. Thus, \u03b2-secretase, or \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE), is a more attractive therapeutic target (Parsons and Austen 2007). Chang et al. (2007) showed that immunization of transgenic AD mice (Tg2576) with BACE resulted in A\u03b2 reduction and cognitive improvement. They suggested that immunization may have resulted in anti-BACE antibodies penetrating the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and binding to BACE located on neuronal surfaces, thereby inhibiting enzyme activity. When BACE-antibody complex is endocytosed, BACE cleavage of APP is inhibited by the bound antibody, resulting in a decrease in A\u03b2 production. Consequently, immunization with BACE to produce antibodies that neutralize \u03b2-secretase activity leading to a reduction in A\u03b2 is being considered as a new therapeutic concept for AD. Previously, it was shown that although BACE knockout mice have reduced A\u03b2 production, they do not exhibit any abnormal phenotypes (Luo et al. 2001). The BACE gene was cloned and characterized in 1999 (Vassar et al. 1999), and various BACE constructs have been expressed in insect (Bruinzeel et al. 2002), mammalian (Emmons et al. 2008), and E. coli cells (Sardana et al. 2004; Tomasselli et al. 2008).",

The recombinant protein yield can be dramatically increased, especially in tobacco, because a leaf cell contains as many as 100 chloroplasts, with up to 100 genomes each; a total of approximately 10,000 plastome copies per cell. Biopharmaceutical compounds, such as human somatotropin (Staub et al. 2000), human papillomavirus L1 protein (Fernandez-San Millan et al. 2008), the B-subunit of the cholera toxin (CTB) (Daniell et al. 2001a), and the tetanus toxin (Tregoning et al. 2005), have been expressed at high levels (4\u201325% of TSP). Additionally, environmental concerns regarding transgene escape via pollen from nuclear transgenic plants is abrogated by chloroplast transformation due to the maternal inheritance of plastids in most cultivated plants (Molina et al. 2004).",

            "text": "Recently, in our laboratory, human BACE protein was expressed in nuclear transformed transgenic potato and tomato plants in an attempt to develop a plant-derived AD vaccine (Youm et al. unpublished data). Following analysis of these transgenic plants, the human BACE was shown to accumulate to levels of 0.12\u20130.19% of total soluble protein (TSP). Low levels of heterologous protein accumulation in plants is regarded as one of the limiting factors in the commercialization of plant-derived vaccines. Here, we introduced a human BACE gene into the plastome of tobacco plants to increase transgenic protein accumulation. Tobacco plants produce a large biomass, yielding approximately 170 metric tons of biomass per hectare (Fischer and Emans 2000). Tobacco, a nonfood and non-feed crop, is self-pollinating, thus minimizing transgene escape. Most importantly, we chose tobacco because it is a model plant for plastid transformation and is closely related to potato and tomato plants. In the current study, we report on the integration and expression of the human BACE gene in the plastome. The accumulation levels and antigenicity of the BACE protein derived from transplastomic tobacco were analyzed by western blot or ELISA. The immunogenic responses of tobacco plastid-derived BACE were observed by oral application in test mice. We discuss the potential use of plastid-derived BACE antigen as a new oral vaccine against AD. This may be the first step toward developing a plant-based vaccine against AD.",

Thus, a therapeutic agent that could fundamentally inhibit the degeneration of neurons by inhibiting the production and toxicity of A\u03b2 would be a highly effective means of preventing and treating AD. A\u03b2 is produced by the cleavage actions of \u03b2-secretase (BACE) and \u03b3-secretase during an amyloidogenic metabolic process. \u03b2-secretase inhibition may prevent dementia; this would be more efficient and economical than removing previously formed A\u03b2. Therefore, \u03b2-secretase inhibition through vaccination is presently receiving increased attention worldwide (McConlogue et al. 2007).",

            "text": "In the present study, attempts were made to achieve high level expression of human BACE in tobacco plants via chloroplast transformation. Following particle bombardment with the CtVBACE construct and after three rounds of selection, four transplastomic tobacco lines were obtained. Western blot confirmed that plastid-derived BACE protein was recognized by an antibody specific to human BACE, and ELISA analysis estimated BACE protein accumulation in transgenic lines at approximately 2.0% of TSP. This is much higher than the BACE yield from nuclear transformed potato tuber or tomato fruit, estimated at 0.12\u20130.19% of TSP (Youm et al. unpublished data). However, the level of plastid-based BACE accumulation achieved in this study is lower than what can be expected from chloroplast transformation. The chimeric CTB-2L21 protein was accumulated in tobacco chloroplasts to levels up to 31.1% of TSP (Molina et al. 2004), and the tetanus fragment C toxin to levels of 10\u201325% of TSP (Tregoning et al. 2005). Furthermore, PA/g for anthrax was accumulated in plastid-transformed plants at levels up to 2.5 mg g\u22121 fresh weight (Watson et al. 2004). However, other antigens such as FMDV VP1 protein (2.0\u20133.0% of TSP [Li et al. 2006a, b]), HPV L1 (up to 1.5% of TSP [Lenzi et al. 2008]), and SARS-CoV S1 protein (approximately 0.2% of TSP [Li et al. 2006a, b]) accumulated in transplastomic plants at levels that were similar to, or lower than, those achieved for BACE protein in our study. These markedly different expression levels may be due to the type of antigen being expressed, post-transcriptional events and/or protein stability in plastids. Herz et al. (2005) reported that protein expression in the plastid depended on several factors including the types of transformation vectors, promoter and translational control elements used, and external factors like plant age or light intensity. Therefore, the levels of BACE expression achieved in this study may be attributable to some of these various factors.",

From this result, we could estimate that the protein size of the chloroplast-derived BACE was not changed due to post-translational process. Chloroplasts have the ability to process eukaryotic proteins, including correct folding of subunits and formation of disulfide bridges (Staub et al. 2000; Daniell et al. 2001b), result in fully functional recombinant protein.
