Random cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Primer pairs for the molecular detection of astrovirus in Korean bats were described previously by Chu et al. [18]. The primers for hemi-nested RT-PCR (for first PCR, AS1-F1: GARTTYYGATTGGRCKCGKTAYGA; AS2-F1: GARTTYGATTGGRCKAGGTAYGA; AS-R: GGYTTKACCCACATNCCRAA; for second PCR, AS3-F1: GCKTAYGATGGKACKATHCC; AS4-F2: AGGTAYGATGGKACKATHCC; AS-R) target a partial region of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene in astrovirus, which has a length of 422 bp. Amplification was performed using the Platinum Green Hot Start PCR master mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols; briefly, both PCRs were performed at a final volume of 50 \u00b5l containing 10 \u00b5l forward and reverse primers, 2.5 \u00b5l cDNA, and PCR master mix (2\u00d7). Sequences were amplified under the following conditions: initial incubation at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 68 \u00b0C 30 s, with a final extension at 68 \u00b0C for 5 min in a Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The amplified 422-bp products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pTOP V2-TA plasmids (Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea) for DNA sequencing. Three clones from the PCR products were selected and sequenced using BigDye 1.1 terminator cycle sequencing reagents on an ABI PRISM 3130 Automated Capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). For the amplification of a partial region of ORF2 (capsid protein), primers were designed against a conserved region following alignment of available astroviral sequences. The following primer sets were used: for the first PCR, cap523F: TYACNCCTATGGTTGG; cap1290R: TRTTRTTYTGAGCATC; and for the second PCR, cap523F; cap1193R: CAAACCACCANCCACC. Amplification was performed under the following conditions: initial incubation at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 40 s, annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 40 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 40 s, with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min in a Mastercycler. The final 670-bp amplicons were purified and sequenced as described above.",

In a previous study, the amino acid similarity of the RdRp gene within bat astroviruses in Asia and Europe was verified to be ~49.2% [26, 28]. In this study, the amino acid identity of the partial RdRp gene in Korean bat astroviruses ranged from 46.6\u2013100%, and the amino acid identity of astroviruses within a single bat species captured from the same habitat also ranged from 53.4\u2013100%. Moreover, the amino acid identity of multiple astroviral strains from within an individual bat was 50.8\u2013100%. This amino acid identity range within multiple clones of bat astroviruses indicated the existence of astrovirus haplotypes in Korean bats; the very low amino acid identity may indicate the possibility of infection by two or more astrovirus species in individual bats, or hyperpolymorphisms within identical astrovirus strains; however, more systematic studies and more genomic sequences are needed to verify this. Additionally, astroviruses are known to widely spread among Chiroptera and show no host restriction [15, 18, 25, 26]. Our result showed that astrovirus sequences in multiple clones from one M. fuliginosus bat were closely clustered with bat astroviruses from different host species: M. macrodactylus and R. ferrumequinum. In group D, the clustering between M. fuliginosus (BtAstV-BT54-1) and R. ferrumequinum (BtAstV-BF67-2) showed an amino acid similarity of \u2265 99%; this was supported by high posterior probabilities (pp = 0.99) from phylogenetic topology. These phylogenetic results suggest that genetic variants were generated at high rates within individual bats, and that active transmission events between bat species or families occurred between the Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families. Furthermore, of the available astrovirus sequences, the partial amino acid sequence of ORF2 from two bat astroviruses was confirmed to have the highest identity (73.3\u201374.8%) with the bat astrovirus LC03 (FJ571074) and LS11 (FJ571067) sequences from China. It is unclear whether these represent novel astrovirus species according to ICTV guidelines [29], as we could not characterize the entire ORF2 sequence. Therefore, further studies on the characterization of the whole genomes of bat astroviruses is necessary, as Korean bat astroviruses have not been comprehensively analyzed until now.",

Accordingly, a high concentration and high prevalence of astrovirus was found in the samples collected during spring and autumn, indicating that they were most susceptible in the periods before and after parturition [28]. Our results showed that the prevalence of astrovirus in Korean bats was at its maximum during spring, the period before parturition, and before the rainy season.
