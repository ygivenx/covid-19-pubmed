Furthermore, viruses such as influenza A and B, parainfluenza (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (AdV) often cause more severe manifestations in immunocompromised individuals, including solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) [3]. While influenza infection is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent populations [4], there are fewer data on the other viruses that cause respiratory infection in SOTRs. In recent decades, more effective and sustained immunosuppressive therapy has been developed and incorporated into antirejection regimens, decreasing the incidence and degree of rejection episodes in this population [2]. However, simultaneous with enhanced immunosuppression is the increased risk for infection, including that due to respiratory viruses.",

For example, among lung SOTRs, the incidence of RVIs in published reports ranges from 1.4% to 60%, likely due to the heterogeneity of the types of patients screened, including whether patients are symptomatic or asymptomatic at the time of screening [5,6]. Furthermore, most studies may select for cases of more severe disease by including only hospitalized patients or those being seen by a healthcare provider in the outpatient setting. Patients with milder respiratory symptoms may be less inclined to seek medical attention. Another problem is that even those hospitalized with respiratory infection may not undergo appropriate procedures to make a diagnosis. Until recently, identifying specific respiratory pathogens was difficult, given the similarity in clinical presentation among potential pathogens and the time-consuming nature of available microbiologic techniques such as cell culture or serologic assays. Molecular diagnostics now available in most laboratories can provide more rapid and reliable diagnoses compared to older techniques including antigen detection [3,7,8]. In addition, molecular diagnostics have led to the identification of respiratory tract viruses not previously recognized to be common or important pathogens, including, for instance, bocavirus, certain enteroviruses and coronaviruses [8,9].",

Aside from perhaps PIV, RVIs in SOTRs tend to parallel the seasonal nature of infections in the immunocompetent [3,10,11]. However, SOTRs may have atypical presentations, including few or no symptoms at onset with subsequent progression to severe life-threatening disease [3,10,12\u201315]. SOTRs may also shed virus for very prolonged periods of time even in the absence of symptoms and thus can spread viruses nosocomially to a greater degree, with potentially devastating consequences to other hospitalized SOTRs [16,17]. Co-infection with bacteria and fungi are also more commonly seen in transplant recipients with RVIs [18].",

Even so, it is important to identify the presence of specific viruses to determine if antiviral therapy may benefit a patient. In addition, decreasing immunosuppression may be feasible in order to speed up the resolution of a viral infection, and appropriate isolation precautions must be instituted in the hospital setting to limit spread [17]. As noted above, molecular diagnostics are a mainstay of diagnosis of RVIs, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using multiple primer pairs to detect a variety of different target sequences can be an efficient and cost-effective means for diagnosis [2,3,9,19]. Of note, Preikasaitis et al. recently demonstrated the feasibility of patient-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnosis of RVI in SOTRs [20].",

In addition, respiratory viral infections are thought to be a risk factor for the development of rejection and/or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) among lung SOTRs, although this is not consistently demonstrated in the literature [5,11,22\u201324]. A cohort of 100 lung transplant recipients, 50 with RVI and 50 without RVI, was followed for 3 months and demonstrated an acute rejection rate of 16% in the RVI group compared to 0% in those without RVI, and greater decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) in the RVI group [23]. However, in a pooled analysis, Vu et al. (2011) were unable to confirm the link between acute rejection and RVI and there were not sufficient numbers to assess the association of RVI and BOS [5]. McCurdyet al. reported no association between RVI treated with ribavirin (RBV) and BOS [25]. Fuehner et al., however, found a protective effect of RBV treatment among lung SOTRs who received the drug for paramyxovirus infection (5% BOS among RBV recipients, 24% BOS among non-RBV recipients, p = 0.02) [26]. Finally, a recent prospective cohort study of 98 lung transplant recipients demonstrated that RVIs were significantly associated with acute rejection and a decline in lung function at 1 and 3 months [6]. Definitive assessment of the association between RVIs and acute and chronic rejection will require further study with larger cohorts of patients.",

In general, all SOTRs suspected of having an RVI should have a nasopharyngeal swab, wash, or aspirate obtained and sent for rapid testing, ideally with PCR-based assays using nucleic acid amplification that can detect a broad range of respiratory pathogens [3]. Culture, antigen detection, and serology have largely been replaced by more sensitive PCR methods. Multiplex PCRs, which are widely used by most transplant centers [27], identify a variety of pathogens not detected by conventional methods [3,8] but may vary in sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AdV [3,7,28]. Quantitative AdV PCR from blood may also be obtained to aid in diagnosis. The features and possible pharmacologic therapies for important non-influenza RVIs in the SOTR population are discussed below and summarized in Table 1.\n",

AdV causes a variety of usually self-limited infection manifestations in immunocompetent individuals, and AdV is more common in children in both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations. Certain AdV serotypes have a predilection for causing pulmonary infection, including subgroups B1 (serotypes 3, 7, 16, 21, 50), B2 (serotypes 11, 14, 34, 35), C (serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6), and E (serotype 4) [29]. Immunocompromised patients can become ill from newly acquired infection or reactivation of latent virus from prior infection [14,29,30]. AdV infection in SOTRs typically occurs within the first year after transplant [14,29,31] and tends to cause more frequent and severe disease in lung transplant recipients [29,32]. Humar et al. reported finding AdV in 19 of 263 SOTRs (7.2%) [14], although none were lung transplant recipients. Viremia was universal and some were asymptomatic. All patients in this cohort recovered from their infection with no consequences. In a cohort of lung transplant recipients, the reported incidence of AdV infection was 22.5%, with most being asymptomatic and no association with rejection or decline in pulmonary function [31]. However, others have reported pediatric and adult SOTRs with severe necrotizing pneumonia (Figure 1) and AdV-associated mortality [13,14,32\u201334]. Patients who receive antilymphocyte antibodies are at an increased risk of developing AdV infection, and an increase in AdV-specific T lymphocytes has been associated with resolution of AdV in blood and lungs [35,36].\n",

Therefore, the mainstays of therapy for AdV pneumonia are reduction in immunosuppression and supportive care [30]. However, cidofovir, a cytosine analog that interrupts AdV replication in vitro, is often used for treatment of more severe infections [30,33,35]. The intracellular diphosphate form of cidofovir acts as an AdV DNA polymerase substrate that is preferred over other cellular substrates, and cidofovir possesses in vitro activity against all AdV serotypes [30,37,38]. No prospective controlled trials have been conducted using cidofovir for AdV infection, and its efficacy remains uncertain. Data come from non-randomized series and case reports (mostly in hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] recipients [HSCTRs] and for various sites of infection including cystitis and enteritis), with varying results including failures [39] as well as clearance of viremia and possible mortality benefit [13,33,40\u201344]. Monitoring AdV PCR viral load may help in assessing recovery [45], although case reports have also reported apparent early clinical and virologic improvement with subsequent respiratory failure and death [16,33]. Some centers, particularly those caring for pediatric HSCTRs, may perform regular AdV blood PCR for preemptive monitoring, with initiation of cidofovir at the onset of viremia to try to prevent disease [39].",

Once intracellular, cidofovir is released and does not easily get removed from the cells [38]. It has in vitro activity against numerous double-stranded DNA viruses and, unlike cidofovir, is not a substrate for organic anion transporter 1, which causes cidofovir accumulation in renal tubules, so BCV lacks the severe nephrotoxicity of cidofovir [47]. BCV received Fast Track status by the FDA for AdV infection, and enrollment was recently completed for a phase 3 clinical trial of BCV in several cohorts: (1) HSCTRs with asymptomatic or limited AdV infection; (2) HSCTRs with disseminated AdV infection; and (3) other immunocompromised patients with AdV infection (the AdVise Study) [38,48]. The primary outcome of the study was 24-week mortality. This open-label non-randomized study included patients aged 2 months to 75 years, and BCV was administered twice a week for 12 weeks [48]. Preliminary data from HSCTRs have demonstrated mixed results. There were improved outcomes in pediatric patients compared to adults with disseminated infection (19% mortality vs. 43% mortality, respectively), and a rapid decline in viral load was noted for many patients as well as improved overall survival among those with an antiviral response [49]. However, BCV was discontinued due to adverse events (primarily gastrointestinal) in 20% of pediatric and 29% of adult subjects [49], and there was no difference in survival between those treated with BCV compared to historical controls, a finding that investigators believed was due to baseline differences in the two cohorts [50].",

As described above, there are a small number of case series that report the use of IVIG and/or palivizumab in combination with RBV, but antibody therapy has not been studied as a stand-alone treatment [58,64,66]. RSV\u2013IVIG was removed from the market in 1998 due to the introduction of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion (F) protein. It is FDA-approved for the prophylaxis of RSV in high-risk infants during RSV season [77]. As above, Liu et al. and Aziza-Heredia et al. reported giving palivizumab in combination with RBV \u00b1 IVIG and/or methylprednisolone [58,64]. Grodin et al. reported the successful treatment of a 70-year-old heart transplant recipient who received one dose of palivizumab (7.5 mg/kg = 900 mg) in combination with aerosolized RBV, IVIG, and methylprednisolone [78]. Palivizumab prophylaxis is frequently given outside of RSV season to pediatric SOTRs (93% of centers give to infants up to 12 months and 79% to infants up to 24 months) [79], although it has not been studied for this indication. Motavizumab (MedImmune, LLC/AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) is a second-generation humanized monoclonal antibody with ~70-fold higher affinity for the RSV F protein and 20-fold greater neutralizing capacity than palivizumab [80]. When compared to palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk children, motavizumab demonstrated 26% fewer RSV-associated hospitalizations and a 50% decrease in outpatient RSV LRTIs [81]. Concerns about increased nonfatal hypersensitivity reactions led the FDA to deny the drug\u2019s licensed approval, and development for that indication has ceased [82]. A recent report described the use of high-titer anti-RSV neutralizing antibody (RI-001, ADMA Biologics, Inc, Ramsey, NJ) for the treatment of 15 patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and RSV LRTI [83]. Eleven of 15 patients survived, and survivors had a shorter time from RSV diagnosis to initiation of RI-001.",

There are significantly fewer data on PIV infection in SOTRs compared to HSCT recipients, and most data in SOTRs are in lung transplant recipients. A review of 32 PIV infections in 24 lung transplant recipients over 10 years revealed that infection occurred a median of 2 years after transplant (range 0.6\u20135 years); respiratory failure developed in 21% and BOS in 32% [98]. Most infections were caused by PIV-3; this type also causes the majority of infections in HSCTRs [26]. URTI is the most common manifestation although it can progress to LRTI, resulting in fatal infection; there was an 8% mortality in the review of lung transplant recipients noted above [98].
