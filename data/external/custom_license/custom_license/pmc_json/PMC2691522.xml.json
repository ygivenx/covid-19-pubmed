The behavior of the general population or specific risk groups can play an important role in both the spread and control of infectious diseases. The SARS epidemic showed the impact of worldwide travel on the rapid spread of an epidemic, as well as the possible merits of strict hygiene and quarantine measures in halting that epidemic [3]. In case of an infectious disease pandemic, public health authorities will be dependent on the willingness and ability of the general public to adhere to recommendations regarding personal hygiene, vaccination and/or prophylaxis, quarantine, travel restrictions, or closing down of public buildings such as schools [4, 5]. Compliance with recommended precautionary behaviors is not self-evident [6]. Specific attention to factors influencing behavioral change during outbreaks of infectious diseases is, therefore, necessary.",

Perceived vulnerability, combined with perceived severity, can be regarded as perceived threat. People are expected to have the highest perceived threat of SARS if they think that an infection with SARS is likely and will have serious health consequences. However, risk perception is certainly not the only determinant of protective behavior. Protection Motivation Theory suggests that response efficacy (i.e., the extent to which people believe that available protective actions against SARS are effective) and self-efficacy (i.e., the extent to which people believe they have the ability to engage in such protective actions) are two other key predictors of protection motivation [8].",

Related to emerging infections diseases, first, explorative and descriptive studies are needed to increase our insights in perceived threat, risk perception, and efficacy beliefs. Such studies can inform more focused and theory-driven investigations. During and in the aftermath of SARS, several of such exploration studies have been conducted, but these studies did not include international comparisons across a range of different countries. These studies showed that the risk of SARS was perceived differently across the globe and was not directly linked to the proximity of the outbreak. Risk perception of SARS in some of the Asian countries was relatively low compared to risk perception in the USA [13\u201315] but similar to levels reported for The Netherlands [16]. One study focused on differences in psychosocial factors predicting preventive behavior in four affected regions [17]. Ji and colleagues compared optimism related to SARS in China and Canada and concluded that both groups demonstrated unrealistic optimism, while at the same time they were overly pessimistic about their own chances of getting infected [18]. A limited number of studies have looked at risk perception of avian influenza with different results varying from high perceived risks to low risk perception [19\u201322]. A Dutch study showed high levels of risk perception of avian influenza in case of an outbreak and indicated that almost 40% of respondents had taken some sort of precautionary measures [23].",

Because there was a large difference between how SARS has affected Southeast Asia and Europe, one might hypothesize that this would mean a higher risk perception of SARS and possibly other infectious diseases in countries in Southeast Asia. If international differences in risk perceptions of SARS exist, the question is whether such differences are specific for SARS, whether we see the same for risk perception of avian influenza (as most cases have also occurred in Southeast Asia), or whether they may indicate a more general trend in risk perceptions.",

For SARS and flu, the respondents first received a brief explanation (for SARS, \u201cSARS is a severe acute breathing related illness caused by a previously unknown virus\u201d; for flu, \u201cA new type of flu virus can arise from avian flu, it causes serious illness and spreads easily in the population\u201d). Respondents were then asked about:\nSeverity (\u201cHow serious (on a scale from 1 to 10) would it be for you if you got [disease] in the next year?\u201d);Vulnerability (\u201cHow likely do you think it is that you will develop or contract a [disease] in the next year; very unlikely (1) to very likely (5));Comparative vulnerability (\u201cHow likely do you think it is that you will develop or contract [disease] in the next year compared to other [women/men] of your age in [own country]; much less likely (1) to much more likely (5)).\n\n",

To make the scores comparable, the severity score was first divided by two. To normalize the skewed distribution of the new variable, a square root transformation was performed that resulted in a measure of perceived threat on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high). A SARS knowledge score (scale 0\u20132) was calculated based on whether the respondent could name a symptom of SARS and whether the respondent knew SARS was a communicable disease. Differences in background characteristics (gender, age group, area, and level of education) and risk perceptions between the samples in Europe and Asia were explored with chi-square tests or (paired) Student\u2019s t tests, of which the p value and the effect size r are reported.

This indicates that these potential problems were taken very seriously by the general public.",

Comparing our results with data from several earlier studies on risk perception of SARS in the USA, Canada, The Netherlands, Singapore and Hong Kong has its limitations, as these studies were done in 2003 during the SARS epidemic, whereas in our study, we asked respondents to envisage a new outbreak [13\u201316]. For example, in 2003, risk perception of SARS in some of the Asian countries was relatively low compared to risk perception in the USA. Ji et al., in their study on optimism across cultures, have pointed out that unrealistic optimism concerning SARS was higher among Chinese than among Canadians [18]. They interpreted this being in line with the Chinese and East Asians in general holding a cyclical perception of events, so that a negative event may be seen as antecedent to a positive outcome.",

Preventive measures in Asia were also more visible and might have been more reassuring to the public [2]. Also, efficacy beliefs related to a common cold and flu from a new virus were higher in Asian countries where the latter may be explained by the fact that, despite the first cases of avian influenza among humans in Asia already reported in 2003, this has not resulted in a larger outbreak [22].",

This result is also in line with a lower risk perception of SARS among Finns compared to Dutch [24, 30]. One of the explanations for this tendency is that the media in Scandinavia appear to report more about risks abroad with less attention to risk inside the country [29]. However, we need to interpret the differences between countries with care because cognitive constructs such as risk perceptions are not necessarily interpreted in the same way in different cultures [31]. Indeed, the data of our study on comparison of risk perceptions for various diseases show that the relative risk perceptions for these diseases, i.e., the order of levels of risk perceptions, are rather consistent across countries. This may indicate that differences between countries in absolute risk perception levels for specific diseases or conditions may reflect cultural differences in the way survey questions are answered rather than real differences in risk perceptions. Voeten et al. [32], in their study on risk perception and efficacy beliefs among Chinese communities in the UK and The Netherlands, have shown that efficacy beliefs of Chinese living in the UK and The Netherlands were comparable to those of native UK and Dutch respondents. This may indicate that country of residence, perhaps because of country-specific public health systems and media coverage, may be more important than ethnicity or country and culture of origin. Because country appears to be a relevant correlate of SARS-related risk perceptions in the multivariate analyses, further research is needed to explain these country differences.",

The notion that, for an outbreak, risks were perceived to be more evenly distributed, and thus they seemed to be less prone to an optimistic bias, may offer starting points for public interventions. Such interventions should certainly also focus on increasing self-efficacy, especially in the European countries, because low self-efficacy may lead to lack of protection motivation.",
