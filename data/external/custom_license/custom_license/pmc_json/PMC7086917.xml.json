Numerous strains and serotypes of IBV have been, and continue to be, discovered in poultry flocks worldwide [1\u20136]. This genetic and antigenic diversity demonstrates the capacity of IBV to mutate extensively while maintaining the integrity of its large, single-stranded RNA genome. Mutations and recombination at various locations throughout the IBV genome are believed to modify tissue tropism and antigenicity [7\u201312] and are the main mechanisms responsible for the evolution of new coronaviruses that infect the same, or new, host [13, 14].",

            "text": "Historically, Australian IBV strains were typed into 9 distinct groups based on cross-neutralisation assays [15]. Australian IBV strains detected prior to the 1980\u2019s, including Australian vaccine strains, were termed \u2018classical\u2019 IBV strains. These strains share common features, including tropism for both kidney and respiratory tract tissue, along with limited antigenic and S1 amino acid sequence variation (between 1 and 25%) (the IBV S1 gene forms the epitope on the surface of a mature virion particle and is transcribed as part of gene S). Between 1988 and 1994, Ignjatovic et al. [16] discovered a group of IBVs that were substantially different to \u2018classical\u2019 IBVs. These IBVs showed tropism for the respiratory tract only, no antigenic similarity with \u2018classical\u2019 strains and S1 sequence variation of greater that 44% [16, 17]. These new viruses were subsequently termed \u2018novel\u2019 IBV strains. In 2002, another group of antigenically different IBV strains was identified in Australia [18]. These viruses evolved through recombination between \u2018classical\u2019 and \u2018novel\u2019 strains [20]. Therefore, a new naming system was adopted for Australian IBVs to accommodate these established antigenically diverse groups while at the same time allowing for future isolation of new subgroups of IBVs. This naming system defines \u2018classical\u2019, \u2018novel\u2019 and 2002 strains as Australian IBV subgroup strains 1, 2 and 3, respectively [18]. These subgroups were characterised further by Hewson et al. [19] in 2009.",

Australian IBV strains that do not have a high S1 gene sequence identity to any current subgroups are classified as \u2018other\u2019 [19].

Non-structural accessory protein genes 3 and 5 are polycistronic and encode proteins 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b [21, 22]. Gene 3 also encodes 3c, which has been identified as the structural envelope protein, E [21, 23, 24]. This typical organisation of coronavirus structural genes is also found in turkey coronaviruses (TCoVs) which are also group III coronaviruses that are genetically closely related to IBV. However, the genomic organisation of Australian subgroup 2 IBVs have been found to vary substantially from this typical gene organisation, and have been shown to be either S-X1-E-M-5b-N or S-X1-E-M-5b-N [25], where X1 represents a section of sequence that shows no homology to sequences from previously characterised IBVs. It has been shown, however, that the specific arrangement of these structural genes is unnecessary for the production of viable coronavirus particles [22, 26].",

Recently, the whole genome of TCoV was sequenced for the first time in two separate studies using three different strains of TCoV [29, 30], and two open reading frames (ORFs) (designated ORFs 4b and 4c) were discovered in this \u2018intergenic region\u2019 of TCoV [29]. Another ORF was also described, located between the N gene and 3\u2019UTR, and designated \u20186b\u2019. Both of these TCoV investigations compared the nucleotide sequence and location of the 4b, 4c and 6b ORFs (as designated in ref. [29]) with those of common international IBV strains, such as Beaudette and M41, and reported similar ORFs in analogous positions in the genomes of these IBV strains, but noted functional ORFs have not yet been reported in these regions of IBV. The presence of these ORFs has not been reported in Australian IBV strains, and only one investigation has examined differences present in the 3\u2019 UTR of Australian strains [31].",

The identity scores between the 4b ORF of TCoV and the 4b-like ORFs in Australian IBV strains (including subgroup 2 strains) suggested a genomic similarity between these ORFs, and these results, coupled with the similarity between the hydropathicity plots of their respective predicted proteins, suggest that their products would fold similarly and therefore retain similar properties. The presence of this complete ORF in many international and most Australian IBV strains, as well as the presence of a highly conserved region within this ORF, suggests an important functional role in IBVs. Although, to date, no confirmed functional ORF has been found between the M and 5a genes in IBV or TCoV, the findings of this study, combined with the conclusions drawn by Cao et al. [29] and Gomaa et al. [30], indicate that future investigations aimed at defining the function of the 4b-like ORF are warranted.",
