            "text": "Molecular methods have significantly improved the diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections [16, 18, 21]. These techniques offer high sensitivity and provide specific results within a shorter period of time and for a larger number of pathogens compared to classical methods such as virus isolation or direct fluorescent antibody tests. A recent study showed that multiplex PCR methods can simultaneously detect and differentiate up to 16 pathogens in one assay [12]. Various detection methods currently exist, including microsphere-based detection using Luminex platforms (xTAG RVP or ResPlex II), endpoint-melting curve analysis (FilmArray Respiratory Panel) and auto-capillary electrophoresis (Seeplex RV15 or RespiFinder 15). The biotechnology industry has generated ready-to-use kits to standardize and ensure the quality of detection assays. However, some of these techniques require contamination-prone post-PCR processing steps as well as additional technical equipment and are not applicable for high-throughput analysis. Alternatively, in-house multiplex real-time PCR assays have been successfully established by specialized laboratories [3, 13]. However, general laboratories, which are already equipped with real-time PCR technology, might favour commercial real-time PCR solutions because these assays can be easily implemented in routine practice without the need for additional technical equipment. Furthermore, the use of commercial solutions has increased the performance of general laboratories [7, 20]. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the excellent performance of multiplex PCR (e.g., xTAG RVP or ResPlex II), data on samples collected prospectively are rarely available for commercial multiplex real-time PCR assays. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses shortly after the peak of the 2009 influenza pandemic in Germany and to evaluate the performance of the fast-track diagnostics (FTD) respiratory pathogens multiplex real-time PCR assay.",

Informed consent was obtained from each participant or his/her legal guardian. Ethical approval was obtained from the Freiburg University Medical Center and the participating study centers. Specimens included pharyngeal samples, which were collected using flocked swabs (Copan, Brescia, Italy), nasopharyngeal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. All pharyngeal samples, which were collected at 10 different study sites throughout Germany, were immediately shipped overnight in universal transport medium (Copan) at ambient temperatures according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Copan). The remaining study center was located in Freiburg, and samples were immediately sent to the laboratory in Freiburg. All specimens were processed directly without further steps of dilution (see below).",

Aliquots of the specimens were stored at -70 \u00b0C. After nucleic acid extraction, samples were immediately subjected to multiplex PCR analysis using the FTD respiratory pathogens assay version 5-11/2009 (Fast-track Diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxemburg). The assay utilizes the 5\u2032 nuclease technology using differentially labelled fluorogenic probes and is composed of five individual multiplex one-step real-time PCR assays. In tube 1, real-time PCR assays for influenza virus A, influenza virus B, and brome mosaic virus (BMV) are combined; tube 2 contains assays for coronaviruses 229E, NL63, and OC43 and enterovirus/parechovirus; tube 3 contains assays for parainfluenza viruses 2, 3, and 4; tube 4 contains assays for parainfluenza virus 1, human metapneumovirus A/B (HMPV), and human bocavirus; and tube 5 contains assays for rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A/B (RSV) and adenovirus. Five microliters of the template was used for each of the five multiplex PCR assays. An internal control (BMV), which was included in the FTD kit, was added to each patient sample after nucleic acid extraction. An AgPath-ID One-Step PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was applied for PCR using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 50 \u00b0C for 15 min and 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 8 s and 60 \u00b0C for 34 s.",

Primer and probe sequences are available from the corresponding author (MP) upon request. These have been extensively validated and have demonstrated ultimate sensitivity (<20 RNA or DNA copies per PCR) when using in vitro-transcribed RNA or DNA plasmids (data not shown). To streamline diagnostics, all assays, including those for DNA targets, were carried out in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl using a QIAGEN OneStep PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A concentration of 1 \u03bcM of each primer and 0.5 \u03bcM of the probe were used. Reverse transcription and amplification were performed using a Roche LightCycler 480 II System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) under the following conditions: 30 min at 50 \u00b0C, 15 min at 95 \u00b0C, 45 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. The RNA bacteriophage MS2 (German collection of microorganisms and cell cultures, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) was used as an internal extraction/inhibition control as described elsewhere [6]. Briefly, 30 \u03bcl of MS2 (105 CFU/ml) was added to the lysis buffer before extraction. Positive (in vitro RNA transcripts or DNA plasmids of the respective target) and negative controls were used in each assay. Cycling threshold values <45 were considered positive. The original samples stored at -70 \u00b0C were re-extracted as described previously and immediately subjected to monoplex real-time PCR. Up to 10 patients were analyzed in parallel in one working day for all 15 pathogens by using real-time PCR in two consecutive runs.",

In addition, this combination also showed excellent concordance (k = 0.89). Parechovirus-specific PCR was performed on samples (n = 8) that were determined to be enterovirus/parechovirus-positive by FTD and/or enterovirus-positive by monoplex PCR. Only 1 out of these 8 samples tested positive for parechovirus (Table 4). Notably, the FTD rhinovirus assay appeared to be more sensitive than the reference monoplex PCR. To further assess FTD rhinovirus-positive samples, sequencing part of the VP1 region of a subset of FTD multiplex-positive/monoplex-negative (n = 5) and FTD multiplex-positive/monoplex-positive (n = 8) samples detected the presence of rhinovirus C in 12 (92 %) of 13 samples, indicating restricted target specificity of the reference assay. Rhinovirus A was detected in 1 (8 %) of 13 samples. Interestingly, 4 (2 %) of the 43 FTD rhinovirus-positive samples showed cross-reaction with the FTD enterovirus/parechovirus PCR (Table 4).\n\n",

            "text": "This prospective study showed that the FTD multiplex real-time PCR assay could detect 16 respiratory pathogens within a response time of 2.5 hours. Test costs per sample (excluding enzyme costs) of the FTD assay were 22.63 \u20ac, whereas test costs of individual monoplex PCR were 5.41 \u20ac. This unique assay also showed high specificity and sensitivity. The three most common pathogens yielded sensitivities of >94 %, indicating excellent performance. Compared to a microsphere-based assay (xTAG RVP Fast), a higher overall sensitivity (92.2 %) was reached [11]. A recent study evaluating the FTD assay found considerably lower sensitivities for selected targets (i.e., adenovirus, rhinovirus, and RSV) [22]. The authors speculated that competitive inhibition of multiple targets may have led to this finding. For some rhinovirus strains, clear dropouts were recorded, similar to our findings, as discussed below. Anderson and colleagues demonstrated good overall concordance between four multiplex PCR assays, including the FTD assay, in a recent study from New Zealand [1]. This suggests that the FTD assay is widely applicable. The results of this study highlight the importance of evaluating the performance of the assays in the epidemiological context of their intended use.",

Faux et al. recently reported a high degree of variability among different PCR assays for the detection of rhinovirus [9]. The current study showed that detection of the novel rhinovirus C did influence the performance of the reference, thus supporting the findings of Faux and colleagues. Application of a third reference test facilitated the resolution of samples that showed discrepant results. Of note, a number of false-positive results were observed for bocavirus. This finding has also been reported by Anderson et al. [1]. Further analysis with members of distinct bocavirus species and strains as well as different sample matrices is warranted. In general, nonspecific amplification using the FTD assay was associated with significantly higher cycle threshold values, confirming the results of Sakthivel et al. [22].",
