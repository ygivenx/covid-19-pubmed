            "text": "It is now widely admitted that actual genomes have a common ancestor (LUCA, Last Universal Common Ancestor). Their current diversity results from events that have modified genomes during evolution. While some of these events happen at the nucleotide level (point mutation, indel of few nucleotides), others [strand inversion, duplications, repetitions, transpositions and horizontal transfers (HTs)] may concern significant parts of the genome. It has been postulated that HTs (exchange of genetic material between two different species) were very frequent during the first stages of evolution and are essentially subsisting nowadays in prokaryotes (1\u20134). As a consequence, the detection of HTs appears crucial to the understanding of the evolutionary processes and to the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of exchange rate between species (5\u20139).",

            "text": "Genes from a given species are very similar to one another with respect to base composition, codon biases and short oligonucleotide composition (15,16,22\u201324). As a general rule, usage of oligonucleotides varies less along genomes than among genomes (24\u201327). In addition, it has been observed that transferred DNA retains (at least for some time) characteristics from its species of origin (8,14). These particularities are used alone or in conjunction to detect DNA transfers between species (8,12,13). Transferred DNA is consequently detected on the basis of some of its singularities with respect to the sequence characteristics of the recipient species. However, these techniques suffer several drawbacks and weaknesses (28\u201330) that led us to consider generalizing the above approach for the screening of atypical regions in sequences. In fact, the genomic signature that accounts for all possible biases in DNA sequences has been shown to be species-specific (26,27,31,32). The signature is approximately invariant along the genome in such a way that the species of origin of DNA segments as small as 1 kb could be identified with a surprisingly high efficiency by means of their signatures (25,27). As a consequence, the sequence signature may be most often (at least in bacteria) considered a valuable estimation of the genomic signature. Assuming that (i) transferred DNA fragments exhibit signature of the species they come from and (ii) recipient and donor signatures are different, the screening of local variations of signature along genomes is expected to reveal regions of interest where HTs might be located. In addition, the status of HT is strongly suggested if the signatures of these regions of interest are found close to the signature of other species.",

Genomes are consequently sampled by means of a sliding window with an appropriate size. In fact, it would be interesting to have windows the smallest as possible for highest sampling accuracy. However, intra-genomic variability of signature increases for small windows. In addition, variability depends on species and word length. Base composition (1-letter word), 2- and 3-letter words are poorly species-specific: they do not allow a good discrimination between species (25,27). As a general rule, the longer the words (up to 9-letter long), the higher the specificity of the signature (25,27,31). However, counts of long words in small windows are too low to allow a reliable estimation of the parameters. In our hands, the analysis of 4-letter words in a sliding window of 5 kb (with a 0.5 kb step) offers a good trade-off between reliability of count, file size and computational charge, whatever the species. In addition, a double-strand signature (called local signature thereafter) is computed for each window to get rid of variations induced by strand asymmetry (38\u201342).",

Although the vast majority of local signatures look mostly the same (believed to be instances of the recipient species signature), some of them may greatly differ. In order to avoid potential biases linked to these outliers, it has been subsequently decided to select typical local signatures on the basis of their similarities, observed after clustering. The underlying idea is that typical local signatures aggregate in few large groups, whereas outliers are found in small complementary groups at a great distance from the recipient genome signature. Groups were consequently determined with the K-means clustering tool, using every scheme of clusters between 3 and 8 for each species. Finally, the best scheme of clusters was obtained by a decision tree-based partition [CART algorithm (43)]. The purpose of the CART algorithm is to predict values of a categorical dependent variable (clusters of local signatures in this work, each signature being characterized by its distance to the estimated genomic signature) from one or more continuous and/or categorical predictor variables [the different clustering schemes (3\u20138 clusters) in this work]. The CART algorithm thus provides an optimal split between groups collecting signatures close to the estimated recipient genome signature and the others groups. For each species, a clustering scheme is selected (e.g. the 5-group clustering) and a partition offered (continued example: group 2 and 3 on one side; 1, 4 and 5 on the other). The recipient species signature is subsequently calculated as the mean of the signatures of the groups belonging to the partition with the smallest distance to the estimated genomic signature.",

All distances in a high dimension space seem to be comparable since they increase with the square root of the dimension of the space, whereas the variance of their distribution remains unchanged. In fact, the radius of the hyper sphere holding 99% of the signatures of our database is only seven times the nearest neighbor distance (smallest distance between two species).

The SPBc2 sequence is the only foreign sequence identified in B.subtilis, using homology as criterion (BlastN, with parameters set to default). In fact, Blast analysis of B.subtilis outliers leads to contrasted results. Besides SPBc2 and 7 out of 9 prophages imbedded in the genome, the only atypical regions identified are those containing the 30 rRNA genes coded in B.subtilis genome.

Phylogenetic trees of protein or DNA sequences, unusual distribution of genes, nucleotide composition (including codon biases) are some of the HT features that are considered within the framework of these models (16,34), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (12,14,35) and Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA) (37) are some criteria that are currently employed. Each of the resulting models has its own advantages and caveats (28\u201330). As it has been recently pointed out by Ragan (49) and Lawrence and Ochman (50), each approach deals with a particular subset of HTs, being for example more efficient for detecting recent transfers, or more effective for the detection of ancient HTs. Our approach, which is clearly based on oligonucleotide composition, assumes that different species have different signatures but does not rely on any other assumption. It is not surprising, therefore, that the genomic signature approach provides results (in terms of % of DNA transferred) in reasonable agreement with those proposed by Garcia-Vallve (16) and Nakamura et al. (14) for the 22 species that were analyzed in common. Correlations between percentages of HTs found by these three methods are highly significant (R = 0.42, P = 10\u22123 and R = 0.62 and P < 10\u22124 between this work and Nakamura et al. and Garcia-Vallve et al., respectively; R = 0.40 and P = 2 10\u22123 between Nakamura et al. and Garcia-Vallve et al.).

The number of \u2018single vote\u2019 genes ranges from 116 for Garcia-Vallve (16) to 47 for Nicolas (12). A total of 470 genes make up the majority consensus set and we detected 453 of them, which is the best score of the five methods.

The number of detected HT genes is more than twice higher for Nakamura et al., whereas the part belonging to the majority consensus is the smallest (Table 3). Eleven genes are detected both by Garcia-Vallve and Nakamura (14,16) but not by our method; however, the small number of voters precludes any specific comment in this respect. The probable number of HT genes in H.influenzae would range between 11 and 273, with a \u2018reasonable\u2019 estimation around 60 (majority consensus of 57) (Table 3).",

Among the 4288 genes of E.coli, 1732 are detected at least once (40% of E.coli genes), but full agreement is only observed for 64 genes (1.5%) (Table 4, E.coli). Obviously, full agreement is expected to be small if voters are numerous. The majority consensus amounts to 342 genes. This number may provide a decent estimation of HT genes in E.coli. The approach of Lawrence (34) gets the greatest number of genes in common with the majority consensus (335 out of 342) at the price of a low specificity (Kappa = 0.43, Table 4), whereas Hayes' approach (35) gets the smallest number (186 out of 342). Our method detects 261 consensual genes, a score very close to the median score of the six methods (252). Four genes (Supplementary Material 7) are detected by all methods except ours. They are isolated and their lengths are \u223c750 nt. As already pointed out, our method is not suitable for the detection of short isolated HTs.",

Meanwhile, the percentage of outliers as reported by our approach rises to 20% and the percentage of \u2018single vote\u2019 genes reaches 24%. As expected, a high cut-off distance provides few single vote genes at the risk of missing some potentially transferred genes. Lowering the cut-off increases the proportion of single vote genes with the advantage of detecting most of the potential transfers (Supplementary Material 7). There is obviously a continuous grading in gene \u2018atypicality\u2019.

The comparison of recently diverged genomes (species or strains) provides the opportunity to find recent HTs, for which corresponding homologous genes in the donor species may be detected (52). Such a study is performed for five E.coli strains (two K12 strains: E.coli MG1655, E.coli W3110, one uropathogenic strain: E.coli CFT073, two enterohaemorrhagic strains: E.coli O157-H7 RIMD 0509952, E.coli O157-H7_EDL933) and two Shigella flexneri strains (S.flexneri 2a 2457T, S.flexneri 2a 301).

Considering that the genomic signature is species-specific, atypicality of a region in terms of oligonucleotide usage has been promoted as a criterion for the detection of HTs. However, atypicality-based methods suffer several caveats that reduce their effectiveness in such a way that only a part of HTs can be detected. In fact, transfers between species with close signatures cannot be detected: significant differences between characteristics of transferred DNA and recipient species DNA are required. For similar reasons, HTs that were drastically ameliorated following their introduction cannot be detected either (8,14). The most stringent constraint, however, results from the size of the screening window. On the one hand, ideally, the best signal-to-noise ratio would be obtained when windows and HTs have a comparable size. On the other hand, the window size must be large enough to provide significant word counts, a requirement that strengthens with the size of the words under consideration and the intrinsic variability of the genomic signature along the genome. All together, the trade-off that has been implemented in this paper allows detecting atypical regions as small as 1 kb. In fact, rRNA regions sharing this characteristic were consistently detected. It must be pointed out that smaller fragments can be eventually detected if their signatures are radically atypical.",

Accuracy of signatures, linked to the length of available sequences, density of signatures in the \u2018vicinity\u2019 of HT, amount of amelioration sustained by HT during its presence in the host are also of importance [P. Deschavanne, S. Lespinats and B. Fertil, unpublished results; (25,27,31)]. Distance between the signature of a putative HT and the closest species varies to a large extent, but usually the shortest ones fall within the intra-genomic range (Table 1, Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6). In some cases, the distance between the closest donor signature and the atypical segment signature is so great that no potential donor can be proposed (Supplementary Materials 1, 2, 4 and 6).",

Moreover, we must take into account the intrinsic variability of short DNA segment signature (which is a function of their size, but also species-specific) when compared with the signature of a complete genome or any other large species sample (25,27,31). In the present state, our signature database is in no way representative of the diversity and richness of life. However, it must be noticed that there is already an obvious structure (in terms of distances between signatures) expressing taxonomy relationships between species in our signature database (31,58\u201361).
