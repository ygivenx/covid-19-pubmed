            "text": "In May 2007, Gaynor and coworkers reported the identification of a novel virus in respiratory secretions from human patients with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. The virus was initially detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate collected from a 3-year-old Australian child diagnosed with pneumonia. Although its multiple DNA fragments shared limited homology with known polyomavirus, the genomic characteristics of these fragments were similar to those of members of the family Polyomaviridae, and the virus was therefore referred to as WU polyomavirus (WU virus) [1]. Since then, the detection and molecular characterization of WU virus in clinical respiratory specimens from patients with ARI have been reported in several articles [2\u20136], but the role that the virus plays as a respiratory pathogen remains to be determined [7].",

Among the 14 different polyomaviruses that have been described, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) are the only two known to productively infect and cause disease in humans [8, 9]. BKV has been reported to cause nephropathy, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic cystitis in immunosuppressed patients, and JCV has been linked to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised patients [10]. The mode of transmission for BKV and JCV has not yet been well defined. However, some of the evidence has suggested that respiratory transmission occurs. Sero-antibodies for both viruses are prevalent, and seroconversion occurs in childhood, as indicated by seropositive rates for BKV reaching 90% in children aged 5\u20139 years and for JCV, reaching 50\u201360% after the age of 10 years. Potential alternative modes of transmission for these viruses include urino-oral, transplacental transmission, and transmission by blood transfusion, semen and organ transplantation. Primary infections with BKV and JCV are typically subclinical or linked to mild respiratory illness and are followed by viral dissemination to the sites of lifelong persistent infection [11].",

Thirty-eight (5.6%) out of these 674 specimens yielded PCR products with the predicted molecular weight, using either screening or confirmation primer sets for WU virus, suggesting the presence of this recently identified WU virus in the respiratory tracts of infants and young children with ARI in Beijing, China. Although WU virus was also identified from specimens collected from children without symptoms of ARI, indicating that some WU virus infections might be asymptomatic, WU virus occurred 3.7 times more frequently in pediatric patients with ARI than in those without ARI (p < 0.05) in this study, suggested that WU virus is a kind of pathogen of ARI in Beijing children.",
