The type I interferon (IFN) genes, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are induced in response to viral infection via activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) transcription factors (Randall and Goodbourn 2008). These cytokines are then secreted from cells to act in an autocrine and paracrine manner through a common heterodimeric type I interferon receptor (IFNAR). Agonist\u2013receptor binding results in activation of transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) which, along with IRF9, form a heterotrimeric transcription factor complex known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to IFN-stimulated response elements to induce transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The cellular \u201cantiviral state\u201d is established through the combined functionality of ISG gene products. Several ISGs have direct antiviral functions while others modulate the immune system by activating effector cells and promoting the development of an acquired immune response.",

            "text": "Mammalian orthoreoviruses (reoviruses) are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with a genome consisting of ten double-stranded RNA segments (Tyler et al. 2001). Reoviruses have the capacity to induce apoptosis in both cultured cells in vitro (Clarke and Tyler 2003) and target organs in vivo (Clarke and Tyler 2009). Reoviral infection has served as a versatile model system for the study of viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity in the brain (encephalitis; Clarke et al. 2005), spinal cord (myelitis; Goody et al. 2008), and heart (myocarditis; Sherry 2002). The potential with which a given reovirus strain induces myocarditis is negatively correlated to its induction of, and sensitivity to, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Sherry et al. 1998). Furthermore, the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response is critical for myocardiocyte protection against reovirus replication both in vitro and in vivo (Sherry 2009). The importance of the IFN response in limiting reovirus replication and pathogenesis is also evidenced by in vivo models of peroral inoculation with reovirus serotype 1 strain Lang (T1L). For instance, systemic T1L infection and animal lethality is inhibited via IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 release from intestinal dendritic cells residing in Peyer\u2019s patches (Johansson et al. 2007). Similarly, IRF3 plays a role in restricting systemic T1L replication, limiting pathological changes in the heart, and preventing associated mortality (Holm et al. 2010).",

Reovirus infection of the brain (Tyler et al. 2010) and spinal cord (S.A.S., personal communication) is associated with increased expression of ISGs. The profile of ISGs induced in the brain during reovirus encephalitis is remarkably similar to that seen following infection of the brain with other neurotropic viruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) (Sharma et al. 2008) and dengue virus type 1 (Bordignon et al. 2008), suggesting a consistent host response to viral infections of the brain. We have previously demonstrated that, in brains infected with reovirus serotype 3 strain Abney (T3A), (STAT1) is phosphorylated at sites critical for its transcriptional activity (Goody et al. 2007). Mice lacking STAT1 demonstrate increased susceptibility to reovirus infection, increased mortality, and higher viral titers in the brain compared to wildtype controls. However, the role of IFN in virus-induced brain injury and disease was not described in these studies and the cause of death was not established. In the present study, we sought to directly assess the role of IFN in the virally infected host in terms of CNS-specific and -systemic viral replication/pathogenesis by utilizing ex vivo and in vivo models of reovirus infection.",

Mice lacking functional IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) have accelerated mortality and markedly increased viral titers in both brain and peripheral organs following reovirus infection. IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with T3 reovirus show an extended pattern of viral tropism in the CNS compared to congenic wildtype (B6wt) mice, as evidenced by the previously unreported capacity of the virus to infect neurons of the dentate gyrus and both ependymal and meningeal cells. We utilized a novel ex vivo brain slice culture system to reveal that IFN is produced locally in the CNS and does not depend upon extraneuronal aspects of viral infection (e.g., infiltrating inflammatory cells). This brain-derived IFN limits viral replication and reduces viral-induced apoptotic injury within the CNS. Overall, these data indicate that reovirus infection (both in vivo and ex vivo) induces a robust IFN response, which serves to restrict viral tropism, limit viral growth, and reduce consequent apoptosis within the CNS.",

Infection with either reovirus serotype induced significant upregulation of IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 1a) and IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 1b) transcripts in comparison to mock animals at 8 days post-infection (dpi). Compared to T1L-infected brains at 8 dpi, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction was significantly greater (p \u2264 0.027) in T3A-infected brains. Mx1 is a prototypical ISG, thus its expression serves as an indicator of functional IFN signaling. Mx1 mRNA was significantly elevated (p \u2264 0.044) in T3A-infected brains, in comparison to either T1L or mock samples at multiple time points (Fig. 1c). Compared to mock-infected brains, T1L-infected brains had significantly greater (p \u2264 0.036) expression of Mx1 only at 8 dpi. We previously demonstrated IFN and ISG induction by oligonucleotide arrays performed on RNA extracted from the brains of mice infected i.c. with reovirus serotype 3 strain Dearing (T3D; Tyler et al. 2010). Specifically, T3D infection induced expression of 8.7-fold greater IFN-\u03b2, 9.9-fold greater IFN-\u03b1, and 84.2-fold greater Mx1 in comparison to mock controls at 8 dpi. The magnitude of these effects is comparable to those seen following infection with T3A (Fig. 1a\u2013c). Taken together, these findings indicate that both T3 and T1 reoviruses initiate a functional IFN response in the host brain.\n\n",

In contrast to findings in liver and intestine, histological analysis revealed that the brains of T3-infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice appeared normal immediately prior to death (Fig. 4c) and had no evidence of apoptosis activation (data not shown). Infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice did not develop neurologic symptoms prior to death despite the fact that these experiments entailed direct brain inoculation of T3 reovirus, a highly neuropathogenic virus.

IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 and B6wt brains were harvested 4 days following infection with T3D (1,000 pfu) and the pattern of viral infection was examined by immunofluorescent staining of \u03c33 viral antigen. We have previously shown that, in wildtype mice, T3 reoviruses specifically infect neurons of the lateral thalamus, cingulate cortex, and CA3 region of the hippocampus (Oberhaus et al. 1997; Richardson-Burns et al. 2002). Consistent with these results, effective T3D infection of the CA3 is seen in B6wt animals by 11 dpi, but not as early as 4 dpi (Fig. 6a). In contrast, viral antigen is found in the CA3 of IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice by 4 dpi. At this time point, there is also evidence of reovirus antigen throughout the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. Dentate infection does not occur in T3D-infected B6wt mice even at late times post-infection when viral titer approaches 109 pfu/mL; thus, the presence of reovirus antigen in the dentate gyrus in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice is indicative of extended T3D tropism. Dual fluorescence imaging of reovirus antigen and NeuN neuronal marker confirmed that enhancement of viral replication in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice occurred specifically in neurons of the CA3 and dentate brain regions (Fig. 6b). These data indicate that IFN serves to limit T3 reovirus neurotropism in the brain. T1L does not normally infect neurons in wildtype mouse brains and neuronal tropism was not observed in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice following inoculation of T1L (data not shown).\n\n",

We showed that reovirus growth was significantly increased in slices derived from IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to slices derived from B6wt controls although the magnitude of this increase was not as dramatic as that seen in vivo. This discrepancy is likely due to viral reseeding that occurs in the intact animal, but not the ex vivo culture system. In addition, we saw an increase in Caspase 3 activity in reovirus-infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 brain slices compared to infected B6wt controls. We have previously demonstrated that apoptosis is a primary mechanism of neuronal cell death and tissue injury during reovirus encephalitis (Oberhaus et al. 1997; Richardson-Burns et al. 2002). Our results thus suggest that local IFN response within the brain is protective and serves to limit both viral growth and virus-induced tissue injury.",

Extended tissue tropism to the heart, intestine, stomach, lung, and kidney is seen following infection of IFNAR-deficient mice with MHV (Roth-Cross et al. 2008).

Particularly striking is the extended tropism of T3 reovirus strains to ependymal cells (Fig. 6). Early data suggested that T1L, but not T3 reovirus strains, induce hydrocephalus because T1 strains encode a unique viral hemagglutinin, which mediates high-affinity ependymal cell binding (Tardieu and Weiner 1982; Weiner et al. 1977). Our results demonstrate that in the absence of IFN, T3 reovirus strains can also infect and efficiently replicate within ependymal cells. In contrast, wildtype mice do not support reovirus infection within these cell types even at late time points post-infection when whole brain viral titers are in excess of 108 pfu/mL. Given these results, we conclude that T3 reovirus strains have the capacity to infect ependymal and meningeal cells; however, in the presence of the host IFN response viral replication is effectively inhibited in these cell types. Increased tropism to ependymal cells, in the absence of IFN signaling, has also been seen following infection of the brain with WNV (Samuel and Diamond 2005), Sindbis virus (Ryman et al. 2000), measles virus (Mrkic et al. 1998), TMEV (Fiette et al. 1995), and Semiliki forest virus (Fragkoudis et al. 2007). Taken together, our results and prior studies suggest that type I IFN plays a key role in protecting ependymal cells from infection by neurotropic viruses.",

Membranes were placed in 35 mm tissue culture dishes containing 1.2 mL serum containing media (Neurobasal supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 1\u00d7 B-27, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 400 \u03bcM l-glutamine, 600 \u03bcM Glutamax, 60 U/mL penicillin, 60 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, and 6 U/mL nystatin), such that slices were positioned at the media\u2013air interface. Immediately after plating, slices were infected with 106 pfu T3A or T3D per slice. Virus was diluted into 20 \u03bcl PBS and applied dropwise to the top (air interface) of each slice. Mock infections were performed in a similar manner with PBS alone. Media was refreshed with 5% serum-containing media (5% FBS) approximately 12 h after slicing. All subsequent media changes were made with serum-free media every 2 days (i.e., 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 36.5\u00b0C.",
