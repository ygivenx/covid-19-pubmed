A novel coronavirus has been identified as the etiological agent of SARS and been designated as the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3\u20137]. SARS-CoV contains a single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome approximately 30 kb in length, which typically has five major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the replicase (R) polyproteins, and the spike (S), the envelope (E), the membrane (M), and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins. SARS-CoV can infect African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells in vitro and experimentally cause a similar disease in cynomolgus macaques (macaca fascicularis) [8].",

Though real-time RT-PCR assays have a quantitative advantage and are reported to have higher sensitivity/specificity in some cases, the requirements of expensive reagents and special instruments are obstacles preventing their widespread use in ordinary laboratories. During the crucial time span of the SARS epidemic, a real-time RT-PCR assay was still being developed. Therefore, conventional nested RT-PCR still served as a practicable assay at the time. The method using BNI outer/inner primers was reported to have a lower cost but similar sensitivity and specificity compared to three in-house real-time RT-PCR assays [21]. We observed that simultaneous employment of the primers targeting both R (ORF 1b) and N regions of SARS-CoV could increase the method\u2019s detection sensitivity. This finding is identical to that contained in a previous report by Bressler et al. [16]. These authors suggested that the N gene is present in all of the sub-genomic RNAs of SARS-CoV instead of in only one of them (ORF 1b of the R gene). However, we believe the major reason might be that most of the SARS-CoV is not intact in clinical specimens. Thus, amplification of different regions of SARS-CoV will increase the chance of detecting the disintegrated virus genome.",

False-positive reactions were observed in four of the stool specimens. Therefore, all positive results from the stool specimens of the SARS patients were confirmed by sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products. In addition, 64 of the 108 positive samples were amplified and sequenced for the S gene of SARS-CoV, and we confirmed that all of these samples contained S gene fragments of SARS-CoV [22]. Employing various specimens may increase the detection rate for viral RNA. In the present study, viral RNA was detectable in 42.1% (8/19) and 61.3% (19/31) of patients with probable SARS during week 1 and week 2 of illness, respectively. In contrast, specific antibodies against SARS-CoV were detectable in 0% (0/22) and 50% (27/54) of patients in the same respective weeks. Therefore, viral RNA detection is particularly valuable for early-stage diagnostics. However, false-positive results have to be carefully excluded, especially for stool specimens. Employment of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected by professional physicians and use of qualified real-time RT-PCR assays may increase the method\u2019s sensitivity/specificity [13]. From week 2 following disease onset, serology is the gold standard for identifying true-positive cases, since SARS-CoV is new to humans and we commonly lack immunity against it.",

It is interesting, however, that viral RNA was detectable in both of these patients (i.e., in 1 blood cell sample of patient 14 and in 2 plasma samples of patient 22). Other investigators have reported that about half of their pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS failed to develop detectable antibodies specific against SARS-CoV [23]. Weak humoral immune response in pediatric SARS patients may be responsible for this unusual phenomenon. Since our observation of four other adult patients who did not seroconvert was terminated after 4\u20136 weeks of illness, and seroconversion can still occur during weeks 7 and 8 of illness [24], one possible explanation for the negative antibody detection results may be a delayed antibody response. It is also possible that the antibody response of some patients is below the sensitivity of the ELISA test. However, considering that the SARS diagnosis in our patients was based on clinical manifestations and characteristics on chest radiograph during an emergency situation, clinical misdiagnosis of the patients who were negative for SARS-CoV RNA cannot be excluded.",
