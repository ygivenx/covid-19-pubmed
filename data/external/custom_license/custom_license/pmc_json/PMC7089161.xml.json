The virus, designated 1-71, induced signs of gastroenteritis in neonatal dogs. Subsequently, it was isolated from other epizootics of canine diarrhea and was shown to have a worldwide distribution by serological surveys [2]. Today, CCV is generally considered to be an important etiologic agent responsible for mild to severe enteritis in young pups [3].",

On the basis of antigenic and genetic relationships [4, 5], CCV is classified as group I coronavirus within the family Coronaviridae, along with feline coronaviruses (FCVs) types I and II, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E). The genome of CCV, 27\u201332 kb in length, contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b. Those cover the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome and are known to encode two polyproteins participating in the viral replicase formation. Structural proteins S, E, M, and N encoded by ORFs 2, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, and a number of presumptive non-structural (nsp 3a, 3b, 3c, 7a, and 7b) proteins are located downstream of ORF1b [4].",

Since it was first identified in 1971, CCV has evolved and the characterization of some new mutants, such as Insavc-1, BGF, CB/05, and the divergent UWSMN-1, Elmo/02 strains, have been reported [10\u201314]. To date, two different CCV genotypes are known which have been designated CCV type I and type II on the basis of their genetic relationship to FCV type I and type II strains, respectively [14, 15]. CCV type I viruses, genetically more closely related to FCV type I viruses, have not been adapted to in vitro growth and differ from CCV type II viruses greatly.",

In the last three decades very little attention has been paid to CCV, and only a limited number of sequences corresponding to the C-terminal third of the genome are presently available. CCV 1-71, the first isolated CCV, is being used in many laboratories as a reference strain, and its pathogenesis has already been studied by virologic, histologic, histochemical, and immunoflurescent techniques [16]. Information about its genome and its phylogenetic relationship with other group I coronaviruses is, however, still unavailable.

Phylogenetic analyses, based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of S, E, M, and N proteins were conducted with both Phylip 3.6 software package [18] and MEGA4 program [19] using Maximum parsimony (MP) and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods, respectively.

In accordance with previous observations, the sequence of the spike protein had a higher similarity with FCV type II (\u223c96%) than with FCV type I and TGEV strains (\u223c52 and 91%, respectively). The N-terminus of the protein was much more variable than the C-terminus.

The residue Leu-44 was present only in CCV 1-71 and TGEV strains.

Alignment of this region with other CCV, FCV, and TGEV strains showed a high degree of variation. The nsp3a protein of CCV 1-71 was 87 amino acids long, 16-aa longer than that of all other strains due to the presence of a 47-nt deletion at position 206 of 3a gene and to a frame shift in the sequence downstream of the deletion. Another alteration caused by the deletion was the absence of the expected ORF3x designated initially by Horsburgh in 1992 [10]. An \u201cATTAC\u201d sequence was found near the both sides of the deletion region. Another large deletion (31-nt) was found in the expected ORF3b of CCV 1-71, causing the introduction of an early stop codon and the formation of two truncated ORFs, designated 3b1 and 3b2 (411 and 357 nt, respectively, Fig. 3).\n\n",

Several residues in the S protein, such as His-45, Ser-70, Asp-78, Thr-149, Ser-156, Ala-157, His-199, and Ser-394 that are unique for Chinese strains are also found in the S gene of CCV 1-71, which lends further support to this hypothesis. Despite the high sequence identity, two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mab N1-2 and N2-1) specific to the S protein of CCV 1-71 cannot prevent infection of susceptive cells with these Chinese strains [25]. This indicates that notable diversity in the antigenicity of S proteins exists. Minor amino acid changes in the sequence of the spike protein have already been demonstrated to alter the virulence or enteric tropism of even very closely related TGEV isolates [26]. Single amino acid substitution in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein has also been confirmed to determine viral entry and immunogenicity of a major neutralizing domain [27]. Analysis of the N-terminal 500 amino acids of the S protein of CCV 1-71 and CCV HF3 demonstrated several amino acid substitutions, such as Leu-44, N-245, S-314, L-373. Whether these substitutions can be responsible for changes in antigenicity and virulence remains to be investigated by analysis of more sequences or by using reverse genetics systems similar to those recently used for FIPV [28].",

The existence of the truncated ORF3b also indicates that this ORF is not essential for the viral replication. Significant changes in the same region have also been reported in many other coronaviruses like CCV-CB/05 [12], TGEV-TF1, TGEV-Purdue, and PRCV-ISU-1 [29]. The non-coding regions upstream and downstream of ORF3a were considered to be a \u201chot spot region\u201d where recombination, insertions or more usually deletions can occur at a high frequency [10]. Analysis of the deletion downstream of ORF3a in CCV1-71, CCV-CB/05 and TGEV-Purdue showed that an \u201cATTAC\u201d sequence existed close to the both sides of the deletion region, suggesting that the deletion may be caused by a recombination event. It is also possible that these deletions arose from \u201clooping out\u201d of RNA regions, which may further result in the \u201cskipping\u201d of viral RNA polymerases during transcription. The search for the transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) in the region between S gene and ORF3a showed a \u201cTTAAAC\u201d site, different from the expected \u201cCTAAAC\u201d, which is highly conserved in group I coronaviruses. Both the nucleotide sequence of TRS and the distance between the TRS 3\u2032-end and the initiation codon of first ORF are suggested to play an important role in the transcription of mRNAs [30]. The single nucleotide mutation in the TRS signal may reduce the transcription and expression of ORF3a. Unlike the intact nsp3b of the virulent CCV BGF10 strain, the nsp3b of CCV 1-71 is truncated in the middle of the sequence. Whether the two truncated ORFs (3b1 and 3b2) can be translated and whether the truncation is involved in changes of virulence need to be further studied. There are evidences in survey studies that the truncation of nsp3b is associated with attenuated strains [10, 31, 32]. Deletions in this ORF have also been suspected to play an important role in viral attenuation [33].",

This is the first report on the truncation of ORF7b in CCV. The same mutation via insertion was also found in the ORF3b gene of IBV strain Beaudette in which the ORF3b was truncated [34]. The region downstream of the N protein is another \u201chot spot region\u201d where insertions and deletions can happen frequently [10]. TGEV, for example, has a 69 nucleotides deletion in ORF7a and ORF7b is not present. Although it has been confirmed, by a targeted RNA recombination system, that the 7b glycoprotein of FIPV is nonessential in vitro for virus viability [28], a connection between gene 7 and virulence has been observed in FCV as deletions in ORF 7a and ORF7b are associated with a decrease in virulence [35]. Similarly, the abrogated expression of ORF7 in TGEV does not affect virus propagation but attenuates the virus in piglets [36]. Whether the truncation of ORF7b could also lead to an attenuation of CCV1-71 should be further investigated.",
