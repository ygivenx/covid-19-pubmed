In the 2014 article, the authors critically re-evaluated the VO2/DO2 relationship. Under normal conditions, oxygen uptake (VO2) is independent of oxygen delivery (DO2) because O2 extraction rapidly adapts to changes in DO2. However, VO2 can become DO2 dependent in acute circulatory failure. The VO2/DO2 relationship is thus a major parameter in guiding therapy of acute circulatory failure at the bedside, even though its application in past years may now be viewed as rather too\nsimplistic given present-day knowledge. Vincent and De Backer [1] summarize our current understanding of the VO2/DO2 relationship in critically ill patients in simple take-home messages. First, abnormal global VO2/DO2 dependency does not exist in stable, critically ill patients, including those with sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Secondly, abnormal global VO2/DO2 dependency does exist in severe cases of circulatory shock, when blood flow is significantly reduced, and it may exist globally in patients with septic shock and regionally in patients with severe sepsis. Thirdly, due to microcirculatory alterations, global determinations of VO2/DO2 are unfortunately insufficiently precise/sensitive to guide therapy effectively, and regional measurements cannot be obtained routinely in critically ill patients. Lastly, the study of the time-course of blood lactate levels may represent a surrogate for the evaluation of cellular oxygen deficit.",

Since publication of the latter article, weaning-induced cardiac dysfunction has been realized as an established cause of weaning failure, and relevant clinical research studies have made major contributions towards improving its diagnosis. Concepts have evolved greatly over the last 25 years, and present-day ICU physicians are well aware that weaning failure may be partially or completely due to an acute onset of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Efforts should be made not only to accurately diagnose cardiogenic pulmonary edema but also identify the mechanisms responsible for its development during weaning. Ongoing and future technological progress in ultrasonography and biomarker research will certainly help identify this condition.",

It is therefore not surprising that the proportion of elderly patients admitted to the ICU is increasing, even in circulatory shock. The usefulness of ICU admission in the aged population is a hot topic worldwide. Mortality rates are known to increase with age, but the impact of age on outcomes after circulatory shock has not been well defined. Biston et al. [7] explored this topic, performing a secondary analysis of data from a large randomized trial that compared the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine on outcome in the ICU. Mortality rates were higher in elderly (75\u201384 years) and very elderly (\u226585 years) patients at 28 days, at hospital discharge and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Most very elderly patients were dead at 6 (92 %) and 12 months (97 %). Mortality rates increased with age in all types of shock. Using multivariable analysis, the risk of death was higher in very elderly patients as compared to patients aged <75 years. In this analysis, ageing is independently associated with higher mortality rates in patients with circulatory failure, whatever the etiology. By 1 year after admission, most patients aged >85 years had died.",

Whether such phenomena can be observed in stable septic shock patients is presently not known. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that P[v\u2013a]CO2 can be substituted by the central venous-to-arterial CO2 difference (\u0394PCO2) in critically ill patients. Mallat at al. [8] tried to solve this conundrum by assessing the behavior of \u0394PCO2, an index of the CO2 production (VCO2)/CI ratio, in hemodynamically stable septic shock patients, but with ongoing signs of tissue hypoperfusion, given incremental doses of dobutamine. Twenty-two hemodynamically stable septic shock patients with no signs of global tissue hypoxia, with normal blood lactate levels, were enrolled in their prospective study. Despite a dose-related increase in CI and DO2, dobutamine infusion did not result in a dose-dependent decrease in \u0394PCO2, and VO2 and VCO2 showed a statistically significant increase in parallel with the increased doses of dobutamine. The authors concluded that the measurement of \u0394PCO2 may be a useful tool to assess the adequacy of oxygen supply to metabolic and oxygen demand.",

Early positive FB, especially at day 3, was found to be a robust and independent predictor of 90-day mortality, regardless of the primary diagnosis, acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal replacement therapy (RRT) use. In addition, these authors confirmed that AKI during ECMO is frequent and that those patients requiring continuous RRT are at greater risk of mortality. The conclusion drawn by the authors was that prospective studies of tight FB control over the first 5 days of ECMO are warranted.",

In the control group (122 patients), cooling was performed as usual, i.e. as soon as possible after hospital admission, whereas in the interventional group (123 patients) patients received an infusion of cold saline with external cooling during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Patients were included in the study whatever the initial rhythm, even though a large proportion of patients had a non-shockable rhythm. IATH did not have any significant effect on laboratory markers of inflammation and brain damage (neuron-specific enolase at 24 h) or on outcome, even though the target temperature was achieved earlier in the interventional group.

Following a GRADE-based systematic review, expert consensus was achieved using web-based Delphi methodology. The quality of evidence was low or very low for almost all of the 73 studies reviewed. A careful clinical neurological examination, with adequate time allowed to exclude confounding factors, remains the foundation for prognostication of the comatose patient after CA. The most robust predictors of poor prognosis are coma in patients with absent or extensor posturing at \u226572 h after CA (whether or not treated with MTH), bilateral absence of pupillary or corneal reflexes and bilateral absence of the N20 wave of somatosensory evoked potentials. Less robust predictors include status myoclonus, elevated neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 48\u201372 h, non-reactive electroencephalography (EEG) patterns after rewarming and neuroimaging evidence of diffuse post-anoxic injury. Prognostication using multiple variables is preferable but often limited by the shortage of relevant investigations and expertise. If the results of prognostic tests produce conflicting results or prognostication remains uncertain, further clinical observation and re-evaluation is recommended.",

The neuropeptide secretoneurin (SN) is specifically expressed in neuronal tissues and has multiple biological functions. It is upregulated by hypoxia and therefore has potential as a novel biomarker for hypoxic brain injury after CA. The prognostic value of SN was recently investigated in a prospective observational study of 134 patients admitted to an ICU after successful CPR following CA [12]. There was on average a sixfold increase in serum SN levels within the first 24 h after CPR, with significantly higher levels in patients with a poor neurological outcome compared to those with a good neurological outcome. SN predicted outcome earlier than NSE and is likely not influenced by MTH. It therefore has the potential to be a superior biomarker for early neurological prognostication after CA.",

Of the 7,238 cases of OHCA included in the registry over a 2-year period, 15 % were related to an extracardiac etiology and 85 % (6,165) were of cardiac origin. Of these patients, only 1,332 (22 %) were ultimately admitted to hospital alive. Initial rhythm was shockable in 26 % of cases, 58 % underwent coronary angiography and almost the same proportion was treated by therapeutic hypothermia. This study demonstrates that prognosis clearly remains very poor, since only 4.5 % of the patients with OHCA of cardiac origin (7.5 % of patients who actually underwent attempted resuscitation and 21 % of patients admitted alive) were discharged alive. Factors associated with prognosis were bystander CPR and initial shockable rhythm (increased survival), age, longer response time, occurrence of cardiac arrest at home and epinephrine dose of >3 mg during resuscitation (decreased survival).",

Daily sedation holds to allow the assessment of neurological function are recommended in all patients except those with reduced intracranial compliance. The Guidance highlights the importance of the Glasgow coma score (GCS) as a standardized, internationally recognized method for evaluating a patient\u2019s global neurological status. In association with the identification and documentation of localizing signs, such as pupil responses and limb weaknesses, the GCS remains the mainstay of clinical assessment 40 years since its first description. The main limitations of the GCS are that verbal responses are not assessable in intubated patients, and brainstem function is not directly considered. The Guidance recommends that four scores, which have been designed and validated to overcome these issues, can be used to differentiate yet further patients with a GCS of 3, although there is limited evidence that this approach has greater inter-rater reliability or prognostic value than the GCS alone.",

In 2014 the Neurocritical Care Society and ESICM published comprehensive and consensus-based Expert Guidance on multimodality neuromonitoring [34]. A systematic literature review of specific physiological processes that are relevant to the management of critically ill neurological patients was undertaken and used to formulate recommendations for individual monitoring techniques.

NCSz were identified in 16 % of these patients and periodic epileptiform discharges in 29 %. One-third of the patients with NCSz had non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), and all of these cases were septic. NCSz were independently associated with poor outcome. There is clearly an urgent need for large prospective studies to determine not only the exact prevalence and clinical impact of NCSz in critical care, but also to investigate whether treatment will improve outcome.

The mechanisms of ICUAW are multiple and not yet fully elucidated, but a disturbed balance of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the myopathy. To investigate this hypothesis further, Wollersheim et al. [37] measured MyHC synthesis and degradation in skeletal muscle in 29 critically ill patients at high risk of developing ICUAW. Open biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle for analysis of mRNA, protein content and cellular ultrastructure by electron microscopy was performed at a median time of 5 days after ICU admission. A second biopsy was performed in the 22 patients who were still in the ICU at a median time of 15 days after admission. Time-dependent changes in myofiber architecture and MyHC synthesis and degradation were correlated with Medical Research Council (MRC)-rated muscle strength. Control biopsies were obtained from aged-matched healthy patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery. ICU-acquired muscle wasting was characterized by early (day 5) disrupted myofiber ultrastructure and later (day 15) atrophy of slow- and fast-twitch myofibers. A decrease (compared to controls) in MyHC mRNA and protein expression was present at day 5 and persisted at day 15. This study supports the hypothesis that decreased synthesis and increased degradation of MyHC contributes to ICUAW and suggests that its pathogenesis is initiated very early after the onset of critical illness.",

Manual testing of muscle strength requires an awake, cooperative patient, and a comprehensive electrophysiological examination is both time-consuming and physically uncomfortable for awake patients. Moss and colleagues demonstrated that a simplified approach to the electrophysiological assessment of CIPNM, using a combination of unilateral peroneal (motor) and sural (sensory) NCS, has 100 % sensitivity and high specificity for the diagnosis of CIPNM [38]. These findings suggest that patients with normal peroneal and sural NCS are very unlikely to have CIPNM and that further testing with EMG is unlikely to alter that conclusion. However, if these NCS are abnormal, the diagnosis of CIPNM should be explored further with comprehensive electrophysiological investigations. This more streamlined approach to the diagnosis of CIPNM may facilitate routine diagnostic testing and monitoring of weakness in critically ill patients.",

There is also experimental evidence that lactate is neuroprotective after acute brain injury. In a recent prospective study, multimodal brain monitoring was used to investigate the metabolic and hemodynamic effects of exogenous administration of hypertonic sodium lactate in 15 patients with severe TBI [39]. Lactate administration resulted in a statistically significant increase in cerebral microdialysis-monitored concentrations of lactate, pyruvate and glucose, with a concomitant reduction in glutamate and ICP.

[40] recommended that glutamine should be administered intravenously (IV glutamine) to patients requiring parenteral nutrition except if they suffer from organ failures involving liver or kidneys. They also suggested that supplemental n-3 fatty acids (10 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids) be continuously administered enterally in patients suffering from ARDS as this has been associated with improvement in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio (ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen) and a decrease in the length of ventilation. Nevertheless, when administered in larger doses and as a bolus, the results were not confirmed. Perez-Barcena et al. [42] studied the effects of IV glutamine in a trauma population. These authors did not find a clinical advantage to this treatment, possibly related to the fact that the dose administered did increase plasma levels above normal values in 39 % of the treated group who started with very low plasma levels at baseline. This study reinforces the hypothesis that administration of specific nutrients should be guided by adequate levels to ensure clinical efficacy. Identical conclusions were reached by Nie et al. [43] regarding the administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) in critically ill patients suffering from ARDS. This meta-analysis of a mix of studies with continuous/bolus enteral administration of various doses of mainly EPA, but also DHA and/or GLA, did not show any advantage in terms of mortality or length of ventilation or ICU stay. However, improvement in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at days 4 and 7 were found, suggesting some pharmacological effects. Continuous enteral administration appeared to be superior to high-dose bolus administration.",

It would appear that reduced renal blood flow or renal ischemia is not a major component of a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in sepsis. Renal inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms appear to result in tubular cell injury, most likely mediated by damage or pathogen-associated molecular patterns [pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) and damage/danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs)] which are filtered at the glomerulum and recognized by renal tubular cells via several receptors, such as toll-like receptor 4. The resulting overexpression of NF-kB and subsequent release of tumor necrosis factors and other cytokines lead to reduced sodium reabsorption, activation of tublo-glomerular feedback and further tubular cell injury. Eventually all these factors contribute to a loss of GFR and septic AKI [51]. Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of a large international multicenter database including 4,493 patients with septic shock found the development of AKI, which occurred in roughly 73 % of these patients, did not depend on the causal pathogen [52]. Although pulmonary infections were by far the leading cause of septic shock, a multivariate analysis fully adjusted for age, comorbidities and severity of disease showed that major risk factor appears to be the site infection, with urinary tract infection carrying the highest risk of AKI (OR 2.35, 95 % CI 1.78\u20133.09) followed by gastrointestinal and blood stream infections (each with an average OR of 1.5).",

            "text": "Prevention of AKI in both sepsis and non-sepsis-associated critical illness primarily depends on avoiding additional harm to the kidney [48, 53]. A previously underestimated risk factor may be the type of fluid used during volume resuscitation. Recent large randomized trials on fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis [54, 55] as well as in other critically ill patients [56] revealed that hydroxethylstarch (HES) carries a significant risk for AKI as well as the requirement for RRT. There even appears to be a sign of increased mortality [57, 58], which initially led the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to recommend suspension of the licensing for HES in all indications. This recommendation was subsequently partly withdrawn, to allow the use of starches in severe hemorrhage in trauma and during surgery at the discretion of the treating physician. This decision is questioned in depth by six experts of the EMA in a commentary published in \u201cWhat\u2019s New in Intensive Care?\u201d [59], who stress that continuing the use of HES means exposing a large number of patients to significant risk with potentially detrimental consequences. This commentary is supported by a systematic review investigating tissue deposition of HES [60]. Extracting data from 37 human (total 635 patients) and 11 animal studies, the authors demonstrated a significant accumulation of HES in several tissues, most predominantly in kidneys but also in relevant amounts in liver, bone marrow and skin. Additional sites of HES deposition were lymph nodes, spleen, lung pancreas, intestine, muscle, trophoblast and placental stroma. Interestingly, reports of (sometimes long-lasting) pruritus mainly originate from studies where HES has been applied for hemodilution as treatment of acute hearing loss. HES uptake by the kidney could be observed as early as 30 min after infusion. Storage in organs was cumulative and increased with increases in the amount of HES administered; in some cases HES accumulation was long-lasting, persisting more than 8 and 10 years in skin and kidney, respectively. Remarkably, in 15 % of patients HES storage and associated symptoms occurred already at low doses of 0.4 g/kg body weight. An accompanying editorial, however, addressed the issue of benefit versus harm in an extremely valid manner. Colloids, at least theoretically, should enable faster and more effective intravascular volume expansion than colloids, with less risk of volume overload as long as the glycocalix is not significantly damaged. Thus, in early volume resuscitation and hemodynamic instability which is not sufficiently treatable with crystalloids, colloids may be the only alternative to stabilize patients [61].",

            "text": "The issue of crystalloid administration also requires intense scrutiny in the light of recent experimental findings. The most frequently used crystalloid fluid is a 0.9 % sodium chloride solution (or \u201cnormal\u201d saline). This solution is far from being physiological, and its high chloride content of 154 mmol/l has been found to induce metabolic acidosis and vasoconstriction in the kidney, reducing the GFR in healthy volunteers [62]. A recent observational, before\u2013after study showed that switching from normal saline to more balanced solutions with chloride contents of <110 mmol/l resulted in less AKI and fewer requirements for RRT [63]. This aspect was further investigated by a retrospective analysis of nearly 110,000 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) treated with crystalloids [64]. The authors of this study looked at mortality associated with chloride administration (quantified as millimolar chloride per liter of volume administration) and found that patients receiving >500 mmol chloride had a significantly increased mortality compared those receiving 100\u2013200 mmol chloride (>10 vs. 3.5 %, respectively). However, the effect was also dependent on the total volume administered, and no negative effects of chloride could be shown for patients receiving <1,500 ml of fluids over a 72-h period. A multivariate analysis adjusted for fluid volume and severity of disease characterized by the Acute Physiology Score showed an increased risk of mortality (OR 1.094, 95 % CI 1.062\u20131.127) with increasing volume adjusted for a chloride load of >105 mmol/l. An accompanying editorial [65], however, highlighted that although these studies provide a signal of possible harm by normal saline, treating physicians have to consider that the effect appears to be dose dependent and that a randomized controlled trial proving this assumption, although still absent, is ongoing and the results expected soon. Until these results are available, physicians continuing the use of normal saline may be reassured by 150 years of clinical experience in its use and the fact that more 7,000 ICU patients have received 0.9 % saline in randomized controlled trials.",

Available data indicate that between 10 and 65 % of critically patients requiring RRT who survive to discharge may remain on chronic dialysis [67], although the largest randomized trials on RRT show renal recovery rates at 60 days of between 7 and 25 % [68]. However, even those patients who experienced AKI and never required RRT and showed recovery may develop chronic kidney disease later on and potentially end up on dialysis years after discharge from hospital. This population currently remains largely undetected [69]. A major problem may be the use of estimated GFR (eGFR), which is mainly based on serum creatinine levels. eGFR appears to overestimate renal function in patients staying in the ICU for a longer time. Such overestimation was nicely demonstrated in a secondary analysis of the EPANIC trial, involving 757 patients, which showed that a reduction in creatinine production was positively correlated with the length of stay in the ICU, likely due to muscle loss [70]. In this population, the discrepancy between measured creatinine clearance and eGFR became apparent in patients staying in the ICU for >7 days, was more pronounced after AKI, but was also apparent in the group who did not experience AKI. These results clearly indicate that without performing a proper creatinine clearance test, >50 % of patients with reduced renal function will be missed and probably not followed up for renal function.",

Using the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) database, they analyzed 1,511 patients admitted to the ICU at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who received heparin during their ICU stay. These authors reported that race, ICU type, gender, heparin dose, age and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were associated with such inappropriate aPTT.
