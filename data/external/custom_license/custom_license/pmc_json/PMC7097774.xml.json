            "text": "Resistance to apoptosis, often resulting from the overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, is common in cancers, but it remains uncertain whether defects in apoptosis are essential for tumour maintenance. Letai et al. investigated this idea using mice that develop leukaemia in which the overexpression of the key anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) could be conditionally turned off. Eliminating BCL2 rapidly induces apoptosis and leukaemia remission, providing support for the potential of BCL2 as an anticancer drug target, and suggesting that if apoptotic defects are eliminated, inherent death signals would kill cancer cells.",

Hsu and colleagues report the solution structure of the complex of nisin and lipid II, which indicates possibilities for the structure-based design of novel antibiotics.",
