Each year, >2.5 million persons from >180 countries, including 240,000 pilgrims from Europe, participate in Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The gathering of mass numbers of persons during the Hajj increases the risk for the spread of respiratory infections among participants, and this risk has raised global concern that travelers returning from this pilgrimage could contribute to the international spread of MERS-CoV. During the 2012 and 2013 Hajj and Umrah (a minor pilgrimage) pilgrimages, no MERS cases in pilgrims were reported (1,2). However, in 2014, cases of MERS-CoV infection were confirmed in 2 returning pilgrims in the Netherlands (3). The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee advised all countries to improve awareness about MERS-CoV among pilgrims and to conduct surveillance for MERS-CoV among pilgrims during and after Hajj (4).",

All samples were tested for MERS-CoV by using reverse transcription PCR targeting regions upstream of the envelope gene (6). Respiratory and serum samples from all 7 patients were negative for MERS-CoV. The respiratory samples were also tested for influenza A and B viruses and for rhinoviruses, as previously described (7\u20139). Of the 7 patients, 3 were positive for influenza B virus, 2 for influenza A(H3N2) virus, and 2 for rhinoviruses (Table). Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the influenza A(H3N2) strains belonged to the A/Hong Kong/146/2013-like viruses and the influenza B strains belonged to the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses of the Yamagata lineage, both of which are subtype H3N2 and B strains included in the 2014\u201315 seasonal influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere.",

Six of the patients had not received seasonal influenza vaccine before traveling; for the seventh patient, influenza vaccine uptake data were not available. In 2014 in Austria, the incidence of influenza-like illnesses was below the epidemic threshold during weeks 40\u201343: no cases of influenza were reported by the National Influenza Surveillance network, Austria (http://www.influenza.at). Therefore, it is likely that these 7 patients became infected while at the Hajj, as reported for patients during previous Hajj seasons (10), or while traveling through international airports.",
