However, the most important infectious diseases of modern food-producing human populations also include diseases that could have emerged only within the past 11,000 years, following the rise of agriculture1,2. We infer this because, as discussed below, these diseases can only be sustained in large dense human populations that did not exist anywhere in the world before agriculture. What were the sources of our major infectious diseases, including these \u2018new\u2019 ones? Why do so many animal pathogens, including virulent viruses like Ebola and Marburg, periodically infect human hosts but then fail to establish themselves in human populations?",

Our concluding section lays out some unresolved questions and suggests two expanded research priorities. We restrict our discussion to unicellular microbial pathogens. We exclude macroparasites (in the sense of ref. 7), as well as normally benign commensals that cause serious illness only in weakened hosts. The extensive Supplementary Information provides details and references on our 25 diseases, robustness tests of our conclusions, factors affecting transitions between disease stages, and modern practices altering the risk of emergence of new diseases.",

Our aim was to select well-defined diseases causing the highest mortality and/or morbidity and hence of the highest historical and evolutionary significance (see Supplementary Note S1 for details of our selection criteria). Of the 25 diseases, we selected 17 because they are the ones assessed by ref. 8 as imposing the heaviest world burdens today (they have the highest disability-adjusted life years (DALY) scores). Of the 17 diseases, 8 are temperate (hepatitis B, influenza A, measles, pertussis, rotavirus A, syphilis, tetanus and tuberculosis), and 9 are tropical (acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Chagas\u2019 disease, cholera, dengue haemorrhagic fever, East and West African sleeping sicknesses, falciparum and vivax malarias, and visceral leishmaniasis). We selected eight others (temperate diphtheria, mumps, plague, rubella, smallpox, typhoid and typhus, plus tropical yellow fever) because they imposed heavy burdens in the past, although modern medicine and public health have either eradicated them (smallpox) or reduced their burden. Except for AIDS, dengue fever, and cholera, which have spread and attained global impact in modern times, most of these 25 diseases have been important for more than two centuries.",

It turned out that, with one minor exception, the three sets yielded qualitatively the same conclusions for all 10 analyses, although differing in their levels of statistical significance (see Supplementary Note S4).

The paucity of Stage 2 and Stage 3 diseases (a total of only 5 such diseases) on our list of 25 major human diseases is noteworthy, because some Stage 2 and Stage 3 pathogens (such as anthrax and Ebola) are notoriously virulent, and because theoretical reasons are often advanced (but also denied) as to why Stage 5 microbes with long histories of adaptation to humans should tend to evolve low morbidity and mortality and not cause major diseases.

This difference is an immediate consequence of the differences enumerated in the preceding five paragraphs. If a disease is acute, efficiently transmitted, and quickly leaves its victim either dead or else recovering and immune to re-infection, the epidemic soon exhausts the local pool of susceptible potential victims. If in addition the disease is confined to humans and lacks significant animal and environmental reservoirs, depletion of the local pool of potential victims in a small, sparse human population results in local termination of the epidemic. If, however, the human population is large and dense, the disease can persist by spreading to infect people in adjacent areas, and then returning to the original area in a later year, when births and growth have regenerated a new crop of previously unexposed non-immune potential victims. Empirical epidemiological studies of disease persistence or disappearance in isolated human populations of various sizes have yielded estimates of the population required to sustain a crowd disease: at least several hundred thousand people in the cases of measles, rubella and pertussis2,7. But human populations of that size did not exist anywhere in the world until the steep rise in human numbers that began around 11,000 years ago with the development of agriculture1,9. Hence the crowd epidemic diseases of the temperate zones must have evolved since then.",

Thus, the rise of agriculture starting 11,000 years ago played multiple roles in the evolution of animal pathogens into human pathogens1,4,10. Those roles included both generation of the large human populations necessary for the evolution and persistence of human crowd diseases, and generation of large populations of domestic animals, with which farmers came into much closer and more frequent contact than hunter/gatherers had with wild animals. Moreover, as illustrated by influenza A, these domestic animal herds served as efficient conduits for pathogen transfers from wild animals to humans, and in the process may have evolved specialized crowd diseases of their own.",

Why do temperate and tropical human diseases differ so markedly in their animal origins? Many (4/10) tropical diseases (AIDS, dengue fever, vivax malaria, yellow fever) but only 1/15 temperate diseases (hepatitis B) have wild non-human primate origins (P = 0.04). This is because although non-human primates are the animals most closely related to humans and hence pose the weakest species barriers to pathogen transfer, the vast majority of primate species is tropical rather than temperate. Conversely, few tropical but many temperate diseases arose from domestic animals, and this is because domestic animals live mainly in the temperate zones, and their concentration there was formerly even more lop-sided (see Supplementary Note S8).",

An expression of this barrier is that primates constitute only 0.5% of all vertebrate species but have contributed about 20% of our major human diseases. Expressed in another way, the number of major human diseases contributed, divided by the number of animal species in the taxonomic group contributing those diseases, is approximately 0.2 for apes, 0.017 for non-human primates other than apes, 0.003 for mammals other than primates, 0.00006 for vertebrates other than mammals, and either 0 or else 0.000003 (if cholera really came from aquatic invertebrates) for animals other than vertebrates (see Supplementary Note S9).",

Those invisible agents of New World conquest were Old World microbes to which Europeans had both some acquired immunity based on individual exposure and some genetic resistance based on population exposure over time, but to which previously unexposed Native American populations had no immunity or resistance1,4,5,6. In contrast, no comparably devastating diseases awaited Europeans in the New World, which proved to be a relatively healthy environment for Europeans until yellow fever and malaria of Old World origins arrived11.",

The sole livestock species domesticated in the New World was the llama, but it is not known to have infected us with any pathogens1,2\u2014perhaps because its traditional geographic range was confined to the Andes, it was not milked or ridden or hitched to ploughs, and it was not cuddled or kept indoors (as are some calves, lambs and piglets). Among the reasons why far more tropical diseases (nine versus one) arose in the Old World than the New World are that the genetic distance between humans and New World monkeys is almost double that between humans and Old World monkeys, and is many times that between humans and Old World apes; and that much more evolutionary time was available for transfers from animals to humans in the Old World (about 5 million years) than in the New World (about 14,000 years).",

Almost all the studies that we have reviewed were based on specimens collected opportunistically from domestic animals and a few easily sampled wild animal species, rather than on systematic surveys for particular classes of agents over the spectrum of domestic and wild animals. A case in point is our ignorance even about smallpox virus, the virus that has had perhaps the greatest impact on human history in the past 4,000 years. Despite some knowledge of poxviruses infecting our domestic mammals, we know little about poxvirus diversity among African rodents, from which those poxviruses of domestic mammals are thought to have evolved. We do not even know whether \u2018camelpox\u2019, the closest known relative of smallpox virus, is truly confined to camels as its name implies or is instead a rodent virus with a broad host range. There could be still-unknown poxviruses more similar to smallpox virus in yet unstudied animal reservoirs, and those unknown poxviruses could be important not only as disease threats but also as reagents for drug and vaccine development.",

While falciparum malaria, an infection imposing one of the heaviest global burdens today, seems to have originated from a bird parasite whose descendants include both the Plasmodium falciparum infecting humans and the P. reichenowii infecting chimpanzees, malaria researchers still debate whether the bird parasite was introduced to both humans and chimpanzees12 a few thousand years ago in association with human agriculture, or instead more than five million years ago before the split of humans and chimpanzees from each other13. Although resolving this debate will not help us eradicate malaria, it is fascinating in its own right and could contribute to our broader understanding of disease emergence. In the case of rubella, a human crowd disease that must have emerged only in the past 11,000 years and for which some close relative may thus still exist among animals, no even remotely related virus is known; one or more may be lurking undiscovered somewhere. Does the recent identification of porcine rubulavirus and the Mapuera virus in bats as the closest known relatives of mumps virus mean that pigs infected humans, or that human mumps infected pigs, or that bats independently infected both humans and pigs? Is human tuberculosis descended from a ruminant mycobacterium that recently infected humans from domestic animals (a formerly prevalent view), or from an ancient human mycobacterium that has come to infect domestic and wild ruminants (a currently popular view)?",

Although more is already known about the origins of some of these agents (AIDS, influenza A and measles) than about others (rotavirus, smallpox and tuberculosis), more comprehensive screening is still likely to yield significant new information about even the most studied agents, as illustrated by the recent demonstration that gorillas rather than chimpanzees were probably the donor species for the O-group of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-114. The proposed effort would involve systematic sampling and phylogeographic analysis of related pathogens in diverse animal species: not just pigs and other species chosen for their ready availability, but a wider range of wild and domestic species whose direct contact (for example, as bushmeat) or indirect contact (for example, vector-mediated) with humans could plausibly have led to human infections. In addition to the historical and evolutionary significance of knowledge gained through such an origins initiative, it could yield other benefits such as: identifying the closest relatives of human pathogens; a better understanding of how diseases have emerged; new laboratory models for studying public health threats; and perhaps clues that could aid in predictions of future disease threats.",

One of us (N.D.W.) has been working in Cameroon to monitor microbes in people who hunt wild game, in other people in their community, and in their animal prey15. The study is now expanding to other continents and to monitor domestic animals (such as dogs) that live in close proximity to humans but are exposed to wild animals through hunting and scavenging. Monitoring of people, animals, and animal die-offs16 will serve as an early warning system for disease emergence, while also providing a unique archive of pathogens infecting humans and the animals to which we are exposed. Specimens from such highly exposed human populations could be screened specifically for agents known to be present in the animals they hunt (for example, retroviruses among hunters of non-human primates), as well as generically using broad screening tools such as viral microarrays17 and random amplification polymerase chain reaction (PCR)18. Such monitoring efforts also provide potentially invaluable repositories, which would be available for study after future outbreaks in order to reconstruct an outbreak\u2019s origin, and as a source of relevant reagents.",
