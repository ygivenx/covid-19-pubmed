His mother collected pre-Columbian pottery. These early life experiences he mythologized into a complex persona, often referring to himself as part savage. \u201cYou know that I have Indian blood, Inca blood in me, and it\u2019s reflected in everything I do\u2026. I try to confront rotten civilization with something more natural, based on savagery.\u201d",

He became entirely consumed by art when he worked for a time with Vincent van Gogh. \u201cI am a great artist and I know it.\u201d After the stock market crash in 1882, he left Paris to travel and seek the authentic life he believed would lead him to greatness. \u201cYou must remember,\u201d he wrote to his wife, \u201cthat I have a dual nature, [that of] the Indian and [that of] the sensitive man.\u201d",

Free at last with no money troubles and able to love, sing, and die.\u201d He painted his best work during his first of two trips to Tahiti. He died of syphilis nearly penniless in the Marquesas.",

This preferred world he created in his art. From the exotic islands he extracted magical colors he then placed side by side in unconventional combinations and clearly outlined. Despite his admiration for and friendship with the impressionists, he shunned their work in favor of the flat planes that anticipated modern art.",

Although he had not yet entirely abandoned perspective, spatial relationships are secondary to color and form. Traces of impressionist technique appear in the brushwork of the foliage and thatched roof of the hut. But the human and animal figures, including the namesake pigs, are simplified, almost archaic in their peacefulness, and entirely at ease with the surroundings.",

It is still extending, but retains its original character of solitude and isolation, which is only accentuated by the immense expanse of the ocean.\u201d Yet even this isolation that Gauguin sensed so acutely was an illusion. During a period of exotic introductions, local animals were modified along with the political, economic, spiritual, social, and physical landscape.",

As animals and the viruses, bacteria, and internal and external parasites that travel with them find themselves evolving independently from their forbearers in new ecologic niches with new pressures and pathogenic tools, genetic changes occur in them. These changes facilitate emergence of new pathogens that can then start the process over again as the pathogens continue to span the globe.",

This oneness in nature, with its inherent intimacy of all the macroscopic and microscopic players, requires concurrent attention to human health, animal health, and environmental health. For in this cauldron, as full participants and hosts of the wild microbes, which inhabit and kill us, we remain, like Gauguin, part savages.",
