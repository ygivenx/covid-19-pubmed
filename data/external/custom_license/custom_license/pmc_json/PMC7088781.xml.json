            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the Arteriviridae family, causes an economically devastating of swine production, late-term abortion and stillbirths in sows, and respiratory distress in nursery pigs [1]. The virus was firstly isolated in Netherlands in 1991 and in US in 1992. Today, PRRS has been considered endemic in many swine-producing countries. There are three major structural proteins in PRRSV, glycoprotein 5 (GP5), matrix protein (M), and nuclocapside protein (N), which are encoded by ORF 5, 6, and 7, respectively. The predominant arteriviral envelope proteins are major glycoprotein GP5 and the unglycosylated M, the other membrane proteins occur only in minor quantities in the viral envelope. The 25\u201327 kDa GP5 protein is the most abundant envelope glycoprotein and a major inducer for neutralizing antibodies. The 18\u201319 kDa M protein is a membrane protein without N-terminal signal sequence. As demonstrated experimentally by the closely related M protein of coronavirus [2, 3], the arteriviral M protein is likely to play a key role in virus assembly and budding. GP5 and M proteins exist as heterodimeric complexes in the viral surface. The disulfide-linked complexes are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells preceding or during virus assembly [4\u20137]. GP5/M heterodimers is likely to constitute the basic protein matrix of the virion envelope. The relatively smaller ectodomains of the heterodimers probably constitute the tiny surface projections that can be observed on arterivirus particles under the electron microscopy [8, 9]. These surface structures were presumed to play an important role in the process of the virion attachment to the receptor and entering the host cells. In short, GP5 is the major virus antigen associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies and protection [10\u201312]. M has been considered associating with the development of strong cellular immunity [13].",

MVA has a substantial history as a vaccine agent for the prevention of smallpox, and more recently as a viral vector in both cancer and infectious disease settings [18\u201321]. There are several characteristics making MVA more outstanding than other viral vaccine vectors. (A) MVA had been attenuated for use as a safe smallpox vaccine by serial passage in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). During these passages, the virus underwent numerous deletions and mutations that result in an incapable replication in most mammalian cells, but it still can replicate to high titers in CEF and BHK-21 cells [22\u201324]. Consequently, MVA was safe when it be administered to human and was avirulent even for immunosuppressed animals [25\u201327]. In fact, the safety of MVA has been demonstrated in the most susceptible populations [24, 26]. (B) Due to the defective replication in human cells for MVA only affect virus assembly, while its viral and inserted foreign gene replication, transcription and expression remained unimpaired [28]. (C) MVA has the ability to induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses in both animal models and humans [29], better than or at least as good as that achieved by standard replicating strains of vaccinia virus [30\u201332]. (D) The immunogenicity of MVA might be enhanced by the spontaneous deletion of many immune evasion genes during the extensive passage history on CEF [22, 33]. (E) MVA has large capacity for inserting foreign DNA. (F) The construction making with MVA is much easier than other viral vaccine vectors.",

However, there is no report about the differences on eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses against PRRSV infection between these two expression patterns\u2014co-expressing GP5 and M proteins and expressing GP5 and M as fusion protein. Also, nobody has tried to express GP5 and M proteins in the powerful viral vector\u2014MVA. In this article, four recombinant viruses that expressed GP5 and M proteins of PRRSV in MVA with different expression patterns were constructed. rMVA-GP5/M, expressing GP5 and M proteins under the control of two promoters, rMVA-GP5-M expressing GP5 and M as fusion proteins under one promoter, rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M, the recombinant virus expressing GP5 or M separately. With these recombinant MVA viruses, the influence of expression pattern for GP5 and M proteins in MVA on their immunogenicity was investigated in this study. Results showed that rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M cannot induce obvious humoral and cellular immune responses; rMVA-GP5-M inoculated group developed better immune responses than rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M inoculated groups; however, mice inoculated with rMVA-GP5/M maintained the strongest cellular response against PRRS and consistently enhanced the anti-PRRSV humoral responses. These data indicate the potential usefulness of MVA-based vaccine vector designs co-expressing GP5 and M proteins against PRRS.",

The animals were sacrificed and the splenocytes were prepared as described in materials and methods. Splenocytes were stimulated by UV inactivated PRRSV. As shown in Fig. 7, the profiles of the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 were similar to that of NT assays. The rMVA-GP5/M inoculated group had the highest level of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, which even reached to 72.6 and 76.1 pg/ml, respectively, at 60 dpi. The IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production of rMVA-GP5-M inoculation mouse group was significantly lower than rMVA-GP5/M inoculation group but higher than that of rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M inoculation group (p < 0.05). No increase of IL-4 production was detected in all rMVAs inoculated mice compared with the wtMVA and PBS inoculated groups. These results suggested that the expression of GP5 and M proteins of PRRSV in MVA could elicit Th1 type cellular immune response. To the efficacy of cellular immunity of PRRSV, co-expressing GP5 and M under the control of two promoters is the best. The magnitude of the cellular immunity elicited by four rMVAs of GP5 and M proteins of PRRSV consistent with those got from neutralization assays, which the ranking is rMVA-GP5/M, rMVA-GP5-M, rMVA-GP5, and rMVA in the order of high to low. As expected, no significant production increase of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4 were detected in wtMVA compared with PBS injection group. Experiments were triplicated.\n\n",

To date, PRRS has spread worldwide with the characteristics of endemic in those swine-cultivating countries, causing enormous economic losses each year. The research of developing efficient PRRS vaccine has been on the forefront of clinical research in recent years. Although modified live vaccines (MLV) and inactivated vaccines are now commercially available and widely used [37], no ideal vaccines were achieved so far. There has been not a single report suggesting that live vaccine virus might possibly revert to virulence and cause acute PRRS-like symptoms during its persistence in swine herds after vaccination [38]. The killed vaccine cannot always provide solid protective immunity at herd level [39, 40]. There is an urgent requirement to develop vaccines more effective and to alter the strategies against this viral disease. Recombinant virus design is one of the common and useful methods.",

The data obtained in this article demonstrated that the rMVA co-expressing PRRSV GP5 and M proteins could elicits higher titer of PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies and Th1 type cell-mediated immune responses in mouse model. In comparison of the immunity effect of the four recombinant viruses, rMVA-GP5/M, co-expressing GP5 and M proteins under two promoters, was the best; rMVA-GP5-M, expressing GP5 and M protein as fusion protein, was the second; rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M, expressing GP5 or M separately in the two recombinant viruses, were the last. Therefore, the rMVA-GP5/M has the potential to be a novel candidate for PRRSV vaccination.

Furthermore, to prevent the infectious diseases, farmers have to inoculate various vaccines continuously. These are not only making the vaccination situation of swine complex, but also are part of the reasons that the vaccination of PRRS failed. In present study, we choose MVA as the viral vector for the expression of GP5 and M proteins of PRRSV, besides the reasons mentioned in the introductions, the most important is that the MVA was safe and avirulent even for immunosuppressed animals [25\u201327, 48].

The Psyn and P7.5 promoters, which can efficiently drive high-level expression of recombinant protein both in vitro and in vivo, have been extensively used for foreign gene expression in vaccinia virus system. Psyn is a synthesized early/late strong vaccinia virus promoter and P7.5 is a late/early vaccinia virus promoter. GP5, the most abundant and important viral antigenic protein, has been a leading target for PRRS vaccine design. M protein was considered associating with the development of strong cellular immunity. It has been postulated that the formation of heterodimers of GP5 and M proteins may play a critical role in assembly of virus particle [49] and recognizing of the host cell receptor [50]. Co-expression of GP5 and M proteins under the control of two promoters in MVA may partly mimic the formation of GP5/M heterodimers in PRRSV and the process of antigen recognitions that displayed and treated in vivo, and making the rMVA-GP5/M had much better effect than rMVA-GP5-M expressing GP5 and M proteins as fusion protein on induction of immune responses. The lower neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses elicited in mice immunized with rMVA-GP5-M was supposed that fusion expression of GP5 and M proteins might alter the natural conformational structure of these two proteins and led to only partial of the neutralizing epitopes of GP5 and M proteins could be presented to the antigen-presenting cells.",

IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 are powerful inducers of the differentiation of naive T-helper cells to Th1-type cells that generally produce specific sets of cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-h [51, 52]. IL-4, on the other hand, potently induces the Th2 phenotype, which produces IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 [51, 53]. IL-4 is critical for Th2 differentiation. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, generally considered as Th1 cytokine, also play an important role in Th2 induction [54]. In addition, IL-2 is responsible for the proliferation of both T and B cells and increasing cytolytic activity of NK cells [55\u201357]. In this study, the differences of cellular immune responses which induced by inoculation of rMVAs expressing GP5 and/or M proteins was evaluated by measuring the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-4 in splenocytes of inoculated mice (Fig. 7). A significant higher production of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 were detected from the mice inoculated with the rMVAs but almost no difference for the detection of IL-4. It can be postulated that the vaccination of rMVAs elicited the PRRSV specific cellular immunity, and this cellular immunity was activated by the proliferation of Th1-type cells [58\u201360]. The magnitude of the cellular immunity elicited by four rMVAs was consistent with that got from neutralization assays, in which the ranking is rMVA-GP5/M, rMVA-GP5-M, rMVA-GP5, and rMVA-M according to the order, high to low.",
