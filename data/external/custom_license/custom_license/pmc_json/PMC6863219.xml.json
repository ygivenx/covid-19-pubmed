Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), known as coronavirus of chickens, causes important economic losses to the poultry industry. Studies about the presence of CoVs in wild birds, especially IBV, in South America are scarce [2]. Coronaviruses (CoVs) possess the largest genomes among RNA viruses and have relatively high mutation rates and recombination frequencies when compared with other single-strand RNA viruses, which may allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches [3\u20135]. These characteristics are exemplified by the two emerged highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses, CoV-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and the CoV-MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) [6].",

This virus affects the gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems and may lead to mortality rates as high as 30% and sudden drops in egg production [7]. Moreover, many novel CoVs genetically distinct from IBV have been recently identified in different families of wild and domestic birds and mammals but their potential economic losses remain unknown. Recently, Dur\u00e3es-Carvalho et al. (2015), described the detection of delta- and betacoronaviruses in captive wild birds, from a rehabilitation center, originally captured in S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul state with close evolutionary relationships with CoVs isolated from mammals [8].",

Samples were collected from wild birds after capture with mist nets, strategically placed between 30 and 250 cm of the ground, and by hand nets on an open field in public parks. The field works were made according to the permission of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and National Center for Research and Conservation of Wild Birds (CEMAVE) developed and followed protocols approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo.

Of the 746 bird samples collected from 2006 to 2013 in different regions of Brazil and analyzed by conventional RT-PCR, six samples (0.8% of total) from two different regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Table 2). Our study describes the detection of samples related to avian gamma- and deltacoronaviruses in birds collected in southeast and southern region of Brazil, more specifically in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul state (Table 3). The presence of CoV RNA was detected in three Chinese geese (Anser cygnoides) sampled in Ibirapuera Park, downtown S\u00e3o Paulo, southeast Brazil. One sample has shown similarities (93%) with sequences from viruses in the gammacoronavirus group, which are related to migratory birds only, whereas the other two samples (84%) belong to the deltacoronavirus group. Even though these sequences are closely related to those of wild bird CoVs, this group also includes ferret, pig, and leopard CoVs, demonstrating the potential for spillover events between coronaviruses from bird and mammal hosts. In the same way, in southern Brazil, three samples positive for CoVs were obtained from migratory birds captured in wintering areas at Lagoa do Peixe National Park, state of Rio Grande do Sul. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these samples (PNLP 100, PNLP 115, and PNLP 159) belonged to two CoV genera. Samples related to gammacoronaviruses were obtained from one Calidris alba and one Calidris fuscicollis individual, respectively, related a restricted to sandpiper species (Fig. 2). Samples related to deltacoronavirus were obtained from a black skimmer (Rynchops niger) carrying a strain that clustered, in phylogenetic analysis, closer to the clade of viruses found in Ibirapuera Park (Fig. 3).",

Wild birds make up a large portion of the species of animals that inhabit the park (ca. 142 species). The birds are kept free and cohabiting with the human population and other wild species (resident or visitors). There are another 21 species of wild animals, including bats and skunks, and the park also allows pets [23]. Such close contact between so many different species may cause interspecific transmission and recombination events, leading to the appearance of emerging viruses [24]. The three goose samples were collected from geese that live in this same environment in contact with wild birds that use the park as a stopping point. On the other hand, three migratory birds captured in wintering areas at Lagoa do Peixe National Park-RS have shown positive results of CoVs too. Sandpipers are boreal migrants that migrate south from North America in the winter [25]. A CoV related to deltacoronavirus group was obtained from a black skimmer (Rynchops niger), thus highlighting the possibility that migratory birds may be carrying these viruses across migratory routes in Brazil [9]. The Lagoa do Peixe region is an important migratory route [25], and it is located close (400 miles) from one of the most important region of poultry farm production of Brazil, more specifically region of Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul State [26]. The proximity between the migratory routes of wild birds infected by gammacoronavirus shows the importance of a continuous surveillance and potential contact control between poultry and migratory birds as measures to avoid any chance of viral transmission between these animals.",

On the other hand, Jordan et al.

Coronavirus RNA were detected in birds species of Anatidae family (Chinese goose) in Ibirapuera Park, S\u00e3o Paulo, southeast Brazil. Anatidae birds were already described as hosts of coronavirus all over the globe. However, interestingly, we report for the first time the detection in two sandpiper species (Calidris alba and Calidris fuscicollis) from Lagoa do Peixe National Park, a wintering area in southern Brazil. Although our data indicate a low prevalence of coronavirus in birds sampled, the genetic similarity between coronavirus detected at birds from distinct continents may indicate that wild birds are possibly carrying coronavirus throughout migratory routes as observed for avian influenza virus. We report the detection of samples related to delta- and gammacoronaviruses in different species of birds, some sampled in a park located inside the largest city in South America, indicating the circulation of coronavirus in urban areas (Table 3). In addition, all birds tested in this study were in apparently healthy populations. Further studies are required to determine the species and full genome similarity with other avian CoVs. However, our findings indicate that CoVs may be circulating among one of the major avian migratory routes in the world.",
