After primary infection, some infected individuals experience sporadic viral reactivations. HSV-2 has been shown to increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sexual acquisition approximately 3-fold in both men and women, and primary HSV-2 infection may have an even greater effect on HIV-1 susceptibility1. Currently, there is no cure or vaccine for HSV infection. Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, penciclovir and valacyclovir, are proven to be an effective approach to shortening the length of herpes reactivation and reducing recurring outbreaks. Because these drugs specifically target HSV thymidine kinase (TK), drug-resistant mutants can arise in immunocompromised individuals2,3.",

The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family and are primarily responsible for the stress signal and proinflammatory cytokine stimulations. Activated JNK/p38 MAP kinase can transmit upstream signals to downstream factors, thus mediating cellular apoptosis, differentiation, growth or immune responses4,5. JNK and p38 MAP kinase are also reported to be stimulated by many viruses or virus-associated proteins, including rotavirus6, varicella-zoster virus (VZV)7,8, HIV-19, HSV-110,11, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)12, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)13, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus14 and hepatitis B/C virus (HBV/HCV)15,16. The activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase cascade induced by these viruses either facilitates the viral lytic cycle or serves as a defense mechanism of the host cells. Therefore, virus-induced activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway is considered to be universally important for viral infection or cell survival6,7,10,12,16.",

McLean et al. reported that JNK/p38 activation by virus entry and immediate-early (IE) gene expression was correlated with c-Jun and ATF-2 trans-activation and that the activation of JNK was necessary for efficient HSV-1 replication10. Karaca et al indicated that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation would reduce HSV-1 viral propagation11. It was proposed that cellular JNK and p38 MAP kinase may serve as potential targets for preventing HSV-1 and HSV-2 viral infection.",

Further research demonstrated that BX-795 was also a potent and relatively specific inhibitor of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase \u025b (IKK\u025b), which inhibited the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activity of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3)19. In the current study, we report that BX-795 exhibited inhibitory activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection and demonstrated that the antiviral activity of BX-795 was independent of its anti-PDK1 and anti-TBK1/IKK\u025b activities, and was instead mediated through disrupting the activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the anti-viral activity of BX-795, and this study may facilitate the identification of new anti-HSV targets and the development of therapeutic agents.",

As shown in Figure 2, when cells were pretreated with BX-795, ICP0 and ICP27 mRNA transcription of HSV-1 (Figure 2D) and HSV-2 (Figure 2E) increased in a dose-dependent manner at an early stage of viral infection (6 h postinfection) (the effect of BX-795 is complex at 6 h pi, particularly the enhancing effect for ICP0 at 6 h pi). In contrast, at 12 h postinfection, BX-795 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the expression of not only these two IE genes but also on the late gene (gD) in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these observations, we speculate that BX-795 did not reduce HSV IE gene expression directly at the early period of the viral life cycle and that its apparent inhibitory activity on ICP0, ICP27 and gD mRNA level 12 or 24 h postinfection might be due to the decreasing level of infectious progeny virions in the presence of BX-795.",

To investigate its antiviral mechanisms, we analyzed whether BX-795 acts by inhibiting PDK1 activity. We first investigated whether HSV infection would trigger intracellular PI3K/Akt pathway by Western blot analysis of phosphorylated-PI3K and phosphorylated-Akt (Thr308). Thus, HSV-2 induced phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt 6 h postinfection, suggesting that viral replication and infection stimulate PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation (Figure 3A), and BX-795 inhibited HSV-2-induced phosphorylation of Akt 12 h postinfection, as shown in Figure 3B. However, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation does not seem to be required for HSV-2 replication due to the fact that LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, failed to exhibit any effect on HSV replication. As shown in Figure 3C, gD expression was minimally affected by even high concentrations (at 10 \u03bcg/mL and 100 ng/mL of LY294002 and rapamycin, respectively) of the inhibitors used, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway does not regulate HSV replication but rather the outcome of HSV infection. Therefore, BX-795 does not seem to inhibit HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication through its anti-PDK1 activity.",

Evidence has shown that JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways were also stimulated by HSV-1 infection and their activations play a central role in HSV replication10,11,17. As shown in Figure 4A, HSV-2 infection increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 but reduced ERK phosphorylation 8 h postinfection in human genital epithelial cells HEC-1A cells, suggesting that it only activated JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. Similar results were observed with HSV-1 (data not shown). We also investigated whether HSV-2 infection would influence the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2, which are downstream targets of JNK and p38 MAP kinase32,33,34. c-Jun was activated between 6\u201312 h postinfection, and ATF-2 was only activated and phosphorylated 12 h postinfection, as shown in Figure 4B.",

The results in Figure 4C indicated that only SB203580 and SP600125, but not PD98059, inhibited viral replication in both HEC-1-A and Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that JNK and p38 pathways were the rate-limiting steps in HSV viral protein synthesis and replication, consistent with previous reports10,11,17. We found that BX-795 interfered with the phosphorylation and activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase induced by HSV-2 infection of HEC-1-A cells 12 h postinfection (Figure 4D). Furthermore, BX-795 blocked HSV-2-induced activation of c-Jun and ATF-2 (Figure 4E), c-Jun phosphorylation and the activation stimulated by PMA (Figure 4F), suggesting that the BX-795 blockage of virus-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation was not specific for the virus-associated protein, but rather, targeted certain cellular kinases associated with the viral infection. We also confirmed that BX-795 inhibited c-Jun nuclear translocation (Figure 4G) induced by both HSV-2 infection and PMA, consistent with the results shown in Figure 4D\u20134F.",

Whether BX-795 inhibited AP-1 activation mediated by other stimuli was investigated. As shown in Figure 4I, PMA- and TNF-\u03b1-stimulated AP-1-binding site-driven luciferase expression was inhibited by BX-795. To further confirm that the effect of BX-795 on viral replication is JNK/p38 dependent, we investigated the effect of p38/JNK overexpression on HSV replication inhibited by BX-795. The results indicated that, when compared with the BX-795-pretreated cells, viral replication increased slightly when the cells overexpressed p38/JNK with BX-795 treatment (Figure 4J). The results indicated that inhibition of HSV replication by BX-795 can be at least partially rescued by overexpression of p38/JNK. In conclusion, BX-795 inhibition of HSV replication was mediated by the JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways.",

Expression of ICP0 has been reported to stimulate intracellular AP-1 and NF-\u03baB activation37,38. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of BX-795 on ICP0-induced AP-1 and NF-\u03baB activation. As shown in Figure 6A, BX-795 impeded HSV-1 and HSV-2 ICP0-induced AP-1 activation in HEC-1-A, Vero and 293T cells. However, BX-795 did not inhibit ICP0-mediated NF-\u03baB activation which was only blocked by MG132, confirming the observations by Diao et al38. Two other potent NF-\u03baB inhibitors, PDTC and BAY11-7082 (Figure 6B), did not block ICP0-mediated NF-\u03baB activation.",

Phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), the phosphorylated form of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4)-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is catalyzed by PI3K, can trigger membrane colocalization of PDK1 and Akt and lead to downstream mTOR activation41,42. Hsu et al reported that HSV-1 infection induced activation of the Akt pathway in oral epithelial cells which was mediated by HSV IE gene expression43. BX-795 is a PDK1-inhibitory pyrimidine with an IC50 of 111 nmol/L in the cell-free system22 and also active in inhibiting HSV-2-induced Akt phosphorylation and activation in a dose-dependent manner as shown in the current study (Figure 3B). However, the results with the specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and an inhibitor of downstream mTOR, rapamycin, suggested that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway did not affect viral late gene expression and replication because neither molecule inhibited the viral late gene expression (Figure 3C), although HSV-2 activated the PI3K/Akt pathway in human genital tract epithelial cells (Figure 3A). It was shown that the inhibition of PI3K attenuated HSV-1 ICP0 gene expression but did not affect thymidine kinase expression and viral replication. An alternative explanation could be that BX-795 can also act on a different target from those of LY294002 and rapamycin, such as PKC or downstream factors, leading to the activation of JNK/p38 mediated by MKK4, 7 and MAPK.",

            "text": "JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways are important for HSV gene expression and viral propagation10,11,17. McLean et al reported that activation of JNK was necessary for efficient HSV replication, and stable expression of JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP-1, an inhibitor of JNK translocation to the nucleus) led to a 70% reduction in HSV-1 propagation10. Karaca et al found that the presence of SB203580 in HSV-1-infected cell culture attenuated 85%\u201390% virus yield11. This finding was consistent with our results on HSV-2 replication in HEC-1-A cells shown in Figure 4C. The activation of JNK/p38 MAP kinase may stimulate viral gene transcription via downstream AP-1 activation. JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways can be induced not only by HSV-2 infection but also by stimuli, such as PMA and TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 4). We demonstrated that HSV-2 infection induced c-Jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation and AP-1 binding activity (Figure 4B and 4H). c-Jun and ATF-2 are two components of the transcription factor AP-1, which regulates gene expression in response to a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, growth factors, stress and microbes44. These two proteins are substrates of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. The transcriptional activity of c-Jun is regulated by phosphorylation through JNK45, and ATF-2 can be a target of the JNK or p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways32,33,34. The viral replication increased when cells were pretreated with BX-795 and overexpressed p38/JNK (Figure 4J), indicating that overexpression of p38/JNK partially rescued HSV replication inhibited by BX-795. We, therefore, postulate that BX-795 inhibited HSV infection by attenuating activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway and downstream AP-1 activation.",

Zachos et al demonstrated that the virion transactivator protein VP16 was both necessary and sufficient for the activation of JNK/p38 pathways even in the absence of any other viral context17. However, Hargett et al employed HSV IE gene mutant viruses to investigate viral proteins necessary for JNK/p38 MAP kinase activation and showed that ICP27 alone was sufficient46. Although some controversies exist, it is apparent that viral immediate-early events are responsible for JNK/p38 MAP kinase activation. Evidence has suggested that activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway was necessary for HSV early and late gene transcription. As shown in Figure 2, BX-795 exhibited no inhibitory effect on viral ICP0 and ICP27 transcription at 6 h postinfection but a significant inhibitory effect at 12 h postinfection. Therefore, we postulate that BX-795 exerted its anti-viral activity between IE and late gene transcription.",

However, using a protein kinase assay in a cell-free system, Clark et al reported that BX-795 did not influence MKK3/6 or MKK4/7 activation. The discrepancy between Clark's results and our results may be attributed to the different experimental systems used (cell-free in Clark's and cell-based assay in ours) or, although less likely, by the higher BX-795 concentrations used in our experiment. Another potential explanation is that the direct target of BX-795 in the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway may be upstream of JNK/p38 and MKK4. Reports have shown that BX-795 inhibited MLK1 (MAP3K9), MLK2 (MAP3K10) and MLK3 (MAP3K11), which could act as an upstream activator of MKK4 and JNK/p38 MAP kinase19. We postulate that BX-795 inhibited the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway by interfering with upstream MLK1-3. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation.",

IRF-3 is a member of the interferon regulatory transcription factor family49 and is pivotal for IFN production and the innate immune response to viral infection49. IFN is known to have an inhibitory effect on HSV IE and early protein expression50. Ma et al51 reported that HSV infection inhibited TBK1 activity, which facilitated viral productive infection, indicating that TBK1 is a negative regulator of HSV propagation. BX-795 inhibited IKK\u025b and TBK1 with IC50 at 41 and 6 nmol/L in a cell-free system, respectively. It was not clear whether its anti-TBK1/IKK\u025b activity contributed to anti-HSV efficiency. Therefore, the effect of BX-795's anti-TBK1/IKK\u025b activity on HSV infection, if any, would facilitate viral replication.",
