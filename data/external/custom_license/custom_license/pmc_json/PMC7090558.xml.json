            "text": "Many buildings, especially office buildings, create an artificial climate by using heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. These systems manage and deliver fresh air with a well-controlled temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) and a reduction in the concentration of particles from the outside air (Sepp\u00e4nen and Fisk 2004). Good maintenance of air handling units (AHUs) leads to health benefits and better productivity. Some individualized biological elements like spores, bacterial cells, and viruses are present in the indoor air and included in the term \u201cbioaerosol\u201d (Douwes et al. 2003). Particles can be classified on a scale of 0.005\u2013100 \u00b5m. Closed environments are 5\u201310 times more polluted than outside (Jones 1999). A few studies have provided the number of hours that people spend in closed environments like offices, homes, shops, and gyms. In 2014, Export Enterprises SA published the number of hours spent indoors per day in different countries in the world. They estimated an average of 8.12 h per day, equivalent to 34% of the day (Export Enterprises SA 2014). According to neuroscience research, people sleep for 29\u201333% of their day (Aritake et al. 2004; Siegel 2003) while another sociological study revealed that people spend 14% of their day at home (Turcotte 2005).",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are one of today\u2019s most important public health topics due to their high contagiousness. Most of them are easily transmitted by direct contact, droplets, or aerosolization. These infections can evolve from an ordinary viral infection to an outbreak (Tellier 2006). All particles smaller than 30 \u00b5m in size can invade a room very rapidly (Morawska 2006). It is estimated that 7 mg of particles less than 2 \u00b5m in size can be emitted by coughing (Zhu et al. 2006). The study of Fabian et al. (2011) demonstrated that a person infected with influenza can exhale 3\u201320 influenza viruses per min with just normal breathing. Another study of Coxsackie virus explained that 160 viral particles are emitted during sneezing and coughing (Couch et al. 1966; Downie et al. 1965). On average, 480 L of air are breathed by an adult in 1 h (Hermann and Cier 1973). The studies of Couch et al. (1966) and Downie et al. (1965) observed that infected people can generate 0.1\u201310 viruses L\u22121 h\u22121 and proved that two infected people simply breathing (without coughing or sneezing) and occupying an office of 40 m3 for 4 h can contaminate indoor air with 0.24 virus L\u22121 m\u22123 (with no renewal of air).",

            "text": "Filters in ventilation systems could be a source of microbial air pollution in the closed environment (Bluyssen et al. 2003). Some studies have shown that ventilation systems and AHUs spread and transport viral particles inside buildings (Ezratty and Squinazi 2008; Fabian et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2006). In a meta-analysis, 22 studies out of 40 proved the direct contribution of ventilation and airflow to spreading indoor infectious airborne viruses in office buildings during the SARS outbreak and other viral outbreaks (Li et al. 2007). Some recent studies have detected airborne bacteria and some specific viruses on HVAC filters in a daycare center (Prussin et al. 2016) and large public buildings (Goyal et al. 2011). Myatt et al. (2004) analyzed 181 filters of AHUs used for 47 h and showed that 58 filters were contaminated with 59% picornavirus, 24% corona virus, and 17% parainfluenza virus. The temperature and the relative humidity (% RH) in the AHU can have an effect on the persistence of viral particles; as temperature and humidity decreases, the persistence of influenza viruses increases. For example, with a temperature of 20\u201325 \u00b0C and 20% RH, the persistence of the influenza virus is higher than at 50% RH. The persistence decreases when humidity increases to 80% (Harper 1961; Lowen et al. 2007; Schaffer et al. 1976). The mengovirus exhibits rapid inactivation at RH between 40 and 60% (Songer 1967).",

At the end of the cylinder, four circular outputs of diameter 4 cm, which accommodate the filters, are arranged perpendicular to the flow. Three of the four outputs are equipped with the filter to be studied. Downstream of the filters, the BioSampler (SKC Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) samples the particles passing through the filters. The sampling rate is 13 L min\u22121 at the entry of each BioSampler (SKC Inc., Pennsylvania, USA). Two volumetric pumps are set downstream of the device to ensure the flow of air treated through the filters.

The experimental set-up used in this study represents a model of the real-life functioning of an air handling unit. The pilot was validated using fluorescein and then confirmed with mengovirus showing an efficiency between 78.8 and 81%. The loss observed in the pilot validation is due to viruses that are retained on the walls of the pipes and the column (difficult to extract), the efficiency of the BioSampler collector (78%) and of the filter extraction (74%). The filter used in this study (F7-CompAir) is commonly used in AHUs and shows the same filtration speeds (0.16 m s\u22121) and an effectiveness of between 83.8 and 98.5%. This calculated effectiveness was confirmed in the study of Bailly (2001) on the efficiency of the air filter resulting from curves of the four filtration phenomena. The dynamics and characteristics of bioaerosols are an important topic. The size of mengovirus was determined by the study of Faulkner et al. (1961) as 27 nm. In this study, some hypotheses can be made: The nebulized mengovirus cannot be aerosolized as a single virus as no virus was detected on the ELPI\u2122 stage with the specific size of the virus. The aerosol could be constituted of groups of viruses (more than 3 viruses). The virus could be associated with proteins or debris cells present in the centrifuged medium. This can be confirmed in real life as infectious respiratory viruses are expelled with cell debris and mucus.",

            "text": "Goyal et al. (2011) did not detect any infectious virus in used ventilation filters from two large public buildings but they were able to detect viruses by PCR. Farnsworth et al. (2006) showed the difficulty of detecting the persistence of viruses in AHUs since most viruses present on AHU filters are deactivated within a day. The study of Vasickova et al. (2010) focused on the inactivation rate of viruses on different supports. The review of Gerba (2013) revealed different inactivations between viruses. They pointed out differences in inactivation between enveloped and non-enveloped respiratory viruses. For example, they found that the inactivation rate was 0.25 log10. h\u22121 for rhinovirus and 0.625 log10 h\u22121 for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). They concluded that non-enveloped respiratory viruses can survive longer than enveloped viruses. This shows the importance of using mengovirus in this study, which is a model of non-enveloped rhinoviruses. The WHO review about the potential transmission of Avian Influenza (H5N1) through Water and Sewage (2017b) reports that, in general, virus half-lives are of the order of hours. The literature states that the virus support, for example, here the filter samples, can play a role in reducing infectivity. The WHO report on the stability and resistance of the SARS coronavirus (2017a) indicates that the persistence of this virus on wood and cotton cloth is only 12 h. Other studies like Sizun et al. (2000) have proved that human coronavirus can persist for only 3\u20136 h on sterile sponges while the study of Hall et al. (1980) pointed out that RSV can persist for 2.5 h on cloth gowns and 1 h on paper towels.",
