Furthermore, antibodies against S1, S2, N protein could detect their corresponding proteins from the lysates of SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Immunnoprecipitation showed that S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 fragments in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells, thus demonstrating the cleavage of S protein in host cells, which may play a crucial role in pathogenesis of SARS infection.",

The bacterial cells were grown in LB medium at 37\u00b0C with ampicillin (1.0 mM). For the expression of SARS-S1, S2, S proteins, bacterial cells were induced by IPTG (final concentration 0.1 mM-0.2 mM) for 3 h in 22\u00b0C and then cells were recovered and disrupted by French Pressure cell press. Since most of S, S1 and S2 proteins were found in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysates, we purified S, S1, S2 proteins by Model 422 Electro-Eluter (Bio-Rad) according to Manufacturer's manual. For the expression of SARS-E protein, bacterial cells were induced with 0.5 mM of IPTG. After induction at 25\u00b0C for 5 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM edetic acid, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DDT) , 1 mM PMSF) and sonicated on ice bath for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a glutathione Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DDT) and the column was washed with the same buffer. After the GST-fused SARS-E protein bound column was equilibrated with Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the eluate was collected. For SARS-3CL, N protein expression, bacterial cells was induced by IPTG (10 mM) at 22\u00b0C for 16h in tryptone-phosphate medium, proteins were extracted with buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM imidazole, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. The supernatant of the extract from 1 L of culture was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (8 ml) followed by washing with \u223c100 ml of 20 mM imidazole in buffer A (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).

In the first group the spike glycoprotein is translated as large polypeptide which is cleaved into S1 and S2 fragments, and in the second the S protein is left untouched. The cleavage site within the first group remains relatively conservative. Studies in Bovine coronavirus, Avian infectious bronchitis virus, human coronavirus and mouse hepatitis viruses (MHVs) suggested that there is a conserved sequence between the S1 and S2 subunits and the motif of the sequence is RRSR 17, 20. However, we could not find such a motif in SARS-CoV. Based on bioinformatis analysis are deduced that the cleavage site was located in the amino acid residues between R667 and S668 (RS667\u2013668). Here we subcloned the sequence of SARS-CoV spike gene as two subunits (S1 and S2) which were expressed respectively. The results demonstrated that both antibodies against S1 and S2 could bind to intact S protein, indicating that both antibodies will be useful for detecting S protein. Since the cleavage of S protein may be critical for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infectivity, the generated anti-S1 and S2 antibodies would allow us to study the interaction between S1 and S2 proteins and their functions.",

It showed that both S2 and S proteins could be detected in the lysate, indicating that the cleavage of S protein may be involved in the SARS-CoV maturation. This finding will be helpful to explore the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infectivity as well as to develop new drug for disease treatment. For example, assuming the cleavage was very important for the SRAS-CoV infection, the inhibition of this processes may consequently stop the virus infection. Our finding is consistent with the results from Dr. Marcus Eickmann's group, which also demonstrated that the S protein of SRAS-CoV was cleaved into S1 and S2 fragments in Vero E6 cells (personal communication).",

By using these antibodies, we demonstrated that the S protein underwent cleavage in Vero E6 host cells. We will further confirm the above findings in vivo or in other cell lines and investigate how this cleavage is involved in the SARS-CoV pathogenesis.",
