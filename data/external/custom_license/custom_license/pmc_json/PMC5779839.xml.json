A known virus was identified in 44% of samples, with varying detection rates by age and site. For isolates with undetectable virus, we cannot distinguish between inadequate sampling from the participant, issues relating to transport of the sample, or presence of an unknown virus. Picornaviruses were the most common viruses observed followed by influenza. While influenza was only confirmed in approximately 2% of the placebo\u2010group participants, the 2008 influenza season in Australia was particularly mild, following on from the notably severe 2007 seasonal epidemic.\n30\n Given this, however, we do acknowledge that under\u2010ascertainment may have occurred as a result of subclinical infections and potential failure of participants to report mild symptoms, despite intensive follow\u2010up.",

We speculate that this may be due to infection with a strain of influenza not covered by the vaccine. In a further study of household transmission (in preparation) using the Questionnaire data set, we find further evidence consistent with this hypothesis, although without further virus typing, cannot subject our hypothesis to further scrutiny.",

The study population varies from the general population, being younger, less likely to smoke and more likely to be women. Furthermore, the study population who returned a questionnaire, enabling an examination of symptom score, was further biased towards women and those 35 years and over. Two\u2010thirds of participants were immunised against influenza, associated with the anticipated reduction in influenza cases in the vaccinated proportion. Swabs were only collected from individuals presenting for ILI evaluation, and not from a \u2018control\u2019 population.
