In such cases, variola virus particles were detected in joint fluid (9), and vaccinia virus was isolated from a bone biopsy specimen of an affected limb (10,11). It is unclear whether the manifestation of arthritis in bats is a normal or rare result of the infection, or a new development in the evolution of the virus. Likewise, the frequency of poxvirus infection in big brown bats is impossible to estimate at this stage. Because the public is generally cautioned against handling downed bats because of possible rabies infection, underestimation of prevalence is likely. Infectious disease surveys of bats might have missed the infection up to this point because no obvious lesions are apparent on the skin, and swollen joints might have been classified as being arthritis without suspicion of infectious disease involvement.",

No evidence of poxviruses was found in the animals investigated in those studies. The zoonotic potential or host range of the virus described herein is not known, but at a minimum, the virus could pose a newly emergent threat to bat populations. Likewise, it is not clear if the infection seen in bats is a result of spillover or possibly an introduction of the virus into a new area. The isolate does not group with any of the 8 characterized genera of Chordopoxvirus; its nearest neighbor is Cotia virus, an as yet unclassified chordopoxvirus first isolated from sentinel suckling mice in a state reserve in Cotia County, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, in 1961 (15).",
