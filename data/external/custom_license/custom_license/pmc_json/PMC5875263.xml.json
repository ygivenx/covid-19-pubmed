This classification was left as a single category in the absence of reliable methodology to subdivide it. Mild immunosuppression was defined as a condition in which immunosuppression was documented but susceptibility to infection was estimated to be less than twice that of an immunocompetent host.

Because of the lack of studies quantifying this reduction, we assumed x to be 0.5, as in a previous study (39).

Flat smallpox age-specific rates were lowest for the 10\u201314-year age group (30 cases/1,000 persons infected) and reached 180 cases/1,000 persons infected for the oldest age group.

We assumed 100% of severely immunocompromised persons would develop hemorrhagic disease. We assumed the vaccinated subgroup had reduced susceptibility and rates of severe smallpox types. We estimated that 25.3% of vaccinated persons would get vaccine-modified smallpox (9). We applied a waning immunity function over time at a rate of 1.41% per year from vaccination (36) and assumed the rates of hemorrhagic and flat smallpox would increase with time from vaccination while rates of vaccine-modified smallpox would decrease with time from vaccination (Technical Appendix Table 4).",

The model used ordinary differential equations to move populations into epidemiologic states related to their smallpox infectious status: susceptible, infected, prodromal, infectious, recovered, or dead. Once infected, populations were moved into the next state on the basis of disease duration rates. To obtain the age-specific force of infection (i.e., the rate at which susceptible persons acquire smallpox), we used the Euler approximation to make discrete contact rates, assuming the rates were proportional to the patterns observed in the United Kingdom. Then, to account for the different infectivity rates of different smallpox types, we estimated the transmission parameter \u03b2 (i.e., the probability of getting infected from a contact) for each smallpox disease type to calculate the R0 for hemorrhagic, flat, ordinary, and vaccine-modified smallpox. Finally, we multiplied the force of infection by a parameter (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b14; Technical Appendix Table 2) to account for the different susceptibility levels of different populations.",

Ensuring that persons with immunosuppression (including healthcare workers) avoid contact with persons with smallpox (if possible) should be a priority. Smallpox would always be more pathogenic than vaccinia virus, so any patient with a bona fide exposure to smallpox should be vaccinated with a fully potent vaccinia strain, such as ACAM2000 (44). If such patient develops a serious complication, such as eczema vaccinatum or progressive vaccinia, the patient can be treated with ST-246 (Siga Technologies, New York, NY, USA) (45).",

We also used conservative estimates for the increased risk for infection in immunosuppressed persons and grouped persons with severe and moderate immunosuppression into single categories because of the absence of more specific data to categorize them further by degree of immunosuppression. The contact matrix we used was estimated in a study conducted in the United Kingdom in 2006, which might not necessarily reflect New York or Sydney social contact patterns (37). Furthermore, contacts with symptomatic infectious patients will probably drop to near zero once an outbreak has been confirmed and patients are well isolated, assuming adequate health system capacity for isolation and treatment of smallpox patients. The data in the model on age-specific rates of smallpox were obtained from hospitalized patients (9), which might overestimate the rates of severe disease in the model outputs.",

Ensuring adequate hospital care and isolation facilities will also help in epidemic control. During the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, lack of beds resulted in widespread community transmission, and modeling showed that 70% of patients needed to be in treatment facilities to control the epidemic (46). The response to severe acute respiratory syndrome, with its rapid control despite the lack of a vaccine or antiviral agent, showed that patient isolation can be very successful (47). Experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and Middle East respiratory syncytial coronavirus also illustrate the heavy toll on healthcare workers (48), who should be assumed to be at high risk for infection in the event of a smallpox outbreak.",
