In addition to culling, Hong Kong introduced better market conditions, sanitation and vaccination. More recently, Thailand has been successful with the time-honoured agricultural practice of surveillance, restriction of poultry movement, and culling, with farmer compensation.",

Although this seems like sound advice, others may argue for international provision of mobile BSL3 laboratories, trained staff, and assistance to build up local infrastructure. The FAO has been working diligently in this respect, but the funding is running out. This is one of many reasons why there are so few H5N1 virus samples from humans and other animals",

Although no H5N1 flu viruses have been isolated from domestic poultry or humans in Hong Kong since 2004, the virus has been circulating in herons and falcons. It is also notable that the H5N1 virus has continued to evolve: in late 2002 it acquired the ability to kill its natural host, wild waterfowl, and spread across ten countries in southeast Asia2. The virus has also expanded its host range to include tigers and domestic cats3. The concern is now whether it will acquire consistent human-to-human transmission.",

The steps taken include: modifying live-poultry marketing practices by banning ducks, geese and quail (the original sources of flu); introducing two \u2018clean days\u2019 per month, when all markets are simultaneously emptied and cleaned; vaccinating all locally raised and imported poultry with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine; and introducing unvaccinated \u2018sentinel\u2019 poultry into each chicken house. These goals have been achieved by model interagency cooperation between the Hong Kong departments of health, agriculture, and food and safety, together with the University of Hong Kong.

The few comparative tests that have been done on agricultural vaccines from different suppliers show that some are good and some are bad. Bad vaccines prevent the symptoms of disease but not virus excretion, which can lead to later infection. One of the many arguments against the use of agricultural vaccines is that they promote the selection of mutations in the circulating virus, perpetuating the risk of infection either in the original species or in others. This effect has been documented recently for the H5N2 vaccines used in Central America4. However, mutations and selection will occur whether vaccines are used or not. In Hong Kong, sentinel birds provide a way to monitor virus excretion and the generation of mutations.",

Thailand has pursued a massive surveillance of poultry in its \u2018X-ray programme\u2019; trained personnel visited all villages in late 2004 to collect virological and serological samples. The culling of ducks in Thailand (with farmer compensation) has reduced the flocks of ducks that were positive for H5N1 from almost 40% infected in October 2004 to almost undetectable levels in March 2005. Thus, reducing H5N1 infection in poultry clearly reduces the threat to humans.",

Unless high-quality vaccines are developed and used, H5N1 viruses that are benign in ducks but lethal for chickens and humans will be selected (although this is likely to occur naturally anyway). Our aim must be to reduce the virus load in ducks below the transmissible level, as was achieved by vaccinating chickens in Hong Kong.
