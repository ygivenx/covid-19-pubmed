The olfactory mucosa generates new olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through normal turnover, and also after injury, in order to maintain its function (Graziadei and Graziadei 1979; Schwob 2002). The ORNs are produced by proliferation of globose basal cells with newly generated neuronal cells migrating toward the surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium during maturation. The ORNs express specific molecular markers depending on their maturational status. Immature ORNs express growth-associated protein (GAP)-43 or neuron-specific \u03b2III tubulin (\u03b2IIIT) (Verhaagen et al. 1990; Lee and Pixley 1994; Roskams et al. 1998), whereas mature ORNs express olfactory marker protein (OMP) (Monti Graziadei 1983; Kream and Margolis 1984).",

PVOD is considered to be caused by damage to the nervous tissues of the olfactory pathways, which may not have fully recovered from the initial functional damage. It can also cause unpleasant olfactory symptoms such as parosmia and phantosmia (Doty 1979).",

Most of the studies regarding PVOD have focused on virus-induced apoptosis of the olfactory neuroepithelium or the olfactory bulb (Schwob et al. 2001; Welge-Lussen and Wolfensberger 2006), while there have been few studies focusing on the damage caused by immune responses.",

Various viruses produce double-stranded (ds) RNAs during their replication cycle (Jacobs and Langland 1996), which are recognized by TLR3. The stimulation of TLR3 causes the translocation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB into the nucleus and the subsequent release of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 (Alexopoulou et al. 2001; Matsukura et al. 2006). These cytokines induce migration and activation of inflammatory cells. In general, immune system processes work to protect the host against pathogens, but excessive immune response might itself cause tissue damage. Primed neutrophils release various inflammatory mediators, such as neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G, into extracellular spaces, and NE in particular is thought to be mainly involved in tissue damage (Janoff 1985; Inoue et al. 2006).",

To elucidate the contribution of neutrophils to tissue damage, we also performed three experiments to determine: (1) how the olfactory neuroepithelium could be injured by the intranasal administration of elastase itself, (2) whether Poly(I:C)-induced neuroepithelial damage could be suppressed by a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, and (3) whether Poly(I:C)-induced neuroepithelial damage could be suppressed in a neutropenic murine model treated with cyclophosphamide, which induces myelosuppression.",

We selected the 9th post-treatment day because the number of mature olfactory receptor neurons was the lowest at this time point. This behavioral test relies on the mouse\u2019s natural tendency to investigate novel smells. Briefly, mice were acclimated to a clean plastic cage (46 cm \u00d7 23.5 cm \u00d7 20 cm) without wood chip bedding for 30 min, and then presented with a filter paper soaked in mineral oil placed in a 35 mm polystyrene dish for 3 min. This procedure was repeated three times at 1 min intervals. On the fourth trial, a filter paper soaked instead with propyl propionate was presented for 3 min. The mouse behavior was recorded with a digital video camera and each investigation time was measured. Investigation was defined as the mouse\u2019s nose being within 1 mm of the filter paper. The investigation time on the fourth trial was compared to that on the third trial. Mice with normal olfaction show significantly reduced sniff times when an odor is reintroduced for the second and third time (habituation), but they show a reinstatement of sniffing when a novel odor is presented. A lack of this reinstatement indicates the decrease or absence of olfactory sensitivity.",

We selected these regions for analyses because they were observed to be the most severely injured in the sections examined (see \u201cResults\u201d). The number of neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes was counted along the entire length of the left olfactory mucosa and in the left nasal cavity. To compare the amount of mucus in the Bowman\u2019s glands, we selected three random high-magnification microscopic fields (\u00d7400) along the II, IV, and V ethmoturbinates and measured the cross-section area of Alcian blue-positive mucus in the Bowman\u2019s glands using image analysis software (ImageJ, NIH) (n = 3/group).

First, we examined the morphological appearance of the olfactory mucosa in the mice treated with cycrophosphamide (CPA). Although CPA may be able to inhibit the proliferation of basal cells in the olfactory mucosa and cause morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium, the dose used in this study did not cause any effects on either the olfactory mucosa or epithelium during the observation period (data not shown). We then tested whether the number of infiltrated neutrophils was reduced in neutropenic mice. In the Saline-Poly(I:C) group, a number of neutrophils were observed in the olfactory mucosa and the nasal cavity 3 days after intranasal administration of Poly(I:C) (Fig. 15a). In contrast, in the CPA-Poly(I:C) group, neutrophils were rarely observed (Fig. 15b), although the number of macrophages which had infiltrated the olfactory mucosa appeared to be similar to that in the Poly(I:C) group (data not shown). Degeneration of the olfactory neuroepithelium 9 days after administration of Poly(I:C) in the CPA-Poly(I:C) group (Fig. 15d) was less severe than that in the Saline-Poly(I:C) group (Fig. 15c). The number of OMP-positive ORNs was significantly greater in the CPA-Poly(I:C) group than in the Saline-Poly(I:C) group (p < 0.0001; Fig. 15e). Furthermore, the number of Ki67-positive cells was significantly smaller in the CPA-Poly(I:C) group than in the Saline-Poly(I:C) group (Fig. 15f, p < 0.0001)",

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the expression of TLR3 in the olfactory mucosa. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-TLR3 antibody showed intense labeling in the apical part of supporting cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium. Supporting cells occupy a major part of the surface of the olfactory mucosa and are frequently exposed to foreign substances. Although the function of supporting cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium has not been fully elucidated, previous studies have proposed several possible roles, including mucus production or regulation, scavenging of local odorants, and phagocytosis of apoptotic ORNs (Suzuki et al. 1996; Makino et al. 2009). The results of the current study strongly suggest that the supporting cells also serve as a first line of defense for the immune system by taking foreign materials into the cytoplasm and inducing an immune response.",

The most likely explanation for this finding would be that intranasal administration of Poly(I:C) induced rapid mucus secretion from Bowman\u2019s glands into the nasal cavity and a decrease in the total amount of mucus in Bowman\u2019s glands. Another possibility, not mutually exclusive with the first possibility, is that the toxic effect of Poly(I:C) reduced the production of the mucus in the acinar cells of the glands, and/or the mucus composition in the glands was altered and the Alcian blue-positivity became reduced. Whatever the cellular mechanisms, this histochemical change in Bowman\u2019s glands suggests that they are affected by Poly(I:C) stimulation and possibly contribute to the elimination of pathogens by secreting mucus.",

Several types of inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes then infiltrated the olfactory mucosa in a time-dependent manner. Neutrophils were the dominant cell type in the early phase of the response. Macrophages and T lymphocytes infiltrated to a lesser extent and remained in the olfactory mucosa relatively longer than neutrophils. It has been reported that, when airway epithelial cells are stimulated by Poly(I:C), they produce leukocyte chemoattractants such as IL-8 and MIP-1\u03b1 (Matsukura et al. 2006; Berube et al. 2009; Ohkuni et al. 2011), leading to the infiltration of inflammatory cells. IL-8 upregulation following the activation of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells is mediated by the NF-\u03baB and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways (Berube et al. 2009). In the current study, we observed similar upregulation of TLR3-mediated signaling molecules and MIP-2 in the olfactory mucosa. Therefore, we speculate that the neutrophil influx into the olfactory mucosa was caused by the upregulation of MIP-2 expression, which was induced via the TLR3 signaling pathway activated by Poly(I:C).",

Neutrophil elastase also induces the production of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1(MIP-1), and mucin, from epithelial cells (Sommerhoff et al. 1990; Nakamura et al. 1992; Bedard et al. 1993), resulting in the exacerbation of inflammation. In the present study, the tissue damage was most severe in the lateral area of the olfactory region, where neutrophilic infiltration was marked, suggesting that neutrophils might be involved in the pathogenesis of tissue damage. We also demonstrated that Poly(I:C)-induced olfactory neuroepithelial damage was inhibited by prior administration of the neutrophil elastase inhibitor, Sivelestat. In addition, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of elastase induced neuroepithelial damage, and that Poly(I:C)-induced neuroepithelial damage was suppressed in the neutropenic murine model. These findings strongly suggest that neutrophil elastase plays an important role in the Poly(I:C)-induced damage of the olfactory neuroepithelium. It has previously been reported that a neutrophil elastase inhibitor reduced the number of neutrophils in a murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia (Yanagihara et al. 2007). In the current study, there was no significant difference in the number of infiltrating neutrophils between the Sivelestat-Poly(I:C) group and Saline-Poly(I:C) group. This result suggests that, although neutrophil elastase is involved in the pathogenesis of the Poly(I:C)-induced neuroepithelial damage, other inflammatory mediators provoke the recruitment of neutrophils in the olfactory mucosa.",

Although we focused on TLR3-mediated cellular and molecular events in the olfactory mucosa, real viral infections can induce other innate immune responses and adaptive immune responses which could also contribute to tissue damage. For example, it has been shown that viral infections can activate a broader set of intracellular innate immune receptors, such as TLR7 or TLR9. By using an experimental model in which a specific molecular pathway is activated, we would be able to demonstrate that TLR3 signaling is one of the components of an immunological reaction during viral infections in the olfactory mucosa. Other signaling pathways could be evaluated using the same methodology.",

These findings suggest that the cell death of ORNs induced by intranasal administration of Poly(I:C) occurred partly due to a caspase-3 mediated apoptotic process, but mostly due to other mechanisms such as necrosis. They also suggest that other cell types in the neuroepithelium, such as supporting cells and basal cells also underwent cell death through apoptotic processes. The pathophysiology of cell death in the olfactory mucosa has been investigated in a number of experimental studies, which have suggested that the mode of cell death varies depending on the etiology. For example, a study using transgenic mice which express TNF-\u03b1 in supporting cells under the control of doxycycline demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 can cause the loss of mature ORNs and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the olfactory mucosa (Lane et al. 2010). In this model, supporting cells were retained despite extensive loss of mature ORNs, suggesting that apoptosis is the primary mode of ORN cell death. In another model, when mice were sensitized to intranasal Aspergillus fumigatus extract and subsequently challenged acutely or chronically with the allergen, the mice demonstrated elevated eosinophil infiltration and olfactory sensory neuron apoptosis. However, massive neuronal apoptosis without eosinophil infiltration also occurred in nonsensitized mice after a single dose of the extract (Epstein et al. 2008). This suggests that the fungal allergens could induce ORN apoptosis in both an eosinophilic inflammation-dependent way, and also in a direct toxicity way mediated through TLR2 or 4, the latter of which may be similar to what we observed in our Poly(I:C) models. In a nasosinusitis model infected with Staphylococcus, single-strand DNA-, Bcl-2-, or Bax-positive apoptotic cells were detected in olfactory neuroepithelium, and, interestingly, the apoptosis of ORNs in the non-infected (i.e., contralateral) side was also upregulated (Ge et al. 2002). The distribution of apoptotic cells was different between infected side and non-infected side, suggesting that the mechanism underlying ORN apoptosis is different.

However, neutrophils generally accumulate in response to tissue damage and release cytotoxic chemical mediators, so neutrophil infiltration may, at least partly, be involved in the exacerbation of tissue damage as a common mechanism of olfactory mucosal injury. It would be interesting to test if the inhibition of neutrophil function used in our study could also reduce tissue damage in other experimental models of olfactory mucosal injury.",

Since the pathogenesis of PVOD may also involve cell death due to the direct action of viral infections on olfactory cells (Schwob et al. 2001; Mori et al. 2002), further study is needed to elucidate the detailed pathogenesis of PVOD, and it is important to select an experimental model appropriate to the purpose of the study.",

We would expect considerable variability in the number of ORNs among individuals due to extrinsic and intrinsic factors (Kondo et al. 2009; Holbrook et al. 2011).

At 24 days, the olfactory neuroepithelium appeared to have regenerated almost completely (d\u2033\u2032). Ki67-positive cells and \u03b2IIIT-positive cells had increased at 9 days (f\u2033, h\u2033) and returned to near control levels at 24 days (f\u2033\u2032, h\u2033\u2032). Bar 50 \u03bcm",
