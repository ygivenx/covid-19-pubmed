The syndrome is defined as abnormal pulmonary physiology with multi-lobar opacities on chest imaging that are not attributable to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) or other organ failures [1]. Many pathologies meet IPS criteria, including organizing pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage, among others. Biologic heterogeneity within this broadly defined syndrome may diminish the ability to detect the effect of treatments.

The biomarkers elevated in BALF from subjects with DAH mediate the recruitment and activation of innate and adaptive immune effector cells [6\u201310].

            "text": "Given the number of comparisons made in our broad examination of biomarkers, some of our statistically significant findings may be false positives. Both preclinical and clinical studies have contributed importantly to the current understanding of IPS. Reassuringly, our results are similar to those found in experimental models and clinical settings. Panoskaltsis-Mortari et al. examined lung protein extracts, serum, and BALF from a murine IPS model exposed to cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, allogeneic HCT, and natural killer (NK)-cell depleted spleen cell infusion (a T-cell source) [11]. This study demonstrated time-varying elevations in MIP-1\u03b1 and MCP-1 messenger RNA expression and protein production in all compartments relative to healthy controls. In another preclinical study, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and MCP-1 were expressed early after irradiated mice received allogeneic bone marrow transplants [12]. Experimental disruption of either MCP-1 or its receptor lowered BALF monocyte, macrophage, and in the latter case, T-cell counts and lessened histopathologic lung injury. Clinical studies demonstrate that MCP-1 levels are elevated in BALF collected from people with IPS relative to healthy controls and individuals with chronic noninfectious lung disease after HCT [4, 12]. In one observational study, BALF sampled before and after TNF-\u03b1 antagonist therapy demonstrated decreases in MCP-1 and other inflammatory mediators in the subset of subjects who experienced clinical improvement [4]. Our study extends these findings by suggesting that IPS subtypes may have different inflammatory profiles and therefore differing response to immunomodulatory therapies.",

Eight of the 17 study subjects were HHV-6 positive. HHV-6 was similarly distributed between subjects with and without IPS and between subjects with IPS and DAH and subjects with non-DAH IPS. BALF and plasma cytokine levels did not differ between IPS cases with HHV-6 and IPS cases without HHV-6 (data not shown).

The lack of standard methods to correct for dilution of BALF may introduce error.

The onset of non-DAH IPS occurred later than IPS with DAH and more often after engraftment. In this study, DAH may be a surrogate for important biologic differences between early- and later-onset IPS. Alternatively, the differences we found may relate to time passing instead of varied biology.
