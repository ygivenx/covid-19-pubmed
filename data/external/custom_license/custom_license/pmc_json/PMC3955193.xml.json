Long pentraxin PTX3, a member of pentraxin super family, is also an acute phase protein and has been defined as a key prototypic component of the humoral arm of innate immunity (12). PTX3 is of particular interest due to its local expression from a variety of tissues at the site of infection and inflammation (12, 13, 27).

This may be due to the dose used, timing, or route of administration, and does not rule out an effect of PTX3, but it should be further studied. The genetic background of mice in the present study is 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J. We have shown that the severity of acute lung injury induced by airway infection of MHV-1 varies depending upon the strains of mice (4). The function of PTX3 in different strains of mice thus merits further investigation. This will be clinically relevant because the susceptibility of patients to SARS-CoV also varies. Different strains of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV have been developed by Subbarao\u2019s (6) and Barnard\u2019s groups (7), respectively. It would be interesting to further test the potential protective effects of PTX3 with these viruses, which may be more directly relevant to SARS.",

Furthermore, neutrophil infiltration was enhanced in the lungs of PTX3 deficient mice, which was attenuated by PTX3 treatment. We have shown that PTX3 deficiency also worsens the lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (36). These findings are consistent with a newly defined anti-inflammatory role of PTX3 in the recruitment of inflammatory cells, in which PTX3 binds to P-selectin and attenuates neutrophil migration to the sites of inflammation (37). Therefore, in addition to its effects on viral binding and facilitating viral clearance, it is reasonable to speculate that the regulatory function of PTX3 on inflammatory responses may confer further protective effects in coronavirus-induced lung injury. It has been shown that the severity of pulmonary lesions induced by MHV infection correlated better to the elevated inflammatory responses than to the viral replication in the lung (38). Therefore, inhibition of inflammatory responses is important in protecting the lung from injury.",

Alveolar macrophages are key effector cells of the innate immune response to pathogen invasion (39), but may also be able to modulate excessive inflammation and render an immune-suppressive effect in the lung (40). Unlike neutrophil influx, which decreased one week after MHV-1 infection and was inhibited by PTX3 treatment, macrophage infiltration remained elevated in the lung even at two weeks post MHV-1 infection. PTX3 administration further increased the influx of macrophages in the lungs of PTX3 KO mice. We speculate that macrophages may play an important role in anti-viral immunity, viral clearance and lung tissue repair, although the mechanisms for this effect remains undefined at this time. MCP-1 (CCL2) and MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4) are chemokines related to monocyte recruitment. Interestingly, both of these chemokines were down-regulated by exogenous PTX treatment in the lung of PTX3 KO mice. It is possible that in PTX3 KO mice, the regulation of macrophages in the lung is altered due to unknown compensatory mechanisms.",
