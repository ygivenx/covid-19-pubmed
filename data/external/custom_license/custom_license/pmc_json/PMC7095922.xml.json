            "text": "N. meningitidis, also referred to as meningococcus, is an obligate human Gram-negative bacterium that normally resides in the nasopharyngeal mucosa without affecting the host, a phenomenon known as carriage1. Pathology is initiated when meningococci gain access to the bloodstream, multiply in the blood and disseminate into various tissues, causing meningitis or purpura fulminans, the most severe form of meningococcal invasive disease. Despite antimicrobial therapy, systemic meningococcal infections remain a major cause of mortality and severe neurological sequelae2,3,4. The endothelium lining blood and lymphatic vessels is a key barrier separating circulating body fluids from host tissues and is a major target for several pathogenic bacteria5. A crucial step in the pathophysiology of invasive bloodborne meningococci is their adhesion to and proliferation in both peripheral and brain blood microvessels, a process referred to as vascular colonization6. This intimate interaction of meningococci with endothelial cells leads to deregulated inflammatory and coagulation processes, endothelial dysfunction and, ultimately, the breach of endothelial barriers and bacterial dissemination into perivascular tissues4. Deciphering the mechanisms that govern this initial pathophysiological step of invasive meningococcal diseases represents an essential development toward the design of new therapeutic approaches to control bacterial infection and subsequent vascular and tissue damage. The capacity of pathogenic capsulated meningococci to interact tightly with human endothelial cells relies on the expression of type IV pili3,5. However, the host cell adhesion receptor that mediates the bacterial attachment to human vessels has remained unknown.",

They mediate adhesion to endothelial cells and signaling events that eventually lead to bacterial translocation through endothelia7,8,9,10. These structures are heteromultimeric assemblies of pilin subunits that form helical fibers11. The major pilin subunit, PilE, constitutes the essential fiber scaffold and is subject to antigenic variation. Other less abundant ('minor') pilins, such as PilV, PilX and ComP, structurally resemble PilE and participate in various pilus-related functions such as adhesion, bacterial aggregation and DNA uptake, respectively12,13,14. Both PilE and PilV have been shown to be involved in adhesion to host cells9,15,16,17,18. Furthermore, these two pilins were recently reported to activate the G protein\u2013coupled \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR), which promotes the endothelial signaling events that are subsequent to bacterial adhesion9,19. However, \u03b22-AR\u2013depleted endothelial cells, although unable to promote signaling events, still support pilus-mediated bacterial adhesion, thus indicating that the primary meningococcal attachment requires another, yet unidentified, host receptor for type IV pili.",

Treatment of BB19 cells with phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent transcriptional regulator, induced enhanced adhesion of the meningococcus strain Nm2C4.3 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Treatment with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D blocked the TPA effect, suggesting the regulated expression of a putative receptor by TPA at the transcriptional level (Supplementary Fig. 1a). As expected for type IV pilus\u2013mediated adhesion, a nonpiliated meningococcal PilE\u2013null mutant (\u0394pilE) failed to adhere to TPA-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In order to identify upregulated genes in permissive cells, we used a differential, quantitative, large-scale analysis of gene expression (Online Methods) that showed 211 genes upregulated by TPA among 10,478 analyzed genes. Six of them encoded membrane-associated proteins (Supplementary Table 1). Among those, four proteins had either limited tissue distribution (sialic acid\u2013binding Ig-type lectin 4 (siglec 4), siglec 11 and delta- and Notch-like epidermal growth factor\u2013related receptor were located mainly in the brain) or limited surface exposure (phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein). Therefore, we instead focused on the type 1 plasma membrane protein CD147, a member of the Ig superfamily20 and a well-established marker of brain capillaries21,22, and CD59, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein known to inhibit membrane attack complex formation in the complement cascade and to induce signaling events23. We confirmed that TPA treatment of BB19 cells upregulated expression of CD147 and CD59 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). CD147 expression was enriched at sites of meningococcal adhesion, whereas CD59 was not (Supplementary Fig. 1d).",

In noninfected fully polarized hCMEC/D3 or HBMEC monolayers, CD147 was enriched at cell-cell junctions, where it is engaged in homophilic interactions26,27, and was also present at the luminal surface (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Upon infection with Nm2C4.3, CD147 accumulated at sites of meningococcal adhesion to hCMEC/D3 cells (Fig. 1a) and HBMECs (Supplementary Fig. 2a), as already observed for the signaling \u03b22-AR receptor9,19.

Both antibodies labeled noninfected hCMEC/D3 cells similarly (Supplementary Fig. 5b), but only MEM-M6/1 efficiently labeled CD147 molecules recruited to bacterial adhesion sites, suggesting that the MEM-M6/6 antibody and meningococci compete for the same binding site in the C-terminal Ig domain of CD147 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Accordingly, preincubation of hCMEC/D3 cells or HBMECs with the MEM-M6/6 antibody before infection inhibited the initial attachment of Nm2C4.3 under shear stress by 55% and 75%, respectively, whereas the MEM-M6/1 antibody reduced the initial attachment by only 25% and 20% (Fig. 2h).

These results indicate that, despite relatively low affinities of PilESB and PilV monomers for CD147, their clustering on staphylococci can provide sufficient avidity to CD147, which is consistent with the multimeric organization of pilins within pilus fibers. We then quantified the interaction of PilE variants or PilV with CD147 by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3g). We observed a load-dependent correlation for the interaction forces of PilE variants or PilV with CD147, further confirming the specificity of this interaction (data not shown). Measured interaction forces with CD147 (62 \u00b1 15 pN, 58 \u00b1 16 pN and 49 \u00b1 12 pN, for PilESA, PilESB and PilV, respectively) were only about twofold lower than that between CD147 and its established ligand cyclophilin31 (128 \u00b1 35 pN). These data, consistent with a previously described role for PilE and PilV in Neisseria species pilus-mediated adhesion to host cells9,15,16,17,18, confirm the direct participation of PilE and PilV in the selective interaction of meningococci with CD147.",

These results, which help unravel the molecular basis of a key pathophysiological step of meningococcal diseases, are consistent with previous reports suggesting that, in addition to its structural role in the pilus scaffold, the PilE subunit plays a direct role in bacterial adhesion to host cells15. PilV has also previously been shown to be required for the adhesion of the closely related Neisseria gonorrhoeae18. Interaction with CD147 occurs independently of antigenic variation in the PilE subunit and of possible post-translational modifications. PilE and PilV have relatively low affinities for CD147, whereas multimeric pilins efficiently bind to CD147, indicating a system where avidity is crucial, consistent with the natural organization of pilins in multimeric complexes within pilus fibers. Because endothelial cells, and more particularly brain microvessels, express high levels of CD147, it is likely that CD147 expression level may also contribute to avidity, compensating for the weak affinity of the CD147\u2013meningococcal pilins interaction. How these two pilus components act in concert to create the adhesive phenotype remains to be solved. Identification of the precise PilE and PilV epitopes required for interaction with CD147 will allow the development of targeted antibodies that could prevent type IV pilus\u2013CD147 interaction, opening the path to new vaccine strategies against meningococcal infection.",

Notably, several viruses, including HIV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus37 and measles virus38, as well as the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes39, also target CD147 to adhere to and/or invade epithelial cells, indicating that CD147 constitutes an evolutionarily conserved efficient target for pathogens to infect tissues and spread within organisms. CD147 is also known as EMMPRIN, a master regulator of the production of matrix metalloproteinase40.

Nm2C4.3 expressing pilin variants PilESA, PilESB or GFP were previously described28,43. The pilV mutant was engineered by introduction of an aph3\u2032 resistance cassette into the pilV gene. To complement the pilV mutant, the pilV allele was amplified using primers PilV forward 5\u2032-CCTTAATTAAGGAGTAATTTTATGATGAGTAATAAAATGGAACA-3\u2032 and PilV reverse 5\u2032-CCTTAATTAACTATTTTTTACGATTAGAGAAAGC-3\u2032, containing overhangs with restriction sites for PacI. This PCR fragment was restricted with PacI and cloned into PacI-restricted pGCC4 vector as described before12. This placed pilV under the transcriptional control of an IPTG inducible promoter within a DNA fragment corresponding to an intragenic region of the meningococcal chromosome. This pilV construct was then introduced into the chromosome of the \u0394pilV mutant by homologous recombination. A similar scheme was used for the construction of a complemented PilE isogenic meningococcus strain. The orf of the pilE gene was inserted, in E. coli, at the PacI restriction site of the PGCC4 plasmid. The primers used to amplify PilE were PilE forward 5\u2032-CTTAATTAAGGAGTAATTTATGAACACCCTTCAAAAAGGTTTTAC-3\u2032 and PilE reverse 5\u2032-CTTAATTAATTAGCTGGCAGATGAATCATCGCG-3\u2032. The inducible pilE construct was inserted ectopically into the chromosome of the Nm2C4.3 strain through transformation, using erythromycin for selection. The wild-type pilE locus was subsequently inactivated through transformation of chromosomal DNA of a previously described aphA3\u2013insertionally inactivated endogenous \u0394pilE derivative and selected with kanamycin17. Virtually no PilE could be detected in the absence of induction in the resulting \u0394pilE/pilE strain, whereas induction yielded up to approximately 5% of the wild-type expression level of PilE, as PilE is one of the most strongly constitutively expressed meningococcal proteins. Phenotypically, despite the low level of PilE complementation induced upon IPTG treatment, the functionality of type IV pili expressed upon PilE complementation was ascertained through restoration of competence (competence frequency <1 \u00d7 10\u22127, 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 per \u03bcg DNA for \u0394pilE, \u0394pilE/pilE and wild-type strains, respectively).

MBP-pilins and control proteins (MBP, cyclophilin) were coated on AFM tips using established protocol known to keep protein functionality intact as previously published55,56. All the experiments were performed at room temperature on a commercial AFM (MultiMode8, Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) driven under Nanoscope 8.15. MBP-pilins were used at 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121. Bruker DNP cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 0.06 N/m and a nominal tip radius of 20 nm were used. True cantilever spring constant was determined using Bruker's thermal tune calibration tool. Experiments were done in force-volume mode operating in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0). Pulling speed was set to 10 \u03bcm s\u22121 on 4 \u03bcm2 areas, 300 nm z ramp, with a relative trigger of 150 pN on the cantilever deflection and a contact time of 200 ms. 6,144 force curves per condition were recorded, using at least 6 different tips. Most nonspecific tip-surface adhesion events were automatically discarded from analysis. Force-distance curves were analyzed as previously described55, and binding-unbinding events on the retraction curve were detected according to their shape and size characteristics by a fuzzy logic algorithm fully described in (ref. 57). Briefly, we considered unbinding events based on the vertical segment size, the V-shape and the angle with the baseline. Statistical analysis was performed using R2.15 where provided data are the peak position mean values \u00b1 s.d.",

Human skin tissues were obtained from adult patients undergoing plastic surgery in the Service de Chirurchie Plastique et Reconstructive of the Groupe Hospitalier Saint-Joseph (Paris, France). In accordance with the French legislation, patients were informed and did not refuse to participate in the study. Experimental procedures were performed as previously described32, in accordance with the guidelines of the Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale. The use of human tissue and the experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes (consent form CEEA34.O.J.L.039.12). Briefly, mice were prepared for transplantation by shaving the hair of the back and abdominal areas after they received an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine 100 mg kg\u22121 and xylazine 10 mg kg\u22121. A skin flap was created, and a full-thickness human skin graft was placed onto the wound bed. The transplants were held in place with 6-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture materials, and the flap was then sutured above the transplant. Grafted mice were used for meningococcal infection experiments 1 month after human skin transplantation. Meningococcus strains were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C on GCB agar plates prepared without iron and supplemented with 15 \u03bcM deferoxamine (Desferal, Novartis) with appropriate antibiotic. Bacterial colonies were harvested and cultured in RPMI with 1% bovine serum albumin medium and 0.06 \u03bcM deferoxamine with gentle agitation to reach the exponential phase of growth. Bacteria were then resuspended in physiological saline containing 20 mg ml\u22121 of human holotransferrin to promote bacterial growth in vivo (2914HT, R&D systems). Mice were infected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of this bacterial suspension to minimize the inoculum required to obtain a reproducible high bacteremia in grafted mice. To assess bacteremia in infected animals, 10 \u03bcl of blood was sampled using a heparinized hematocrit glass tube 1 h after injection by puncture in the lateral tail vein, or 18 h after injection by intracardiac puncture on animal killed by intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine. Bacterial counts were performed by plating serial dilutions of blood on GCB agar plates. Results were expressed in colony-forming units (CFU) per ml of blood. Biopsy of human skin grafts were carefully collected using a dermatological punch biopsy system and fixed overnight at 4 \u00b0C in paraformaldehyde 1%, lysin 75 mM and sodium periodate 100 mM in phosphate buffer. After they were washed in phosphate buffer, the specimens were dehydrated in successive sucrose gradient solutions (10%, 20%, 30% prepared in phosphate buffer 0.1 M) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C each, embedded in OCT and then frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. 7-\u03bcm thick sections of the dermis were immobilized on Superfrost plus microscope slides and analyzed via immunofluorescence. Sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies for 2 h in PBS/BSA 0.1%: monoclonal anti-human collagen IV (1/100) and a rabbit polyclonal serum against the Nm2C4.3 strain (1:3,000). DAPI (0.5 mg ml\u22121) was added to Alexa Fluor\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies (1/300) for 1 h. After additional washing, coverslips were mounted in glycergel (Dako). 3 sections per graft were analyzed using epifluorescence (Zeiss Axiovert, 20\u00d7). Quantification analysis of the images (n > 10 per graft) was performed using ImageJ software (NIH).
