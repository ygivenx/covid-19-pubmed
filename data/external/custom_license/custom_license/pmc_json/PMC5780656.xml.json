In our study, the cutoff values that best differentiated mixed bacterial infection pneumonia from viral pneumonia were 1\u00b75 ng/ml for PCT and 10 mg/dl for CRP. The cutoff value for PCT in discriminating bacterial infections from viral infections varies among previous studies: 0\u00b74 ng/ml in a study by Chirouze et al.\n\n19\n 1\u00b70 ng/ml in a study of severe acute respiratory syndrome by Chua et al.\n\n20\n and 0\u00b78 ng/ml in a study by Ingram et al.\n\n13\n The variety in presented cutoff values may be attributed to the presence of a large overlap in PCT concentrations between viral and bacterial infections.\n21\n The utility of PCT and CRP as biomarkers has been discussed in various studies.\n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n And the role of PCT and CRP in discriminating bacterial/mixed infection from 2009 H1N1 pneumonia has been reported in a recent study of 38 patients by Guervilly et al.\n\n12\n and their results showed that only PCT values were statistically higher in patients with mixed bacterial infections.

Our data showed that both PCT and CRP were useful in discriminating viral infection from mixed bacterial infection, with the cutoff was 1\u00b75 ng/ml for PCT, and 10 mg/dl for CRP.

However, indiscriminant antibiotic usage may lead to bacterial resistance and complications of the drug itself. Therefore, the decision when to stop empirical antibiotics during the course of influenza undoubtedly possesses problems. Wright et al.\n\n25\n described diffuse infiltration on chest X\u2010ray and leukopenia in favoring infections caused by influenza alone, and lobar infiltration and leukocytosis in favoring mixed bacterial infections. However, discrimination of mixed bacterial infection from influenza infection by this method would not be possible in most cases during a pandemic. In our study, no significant differences in radiographic findings were found. Furthermore, WBC, absolute neutrophil count, and lymphocyte counts were not significantly different between the two groups. Therefore, clinicians cannot rely on radiographic findings or blood cell counts. Inflammatory markers including serum PCT and CRP concentrations are required to aid in the diagnosis and discrimination of the different types of pneumonia. According to the management protocols of H1N1 influenza at our institute, all patients were initially administered oseltamivir and prophylactic antibiotics, and in this setting, combination of a low PCT and low CRP may be useful to reduce the duration of antibiotic administration.",

PCT determination is not covered by medical insurance in Korea; therefore, cost was a prohibitive factor in the routine use of this biomarker during follow\u2010up. We also acknowledge that, by limiting mixed infection group to those in whom microbiologically confirmed bacterial diagnosis was made, we may have created a bias.
