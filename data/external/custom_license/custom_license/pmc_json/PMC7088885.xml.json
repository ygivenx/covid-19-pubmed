The viral genome consists of a ~16 kb long negative sense RNA encapsidated by nucleocapsid protein (N-RNA). Transcription of viral N-RNA occurs in an orderly fashion from the 3\u2032 end of N-RNA; 3\u2032-le-N-P-M-F-H-L-tr-5\u2032. Excluding the 52 nt 3\u2032 leader RNA, all the other mRNAs are capped and methylated similar to cellular mRNA. Viruses of this family replicate inside the cytoplasm of the infected cells and hence, are not dependent on the host enzymes located in the nucleus for the post-transcriptional modification of viral mRNA. During transcription, the viral mRNAs are capped similar to the cellular mRNA, although the extent of methylation differs within the viruses belonging to this family. The direct evidence for the belief that the large protein L of Paramyxoviruses is responsible for mRNA synthesis, capping and cap methylation came from the work of Ogino et al. [12] who showed that the recombinant L protein of Sendai virus possesses guanine-7-methyl transferase activity located within the C-terminal part of L protein. Multiple sequence alignment and secondary sequence analysis predicted the presence of 2\u2032-O-methyl transferase domain in C- terminal domain of L protein of mononegavirale [6].",

Sequence alignment of RPV L protein with 2\u2032-O-methyl transferase from other species revealed the conservation of KDKE tetrad suggesting the presence of this motif in domain III of RPV L protein (Fig. 1a). In addition, we also found the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding motif GXGXG within residues 1789\u20131795 conserved across Morbillivirus genus (Fig. 1b). Considering the presence of both KDKE tetrad, responsible for 2\u2032-O-methyl transferase as well as GXGXG motif for SAM substrate binding, domain III could likely represent the methyl transfer module (both N7-guanine and 2\u2032-O-methyl) of RPV L protein.

To test, if RPL L protein possesses methyltransferase activity in addition to capping, we incubated 6b capped viral RNA with partially purified L\u2013P complex. Digestion of the substrate alone with P1 nuclease released a product, which co-migrated with the GpppA (cap) marker (Fig. 2b, labelled as C). Incubation of the capped RNA with the partially purified L\u2013P complex from insect cells resulted in a concentration dependent N7 guanine methylation of 6 bp substrate (Fig. 2b, marked as rL) which was not detected in a mock-purified high-density fraction from insect cells infected with non-recombinant baculovirus (Fig. 2b, mock).

            "text": "Though L protein is believed to possess all the activities required for the post-transcriptional modification of the viral mRNA, due to its size, it has been proposed to function in a modular fashion to carry out different enzymatic activities associated with viral mRNA synthesis and maturation [3]. In agreement, putative 2\u2032-O-methyl transferase (MTase) motif was predicted within domain VI (1753\u20131830 aa) of L proteins [1]. In another report, a structural homology-based comparison was carried out between bacterial 2\u2032-O-MTase, Rrmj and the region spanning 1644\u20131842 aa of VSV L protein, and further mutational analysis revealed the importance of this region in viral mRNA transcription as well as methylation [6]. However, recent evidences point out the importance of regions in domain II of VSV L protein in both cap 0 and cap 1 methylation [9].",

In support of this observation, Ogino et al. [12] have shown that Sendai virus L protein deletion mutant spanning the domain III alone (aa 1756\u20132228) catalyses cap 0 methyl transferase activity, while inclusion of a portion of domain II (aa 1121\u20132228) resulted in significantly higher activity. These results suggest that in paramyxovirus L protein (compared to rhabdo viruses), the catalytic module for cap 0 methyl transferase activity resides in domain III, and domain II may have additional role of stabilizing the enzyme or increase the catalytic efficiency.",

Although the RPV L protein was found to possess the KDKE motif, the catalytic motif for 2\u2032-O-methyl transferases, the generation of Cap 1 (7mGpppAm) product could not be seen. One likely reason could be that the presence of cap 0 is a mandatory prerequisite for RPV L protein to generate cap 1 structures. In support of this, coronavirus nonstructural protein 16 was found to exhibit 2\u2032-O-methyl transferase activity only on N7GpppA substrate RNA, while Flavivirus NS5 methyl transferase can catalyse the methylation of both GpppA and N7GpppA substrates [2, 4]. Alternatively, lack of domain II may render domain III catalytically inactive with respect to 2\u2032-O-methylation [9]. Hence, it would be interesting to speculate that RPV L protein may also require specific N7GpppA substrate RNA to exhibit 2\u2032-O-methyl transferase activity although further experiments are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n",
