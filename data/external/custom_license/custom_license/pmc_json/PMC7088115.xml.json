The primary goal is to facilitate what-if-analysis that will allow the formulation of public health strategies in the event of infectious disease epidemics. It is essential to recognize that the dynamics of an epidemic are tightly coupled with the geography and demographics of a region in which an outbreak has manifested itself. This suggests that results that have been obtained by analyzing a disease outbreak in one particular geographic location may not be readily applicable when defining control and prevention strategies in other regions. Similarly, one must recognize that comparison of morbidity/mortality of two or more past epidemics for the purpose of deciding control measures must take demographic changes during these years into consideration. Further, this necessitates the availability of computational tools, which enable epidemiologists to model an outbreak by bringing together knowledge of disease, geography, and demographics from past and present.",

For example, changes in socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and demand for appropriate living conditions and health-care services, as the geographical pattern of the elderly in many American cities has changed considerably in the past decade. Unfortunately the nature of this change is not clearly documented and still being studied. Some states are more attractive to elderly. However, limited research exists on association between an extensive set of location-specific factors and the migration of retirement-age individuals. For instance, Duncombe et al. (2003) estimated an individual-level location-choice model by using a combination of place-characteristics data and Census county-to-county migration data, identifying income taxes to have the largest relative effects. However, other factors, including climate, economic conditions, and population characteristics, appear to play much larger roles in migration and location decisions. Such findings may provide clues to understanding geographic distribution and the change in the level of health care demands, particularly in the context of aging America. Understanding of the temporal pattern of the geographic distribution of the population, including the urban elderly, will provide insight into the future trends and facilitate strategic planning of needed services. Disease surveillance systems based on antiquated demographic data are inadequate. Thus, examining and evaluating the appropriateness of current community services available to the elderly is critical for identifying and eliminating gaps in service.",

In general, areas of high in-migration are also characterized by high out-migration, and there is substantial regional variation in mobility rates. Hence, disease data and disease prevalence projections based on human interaction patterns, are easily and quickly outdated if there are significant changes in demographics resulting from migration or urbanization. Population structure plays an important role in determining the spreading patterns of infectious diseases among humans, forcing us to consider meta-population models making an explicit distinction between the intra- and inter-community interactions (Sattenspiel and Dietz 1995). Environmental factors associated with the location of contact can have important effects on transmission risk. For instance, a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina has led to drastic changes in the demography in the New Orleans as well as in surrounding states.",

            "text": "Public health policy and disaster preparedness has often relied on historical data of past epidemics. This is particularly true for the comparison of specific epidemics on the basis of the associated attack-rate or reproduction number R\n0, as used by Longini et al. (2005) to develop strategies for containing pandemic influenza. R\n0 is the expected (average) number of new infectious individuals in a completely susceptible population produced by a single infectious individual during their entire period of infectiousness. Accordingly, when R\n0 > 1, an epidemic occurs in a completely susceptible population; if R\n0 < 1, the disease dies out and cannot establish itself in the population (Ferguson et al. 2005). Traditionally, R\n0 was computed directly from the equations that form the SIR-type models used to describe disease dynamics in a homogeneous population. More recently, the attack rate R\n0 of a specific infectious disease has been determined by analyzing data that has been collected during the epidemic (Glass et al. 2006). As discussed above, interaction patterns are a function of changing demographics and infrastructure in response to migration and urbanization. Thus, to be able to analyze and compare past epidemics to present ones, the R\n0 of a past outbreak must be adjusted to account for such changes. This necessitates the analysis of how past disease outbreaks may have manifested themselves in the corresponding demographics. The displacement of individuals caused by Hurricane Katrina, for instance, is therefore an important factor that must be taken into consideration when predicting or planning for potential epidemics. GSFS facilitates the prediction of how infectious disease outbreaks will manifest in the current demographics through the simulation of contacts, which are deemed the primary determinant of an epidemic\u2019s dynamics.",

Susceptibles are those individuals in a population who can be infected by the disease under study. Infectives are those individuals who have been infected and are infectious. Removals include all individuals that are incapable of transmitting the infection, and are either recovering, fully recovered or expired from the disease. In complex models, the removals who recover may revert to susceptibles, leading to a SIS model, if the exposure to the disease does not result in lifelong immunity. The Kermack\u2013McKendrick Threshold Theorem (Bailey 1957) is the basis for the SIR model. A continuous influx of susceptibles is a requisite for sustained infection in a population. The model is based on the presumption of a closed homogeneous population, assuming that the epidemic spreads sufficiently fast such that the changes brought in by births, deaths, migration and demographic changes are negligible (Aron 2000).",

(2000) have developed a lattice gas cellular automata model to analyze the spread of epidemics of infectious diseases. This model, however, does not consider the critical factor of infection time-line. Fu (2002, 2003) has used stochastic cellular automata to model epidemic outbreaks that take into account the spatial heterogeneity. Situngkir (2004) has developed a dynamic model of spatial epidemiology to study avian influenza disease in Indonesia and uses cellular automata for computational analysis. Naive cellular automata are impeded by a limited neighborhood, and the social interactions based on demographics are not readily incorporated. The authors have introduced the global stochastic cellular automata paradigm, addressing the issue of limited neighborhood in a classical CA (Mikler et al. 2005). In order to overcome the limitations posed by naive cellular automata, we introduce GSFM, which incorporates the demographics of location and population density. The current models can be potentially extended to include geography, demographics, and social dynamics, nevertheless, the drastic increase in intrinsic complexity may render the model computationally infeasible. The restrictions and scalability limitations of the current models will be addressed by the proposed computational framework for modeling infectious diseases. This framework will complement the current existing methodologies with studies of heterogeneous population, including dynamic interactions based on geography, demography, environment and migration patterns.",

            "text": "Spatially delineated regions with a small (<< 10,000) population can be constructed using an agent-based approach, in which each individual is represented by an autonomous agent (Mikler et al. 2004). Larger models with millions of agents necessitate the use of large computing clusters or grid computing that can provide the necessary computational power. The parameters that control interactions among individuals are generally pre-determined through social science research when a population\u2019s real-world mixing patterns are studied. The agent based model is then used to understand the progression of diseases in a simulated agent society by observing the emergent behavior of the epidemic. Real work mixing patterns and social interactions can be modeled by social networks, which have become increasingly important in our understanding of complex networks and the epidemic spread of diseases in the real world. A social network is a social structure made of nodes each representing individuals or organizations. Links indicate the ways in which individuals or groups are connected through various social familiarities ranging from casual acquaintance to close familial bonds. The term social network was first coined in 1954 by Barness (1954). Much research has been conducted in the past half century on social networks; however, only in the last decade have researchers in a variety of domains (i.e., computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians) become interested in this field. Complex networks are comprised of lattice-type, small-world and scale-free network structures. Social networks have many of the same properties as other real world networks such as degree distribution. However, one of the large differences between a social network and other complex networks (i.e. topology of the Internet) is network transitivity (Barabasi et al. 2002). The clustering in social networks occur with greater frequency than pure chance, or more casually \u201cparty people party together\". Examples of social networks include scientific collaboration networks, friendship networks in the blogosphere, and networks of human contacts (Barabasi et al. 2002; Flake et al. 2000; Liljeros et al. 2001]. Applying methods in social network analysis to public health and epidemiology has grown in the recent years. Some of these methods include agent-based simulation to model the spread of infection on a population (Eubank 2002) and targeted social distancing to mitigate influenza attack rates. An interesting extension to the work by Glass et al. (2006) would be to not only mitigate attack rate by targeted social distancing but to borrow the concept of min-cuts from graph theory to determine an epidemic distance in the social network and target responses in those areas with maximum flow of infection. Applying social network analysis to problems in population-health has many exciting open research opportunities in the future. However, a cumulative modeling error that may be introduced when the number of individuals increases may grow prohibitively and thus it is essential to represent members of society with high fidelity, as attainable by behavioral statistics. Agent-based models have been used to analyze HIV/AIDS spread in the population and individual immune levels following the infection (Callaghan 2005). A survey of agent-based epidemic simulation models is available (Bagni et al. 2002). BioWar (2004) is an agent-based system that analyzes the disease spread, treatment, and recovery, by porting principles of interactions from social, knowledge and work networks. The authors have applied agent-based models to analyze real world outbreaks of tuberculosis in factory and homeless shelter settings (Mikler et al. 2004; Oppong et al. 2004).",

Probabilistic and stochastic analysis are integral to Bayesian methodologies and give a closer view of the real world compared with rule-based systems. Bayesian learning has been successfully applied in the areas of medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, gaming, and fault diagnosis. Nevertheless, in the field of modeling epidemics and their analysis, the Bayesian paradigm has been rarely utilized to its full potential. In the Amazon region, where onchocerciasis (river blindness) is endemic, Bayesian reasoning has been used to identify communities that needed priority ivermectin treatment (Carabin et al. 2003). Spiegelhalter et al. (1999) investigated the utility of Bayesian analysis for health technology assessment and highlighted its practical advantages in handling complex inter-related problems. Bayesian monitoring of critical factors in cancer related clinical trials, such as toxicity and quality of life measures, led to higher accuracy (Fayers et al. 1997). An epidemiological model using Bayesian analysis has been developed for malaria in Ndiop, Senegal (Cancre et al. 2000). The authors have used Bayesian learning to infer the dependency of disease incidence on the demographics in different geographic regions (Abbas et al. 2004).",

Table 3 shows the total number of infected individuals in the population for index cases in different age groups. An index case in the elderly age group does not result in a spread of the disease, whereas one index case in the Youths/Young Adult age group triggers an epidemic. We postulate that the different behavior as represented by different contact rate in these groups facilitate the spread of the disease and thus the manifestation of an epidemic. Nevertheless, it is important to note that GSFS is based on a Monte Carlo methodology, thus any results should be interpreted as trends, rather than expected outcome as result of specific parameter choices.\n",

The infectivity of a strain is an important factor that determines the dynamics of disease spread. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the prevalence of influenza-like illness for varied levels of infectivity. Figure 6 illustrates that incidence decreases for lower levels of infectivity. The remaining parameters were similar to that of the basic experiments described above. This experiment exemplifies the sensitivity of the infectivity parameter. As this parameter is primarily related to the disease dynamics, it has been maintained uniform across different age groups.\n",

The results obtained from this model represent the severity of an epidemic over time, allowing an epidemiologist to quantify the incidence and prevalence, as computed by GSFS, in response to employing different public health policies (e.g., vaccination strategies). In addition to comparing and quantifying different outbreak scenarios, the experimental analysis of GSFS revealed that an epidemic as observed by health care providers and public health officials, is the cumulative effect of multiple spatially and temporally distributed small outbreaks as shown in Fig. 7. In the context of influenza-like illnesses, the temporal-spatial progression of the disease account for cases that are observed by health care providers during a flu season. Clearly, population density and specific age strata are important demographic parameters that will determine how the disease will manifest itself in a particular sub-region. For instance, the infectious period for influenza in young children is known to exceed that of adults. Hence, one could expect cells (or sub-regions) with a larger proportion of children to display an increased prevalence of influenza as compared to regions with a larger proportion of adult population. Further, it is known that children are the primary transmitters of influenza. Consequently, one might hypothesize that the composition model will yield results that reflect an accelerated spread among regions with larger proportion of children. The model can be used to investigate the spread of disease in each location and the spread of infection from one location to the other. Analyzing the order of local outbreaks may help identify a set of highly probable paths the epidemic may take in the population at large. This will facilitate the identification of high risk groups and prevalence among particular regions, which will aid in the formulation of surveillance and control measures.\n",

            "text": "The prediction of how an infectious disease outbreak may manifest itself in a given population and whether or not prevalence will rise to epidemic or pandemic proportions has eluded public health experts. Most predictions are based on past records of epidemics that have occurred in different regions with different demographics. Modeling such outbreaks either mathematically or by means of simulation paradigms such as cellular automata and other methodologies have primarily focused on disease spread with respect to the infection or virulence of the disease in homogeneous populations. The GSFS paradigm is the basis for modeling outbreaks of infectious diseases in populations with varied demographic characteristics. That is, GSFS facilitates the analysis of disease progression in heterogeneous environments, and can incorporate geographic and demographic parameters into the model. In order to quantify public health policies in preparation for potential epidemics, predictive tools are required that can facilitate the what-if-analysis of different surveillance and control methodologies. This requires the analysis of how past disease epidemics have manifested themselves in their region with corresponding demographics. These results must then be mapped to predict the disease dynamics in current and future demographics. This paper demonstrates some of the features of GSFS through an experimental analysis of the incidence and prevalence of an influenza-like illness for parts of Denton County, Texas. From the analysis it is evident that regional demographics are an important aspect when modeling disease outbreak and making decisions about policies to address infectious diseases. GSFS facilitates the identification of high risk groups in the population and adequate points of control, leading to more effective surveillance and control of infectious disease epidemics. Analysis of age as one of the population characteristics has revealed that disease spread patterns changes with different demographics. To this end, GSFS shall prove to be a valuable asset in the analysis of progression of infectious diseases, thereby leading to optimal utilization of public health resources. As the computational demand of simulating epidemics across multiple regions grows significantly, the use of high-performance computing infrastructure must be considered and public health professionals must be prepared to incorporate computational science methodologies into their repertoire of tools.",
