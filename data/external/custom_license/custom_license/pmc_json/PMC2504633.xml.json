            "text": "Acoustic trauma is one of the most common causes of hearing loss, and over many years noise has been used experimentally to improve our understanding of the normal function, abnormal function, and repair processes of the cochlea. A predictable series of morphologic and functional changes occurs in the cochlea following acoustic trauma (Robertson and Johnstone, 1980; Ou et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2002). The physiologic and histopathologic changes that accompany threshold shift have been well studied. In previous reports on ultrastructural changes associated with acoustic overexposure, various authors have described a phagocytic cell population that appears in the scala media and phagocytoses debris after hair cells are disrupted (Fredelius 1988; Fredelius and Rask-Andersen 1990). In further investigation of this phagocytic cell population, we have discovered that a robust inflammatory response occurs after noise. Mononuclear phagocytes are recruited to the scala media and to the lateral wall in the basal turn of the cochlea in large numbers after acoustic injury (Hirose et al. 2005). In this paper, we described the distribution of mononuclear phagocytes in the cochlea and characterized their cell surface markers by using immunohistochemistry. These inflammatory cells populated the membranous labyrinth in small numbers in the native cochlea but seven days after noise, they were abundant in the spiral ligament, spiral ganglion, and spiral limbus, concentrating mostly in the inferior portion of the spiral ligament. They also expressed CD45, CD68, Iba-1 (microglial and macrophage marker), and CX3CR1 (fractalkine receptor).",

CX3CR1 is expressed on a number of myeloid cells including microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as natural killer cells and activated T cells. In addition, 90\u201395% of cochlear cells that are CD45+, which are by definition leukocytes, express CX3CR1. In addition, GFP expressing cells in CX3CR1+/GFP mice are shown to phagocytose debris in the injured cochlea. Therefore, the CX3CR1+/GFP mouse has been clearly demonstrated to label cochlear mononuclear phagocytes that are best described as tissue macrophages (Hirose et al. 2005). This mouse has been shown to be useful in identifying these cells not only in the cochlea, but in the central nervous system and in the hematopoietic system as well.",

            "text": "Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, designated as CCL2 in the revised nomenclature, is a member of the CC family of chemokines. CCL2 and its primary receptor, CCR2, are the most widely validated effectors of monocyte chemotaxis in vivo (Ransohoff 2002; Rollins 1996). CCL2\u2212/\u2212 and CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice have been extensively used for studies of monocyte function in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Ambati et al. 2003; Dzenko et al. 2001; Han et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2001; Izikson et al. 2000; Mahad and Ransohoff 2003; Peterson et al. 2004; Siebert et al. 2000; Sorensen et al. 2004). However, CCL2 and CCR2 have not been studied in the inner ear. The present study addresses the role of CCL2 and CCR2 in the process of monocyte recruitment and hair cell survival after acoustic injury. First, by using quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that CCL2 gene expression is markedly increased in the cochlea after acoustic injury. This finding suggests that CCL2 may play an important role in monocyte migration and activation after acoustic injury. Then, we performed detailed physiologic, histologic/stereologic analysis of CCL2 and CCR2 knockout mice after noise exposure.",

All three mouse strains were maintained on C57Bl6 background. Physiologic and morphologic studies of these three mouse strains demonstrated equivalent baseline hearing thresholds, hair cell numbers, and cochlear macrophage numbers prior to experimental noise exposure. After acoustic injury, CCL2 knockout mice had comparable functional and morphological outcomes to the background strain, CX3CR1+/GFP. Surprisingly, neither CCL2\u2212/\u2212 nor CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice were monocyte depleted after noise exposure. However, CCR2 knockout mice demonstrated the vulnerability of hair cells that was significantly more severe than either the ligand knockout (CCL2\u2212/\u2212) or the background strain.

Stimuli were 5-ms tone pips with alternating polarity that were raised in 5-dB steps from 10 dB SPL to a maximum of 95 dB SPL. A total of 1024 responses were recorded and averaged for each SPL at each frequency. Responses of > 15 \u03bcV correlate to the electrocardiogram or gross muscle movement and were rejected as artifact. Thresholds were determined by a single observer who examined the tracings, stacked by increasing stimulus intensity. The lowest stimulus level at which a recognizable waveform could be discerned was reported as threshold. If hearing threshold was not detected at 95 dB, a threshold value of 99 dB was assigned. For statistical analysis of ABR data, pure tone averages at 8, 16, 32, and 64 kHz (four out nine of the tested frequencies) were calculated, and differences between strains were analyzed using paired t-test.",

The melting curve was 65\u00b0C for 15 s, 1 cycle with cooling at 4\u00b0C. SYBR green is a reporter molecule that emits fluorescence when incorporated into double-stranded DNA. Increase in fluorescence intensity is reflective of product accumulation. The number of PCR cycles required to reach log phase in growth of fluorescence is inversely proportional to the original quantity of mRNA of the gene of interest. Expression of each specific gene is normalized to the expression of GAPDH, a housekeeping gene whose expression in the cochlea is not altered by noise.",

Twenty-four hours after noise exposure, maximum CCL2 expression was noted with a 150-fold increase in CCL2 over control expression in the mouse cochlea. A period of 24 h represents the time point at which there was maximal CCL2 expression. By 48 h after noise exposure, CCL2 expression returned to control levels. The maximum up-regulation of CCL2 mRNA expression at 24 h precedes the induction of monocyte migration, which occurs at day 3, thus suggesting a possible chemotactic signaling role for CCL2. Macrophage numbers in the cochlea peak at seven days after noise exposure (Hirose et al. 2005). Thus, the timing of CCL2 expression was appropriate as a possible chemotactic signal for monocyte migration in the cochlea and provided motivation for studies on CCL2\u2212/\u2212 and CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

            "text": "It appears likely that redundant function of other CCR2 ligands accounts for the unchanged phenotype in the CCL2\u2212/\u2212 mouse after acoustic injury. As CCR2 is capable of binding other CC chemokines, we suspect that the ligand-dependent activity of CCR2 is mediated by other CC chemokines, particularly when CCL2 is deleted from the time of conception. Recently presented data showed that CCL7 and CCL2 play a differential and nonredundant function in monocyte release from the bone marrow. CCR2 has clearly been shown to be important in release of monocytes into the peripheral vasculature, but this does not rely on CCL2, but on CCL7 binding to the CCR2 receptor (Charo 2006). Likewise, CCL7 may play an important role in binding and activating CCR2, thus providing cochlear protection after noise. Both CCL7 and CCL12 were found to be significantly up-regulated after noise by quantitative real-time PCR although at lower levels than CCL2. In cochleas of CCL2\u2212/\u2212 mice, CCL7 and CCL12 remained up-regulated, although it appears that loss of CCL2 expression does not result in compensation by CCL7 or CCL12 as the expression levels of all three chemokines are higher in the wild-type mouse (Shick et al. 2006). If CCL7 is the effector molecule for the observed sensitivity to noise conferred by lack of CCR2 expression, this mechanism could provide an explanation for the observed changes in hair cell vulnerability to noise in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice and not in CCL2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5).\n",

At this time, we are uncertain as to whether cochlear macrophages limit their activity to phagocytosis, whether they mediate further cochlear injury, or serve a neuroprotective role after acoustic trauma. One approach to study this question is to suppress macrophage recruitment and determine how the outcome differs. We considered the CCL2/CCR2 ligand/receptor pair to be a plausible target in down-regulating macrophage recruitment as we detected a large increase in CCL2 expression after acoustic trauma. Furthermore, studies in the central nervous system using trauma, immune-mediated inflammation, and viral infection as models have indicated that monocyte migration is effectively suppressed by eliminating CCL2 or CCR2.",

It appears that other chemokine/receptor pairs are capable of replacing the functions of CCL2 and CCR2, particularly when this pair is absent preceding development. Furthermore, we were not able to create a condition in which threshold elevation was different between genotypes. We used two different noise levels for the CCL2\u2212/\u2212CX3CR1+/GFP mice and both noise levels produced similar threshold shifts.

            "text": "Nevertheless, the CCR2 knockout mouse did yield interesting results with regard to hair cell survival. While deleting CCR2 had no obvious effects on monocyte migration, its deletion clearly had an effect on hair cell survival. After CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice are exposed to a 112-dB octave band of noise at 8\u201316 kHz, there is a dramatic loss of hair cells in the corresponding frequency region of the cochlea. This lesion in the sensory epithelium is much larger and more consistent than lesions seen in the ears of the background strain CX3CR1+/GFP or in the CCL2\u2212/\u2212CX3CR1+/GFP strain. The degree of hair cell loss in the high-frequency region is also more severe in the CCR2\u2212/\u2212CX3CR1+/GFP when compared with the other two genotypes. Therefore, it appears that CCR2 may play a protective role in the cochlea either through some mechanism related to macrophages in the ear or via independent CCR2 expression on endogenous cells within the cochlea itself. CCR2 is expressed on monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, activated T cells, basophils, and natural killer cells. CCR2 may also be expressed in other cells, particularly in native cells of the ear. Its expression pattern is important to establish, a task that will become possible when a suitable antibody is available. Characterization of which cell types express CCR2 will provide us with insight into the mechanism of CCR2-mediated protection against acoustic overstimulation.",

            "text": "Studies in other organ systems have led to a hypothesis that CCR2 could play an antiapoptotic or prosurvival role in the face of both infectious and toxic challenges. In acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, CCR2 appears to play a protective role (Hogaboam et al. 2000). Liver damage caused by acetaminophen overdose is exacerbated in CCR2 knockout mice when compared to wild-type mice. Both wild-type and CCR2 null mice produced elevated CCL2 levels in the liver after drug exposure. However, CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice experienced damage to the liver at a lower drug dose than when compared to wild-type mice. CCR2 mice had significant TUNEL labeling of hepatocytes when wild-type mice demonstrated no cell death and no TUNEL labeling. It is postulated that CCR2 plays an important role in attenuating apoptotic cell death, possibly via interactions with proinflammatory cytokines that are elaborated in response to acetaminophen. Another condition in which CCR2 appears to be protective is in pulmonary tuberculosis. CCR2-dependent trafficking of macrophages, again, independent of CCL2, appears to be an important part of protection of the lung against mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Peters et al. 2004). The protective effect of CCR2 in these experiments does appear linked to CCR2-mediated macrophage and dendritic cell migration to the lungs and their role in defense against infection.",

This effect was associated with higher levels of caspase 3 activation and increased glial apoptosis in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to wild-type s and CCL2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Muessel et al. 2002). The differences in outcome between the ligand and receptor knockout in this experimental paradigm suggest that the interactions between these two molecules are complex and that ligands other than CCL2 are physiologically important ligands for CCR2. Another study that arrives at a similar conclusion is one in which coronavirus infection in the central nervous system is studied in CCL2\u2212/\u2212 and CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Held et al. 2004). Held et al. found that CCR2, but not CCL2, is important in the immune response to infection of the brain and postulated that another CCR2 ligand, other than CCL2, is providing this protective effect.",

Data from work on nociception demonstrate that chemokine receptors are present not only on macrophages and microglia of the nervous system, but also on neurons themselves. Ligand binding of these chemokine receptors can result in depolarization of sensory neurons (Boddeke 2001). Further studies have demonstrated that CC chemokine receptors can associate with TRPV1 (vanilloid receptor 1) to open calcium channels or modify the sensitivity of voltage gated ion channels to receptor binding, thereby increasing nociception (Zhang et al. 2005). It is therefore feasible that if CCR2 is expressed on sensory cells of the ear, this receptor could mediate its protective effect by modifying the hair cells\u2019 direct response to acoustic stimulation.",

There are three cell types in the cochlea that may express CCR2 and could be instrumental in CCR2-mediated neuroprotection. The cochlear macrophage is the first and most apparent candidate. The cochlear macrophage, described in a previous paper, has been shown to express surface antigens consistent with other tissue macrophages and may also express CCR2. Clearly, if the cochlear macrophage expresses CCR2, it is not reliant on this receptor for recruitment to the ear as the CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mouse demonstrates normal macrophage migration after acoustic injury. However, CCR2 may be important in programming the macrophage once it has arrived on site to effect what protective or reparative role it plays. The second possible candidates are the sensory cells themselves. As numerous investigators now have shown, neurons themselves can express CCR2, and ligand binding of CCR2 can result in direct changes in calcium currents and sensitivity to neurotransmitter binding and release (White et al. 2005). It is possible that hair cells or supporting cells express CCR2, and the protective effect of CCR2 relies on antiapoptotic signals to the sensory cells directly. Finally, the microvascular endothelial cells may possess CCR2, and ligand binding here may result in recruitment or repulsion of other peripheral leukocytes that by some mechanism could provide protection to the cochlea after macrophage recruitment.",
