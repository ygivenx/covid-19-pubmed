MAwt, which causes increased mortality and acute respiratory distress in young and aged mouse models22\u201324, and MA-ExoN were compared in growth experiments (MOI = 0.1 PFU cell\u22121). MA-ExoN displayed a stable <1-log growth defect (Fig. 1c). When placed in direct competition, MA-ExoN was clearly less fit than MAwt over successive rounds of infection (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were roughly equivalent at 6 h post-infection (p.i.) to those of MAwt and were reduced at 12 h p.i., but MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were approximately 10% that of MAwt levels by 24 h p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus, the data suggest that MA-ExoN is able to initiate and establish replication efficiently through times of peak RNA synthesis (0\u20136 h) but is impaired in accumulation, which manifests late in one round of infection and is amplified over multiple rounds. The results are consistent with accumulating defects resulting from a profoundly increased mutation rate (see Discussion).",

Young mice infected with MAwt exhibited dose-dependent weight loss and recovery (Fig. 2a), though there were no observable dose-dependent differences in lung titers or clearance after d 4 p.i. (Fig. 2b). In contrast, young mice infected with MA-ExoN exhibited no signs of clinical disease and had high but not dose-dependent lung titers that were rapidly cleared by d 4 p.i. (Fig. 2a, b). Next, MA-ExoN and MAwt were compared in aged, immunosenescent mice25. Animals infected with both viruses exhibited dose-dependent weight loss (Fig. 2c), but while lung titers were equivalent across doses in MA-ExoN and MAwt infections on d 2, MA-ExoN-infected mice cleared virus independent of inoculation dose, while MAwt-infected mice cleared virus more efficiently at d 4 in higher-titer infections (Fig. 2d) Additionally, while aged mice infected with MA-ExoN experienced no mortality, MAwt-infected mice experienced dose-dependent mortality (Fig. 2e). As described previously23, little if any virus was detected in other organs. These experiments demonstrate that MA-ExoN is attenuated in both young and aged disease models compared to virulent MAwt and that disease symptoms, when present, are less pronounced in MA-ExoN infections than in MAwt infections.",

            "text": "A potential concern with live-attenuated vaccines is the chance that they could revert to virulence in vivo, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, we assessed whether MA-ExoN was attenuated in immunocompromised mice. MAwt and MA-ExoN were used to infect young Rag (Recombination Activating Gene) \u2212/ \u2212, SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency), and Stat1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1) \u2212/ \u2212 mice, including background controls (C57BL/6, BALB/c, and 129, respectively). In all cases, MA-ExoN-infected animals experienced significantly less weight loss than MAwt-infected mice (Fig. 3a\u2013c; P < 0.05, see Supplementary Table 1). Only Stat1\u2212/\u2212 mice experienced any notable weight loss (~15%) due to MA-ExoN infection; however, experimental morbidity thresholds were not passed (Fig. 3c). In contrast, all MAwt-infected Stat1\u2212/ \u2212 mice died or were moribund by d 9 p.i., but MAwt infection was not lethal in C57BL/6 or 129 control mice (Fig. 3a, c), as previously reported22,26. Rag\u2212/ \u2212 and SCID mice both maintained detectable levels of MAwt and MA-ExoN virus for 14 d (Rag\u2212/ \u2212) or 60 d (SCID) beyond what was measured in the background controls (Fig. 3d, e) but showed no signs of illness over the course of the experiment, despite the lack of viral clearance, expanding earlier reports from our laboratory that MAwt did not clear from Rag\u2212/ \u2212 mice26. The rapid clearance of MA-ExoN infection from Stat1\u2212/ \u2212 animals (Fig. 3f) further supports the hypothesis that clearance of SARS-CoV infection is B- and T-cell-dependent27.",

Mutation accumulations were significantly higher in MA-ExoN-infected mice for both regions (P < 0.01). Additionally, there was a mean 18.3-fold accumulation increase for MA-ExoN across the ORF1a region. When accumulations of mutations were normalized per 10 kb, MA-ExoN mutation accumulations in ORF1a vs. ORF1b regions were not significantly different (P = 0.340) but remained significantly increased compared to MAwt (P < 0.001 for both ORF1a and ORF1b). No new mutations were identified in all three MA-ExoN plaques, suggesting no obligatory or consistent pattern of adaptation or mutational bias.

In contrast, while MAwt titer remained stable over 24-h serial passage, mice inoculated with 72-h lung homogenates died by d 3 in passage 2 (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, while MA-ExoN titer remained stable over the 72-h passage, mouse weights did not decrease during infection after passage 1 (Fig. 5c). Importantly, there was no evidence of a gain of virulence over serial passage in the MA-ExoN pathogenesis model: when aged mice were infected with lung homogenates from each of the final 24-h and 72-h passages, mice infected with MA-ExoN passages lost no or little weight, and MAwt-infected animals became moribund (Fig. 5d).",

However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that both stable and evolving defects resulting from the mutator phenotype have irrevocably attenuated MA-ExoN. These defects could include: 1) mutations that impair or terminate translation, replication, and transcription; 2) mutations that impair or abolish protein functions; and 3) changes in RNA polymerase processivity in the presence of an inactivated proofreading exonuclease. These combined impairments may be profoundly manifested with CoV ExoN mutants, as the high number of accumulated mutations per genome is unprecedented among viral mutator strains. Indeed, the phenotype is similar to those reported for model systems with inactivated exonucleases, such as the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 (pol \u03b3)32,33 and bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase34\u201336. In pol \u03b3 studies, the loss of proofreading was associated with impaired polymerase activity in a manner that is likely causal, impossible to uncouple, and characterized by decreased speed, increased template dissociation, and restricted access of nucleotides to the polymerase active site32,33. For CoVs, the high levels of iterative amplification of both genomic and subgenomic RNA would further accelerate these deleterious processes by providing aberrant templates. The loss of ExoN proofreading would continuously generate new potentially attenuating alleles and defective genomes and would reduce both genome fitness (Supplementary Fig. 1) and the risks for primary and secondary reversions to virulence.",

Viruses harvested after passage remained avirulent, supporting conclusions that: 1) selection for virulence is not occurring; 2) selection is being outcompeted by the gradual accumulation of attenuating mutations in individual genomes or the in the population mutational swarm; or 3) the mutant is unable to generate or select for either fast-growing or slow-clearing viruses that are also more virulent. Not surprisingly, a limited number of polymorphisms (Supplementary Table 3) were identified in the MA-ExoN virus stock that was used in subsequent experiments. Viruses with and without these mutations were fully attenuated in vivo (Fig. 5f), and the mutations were also maintained in lungs in the same frequencies as they were in the virus stock, suggesting that they were not selected against during passage in vivo (Supplementary Table 2).

We have demonstrated that MA-ExoN possesses both of these characteristics. In all circumstances, the engineered inactivation mutations were maintained, indicating that exonuclease activity is not critical for the virus life cycle and that the 4-nt, 2-aa change presents a substantial barrier to primary reversion; further, the passage experiments suggest that the virus lacks redundant or complementing mechanisms to fully restore the loss of ExoN activity. Finally, MA-ExoN harvested from persistently infected SCID mice retained an attenuated phenotype when re-inoculated into mice, suggesting that persistence does not select for virulence. Future studies will address whether additional modifications could serve to enhance and stabilize the attenuated phenotype by reducing the likelihood of gain of function by homologous recombination, such as introduction of the ExoN inactivation in the TRS-rewired background38, which could increase resistance to reversion.",

(d) MA-ExoN (24-h passage 8 and 72-h passage 3) and MAwt (passage 1) infections of 12-month-old female BALB/c mice. Weight loss is shown. Error bars indicate standard deviations. (e) Infections of 10-week-old female BALB/c mice with MA-ExoN and MAwt population viruses isolated from 30-d SCID mice; weight loss is shown. Dashed line: Mock (PBS) inoculation; dark shapes, solid lines: MA-ExoN; white shapes, solid lines: MAwt. Circles: Mouse 1 populations; squares: Mouse 2 populations; triangles: Mouse 3 populations. (f) Weight loss in 11-month old female BALB/c mice infected with MA-ExoN 2.1 (with C16999A) and MA-ExoN 3.1 (without C16999A) plaque isolates from 30-d-infected SCID mice (SCID30) is shown. Squares: SCID30 MA-ExoN 2.1; Circles: SCID30 MA-ExoN 3.1. Error bars indicate standard deviations.",
