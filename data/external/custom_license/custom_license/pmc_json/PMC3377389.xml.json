Complete necropsy was performed on all animals shipped to the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden, during the study period. Samples of lung, kidney, and spleen were collected during necropsy and stored at \u201320\u00b0C until analysis. The main causes of death were traffic accidents and sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei infestation) (27). Infections with common feline viruses were rare (28), and seropositivity to Toxoplasma gondii was more common among lynx from central Sweden than from farther north, where the climate is more harsh and the human population less dense (29). A total of 263 lynx, sampled during 1995\u20131999, were included in the present study.",

Northern Sweden, apart from the mountain chain bordering Norway, is part of the circumpolar northern coniferous forest belt, the taiga. It is sparsely populated by humans; human populations increase toward the south and gradually decline farther from the coast. The southernmost part of Sweden belongs to the broad-leaf forest region of central Europe but is mainly cultivated. Lynx typically live in forested areas and are found throughout most of Scandinavia. They may come close to human settlements. Although their main prey are roe deer, they also prey on reindeer and sheep. Furthermore, debilitated lynx affected by sarcoptic mange and orphans searching for easily accessible food are often found around human settlements. Interactions between diseased lynx and domestic cats and dogs have been documented (30,31).",

Investigated lynx with exact age known were 0\u201313 years of age (mean 2.5 years \u00b1 2.6 SD).

Numbers of males and females were equal in the juvenile and adult age classes, but within subadults there were more males (n = 68) than females (n = 27). According to the time of death, animals were grouped into seasons relevant to the biology of the lynx: delivery (May\u2013July, n = 6); small kittens and lactation (August\u2013October; n = 7); large kittens hunting with the dam (November\u2013January, n = 24); and breeding season, separation of kittens from dam, and main hunting season (February\u2013April, n = 224).",

Fifteen \u03bcL of PCR product mixed with 3 \u03bcL 6X loading buffer (0.25% [wt/vol] bromphenol blue and 40% [wt/vol] sucrose) were loaded in each well. The gels were run in TAE buffer at 150 V for 1.5 h and examined by using a Gel Doc 2000 Documentation System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Oslo, Norway). Primers and dNTP were removed from amplicons by using ExoSapIT reagent (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), adding 1 \u00b5L/5\u00b5L PCR product, incubating 45 min at 37\u00baC, and by conducting enzyme inactivation for 20 min at 80\u00baC. Cycle sequencing was conducted in both directions by using Big Dye 3.1 reagents (ABI BigDye Terminator version 3.1, Applied Biosystems). Two microliters EDTA (125 mmol/L), 2 \u03bcL sodium acetate (3 mol/L), and 50 \u03bcL of ethanol were added to the 20 \u03bcL sequencing product. Electrophoresis of the cycle sequencing extension products was conducted in an ABI Prism 377 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Multiple sequence alignment was performed by using ClustalX 1.181 (32). The phylogenetic tree was generated with the neighbor-joining method by using MEGA 3.1 (www.megasoftware.net).

We cannot rule out the possibility that the OPV tk sequences obtained from lynx were derived from other OPVs apart from cowpox virus; but although the phylogeny is based on a partial sequence of a single gene, which may have restrictions as a predictor of phylogenetic relationships (35), we suggest that the tk OPV sequences obtained from the lynx in this study were probably derived from cowpox virus. This assumption is based on the fact that the lynx tk sequences were 100% identical with the partial tk gene of several cowpox virus isolates (Figure 2 and data not shown) and is also supported by the phylogenetic analysis, which showed that the lynx tk gene sequences formed a common clade with those of CPXV-GRI (strain GRI-90 isolated from a person infected by contact with a mole) (36) and of isolates from 1 person (No.H1) and 1 felid (No.F1) from Norway (Figure 3). Given the general genetic heterogeneity of cowpox virus isolates (35,37), it is not surprising that the clade containing the OPV tk sequences from lynx diverged from that of some other cowpox virus isolates, such as CPXV-BR and the 2 isolates from persons in Sweden (Swe.HI and Swe.H2; Figure 3).",

Lynx from areas with high human density, and thus a presumably larger domestic cat population, were more often infected than lynx from less populated areas, indicating a possible relationship between domestic cats and lynx. A similar association with human presence has already been observed with regard to seropositivity to T. gondii in some lynx in this study (29). In contrast, previous studies (1999) of other pathogens in some of the lynx (n = 70) included in this study suggested that contacts between lynx and domestic cats are uncommon; seroprevalence of antibodies against feline parvovirus was low; and feline leukemia virus antigen and antibodies against feline coronavirus, calicivirus, herpesvirus, and feline immunodeficiency virus were absent (28). Assuming that lynx are susceptible to these feline pathogens, this difference may be explained by the fact that domestic cats are commonly vaccinated against these viral infections but not against T. gondii and OPVs. Nevertheless, these results may suggest only limited contact between domestic cats and lynx, pointing at wild rodents and possibly shrews as the direct source of the OPV infection for lynx.",

The severe epidermal lesions and breakage of the skin barrier might predispose the animals to infection by OPVs, such as cowpox virus, and such viruses might contribute to the severity of sarcoptic mange in lynx. Alternatively, altered behavior in diseased lynx could influence exposure to infection. In contrast to healthy lynx, those with mange are commonly found in human settlements, where they sometimes prey on domestic animals, including cats and dogs (30).",

This study also provides further evidence that OPV, presumably cowpox virus, is widely distributed in ecosystems in Sweden. This finding may be relevant for vaccination strategies (39), especially when considering the use of OPVs as vectors in genetically recombinant vaccines and their ability to undergo spontaneous genetic recombinations with virus relatives when replicating in the same cells of a host. Moreover, our findings indicate that the role of OPVs, such as cowpox virus, as potential human pathogens may increase, considering their broad distribution in ecosystems, the cessation of smallpox vaccination of humans, and an increasing number of immunocompromised persons. Thus, targeted surveillance of rodent species, and the carnivores that prey on them, is necessary for monitoring the emergence or reemergence of these viruses as potential human pathogens. Further genetic studies are needed to determine whether the detected virus in the free-ranging lynx population in Scandinavia is indeed cowpox virus.",
