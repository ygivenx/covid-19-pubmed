The futuristic model of pediatrics is likely to be greatly modified by technology boom with further erosion of doctor-parent/patient relationship [2]. The day is not far off when a patient walks in the doctor\u2019s chamber with an electronic or digital health history on a CD or palmtop. He may be asked to walk through a screening device to decipher his genome and get baseline biochemical parameters. The child is likely to get a computer-based diagnosis with the help of apps-based algorithms and given a print out of the prescription.",

Identification and decoding of human genome is the greatest achievement of 21st century [3, 4]. Human genome project (1984\u20132003) has identified and sequenced 25,000 genes. Around 3 billion DNA base pairs have been decoded by DNA probes. The scientists have identified 1800 diseases, which are expressed through genes. On the basis of genome, we can plan personalized strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases with patient-specific or tailor-made drugs. Human genome has highlighted one of the mysteries that 90 % of human DNA carries no instructions. Nature can\u2019t be wasteful, it is unlikely to be \u201cjunk DNA\u201d, and it seems to be the storehouse of untapped human mysteries and potential.",

The source of stem cells may be autologous (stored patient\u2019s own blood) or allogeneic, when stem cells are obtained from a compatible donor. In allogeneic stem cell therapy, risk of infection, mismatching, rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is much higher. Cord blood is a rich source of stem cells. A number of companies such as Lifecell, Babycell, Cordlife, and Stemade provide services for collection and cryopreservation of cord blood, which can be used for treatment of a number of life- threatening and lifestyle diseases in the donor, siblings and parents in later life. It is possible to repair a defective organ of the body by infusing totipotent natural or cloned stem cells [11].",

The age old symbol of physicians, the stethoscope, is likely to be replaced by digital stethoscope powered by iPhone or Android smart phone, hand-held ultrasound device, pulse oximeter and apps -based algorithms for making a diagnosis in the ambulatory clinic. DNA and rRNA probes are likely to be increasingly used for diagnosis of infective and genetic disorders [12, 13]. It is envisaged that in due course of time, just a drop of blood will be enough to obtain values of most of the biochemical parameters. Electronic devices in the form of a smart biometric \u201cwrist watch\u201d are in the pipeline to monitor vital signs, some biochemical parameters, hydration status and oxygen concentration. It is based on non-invasive pulse wave data collector using a modified applanation tonometry technique for recording real -time radial artery pulse waves. It can be used as a stand-alone device or paired with your iPhone or Android smart phone [14, 15]. The work is in progress to develop sensors for assessing kidney functions and add-on displays for EKG and EEG. Intelligent scales or cutting-edge wireless smart scales are being developed to monitor body weight, body mass index (BMI), body water, bone mass, and daily caloric intake. Japan is in the forefront to develop smart loos or intelligent toilets to maintain effective bottom hygiene, assess certain body parameters and analyze body wastes.",

There is a popular Indian saying, \u201cWhen diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct, there is no need for any medicine\u201d.

The concept of functional foods is being increasingly exploited to prevent illness, promote health and improve quality of life. These foods have potentially positive effects on health beyond nutrition [17]. They promote positive health and reduce the risk of diseases by virtue of phytonutrients, antioxidants, soluble and insoluble fiber, and probiotics [18].",

Computer-aided surgical robots are being increasingly exploited to conduct routine and complex surgical procedures at a local site or a distant location. The robotic surgery is associated with advantages of smaller incision, greater precision, miniaturization, reduced blood loss, less pain and shorter duration of hospital stay. Intelligent surgical knife (iKnife) has been developed for bloodless incision and the vaporized smoke produced while cutting the tissues is analyzed by a mass spectrometer to diagnose malignancy real-time. A large number of electronically guided equipment like lasers, fiber optics, drills and staplers are being used to conduct surgical procedures more effectively and with greater safety. Smart e-pants or electric underpants are available to prevent occurrence of bedsores in chronic and comatose patients.",

There are seven chakras, which are located along the spine adjacent to various endocrine glands. They are linked with the body Meridians, Nadis, Bhongan, and Duct system. It is believed that life energy or Prana flows into and out of our chakras. Starting from base of the spine to the top of the head, the chakras include Kundalini (coccyx), Hara (sacral), Solar plexus (navel), Heart (midback), Thyroid (base of throat), Brow (third eye), and Crown (sahasrara), which integrates all the chakras and is a source of astral energy (gold sun) or global consciousness or nonbeing. A healthy person, who has physical vitality, mental clarity, emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing, is likely to have bigger and brighter auras [39, 40]. Whenever, there is stress or dysfunction, whether physical, psychological, social or spiritual, the chakra energy field or halo is disturbed. Human chakras can be scanned by various Kirlian equipment like Polycontrast Interference Photography (PIP), Digital Aura Scanning System (DAS), Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV), Medical Thermal Imaging (MTI), Resonant Field Imaging (RFI), and Electro Interstitial Scanning (EIS).
