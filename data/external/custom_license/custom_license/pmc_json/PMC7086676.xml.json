            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a major factor responsible for outpatient visits and hospitalizations of infants and young children, and they are also one of the leading causes of child and adult morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]. Respiratory viruses are predominant causes of ARIs, but acute respiratory infection etiology is complex and often remains unknown because an etiological determination is frequently not done for patients with respiratory symptoms, either in the clinic or in the laboratory [2]. Influenza-like illness (ILI), a subset of ARIs, can be attributed to a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza virus (IFV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43), and parainfluenza virus (PIV1-3) [3]. Improvement of techniques in molecular biology has resulted in the high-through detection of several respiratory viruses, including novel pathogens such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [4], human bocavirus (HBoV) [5], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [6], human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [7, 8], coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) [9\u201311], and rhinovirus (HRV), which are generally considered to cause mild upper respiratory illnesses [12, 13]. Patients infected by these diverse viral pathogens develop widely overlapping symptoms, which makes clinical diagnosis unreliable and is a severe limitation to etio-epidemiological investigation.",

Clinical symptoms of viral respiratory infections are too similar to distinguish between etiologic agents. Better identification of the broad spectrum of respiratory viruses for ILI is essential, and this has impelled public health officials to formulate more effective prevention and control strategies, including monitoring of influenza vaccine efficacy in communities [14]. The etiologic agents associated with ILI in developed countries have been well characterized, but less is known concerning the epidemiology and etiology of ILIs caused by agents other than influenza viruses, and only a small number of groups have reported the prevalence and clinical presentation of viral respiratory infections in China [15\u201317]. So far, molecular epidemiology of ILI has not been conducted in Huizhou. In order to fill this gap and to better understand the etiological pattern in Huizhou, the clinical characteristics, epidemiological patterns, and viral pathogens involved in ILI were investigated in a local population admitted to Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital with ILI during July 2011 and July 2013. The methods used in this study represent a significant improvement over conventional methods for the detection of a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses.",

Nevertheless, most of the data on the epidemiological features and etiological characteristics of influenza-like illness were from more-developed regions in the world, and less is known about the etiology of influenza-like illness in China, especially in cities. The accurate and rapid analysis of a broad range of viral agents is critical for etiological investigations. In the present study, a continuous surveillance of 14 respiratory viruses of patients with influenza-like illness was conducted in Huizhou, China, from July 2011 to July 2013.",

These differences could be due to environmental factors, population distribution, economic status, and the diagnostic techniques used. In addition, the sampling periods could also lead to differences in detection rates among studies. Hasman et al. [24] carried out a study during two successive winters in the USA and found 68 % samples from patients with influenza-like illness to be positive for at least one virus. In these studies, respiratory specimens were collected only during the winter. In contrast, our study was conducted continuously from July 2011 through July 2013, including not only epidemic but also non-epidemic seasons of influenza-like illness. Furthermore, infections from as yet unknown viruses may be responsible for ILI, and bacteria, such as M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, were not investigated in this study.",

A novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged and spread among humans in China during the spring of 2013. In order to find more patients without delay, ILI surveillance in national sentinel hospitals all over the mainland of China was strengthened. The possible reason for the peak in virus detection in April-July 2013 was that more samples were collected for etiological investigation. During the study period, H1N1pdm09 virus was the most prominent subtype in Huizhou, while the A/H1N1 subtype was not detected. It is possible that the epidemic of H1N1pdm09 interfered with the appearance of the A/H1N1 subtype. Of the total cases of ILI, 7.07 % were IFVB, which was the predominant viral pathogen and occurred mainly in cold winter. The incidence of influenza B was significantly higher among patients with ILI who were in the school-age group and the 15- to 24-year-old group.",
