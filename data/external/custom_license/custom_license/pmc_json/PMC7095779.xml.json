The outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 started in December 2019. On the 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared this event a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The reported cases and deaths of COVID-19 already exceed those of SARS or MERS. Here we highlight some of the key recent findings related to this global epidemic.",

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to other coronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, a clade of betacoronaviruses formed by the coronavirus that causes SARS (SARS-CoV) and other SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses found in bats3,4. Recombinations between coronaviruses are common, and SARS-CoV is believed to be a recombinant between bat sarbecorviruses. Interestingly, the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of a bat coronavirus detected in 2013 (>96% sequence identity)4, which suggests that the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in bats for at least several years.",

The first human cluster was reported in association with exposure to a seafood market2,5 that is known to sell live wild game animals for consumption. It is possible that the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might involve an intermediate host (or hosts), as was observed in the SARS epidemic. However, some of the earliest cases had no epidemiological exposure to this market5. It is therefore not yet clear whether the initial zoonotic jump occurred directly from bats to humans or whether an intermediate mammalian species was involved. Identification of the antecedent zoonotic source is relevant because further zoonotic transmission events may well occur unless the transmission pathways of the initial zoonotic event are identified and interrupted.",

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is predicted to be structurally similar to that of SARS-CoV3 and, indeed, it can be bound by a monoclonal antibody that is specific for the spike of SARS-CoV6. Although variations in key residues that are essential for binding to ACE-2 were found in the spike of SARS-CoV-2, this novel virus is experimentally capable of using human, swine, bat and civet ACE-2, but not mouse ACE-2, for entry4. The spike of SARS-CoV-2 can also theoretically interact with ACE-2 from other animal species7.",

The reproductive number (R0; the number of secondary cases expected in a completely susceptible population) and the epidemic doubling time were estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4\u20133.9) and 7.4 days (95% CI, 4.2\u201314), respectively. Studies from others also have led to broadly similar figures13. These are comparable to those observed during the SARS epidemic. However, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur from patients with mild disease9,10. Whether transmission can occur during the late incubation period remains controversial10. This is in sharp contrast to the transmission pattern observed during SARS, for which transmission rarely occurred until after the 4\u20135 days after symptom onset. Taken together, these findings suggest that the public-health interventions that successfully interrupted the spread of SARS-CoV are unlikely to be as effective in the current outbreak.",

With the current trends and assuming a reduction in transmissibility due to interventions, they predicted the outbreak in Wuhan will peak in April 2020. They also predicted that this epidemic will continue to grow exponentially outside Wuhan. Their simulations further suggested that a 50% reduction in the transmission of this disease achieved through public-health interventions, but without a reduction in population movement, can dramatically delay the exponential growth of this disease for at least a few months. While implementation of aggressive disease-control measures such as school closure and social distancing may defer the establishment of transmission in countries at risk of disease importation, it is still unclear if global spread of this disease can now be prevented.",

These include the modes of transmission, the stability of the virus in environments, mechanisms of pathogenesis and effective treatments and vaccines. In the current circumstances, the most important question is that of disease severity. It is relevant to note that in the early stage of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, case-fatality estimates as high as 10% were reported. However, population-based age-stratified sero-epidemiological studies revealed that the true overall case fatality was about 0.001% (ref. 14). Thus, sero-epidemiology is needed for a reliable estimate of true disease severity. Past infection may also translate into population immunity, which are data that need to be accounted for in future transmission models of the virus. It is relevant to note that infection with MERS-CoV or MERS disease does not always lead to detectable antibody responses15. If SARS-CoV-2 infection has antibody-response kinetics similar to those of MERS-CoV infection, this may have implications for sero-epidemiology and the development of herd immunity. Thus, research on both the antibody kinetics and cell-mediated immune-response kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 is a priority.",
