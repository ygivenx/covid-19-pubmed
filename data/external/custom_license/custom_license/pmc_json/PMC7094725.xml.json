The transgene expression with adenovirus vectors is usually robust and can be further enhanced by driving gene expression with strong heterologous promoters. The vector genome does not insert into the host chromosome, ensuring safe delivery. In addition, adenoviruses can be grown to very high titers in qualified cell lines.21, 22, 23, 24 These advantages make adenoviruses attractive vaccine vectors and they are being used widely in the development of vaccines against HIV, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), avian influenza, tuberculosis and anthrax.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 In a previous study, we constructed a replication-incompetent adenoviral vector containing a synthesized condon-optimized gene encoding the HC50 of BoNT type C (Ad/opt-BoNT/C-HC50) and evaluated its vaccine potential by intramuscular (i.m.) injection.31 In this study, we use the same adenovirus-based vaccine delivered by the intranasal (i.n.) mucosal route and show that long-lasting protective immunity occurs after a single dose.",

Given the ease of preparation and potential toxicity of all these neurotoxins, it is equally important to develop vaccines against all these toxins for biodefense. In this study, we evaluated the vaccination strategy against the BoNT/C and expect ultimately to apply the same platform to develop vaccines against all serotypes of BoNTs. Here, we have described a novel adenoviral vector delivery of a botulism vaccine against type C neurotoxin that when delivered as a single i.n. dose proved to be a highly effective vaccine. Owing to the single i.n. route of vaccination, this vaccine could be self-administered to protect the population in the event of terrorist attack with C. botulism or neurotoxins. In addition to the ease of administration and rapid onset of protection described here, the vaccine could be produced inexpensively, in high quantity and in a short time frame. We chose HC50 fragment of BoNT type C because the HC50 subunits of BoNTs are non-toxic and antigenic, and are capable of eliciting immunity responses against botulism.8, 10, 11, 12 Also in a previous study we showed that i.m. vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-HC50 elicited strong systemic immunity that lasted at least 27 weeks and mice receiving the vaccine were fully protected against BoNT/C challenge.31",

The latter delivery mode is the strongest bioterrorism-related threat.32, 33 The mucosal immune system is the first line of defense against botulism. However, the current injection-type botulism toxoid vaccine only provides protective immunity in the systemic compartment. Clearly, the development of a safe and effective mucosal vaccine should be a high priority against bioterrorism-related botulism.34 Previous research by Kobayashi et al.35 showed that nasal vaccination with BoNT/A toxoid plus a mutant of cholera toxin (E112K) effectively prevents mucosal BoNT intoxication in mice. Maddaloni et al.36 recently showed that mucosal vaccination with adenovirus type 2 fiber fused with HC50 of BoNT/A elicited robust mucosal antibody response, and addition of cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvunt in the vaccine further enhanced protective immunity in mice against challenge with active BoNT/A. These studies proved the feasibility for developing a nasal vaccine against botulism. Adenoviruses invade their host naturally through the mucosa surface, notably in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract.37 Adenoviral vector vaccines can be effectively delivered by i.n. mucosal route and can induce strong adaptive immune responses in mammalian hosts.21, 22 The replication-incompetent adenoviral vector Ad/opt-BoNT/C-HC50 studied here given as a protective, single i.n. vaccination elicited not only high serum antibody response to BoNTC/HC50 but also high specific antibody response in mucosal secretions.",

A mouse was injected i.p with the mixture of anti-serum and the BoNT/C corresponding 100 \u00d7 MLD50 of BoNT/C before neutralization, four mice for each dilution. The animals were monitored for 4 days, and the number of deaths at each sample dilution was recorded. The animal survived from 100 \u00d7 MLD50 of BoNT/C when the toxin was neutralized. Neutralizing antibody titers was defined as the maximum number of IU of antitoxin per ml of serum, resulting in 100% survival after challenge. One IU of type C antitoxin neutralizes 10 000 \u00d7 MLD50.11, 51",

Mouse sera were serially twofold diluted in EMEM containing 2% FBS after heat-inactivated at 55 \u00b0C for 45 min. A volume of 50 \u03bcl (104 p.f.u.) human WT Ad5 was prepared in EMEM containing 2% FBS and then combined with 50 \u03bcl of each diluted serum sample before an 1-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C. The virus\u2013serum mixture was subsequently added to AD293 cells and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. After the incubation, the virus\u2013serum medium was replaced with 200 \u03bcl of EMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C until the negative wells (without antiserum) exhibited 90% cytopathic effect. The anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the reciprocal of maximum antiserum dilution that allowed >90% of cells to remain viable relative to the control.",
