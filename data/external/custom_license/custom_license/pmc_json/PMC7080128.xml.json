Five of the centers assured interhospital transportation throughout the Italian territory whenever the nearest ECMOnet center could not cope with a case.A 24 h national ECMOnet Call Center Service sorted all requests from any hospital in Italy and directed them to the closest ECMOnet center, and/or to the transportation ECMO team on call.Ten sessions of a 3 day ECMO training course, open to physicians, perfusionists, and nurses of the ECMOnet were organized in Milan.\n",

The high survival rate observed in our study and in other studies on ECMO in severe H1N1 ARDS patients echoes the recently published findings of a recent trial comparing MV with ECMO (CESAR) [15] and strongly supports the use of ECMO as an effective means to improve outcome in the most severe H1N1 ARDS patients. However, as most of these studies are descriptive, randomized trials comparing ECMO to conventional treatment are needed.",

In the ANZ ECMO report, hemorrhagic complications were the cause of death in 10 of the 14 patients who died. In our study most patients died of multiorgan failure or septic shock, and in only one patient could death be related to a possible direct ECMO complication (cerebral hemorrhage). This result is comparable to that of the CESAR trial in which only one patient died because of an ECMO-related hemorrhagic complication [15]. Notably, in our study the need for ECMO was anticipated (following the ANZ ECMO experience) and planned as part of the critical response plan. Preventing and managing ECMO complications by promoting support from more experienced centers was a primary aim of the network.",

All our patients transported on ECMO were successfully transferred to the ECMO centers with no reported complications. Survival rate in these patients was 81%, supporting the effectiveness of ECMO in providing safe transportation of patients with severe respiratory failure. In the CESAR trial 22 of the 90 patients initially allocated to the ECMO group did not receive ECMO because they improved with conventional treatment once at the ECMO center [15]. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the patients transported with ECMO might not have needed ECMO if treated from the beginning with other rescue therapies at the referral centers, where more therapeutic options were available. However, most of these patients were considered to be not safely transportable without ECMO.",
