Some national health authorities currently release patients from isolation once their symptoms disappear. But Kathryn Holmes, who studies coronaviruses at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, pointed out that cats infected with a coronavirus can continue to shed the virus for up to seven months after symptoms clear up (A. A. Herrewegh et al. Virology\n234, 349\u2013363; 1997).",

Several studies have shown that experimental vaccines against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), for example, can aggravate the infection through a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement. Antibodies produced in response to vaccination with FIPV proteins bind to the virus and boost its uptake by immune cells called macrophages. Other viruses are destroyed when engulfed by macrophages, but in this case the FIPV multiplies inside the cells.",

Pharmaceutical-industry representatives at the meeting reiterated that the hope of a quick drug or vaccine for SARS is slim. A new antiviral drug would take a minimum of four to five years to reach the shelf, they said, a vaccine closer to six.",
