Several factors, either singly or in combination, may cause neonatal diarrhoea including environmental, managemental, nutritional, and infectious. Enteric infections may be caused by protozoa, bacteria and/or viruses. In calves, the viruses most commonly associated with neonatal diarrhoea are the group A rotavirus and coronavirus; it is not unusual for both viruses to concomitantly infect calves. Mixed infections might also occur between viruses and bacteria and/or protozoan (Alfieri et al. 2006; Oliveira Filho et al. 2007).",

The frequency of infection shows notable variation between different geographical regions, the production type (dairy or beef) of the evaluated herds, and diagnostic techniques. The highest rate of BCoV infection was reported in calves from Brazil (39%) and Ethiopia (38.9%) using HA/HI and ELISA assays, respectively (Abraham et al. 1992; Jerez et al. 2002). In other countries from America, Asia and Europe, the frequency ranged from 4 to 15.6%, based mostly on the results of PCR assays (Reynolds et al. 1986; Snodgrass et al. 1986; De La Fuente et al. 1998; Khalili et al. 2006; Park et al. 2007). In Brazil, only a few studies have evaluated the BCoV occurrence in stool samples from calves (Jerez et al. 2002; Takiuchi et al. 2006; Oliveira Filho et al. 2007). The rates of infection measured ranges from 16 to 39%; however, the occurrence of BCoV infection has not been well characterised, since the number of evaluated faecal samples examined was relatively low in all these studies. Furthermore, the stool samples were collected from only one region and the animal management conditions were also different, making it difficult to establish a comparison and to draw conclusions about the overall BCoV infection frequency among Brazilian cattle herds.",

A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for BCoV detection in calf faecal samples reportedly shows high sensitivity and specificity when compared to other techniques (Cho et al. 2001). Additionally, a semi-nested (SN) PCR assay was recently developed to detect the N gene of BCoV in fresh or frozen faecal samples from naturally infected calves (Takiuchi et al. 2006).",

Since the HA test was performed directly on faecal specimens, the non-specific hemagglutinins present in the faeces may cause false-positive results justifying this higher rate of BCoV infection (Sato et al. 1977). Moreover, in this previous study, only dairy herds (n = 16) were included, which does not necessarily reflect the overall rate of BCoV infection among Brazilian cattle herds. Another study performed only on faecal samples from calves with diarrhoea also presented a higher infection rate (24%) than that reported in this study. Since the previous study used the SN-PCR assay with the same primers and conditions, the higher reported frequency may be justified by the low sampling used that did not necessarily reflect the actual infection rate of BCoV among calves from Brazilian herds (Takiuchi et al. 2006).",

The present study shows similar results, since 16 to 30-day-old calves showed a significantly higher (p = 0.0023) frequency of infection when compared to the other age groups evaluated. Similar results were also described, with a higher rate of viral shedding, in 15 to 18-day-old calves (Jerez et al. 2002). The association between calf age and BCoV infection was probably due to the decreasing levels of antibodies acquired from the colostrum. The frequency of infection among diarrhoeic calves in the other age groups was very similar (Table 2), but higher than that found in the control group (asymptomatic calves), which showed a BCoV infection rate of 3.3%. This result shows that calves of up to 60 days of age, when infected with BCoV, frequently develop the clinical symptoms, even with some passive immunity in the first week of life or natural resistance that acquires significant levels at 30 days of age.",

The rate of BCoV infection in diarrhoeic calves herein presented (19.0%) was similar. Surprisingly, when comparing only results from stool samples taken from calves of up to 30 days of age from both studies, the BCoV frequency rate of infection was slightly higher than the rate of group A rotavirus infection determined by the previous study (28.3 and 26%, respectively). In this way, the BCoV infection must also be considered an important neonatal enteric disease since it was present at a similar frequency as rotaviruses and caused diarrhoea in most of the cases. The four Brazilian states included in this study were also evaluated in the rotavirus study, which makes the comparison more accurate.",
