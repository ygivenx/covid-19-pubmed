In the initial absence of effective vaccination, measures such as quarantine, travel restrictions, and the promotion of individual protection behaviors such as frequent hand washing, wearing of face masks, or avoiding public gatherings were the measures of choice during the SARS outbreak and will be again should another pandemic influenza, caused, for instance, by H5N1, occur. The effectiveness of such control measures depends fundamentally on the public\u2019s willingness to cooperate, which again is likely to be associated with the level of personal risk people perceive. Sound empirical data about the ways lay persons perceive such risks are therefore essential to develop health communication strategies and successfully devise containment plans. Collecting such a sound database, however, requires first a thorough theoretical understanding of what constitutes lay persons\u2019 risk perceptions of pandemic influenza, how these perceptions emerge, as well as how they influence protective behaviors.",

Psychological research on risk perception has mainly been dominated by the psychometric paradigm on the one hand and the subjective expected utility approach on the other [2]. The psychometric paradigm [3, 4], wanting to investigate what characterizes risk in the public\u2019s view, has tried to map lay people\u2019s perception of different types of hazards in factorial space, describing the decisive dimensions as unknown risk and dread risk, with the latter dimension being the most important determinant of a \u201crisk image.\u201d While unknown risk describes phenomena which are perceived of as new, nonobservable, unknown to science, and whose effects are delayed, dread risk has been defined by characteristics such as involuntariness, uncontrollability, fatal consequences, and catastrophic dimensions. Technological hazards, such as nuclear power or genetically modified food, tend to be perceived of as unknown risks and, just like natural disasters, often convey high dread potential. Lifestyle behaviors like smoking, unhealthy eating habits, or car speeding, on the other hand, are usually thought of as observable and well known and thus rank relatively low on the factor unknown risk. Also, lay persons tend to perceive these behaviors as voluntary, controllable, and as affecting people one at a time rather than simultaneously endangering whole populations. So, in the public\u2019s eye lifestyle factors lack the dread potential of technological risks and hence often seem more acceptable than the former.",

            "text": "While there is yet no empirical evidence for this, one might speculate that the specific characteristics of disease threats such as SARS or avian influenza would place them conceptually closer to technological risks or to natural disasters than to individual risk behaviors. Just as for technological risks, an initial lack of knowledge about the origin or the life course of a newly emerging virus and the fact that the infection process in itself is unobservable and that visible effects are delayed might produce high rankings on the factor unknown risk. In addition, pandemic influenza, just like technological and natural hazards, has catastrophic potential, as infection could be fatal, and large numbers of people would be affected at the same time within the same geographical region. Beyond this, global mobility is bound to further add to catastrophic impact by rapid spread of a respiratory virus to distant regions of the world. Also, as specific vaccines need time to be developed and as 100% effective medication is unlikely to be available for a considerable time span, these diseases are difficult to control - all aspects which suggest that pandemic influenza would rank high on the dread risk factor just like technological risks or natural disasters. On the other hand, it is particularly the issue of control which might make perceptions of pandemic influenza more ambiguous. Like in the case of natural disasters or technological hazards, there is an outside threat, in this case a virus, which might seem difficult to control. However - different from natural or technological hazards - this particular outside agent depends on everyday human behavior to spread, i.e., social contact and hygiene behaviors. Even more than for instance smoking, car speeding, or alcohol consumption, these behaviors are extremely common, well known, and observable, more or less voluntary and\u2014at least theoretically\u2014modifiable or controllable. Objects with these characteristics are rarely perceived as \u201chigh risk\u201d by lay persons, as research based on the psychometric paradigm has demonstrated [4]. Thus, at least during the initial phase of an outbreak, there might be a difference between perceived threat of the disease and the risk potential actually attributed to one\u2019s own individual contact behaviors.",

If proven valid, however, this phenomenon might have consequences for planning public health control strategies. To combat disease spread in the initial phases of a pandemic influenza outbreak, where no vaccine is available, control measures will have to rely on influencing the extent (e.g., avoiding public gatherings, closing down schools and work places) and mode (e.g., wearing of face masks, no handshaking, frequent hand washing with soap, etc.) of human contact behaviors. Thus, within a very short time span, social interaction would have to transform from an integral, essential, mostly beneficial, or at least unquestioned part of daily life into risk-fraught, even potentially lethal behavior. How prepared or reluctant people are to make that mental shift, how effective risk perceptions are in initiating protective behaviors without creating panic and problematic social exclusion processes, and which factors influence these processes are key questions for planning containment and communication strategies.",

Based on the subjective expected utility (SEU) approach [2], which posited that people\u2019s choices are a product of assessments of probability and utility/desirability of options, health-related approaches such as the Health Belief Model (HBM) [5, 6] or Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) [7, 8] have defined risk in line with the technical understanding of risk, i.e., as the likelihood of contracting a disease multiplied by disease severity. Together with other types of expectancies, like outcome expectancies (or cost\u2013benefit perceptions) and self-efficacy expectations, these perceptions of risk are then presumed to determine health-protective behaviors such as using health care services, refraining from smoking, or being physically active. These models have found widespread application as well as a considerable degree of empirical support (see below) and might therefore also provide a sound basis for answering questions on how far pandemic influenza risk perceptions can be relied upon as motivating factors for protective behaviors. Beyond a mere focus on risk perception, they can also help reveal how other types of cognition, such as outcome expectancies, about control measures as well as judgements on costs involved in such measures, such as cutting or reducing human contacts, might support or counteract the motivational processes initiated by risk perception.",

            "text": "The Health Belief Model and Protection Motivation Theory, however, also have shortcomings which could limit their use for studying pandemic influenza risk perception. One common criticism of these models pertains to their strong focus on conscious-rationalist situational appraisal which falls short of capturing the emotional processes involved in human decision making. Dual-process models have for a long time been suggesting that analytic-central and emotional-heuristic processes work in concert to select and prioritize decisions and behavioral reactions [9, 10], and under certain circumstances emotions may even be the dominant force. Damasio [11] has thus suggested that automated incentive or alarm signals linked to pleasant or unpleasant \u201cgut feelings\u201d often precede cognitive reasoning. In a similar vein, processing theories have emphasized the importance of an emotion\u2013cognition pathway [12\u201314]. Based on these ideas, the \u201crisk as feelings\u201d or \u201crisk as values\u201d approach [15\u201317], just as the notion of an \u201caffect heuristic\u201d [18, 19], have posited that when making judgements individuals draw on two processes of evaluation, which reside in two distinct, if interrelated, systems of decision making. These are an analytic-rational system based on logical reasoning and probability judgements, on the one hand, and an experiential system, on the other, where direct automatic visceral reactions influence decision making, based on images, metaphors, and related emotions.",

This framework might well apply for behaviors aimed at fending off long-term chronic disease such as screening participation or lifestyle behaviors. In such cases, fear is likely to be less imminent and therefore secondary to more rational reflections about gains and losses related to protective behavior. However, in an acute threat situation like an influenza pandemic, emotional aspects might gain more immediate importance. This is all the more likely if, during the early stages of an outbreak, experts are unable to make more than tentative statements and provide partly contradictory prognoses and recommendations as it happened with SARS. Under these circumstances cognitive risk assessments might be severely hampered by lack of evidence-based information. Consequently, individuals might have little choice but to rely on experiential judgement. However, what role exactly an affect- or emotion-based judgement plays in interaction with risk-related cognitions is still an issue in need of clarification.",

Health behavior models such as the HBM or PMT have mainly focused on how risk perceptions and other cognitions influence behavior, while the question of how risk perceptions are formed in the first place has met with little attention. Public risk perception is thus mostly conceived of as an aggregate of purely individual assessments - a perspective which neglects cultural and subcultural frames of reference [22]. Slovic [4], in contrast, has emphasized the importance of worldviews, which can be perceived of as sociocultural attitudes guiding individual risk perception by providing normative orientation. Similarly, social representation theory [23] or the social amplification of risk framework [24, 25] have emphasized the importance of collective, (sub)cultural\u2013social dynamics which shape individual ways to perceive of and react to risk.",

While such processes can be assumed to be relevant for all societies, it seems probable that such \u201csocial risk perceptions\u201d are even stronger in the collectivist societies of Asia than in the more individualist cultures of the West. Factoring in such processes of perceiving and reacting to collective threat is unquestionably an essential element of pandemic influenza preparedness.",

A threat like pandemic influenza, where in the initial absence of a vaccine the efficacy of countermeasures must remain unclear, might be particularly prone to such no-action responses. Vice versa, some people will downplay risk as a kind of coping strategy and thus report lower risk perception which, however, would not necessarily keep them from initiating protective action. Testing such alternative pathways requires the investigation not only of cognitive but also of emotional aspects of or reactions to risk perception.",

In the absence of positive outcome expectancies for protective behaviors or high self-efficacy, in terms of feeling able to perform these behaviors, high risk perceptions are unlikely to be particularly effective. Another important factor in this context is perceived social norms as outlined by the Theory of Reasoned Action/Theory of Planned Behavior [28, 29]. Normative influences can explain why even those with low personal risk perceptions sometimes adopt protective behaviors. During an outbreak protective behaviors are widely recommended and visibly performed by a great number of people, so that their practice acquires normative status. During the SARS epidemic this might have happened with behaviors such as wearing of face masks, frequent hand washing, or avoidance of public gatherings, where the issue was not only to protect oneself but also to not be perceived as someone who puts others at risk.",

Not accounting for anticipated or intended positive behavior change can lead to an underestimation of risk because it is likely that some people assess their risk as being low due to already factoring in a change towards anticipated or already accomplished protective behavior. The authors, however, also pointed out that the relevance of this issue depends on whether the precaution is actually expected to eliminate or at least reduce the risk (response efficacy). For investigating pandemic influenza, this type of validity threat might therefore be less imminent than, e.g., for a study on the relationship between perceived risk of \u201cnormal\u201d influenza and getting a vaccination. Even so, such effects are unlikely to be nonexistent, so that perceived pandemic influenza risk research should also profit from assessments with and without (anticipated or actual) behavior change.",

In cross-sectional studies perceptions of risk for \u201cordinary influenza\u201d in people who have already been vaccinated are bound to be affected by their expectation of being protected by the vaccination, hence their lowered risk perceptions - which then should not be interpreted as an indication of higher risk perception leading to less protective behavior. Brewer et al. [26] explicitly tried to disentangle the various types of effects by investigating different temporal hypotheses of risk perception about Lyme disease and protective behavior, i.e., getting vaccinated. Based on their findings, they once more emphasized the well-known predicament of cross-sectional studies. Even though often claiming to test a behavior motivation hypothesis, studies based on correlational designs cannot perform more than a test of an accuracy hypothesis, stating that people who engage in more risk behaviors should also endorse higher risk perceptions. Testing a behavior motivation hypothesis on the other hand requires a longitudinal design, looking at whether higher risk perception at t1 leads to a stronger increase in protective behavior at t2. Yet another effect is suggested by the risk appraisal hypothesis, which suggests that risk appraisal will change as a result of behavior change, i.e., it will decrease once positive behavior change has been initiated. The two tests should thus generate inverse correlations. In the first phase, when the behavior motivation model is tested, perceived risk should be positively related to preventive behavior. In the second phase, however, when the risk appraisal model is under investigation, a negative relationship between preventive behavior and risk perception should be expected. Empirical findings of the Brewer et al. [26] study supported these assumptions, showing that higher initial risk judgements concerning Lyme disease encouraged people in favor of vaccination. Taking action subsequently reduced risk perception, indicating also that people who had been vaccinated viewed their risk as lower than those who had not, thereby confirming the accuracy hypothesis. The quite common failure to explicitly distinguish these processes contributes to misinterpretation of findings and misattribution of effects.",

This multifaceted picture was further complicated by the fact that many studies, besides explicitly introducing measures of risk perception, additionally assessed aspects which could be considered as risk-related and/or which actually were considered integral parts of risk perception by some other studies. While, for example, some authors included fatality ratings in their core concepts of risk, others presented these as independent aspects.

Thus, only three of the quantitative studies (11%) gave an account of the empirical relationship between measures of cognitive risk assessment and fear/anxiety [44\u201346], with, for instance, one study reporting a correlation of r = 0.64 for their measures of perceived risk and worry about contracting SARS [44]. No study provided an extended discussion about the ways in which these aspects might relate to and influence each other.",

Personal risk perception and network risk perception, on the other hand, are estimations of one\u2019s own and close others\u2019 very specific probability to contract SARS or avian influenza or to die from this disease as, for instance, specified in the HBM or PMT. Forty-six percent (N = 12) of the 26 quantitative studies focused on the personal perspective alone, i.e., assessed the risk for the self without tapping universal risk in their core concepts, while 27% (N = 7) measured solely universal or community sense of risk, and another 27% (N = 7) looked at both aspects. Assessment of network risk was less common and occurred exclusively in combination with either of the other two measures.

In particular, these ratings pertained, for instance, to the probability of contracting SARS in different places within a city, such as public places, offices, or public transport [56], when traveling on board of a plane [51], when interacting with recovered patients [41], or risk from specific behaviors such as buying live chickens [43].

Of these, only two (17%) explicitly based their risk concepts on a theoretical model, i.e., the PMT [40] and Weinstein\u2019s [58] Optimistic Bias concept [42]. This low percentage of model-based research increased to 50% (N = 8) in the subgroup of studies which investigated the potential role of risk perceptions as determinants of health-related behaviors or behavioral intentions (N = 16). Of the seven quantitative studies which were model-based, three used the HBM [41, 48, 51]; two further studies [38, 39] named the HBM as well as the Theory of Reasoned Action/Theory of Planned Behavior [28, 29] and Bandura\u2019s Self Efficacy Theory [59] as the basis of their work. Another choice presented by one of the studies [44] was the Precaution Adoption Model [60], and one further study [53] based its research on a state-dependent expected utility framework [61, 62]. In addition, the HBM and PMT were claimed by one of the qualitative studies, which explored the association between risk perception and compliance with quarantine [32]. In three of the quantitative studies all or most of the variables introduced by the respective model were tested within a multivariate analysis [39, 48, 51], while the other studies used major components of the theories and/or tested bivariate relationships between separate model components and protective behaviors. Only one of the model-based studies had a longitudinal design [63].",

The purpose was thus socioepidemiological in most cases, aimed at assessing psychological reactions towards the SARS or avian influenza threat in general populations or in specific subgroups, such as health care workers, to predict adoption of protective behaviors and thereby to provide data for future intervention planning. This predominantly practice-oriented intent might explain the pervasive lack of conceptual elaboration on the perceived risk concept that was encountered. In fact, only few studies explicitly defined or theoretically explained their notion of perceived risk. Instead, it was mainly the operational level, i.e., the measurement instruments, which provided indications about the underlying notions of risk perception.",

The variance which occurred on all these dimensions clearly indicated that behind the common claim to investigate \u201crisk perception\u201d there was only very limited agreement on what exactly constitutes such perception of risk and how it should be measured.

While it seems plausible that a pandemic influenza outbreak constitutes a highly uncertain, ambiguous, and threatening situation, where lay people tend to fall back on immediate, visceral, and emotionally loaded concepts and images rather than rational probability assessments, this notion needs empirical testing: at different points in time, before and during an outbreak, and with different subgroups within general populations. However, only a little more than half of the reviewed studies looked not only at cognitive risk assessment but also at SARS- or avian-influenza-related emotions. Only about one third of the quantitative studies explicitly perceived of this emotion-based judgement as a dimension of risk perception and not as some external aspect. And whatever the concept - \u201crisk as feelings\u201d or \u201crisk and feelings\u201d [19, 64] - neither of the studies provided further theoretical elaboration on why fear or worry were perceived of as part of risk perception or seen as separate features, just as there was little interest in the empirical relations between cognitive and emotional aspects of risk perception. At this point, empirical research on SARS and avian influenza risk perception can thus provide few insights into the issue of whether emotions result from cognitive risk assessment and/or precede such cognitions or how cognitive and emotional processes interact in creating notions about \u201crisk\u201d and influence behavior. While the mostly social\u2013epidemiologically oriented studies which formed the basis for the current review were not designed and intended to investigate such issues, future research should be directed towards this area as findings would not only be relevant for theory development but also for the ways in which health risk messages will have to be framed and designed in case of future outbreaks.",

First, quite a number of studies did not use a differentiated concept of risk at all but simply asked respondents to rate their risk to contract SARS. While this type of assessment, particularly when related to terms like \u201ccontracting\u201d or \u201cgetting\u201d a disease, can be considered predominantly cognitive and conceptually close to the \u201clikelihood of contracting\u2013measure,\u201d there is also plausibility in the assumption that the term risk inherently entails severity aspects and/or is likely to incur more negative emotional connotations than the more neutral likelihood and is therefore conceptually closer to \u201cfear.\u201d This is also supported by psychometric paradigm-related research, suggesting that lay people tend to judge events with low probability but high catastrophic potential such as nuclear accidents as \u201chigh (dread) risk\u201d [3, 4].",

However, a substantial number of studies included measures of fatality and it might be argued that fatality ratings are in fact assessments of value (i.e., severity) rather than measures of expectancy. Indeed, in many studies which used fatality measures, these were explicitly introduced as measures of severity of disease. Such a claim certainly has some degree of content validity, since most people would consider diseases they believe to be potentially fatal also as serious, even if from a purely structural\u2013systematic perspective, probability of death ratings clearly refer to an expectancy-, not to a value-element. However, even when these ratings were counted as measuring severity, it seemed that severity was not generally considered to be an integral part of the risk concept, but was more often presented as a separate entity. This was also emphasized by the fact that only one study actually used the multiplicative term specified by the HBM and PMT [40], i.e., the product of probability and severity. All these deviations from standard definitions of risk occurred mostly without any explanation of the rationale behind them \u2014 even in cases where models such as the HBM or PMT had been referred to in the theory sections of the papers. Testing the effects of subcomponents and their possible interactions, however, might yield essential information for effective risk communication, for instance, in terms of being able to specifically target unrealistically low perceptions of occurrence likelihood versus underestimations of severity.",

[26, 27] have pointed out and which also became apparent in the present review. The most common assessment related to the self (personal risk), but some studies also measured risk perceptions for close others (network risk) and/or for the society/community as a whole (universal or societal/community risk). While network risk was commonly measured in addition to personal risk, societal/community risk was most often assessed instead of personal risk. While for respiratory infections risk of self and risk of others - due to \u201csocial contagiousness\u201d - are bound to be correlated, they are also liable to differ. Judgements on personal likelihood to contract infectious disease are subject to considerations of individual immune competence and host resistance. Since diseases such as SARS and avian influenza are still relatively new and unknown in the wider population, people are likely to refer to personal experiences with diseases which might seem to bear some resemblance to \u201cnormal\u201d flu or other infectious diseases. Based on differing individual experiences with susceptibility or immune competence, there could be considerable divergence between personal ratings and those for the population in general. In addition, tendencies towards an optimistic bias [58] should influence personal ratings to be generally lower than those for the overall population. Harris and Middleton [67], who investigated risk perceptions for various health hazards in students, showed a gradient for most of the rated conditions depending on who the rating was made for: from lowest ratings for the self to slightly higher ones for very close others, even higher ones for acquaintances, to highest scores for unknown others. Even if such tendencies should be less pronounced for respiratory infections such as SARS, which - compared to lifestyle disorders - tend to be \u201cequal-opportunity diseases,\u201d subjective concepts about individual susceptibility or resistance capacity might produce quite different results depending on who the risk is assessed for. In any case, if the goal is to determine how risk perception influences protective behaviors, personal risk assessment should be the first choice, while the other perspectives - while also important - should provide additional rather than surrogate insights.",

            "text": "Surprisingly few studies extended their view from the health dimension of SARS or avian influenza risk to other types of risks. Thus, only three studies asked their respondents to also rate other disease risks or to make direct comparisons between risk of SARS and other risks [37, 44, 53]. Such comparisons could provide important insights, as the motivational potential of risk perceptions in case of an outbreak depends not only on their absolute but also their relative strength when compared to other health concerns. Relative importance of pandemic influenza risk, however, also relates to other types of risk which might be involved in a pandemic influenza hazard such as, for instance, social risks. Especially studies looking at health care workers did assess not only personal health risks but also the perceived risk of spreading the disease to family and friends and/or issues of stigmatization and social isolation [32\u201334, 37, 54, 55]. While in the reviewed studies stigmatization and social isolation were mostly assessed in terms of actual experience, it is plausible to assume that anticipations of such processes (\u201csocial risk cognitions\u201d) are relevant for shaping the sum of pandemic influenza risk connotations and thereby influences behavioral responses. Above and beyond risk to one\u2019s personal health, anticipations of being responsible for spreading the virus to loved ones or being socially excluded because of one\u2019s job might detract considerably from readiness to accept risk and might interfere with professional behavior in health care workers. This issue was also explicitly reflected in the concept of risk acceptance, which was brought up by a few studies [33\u201336, 37, 54, 55]. How professional groups who have a key role within containment plans balance personal and social risk expectations with their professional roles, how they weigh the risk of getting infected and in turn infecting others against the risk of jeopardizing their professional identity, is a concern which needs to be faced and dealt with in the course of effective intervention planning. Otherwise, a sudden lack of readiness of professionals will disrupt care for those who have already become patients or get in the way of public health containment measures and endanger collective protective action.",

They investigated determinants of risk perception within Chinese communities in the Netherlands and the UK, pointing out the role of social costs of infection due to anticipated stigmatization processes. Similarly, a recent qualitative study on Hong Kong SARS survivors [68] showed that stigmatization and discrimination was a pervasive and traumatic experience, a finding which led the author to conclude that anticipations of such social exclusion processes might well endanger the effectiveness of public health measures should there be another major outbreak (see also [69]). Particularly in the early stages of an outbreak, when people are perhaps anyway more ready to interpret ambiguous respiratory symptoms as indications of \u201cnormal\u201d flu than of a life-threatening disease, they might thus deliberate and delay, hoping that the symptoms will turn out harmless and go away, rather than take the risk of being prematurely identified as a carrier of a potentially lethal virus. Social risk perceptions such as these could easily cancel out motivating effects of perceived disease risk. Thus, the so far most commonly used one-dimensional notion of SARS/avian influenza risk as a \u201cmere\u201d health hazard might fall short of grasping the whole of what makes up lay persons\u2019 or health professionals\u2019 ideas about pandemic influenza risk.",

In one of the original contributions to the current issue, Voeten et al. reported lower avian influenza risk perceptions in a sample of Chinese residents in the UK and the Netherlands in comparison to the general populations in these countries. According to the authors, an explanation for this rather surprising finding might be found in studies such as the one by Lai and Tao [70] who showed that Chinese people in general seem to be far less concerned about disease risks than about risks that threaten, for instance, national stability and economic development. In the same vein, two of the reviewed studies [40, 42] reported lower risk perceptions in Asian as compared to European or North American samples. While this variation may largely be due to social\u2013cultural differences, socioeconomical considerations may also play a part. Thus, people living under economically precarious conditions may place a relatively lower value on health consequences, at least as long as these remain speculative and distant when compared to other more immediate economic daily hazards. This might be specifically relevant for groups such as poultry workers who in case of an avian influenza outbreak will find themselves between a rock and a hard place when evaluating health vs. economic risk. Vice versa, as an example from the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum, globally mobile executives might at some point have to face the \u201cbads\u201d of globalized risk society as the almost inevitable flip side of the \u201cgoods\u201d [71, 72], having to weigh the risk of health damage against that of economic losses due to restricting travel. Future research will have to take up the challenge to understand the processes by which pandemic influenza risk is grounded in the (sub)cultures and social structures of different countries and their respective worldviews [4] in order to effectively tailor communication strategies to specific groups, particularly those who might face a heightened risk of exposure to influenza viruses while at the same time facing economic or social risks, like for example poultry farmers and vendors in the case of H5N1.",

Particularly, behavior-specific risk ratings should be expected to relate more closely to particular protective behaviors than general risk perception. In an outbreak situation specific assessments can help identify \u201ccritical areas of risk perception\u201d where people perceive unrealistically low or high risk and which might warrant intervention. Vice versa, general risk expectations provide an interpretational background for behavior-specific risk perceptions because, even when specific risks are perceived of as not particularly high, this does not necessarily imply that risk perception in general is also low and vice versa.

The latter should yield higher risk perceptions than those without qualification, as in the former case the disease has yet to arrive and might seem not only geographically but also psychologically more removed. In general, hypothetical risk perceptions such as these are hard to compare to \u201creal\u201d risk perceptions under outbreak conditions and do not refer to exactly the same phenomenon. Unlike chronic diseases, which develop gradually, pandemic influenza tends to be a more binary or \u201con\u2013off phenomenon\u201d, which sets quite distinct frames for risk perception under conditions of outbreak versus no outbreak. It would be profitable to study how hypothetical risk perceptions in a non-outbreak situation develop under conditions of imminent threat and whether perceptions of hypothetical risk can be extrapolated to actual risk perception.

Exposure occurs prior to actual contraction or acquisition. Health care workers in an outbreak area might perceive a considerably higher likelihood of exposure to pandemic influenza than of actually contracting the disease because they might hope that immune competence and control measures would protect them from actually being infected.

Just as there was little theoretical elaboration on the risk concept itself, only a minority of the subgroup of studies which investigated the possible predictive role of risk perception for protective behaviors could actually be considered model-based. The current review showed that, of the 16 studies which were dealing with this issue, only half referred to any theoretical concept or model, most often the HBM.

To obtain a comprehensive picture of how decisions about protective behaviors are made, risk perceptions need to be tested in comparison to and/or in concert with other cognitions, such as those specified by the HBM or PMT, i.e., perceived efficacy of countermeasures (outcome expectancies) or the costs and benefits associated with behavioral change. For instance, the social aspects of pandemic influenza risk discussed above could also be conceptualized in terms of costs associated with risk-related behavior, as specified by the HBM. Thus, as outlined above, the cost factor \u201canticipated stigmatization\u201d (or \u201csocial risk perceptions\u201d) might neutralize mobilizing effects of health-related risk perceptions, for instance by precluding disclosure of symptoms. Also, to answer the question \u201chow high is high enough\u201d with regard to risk perception and \u201chow high is too high\u201d because helplessness sets in, risk cognitions would have to be jointly investigated with their emotional connotations and also together with outcome expectancies about control measures as well as self-efficacy expectancies. Taking action is bound to depend not only on motivating factors such as risk perception but also on enabling features like perceived availability of effective behavioral options or perceived social norms. Also, the construct of risk acceptance introduced by a few studies might further contribute to successfully predicting protective behaviors. Even high health risk perceptions in terms of likelihood to contract an infection might fail to have mobilizing effects if the related social risks are given greater weight, so that the health risk, even if high, is tolerated. Thus, a more systematic application of multifactor models would allow for far more complex insights into the workings of risk perceptions in shaping behavior than the most often used tests of bivariate relationships alone.",

Despite their claim to investigate the motivating effects of risk perception on health-protective behaviors (behavior motivation model), the overwhelming majority of the studies which looked at risk perception\u2013protective behavior relationships actually investigated risk perception\u2013behavior accuracy models [26]. That is, due to the dominating correlational study designs, positive relations between risk perception and behaviors, like hand washing, wearing of face masks, or being careful in handling live chickens, indicate little more than the fit between perceptions of own protective behavior and risk (accuracy hypothesis), as people who protect themselves are also more likely to perceive less personal risk because of these protective behaviors. This ambiguity was exacerbated by the fact that no study attempted to compare behavior-conditioned and behavior-unconditioned risk perceptions, i.e., looked at risk perceptions with or without anticipated or past behavior change, as suggested by Brewer et al. [26, 27]. Not taking this precaution can lead to dilution of risk perception effects, as some respondents might already factor in behaviour change when estimating their personal risk.",

The investigation of this type of hazard might make studies less susceptible to internal validity threats than either studies on chronic disease or on types of acute disease which can be offset by vaccination, as in the Lyme disease example used by Brewer et al. [26]. Unlike the individual long-term development of chronic disease (e.g., coronary heart disease), where there is an extended time-frame for behavior-change, an outbreak situation creates a massive, collective, and acute threat, i.e., it has \u201cdread potential\u201d in terms of the psychometric paradigm, and people tend to feel more out of control [3, 4]. It seems likely that in the first stage of an outbreak risk perception is strongly influenced by the nature of the hazard and the way it is communicated by media coverage of case and fatality incidents. That impact might be more overwhelming than any effect which countermeasures might have on risk perception. In fact, the few longitudinal or cohort studies in this review found that during the initial phases of the SARS outbreak in 2003 there was a steady increase in risk perception, which only leveled off in later phases [45, 56]. Moreover, unlike other types of infectious diseases, which can be neutralized by almost 100% effective vaccinations, in case of pandemic influenza people cannot be certain about the effectiveness of preliminary vaccines or behavioral containment measures, so that it is unlikely that even strict adherence to protective behaviors will nullify any notion of risk. However, while these characteristics of pandemic influenza risk might lessen interpretational ambiguities, it will not eliminate them, particularly when studies are conducted in the latter phases of an outbreak. As consistent behavior change is more likely to have occurred by then, it is also more likely that behavior motivation effects are wiped out or reduced by appraisal effects (lower risk perceptions due to higher protective behaviors). Studying the change of pandemic influenza risk perceptions and their \u201ctrue\u201d influence on protective behaviors over time therefore remains an important objective, requiring not only studies with longitudinal designs, starting after potential future outbreaks, but also long-term surveillance studies which are initiated before an actual outbreak occurs.",

Also, in general, the descriptions of measurement instruments in the reviewed articles were not always sufficiently precise to permit completely clear-cut categorization.

This might, for instance, have happened in cases where authors explicitly labeled their ratings on probability of infection as their measures of risk perception but then also measured severity aspects without further comment on whether this was conceived of as a part of risk perception or not. As most studies provided no theoretical definition or elaboration on how risk perception was conceptualized, it cannot be ruled out that in some cases the apparent distinction in measurement was not a deliberate attempt at conceptual differentiation. Likewise, in some instances where studies were published in rather brief formats, it cannot be excluded that the empirical work actually was theory-based, but, due to extremely short background sections in some articles, this might not have been discernible.",

However, in order to gather more systematic and compelling data, which can be compared and evaluated within the context of others studies, and in order to build a sound evidence base, future studies in the field positively need to carry out more theoretical groundwork which can guide the development and choice of risk perception concepts and measurements as well as study designs. It was one of the most surprising findings of this review that the risk perception label was often used with little explicit explanation of what it stood for, as if risk perception were a self-evident and homogeneous concept. However, closer scrutiny of the studies revealed that this common label actually covered quite different notions \u2014 a, which would make it extremely difficult to draw any generalized conclusions from the resulting body of data. In view of this finding, it might be worth striving for a working consensus on indispensable core measures of risk perception, particularly for future surveillance and monitoring studies. As stated above, many of the studies were initiated in an ad hoc fashion as an acute response to outbreaks of SARS and human H5N1 cases and not as an explicit attempt at testing theory. However, the call for model-based risk perception research [15, 74] does not exclusively aim at benefiting theoretical knowledge about what \u201cis\u201d and what determines risk perception. A thorough understanding of how perceptions of risk develop and in what way and by which mechanisms they influence behavior is an indispensable prerequisite for the development of effective health risk messages and for promoting protective behaviors in case of an outbreak. To define the purpose of a study as predominantly pragmatic in terms of wanting to provide data for planning does not imply nonnecessity for theoretical groundwork. Otherwise, the data gathered might be difficult to interpret and of limited value, not at least for the practical purpose they were intended for in the first place.",

            "text": "\u201cThe threat of an influenza pandemic is, at present, one of the most significant public health issues our nation and world faces\u201d - so a statement of the US Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Andrew von Eschenbach in a press release from April 2007 [75]. While some medical advances have been made, thus for instance a preliminary vaccine has been developed to counteract human-to-human transmission of H5N1, there is still agreement that an initial outbreak cannot be controlled by medical strategies alone. Apart from the fact that the vaccine offers only limited protection, concerns have also been voiced that the medication which has predominantly been stockpiled so far, i.e., Tamiflu (oseltamivir), might be meeting with increasing resistance [76\u201378]. Also, it is by no means certain that the next epidemic actually will be a H5N1 outbreak, or if another new virus will emerge on the scene. Thus, traditional public health containment strategies will still be a centerpiece of preparedness planning. To provide a more profound basis for this type of planning and to enable effective health communication, research on pandemic influenza risk perception will have to progress from its current preliminary ad hoc stage into a more systematic, methodological, and theory-based endeavor.",
