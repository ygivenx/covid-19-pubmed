            "text": "IBV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, with a genome approximate 27.6 kb in length. In the genome, two-thirds of the 5\u2032 region encodes two polyproteins, polyprotein 1a (pp 1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp 1ab), in which pp 1ab is an extension of pp 1a by a minus 1 frameshift translation mechanism [1]. These two polyproteins are post-translationally processed into fifteen non-structural proteins (nsp 2\u201316, IBV does not have nsp 1 that is found in some other coronaviruses). The processing of pp 1a/1ab is performed by two virus-encoded proteases: papain-like protease (PLpro) contained in the nsp 3 and main protease (Mpro) contained in the nsp 5 [2]. Then these fifteen mature non-structural proteins take part in the process of viral RNA replication and other aspects of viral pathogenesis. Recently, some researches in reverse genetics had found that these nsps may play vital roles in pathogenesis [3, 4]. The remaining one-third of IBV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), and four accessory proteins: 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b. The S glycoprotein has been demonstrated to be the determinant of cell tropism [5], and the S1 subunit of S glycoprotein can induce neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies [6, 7]. The M and E proteins are two membrane-binding proteins. The N protein has the activity to bind viral RNA forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP). All these four structural proteins together with the viral RNA constitute the enveloped virion. The four accessory proteins have been demonstrated to be dispensable for virus replication; their actual functions are still undefined [8, 9].",

Point mutations, insertions, deletions, and recombination are of common occurrence in the IBV genome, which are responsible for the emergence of new IBV strains [10\u201314]. In this present study, a novel virulent strain was isolated and designated as SAIBK2 (abbreviation of Sichuan Avian Infectious Bronchitis Kidney 2). To investigate the origin of SAIBK2 and the reason for its increased virulence, the complete genome was sequenced and the complete sequence analyses were performed. The results revealed that SAIBK2 originated from multiple recombination events among a YN-, a YX10-, and a Mass-like strains and these recombination events may account for its increased virulence.",

Of the 53 disease chickens, 12 were infected by a novel virulence IBV strain which was designated as SAIBK2. 12 tissue samples of swollen kidneys from diseased chickens, infected with SAIBK2, were prepared as 10 % w/v tissue suspensions in 0.1 % phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then the tissue suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 1500 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, and filtered by 0.22-\u03bcm membrane filters. The supernatant was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs. The embryos were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and examined twice daily for their viability. The allantoic fluid was collected at 72 h post-inoculation and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.",

The third group is constituted of two Africa strains and one Europe strain. The fourth group was formed by two China strains and one Taiwan strain. Isolate SAIBK2 was clustered into group V, which was exclusively formed by China strains. This result revealed that SAIBK2 belongs to the most predominant genotype in China (Fig. 2). \n",

The results indicated that SAIBK2 may be a mosaic formed by a YX10-, a YN-, and a Mass-like strain (Fig. 3). To find out the regions where the template switches (breakpoint) have taken place, pairwise comparison between the complete genomic sequences of SAIBK2, YX10, YN, and Mass41_2006 was performed, and six breakpoints were found as shown in Fig. 4. The first recombination breakpoint is located in the nsp 3 (5874-5887 nt), the second is located in the nsp 4 (8103-8116), the third and fourth breakpoints are located in nsp 16 (19843-19868 and 20326-20345 nt, respectively), the fifth breakpoint is located in the non-coding region between ORF4 and ORF5 (25321-25328 nt), the last is located in N gene (26225-26247 nt). These results revealed that the YX10-like strain is the major parent of SAIBK2 and the first two recombinant regions (5888-8102 and 19869-20325 nt) are from the YN-like strain, the third region (25329-26224 nt) is from the Mass-like strain. To further verify these three above-mentioned recombinant events, the sequence identity (Table 4) and phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3b) among corresponding regions of SAIBK2, YN, YX10, and three Mass-like strains were performed. The results showed that SAIBK2 has higher similarity with YX10 than YN and Mass-like viruses in the regions of 1-5873, 8111-19842, 20346-25320, and 26248-27713 nt. In contrast, SAIBK2 is more similar to YN than YX10 and Mass-type strains in the regions of 5888-8102 and 19869-20325 nt, and is more similar to Mass-like strains in the region of 25329-26224 nt (Table 4). In line with the results obtained from the Simplot analysis and identity analysis (Table 4), phylogenetic trees constructed using the corresponding gene fragments also showed the same results (Fig. 3).\n\n\n",

            "text": "In coronaviruses, including IBV, recombinant events efficiently happen and it has been well documented to be responsible for the emergence of new variants [11, 14\u201316]. To investigate whether recombination events took place during the evolution of SAIBK2. SimPlot analyses were conducted and three recombination events were illustrated in the results (Fig. 3a). The study of sequence identities (Table 4) and phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3b) based on corresponding regions both further confirmed the results of SimPlot analyses. As the results of sequence identity and SimPlot analyses exhibited, YX10 is the major parent of SAIBK2. YX10 was isolated in Zhejiang province, China in 2010, and caused 25 % mortality in SPF chicken [17, 31]. Compared with YX10, mortality in SPF chicken caused by SAIBK2 was higher (50 %). Considering the recombination events that happened in the procedure of formation of SAIBK2 genome, it is with reason to speculate that the acquisition of the regions from the YN- and Mass-like strains should account for the increased virulence of SAIBK2 compared with YX10. YN was isolated in Yunnan province, China in 2005. It can result in 65 % mortality in SPF chickens [18]. According to the result of SimPlot analyses, SAIBK2 genomic regions of 5888-8102 and 19869-20325 nt were from YN-like strain, and these two regions encode several highly hydrophobic stretches and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTase), respectively [19\u201323]. Meanwhile, Mass-based live attenuated IBV vaccines, including H120, are used extensively in China, and SAIBK2 genomic region of 25329-26224 nt was from Mass-like strain; this region contains Gene 5 and N-terminal domain of N protein. All the three regions above-mentioned involved in recombination events have been documented to act important roles in virus replication [24\u201330]. Nevertheless, IBV pathogenicity is regulated by multiple genes; these above-mentioned recombination events, together with mutations in the SAIBK2 genome, altered the replication efficiency and resulted in the increased virulence, as observed. However, further investigations by reverse genetic system should provide more profound insight into this issue and increase the understanding of IBV pathogenesis.",
