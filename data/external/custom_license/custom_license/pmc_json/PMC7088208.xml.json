Four OAS genes, mapped to chromosome 12, have been described in humans: OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL (OAS-like) [2\u20135]. OAS enzymes are involved in the antiviral effect of IFN via the OAS/RNaseL pathway. Following exposure to novel viruses, IFN-I is one of the first cytokines released from immune-competent cells. IFN-I subsequently initiates an innate antiviral response via the induction of numerous IFN-stimulated genes. Among these are the OAS genes, which encode the synthesis of oligoadenylates of general structure ppp(A2\u2032p9)nA (2\u20325\u2032A); 2\u20325\u2032A requires double-stranded (ds) RNA structures, such as viral genomes, to become activated. The activated enzyme then catalyzes the polymerization of ATP into 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2\u20325\u2032A). These, in turn, bind to and activate latent RNaseL, which degrades viral genetic material and inhibits protein synthesis [4\u20136].",

The SNP at rs2660 corresponds to the amino acid substitution, Arg397Gly. Although these two SNPs are in complete linkage disequilibrium (|D, |= 1.000, r\n2 = 1.000), rs10774671 may be a more functional SNP because it is positioned at the last nucleotide of intron 5 in OAS1 and serves as a splice-acceptor site for exon 7. The A allele is predicted to abrogate splicing at this site. Splicing occurs further downstream, resulting in two mRNA forms, designated p48 and p52, which are associated with lower OAS enzymatic activity. The G allele at this site is predicted to allow splicing, giving rise to a p46 form with high enzymatic OAS activity. Heterozygotes exhibit intermediate OAS activity [10, 12, 13]. The p46 form more efficiently synthesizes 2\u20325\u2032A, degrades viral genetic material, and inhibits protein synthesis. Hence, individuals carrying the G allele and GG + GA at this locus are less likely to become infected with chronic HCV.",

Individuals with AA or AG genotypes or with the A allele at this locus were associated with an increased risk for chronic HCV infection. These data support a relationship between SNPs at rs3741981 and HCV susceptibility, with the AA and AG genotypes and the A allele being risk factors for chronic HCV infection. This is explained by the corresponding amino acid substitution at rs3741981. The OAS1 protein belongs to the dsDNA-binding protein family, which is characterized by one or more dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBM) and by enzyme activation following binding between dsRBM and dsRNA [8, 19]. Substitutions of nearly any of the amino acids within the consensus dsRBM decreased dsRNA binding [20\u201322]. The A/G polymorphism in exon 3 of rs3741981 corresponds to the Ser162Gly substitution, which is located near the dsRNA-binding domain (amino acids 104\u2013158) of OAS1. This decreases dsRNA binding and viral nucleic acid degradation. This may explain the observation that different individuals with different alleles exhibit different susceptibilities to chronic HCV infection.",

However, the detection of OAS1 gene SNPs using HRM-PCR has not been reported previously. We detected OAS1 gene SNPs in all samples we analyzed.
