Although Rhabdoviridae family members are widely distributed in nature where they infect vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants, those in the Vesiculovirus genus are restricted to biting insects (mosquitoes, sand flies, blackflies, and ticks) and mammals. There are at least 14 phylogenetically and serologically distinct members in the Vesiculovirus genus [108] that separate into two broad groups based on geographic distribution; those found in the Americas, including the Indiana (IND) and New Jersey (NJ) serotypes of VSV, and those found in the eastern hemisphere (India, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East), including Isfahan, Chandipura, and Yug Bogdanovac.",

Signs of disease include vesicular lesions around the mouth, nostrils, teats, and coronary bands of the hooves. Although the disease often leads to weight loss due to impaired feeding, symptoms usually resolve in 10\u201314 days without consequence. VSV infection of livestock is accompanied by a very transient, low-level viremia and the disease is not readily transmitted from animal-to-animal even in a confined setting [45, 104]. Therefore, while livestock may display overt signs of disease, they are likely dead-end hosts without a major role in virus spread. In contrast, there is circumstantial evidence that biting insects are a major virus reservoir and vectors of disease in animals. Many vesiculoviruses have been recovered in nature from blood-sucking insects [17, 102, 107, 109] and bite transmission of VSV IND and Chandipura to laboratory animals by experimentally infected mosquitoes and sandflies has been demonstrated [6, 46, 80, 103, 105, 109]. In addition, natural infection has occurred in sentinel animals exposed in areas of known virus activity [47, 104]. The hypothesis that insects are the major VSV reservoir is further supported by the demonstration of vertical transmission in experimentally infected sand flies that, in nature, would allow virus to propagate and persist in insect populations without the need of an intermediate host [103, 106, 110].",

The virus genome is an \u223c11-kilobase single strand of negative-sense RNA encoding five major viral proteins (Fig. 1). The N protein is the most abundant virus protein expressed in infected cells and associates closely with genomic RNA to form viral nucleocapsid, which is the functional template for both viral transcription and replication [115]. The P and L proteins associate to form the functional viral RNA polymerase that performs both transcriptase and replicase functions [21, 74, 113]. The M protein is the most abundant protein in the virus particle and has multiple functions in the infected cell, including virus budding, inhibition of host cell gene expression [2, 8, 41, 54], and regulation of viral transcription [13, 15]. The G protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that forms trimeric spike-like structures on the virus surface [40, 55, 83, 118], and facilitates virus attachment to host cell receptors and uptake by endocytosis. At pH <6 the G protein undergoes a conformational change resulting in the fusion of viral envelope with the membrane of endosomal vesicles [30], releasing viral nucleocapsid and viral RNA polymerase into the host cell cytoplasm to initiate the replicative cycle.\n\n",

During this process the transcriptase complex occasionally detaches from the nucleocapsid template at intergenic junctions and must return to the 3\u2032 promoter to reinitiate transcription, which results in a pronounced 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 gradient of VmRNA expression (Fig. 2). This transcription gradient allows the virus to express individual proteins at optimal levels for viral replication. For example, the L gene encoding the viral RNA polymerase, which is a catalytic protein needed in relatively small amounts, is distal to the 3\u2032 transcription promoter and is transcribed with low efficiency in infected cells. Conversely, the N gene encoding a major structural protein, which is required in abundance for nucleocapsid formation, is immediately adjacent to the 3\u2032 transcription promoter and is efficiently transcribed [112].\n\n",

The mechanism responsible for switching RNA polymerase from a transcription to a replication mode is not fully understood, although a number of hypotheses have been proposed [3, 9, 10, 16, 73]. The nucleocapsid is also the functional template for genome replication as it is for transcription. The viral replicase initiates RNA synthesis at the exact genome 3\u2032-end and proceeds to the 5\u2032-end, ignoring transcription stop and start signals to produce a full-length positive sense copy of the viral genome. Nascent positive- and negative-sense genomic RNA is encapsidated with N protein in a cooperative, coreplicational manner [10, 59], and the resulting ribonucleprotein complex subsequently functions as a template for further genome amplification and mRNA transcription. The increased availability of amplified viral genome templates for secondary transcription leads to a rapid increase in the abundance of all viral proteins needed for mature virus particle production.",

However, as a result of pioneering work carried out in a number of laboratories, a recovery process known as \u201cvirus rescue,\u201d was developed approximately 10 years ago [57, 95, 116]. The rescue procedure involves the transfection of susceptible cells with plasmids expressing the virus N, P, and L proteins and a full-length positive sense genomic RNA (Fig. 3). The N, P, and L proteins associate with the nascent genomic RNA to initiate virus replication and transcription, producing infectious virus progeny. The ability to rescue VSV from cloned cDNA has allowed fundamental questions on virus replication to be addressed, and has also enabled the rational design and development of recombinant VSV (rVSV) as a vaccine vector [27, 34, 35, 84, 85, 88, 89, 114].\n\n",

The virus genome is simply organized into discreet transcriptional units (TUs) for expression of viral proteins, and nucleotide signal sequences involved in the control of viral gene expression have been defined [96]. Accordingly, one or more additional TUs encoding foreign proteins can be added to the VSV genome and robustly expressed under control of the 3\u2032 transcription promoter [82, 84, 85, 89]. Furthermore, the abundance of foreign protein expression can be modulated depending on proximity of the extra TUs relative to the 3\u2032 transcription promoter (unpublished data) [72]. Although the mutation frequency of VSV is high [18, 37] and additional foreign genes are not essential for virus replication, the consensus sequence of foreign protein open reading frames (ORFs) can be maintained over many rounds of amplification [96], ensuring preservation of target antigens during the vaccine manufacturing process. The ability of rVSV vaccine vectors to propagate vigorously in qualified continuous cell lines also facilitates industrial scale manufacture of vaccine preparations.",

Indeed, the existence of many different vesiculovirus serotypes may be exploited to design multiple rVSV vaccine vectors [88] for prevention and treatment of many different diseases. VSV does not cause any obvious signs of disease after parenteral administration to either livestock or nonhuman primates (NHPs) [89], and rVSV vectors are anticipated to be innocuous in humans when administered parenterally. Other desirable safety features include the lack of a DNA intermediate during viral replication and the cytoplasmic site of genome replication, both of which reduce the likelihood of viral nucleic acid integration into host cell DNA. Furthermore, vector genome stability is enhanced because it is encapsidated and cannot undergo recombination.",

            "text": "In the prototypic rVSV vectors, foreign genes were expressed from a TU inserted at position 5 in the viral genome (Fig. 4) between the G and L genes [49, 84, 85, 89]. This insertion site was chosen to minimally perturb the stoichiometry of viral protein expression, which is modulated by distance of each gene from the 3\u2032 transcription promoter. Because the L protein has a catalytic function, displacing the L gene by one additional TU from the 3\u2032 promoter was viewed as a conservative genome alteration that should not adversely affect viral replication, while allowing adequate foreign protein expression to generate an immune response. This rationale was supported by in vitro growth studies showing only minimal reduction in peak virus titers for vectors containing an extra foreign gene between the G and L genes [22, 85]. Furthermore, the level of foreign protein expression was sufficient to elicit robust antigen-specific immune responses after a single inoculation of mice and rabbits [82, 84, 85]. In some cases, primary immune responses could be further boosted with a second dose of homologous vaccine 1 to 2 months later [82, 85]. However, because durable neutralizing antibodies are usually elicited against the VSV surface glycoprotein after a single vaccination with replication-competent rVSV vectors, glycoprotein exchange vectors were designed to allow more effective boosting of immune responses to target antigens. The exchange vectors were generated by switching the IND serotype G gene in priming vectors with either the VSV NJ or Chandipura serotype G gene in boosting vectors [88].\n\n",

In these pioneering studies, rhesus macaques were immunized with a combination of two prototypic rVSV vectors expressing a HIV-189.6 Env gp160/VSV-G fusion polypeptide and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag p55 protein. Vaccine vector administration by a combination of intramuscular and intranasal routes clearly demonstrated the ability of rVSV vectors to elicit potent antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses in NHPs. In addition, this study also clearly demonstrated for the first time the ability of rVSV vectors expressing Env and Gag proteins to provide highly significant protection from AIDS after an intravenous heterologous SIV/HIV (SHIV)89.6P challenge [89]. In this study, all seven macaques receiving rVSV expressing HIVenv and SIVgag remained disease-free after SHIV89.6P challenge for >4 years ([89] and J. Rose, personal communication). By comparison, all eight control macaques [either unimmunized or immunized with lab-adapted rVSV expressing influenza hemagglutinin (HA)] progressed to AIDS with an average time of 8 months ([89] and J. Rose, personal communication). The protection from AIDS in this study correlated with large differences in peak viral loads, low or undetectable viral loads at set point, and with the preservation of CD4+ T cells in the vaccinees relative to controls. This encouraging level of post-challenge vaccine efficacy suggested that rVSV vectors expressing HIV genes might be an effective AIDS vaccine in humans.",

Most notably, rVSV-based vaccine vectors, at least in animal models, can be safely and effectively administered via a mucosal route as shown in several animal models. For example, a single intranasal inoculation with an rVSV vector expressing the influenza virus HA protein in mice [84, 85], the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 glycoprotein D in mice [69], or a measles virus HA protein in cotton rats [94] completely protected animals against mucosal challenge with the corresponding wild-type pathogen. Recently, our laboratory systematically compared the immunogenicity of rVSV vaccine vectors when given either as an intramuscular or intranasal inoculation in an effort to determine which route of vaccine administration was optimal for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses in rhesus macaques [19]. Our results demonstrated that Mamu-A*01+ MHC class I-positive macaques, vaccinated with a combination of rVSV vectors expressing HIV-189.6Penv or SIVgag by the intranasal route, developed significantly higher HIVgag and HIVenv peptide-specific cellular immune responses as determined by MHC class I tetramer staining, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT), and cytotoxic T cell assays. It is interesting to note that systemic and mucosal humoral immune responses did not vary significantly with the route of vaccine administration.",

Although the rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors described above are attenuated relative to VSV field isolates, they are replication-competent and subject to the same stringent safety testing used for other live attenuated vaccine viruses. For this reason, the prototypic rVSV vector and a number of closely related rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag protein were tested in an exploratory NHP NV study. This study was also warranted by historical data showing that VSV field isolates and tissue culture-adapted VSV strains were neurotrophic and neurovirulent in rodents [81, 92, 111], and that VSV serially passaged in mouse brain was found to be neurovirulent in livestock and NHPs inoculated by the intracranial route [29, 70].",

The step-wise translocation of the N gene further away from the 3\u2032 transcription promoter leads to incremental reduction in N protein expression, thereby limiting nucleocapsid formation (Figs. 2 and 5). Because nucleocapsid is the functional template for mRNA transcription and genome replication and is part of the virion core, limiting nucleocapsid leads to a decrease in viral protein synthesis, genome amplification, and formation of mature virus particles. In addition to providing a means of attenuating rVSV vectors incrementally, another attractive feature of this attenuation strategy is the known genetic stability of N gene translocations [4, 27], which greatly eliminates the likelihood of reversion.\n\n",

However, when the CT was truncated to either one or nine amino acids (CT1 and CT9, respectively) (Fig. 6), peak virus titers obtained in cell culture were reduced, and the resulting viruses were less pathogenic in mice after intranasal inoculation [85, 98]. The attenuation mechanism likely involves an impaired interaction between the viral ribonucleoprotein core and the truncated G protein CTs during viral morphogenesis [66, 71, 98], leading to a reduction in the efficiency of virus particle assembly. As seen for N gene translocation, G protein CT truncation also gives rise to virus with a very stable attenuation phenotype because replacement of deleted sequence encoding part of a protein is very improbable.\n\n",

Because the temperature of nasal epithelium is typically lower than core body temperature, selective incorporation of ts mutations should produce rVSV vectors that replicate vigorously at 32\u201335\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C, and serve as vectors for intranasal vaccination (Fig. 7b).

Another related vector has most of the G protein ectodomain deleted (G stem), retaining the CT region, transmembrane domain, and 42 amino acids of the membrane proximal ectodomain (Fig. 8). This vector is also propagation-defective, requiring G protein in trans for production of infectious particles in vitro. Expression of the truncated form of G protein (G stem) enhances the overall yield of progeny virus particles in vitro compared to vectors with the entire G gene deleted, perhaps due to increased concentration of G protein CTs at the cell plasma membrane, facilitating virus assembly and budding [86]. Although propagation-defective virus offers obvious safety advantages, difficulties in providing adequate quantities of complementing G protein to allow efficient vector amplification during industrial scale manufacture are a possible limitation.\n\n",

Therefore, additional strategies to further attenuate rVSV vectors are being explored, including combinations of CT truncations with either N gene rearrangements or Mncp mutations (Fig. 9). It was thought that these mutation combinations would increase vector attenuation beyond levels obtained using single attenuation strategies. Other types of gene rearrangement, including M and G gene shuffling, singly and in combination, are also under investigation [5, 25]. Specific combinations of ts mutations are also being developed in an effort to ensure tight shut-off of viral replication at the nonpermissive temperature while retaining high levels of transcriptional activity (Fig. 9).\n\n",

A ferret NV model was recently developed because components of the influenza virus particle can induce significant neuropathology in NHPs after intracranial inoculation in the absence of viral replication (unpublished data). Because the ferret NV model might be a better indicator of NV and neurotropism potential in NHPs and humans, rVSV vector safety also will be assessed after intranasal and intracranial inoculation of ferrets.

Therefore, rVSV vectors that produce only minimal to mild inflammatory responses in the brain would be strongly favored over those causing necrotic lesions. If, as expected, some of the further attenuated rVSV vectors currently under development cause only very minimal inflammatory responses in the NHP CNS after intrathalamic inoculation and retain HIV-1-specific immunogenicity, then one or more of these vectors will be considered for future clinical evaluation.",

The prototype rVSV vectors developed by Rose et al. [89] positioned the gene expressing the foreign antigen toward the 5\u2032-end of the viral genome. This was done to promote efficient rescue from cDNA and maintain viral replicative fitness. However, due to the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 transcription gradient, positioning the foreign gene toward the 5\u2032-end of the genome reduces the expression of the foreign antigen, relative to the four VSV 3\u2032 proximal gene products. Therefore, future rVSV vectors will be designed with the foreign antigen gene at the 3\u2032-end of the VSV genome (position 1), thereby maximizing the expression of the foreign antigen. Positioning the foreign gene in the first position in the genome should also have an attenuating effect on virus growth as all viral genes will be translocated further away from the 3\u2032 transcription promoter, reducing their expression.",

In addition, the primary immune response to the vector often limits the effectiveness of subsequent booster immunizations. In both small animal models and NHPs, a strong serotype-specific neutralizing antibody response is generated against the G protein of VSV after a single inoculation. The presence of these neutralizing antibodies precludes using the identical rVSV vector as a boosting vector in animals and will presumably have the same effect after vaccination in humans. To circumvent neutralizing antibodies and create vectors for boosting, Rose et al. [88] developed rVSV glycoprotein exchange vectors that encode the N, P, M, and L genes of the VSV IND serotype, but have the gene expressing the VSV IND serotype G protein substituted with either the gene expressing the VSV NJ serotype G protein or the gene for the G protein of the related Vesiculovirus Chandipura virus [88]. While these glycoprotein exchange vectors circumvent the neutralizing antibody response to the G protein, it is possible that T cell responses to the N, P, M, and L proteins might restrict virus replication and limit the ability of these vectors to boost responses. Generation of a complete rVSV NJ serotype vector was not attempted due to the potential for cross-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses between IND and NJ VSV serotypes. However, there are additional viruses in the Vesiculovirus genus that could be used to supply G genes for future rVSV G protein exchange vectors if multiple boosting vectors are desired. Attachment glycoprotein exchange of this manner does introduce a new gene into the vector, may alter the vector phenotype, and therefore careful safety testing must be conducted before advancing these vectors to clinical trials.",

Studies in mice conducted with vectors expressing HIV Env or Gag showed that boosting rVSV-primed animals with vaccinia-based vectors produced a fivefold increase in peak HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses relative to mice boosted with rVSV glycoprotein exchange vectors [35]. As a follow up study, Ramsburg et al. [78] compared the effectiveness of a single prime-boost immunization regimen in macaques consisting of lab-adapted G protein exchange VSV vectors expressing SHIV env, gag, and pol proteins to that of a protocol consisting of a lab-adapted rVSV vector prime followed by a single boost with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the same SHIV proteins. The macaques primed with a rVSV vectors expressing SHIV proteins and boosted once with a MVA vector expressing SHIV proteins mounted increased immune responses relative to animals boosted with VSV exchange vectors; however, due to the small numbers of macaques in each group, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Nevertheless, after intravenous SHIV89.6P challenge, MVA-boosted macaques demonstrated a further 1 log10 reduction in peak viral loads, cleared challenge virus faster, and preserved CD4+-T cell counts to a greater extent than macaques receiving VSV G protein exchange vectors. Collectively, these data suggest that while G protein exchange rVSV vectors can circumvent VSV-specific neutralizing antibody and boost vaccine-specific immune responses, vaccine-specific immunogenicity and efficacy are substantially improved by boosting with a heterologous viral vector.",

In the effort to use rVSV as a vaccine vector for human diseases, many groups have either replaced the VSV G protein or coexpressed it with glycoproteins from targeted human pathogens including hantavirus [58], HIV [43], influenza virus [56, 84], HCV [11], respiratory syncytial virus [49, 50], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [31, 51], Marburg virus [32, 44], Ebola virus [32, 44], and Lassa virus [32, 33]. When tested in animal models, these vectors elicited immune responses directed against the expressed foreign glycoproteins. More recently, NHPs immunized with rVSV vectors expressing glycoproteins from either Marburg or Ebola viruses were protected from disease after challenge with these pathogens [44]. Moreover, it is likely that replacing the VSV G protein with filoviruses glycoproteins altered rVSV vector tissue tropism such that they could readily target dendritic cells, as filoviruses are known to do. Such retargeted rVSV vectors could be designed to express additional foreign antigens from unrelated pathogens and serve as either priming or boosting vectors along with rVSV IND and NJ serotype vectors. Because retargeting by glycoprotein exchange can markedly alter virus phenotype and cell tropism, any new rVSV vector of this type will require extensive safety studies before clinical assessment.",

Furthermore, the ribonucleoprotein complex of VSV was shown to activate cellular kinases TBK1 and IKK\u025b that are involved in the production of type I IFNs [101].

IL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine expressed by antigen-presenting cells as a heterodimer, and drives the development of Th1-like responses. The ORF for an IL-12 fusion protein was inserted into a replication-restricted rVSV vector lacking the gene for the G protein (VSV\u0394G-IL12F) [52]. When VSV\u0394G-IL12F was coadministered with a weakly antigenic listerial antigen, enhanced Th1-polarized T cell responses (determined by listerial-specific IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion) and B cell responses (determined by listeria-specific IgG titers) were generated in mice.

VSV is naturally found in insects and livestock, is not considered a human pathogen, and has a very low seroprevalence in human populations. The small, simply organized viral genome can be altered to stably express one or more foreign proteins, and the resulting viral vectors can be amplified to high a titer in approved cell lines. The virus has a very broad host range and rVSV vector serotype can be changed simply by switching the surface glycoprotein with that from other vesiculovirus serotypes. VSV replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells, does not persist in vivo, and viral nucleic acid does not integrate into host genomic DNA.

Therefore, to investigate the potential neurotropism and NV of prototypic rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors, exploratory NV testing in NHPs was carried out. The results of these tests indicated that the prototypic rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors required further attenuation before clinical evaluation. A variety of different attenuation strategies and combinations thereof are being evaluated to define a more acceptable attenuation phenotype. A very sensitive mouse LD50 NV model can be used to rank order rVSV vector attenuation level.
