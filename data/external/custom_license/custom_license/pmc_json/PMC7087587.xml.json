The proportion of flu infections in immunocompromised patients described in the literature varies due to the variable nature of the influenza virus itself and its ability to cause annual outbreaks of different intensity. The influenza epidemic during the study period was of high intensity and long duration in Belgium [8]. Overall, 43.9% of samples were positive for non-influenza viruses. The so-called \u201ccommon cold\u201d viruses (rhinovirus and coronavirus) were frequently encountered. This reflects the epidemiology of the adult population living in the community and is in line with findings described in the literature [9\u201312]. In addition to the low prevalence of \u201catypical\u201d bacterial pathogens, which might be explained by the exclusion of samples taken \u2265 14 days after the onset of symptoms, viruses such as bocavirus, adenovirus, and enterovirus were very infrequent in this adult population (< 1%).",

The HSV positivity rate might be underestimated since this target was not present on the TAC used at the St-Jan Brugge-Oostende Hospital. The median Ct value was 29 for P. jirovecii, indicating a significant pathogen load. Nearly all patients with a positive result for P. jirovecii in BAL were treated with high-dose co-trimoxazole during at least 21 days. Some data exist on the epidemiology and impact of opportunistic pathogens such as P. jirovecii [13\u201315], CMV [16, 17], HSV [18\u201320], and Aspergillus species [21] in immunocompromised patients. Quantitative assays or working with (arbitrary) cut-off Ct values seems critical to determine clinical relevance, although every positive result in a BAL sample could be of clinical importance, especially in this group of patients. Ct values above ct28 for Aspergillus species or Pneumocystis may point to a very early phase of reactivation but on the other hand they may correspond to colonization (or contamination).",

The observed differences might be explained by differences in type and level of immunosuppression. Interestingly, influenza A virus and coronaviruses were more common in hematologic oncology patients than in the SOT patients. These rates might have been biased due to the shorter inclusion period in St-Jan Hospital covering the influenza epidemics (but not the RSV peak), where most of these hematology patients were included. Since the two hospitals had a different inclusion profile and since they are geographically separated, this might also have biased the differences in pathogen prevalence between patient groups. However, the two centers are only 95 km from each other, and the climate is similar in both regions.",

The clinical impact of influenza virus infections is well known, but even when all patients positive for influenza viruses were excluded from analysis, the presence of a respiratory pathogen was still associated with need for supplemental oxygen and antiviral treatment. Other studies also revealed a significant association between a positive respiratory virus PCR and the presence of an acute respiratory disease [8, 22\u201324]. In our study however, the association with antiviral therapy may be confounded since the treating clinicians were not blinded to results. At the Erasme Hospital, TAC analysis was performed retrospectively, but the clinicians were aware of conventional viral testing results (based on direct fluorescent antibody testing and viral culture) [3]. At the St-Jan Hospital, clinicians received the results of TAC analysis within 24 h after sampling.",
