Antibodies differentiating between the three subtypes of GD3 influence proliferation of peripheral T lymphocytes in two ways: 9-O-acetylated GD3-specific mAb transfer costimulatory signals [12] whereas mAb U5 against 7-O-acetylated GD3 or GD3-reactive mAb R24 alone are sufficient to induce enhanced proliferation of T cells [13, 14]. In order to distinguish cellular expression and possible different functions of the GD3 carbohydrate sequence and its O-acetylated variants, the three subtypes recognized by specific monoclonal antibodies have been clustered in CD60 a (GD3), CD60 b (9-O-acetylated GD3) and CD60 c (7-O-acetylated GD3) during the Human Leucocyte Differention Antigen Conference (HLDA VII, Harrogate 2000) [15], the CD (cluster defined) nomenclature for these carbohydrate sequences will be used throughout this study where antibody reactions are concerned.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effect on T cell proliferation by CD60 mAb are not known. In general, GD3 gangliosides have been implicated with two major cellular events: 1) gangliosides drive lipid raft formation on lymphocyte surfaces in which key receptors triggering signal cascades are concentrated. In fact, it had been shown that TAG-1, a GPI-anchored neuronal cell adhesion molecule is located in a complex with GD3 and the Src family kinase Lyn within lipid rafts [16]. Whether O-acetylated variants of GD3 direct a different composition of rafts as compared to GD3 itself remains to be settled. 2) It became evident that CD95- or ceramide-initiated apoptosis cascade includes increased formation of intracellular GD3 which in turn induces mitochondrial permeability transition and cytochrome C release [17]. Thus intracellular GD3 propagates lipid-mediated apoptosis while 9-O-acetylation of GD3 suppresses its pro-apoptotic effect [18].",

In another publication a \u201cmigrase\u201d was postulated for the shift of the O-acetyl group from C-7 to C-9 [25]. In order to exclude a possible pH-dependent shift of O-acetyl groups on cell surface expressed sialoglycans in particular during tissue and cell preparations we repeatedly incubated tonsillar B lymphocytes for 10 min in culture medium of various pH values (pH 7.3, 8.0, 9.0). In these experiments we could not observe a shift in binding of CD60 b and c mAb with regard to mean fluorescence intensity and percentage of stained live cells (data not shown). We therefore conclude that a shift of O-acetyl groups from C-7 to C-9 is at least unlikely to occur rapidly on cell surface-expressed CD60 b and c epitopes and that our immunostaining results with the CD60 mAb reflect the natural situation of cell surface-expressed 7-O- and 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans on tonsillar lymphocytes.",

In order to examine whether CD60 b and c sequences are expressed on glycoproteins of tonsillar lymphocytes we applied the enzyme OSGE on live tonsillar T and B cells which cleaves specifically O-linked sialoglycoproteins [26]. Although OSGE considerably reduced expression of the CD45RA sialoglycoprotein on both cell types no influence of OSGE treatment on expression of CD60 b and c was observed (Fig. 1c,d).

CD60 a was strongly expressed on cells within the T cell zone at the border region of the mantle zone and on scattered single cells within the germinal center (Fig. 2a.4). CD60 b was positive on cells in the T cell region, strongly positive on germinal center lymphocytes and only weakly positive in cells of the mantle zone (Fig. 2a.2). The CD60 c mAb showed strong reactivity with cells of the T cell zone comparable with that of CD60 a mAb and staining of fewer germinal center lymphocytes in patchy formation as compared to CD60 b reactivity (Fig. 2a.3). When freshly isolated live tonsillar CD19+ B lymphocytes were separated on a Percoll density gradient it became evident that CD60 a expression on these cells was weak to absent. CD60 b expression increased from high density to buoyant cells (Fig. 2b). Since buoyant cells represent lymphoblasts it is concluded that expression of CD60 b and c increases during B cell activation.

During in vitro cultivation a large proportion of the annexin V low/CD19 high population shifted to stronger annexin V binding. Three color fluorescence of live (via probe negative) CD19+ B cells with annexin V/CD60 b mAb and annexinV/CD60 c mAb revealed during in vitro cultivation from 0 to 72 h an increasing, distinct population of annexinV high/CD60 b high cells as indicated by an arrow (18 h: 5%, 48 h: 16%, 72 h: 19%). A similar population was not observed with CD60 c (Fig. 4b). When apoptosis was induced in freshly harvested tonsillar B cells by staurosporine over a period of 18 h a distinct apoptotic cell population with high CD60 b expression was observed (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, this subpopulation was not seen in untreated annexinV/apo2.7 positive B cells. Stronger expression of CD60 b during the apoptotic process may therefore follow those events which are marked by annexin V binding and staining with mAb apo2.7. Only small changes in CD60 a and CD60 c surface expression on B cells were seen (Fig. 4a). Thus it seems that both CD60 variants have different functions during the apoptotic process of tonsillar B cells. During apoptosis of tonsillar T cells a small population with increased CD60 c and slightly increased CD60 a expression appeared whereas no significant changes of CD60 b expression were visible after staurosporine treatment of CD3+ T cells (Fig. 4a).\n\n",

With regard to CD60 a,b,c expression no major differences were seen between tonsillar CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (data not shown). Interestingly, in contrast to lymphocytes of the T cell zone, tonsillar B cells showed no significant surface expression of CD60 a as demonstrated by missing or weak mAb R24 reactivity and as observed both on native and in vitro cultivated tonsillar B cells. Spotted R24 staining in tonsillar immunohistology in germinal centers may be due to reactivity with T cells in this area.

            "text": "During apoptosis of B and T cells CD60 b and c were differently expressed. Apoptosis is a key regulator system of tonsillar lymphatic development by elimination of negatively selected germinal center B cells [35]. After in vitro staurosporine induction of apoptosis a distinct subpopulation of annexin V positive/Via negative B cells were highly positive for CD60 b but negative for CD60 c. The same was observed with in vitro cultivated B cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis. How can these results be explained in view of the aforementioned observation that 9-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60 b) suppresses GD3 (CD60 a) induced mitochondrial permeability transduction thus preventing apoptosis [18]? Recently it has been shown that CD60 b was induced in Jurkat cells after apoptosis induction with GD3 [36]. In our study we solely describe cell surface phenomena. It may well be that O-acetylated gangliosides fulfill different tasks at the cell surface and within the cell and that surface transport is differentially regulated for GD3 and O-acetylated variants thereof. In first experiments we could observe by flow cytometric analysis of antibody stainings that during staurosporine-induced apoptosis of tonsillar B lymphocytes the cytoplasmic amount of GD3 but not that of 9-O-acetyl- and 7-O-acetyl GD3 is increasing while surface expression of GD3 remains weak (unpublished results).",

            "text": "Since lipid raft plasma microdomains serve as platform for coordinated B cell receptor signaling [29, 30] and given the fact that glycolipids such as CD77/Gb3 on B cells [38] and GM1 and GD3 in neuronal cells [16] have been described as supportive elements for raft formation we investigated whether CD60 b and c gangliosides are present in rafts of tonsillar B cells. It became evident that CD60 b and c are constituents of raft-like structure on plasma membranes of B cells together with GM1 as demonstrated by CTB-binding. In T cells CD60 b appears together with GM1 in rafts whereas CD60 c shows a more homogenous plasma membrane expression. The coincidence of CD60 c surface distribution and mitogenic properties of CD60 c mAb in T cells is a phenomenon which deserves further investigation. It should be noted that mitogenic reagents as for instance PHA or pokeweed mitogen (PWM) lectins although possibly inducing raft formation themselves may not require T- or B-cell receptor enriched rafts for inducing signal transduction during activation. It may be that in T cells, CD60 c is linked to a different activation mechanism as compared to costimulatory signals transferred by CD60 b both in T and B cells and CD60 c in B cells. In corroboration of the contribution of CD60 b and c in B cell activation we found that both ganglioside structures are apparently in close physical proximity to Src family tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn within raft surface domains of tonsillar B cells. Syk and Lyn play a dominant role in the signalling cascade during B cell activation [31]. Together, we postulate from our observations that CD60 b and c have a regulatory role in raft formation for coordinated receptor complexing during B cell activation and provide selection markers for germinal center apoptosis of B cells.",
