Credible estimates are available for specific nutrient shortfalls \u2014 for example, 1.6 billion people suffering iron- or vitamin B12-deficiency anemia15, 0.8 billion people with insufficient dietary energy (that is, calorie) intake16, 33% of pre-school age children and 15% of pregnant women at risk of vitamin A deficiency17 \u2014 but the world still lacks a rigorous, recent assessment of the population suffering shortfalls of any one or more nutrients, although the number is surely in the billions. By 2100, the United Nations projects that the global population will grow by nearly 4 billion, to exceed 11 billion people18. Meeting the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal, to \u201ceradicate hunger\u201d (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/) for this expanding human population will necessitate a large increase in food supplies, with major changes to agricultural production and distribution systems, infrastructure and social protection programmes6 (Fig. 3). Despite large and, in many cases, growing inequalities, the global population is on average expected to become richer, and historically, with greater affluence has come greater consumption of food products in general and more animal-sourced foods in particular, both of which further increase food demand and thus the requirement for agricultural expansion and/or intensification19. Agriculture already occupies about half of the world\u2019s land and uses more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s fresh water20, and recent studies have suggested that agricultural production might need to double or triple by 2100 to keep pace with projected population growth and food demand6\u20138,21 (Fig. 3). Meeting this demand using present agricultural production systems could require replacing >109 hectares of natural ecosystems with agricultural production, approximately 7% of the global land area, which is larger than the continental United States, although continuous efficiency improvements in agriculture will compel re-evaluation of these estimates. In turn, this agricultural expansion could result in an estimated ~2-fold increase in irrigation, ~2.7-fold increase in fertilizer6,10,22 and 10-fold increase in pesticide use (Fig. 3).",

First, the expansion and intensification of agriculture are disproportionately occurring in tropical, developing countries6,22,23, where 75% of deaths are attributable to infectious diseases24, where the risk of disease emergence might be greatest, and where disease surveillance and access to health care, particularly for those infections that accompany extreme poverty, are most limited1,25. Second, agricultural expansion and intensification have historically come with massive habitat conversion, contamination with animal waste and increasing use of agricultural inputs, such as pesticides and antibiotic growth promoters. Beyond their direct adverse effects on human health26,27, agricultural biochemical inputs are known to have direct effects on emerging human infectious diseases, and can also serve as indirect drivers by contributing to the emergence of wildlife diseases28 that constitute important sources of emerging infections in humans1,29. However, the strengthening of agricultural production systems can also improve nutrition, which has pronounced benefits for combating many infectious diseases at the individual and population levels2,30.",

For example, immune responses are energetically costly33 and thus undernutrition often reduces the development and effectiveness of immune responses that can limit or clear infections. The relationship between infectious disease and nutritional status can function in reverse as well, because many parasitic infections place direct demands on host nutrition, causing undernutrition when food is limited34. In fact, some parasites, such as helminths, can even cause eating disorders, such as geophagy (desire to eat soil), bulimia and anorexia35. Enduring infections often require rapid and effective repair of tissue damage caused by parasites, which is also costly. Hence, certain infections can cause undernutrition, which itself can compromise both resistance and tolerance to infections34,36.",

In addition, poor maternal nutrition and associated impaired fetal growth are strongly associated with neonatal death from sepsis, pneumonia and diarrhoea4; undernourishment is a well-understood risk factor for tuberculosis38; and micronutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin A deficiency, have been linked to diarrhoea severity and malaria morbidity in some populations4. Although the traditional Green Revolution approach to food production has succeeded in reducing undernourishment arising from insufficient calorie and protein intake, it has been very slow in reducing micronutrient deficiencies39, which can be have significant effects on defence against disease. To make matters worse, where violence, unrest and terrorism impede access to food, such as in parts of Africa and central Asia, morbidity and mortality attributed to communicable diseases can be further exacerbated2.",

More recently, the early stages of rural development often include rapid expansion of telecommunication, and to a lesser degree, electrification, both of which are promising but underutilized resources for disease monitoring and control in the developing world45. Other rural infrastructure that is more crucial to infectious disease prevention, such as safe water, sanitation and energy supplies, often follows or is developed concurrently43,44. In 43 developing countries, rural infrastructure that provided access to sanitation and safe water explained 20% and 37% of the difference in the prevalence of malnutrition and child mortality rates between the poorest and richest quintiles, respectively46. Moreover, clean water, sanitation and electricity can also facilitate the construction of schools and health clinics that can help to further reduce disease through education, prevention and treatment. Hence, if the history of the developed world repeats itself in the developing world, then it seems plausible that agricultural development necessary to feed 11 billion people might help to reduce infectious diseases by promoting economic development and rural infrastructure.",

Similarly, some of the earliest successes in malaria control at the turn of the twentieth century occurred in the southern United States, where wetland drainage \u2014 including for agricultural conversion \u2014 was one of a suite of anti-transmission strategies used by the Rockefeller Foundation in its landmark malaria control efforts55.",

For example, construction of the Aswan High Dam in Egypt and the accompanying irrigation network was associated with a rise in mosquito vectors and the disfiguring mosquito-borne disease lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as human elephantiasis57. Likewise, dam and irrigation construction resulted in increases in malaria in Sri Lanka and India56,58, and a sevenfold increase in malaria in Ethiopia59. A meta-analysis of 58 studies revealed that humans living near irrigation schemes or in close proximity to large dam reservoirs had significantly higher risk of schistosome infections than humans that did not live near these water resources60, at least partly because of increased freshwater habitat for intermediate snail hosts. Similarly, a recent analysis of schistosomiasis case data from the past 70 years across sub-Saharan Africa showed far-reaching effects of dams and irrigation schemes, with increases in schistosomiasis risk extending up to hundreds of kilometres upstream from the dams themselves61. Hence, dams, reservoirs and irrigation networks related to agricultural expansion are likely to increase vector-borne and waterborne diseases unless water resources are developed in deliberate and coordinated ways to mitigate these risks62.",

Urbanization necessarily extends food supply chains, as consumers reside further from farms and fisheries. Although only 23% of the food produced globally for human consumption is traded across international borders63, globalization is likewise elongating food supply chains. Furthermore, as the costs of international travel have declined over time, the movement of people across borders has likewise increased. The expanded spatial scope and increased frequency, speed and volume of people and agricultural products moving within and among countries necessarily facilitates the spread of pathogens. For example, in Ecuador, there is evidence that the construction of new roads has affected the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases by changing contact rates among people as well as between people and contaminated water sources64. Each year in the United States, there are already an estimated 48 million people with illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths from food-borne infections65, and imported foods \u2014 especially from developing countries with poor sanitation infrastructure and weak food safety enforcement \u2014 have been associated with a rise in food-borne illness66. In addition, globalization is already thought to be a factor in the spread of human influenza viruses that spillover from poultry and swine67,68. Although modernization of food supply chains, especially those linking farms in developing countries to high-income consumers in cities and high-income countries, has typically accelerated the diffusion of stricter food safety and quality standards69,70, as urbanization and globalization further extend food supply chains, enhanced monitoring for the spread of pathogens across transportation networks and strengthened food safety regulations will be needed.",

Currently, such livestock operations are vulnerable to devastating losses of animals to disease. For instance, in just the last 25 years, an influenza A virus (H5N1) and a foot-and-mouth outbreak led to the destruction of more than 1.2 million chickens10 and 6 million livestock in China and Great Britain71, respectively, and a \u2018mad cow disease\u2019 epizootic led to the slaughter of 11 million cattle worldwide10. Similar scenarios have occurred in aquaculture. In the past three decades, there has been more than fourfold growth in industrial aquaculture worldwide72, which should continue to increase as food demand grows and wild fish and shellfish captures push the limits of renewable production73. Bacterial outbreaks in aquaculture are common, especially in developing countries where there are sanitary shortcomings72. In an effort to prevent these catastrophic disease-associated losses and improve animal growth, the agricultural industry uses a larger proportion of global antibiotic and anthelmintic production than human medicine, and most of the antibiotics are provided at non-therapeutic doses in the absence of any known disease74,75. In fact, although estimates are lacking for most countries in the world, in the United States, nearly nine times more antibiotics are given to animals than humans and, of the antibiotics given to animals, more than 12 times as many are used non-therapeutically as therapeutically74.",

For example, livestock are a primary source of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli strains that are pathogenic to humans74. There is evidence that antibiotic-resistance genes acquired from aquaculture are being transferred to human systems and these pathogens have subsequently caused outbreaks72. Anthelmintic resistance is also rife among parasitic worms of livestock and is strongly implied for parasitic worms of humans77. As livestock and aquaculture production expand to address growing food demands, it is likely that current antibiotics and anthelmintics will become less effective because of evolved resistance, and thus infectious diseases of domesticated animals and humans will be more difficult to treat75.",

Although chemical contaminants can be deadly to many free-living stages of parasites, both empirical trends and theoretical models suggest that stress associated with pesticide exposure can increase non-specific or generalist pathogens79,89,90. In addition to the impacts that pesticides can have on infectious diseases, they can also contribute to non-infectious diseases, such as cancers, birth defects, miscarriages and impaired childhood development91, which can further strengthen the poverty\u2013infectious disease trap.

However, studies of the relationship between biodiversity change and infectious disease risk tend to focus on a single parasite or disease, often of non-human animals, which limits the ability to determine more broadly the effects of agricultural intensification on the overall burden of infectious disease in human populations102. Recent studies have found that the local loss of dense forests, largely from agricultural expansion, affected diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections and general fever in Cambodian children103 and infectious disease incidence in Nigerian children over a decade104,105. Proximate causes probably included reduced regulation of microbial contaminants in surface and ground waters, increased smoke from biomass burning, shifts in the ranges of insect vectors and decreased access to forest ecosystem services.",

            "text": "A major concern is the potential for positive feedbacks between poverty, biodiversity loss, soil degradation and infectious disease106,107. Several mechanisms can underpin these reinforcing relationships. The first arises as a result of poor rural peoples\u2019 reliance on limited biophysical assets for their livelihoods. As households clear forests, deplete soils or overharvest biota to meet near-term consumption needs, this resource degradation can compromise future economic productivity and increase disease risk. In addition, poverty, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and disease can quickly become mutually reinforcing responses to natural shocks, such as droughts or floods, or to protracted conflict in a region. There are also more direct examples. For instance, global net losses of tropical forests remained unchanged during the 1990s and 2000s (at approximately 6 million ha yr\u22121 or 0.38% annually108; also see https://glad.umd.edu/projects/global-forest-watch and https://www.globalforestwatch.org) and forest clearing can lead to transmission of zoonotic disease by increasing contact with wild animals. Conversely, encroachment of people and domesticated animals into natural areas can introduce diseases to wildlife that can devastate wild populations and create reservoirs for the disease to be transmitted back to domesticated animals109 (see next section for further discussion and citations). Especially as the agricultural frontier expands, considerable attention must be paid to monitoring and managing these biodiversity\u2013poverty\u2013disease feedbacks106.",

When virulence of a pathogen is tied to its propagule generation within the body (such as occurs with many viral infections), the intermediate virulence hypothesis posits that an intermediate level of virulence maximizes parasite transmission because it balances producing many parasite offspring (increasing parasite fitness) with detriments to host survival due to pathology (decreasing parasite fitness). The balance in this trade-off determines parasite persistence. Hence, as host densities increase and transmission becomes more frequent, the cost of increased virulence declines, shifting the optimum towards higher virulence111. Consequently, for pathogens that experience this virulence trade-off, increases in human, crop and livestock densities have the potential to augment both the incidence and severity of infectious diseases.",

Spillover appears to be a function of the frequency, duration and intimacy of interactions between a reservoir and novel host population112. For example, influenza is believed to have jumped from horses to humans soon after domesticating horses and then made additional jumps to humans from other domesticated animals, such as poultry and swine119. Similarly, when free-range turkeys were prevented from interacting with wild birds and when interactions between domesticated pigs and wild fruit bats were reduced, influenza and Nipah virus incidence dropped, respectively, suggesting wild-animal sources of these infections120,121. In sub-Saharan Africa, the high frequency and duration of environmental interactions between different species of Schistosoma worms infecting humans and cattle has undoubtedly facilitated their hybridization, and these hybrid schistosomes are more virulent to humans than their non-hybrid counterparts122. These factors associated with spillover and disease emergence could be targeted to reduce transmission potential as human populations and agricultural productivity increase.",

The consequences of these pressures might initially increase contact rates between humans and wildlife. This could increase disease risk as bushmeat hunting is already thought to be responsible for several emerging human infectious diseases116. To make matters worse, bushmeat hunting is the second biggest threat to biodiversity behind habitat loss, and biodiversity losses can contribute to disease emergence101. However, if humans overexploit these natural resources, then human\u2013wildlife interactions could eventually decline as species go extinct, which could reduce spillover events.",

For example, empirical evidence supports the notion that defaunation of large vertebrates in Africa should increase zoonotic disease risk by reducing the predators and competitors (large herbivores) of rodents, a common reservoir of human pathogens124. Similarly, overfishing of snail-eating cichlids in Lake Malawi in Africa seems to have been a causal factor in snail population and human schistosomiasis increases there125. Investigations of the effects of overexploitation on infectious diseases remain in their infancy, but the consequences for human populations could be profound.",

That is, human infectious diseases can also impact the agricultural and economic development necessary to feed the growing human population (Fig. 2). For example, the overuse of antibiotics, anthelmintics and pesticides to prevent diseases is driving resistance to these chemicals that will compromise future crop, livestock and aquaculture production. In sub-Saharan Africa, areas with higher historical tsetse-fly abundance, the vector of the parasite (Trypanosoma brucei) that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and cattle, experienced greater lags in the adoption of animal husbandry practices (for fertilizer and labour in agricultural enterprise) that hindered agricultural development and prosperity in Africa long before and after Europeans colonized126. In rural subsistence communities, any source of ill health can significantly impact people\u2019s productivity, yields and agricultural output47\u201349. For example, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS has reduced average life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa by 5 years since 1997, and a Kenyan study found that crop production by rural subsistence-farming families dropped 57% after the death of a male head of household127. Many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) impose devastating productivity losses for affected people that can impede agricultural development from local to national to regional scales49. Some low-income communities appear mired in this poverty\u2013disease trap, and thus might require substantial investment in health systems to promote the necessary agricultural and economic growth to pull them out of the poverty\u2013disease cycle47\u201351.",

In general, rural residents are most vulnerable to these increases in infectious disease, whereas consumers some distance away derive most of the benefits from increased food production. To maximize human health given the impending 11 billion humans projected on the planet by 2100, society must minimize the adverse consequences of agricultural growth while maximizing the health benefits.

After the best model was identified, year was substituted for human population density based on the fit in a. These projections should be evaluated with considerable caution because the models assume that human population size is the only factor that affects fertilizer and pesticide use and the amount of arable and irrigated cropland, when in reality, many factors affect these responses (for example, climate, diets, type of crops grown and so on). They merely illustrate that even an extremely parsimonious model seems to track past patterns tolerably well and thus could serve as a basis for coarse projections.
