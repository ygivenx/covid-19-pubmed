Whether these patterns are specific of severe measles pneumonitis or simply ascribable to sample bias requires further investigation. Another debatable issue is the reliability of chest imaging to correctly identify patients with bacterial superinfection. Our results are inconclusive, primarily because of the small number of patients with CAP (n = 4). As shown in Table 2, there did not seem to be any unambiguous pattern suggestive of superinfection: 2 patients had normal chest X-ray exams, 4 patients had bilateral interstitial opacities, 1 had right-sided alveolar opacities, and 1 had bilateral mixed alveolar and interstitial opacities.",

Accordingly, patients who developed ARDS as a consequence of measles-induced ARDS did so in the later stage of the disease as reflected by the delay between initial symptoms and ICU admission (median, 10 d; IQR, 6\u201319 d).

So far, 5 cases have been reported in kidney transplantation recipients.82 If only a brain biopsy can definitively ascertain the diagnosis of MIBE, the following clinical and laboratory investigations can lend support to this hypothesis: a) normal CSF analysis, b) history of epilepsy both focal and generalized, c) seroconversion during the course of the neurologic disorder, and d) significant clinical improvement after withholding the immunosuppressive regimen. Once again, timely modulation of the patient immunosuppression is critical for both triggering and stalling the neurologic disease progression, at least in the setting of MIBE. This is consistent with previous reports of MIBE in which this complication arises only in case of severe cell-mediated impairment, which causes virus persistence in the central nervous system (CNS) before neurologic symptoms. Apart from transplantation, other clinical settings favorable to MIBE occurrence include mainly HIV infection, chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies, and immunosuppressive therapies for autoimmune diseases.32,82",

Twenty-eight patients (78%) were born during the critical 1980\u20131996 period, in a time of poor immunization rates.

Five patients exhibited respiratory improvement following initiation of intravenous ribavirin therapy. In immunocompromised patients, experience with ribavirin is at best anecdotal and success has been varied in patients with pneumonitis or MIBE.32,50,80 In the current case series, only 2 patients, both of whom were immunocompromised and had severe measles pneumonitis, had a protracted course of ribavirin. Although ribavirin therapy was initiated promptly after the onset of the disease, both of these immunocompromised patients\u2019 respiratory conditions progressed to ARDS, and, ultimately, death. In 1 case, the treatment was withheld after 6 days because of ribavirin-induced hemolysis.

Diagnosis of measles infection in the immunocompromised patient can be challenging in the face of specific complications and absent or atypical morbillous rash. When managing patients with measles pneumonitis using mechanical ventilation, physicians should be aware that these patients may be predisposed to barotrauma. Airway bacterial superinfection, likely to be favored by MV-induced immunosuppression, represents an additional concern and should be actively sought for each time a patient presents with severe respiratory impairment. Immunomodulatory therapy and antiviral treatment with ribavirin may play a role in the management of patients affected by PIE and measles-induced ARDS, but further investigations are needed before they can be considered a standard of care.
