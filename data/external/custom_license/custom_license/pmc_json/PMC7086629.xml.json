            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the aetiological agent responsible for the SARS outbreaks during 2002\u20132003, which had a huge global impact on public health, travel and the world economy [4, 11]. The host range of SARS-CoV is largely determined by the specific and high-affinity interactions between a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor, angiontensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [6, 7, 9]. It has been hypothesized that SARS-CoV was harbored in its natural reservoir, bats, and was transmitted directly or indirectly from bats to palm civets and then to humans [10]. However, although the genetically related SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) has been identified in horseshoe bats of the genus Rhinolophus [5, 8, 12, 18], its spike protein was not able to use the human ACE2 (hACE2) protein as a receptor [13]. Close examination of the crystal structure of human SARS-CoV RBD complexed with hACE2 suggests that truncations in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of SL-CoV spike protein abolish its hACE2-binding ability [7, 10], and hence the SL-CoV found recently in horseshoe bats is unlikely to be the direct ancestor of human SARS-CoV. Also, it has been shown that the human SARS-CoV spike protein and its closely related civet SARS-CoV spike protein were not able to use a horseshoe bat (R. pearsoni) ACE2 as a receptor [13], highlighting a critical missing link in the bat-to-civet/human transmission chain of SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "There are at least three plausible scenarios to explain the origin of SARS-CoV. First, some unknown intermediate hosts were responsible for the adaptation and transmission of SARS-CoV from bats to civets or humans. This is the most popular theory of SARS-CoV transmission at the present time [10]. Second, there is an SL-CoV with a very close relationship to the outbreak SARS-CoV strains in a non-bat animal host that is capable of direct transmission from reservoir host to human or civet. Third, ACE2 from yet to be identified bat species may function as an efficient receptor, and these bats could be the direct reservoir of human or civet SARS-CoV. Unraveling which scenario is most likely to have occurred during the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic is critical for our understanding of the dynamics of the outbreak and will play a key role in helping us to prevent future outbreaks. To this end, we have extended our studies to include ACE2 molecules from different bat species and examined their interaction with the human SARS-CoV spike protein. Our results show that there is great genetic diversity among bat ACE2 molecules, especially at the key residues known to be important for interacting with the viral spike protein, and that ACE2s of Myotis daubentoni and Rhinolophus sinicus from Hubei province can support viral entry.",

Full-length genes were obtained from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum from Hubei province (Rf-HB), R. macrotis from Hubei province (Rm-HB), R. pearsoni from Guangxi (Rp-GX), R. pusillus from Hubei province (Rpu-HB), R. sinicus from Guangxi province (Rs-GX) and R. sinicus from Hubei province (Rs-HB). For the following bat species, amplification of the full-length coding region was not successful, and instead,the N-terminal region was cloned in frame with the C-terminal region of the human ACE2 gene to form a chimeric full-length ACE molecule: R. pearsoni from Guizhou province (Rp-GZ), Myotis\ndaubentonii bat from Yunnan province (Md-YN) and Hipposideros pratti bat from Henan province (Hp-HN). The full-length sequences of bat ACE2 are identical in size to that of hACE2 (805 aa in total). Sequence comparison showed that bat ACE2s are closely related to ACE2s of other mammals and have an aa sequence identity of 80\u201382% to human and civet ACE2. The aa identity of ACE2 from different bat families ranges from 78 to 84%, and within the genus Rhinolophus, the sequence identity increases to 89\u201398%. The major sequence variation among bat ACE2s is located in the N-terminal region, which has been identified in structural studies as the SARS-CoV-binding region [6, 7]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequences of bat ACE2 (sFig. 2) using the MEGA package [14].\n",

Among the bat ACE2s, only MdACE2 (MdACE2) and Rs-HB ACE2 demonstrated significant pseudovirus infection, as deduced from the significantly higher level of luciferase activity in comparison to background activity in the negative control (Fig. 2a). Although such assays are not to be viewed as an absolute quantification of receptor activity, it is nevertheless worth noting that MdACE2-mediated infection seemed to be more efficient than with Rs-HB ACE2. In the same context, it is clear that the bat ACE2s were less efficient overall than the human ACE2 in this particular assay system. The biological significance of this observation remains to be determined. The functionality of MdACE2 and Rs-HB ACE2 as SARS-CoV entry receptors was further confirmed by infection with live virus. As shown in Fig. 2b, both bat ACE2 proteins could clearly support SARs-CoV infection. No attempt was made to quantify infection efficiency in this study due to difficulties encountered in conducting experiments under BSL4 conditions.",

The crystal structure of human SARS-CoV RBD complexed with hACE2 shows that two salt bridges at the SARS-CoV-hACE2 interface, between hACE2 Lys31 and Glu35 and between hACE2 Lys353 and hACE2 Glu38, are both buried in a hydrophobic environment and contribute critically to the SARS-CoV-hACE2 interactions (Fig. 3a, c) [7]. Disturbance of the formation of either of these salt bridges weakens SARS-CoV-hACE2 binding. The Lys31-Glu35 salt bridge at the SARS-CoV-hACE2 interface becomes an Asn31-Lys35 hydrogen bond at the SARS-CoV-Md-YNACE2 interface (Fig. 3b), which possibly weakens virus-receptor binding but still is largely compatible with the virus-receptor interface. Thr27 on hACE2 supports the Lys31-Gu35 salt bridge through hydrophobic interactions with Tyr475 (Fig. 3a); Ile27 on MdACE2 supports the Asn31-Lys35 hydrogen bond more efficiently than Thr27 through tighter hydrophobic interactions with Tyr475 (Fig. 3b). Moreover, Tyr41 on hACE2 supports the Lys353-Glu38 salt bridge (Fig. 3c); His41 on MdACE2 supports the same salt bridge less efficiently than Tyr41 (Fig. 3d). Overall, MdACE2 is an efficient receptor for SARS-CoV, despite the fact that its receptor activity is lower than that of hACE2.\n",

Thus, Rs-HB is a low-efficiency receptor for SARS-CoV. All of the other bat ACE2 molecules contain combinations of the aforementioned key residues that are completely incompatible with virus\u2013receptor interactions. More specifically, they either contain same-charged residues at the 31 and 35 positions, which repel each other, or contain His41 and Lys27, which disfavor SARS-CoV binding (Fig. 1). In particular, Lys27 on some of these bat ACE2 molecules is incompatible with certain hydrophobic residues, such as Leu443 and Phe460, on SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 3a, b).
