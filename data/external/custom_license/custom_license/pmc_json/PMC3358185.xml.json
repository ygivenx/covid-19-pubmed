However, similar to another report (4), we detected increases of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in patients with mild disease during the first 3 days after symptom onset. These different patterns may be caused by different intervals from time of symptom onset to date of sample collection (5 days vs. 3 days) because IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in our study quickly decreased to baseline levels \u22647 days after symptom onset. These results suggest that serum IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels may be increased in patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 within the first 3 days after symptom onset, followed by a decrease to baseline levels \u22645 days after symptom onset in patients with mild disease or a continuous increase in severely affected patients.",
