Among school-age children, viral infection reportedly accounts for 80%-85% of asthma exacerbations, and viruses are more frequently isolated from symptomatic patients than from asymptomatic patients [4]. Although rhinovirus (RV) has frequently been detected in asthmatic patients [4], asthma exacerbations have also been associated with infection with other respiratory viruses, including adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BoV), coronavirus (CoV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus (EnV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus (IfV), metapneumovirus (MpV), parainfluenzavirus (PiV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5]. Unfortunately, the rate of association of viruses with asthma exacerbations remains controversial. A hypothetical explanation might be substantial differences in study design, populations, geographic regions, detection methods, and the type of respiratory tract secretions examined.",

We also did a subgroup analysis to assess the weight of viral infection on asthma exacerbations with respect to geographic region, population, type of respiratory tract secretion examined, and detection method. If only one study was available, we calculated the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) using the Clopper-Pearson exact test. Because difference in the geographic regions, age, study population, type of respiratory tract secretion, and detection method significantly confound the determination of the prevalence of individual viruses, heterogeneity was not assessed in this study.

Asthma exacerbations were mainly associated with RVs (42.1%), highlighting the priority for interventions to reduce the substantial healthcare burden caused by these viruses. This finding has been echoed by the high prevalence of RVs (~40%) among unselected populations residing in North America [10]. In the Netherlands, RVs were most prevalent among symptomatic children during wheezing episodes (41%) and convalescence (26%), as well as in healthy children (25%) [11]. A possible explanation is that RVs are the most common resident pathogens and are prone to cause upper airway infections (e.g., common cold). Consistently, RVs were isolated in 33.0% of pharyngeal exudate samples from Mexicans with acute upper respiratory tract infections [12].",

In patients with other respiratory diseases, the prevalence of these viruses partially mirrored our findings. RSV was reportedly found in 12% of elderly patients with acute respiratory illnesses [13] and in 30.8% in Mexicans with acute upper respiratory tract infection [12], EnV was isolated from 37.0% of young infants with sepsis-like illnesses [14], and BoV was detected in 9.9% of nasopharyngeal aspirates from hospitalized children in Spain [15].

The mechanisms are multifaceted, including 1) necrosis of airway epithelium, ciliostasis and loss of cilia [25\u201327], 2) excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [28], 3) airway hyper-responsiveness and remodeling due to epithelial injury [29], and 4) mucus hypersecretion, which impedes mucociliary clearance [30]. Unfortunately, there are few effective treatment options (e.g., immunoglobins, nebulized antivirals) for direct elimination of viral infections [31, 32]. Preemptive approaches should be directed to the prevention of viral infection, particularly in susceptible populations (e.g. children, pregnant women, the elderly, and patients with comorbidities). This has been exemplified by the vaccine development for prevention of RSV and influenza virus infection [31, 33]. Priority should be given to the most common viruses (e.g., RV, RSV, HSV, EnV, and IfV), which have caused a significant healthcare burden. Recently, a polyvalent vaccine for RV was developed in animal models [34], indicating the possibility of establishing herd immunity using polyvalent or multiple-virus vaccines in future community-based practice, which might help to achieve greater reductions in the prevalence of virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",
