For the S-gene amplification, 18 pairs of primers were designed by using MacVactor computer software (Accelrys Inc, San Diego, CA) based on the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV (GenBank accession no. AY278488) (16). Among them, six pairs (sense/antisense: S1aF/S1aB, S2aF/S2aB, S3aF/S3aB, S4aF/S4aB, S5aF/S5aB, S6aF/S6aB) were used as outer primers, six pairs (sense/antisense: S1bF/S1bB, S2bF/S2bB, S3bF/S3bB, S4bF/S4bB, S5bF/S5bB, S6bF/S6bB) were used as inner primers, and six pairs (sense/antisense: S1cF/S1cB, S2cF/S2cB, S3cF/S3cB, S4cF/S4cB, S5cF/S5cB, S6cF/S6cB) were designed for direct RT-PCR product sequencing. The sequences covering the full-length S gene were amplified separately as six overlapping fragments (F1b, F2b, F3b, F4b, F5b, and F6b) (Figure 1). The one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was used for reverse transcription and the first round of PCR amplification with outer primers. Thermal cycling consisted of 50\u00b0C for 30 min; 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 10 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 57.5\u00b0C for 30 s (decreasing by 1.5\u00b0C every other cycle), 72\u00b0C for 1 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 54\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min. Afterwards, 2 \u03bcL of the product was used as a template for the second round of PCR amplification in 100-\u03bcL volume with inner primers with Taq DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD). Thermal cycling consisted of 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 25 s, 54\u00b0C for 25 s, 72\u00b0C for 50 s. In some cases, Transcript III RNase H\u2013 Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for reverse transcription, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The next two rounds of PCR amplification were performed by using Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase with a higher fidelity (Invitrogen). The reaction condition was set as above, with a twofold elongation at 68\u00b0C instead of 72\u00b0C. All reactions were carefully carried out to avoid contamination.",

Theoretically, a replicating RNA virus expresses a range of genetic and phenotypic variants and has the potential to generate novel virions, which may be selected in response to environmental pressures. RNA viruses generally tolerate high levels of mutagenesis because of their limited genetic complexity (17). Mutations have the potential to be pathogenic (e.g., giving the virus immunity to neutralizing antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, or antiviral drugs [18\u201320]). The dynamics of error copying and sequence decomposition are time-dependent. In HIV infection, for example, one adaptive substitution in the env gene occurred every 3.3 months or 25 viral generations, averaging across patients (21).",

In addition, since virus isolates were not passaged in culture, the whole mutant repertoire is more likely to be detected, since no reverse mutation occurs in cell culture. Our observation most likely reflected the real situation in vivo. Variations were unlikely to result from Taq polymerase errors, since we repeated the experiments for all variations from preparing independent RNA and RT-PCR products and used Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, which has a high fidelity, to confirm the results in some cases. We could not exclude the possibility that some variations were from defective genomes.

The probable reason is that SARS-CoV only causes an acute, self-limited infection, which may prevent persistent long-term mutant development in vivo as occurs in chronic RNA viral infections. Notably, some modules in the S protein remain conserved, e.g., the fusion-important HR domains. Although some variations may predict changes of protein functional features, no obvious correlation exists between mutation and clinical disease manifestation from the limited data reported here. Instead, the variation profile was closely correlated with epidemiography; e.g., patients 3\u20138 were infected in one hospital.",
