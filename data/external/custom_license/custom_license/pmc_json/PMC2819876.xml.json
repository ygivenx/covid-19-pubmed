Cholera may be the most studied and best understood of the waterborne diseases and, perhaps in hindsight, we could have predicted the occurrence of cholera in South America in 1991 (9). Models for cholera prediction, although country specific, are constantly improving. For example, considerable work has gone into predicting outbreaks of cholera in Bangladesh. Remote imaging technologies developed by the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration have been used to relate sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and chlorophyll A levels to cholera outbreaks (Figure 1) (R.R. Colwell and J. Calkins, unpub. data). This process used a composite environmental model that demonstrated a remarkable similarity between predicted rates based on these 3 parameters and actual cholera incidence. These data are far from perfect and considerable uncertainty still remains. For example, rates of cholera were much higher than predicted in January 1998 and January 1999, yet many of the predicted peaks closely aligned with actual incidence. Because the model is constantly being improved and the satellite data are becoming increasingly accurate through ground truthing (real-time collection of information on location), we believe that satellite imaging provides tremendous promise for prediction of cholera, weeks and even months in advance of an epidemic.",

Substantial resources over the past several decades have gone toward eradication, vaccination, treatment, and, more recently, prediction of malaria outbreaks. Satellite imaging has been used to predict the distribution of 5 of the 6 Anopheles gambiae complex species that are responsible for much of the malaria transmission in Africa (13). However, human factors again make accurate prediction of disease events complex. Prediction of a disease event is complicated by host immunity effects, which can result in cycles of infection that would appear to bear no relationship to environmental variables. To predict malaria outbreaks, remote sensing technologies need to be coupled with a better understanding of how specific populations are effected by host immunity, which could allow population susceptibility at any given time to be estimated.",

The 1993 outbreak of HPS in the southwestern United States was believed to be linked to environmental conditions and, in particular, to abnormally high rainfall that resulted in increased vegetation with a subsequent explosion in the rodent populations. Several research groups have subsequently modeled conditions that led to an HPS outbreak, with mixed success. Engelthaler et al. (14) looked at 10 years of data on monthly precipitation and daily ambient temperature in the Southwest region (1986\u20131995) in relation to HPS cases (1993\u20131995). They found that cases tended to cluster seasonally and temporally by biome type and elevation and only indirectly demonstrated a possible association between the 1992/1993 El Ni\u00f1o precipitation events and HPS. Glass et al. (15,16) were also unable to make a definitive link with precipitation events in their analyses of HPS in the southwestern United States. They did, however, find a relationship between Landsat Thermatic Mapper (LTM) images recorded by satellite in 1992 and HPS risk the following year. LTM generates numbers that represent reflected light in 6 bands, 2 of which were associated with decreased risk and 1, in the mid-infrared range, with increased risk. The authors admit that considerable ground truthing is necessary to relate satellite imagery to the environmental variables being measured (i.e., vegetation, soil type, soil moisture) and their relation to rodent population dynamics.",

Their risk analysis for 2006, based on Landsat imagery for 2005, when precipitation levels increased dramatically over prior drought years, suggested an increased risk for HPS, particularly in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. This prediction was unfortunately borne out in the early part of 2006 when 9 cases of HPS occurred within the first 3 months, 6 of those cases in New Mexico and Arizona. However, the anticipated threat to Colorado did not occur, with a fairly typical number of 6 cases, compared with a total of 11 cases for the state in 2005 (18).",

Predictive modeling may lead to improved understanding and potentially prevent future epidemic and pandemic disease. Many respiratory infections are well known as highly climate dependent or seasonal. Although we are not yet able to predict their incidence with great precision, we may well be able to do this in the future. Meningococcal meningitis (caused by Neisseria meningitidis) in Africa is probably the best known example. In the disease-endemic so-called meningitis belt (an area running across sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia), this is classically a dry season disease, which ceases with the beginning of the rainy season, likely as a result of changes in host susceptibility (19). Many other infectious diseases show strong seasonality or association with climatic conditions (20). Perhaps one of the most interesting is influenza, which is thought of as a wintertime disease in temperate climates but shows both winter and summer peaks in subtropical and tropical regions (21). Although the reasons for seasonality are often poorly understood, the close dependence of such diseases on climatic conditions suggests that these, too, are likely to be amenable to prediction by modeling and remote sensing (22).",

Public health agencies in the United States and around the world are focusing on influenza preparedness, notably concerning influenza virus A subtype H5N1, which has captured attention because it causes severe disease and death in humans but as yet has demonstrated only very limited and inefficient human-to-human transmission. The severity of the disease raises images of the 1918 influenza epidemic on an unimaginably vast scale if the virus were to adapt to more efficient human-to-human transmission. Can predictive modeling using satellite or other imaging of environmental variables help in prediction of future influenza pandemics? Xiangming Xiao at the University of New Hampshire was funded in 2006 by the National Institutes for Health to lead a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional team to use remote satellite imaging to track avian flu. Xiao et al. have used satellite image\u2013derived vegetation indices to map paddy rice agriculture in southern Asia (23). They believe that a similar approach can be used in conjunction with the more traditional approach of analyzing bird migration patterns and poultry production (24,25) to map potential hot spots of virus transmission (26).",

Could rapid public health intervention be credited with minimizing spread of disease? In the case of Aceh Province, many communities reported diarrhea as the main cause of illness (in 85% of children <5 years of age), but no increases in deaths were reported, and no outbreaks of cholera or other potentially epidemic diseases occurred (27). Given the massive scale of the disaster, was this likely? In some towns, more than two thirds of the population died at the time of impact, almost 100% of homes were destroyed, and 100% of the population lacked access to clean water and sanitation (27). To a large extent, the Australian army and other groups are to be credited with rapidly deploying environmental health teams to swiftly implement public health measures, including provision of safe drinking water, proper sanitary facilities, and mosquito control measures (28). Widespread fecal pollution of the surface waters was shown, yet the saltiness of the potable water supply after the disaster made much of the water unpalatable. Wells were vulnerable, perhaps to other etiologic agents of fecal origin including viruses and Shigella spp., with greater probability of infection than Vibrio spp., thus leading to the widespread diarrhea.",

Faruque et al. have provided molecular evidence that V. cholerae O139 strains are derived from O1 strains through genetic modification (29). In addition, Chakraborty et al. in Kolkata have seen the presence and expression of virulence genes in several environmental strains of V. cholerae cultured from surface waters (30). Recently, E. coli O157 has been isolated from the Ganges River in India for the first time (31). Indications are that it is metabolically different from E. coli O157 isolated from other parts of the world, but the conditions that have led to these differences are as yet unclear. From the above studies, risk for transmission of virulence genes is likely to be high, but studies of conditions promoting transmission and approaches to modeling resultant disease risks are in their infancy. New epidemic strains could potentially occur through mutation of existing epidemic strains or through gene transfer. Environmental stressors such as chemical contaminants are thought to accelerate both mutation rates and gene transfer (32). Thus, the degree of chemical pollution may need to be a component of disease models (in addition to other stressors).",
