This area of study has been highlighted recently due to the advent of a new strain of pandemic influenza, worries about the possible reintroduction of smallpox and the emergence of new pathogens such as the SARS coronavirus. The mathematical theory pioneered by Ross, MacDonald, Kermack, McKendrick, and others has played a major role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases (see also (1)). More recently, researchers have used mathematical models to better understand influenza dynamics and to investigate how to effectively control influenza via various strategies including antiviral treatment and vaccination (see, for example, (2\u20136)).",

In that study, we fit the model to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza data collected during early months of the year, optimizing the model parameters associated with the time-dependent transmission, and the time at which the initial case was introduced. The optimized model was then used to forecast the timing of the autumn wave of infection (see (8)). The most striking feature of the model is that it accurately predicted the peak time of the pandemic. According to the CDC 2009 H1N1 surveillance reports (9), the peak of the fall wave was reached at the end of October (which is between weeks 42 and 43, see the left-hand plot in Fig. 1), which is consistent with our model result (see the right-hand plot in Fig. 1).\n",

The function \u03b2(t) given in (2.4) has its maximum at the beginning of a calendar year. When the transmission rate is expressed in this form, the time of introduction of the pathogen to the population t0 is a crucial parameter of the seasonal model because the final size and shape of the epidemic curve (including how many peaks the epidemic exhibits within one calendar year) can depend quite strongly on this parameter (whereas for models with constant \u03b2, the final size and shape are independent of t0).

By incorporating the randomness of disease transmission process, the models will be capable of providing helpful information about how likely a certain disease outcome will be expected under a given condition. One of the approaches for stochastic simulations is the event/time approach (10). Consider the model (2.1) with constant transmission rate \u03b2.

Most results are based on numerical simulations. In this section, we present examples in which the transmission rate \u03b2(t) has the form as in (2.4), with possible delayed vaccination uses, i.e., tv \u2265 t0. These scenarios are based on the consideration that vaccines and antiviral drugs may not be available at the beginning of an epidemic. We will again focus on three important measures when assessing the effect of a control program: (a) peak size of the epidemic curve (the maximum number of infections during the course of a pandemic), (b) peak time (the time at which the peak occurs), and (c) final size (the total number of infections at the end of a pandemic). Main objectives of effective control strategies should include lowering the peak size to keep demand for facilities below available supply, lowering the final size to reduce morbidity, and delaying the peak to provide more time for response.",

To demonstrate this, we first consider the simpler case in which the model (2.1) with the initial conditions given in (2.3) is used.

Simulations illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 show how the peak and final epidemic sizes may vary with p0 (the levels of vaccination), f0 (drug treatment), and tv (the starting time of vaccination). Figure 9 plots the epidemic curves and final epidemic sizes for the case of t0 = 35 under various levels of vaccination (p0) without treatment (f0 = 0). Notice that for t0 = 35, there is only a single peak in the epidemic curve in the absence of vaccination and treatment (see a). Simulation results for two different values tv are demonstrated in the middle panel (tv = 60) and the bottom panel (tv = 100). In each panel, outcomes for three p0 values are compared. A dramatic difference is that for the case of tv = 60 the peak and final epidemic sizes exceed those without vaccination use, whereas for the case of tv = 100 the peak and final size decrease monotonically with increasing p0. We need to point out that although this set of simulations suggest that an earlier start of vaccination use is not beneficial (due to an increased peak and final sizes), this may not be the cases for other values of t0 (simulations not shown here). That is, whether and how much vaccination can help to reduce the severity of epidemics depends jointly on tv and t0.\n",

Particularly, the outcomes demonstrated in Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 suggest that in some cases, the uses of vaccine and treatment may have a detrimental consequence (e.g., increasing peak and/or final epidemic sizes), and that whether and how much vaccination and treatment can be helpful will depend critically on the time of introduction of infection (t0), the starting time of vaccination use (tv), and the levels of vaccination and treatment (p0 and f0).

These heterogeneities include age-dependent transmission rate, multiple viral strains (including drug-resistant strains), age or spatial variations in contact patterns, etc. We have previously studied the effects of some of these heterogeneities on the disease dynamics (2,11\u201314).

These plots show the dramatic effect that the start time of an epidemic (t\n0) can have on its progression in a periodic environment given by the SIR model (2.1) with initial conditions (2.2), where I\n0 = 1 and N = 107. From the plots in a and c we observe that when t\n0 = 30, vaccination reduced both the peak size and the peak time although there is not much delay in the peak time. However, plots in b and d show that, although the size of the first epidemic peak is reduced, a second (and higher) peak is also generated. More significantly, the final epidemic size is increased, showing the sensitivity of the behaviors of the epidemic to t\n0\n",

It shows the joint influence of t\n0 and p\n0 on the effect of vaccination programs. The initial conditions used are the same as in Fig. 7. Plots in a show that the peak and final sizes are decreased when p\n0 is increased from 0.05 (see a1 and a4) to 0.1 (see a2 and a5). However, when p\n0 continues to increase from 0.1 to 0.15, one epidemic peak becomes two with the second peak higher than the first (see a3 and a6), and the final epidemic size is larger than the case of p\n0 = 0.1. This differs from the case of t\n0 = 40 shown in b. In this case, for the lower p\n0 value (p\n0 = 0.1) two peaks occurred and the final size is higher than that without vaccination use (compare b1 and b4). However, when p\n0 exceeds 0.22 the peak and final sizes will not be higher than those without vaccination use. Both peak and final sizes will continue to decrease when p\n0 increases (see b2\u2013b3 and b5\u2013b6)",

These plots of epidemic curves and final epidemic sizes are for the case of t\n0 = 35 with two values of t\nv (the time when vaccination begins) under three different levels of vaccination (p\n0) and no treatment (f\n0 = 0). The model used is (2.5) with initial conditions (2.6), where I\nu0 = 1 and N = 305 million. Notice that there is only a single peak in the epidemic curve in the absence of control (see a); a is for the case of no vaccination (p\n0 = 0). Two different starting times of vaccination (t\nv) are examined: b\u2013d are for t\nv = 60, whereas e\u2013g are for t\nv = 100. For each t\nv value, three levels of vaccination use are considered: p\n0 = 0.1 (b and e), p\n0 = 0.2 (c and f), and p\n0 = 0.4 (d and g). The peak of the epidemic curve and the final epidemic size are displayed for each of the scenarios. The following observations can be made. (1)For the earlier start of the vaccination program (t\nv = 60), a lower level of vaccination (p\n0 = 0.1) may lead to an increased peak and final size (compare the sizes in b with those in a), while a higher level of vaccination (p\n0 = 0.4) can dramatically decrease the peak and the final size (compare d with a). (2) For the later start of the vaccination program (t\nv = 100), the use of vaccines did not increase the peak or final sizes (see e\u2013g). (3) In all cases illustrated in b and d, the time to epidemic peak is delayed, and more delay in the peak time is expected for higher levels of vaccination use. Other parameter values are the same as before",
