            "text": "Vesicle secretion is an essential step for many physiological and pathophysiological processes. By releasing specific, submicron-sized vesicles, cells communicate or cross-talk with other cells and the surrounding microenvironment/systems. These cell-derived exovesicles are generated from intracellular compartments or the plasma membrane through a series of fusion and fission events. Although the origins/functions of these cell-derived exovesicles are various, their fundamental biophysical properties (e.g. fusogenicity) are similar. Most exovesicles have the capability to fuse with target cells in order to deliver cargo and transmit information. For example, the exovesicles secreted by mature dendritic cells (DCs), a type of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), bear antigen-loaded MHC molecules. When these exovesicles fuse with immature DCs, the antigens are transferred from mature to immature DCs [1]. This process could increase the number of APCs and amplify the immune responses. Besides information transmission mediated by fusion, the surface of a secreted vesicle can also serve as an antigen/biomarker-loaded presentation platform for various purposes [2]. This is best illustrated with the many types of tumor cell-derived microvesicles and exosomes. The tumor antigen-loaded exovesicles usually function to suppress a wide spectrum of immune responses, but some of them secreted under stress could also counterintuitively activate the immunity [2\u20137]. In recent years, our understanding for the compositions and functions of cell-secreted vesicles has grown exponentially [2, 8, 9]. This report explores a lesser known aspect about the physical mechanism of vesicle biogenesis.",

Another universal regulator is membrane potential stability, which is largely contributed by background K+ channels [11, 12]. Many background K+ channels, known as two-pore K+ (K2P) channels, share a unique two-pore (P) and four-transmembrane (2P/4TM) configuration per channel subunit. The K2P (KCNK) channel family is extensively distributed in eukaryotes, and can be further divided into six subfamilies (TWIK, TREK/TRAAK, TASK, THIK, TALK, and TRESK) based on their primary sequence homology and channel properties [11]. Compared to other potassium channel families, K2P channels play fundamental physiological functions, such as maintenance of membrane potential stability and regulation of cellular excitability, and are thus considered to have evolved earlier than the other K+ channel families [11].",

Ion channels or channel-like proteins encoded by viruses are collectively called viroporins [14]. The functions of viroporins by and large remain unclear [14, 15]. Interestingly, besides HIV-1 Vpu, murine hepatitis virus E protein and SARS coronavirus 3a protein are also viroporins capable of accelerating virus release [19\u201321].

Vpu has a tremendous ability to interact with a wide range of host proteins [13, 23\u201329], including KCNK3 (also known as TASK-1), and to modify or destroy their normal physiological functions [13, 30, 31]. In mammalian heterologous expression systems, KCNK3 channel activities are diminished upon Vpu co-expression, whereas Vpu-mediated viral release is suppressed by KCNK3 channel activities [13]. When Vpu is expressed alone in primary T cells, it could behave like KCNK3/9/15 siRNA that reduces endogenous KCNK3/9/15 expression and depolarizes the cell membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8) [16]. Notably, the efficiency of Vpu-assisted HIV-1 release is directly correlated with the degree of membrane potential depolarization [16]. Indeed, membrane potential stability contributed by KCNK3 channels is detrimental to Vpu-mediated virus release [16].",

As a proof of concept, the first aim of this study was to identify the role of KCNK3/9/15 (TASK1/3/5) channels during the exocytosis process. We previously demonstrated that depolarization by KCNK3/9/15 knockdown could accelerate HIV-1 viral release [16]. Here we found that membrane depolarization by KCNK3/9/15 siRNA or by Vpu also promoted the release of cell-derived, nonviral vesicles. Some of these cell-derived exovesicles were exosomes, enriched with the lipid second messenger\u2014ceramide. To further dissect the nature of depolarization-stimulated secretion in vivo, we measured intracellular K+ (Kin+) in Vpu+ cells, and found it to be depleted to a pathologically low level. Reduction of intracellular K+ drives membrane potential depolarization. In contrast, heterologous expression of KCNK3 channels in primary T cells maintained Kin+, thereby reinforcing membrane polarization and suppressing depolarization-stimulated exocytosis. Our results identify the \u0394\u03c8-modulatory function of KCNK3/9/15 channels and Vpu viroporin in the exocytosis process.",

Because this siRNA sequence also matches homologous KCNK9 (89%) and KCNK15 (95%), it is named KCNK3/9/15 siRNA. From RT-PCR experiments, the KCNK3/9/15 siRNA reduced ~90% of KCNK3 at the transcription level in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2a). The knockdown efficiencies for KCNK9 or KCNK15 have not been evaluated, because KCNK9 or KCNK15 mRNA was not found in the cell lines we commonly used (e.g. HEK-293 cells).\n",

In particular, we were interested in the fraction of exosomes in the secretion pool, since exosomes are biologically important and have been well characterized. We first confirmed that human reticulocyte-derived exosomes were enriched with transferrin receptor (TrnR). For convenience, we then used K562 cultured cells (of an erythroleukemic type) to generate sufficient quantities of exovesicles for this study. K562 cells were transiently transfected with GFP or GFP/Vpu, and the exovesicles secreted from these cells were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Some of the exovesicles secreted from K562 cells also expressed transferrin receptors (TrnR), suggesting that they might be exosomes. On the other hand, not many exovesicles secreted from K562 cells or human reticulocytes expressed CD81, a tetraspanin protein and an exosome marker specific for antigen-presenting cells (data not shown). Since exosome markers are cell type-dependent, and both K562 cells and reticulocytes are not antigen-presenting cells, their exovesicles should indeed contain very little CD81. Because membrane potential depolarization should be a universal, physical mechanism for stimulation of secretion, we chose a more generalized biomarker\u2014ceramide, to characterize these exovesicles. Ceramide is a marker for the Golgi apparatus, exosomes, and the secretory pathway for exosomes [35, 49]. We established a flow cytometry-based quantitative method for ceramide. Since the cell-derived exovesicles were too small (<200 nm in diameters) for flow cytometry, they were first labeled with BODIPY TR C5-ceramide, and then coated onto aldehyde/sulfate-treated latex beads. We found that most reticulocyte-derived exosomes were loaded with ceramide (91.1%, Fig. 4c). The ceramide levels were significant in ~42.7% of the exovesicles originated from GFP+ cells, and in ~50.1% of the exovesicles from GFP/Vpu+ cells (Fig. 4c). There were also populations of non-exosome vesicles in the secretion. Interestingly, Vpu expression might be able to promote exosome secretion, as it slightly increased the proportion of exosomes in the exovesicle pools.",

Noticeably, heterologous expression of Vpu alone in the activated CD4+ T cells rendered the cells to be significantly less sensitive to [K+]out changes, indicating a lack of K+ channel expression on their plasma membrane (Fig. 5a). Importantly, the intracellular K+ content was significantly lower in Vpu+ cells (Fig. 5a).

            "text": "The resting membrane potentials for most cell types range from \u221240 to \u221295 mV [52], and the electric field across a biomembrane is in the order of 105V/cm [53]. This stored energy in a biomembrane is undoubtedly a significant energy constraint for any structural transition of the membrane. A relatively small reduction of \u0394\u03c8 (such as the induced depolarization presented here) could accelerate the rate of membrane fusion/fission and increase secretion. In this study, we demonstrated that depolarization by manipulating K+ gradients across the cell membrane could independently promote the release of membranous particles from common cultured cell lines (i.e. HEK-293 and HeLa cells) and from activated human CD4+ T cells (Figs. 1, 2). Depolarization by heterologous expression of Vpu also stimulated the release of nonviral vesicles in primary T cells (Fig. 3). Since depolarization could lower the electrostatic repulsion on a vesicle-budding membrane [16, 53], our results suggest that the electric field across a cell membrane is an important energy barrier for vesicle biogenesis/secretion.",

Notably, Vpu can independently facilitate apoptosis [55], so Vpu-mediated apoptosis might conceivably require the viroporin activity to disrupt intracellular K+ homeostasis and \u0394\u03c8. In comparison, heterologous expression of KCNK3 in human CD4+ T cells prevented pathological leak of Kin+ (Fig. 5a) and stabilized the cells at polarized potentials (Fig. 5b). Could KCNK3, an antagonist of Vpu, exert protection against apoptosis during HIV-1 infection? Liu et al. [56] have shown that membrane hyperpolarization driven by various K2P channels, including KCNK3, inhibits activation of apoptosis during cell stress in cultured rat hippocampal slices. On the other hand, Lauritzen et al. [57] have shown that KCNK9 channels could result in Kin+ depletion and activation of apoptosis instead. Conceivably, the differences in KCNK channel activities, \u0394\u03c8 stability, and cellular regulation of KCNK expression could all influence Kin+ homeostasis directly, resulting in inhibition or activation of apoptosis.",

After 45 min of incubation in high K+, the cells were fixed with an equal volume of 5% glutaraldehyde, followed by OsO4 fixation. The cells were then gently spun down in a microcentrifuge tube for embedding and copolymerization. Thin-sections of the cells in resin blocks were visualized by TEM (JEOL JEM-1200EXII). Bar = 500 nm. b To validate the membrane quantitation method by TMA-DPH, Jurkat cells were divided into 4 groups of different cell numbers (ranging from 4.5 \u00d7 104 to 4.5 \u00d7 105 cells per group) for TMA-DPH labeling. The labeled cells were excited at 350 nm, and their emission was collected at 420\u2013490 nm. For each E\nm wavelength tested, the fluorescence emission intensities all exhibited linear correlations with the quantities of cells or cell membrane (r\n2 > 0.99). Shown here were the linear correlations at E\nm 420 nm and 430 nm. c HeLa cells were plated in 6-well culture inserts of 0.4-\u03bcm-porous membrane. After 24\u201330 h of siRNA transfection, culture media outside the insert in each well were replaced with fresh ones, and a fraction of the sieved media (outside the culture insert in a well) were collected every 15 or 30 min for TMA-DPH labeling. As revealed by the TMA-DPH emission spectra at t\n0 and t\n30 (30 min of membrane secretion), the fluorescent emission of TMA-DPH was greatly enhanced upon binding to the exocytosed membranes. The maximal emission of TMA-DPH was determined at 445 nm excitation, and the E\nm at this excitation wavelength will be used for all the quantitative comparison below. d Membrane potential depolarization induced by a high-K+ buffer stimulated vesicle secretion. At t\n0, the culture inserts layered with HeLa cells were transferred to wells containing HBSS (5 mM K+) or a high K+ balanced buffer (60 mM K+). A fraction of the buffer outside the porous inserts was retrieved at each time point for TMA-DPH staining. At the end of secretion collection, the cells on the culture inserts were resuspended and transferred to a 96-well plate for measurements of TMA-DPH fluorescence intensities. The variations of cell membrane quantities from set to set were relatively small (<5%), as compared to the changes due to high K+ stimulation (>50% in general).
