For these purposes, 100-\u03bcL aliquots of up to 96 blood samples were pooled. The complete pool of up to 9.6 mL was centrifuged at 58,000\u00d7 g for 60 min at 4\u00b0C. Viruses were extracted by using spin columns, and nucleic acid was eluted in a total volume of 75 \u03bcL. Only 60 \u03bcL of extract is needed for routine NAT screening. A residual volume of 15 \u03bcL can then be used for additional NAT testing (5) for influenza viruses.",

The test consists of 2 individual amplification reactions. In the first step, a generic influenza PCR is performed. The specificity of this reaction was demonstrated for all subtypes of influenza A (H1\u2013H15, N1\u2013N9) and all subtypes of influenza B. Samples with a positive test result in the first PCR were analyzed in a second PCR with influenza (H5N1)\u2013specific primers and probes.

The viral RNA concentration was determined in an external laboratory by multiple quantitative real-time PCR determinations (7). Different dilutions of the external influenza (H5N1) subtype quantification standard (0.0, 0.91, 1.96, 3.91, 7.81, 15.63, 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250 PFU/mL) were prepared, and 100 \u03bcL of each dilution was spiked into 9.5-mL negative plasma pools. Each dilution was repeatedly spiked and tested in 8 minipools. Five microliters of the extract was analyzed with the generic influenza NAT as well as with the specific influenza (H5N1) NAT. Results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Blood donor screening by NAT was made technically and financially feasible by creating minipools of up to 96 individual samples per pool. Roth et al. demonstrated an efficient enrichment for all tested viruses in plasma samples (9). In the absence of an infective donor, different concentrations of the new influenza genotype H5N1 were spiked into minipools of 95 samples. As shown in Table 2, the influenza (H5N1) subtype was detected by the generic influenza primers as well as by the influenza (H5N1)\u2013specific primers when our routine minipool screening procedure was used. Sensitivity was expressed as PFU/mL and can be converted into viral genome copy number according the calculation of Yoshikawa et al. (7). Therefore, the analytical sensitivity was \u2248804 geq/mL and 444 geq/mL for a generic influenza and for the influenza (H5N1) subtype, respectively.",

As with other viruses, a viremic phase of infection can be assumed to precede clinical symptoms such as fever (13,14). Recently Chutinimitkul et al. (15) detected influenza (H5N1) virus (3,080 copies/mL) in the plasma of a 5-year-old boy, which indicates a viremic phase of influenza (H5N1) infection. Those donors may be infective, especially to immunosuppressed patients. In addition to quarantine of infected patients, treatment with antiviral drugs, and development of avian influenza vaccines, blood donors should be tested during a pandemic to avoid transfusion-transmitted infections. Our study demonstrates that NAT screening could be incorporated into blood testing without delay and that the influenza virus could be sufficiently enriched by centrifugation. Sensitivity of our influenza-screening method would have been sufficient to detect recently reported virus concentrations in plasma of infected persons (15). However, as with all minipool methods, infections can be transmitted to transfusion recipients on rare occasions because the viremia level in the donor is below the analytical sensitivity of the screening assay.",
