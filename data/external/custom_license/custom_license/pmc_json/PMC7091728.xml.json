The mortality of this disease is higher and therefore few hundreds of people have died from the disease. In the absence of effective vaccines and drugs, infectious diseases such as SARS that is spread by the respiratory route must be taken very seriously. It is very important that public health officials are able to identify people infected with SARS at early stages of the disease and isolate them for an appropriate time, thus the cycle of transmission can be broken. Voluntary isolation and quarantine are of great inconvenience for a lot of people, but they are currently our best tools to save lives2. An accurate diagnosis method for SARS is urgent needed and it will be great helpful for people against SARS3, 4, 5.",

After blocking with PBS containing 3% gelatin/0.1% Tween 20, and the plates were incubated with diluted rabbit antisera at various concentrations at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Bound antibodies were determined with HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-rad) and the OD values were measure by microplate autoreader (Bio-tek) at 450 nm. Nine SARS patients (clinical diagnosed) and 4 health controls were selected and their sera were collected. All the sera from patients were confirmed IgG positive by an ELISA with whole virus lysate as coating antigen and immunoflurorences assay (IFA). The reactivities of the peptides (N1 and N2) to the sera were measured by ELISA. The protocol was similar as mentioned above. The sera dilution was 1:10 and HRP-coupled goat anti-human IgG (Bio-rad) was used to detect IgG antibodies in the sera. All the experiments that were in volved in using the patients' sera were carried on in Bio-safety Level 3 laboratory.",
