            "text": "Foodborne illnesses associated with contaminated food continue to plague public health as well as world economies. The economic cost of foodborne illnesses is approximately $152 billion in the US alone (Scharff 2010). Enteric viruses, particularly human norovirus (NV) and hepatitis virus type A, are the leading causes of viral foodborne illnesses (Anonymous 2012; Koopmans and Duizer 2004). Human NV, one of the top five highest-ranking pathogens with respect to the total cost of foodborne illness in the US, belongs to family Caliciviridae and is a well-known cause of \u201cwinter-vomiting disease\u201d or \u201cstomach-flu\u201d (ECDC 2013; Scharff 2012). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2013) reported that NV causes 19\u201321 million cases of acute gastroenteritis annually in the US and leads to 1.7\u20131.9 million outpatient visits, 400,000 emergency room visits, 56,000\u201371,000 hospitalizations, and 570\u2013800 deaths, mostly among young children. More than half of all foodborne disease outbreaks due to a known cause reported to CDC from 2006 to 2010 was attributed to NV. In the European Union, caliciviruses (primarily NV) were responsible for 507 of 675 foodborne viral outbreaks (European Food Safety Authority 2009).",

In addition, recent experiments with NV in a variety of foods revealed that freezing, cooling, and mild heat treatment (minimal food processing) were not effective in significantly reducing virus titers (Mormann et al. 2010). Thus, development of novel, efficient and safe strategies for controlling viral contamination of foods is of great interest to food scientists and food producers. In this regard, biopreservation (control of one organism by another) has received much attention in the last decade (Dali\u00e9 et al. 2010).",

Lactococcus lactis (formerly, Streptococcus lactis) is one of the most important LABs. It is a Gram-positive bacterium used extensively in the production of butter milk and cheese (Madigan et al. 2012). Other uses include the production of pickled vegetables, beer or wine, bread, and other fermented foodstuff, such as soymilk kefir. This organism has a homofermentative metabolism and produces l-(+)-lactic acid (Samar\u017eija et al. 2001). It can also produce d-(\u2212)-lactic acid when cultured at low pH (\u00c5kerberg et al. 1998). The capability to produce lactic acid is one of the reasons why L. lactis is one of the most important microorganisms in the dairy and food industries and has achieved the GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status (FDA 2012).The present study was undertaken to determine the antiviral activity of L. lactis subsp. lactis LM0230 against feline calicivirus (FCV), a surrogate of NV.",

As shown in Fig. 1, there is no significant decrease (P \u2265 0.01) in FCV titer after pre-treatment of CRFK cells either with raw or pH 7-adjusted BGMF. The time of pre-treatment also had no significant effect (P \u2265 0.01).\n(ii)\nPre-treatment of cells with BCS, the CRFK cells were pre-treated with various BCS volumes (20, 50, and 100 \u00b5L) to examine the effect of number of bacterial cells on the capability of CRFK cells to support FCV replication. The cells were pre-treated for 30, 60, or 90 min for each BCS volume. Except for a little decrease in FCV titer (0.5 log10 TCID50/0.1 mL) with CRFK treated with 100 \u00b5L of BCS for 90 min, neither bacterial cell count nor the treatment time had any significant effect on FCV titer (P < 0.01; data not shown).(iii)\nPre-treatment of FCV with BGMF, the pre-treatment of FCV with raw BGMF for 30 min, 90 min, and 24 h resulted in significant reductions (P < 0.01) in FCV titer by approximately 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 log10 TCID50/0.1 mL, respectively, whereas pre-treatment with pH 7-adjusted BGMF led to non-significant decreases (P \u2265 0.01) with all pre-treatment times (Fig. 2).\n(iv)\nPre-treatment of FCV with BCS (virus adsorption to bacterial cells), the pre-treatment of FCV with BCS containing 1 \u00d7 108, 2 \u00d7 108 and 3 \u00d7 108 CFU of L. lactis LM0230 resulted in non-significant decreases (P \u2265 0.01) in FCV titers at either 30 or 90 min (Fig. 3).

There were lower decreases in FCV titers with higher dilutions of pH 7-adjusted BGMF (1.3 and 1.0 log10 TCID50/0.1 mL with 1:5 and 1:10 dilutions). Similar trend was seen with co-treatment with raw BGMF. The highest decrease in FCV (P < 0.01) was attained with MNTD (1:10 dilution) of raw BGMF followed by 1:20 dilutions to be 1.5, 1.3 log10 TCID50/0.1 mL reduction, respectively.

The main difference between the two types of BGMF is the status of lactic acid excreted in the growth medium by L. lactis. Lactic acid was neutralized by sodium hydroxide in pH 7-adjusted BGMF. Therefore, its effect was eliminated by transforming lactic acid into its sodium salt (sodium lactate) at pH 7.0. This explanation is supported by a similar study in which pre-treatment of FCV with 0.3 % d,l-lactic acid solution (pH 3.4\u20133.5) at 20 \u00b0C led to 1.3 log10 reduction in FCV titer (Straube et al. 2011).

They attributed this reduction to the adsorption or binding of the virus on the surface of LAB strains probably because peptidoglycans in the cell walls of LAB trapped the virus (Boti\u0107 et al. 2007). The cell wall of L. lactis is also known to have a peptidoglycan structure consisting of A4\u03b1-type peptidoglycan, with a monomer primary structure (GlcNAc-MurNAc-l-Ala-\u03b1-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala) and a d-Asp in the interpeptide bridge, attached to the \u03b1-amino group of Lys (Courtin et al. 2006).

            "text": "In co-treatment experiments, the FCV titers were reduced by both types of BGMFs, but complete inhibition of FCV infectivity was only attained when undiluted pH 7-adjusted BGMF was used (Fig. 4). We hypothesize that the extracellular metabolites of L. lactis excreted in BGMF might prevent the attachment of FCV to the cells affecting its entrance into the cells. The observed antiviral activities of pH 7-adjusted BGMF indicate that lactic acid may not be the key factor in this action where it was transformed to sodium lactate during pH adjustment of BGMF. It has been reported previously that metabolites of L. lactis such as bacteriocins (Akko\u00e7 et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2000; Samar\u017eija et al. 2001) and hydrogen peroxide (Grufferty and Condon 1983; Samar\u017eija et al. 2001; Van Niel et al. 2002) may be responsible for such action. Antiviral activity of bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like substances produced by LAB, probiotics, and certain other bacteria has been reported (Ermolenko et al. 2010; Saeed et al. 2007; Todorov et al. 2005; Torres et al. 2013; Wachsman et al. 2003). Hydrogen peroxide is also a well-known antiviral substance (Roberts and Antonoplos 1998). Antiviral activity of probiotic bacteria against VSV has been attributed to their metabolites (Boti\u0107 et al. 2007).",

In similar work, the infectivity of VSV was decreased by 60 % when IPEC-J2 cells co-infected with VSV and different LAB strains (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and VSV (Boti\u0107 et al. 2007). Our results are also in agreement with Maragkoudakis et al. (2010) who observed significant decreases in infectivity of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and RV when hosting cells co-infected with the viruses in presence of Lactobacillus sp. It was hypothesized that LAB cells induced release of reactive oxygen species such as NO\u2212 and H2O2, which may be responsible for killing the studied viruses (TGEV and RV; Maragkoudakis et al. 2010). Competition between bacterial cells and FCV for attaching to the functional receptors on the cells may also help elucidate these results. It is also possible that LAB may establish a \u201ccross talk\u201d (some sort of signaling) or alter the state of the epithelial cells and macrophages, which leads to an antiviral response as suggested by Boti\u0107 et al. (2007).",

First, the lower pH related to the excretion of lactic acid by LAB may be responsible for denaturation of capsid proteins of the virus preventing its attachment to host cells. Second, the peptidoglycan structure of LAB may trap viral particles. Third, production of different metabolites (such as bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide) can prevent the entrance of the virus into host cells thereby inhibiting its replication. Finally, the competition between the bacterial cells and the virus for attachment on host cells may be occurred. In addition, the induction effect of the bacterium for the host cells to produce reactive oxygen substances might kill the virus.",

Although preliminary, the results presented here are of particular importance and merit further investigation to understand deeply the mechanisms of LAB and probiotics antiviral effect and to study its activity in food models.",
