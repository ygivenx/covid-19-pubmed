An association was considered statistically significant if 2-sided tests of significance had a p-value <0.05. To examine independence of effects, multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed by using the conditional logistical regression (CLogit) function in Stata/SE 8.0 for Windows (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Any variables with p<0.2 after matched analysis were included in the initial model. A backward stepwise variable- selection strategy was used to construct a final model with a significance level of >0.1 for removal and a significance level of <0.05 for re-entry into the model. Persons missing data for variables under study were excluded from any analysis involving the missing variable. Collinearity was assessed by generating a correlation coefficient matrix for all variables to be considered for inclusion in the regression model. The presence of effect-measure modification by age and sex was assessed for all variables in the final model by entering product terms. A final model was achieved by entering the variables retained in the backward selection model.",

Although not surprising, these findings reinforce the hypothesis that close contact with infected domestic poultry is the primary source of transmission of influenza H5N1 to humans. The absence of a statistical association between infection and contact with other animals such as pigs, cats, or dogs is reassuring. Replication and excretion of H5N1 by asymptomatic domestic waterfowl has been demonstrated and is a plausible source of infection for humans (11); however, although a 1997 case-control study found that visiting live poultry markets was a risk factor for human influenza A H5N1 infection (2), our study and the study from Thailand (9) did not identify contact with healthy poultry as a risk factor. However, viral titers in asymptomatic waterfowl may be much lower than in diseased poultry (11) and may therefore pose a low risk to humans, which our study was underpowered to identify.",

Use of this tool introduces a selection bias that favors finding greater exposure to sick poultry among case-patients than other groups, regardless whether the relationship is causal. In our study, clinicians were not using a systematic screening tool to identify possible H5N1 case-patients, but knowledge of poultry as the source of human H5N1 infection was ubiquitous. Possibly, H5N1 case-patients who did not have exposure to sick poultry may have been less likely to be identified than case-patients who did report this exposure. However, 5 of the 28 case-patients (18%) did not report exposure to sick poultry, indicating that exposure to sick poultry was not a prerequisite for identification as a case-patient. In light of this conflict between clinical necessity and study purity, estimates of the size of the association between exposure to sick poultry and H5N1 infection could be interpreted as maximums that are likely to have been inflated by this selection bias.",

A standardized questionnaire and trained interviewing staff were used to try to minimize interviewer bias, but masking the interviewers as to the case or control status of the respondents was not possible. Recall bias was likely to have occurred, especially because the high case-fatality rate meant that a larger proportion of interviews in the case group (26/28) than the control group (35/106) were completed by proxies. The substantial delay between onset of illness and interviews (mean 35.7 days) is also a potential source of recall bias.",

Although this study cannot estimate the absolute risk, among those who prepared sick or dead poultry for consumption, a high proportion of infections could be attributed to this practice. However, as the practice was not that widespread in our study participants, stopping it would prevent only an estimated 28% of H5N1 cases. Less risky but more widespread practices probably account for a greater proportion of H5N1 cases; these practices must also be identified and tackled. Regardless whether consumption of infected poultry is itself a risk factor, preparation and consumption of sick or dead poultry in infected areas must stop. That all 106 persons selected as control-respondents from communities with at least 1 confirmed human H5N1 case were negative for H5N1 antibodies adds further evidence to the belief that widespread subclinical H5N1 infection has not yet occurred in Southeast Asia (20).",

Despite 2 reports of exposure to potentially contaminated water in Vietnamese H5N1 case-patients ([21]; pers. comm., Ministry of Health, Vietnam), no human cases of H5N1 infection have been directly attributed to exposure to contaminated water. Nevertheless, hygiene practices and access to safe water have collateral benefits regardless of H5N1 and should be encouraged and pursued.

Although common exposures and behavior may be one explanation for the marked clustering, most clusters have involved blood relatives such as sibling pairs or parent-child groups rather than unrelated pairs such as husbands and wives. This finding suggests that inherited biologic factors, such as sialic acid receptor phenotype or immune response, may be determinants of infection and disease. Studying intrinsic determinants of susceptibility will require pooling of data and samples from affected families across affected countries. If intrinsic susceptibility were a risk determinant, it might dilute associations between certain behavior and infection unless the analyses were undertaken within subgroups that are homogeneous with respect to their intrinsic susceptibility. In this respect, intrafamilial studies that combine measures of biologic susceptibility with data about behavioral patterns, including food consumption and hygiene practices, may be particularly enlightening.",
