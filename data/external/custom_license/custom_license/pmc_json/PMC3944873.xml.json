One of the sides of each pen was able to be moved in toward the horse on a ratchet mechanism, allowing staff close access to the horses, as required, over the side of the pen without the need for them to enter the pen itself (13). Room temperature was maintained at 22\u00b0C with 15 air changes/h; humidity ranged from 40% to 60%. Horses were fed a mixture of lucerne (alfalfa) and grass hay, concentrates, and specified fruit and vegetables. On the day before HeV exposure, an indwelling jugular catheter was sutured in position, and an intrauterine temperature data-logger was placed into each horse. All vaccinated horses were euthanized electively on day 7, 8, or 9 after challenge; unvaccinated horses were euthanized upon reaching a predetermined humane endpoint (6\u20139 days after vaccination). The humane end point was defined as fever for up to 48 h accompanied by increased respiratory rate, dyspnea, depression, ataxia, or pressing the head against the side of the stall. Euthanasia was conducted by intravenous injection of a barbiturate following sedation with intravenous detomidine and butorphanol.",

Vaccines for initial efficacy studies in target species were formulated with 50 \u03bcg or 100 \u03bcg of affinity-purified sG glycoprotein. All subsequent vaccines were formulated with clarified CHO cell culture supernatant that was then gamma irradiated. The change of the expression system from 293F cells to CHO cells was driven by the need for higher antigen yields, and equivalence was supported by laboratory analysis of the expressed antigens from the 2 systems and a comparison study in ferrets. Vaccine formulations used in efficacy studies are summarized in Table 1.",

Horses V8\u2013V10 were selected from 29 vaccinated horses in a larger field efficacy and safety study on the basis of temperament and for having the lowest serum neutralization titers in the group at the time. Overall, 4 efficacy tests were completed; 2 vaccinated horses were used in the first test, 3 were used in the second, 2 were used in the third, and 3 were used in the fourth. For the 4 tests, a pathogenicity control for the inoculum was provided by 1 horse (test 1), 4 guinea pigs (test 2), 2 ferrets (test 3), and 2 ferrets (test 4). Guinea pigs and ferrets each received 50,000 50% tissue culture infectious doses of the same virus preparation that was used in the horses; guinea pigs received the dose by intraperitoneal injection, and ferrets received the dose by the oronasal route. Experience has shown that these doses and routes of administration were expected to be lethal in >25% of guinea pigs and 100% of ferrets. Exposure conditions for 3 additional unvaccinated control horses were equivalent to those used in both vaccinated horses and the inoculum-control horse and have been described (6).",

Similar results were obtained for 2 of 3 horses exposed to HeV 6 months after vaccination. In the third horse, which also remained clinically healthy, evidence of HeV replication was limited to low-level transient detection of viral genome (but not virus) from the nasal cavity. In assessing the field significance of this observation, the following must be noted: the experimental horses were exposed to considerably higher levels of HeV than have been recovered from flying foxes (1), higher levels of viral genome were routinely found in the nasal secretions of nonimmunized horses, and all human infections have been acquired from animals in which clinical disease developed. It is reasonable to suggest that the higher transmission risk that is clearly associated with such horses is a consequence of not only increased viral load but also of the illness itself: it is the clinically ill horse that promotes increased human\u2013animal contact through diagnostic investigations and administration of nursing care. We conclude that the level and pattern of virus replication in the 1 vaccinated horse do not meet the epidemiologic criteria presently associated with transmission of infection to humans.",

However, we caution that any correlation between antibody titer at the time of exposure to virus and levels of subsequent protection against infection and disease is unlikely to be linear; it is possible that animals with even lower titers will have epidemiologically meaningful protection against HeV exposure occurring in the field, not least because of stimulation of immunological memory. Additional studies assessing the duration of protection are planned, and the outcome of these will further inform recommendations regarding booster vaccination.",

In other regions where HeV infection of horses has not been reported, there is understandably more uncertainty regarding the value of vaccination as part of horse preventative health programs. Any reluctance to vaccinate horses against HeV that is based on assessment of risk is probably exacerbated by several factors, including the novelty of the vaccine roll-out process to the Australian horse industry, a (mistaken) perception that fast-tracking vaccine release involved overlooking key safety and efficacy issues, the lack of published data on safety in pregnant mares, reluctance of certain industry sectors to vaccinate because of import restrictions on HeV-seropositive horses, and cost. Although it is likely that each of these barriers will diminish over time, our experiences may assist the development of road maps to guide the future release of vaccines against BSL-4 pathogens that are associated with highly sporadic disease events and where the decision to vaccinate is in the hands of the persons whom vaccination was designed to protect.",

At the same time, the vaccine is expected to provide a substantial health benefit to humans. In so doing, this vaccine encapsulates the spirit of a One Health approach, not just in terms of the interconnectedness of human and animal health but also with respect to environmental health. One consequence of the recent HeV outbreaks was a move to eradicate bat populations, despite their crucial environmental roles in pollination and reduction of the insect population. Successful deployment of the HeV vaccine, with a targeted reduction in the risk for acute disease events in horses and humans, should help reduce the current momentum toward the setting of control policies with potential adverse effects on the environment. Furthermore, the increasing evidence for henipaviruses and henipa-like viruses in bats in other areas (30\u201332) raises the possibility of future henipavirus outbreaks.
