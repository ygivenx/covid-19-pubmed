The dysfunction of epithelial electrolyte transport causes the production of viscous secretion by all exocrine glands. Due to the viscous mucus in the CF patients\u2019 airways, recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory tract commonly occur which play a crucial role in the progression of the disease. The colonization of the lung with bacteria, predominantly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is thought to be the main cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. In the course of the CF disease, fungal colonization of the airways and respiratory infections play an increasing role, especially due to rising awareness of fungal growth in microbiological diagnostic, a longer life expectancy and a rising percentage of immunocompromised CF patients.",

The adult population of patients has been steadily increasing, and in some countries it has now numerically passed the pediatric population. New treatments are available, including mutation-specific therapies that might have the potential to change the natural history of the disease [1, 2]. More emphasis is given to clinical research, and a network of European CF centers has been established with the aim of facilitating high-quality clinical trials to translate new therapies into clinical care. Epidemiological data from many European countries have become available through the EuroCareCF project [3] and national and international registries. Evidence of disparities in allocation of resources and in clinical outcomes has also emerged.",

Data obtained from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry revealed forecasts for 2025 in 16 European countries that are on one side promising and on the other side dramatic. The data indicated that the number of CF patients will increase by approximately 50%, mainly due to neonatal screening programs. Moreover, the number of CF adults will increase by approximately 75%, a finding that mostly results from the transition of children to adults, whereas the number of CF children will show a 20% increase. These results are crucial as people with CF have complex care needs that demand specialist with medical and allied healthcare expertise. The life expectancy has increased significantly in successive patient birth cohorts [5] as a result of more effective treatments and crucially because most patients attend CF centers in line with the demonstration that patients attending CF centers for their care have better well-being and lung function than those who do not [6, 7].",

In particular, he needs to be aware of the role of unusual microorganisms, the risk of cross-infection and the impact of long-term chronic infection on microbiological laboratory testing and anti-infective treatment.
