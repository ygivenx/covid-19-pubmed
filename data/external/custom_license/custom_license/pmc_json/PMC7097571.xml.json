Sample sizes were based on the availability of common marmosets. Necropsies of the six common marmosets were scheduled for 3 days post infection (d.p.i.). The common marmosets were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease and scored using a clinical scoring system prepared for common marmosets as described22 (see Supplementary Section \u2018Berlin definition of ARDS\u2019). On 1 and 3 d.p.i., clinical examinations and X-rays were performed on anaesthetized animals. The organs were collected on necropsy for experimental assays as described in ref. 21. No randomization or blinding was done in this study.",

Infections of all dishes of cells were performed simultaneously using a master mix of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV to minimize variation. At the indicated time points, total RNAs of the infected cells were collected. The altered gene expression following MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection at different time points were then compared with those at time point zero. The samples from time point zero were subjected to the corresponding virus inoculation, then immediately washed and immediately harvested to ensure that the detected gene alteration was not due to the virus inoculation process. The sequencing libraries were prepared at the Centre for Genomic Sciences at the University of Hong Kong using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and were subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Briefly, mRNA was isolated using polyT oligo-attached magnetic beads. The purified mRNA was fragmented and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) to first-strand cDNA in the presence of random hexamers. Double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by second strand synthesis and then subjected to end repair, 3\u2032 adenylation and indexed adaptor ligation.

Candidate genes from a defined disease pathway (renal necrosis/cell death) that possessed the following criteria were selected for further analyses: (1) the absolute gene expression level should be markedly induced; (2) the trend of gene expression should be consistent throughout the course of infection; (3) the tissue-specificity of the identified genes should not be restricted only to lung, but should be expressed in kidney; (4) a differential response of the gene expression pattern should be observed when infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, separately.",
