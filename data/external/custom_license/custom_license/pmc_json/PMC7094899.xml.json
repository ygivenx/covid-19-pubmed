Labs that work with them must follow strict security measures. But some researchers are unhappy with the register, pointing out that relatively innocuous pathogens, such as the fungus Coccidioides immitis, are placed under the same tight restrictions as lethal viruses such as smallpox. \u201cThe list is very arbitrary,\u201d says microbiologist Arturo Casadevall of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.",

Their formula considers a pathogen's virulence, ability to jump from person to person, incubation period and capacity to remain in the environment. The CDC's list takes similar factors into account, but not in a quantitative fashion.",
