Her ability to encourage numerous experts and societies to work together and get involved in \u201cchild sizing the amount of radiation used\u201d has resulted in a groundswell of research and activity in this area. Currently 69 organizations with over 800,000 members have joined the Alliance including 24 international societies. The web site, www.imagegently.org, has been immensely successful filled with free information pamphlets in over 12 languages, PQI projects, and modules for parents, physicians, and technologists. The Image Gently Campaign has received several awards including the Associations Advance America Honor Roll, RT Image magazine group with the \u201cmost influence in radiology\u201d and the Most Effective Philanthropy Program from Aunt Minnie. Image Gently has spawned the creation of the adult-focused Image Wisely campaign. The Alliance has been named by the Joint Commission, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the American Medical Association in their influential statements on radiation dose as providing much needed guidance and information. Marilyn\u2019s exceptional talent is inspiring and coordinating experts in multiple fields to work together towards common goals.

This has been a resounding success, is currently used in other categories during RSNA and is a model for other meetings, including the Annual Meeting for the Society for Pediatric Radiology over the past few years. Pediatric Radiology was first in this effort. George continued to endorse topics which were marquees for Pediatric Radiology over the year in his education role on the RSNA Board of Directors. He endorsed and implemented the Pediatric Campus concept at the 2011 RSNA. Early returns are that this was an extremely successful model to consolidate experts in pediatric radiology (and those interested in this subspecialty), pertinent science, education and administration.

Initially, Dr. D thought he would become a pediatric surgeon; but after passing the Part I examination offered by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, he changed his mind and began his training in diagnostic radiology. He chose a radiology residency at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, in Sydney, Australia. This included a year in pediatric radiology at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in Sydney where his interest and love of pediatric radiology began. Dr. D then had the foresight to pursue pediatric radiology fellowship training at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. After completing the fellowship, he was immediately offered a position as staff radiologist at \u201cSick Kids\u201d. He became Director of Body Imaging in 1984 and Radiologist-in-Chief in 1988 serving in that capacity for 7 years. His management style was simple but effective. He chose staff that were young, but smart and innovative. He nurtured them and provided them with all the tools they needed to become successful professionals, like him. But contributing to his own department was not enough for him. He also found the time and strength to contribute, teach, train, and help pediatric radiologists in the most remote portions of the globe in every continent, which resulted in recognition from prestigious organizations in places such as South America, Israel, Europe, Taiwan and Australia: he is an Honorary member of the European Society for Pediatric Radiology and the Sociedad Latinoamericana de Radiologia Pediatrica as well as other national societies.",

His teaching is unique and praiseworthy in being enthusiastic, provocative, and fun at the same time. His lectures have been regarded as both instructive and practical by his students and trainees due to his special gift of making the most complicated things look as simple as possible. In sharing his diagnostic knowledge and know-how, he passes his own, innate teaching spirit on to his apprentices. He has earned several awards for this, including the outstanding teacher award granted by the University of Toronto fellows at Sick Kids for the past 5 consecutive years. Dr. D receives numerous invitations to present at national and international meetings and symposia and has been invited as a visiting professor to more than a hundred institutions across the globe. He does not only teach us the ins and outs of Pediatric Radiology, but he makes sure that we learn to love it and understand the importance not only of good practice but also the imperative to pass knowledge on by teaching and publishing. Dr. D is someone who inspires us to reach beyond our limits, someone we want to emulate. He shares his knowledge, his wisdom, and his advice freely. He shares with us the most incredible secrets of his own career, so we understand from his personal experience. Dr. D never tells you what to do, he suggests to you, in an incredible articulate fashion, what you want to do yourself. Dr. D has been and is for many of us, more than an educator, more than a mentor, he is our \u201ccoach\u201d. Well before this concept was introduced into medicine by A. Gawande1, Dr. D intuitively had the vision to \u201ccoach\u201d his trainees, trying to get the best out of them, without pressure, but with love and passion, and especially emphasizing the importance of achieving a work-life balance in order to prevent the now so common \u201cstress and burnout\u201d affecting the radiology community2. He warned us that many high achievers reach their goals only at the expense of their personal lives, but Dr. D has been as successful personally as he is professionally. His wonderful wife of 40 years, Louise, his two daughters and his recently newborn granddaughter serve as sources of strength and pride. He is a truthful and generous friend to many, both in and out of radiology. It is not uncommon for many of us, who came through Sick Kids, to come back and visit and be invited to his house to share a wonderful dinner with other invitees, who may be radiologists from North America or from other parts of the globe visiting Sick Kids to learn from him.",

Dr. Caffey in 1946 first recognized the telltale radiographic changes that characterize the battered child, and his students helped disseminate his teachings about these findings.

Affected infants typically present with clinical syndromes characterized by dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles, and hypoxemia. Mainly due to a lack of evidence based information regarding underlying pathogenesis, natural history, imaging findings, and histopathologic features of interstitial lung disease, the understanding of interstitial lung disease in infants has been limited in the past. However, in recent years, the understanding of interstitial lung disease in infants has been substantially improved primarily due to: 1) advances in imaging technology for better detection; 2) improvement of thoracoscopic techniques for lung biopsy; 3) established pathologic criteria for consistent diagnosis; and 4) development of new classification system based on underlying etiology of the interstitial lung disease. In fact, several forms of interstitial lung disease in infants that exhibit distinct clinical, radiological, and pathological patterns are currently emerging. The overarching goal of this article is to review a new classification system, imaging findings, and pathological correlation of interstitial lung disease in infants. Improved understanding of this often challenging disorder can aid in early and accurate diagnosis, which in turn, will result in improved patient care.",

This lecture will focus on the main principles of volumetric CT imaging that apply generically to all MDCT scanners and in particular we describe the reconstruction techniques for imaging the pediatric thorax and the low-dose protocols used in our institution on a 64-slice dual source CT scanner. Examples of important clinical applications with the impact and added value of post processing are also given.",

While conventional proton MRI has found widespread clinical application in most organs of the body, MRI of the lung lags behind because the lung is intrinsically difficult to image with MRI. The strength of the MR signal depends on the physical density of protons in the tissue being imaged and the local environment of the protons. The lung has a low physical density and thus a low proton density so little MR signal is generated by the lung. Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility effects from its many air-tissue interfaces cause what little signal is generated to rapidly decay so that the lung typically appears dark on conventional proton MR images. A variety of strategies have been developed to overcome the inherent difficulties of MRI of the lung, resulting in recent substantial improvements in image quality. Additionally by administering an inhaled gaseous contrast agent, such as the hyperpolarized noble gases helium-3 or xenon-129, direct visualization of lung airspaces in an MR image is possible. A number of unique strategies for evaluating the structure and function of the human lung using hyperpolarized gas MRI have been developed. Although the level of structure detail possible with lung MRI may never equal that of CT, MRI may nonetheless has the potential to provide clinically useful information and be a sensitive, effort independent test of pediatric lung disease.",

Radiologists engage in two interrelated processes when interpreting imaging studies: perception and analysis. Failures in perception (failure to identify an important finding) are a common source of diagnostic error in pediatric imaging, while failures in the analytic portion of the process (over- or faulty interpretation of a finding) are not as common. Under-interpretation of findings can be related to a number of perceptual and visual phenomena including visual isolation where attention is selectively focused on a main area of the image while less or no attention is given to secondary areas, and satisfaction of search which occurs when additional lesions remain undetected after detection of an initial lesion. Many analytic errors are the result of commonly used heuristics or shortcuts in reasoning. These include the availability heuristic in which likelihoods are based on memory of a similar case, the framing effect in which a different diagnosis is reached based on how the information is presented, and the anchoring heuristic in which the initial impression is difficult to change, despite conflicting new information. Another recognized pitfall is blind obedience, in which a diagnostician stops thinking when confronted by authority. This authority can be human or technical (reliance on a laboratory value). Finally, diagnostic errors can result from an attitude of overconfidence. Examples of these heuristics and strategies to minimize cognitive errors will be discussed.",

For physeal cartilage imaging, increased signal intensity on water sensitive images can reveal occult trauma. 3-D gradient recalled (GRE) images demonstrate areas of transphyseal bony bridging and MIP reconstructions allow axial mapping of the bridge and quantification of the percentage of physis involved. Epiphyseal cartilage destruction due to infection, and acute or chronic trauma is best depicted with T2-weighted images. Gadolinium enhanced imaging detects transphyseal vascularity, an important predictor of growth disturbance particularly in Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Infections limited to the epiphyseal cartilage in infants may also be best depicted after contrast administration. Articular cartilage loss is best seen on 3-D GRE images.",

Approximately two-thirds of these deaths occurred in children in Africa in 2008. The top five major infections that account for these African pediatric deaths include pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and diarrhea. Early and accurate diagnosis is important for proper management of children with these infectious diseases. Imaging evaluation plays an important role. However, there are currently many challenges in Africa which include: 1) lack of both basic and advanced imaging equipment and facilities; 2) insufficient number of dedicated pediatric radiologists; and 3) limited educational opportunities for radiologists interested in taking care of children.

When it occurs in the infants and young child, it usually develops idiopathically and reduced by the technique such as air enema under the fluoroscopic guidance or saline enema under the ultrasound guidance. The success rate of the non-surgical reduction has reported over 95%. The pneumatic reduction is to introduce air into the patients\u2019 rectum via a ballooned Foley catheter by hand pump. A mercury manometer connecting with the Foley catheter calibrates the pressure of insufflation, and the recommended maximum pressure is 120 mmHg. The hydrostatic reduction is to drip saline from a bag at the height of 3 ft that may be different according to the institute\u2019s guidelines. Until recently, in both techniques, the precise measurement of the intraluminal pressure was not possible. With the purpose of intraluminal pressure monitoring, we introduced a specific digital pressure gauge that can measure both pneumatic and hydrostatic pressure in various units and can give the collected data to our workstation. With the data, we purpose to make the curve of intraluminal pressure during the procedure and to compare the pattern and difference in both techniques of reduction, which permits suggesting the better technique for reducing the intussusception. From February 2011, we performed the intraluminal pressure monitoring in 8 children; 4 cases of pneumatic reduction and 4 cases hydrostatic reduction. The results indicated that the curves were similar in both techniques. However, the hydrostatic reduction tended to need longer time and higher pressure difference than the pneumatic reduction. We assumed that a higher flow rate and more fluctuating introduction of pressure in the pneumatic reduction made the difference between both methods.",

It is extremely sensitive to even minute amounts of paramagnetic substances and therefore for detection of blood products (hemosiderin, ferritin), deoxygenated blood, calcium, iron, and small vein depiction. It is particularly suited for vascular imaging, especially in cerebral ischemia. SWI has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting cerebral microbleeds than is conventional T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo imaging (GRE) partly because of its inherent sensitivity, increased spatial resolution and the thinner slices acquired. Recent studies have shown that SWI detected more microbleeds in more patients, irrespective of their location and that SWI may be more sensitive in detecting traumatic lesions than CT or MRI.",

Paired t-tests were used to identify significant differences in the respective arterial and venous flow rates.

The choice of coil and field of view varied according to the age and size of the patient. Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T magnet (Phillips MRI system). After the cine gradient echo time of flight sequences were acquired, the dynamic keyhole MR angiographic sequence was applied in the coronal orientation. This sequence commenced 2\u20135 s after initiation of the first bolus administration of 2\u201310 mL of undiluted gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.5 mmol/mL, Magnevist) at a rate of 2\u20133 mL/sec followed by 10\u201320 mL of saline at a rate of 2 mL/sec. Image acquisition was repeated multiple times without delay for 60 s during shallow breathing. Contrast material was administered through a peripheral or central venous line, and sometimes via simultaneous bilateral extremity injections. Rarely manual hand injection was performed. The parameters were as follows: CENTRA k-space filling, acquired voxel size 1\u20131.2 x 1\u20131.2 x 2\u20133, reconstructed voxel size 0.4-1 x 0.4-1 x 1\u20131.5, number of dynamics 8\u201320, keyhole percentage 25\u201338%, SENSE (parallel imaging) factor 2x1-2x2 ,dynamic times 1\u20133.6 s, and injection rate 1\u20133 cc/second.

While the liver is the dominant excess iron storage organ, iron related cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Therefore, accurate determination and tracking of tissue iron levels in both the liver and the myocardium is important for patient prognostication as well as monitoring treatment changes. While multi-echo gradient echo MRI (T2*) is widely used and validated method employed for iron assessment, less attention has been given to derived metrics. Specifically, the literature almost exclusively reports and uses the mean value for T2* from a pixel-wise (PW) map. Infrequently used is the median. The median is a potentially superior metric than the mean because it is insensitive to outliers. Outliers will always occur in data because of either noise or imperfect vessel exclusion.

The q-factors were adjusted according to patient size, age, and gender and then multiplied by the DLP to estimate the risk to each patient. This process was applied to the cohort of pediatric patients undergoing CT examination at our institution. To evaluate the impact of including patient size, age, and gender, risk estimates were obtained excluding and including the dependencies on size, age, and gender. The results were computed in units of cancer incidence per 1000 cases exposed (cpt).",

The fracture was on the left side in 7 cases and on the right side in 1 (the patient with bilateral fractures). In all of the fractures, there was lateral displacement of the femoral shaft. In 3 fractures, the femoral head was not yet ossified simulating the appearance of a dislocation. Location of the femoral head in the hip joint was verified by ultrasound or CT (CT abdomen had already been done in 1 patient) thus delineating the presence of a physeal fracture. 6/8 fractures were Salter-Harris I and the other 2 were Salter-Harris II fractures. The fracture was acute in 2 cases and subacute in 6 cases.

Eleven stents (diameters 6 to 12 mm) were placed in the trachea and one in the left main bronchus. Two stents had to be removed and replaced for technical reasons (one was too long and the other too narrow). The child with syndromic TBM died when treatment was withdrawn because she could not be weaned from the ventilator. The remaining children are alive at a median follow-up of nine months (range 1 to 17 months). The granulation tissue response was similar to that seen after placement of metal stents.

He had mild tachypnea without cyanosis. His oral intake was adequate with no evidence of failure to thrive. He was referred to a pediatric cardiologist who performed an ECG and a transthoracic echocardiogram. The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at 135 beats per minute with no abnormalities. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a 25 x 25 x 14 mm homogenous mass originating from the anterior free wall of the right ventricle, and mild dilation of the right ventricle. Mild dynamic subpulmonary stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect were also noted. Although the murmur was significantly louder at one month follow-up, a repeat echocardiogram did not reveal any increase in the size of the mass. At 2 months of age, a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) study under general anesthesia was performed. CMRI revealed a 16 x 21 x 22 mm cardiac tumor that was causing narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract. The tumor was hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T1-weighted imaging, with positive delayed enhancement. These findings, along with the size and location of the mass, are consistent with a diagnosis of a cardiac fibroma. Chest MRA, that was also performed, showed normal extracardiac vascular anatomy with no evidence of peripheral branch pulmonary stenosis. Cardiac fibromas do not usually increase in size; however, the concern is the child\u2019s risk of arrhythmias. Frequent Holter monitoring was recommended for this patient. Considerations were also made for an electrophysiology study in the next 1\u20132 years to determine the risk of ventricular ectopy.

Because the classical triad of epilepsy, mental retardation and adenoma sebaceum is not commonly seen on clinical examination, imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberous sclerosis. Central nervous system features of TS include subependymal nodules, cortical tubers, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, white matter bands and cysts. In patients with TS, cerebral involvement in the form of subependymal nodules is seen in 95 to 100% and white matter abnormalities are noted in 40% to 90% of cases. Knowledge of expected radiological features is thus important in making the correct diagnosis. Recent studies have indicated that earlier appearance of brain lesions indicate a greater risk of mental retardation and a more severe clinical course. We present a case of a 23-day-old neonate who was referred to us with concerns for hydrocephalus. The cranial ultrasound demonstrated multiple echogenic subependymal nodules of varying sizes and mild asymmetry of the ventricles. The differential diagnosis included TS, TORCH infections, and X-linked subependymal heterotropia. Areas of increased echogenicity were noted within the white matter of the left frontal lobe, which favored TS. Subsequently, an MRI was performed to validate these findings and assess for additional white matter lesions. The MRI showed classic manifestations of TS that included periventricular lesions and streaky, linear, wedge-shaped hyperintensities on FLAIR imaging. A noncontrast CT scan was also performed which revealed classic calcified subependymal nodules. Cardiac rhabdomyoma and renal angiomyolipoma are the other recognized manifestations of TS and were respectively excluded by subsequent echocardiogram and renal ultrasound.",

Up to 55% of cases have associated anomalies, the most common of which is epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Prenatal findings have been reported sonographically for each of these anomalies, both in isolation and in the rare case of association. A case of isolated PA has been reported by fetal MRI. We present the first reported case of PA with EB diagnosed by fetal MRI with corroborative postnatal imaging and surgical findings. The mother of this child was initially referred to the Fetal Care Center of Cincinnati at 21 weeks gestation for a possible myelomeningocele diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound at an outside facility. These ultrasound images were not available for review at the time of our workup. A fetal MRI was the first study to be obtained at our institution. The MRI showed no myelomeningocele or brain anomalies. The stomach was moderately enlarged throughout the exam and did not empty. Subjective polyhydramnios was also noted. No duodenal dilation was seen, and there was minimal fluid in the distal bowel loops. This constellation of findings raised concern for pyloric atresia, resulting in a careful search for any sign of epidermolysis bullosa due to a known association of these disorders. Prominent debris was seen layering dependently in the amniotic fluid and in the dilated fetal stomach, and the external ears were abnormally small and misshapen. The PA-EB association was proposed as the underlying diagnosis based on our MRI findings. It was also postulated that skin blistering over the lumbosacral spine at the time of the prior outside ultrasound could have mimicked a myelomeningocele, thus prompting the referral to our center. At delivery, the baby had numerous skin defects, and the ears were malformed. An abdominal radiograph obtained after nasogastric tube placement and air injection showed no gas beyond the stomach. A pyloric ultrasound showed a distended stomach without a patent pyloric channel to the duodenal bulb, consistent with pyloric atresia. A skin biopsy confirmed epidermolysis bullosa, and the patient underwent a resection of the PA with gastroduodenostomy. The baby subsequently expired less than two weeks later, most likely due to sepsis based on wound cultures and autopsy results. Our case demonstrates the ability of fetal MRI to diagnose this rare condition and highlights the key imaging manifestations of the PA-EB association.

She was unstable to undergo an upper GI exam under fluoroscopy, therefore a limited contrast study was performed at bedside which was inconclusive for malrotation. Subsequent NICU radiographs showed changing position of the appendix filled with residual contrast, visiting all quadrants of the abdomen in a random pattern over a few day period. This confirmed our suspicion for malrotation. It is well know that in malrotation the position of the cecum can be variable, most commonly located in the right upper quadrant or left lower quadrant.

The diagnosis is made clinically with detection of a low GGT in the face of an elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. One of the 3 subtypes, Type 2, was shown in 2006 to be highly related to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The vast majority in children in this study developed HCC at less than 2 years of age. Radiological contribution to the management of these chronic liver disease patients is to perform surveillance imaging to detect HCC. Due to the rarity of this condition, almost no reports exist in the radiological literature describing the imaging features or management of this condition.

However, over the last decade with advancement in imaging, several distinctive imaging features specific to renal tumors have been recognized which aid in their classification as being distinct pathologically. We present a case of Rhabdoid Tumor where in the primary tumor arose from the kidney. It had classical imaging features of Wilms tumor. We want to highlight that even with the most sophisticated imaging techniques, specific renal tumors cannot always be diagnosed with preoperative imaging and how this alters the management and prognosis for child with a renal mass. In our case, the postoperative findings, pathology and immunohistochemical techniques confirmed a Rhabdoid Tumor. Differentiation of these two tumors is essential since in patients with Rhabdoid Tumor survival is poor with 4-year overall survival rates of 42% for stages I and II and 16% for stages III, IV, and V. On imaging, there are several features that suggest the diagnosis of rhaboid tumor. These include subcapsular fluid collections, linear calcifications outlining tumor lobules, and vascular invasion. Also, a pertinent feature of rhabdoid tumor due to its aggressive nature is the presence of lung metastasis (83%) and synchronous malignant brain lesions (15%). These findings were not present on our case, which led us in formulating a diagnosis of Wilms. Our patient is unusual in the fact that the local renal findings and absence of metastasis, synchronous malignant lesions, and vascular invasion led us to an incorrect diagnosis of Wilms tumor. In conclusion, we would like to stress that diagnosis of rhabdoid tumor of the kidney on imaging presents a challenge because of its imaging similarity to Wilms tumor.",

During the procedure the retention anchor suture thread snapped and the metallic portion of the suture remained within the stomach. Day1 post procedure, the child became uncomfortable, so a gastrostomy tube check was performed. The suture was not visible in the abdomen on abdominal x-ray or fluoroscopically. On close review of the images, the suture was found projected over the distal esophagus. Initial impression was the anchor suture had refluxed into the esopahgeal lumen. Careful attempts were made to remove it along with the nasogastric tube, from above under fluoroscopic control. However on withdrawal of the nastogastric tube, the retention anchor suture moved enbloc with the nasogastric tube.

Our case is rare in the regards that the tumor occurred in an uncommon retroperitoneal location in a pediatric patient and was mimicking a retroperitoneal hematoma which posed a significant diagnostic challenge.

MRI has a great role in the pediatric population owing to its inherent advantages namely lack of radiation, high tissue specificity, and high diagnostic yield at the level of the entire body under a single sedation. Unlike the application of WBMRI in the assessment of metastasis and bone marrow involvement in leukemia, its role in systemic diseases is yet to be further investigated. Certain diseases such as CRMO are very often multifocal. The extent of osteonecrosis in patients on steroids, dermatomyositis and the lesions related to child abuse are very often wide spread in the skeleton. We intend to present some of the findings of these pediatric systemic and multifocal diseases on WBMRI. Chronic Relapsing Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO): CRMO can be acute or chronic and is multifocal. The abnormality manifests as high signal intensity. WBMRI can guide for the best site for biopsy and provides monitoring for response to treatment. Osteonecrosis: Only few small studies evaluated the usefulness of WBMRI in the diagnosis of both the symptomatic and asymptomatic sites of osteonecrosis in ALL patients on steroid therapy. WBMRI is more sensitive than conventional radiographs. The abnormalities are typically geographical areas of high STIR signal intensity. Myopathies: WBMRI has also the role of detecting the extent of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis in the entire skeleton. Child abuse: WBMRI has a low sensitivity for the highly specific fractures that are pathognomonic for child abuse.",

Hemihydranencephaly is an extremely rare brain condition in which the vascular anomaly is unilateral, with fewer than 10 cases previously reported in the literature. This is a case of a 4 month old male who presented to the ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible leukocoria of the right eye. The patient had a history of a difficult vaginal delivery that required forceps delivery with possible associated trauma to the right eye. Dilated fundoscopic exam revealed retinal calcifications. This caused a clinical concern for retinoblastoma and CT and MRI of the orbits were obtained. CT demonstrated profound dilatation of the left lateral ventricle with only a thin rim of cortex surrounding it. There was some midline shift to the right with mild dilatation of the right lateral ventricle. The thalami and brainstem were spared. There were multiple soft tissue bodies that layered in the dependent portion of the left lateral ventricle, which were isodense to grey matter. MRI revealed similar findings consistent with hemihydranencephaly involving the left cerebral hemisphere. There were multiple round soft tissue masses that measured up to 1 cm in size that layered posteriorly in the left lateral ventricle. These masses were isointense to grey matter on T2 and hyperintense on T1. When the patient was placed with his head turned to the left, these masses moved to the dependent portion of the left lateral ventricle. The orbits were normal on both CT and MR. These soft tissue collections are presumed to be mobile collections of infarcted brain tissue. This unusual appearance has not been described in the radiology literature.

In the classic form, the newborn presents with poor feeding, vomiting, progressive lethargy and signs of increasing intracranial pressure 3\u20137 days after birth, rapidly progressing to apnea, coma and death if left untreated. We present a case of a term infant who presented to the hospital on the 5th day of life with a typical history of poor feeding and profound hypotonia. Upon admission he had multiple episodes of apnea and hemodynamic instability prompting intubation and intensive support. Laboratory evaluation revealed multiple abnormalities, most notably, hyperammonemia (910umol/L) and elevated citrulline (>800umol/L). MRI of the brain performed on the 7th day of life showed findings consistent with term hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy with restricted diffusion in bilateral rolandic cortex and subcortical white matter, bilateral caudate heads and lenticular nuclei, bilateral insular cortex, and bilateral cerebral peduncles. The genu of the corpus callosum, bilateral deep frontal white matter, and the left parietal white matter also demonstrated restricted diffusion suggesting infarction secondary to thrombosis of deep intramedullary veins. An area of restricted diffusion in the right parietal cortex was suspicious for superficial venous infarct. Review of the literature reveals that this case of neonatal citrillunemia has unique MRI findings. While our patient had diffusion changes with some shared similarities to the previous two cases in the literature, there are also findings consistent with deep intramedullary venous thrombosis and infarction.",

Only a few cases have been previously described in literature. We describe an extremely rare case of duplicated right internal auditory canal in a six month-old patient with a history of Down syndrome. A six month-old male with Trisomy 21 presented with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The patient failed the newborn hearing screening tests. Past medical history was unremarkable for recurrent ear infections. On focused physical examination, the auricles were normal appearing. External auditory canals were patent bilaterally revealing clear and translucent tympanic membranes. Patient did not reveal a facial palsy. Subsequently, a high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the temporal bone was performed. Duplicated appearance of the right internal auditory canal with separation of facial and vestibulocochlear segments was noted. The facial nerve canal demonstrated normal caliber while there was significant narrowing of the cochlear canal near the fundus. Significant stenosis of the vestibulocochlear segment of the duplicated IAC was identified at the porus acousticus. Dehiscent right posterior semicircular canal was also seen. An enlarged right vestibule was also noted. A single IAC was identified on the contralateral side with significant stenosis at the porus acousticus. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of IAC was recommended which revealed normal appearance of the bilateral cochlear and vestibular nerves. Duplication of the IAC is an extremely rare anomaly involving a redundant osseous canal extending from the cerebellopontine angle through the otic capsule bone toward the labyrinth or cochlea. A duplicated IAC may or may not be associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss secondary to aplasia or hypoplasia of the vestibulocochlear nerve. To evaluate for structural abnormalities that may preclude cochlear implantation, it is important to evaluate pediatric patients with sensorineural hearing loss radiologically. Although HRCT is the best imaging modality for evaluation of osseous IAC, the IAC contents are best viewed on MRI in oblique sagittal planes of the IAC using a 3-D volumetric steady state sequence.",

We present a case of a 5 year-old male who initially presented with persistent daily headaches. Physical exam including a detailed neurologic exam was within normal limits. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the brain was initially performed, demonstrating no abnormalities. Further work-up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed a well-defined, extra-axial mass superior to the cerebellum and inferior to the tentorium, immediately beneath the vein of Galen. The mass was iso-intense to grey matter on T1 and T2 sequences and there was no significant enhancement on post-contrast images. There was mass effect on the vermis and the cerebellar tonsils were displaced 3 mm below the foramen magnum. Neurosurgery was consulted and the mass was removed for diagnosis and treatment of the patient\u2019s symptoms. The mass was easily identified intra-operatively and gross total resection was accomplished successfully. Pathologic analysis of the mass revealed well-formed cerebellar tissue without evidence of neoplasia. To the best of our knowledge this is the only case of ectopic cerebellum presenting as a discrete extra-axial mass in the posterior cranial fossa. Our case shows that an extra-axial mass that parallels grey matter on all sequences can be a presentation of ectopic cerebellum.

An acute SDH is traditionally described as hyperdense and then becoming isodense in approximately 3 weeks when entering the subacute phase. In this report, we document the case of a pediatric patient with the new appearance of an acute SDH within 40 h of the prior CT that was isodense. Greater than 95% of the collection was isodense, with a small focus of hyperdensity. Acute SDHs are known to be isodense to gray matter in patients with anemia (WP Smith, Am J Neurorad 1981). However, the hemoglobin and hematocrit was within normal limits. In addition, acute SDHs that are only a few hours old can have a mixed hyperdense and hypodense appearance because of uncoagulated blood before clotting takes place (J Provenzale, AJR 2007). Thus, an acute SDH can have an isodense appearance in a non-anemic patient. Radiologists should consider the possibility of an acute SDH with an isodense appearance, especially in case of possible non-accidental trauma where timing of an injury is important.",

The occurrence of these lesions in the esophagus is limited to a collection of case reports in the available literature. Most esophageal mesenchymal tumors in the pediatric GI tract are benign leiomyomas. The vast majority of malignant mesenchymal tumors in children are categorized as either sarcomas or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). We report a case of a high grade undifferentiated sarcoma of the distal esophagus in an 11-year-old male. While this tumor most closely resembles a GIST, the immunohistochemical profile of the lesion is not typical of any distinct mesenchymal neoplasm. A review of the literature demonstrates a single case report of a likely benign undifferentiated mesenchymal neoplasm of the distal esophagus in an adolescent. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an undifferentiated esophageal sarcoma in a pediatric patient. We provide radiologic and pathologic features of the above lesion, and review the typical imaging and pathologic characteristics of mesenchymal GI neoplasms.",

It has been shown that a variety of health care professionals other than anethesiologists may provide sedation, including advanced practice registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, fellow level trainees, emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, pediatricians and, last but not least, radiologists. Moderate sedation, also called \u201cconscious sedation\u201d, does generally not require an anesthesiologist as there is usually adequate spontaneous ventilation and no airway intervention required. However, in case of a complication during the imaging study intubation may become necessary. For patients with certain congenital or acquired conditions emergent intubation may be very difficult and should be brought to the attention of an anesthesiologist prior to inducing moderate sedation. The four \u201cD\u2019s\u201d is a quick way to assess potentially difficult airways that necessitate consultation with anesthesia prior to moderate sedation: Dentition (incisor/tooth size, dental alignment, and macroglossia), Distortion (swelling from infection, tumor, or trauma), Disproportion (hyoid-chin ratio, such as with micrognathia), and Dysmobility (jaw or cervical spine movement issues, i.e. trauma or atlanto-occipital instability).

High intestinal obstruction is suspected when only few dilated loops are identified, while multiple dilated bowel loops are seen in low obstruction. Most cases of high obstruction may not need another diagnostic imaging test. All cases of distal intestinal obstruction require water soluble enema to identify the etiology of obstruction. In conditions like functional immaturity of the colon, and meconium ileus water soluble enema is therapeutic and thus surgery can be avoided in most cases.

Menstrual abnormalities may represent a more typical presentation in the adolescent age group. This is in contrast to the adult population, which may be more likely to present with infertility. The variation in clinical presentations make Mullerian duct anomalies difficult to diagnose and, because surgical techniques for correction and treatment depend on the underlying anatomy, understanding these variants in the context of imaging studies is important to their diagnosis and management.",

The major disadvantage of ultrasound is operator dependency, which is particularly evident in musculoskeletal applications.

Many imaging studies can be used to evaluate the bones and soft tissues, but conventional radiography is the primary imaging modality for most clinical conditions. Plain radiographs usually are obtained first because they are sensitive and specific for a wide range of bone pathology. More sophisticated imaging modalities including radionuclide scintigraphy (bone scan), ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are reserved for specific clinical situations. Each of these imaging modalities has specific advantages and disadvantages.

The tumor is composed of a nidus of vascular osteoid tissue and woven bone lined by osteoblasts, frequently with considerable surrounding inflammation. The radiolucent nidus surrounded by variable degrees of reactive sclerosis usually leads to a straightforward diagnosis; however, sometimes the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma can be challenging, as it may have a non-specific and misleading appearance on different imaging modalities, particularly on MRI. The purpose of this exhibit is to review the typical and atypical features of osteoid osteomas on different imaging modalities.

The recently described \u201cCT vessel\u201d or \u201cvascular groove\u201d sign, a low density vascular groove adjacent to the nidus, is highly specific for osteoid osteoma. In the authors\u2019 experience, a rim of sclerosis surrounding the nidus may aid in diagnosis on MRI and can be identified as an outer hypointense halo on all sequences. We illustrate the findings in cases of atypical osteoid osteomas which may be difficult to diagnose including intraarticular, phalangeal, and vertebral osteoid osteomas.

In general, ultrasound has a somewhat more limited role for the primary evaluation of several other pediatric musculoskeletal disorders in the setting of trauma, articular and periarticular diseases and tumors and tumor-like conditions. Inherent advantages of ultrasound include excellent spatial resolution, a lack of ionizing radiation, a relatively non-invasive technique and lack of a need for sedation. Real-time imaging allows problem solving not available with other modalities which is well suited for musculoskeletal applications, particularly in the setting of trauma. The major disadvantage of ultrasound is operator dependency, which is particularly evident in musculoskeletal applications. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the practical use of ultrasound in the evaluation of the distal lower extremity (knee to ankle) emphasizing the sonographic appearance of various musculoskeletal disorders. Examples include: 1) Cystic lesions around the joints: Baker\u2019s cyst, synovial cyst, ganglion cyst and suprapatellar bursitis; 2.

Due to the strength of the patella tendon, trauma to the anterior knee is often manifested by avulsive injuries, which may occur on an acute or chronic repetitive basis. Purpose: This pictorial review will illustrate differentiating radiographic and MRI features of acute and chronic avulsive injuries of the pediatric knee. Outline: 1. Anatomy and physiology a. Discuss the anatomic differences of the pediatric and adult knee extensor mechanism b. Pathophysiology and biomechanical basis for chondro-osseous avulsion injuries versus tendon tears in the skeletally immature. 2. Inferior patellar pole avulsive injuries a. Illustrate radiographic and MRI examples of acute and healing inferior patellar sleeve fractures b. Illustrate radiographic and MRI examples of Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease at various stages of healing c. Differentiating features of acute inferior patellar sleeve fractures and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease. d. Orthopaedic management of patellar sleeve fractures and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease. 3. Tibial tuberosity avulsive injuries a. Illustrate radiographic and MRI examples of acute and healing tibial tuberosity avulsion injuries. b. Illustrate radiographic and MRI examples of Osgood-Schlatter disease. c. Differentiating features of acute tibial tuberosity avulsion fractures and Osgood-Schlatter disease d. Orthopaedic management of tibial tuberosity avulsion fractures and Osgood-Schlatter disease. Conclusion: Acute and chronic patellar tendon avulsive injuries are frequently seen in children and have characteristic imaging features. Understanding the biomechanical basis of these avulsive injuries and orthopaedic management is important for radiologic interpretation of relevant imaging findings and effective communication to the treating physician.",

MRI is a useful adjunct for assessment of associated intracranial anomalies and complications. Timely and appropriate imaging is essential to assess for potential complications of craniosynostosis which may include intracranial hypertension, anomalies of external and middle ear, hydrocephalus, chronic tonsillar herniation, cranial base deformity, impaired venous drainage, enlarged emissary foramina and veins and optic atrophy. On the otherhand, positional plagiocephaly should not be misinterpreted as craniosynostosis.

Asymmetric metabolism often correlates to structural abnormalities like cortical dysplasia. Metabolic activity often correlates with tumor aggressiveness or grade. FDG PET is commonly used to assess seizure and tumor metabolism. The lesser utilized amino acid PET tracers (C11 Methionine, FDOPA) show increasing value with lower grade tumors due to high tumor to normal tissue contrast. Literature is accumulating regarding C11 methionine (CMET) in the detection of lesions like cortical dysplasia and its ability to delineate low grade seizure related tumor lesions. Despite the established FDG and accumulating CMET literature, little information exists about the imaging seen with both in pediatrics. As these studies are increasingly viewed as part of fusion MRI images, there is more scrutiny of focal metabolism correlating with MRI findings and less interpretative reliance on abnormality based solely on asymmetry.",

Several classifications schemes have been proposed from a pure embryologic to an imaging-based approach using some essential findings such as the size of the posterior fossa, the presence of CSF collection or expansion of CSF space, and the size and morphology of the cerebellum. MR is the gold-standard for adequately access and characterize the posterior fossa structures.

The identification of cystic spinal cord lesions is relatively rare in the neonate. However, the etiology of these lesions can often be deduced or surmised based upon the location and the imaging appearance of the lesion. The most common cause of a cystic intramedullary spinal lesion is ventriculus terminalis, with a reported incidence of 2.6%. Additional lesions include transient dilatation of the central canal, filar cyst, syringohydromyelia, intramedullary arachnoid cyst, and myelomalacia related to in utero/birth trauma. Extremely rare etiologies in the neonate include epidermoid/dermoid, cavernous malformation, intranatal cystic infections etiologies, neuroepithelial cysts, and cystic neoplasms. Mimics include diastematamyelia, spinal lipomas, and intramedullary hematomas. Numerous imaging examples of these lesions are provided in the accompanying poster.",

PSC includes eight subtypes of AIS: (1) sickle cell disease, (2) cardioembolic disease, (3) Moya-Moya Syndrome, (4) cervical arterial dissection, (5) stenoocclusive cerebral arteriopathy, (6) other determined etiology, (7) multiple probable etiologies, and (8) undetermined etiology.

The etiologies of cerebral venous thrombosis related infarction would be discussed from an imaging perspective with a case-based approach with emphasis on MRV and SWI techniques. Finally, we will focus on hemorrhagic causes of childhood stroke such as vascular malformation, aneurysm, neurocutaneous disorders, coagulopathy, and a variety of other causes from an imaging standpoint.

Early diagnosis of GERD is essential in avoiding long-term sequelae such as growth delay, chronic lung disease, esophageal stricture, and esophagitis. Gastroesophageal reflux scintigraphy, a non-invasive imaging modality, has been applied for detection of GERD and gastric emptying in children over the past few decades. The radiation burden is considerably small given that a very low dose of radioactivity via a short half-life radioisotope like Technetium-99 m tagged to oral sulfur colloid is administered to a patient. This feature makes reflux scintigraphy especially attractive as the patient can be scanned for prolonged and delayed periods without increasing radiation dose permitting not only identification but also assessment of severity of GERD. Characterizing GERD severity is essential in determining how aggressive the pediatrician should be with therapy. Gastroesophageal reflux scintigraphy also allows a child to be fed their regular meal tagged to radiopharmaceutical without altering food taste. Qualitative and quantitative parameters like gastrointestinal transit and gastric emptying time can be measured, respectively. Scintigraphy is highly sensitive to low grade reflux making it very desirable for monitoring response to therapy. While scintigraphy like all other imaging modalities,has limitations, it continues to be an excellent technique for GERD identification and characterization as well as in monitoring response to GERD therapy.",

In fact, more than 3,450,000 bone scans were performed in the United States in 2005. In this poster we will review the current indications for planar bone imaging for the evaluation of non-malignant diseases in the pediatric population, such as Acute Osteomyelitis secondary to Salmonella Enterobacteriaceae and tubercle bacillus (TB), Chronic Osteomyelitis, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, Spondylolysis, Bone Infarcts in the setting of Sickle Cell Disease, Fractures (Occult/Stress), Ankylosing Spondylitis, Dermatomyositis and non-accidental trauma. The poster will also correlate planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging findings with appropriate additional imaging including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and plain film radiographs when clinically warranted and in keeping with the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle set forth by the American College of Radiology (ACR).",

Both patients initially presented with solitary tumors but later developed extensive metastatic disease. The suspected vascular malformation and the renal mesoblastic nephroma both had the 12:15 translocation The axillary mass consisted of a spindle cell lesion surrounded by a collagenous capsule, which likely represented a vascular aneurysm. The spindle cells were bland and mitotically active. Immunohistochemistry for vascular markers were negative. The diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma was made based on presence of ETV6 rearrangement by FISH. The renal tumor consisted of a highly mitotically active spindled and round cell tumor with focal necrosis and hemorrhage. Karyotype was complex and FISH showed an ETV6 rearrangement, consistent with mesoblastic nephroma. So the diagnosis of infantile fibrosarcoma for the axillary mass and mesoblastic nephroma have the common ground of the same genetic translocation. In both conditions surgical excision of the primary lesion is usually curative. Metastatic dissemination is rare. The mesoblastic nephroma later presented with extensive pulmonary metastases and the axillary infantile fibrosarcoma later presented with a gastrointestinal bleed and metastases to muscle, bowel, subcutaneous tissue and brain! This poster will present two very unusual pathologies and provide insight into the value of todays genetic testing.",

Cardiovascular system: Echocardiogram and cardiac MRI and CT are useful in evaluating congenital heart disease associated with Down syndrome. Respiratory system: Micrognathia with macroglossia and hypotonia predisposes patients to sleep apnea which can be evaluated with dynamic MRI. Chest CT demonstrates subpleural cysts which are characteristic of this syndrome. Gastrointestinal system: Fluoroscopy and/or radiographs are the mainstay in diagnosing many gastrointestinal disorders including duodenal atresia, malrotation, annular pancreas, imperforate anus, and Hirschsprung disease. Central nervous system: Choroid plexus cysts may be identified on prenatal ultrasound in a fetus with Down syndrome. Imaging is used in the evaluation of epilepsy, hearing loss and Alzheimer disease that is more common in these individuals. Musculoskeletal system: Multiple skeletal anomalies can be present in patients with Down syndrome. Radiographs are often used as the method of identifying and, if needed, following the anomalies.

In addition, the true extent of LM is often not apparent clinically. Given these considerations and the implications for proper management, imaging plays an important role in the assessment of LM. The purpose of this exhibit is to review the spectrum of radiographic, CT, sonographic, and MR imaging findings of a variety of LM presentations.",

In 1989 with the elucidation of the CFTR gene, there was an explosion of knowledge which included the range of mutations responsible for the disease and proposals as to mechanism of action of the mutation with respect to disease manifestations. This preceded the development of hypotheses regarding the relationship between genotype and phenotype and the attempt to utilize imaging modalities which could better assess disease activity as it related to functional status.

The ductus bump was first described in 1965 by Berdon et al as a transient physiologic mass in the chest in newborn infants. Some controversy remains as to the exact etiology and clinical significance. Although initially thought to represent a dilated ductus arteriosus, recently it has been suggested that it actually represents a ductus arteriosus aneurysm that spontaneously resolves. Others contend it represents dilation of the infundibulum of the closing ductus. Regardless of etiology, the time of discovery, location, and rapid resolution are characteristic of this entity. In this presentation we will review the radiographic and echocardiogram findings of the ductus bump, as well as discuss the differential diagnosis. The frontal radiographic findings are a round mass to the left of the vertebral spine projecting from the mediastinum near the aortic arch. This mass does not indent the esophagus and it cannot be seen on the lateral view. It is classically said to resolve within the first few days of life. The controversy regarding the etiology has also led to some disagreement involving the clinical significance and appropriate follow up, which will also be discussed. After reviewing this educational poster, the reader will have increased awareness and understanding of the suspected etiology, imaging findings and significance of the ductus bump.",

Abnormal signal intensity in the posterior limb of the internal capsule coexists with lesions in the basal ganglia and thalami have been associated with abnormal motor outcome.

Punctate calcifications are seen not only in the epiphyses but also in the paravertebral regions. Paravertebral puncta are commonly associated with defective ossifications in the cervical spine. The malformation of the cervical spine causes spinal canal stenosis and instability, which occasionally necessitate surgical intervention.

The trend of lower ADC may indicate low axonal diameter, as ADC has been shown to more strongly correlate with axonal diameter without the myelin sheath.

Of these 49 patients, 20 patients reported to have patent ductus arteriosus as the primary cause of tracheobronchial compression or narrowing. Approximately 41% of patients with airway compression in patients with congenital heart disease are secondary to an enlarged and/or tortuous patent ductus arteriosus. None of these cases were due to a vascular ring. Of these 20 patients, 10, 6, and 4 patients demonstrated to have mild, moderate, and severe airway compression respectively.",

With early interventions, the progression to hepatic fibrosis can be slowed, halted, and in some cases reversed. Liver biopsy has long been considered the gold standard for assessing the presence and degree of liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy has disadvantages, due to its potential sampling error, risk of complications, relatively high cost, intra- and inter-observer variability, and, in general, poor acceptance by pediatric patients and their parents. MR elastography (MRE) is a relatively new, non-invasive technique that provides a safe, rapid and cost-effective method for objectively evaluating of a wide variety of hepatic diseases by quantitative stiffness evaluation of the liver-parenchyma. The purpose of this exhibit is to review our clinical experience with this technique and illustrate the application of liver MRE in the pediatric population at our medical center.",
