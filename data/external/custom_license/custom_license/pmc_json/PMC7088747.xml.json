They have been accredited with a substantial role in the biochemistry, physiology and ecology of the plants. These secondary metabolites are acknowledged to provide a rich pool for exploring novel compounds that may be exploited commercially in various industries (Manach et al. 2013). Many of these compounds found in Licorice roots (Glycyrrhiza glabra/Glycyrrhiza uralensis) have received attention in the recent years owing to their multitude of biological activities (Asl and Hosseinzadeh 2008). The root extract has shown to possess anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-ulcer, anti-allergy (Park et al. 2004), and antiviral activity against various DNA and RNA viruses (Fiore et al. 2008), including human immunodeficiency virus (Ito et al. 1988) and coronavirus (Cinatl et al. 2003). Recently focus on the plant has escalated due to a triterpenoid saponin, glycyrrhizin, exhibiting potent anticancer activity in human (Zhang et al. 2009) and mice (Khan et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Since almost all the licorice root used in mercantile, is collected from wild resources, therefore, its high demand and low supply has invited establishing alternative systems for production in renewable resources. However, selection of highly productive lines and optimization of chemical and physical culture milieu of the cells for copious production is a prerequisite for the commercial application of these systems. It has been demonstrated that the biosynthetic activity of cultured cells can be enhanced by regulating various factors like environment (Ayabe et al. 1990), selecting hyper\u2013producing lines (Jiao et al. 2014; Mardamshin et al. 1994) precursor feeding (Yang et al. 2007a, 2010) and transformation method (Li et al. 2013). The expanding commercial importance of the plant based anti-cancer compound has kindled the researchers to look for their production in tissue culture system. Exploitation of the biosynthetic capabilities of different cell types under a defined set of parameters, would not only give higher yields of the desired compound but will also provide deeper insight into regulatory processes thereon. Various in vitro systems including callus, organ (Gupta et al. 2013), cell suspension (Yang et al. 2006, 2007b) root (Du et al. 2001) and shoot cultures (Kojoma et al. 2010), have been exploited and subjected to terpenoid and flavonoid investigations in the past. In-vitro culture based metabolite analyses have shown the presence of flavonoids, chalcones and isoflavonoids (Kobayashi et al. 1985). Flavonoids like formononetin, isoliquiritigenin, echinatin, glabridine (Man et al. 2012; Tamura and Oda 1996), liquiritigenin, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, 3\u2032-hydroxy formononetin have been reported from the in vitro culture lines of Glycyrrhiza species. A recent study on adventitious roots of G. uralensis revealed production of flavonoids at par with the intact plant (Wang et al. 2013). Similar results on flavonoid hyper-producing cultures were reported by (Man et al. 2013) in suspended cells of Glycyrrhiza. However, reports on oleanane-type triterpenoids (glycyrrhizin and glycyrritinic acid) are few and recent (Gupta et al. 2013; Shirazi et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2006). On the contrary, lupane type triterpenoids (betulinic acid) and soya saponins, have been found in most of the earlier studies pertaining to tissue culture raised plants (Hayashi et al. 1988), exhibiting metabolite distribution pattern in various organs of the in vitro plant (Hayashi et al. 1988). Literature survey revealed most of the studies on terpenoids and flavonoids detection in in vitro plant cultures remain restricted to few compounds (Hayashi et al. 1988; Yang et al. 2007b), restraining a comprehensive picture of the metabolite composition. Until now, only a single report on the chemical analysis of six flavonoids and two terpenoids in suspension cells of G. uralensis has been accounted (Man et al. 2013). Here we are reporting the simultaneous assessment of ten compounds-eight flavonoids (butin, quercetin, isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, glabridin, 4\u2032-O-methylglabridine, hispaglabridin A and hispaglabridin B) and two terpenoids (glycyrrhizin and 18\u03b1-glycyrritinic acid) in the licorice root and in vitro raised callus, organ culture and plantlets of G. glabra. Also, the in vitro cytotoxicity, against a panel of four human cancer cell lines, were evaluated for these samples. The present study broadens the concept to investigate the biosynthetic potential of in vitro raised G. glabra cultures.",

The metabolite spectrum of triterpenoids and flavonoids in the aerial and underground parts of plantlets were found to deviate significantly. The biologically active triterpenoid saponins (glycyrrhizin and 18-\u03b1 glycyrrhetinic acid) were not detected in the aerial part of the 4 months old in vitro raised plantlet (TC1). However, underground rhizome showed presence of (8.60 \u00b5g/mg) glycyrrhizin. Among the organ culture analyzed, roots originating from in vitro plantlets, axenic root cultures (TR1 & TR2), yellow stolons (TC3), brown stolons (TC4) and brown root callus (TR2 & H7), produced glycyrrhizin under in vitro conditions. The glycyrrhizin content in these morphogenetic lines varied widely between 0.15 and 13.35 \u00b5g/mg. Analysis of the organ cultures revealed that the mature brown stolons (4 weeks) had a better capacity to form glycyrrhizin (1.9 \u00b5g/mg) than the yellow/green immature (2 weeks) stolons (0.19 \u00b5g/mg). Similarly, older roots showed more glycyrrhizin content (0.37 \u00b5g/mg) than the younger cultures (0.15 \u00b5g/mg). Further observations exhibited root cultures grown in solid media, in isolation, produced least glycyrrhizin. It seems certain amount of maturation along with differentiation is required for glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Hayashi et al. (1988) had concluded similarly observing thickening of the roots and xylem tissues being tightly associated with glycyrrhizin accumulation (Hayashi et al. 1988). Literature has limited reports on glycyrrhizin production in cell cultures. Nevertheless, the results of the present study corroborated well with earlier studies on in vitro raised stolons of G. glabra (Gupta et al. 2013), G. uralensis (Kojoma et al. 2010), callus tissues (Wongwicha et al. 2008) and suspension cultures (Wang et al. 2013) in Glycyrrhiza species. The present study also detected glycyrrhitinic acid, aglycon of glycyrrhizin, in appreciable amount (4.6 \u00b5g/mg) in one of the axenic root culture (H2).\n",

The underground parts of the plantlet, however, had an appreciable amount of all the eight investigated flavonoids. The roots analyzed from mature plantlet (4 months old) had a moderate amount of all the investigated compounds, except quercetin and 18-\u03b1 glycyrrhetinic acid which were not detected in the younger culture (2 months) also. The underground parts of the plantlet showed an appreciable amount of glabridine (18.6 \u00b5g/mg) and 4\u2032-O-methylglabridine (16.5 \u00b5g/mg), other investigated flavonoids ranged between (0.3 \u00b5g/mg, quercetin to 6.8 \u00b5g/mg). Formononetin. Hispaglabridine B and glabridine showed interesting pattern of accumulation. Hispaglabridine B, which was present in the highest amount (62.6 \u00b5g/mg) in the aerial part, was appreciably lesser in quantity in the underground rhizome. While glabridine that was undetected in the aerial part was present in the maximum amount (18.6 \u00b5g/mg) in the underground rhizome of the in vitro raised cultures under investigation. The stolon cultures and the axenic root tissues detected good amounts of formononetin (2.9\u201310.3 \u00b5g/mg) and isoliquiritigenin (1.2\u20133.6 \u00b5g/mg), and moderate amounts of other flavonoids, except quercetin, which was not detected in any of the stages under investigation. Contrary to observation in glycyrrhizin, no correlation could be deduced between flavonoid accumulation and maturation of the axenic root cultures. The part of tissue present between stem and root had a moderate amount of all the compounds except 18-\u03b1 glycyrrhetinic acid. It showed maximum presence of glabridine (13.1 \u00b5g/mg) followed by 4\u2032-O-methylglabridine (10.2 \u00b5g/mg) and isoliquiritigenin (9.5 \u00b5g/mg) and hispaglabridine B (9.8 \u00b5g/mg). Literature survey on flavonoid contents of in vitro raised plantlets/organ culture in Glycyrrhiza species gave scattered information. Most of the published studies have reported various flavonoids in cell suspension cultures of Glycyrrhiza inflate (Li et al. 2012), Glycyrrhiza echinata, G. glabra (Furuya et al. 1971, 1976) and G. uralensis (Wang et al. 2013). Many of the researchers are of the view that in vitro cultures of Glycyrrhiza has a better capability of production of flavonoids than the triterpenoids (Wang et al. 2013). However, reports about preferential accumulation and age-dependent synthesis of secondary metabolite are available in plants (Piatczak et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Basal medium and plant growth regulators (PGRs) play a significant role in tissue morphogenesis, differentiation and secondary metabolite production (Raj et al. 2015). As most of the terpenoids and flavonoids were found in the licorice roots, the role of basal media composition and PGR effect on root tissue differentiation and secondary metabolite production was investigated in in vitro raised cultures of G. glabra. Five basal media namely, full strength Murashige and Skoog (FMS), half strength MS (HMS), R medium (MS with different vitamin composition), White\u2019s (W) and Gamborg\u2019s (B) media supplemented with seven (1\u20137) PGR combinations were used to assess the response of in vitro raised root explants. Simultaneous quantification of all the lines in various combinations demonstrated that irrespective of the basal medium, the root explants evoked three types of morphogenetic response, in 47 % of the cultures (16/35). Five out of sixteen cultures showed a very weak response, either due to the browning of the callus or very slow growth and hence were not studied further. Among the cultures responded, root + callus mixed morphology was observed in 8 cultures (50 %) while pure callus and pure root morphology were seen in 5 and 3 PGR combinations, respectively. Maximum response (5 out of 7 combinations) was observed in half strength MS medium (HMS), followed by R medium (4/7) and full MS and Gamborg\u2019s media (3/7). While White\u2019s medium responded only in one PGR combination (1/7), recorded after 2 weeks of culturing. A better response (4) was observed in MS medium when vitamin composition of full MS was changed to R vitamin combination. In the present study, the response of root explants in Gamborg\u2019s medium was noteworthy, as it responded in only 3 out of 7 combinations, and all the combinations produced only root type morphology, unlike the other basal media, where pure callus and root + callus morphology were dominant. In accordance with earlier observations of Gopitha et al. (2010), the present study also concludes that IBA augmented media is better in root induction than IAA. Browning was observed in FM6 & 7 cultures, Parsaeimehr and Mousavi (2009) also reported browning of callus when BAP and NAA growth hormones were used (Parsaeimehr and Mousavi 2009). Wongwicha et al. (2008) reported MS basal medium supplemented with 2, 4 D or NAA + kinetin growth regulators, to be a better medium for calli induction in G. uralensis (Wongwicha et al. 2008). The present study also observed better root multiplication in \u00bd MS medium supplemented with high concentrations of auxin (IAA/IBA) as was reported by Thengane et al. (1998). Findings of the study suggested growth hormone NAA in combination with IAA or IBA evoked callusing while NAA alone resulted in root initiation. Similar observations were recorded by (Elias et al. 2015) in shoot induction in Ecinocereus cinerascens under in vitro conditions.",

            "text": "The biochemical spectrum of the root explants, grown in different cultures in various PGR combinations, varied widely (Table 1). Among the flavonoids, maximum flavonoids (5) were detected in root + callus cultures having the combination of NAA + BAP growth regulators (F6). As can be seen from the Table 1, butin (0.31\u20134.32 \u00b5g/mg) and hispaglabridine A (0.53\u201350.00 \u00b5g/mg) were found in all the cultures in varied quantities. Hispaglabridine B and glabridine were not detected in any of the cultures, while formononetin (0.94\u20132.76 \u00b5g/mg), isoliquiritigenin (0.41\u20130.60 \u00b5g/mg) and quercitin (0.27\u20133.00 \u00b5g/mg) were found in few cultures. 18-\u03b1 glycyrritinic acid could not be detected in most of the samples except in axenic roots (H2) supplemented with \u00bdMS media containing (1 mg/ml) IBA. The varied chemical spectrum is probably due to PGR effect as the root explants were of same age and origin and were grown under similar in vitro conditions. Recent works of on Anacyclus pyrethrum (Singh et al. 2015) and Securinega suffruticose (Raj et al. 2015) have demonstrated the effect of PGR combinations on plant differentiation and secondary metabolite accumulation.",

All the investigated compounds, except the 18-\u03b1 glycyrrhetinic acid, was present in the mature root of the in vitro culture, and their quantity was found to increase with an increase in the maturity or age. Further, it was observed that hispaglabridine A was not found in 2 and 4-week old axenic root and stolon cultures, the compound could only be detected in the brown stolons and underground plant part (4 months), indicating a certain level of cellular organization or maturity of the tissue is a prerequisite for its biosynthesis. It was further noted that MS medium supplemented with auxins (NAA/IBA) had a positive effect on glycyrrhizin production. This is also supported by the observation that auxin predominately induced rooting, while its combination with kinetin or BAP resulted in callusing, in the present study. These findings are also in agreement with the culture medium composition recorded in earlier studies where glycyrrhizin was detected in Glycyrrhiza species (Gupta et al. 2013; Kojoma et al. 2010). Careful analysis of the quantification data (Table 1) showed mature stolon to be a good source of many flavonoids including hispaglabridine B, glabridine, 4\u2032-O-methylglabridine, butin, and isoliquiritigenin, while aerial plant part was predominantly rich in hispaglabridine B (62.64 ng/mg) and quercitin (1.42 ng/mg). Secondary metabolites are synthesized in specific tissues at a certain developmental stage of the plant. Their production is significantly influenced by delicate physiological changes. With a better understanding of the cell culture behavior, their higher production through media modulation can be achieved.",

Isoliquiritigenin was similarly detected in the underground parts of the plantlets and organ cultures, in the present study. Its quantity, though, was found to be more in organized tissue than the undifferentiated mass. The isoliquiritigenin content varied between 1.22 \u00b5g/mg (mature stolon) to 9.48 \u00b5g/mg (the part between root and stolon), confirming the earlier report (Man et al. 2013) on isoliquiritigenin production in tissue culture raised plantlet of G. glabra (0.4\u20139.5 \u00b5g/mg). Our literature search revealed no reports on Hispaglabridine A/B, butin, a flavanone, and quercetin, flavonoid detection from the tissue cultures of Glycyrrhiza species. In the present study hispaglabridine A/B were found in most of the organ culture analyzed (Table 1) including underground plant parts and organ cultures. However, the compound was found to be absent in the aerial part and unorganized cell mass analyzed in the present study. The present LCMS-based analyses detected butin in all the in vitro raised samples analyzed, ranging between 0.31 \u00b5g/mg (F6) callus to 4.32 \u00b5g/mg (H7) in mixed morphology. The observation carries significance as flavonoids such as HispaglabridineA/B, glabridine and butin are being reported for the first time in G. glabra under tissue cultures conditions.",

Preliminary in vitro cytotoxicity of all the tested compounds (1\u201310) was evaluated by performing a comprehensive screening at a single dose of 100 \u00b5g/ml, employing MTT assay, against various human cancer cell lines encompassing human breast cancer (MCF-7), pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2), lung cancer cell line (A549) colon cancer cell line (HCT-116). The results are summarized in Table 2 and expressed as a percentage (%) of growth inhibition. The results demonstrated that extracts induced cell growth inhibition ranged between nil to 44 % in breast cancer, 43 % in lung cancer and 11 % in colon cancer cell lines. Pancreatic cancer cell lines showed inhibition ranging between 2\u201319 %. Out of the fourteen samples tested, pancreatic cancer cell lines responded to all the extracts examined, while the minimum response was observed in colon cancer cell lines (6). Field root, SPB shoot, and 11 PM extracts exhibited more than 40 % cell growth inhibitory effect in A549 and Mcf-7 cells. Root extract prepared from field grown plant was found to be the most potent amongst the series that exhibited around 44 % cell growth inhibition against breast cancer Mcf-7 cells (supplementary Figure 2). Further, extracts having a higher amount of glycyrrhizin notably showed a higher percentage of growth inhibition in breast cancer cell lines, while relatively more content of flavonoid displayed higher inhibitory activity in lung cancer cell lines in the present study.\n",

Present results points towards a close association between cell differentiation and glycyrrhizin metabolism and also indicated the influence of the state of differentiation (under the influence of PGRs and basal media) on flavonoid spectrum. Metabolite spectrum of tissues at different stages of differentiation observed during the present study, offers a platform for understanding the inter-play between gene function and cellular regulatory processes involved in triterpenoid and flavonoid metabolism in G. glabra. It is a well-established fact that the functions of genes belonging to multi-gene families are widely divergent regarding substrate specificity and reaction sensitivity. In this context, medium modulation to regulate tissue differentiation could help in understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in the production of the studied eight flavonoids and two terpenoids in the plant under investigation. Additionally, the study has further extended the biochemical spectrum of the in vitro raised morphogenetic lines, their metabolite flux and role in distribution pattern inside the tissue and cell differentiation.",
