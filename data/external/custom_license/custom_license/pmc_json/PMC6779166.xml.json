            "text": "The epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract constitute a vast surface area that is vulnerable to infection by pathogens, including many strains of viruses from different families. Respiratory viral infections result in diseases ranging from the common cold to bronchiolitis to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Viruses are the most commonly detected pathogens in adults with community-acquired pneumonia, with rhinoviruses and influenza viruses accounting for the highest prevalence of cases [1]. Human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and coronaviruses are also significant causes of pneumonia in adults [1]. Children experience an average of one to four respiratory infections per year [2], with rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza viruses being the most common viruses detected, regardless of disease severity [3]. Although there is not a one-size-fits-all immune response that is effective against respiratory viral infections, one key factor is to induce effective antiviral responses while limiting immune-mediated pathology [4\u20136]. While a robust response is needed to limit viral spread to the lower respiratory tract and clear the infection, excessive inflammation and destruction by cytotoxic cells leads to immunopathology. The epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract are critical for effecting this balance during viral infection.",

Infected epithelial cells play a key role in signaling innate cellular antiviral responses, orchestrating responses by myeloid and lymphoid cells, and promoting epithelial repair.

            "text": "Epithelial cells that span the length of the respiratory tract from the nasal to alveolar compartments respond to viral infection by producing cytokines and chemokines that communicate with immune cells to activate and regulate antiviral responses. Primary cultures of airway and alveolar epithelial cells are an invaluable system for characterizing the response of highly differentiated epithelial cells to viral infections. Highly differentiated cultures of primary human nasal epithelial cells are susceptible to rhinovirus replication, predominantly in ciliated cells [14]. Innate immune sensing (TLR7, RIG-I) and effector molecules (type I and III interferons), and proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL-9, 10, 11, and CCL5) are expressed by infected nasal epithelial cells [14]. IAV induces a similar innate response in primary nasal [15, 16], bronchial [17], and alveolar [18, 19] epithelial cells. Coronaviruses are more restrictive in the epithelial cell types that they replicate in in vitro [20\u201324]. In primary human AT2 cells, human coronavirus HKU1 induces expression of type III IFN, CXCL10, and CCL5 [23]. The highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, induce reduced or delayed expression of cytokines in a human lung epithelial cell line, which is thought to be due to avoidance of recognition by innate receptors in the infected cell [25, 26]. RSV infection of well-differentiated pediatric bronchial epithelial cells induces secretion of chemokines that are also detected in infants with severe RSV disease, including IL-6, CCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL10 [27, 28]. Mouse models of differentiated respiratory epithelial cells recapitulate many of these findings and can be used as a widely available and tractable system in which to understand epithelial responses to respiratory viral infections [24, 29].",

A direct comparison of the response of primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells to RSV and IAV infections demonstrated that IAV induces a much stronger response; however, shared gene expression signatures include type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-induced chemokines, including CXCL-9, 10, 11, and 8 and CCL5 [17]. Similarly, wild-type IAV and the matched live attenuated influenza vaccine induce similar gene expression responses in cultures of primary human nasal epithelial cells, though the vaccine strain induces a more robust response [16]. Although IAV and rhinovirus induce unique gene expression signatures, genes involved in viral detection, type I IFN responses, and cytokine and chemokine genes have shared upregulation by the two unrelated viruses in human bronchial epithelial cells and a mouse lung cell line [30, 31].",

Fewer studies have demonstrated the contribution of these responses to the overall response to respiratory viral infection within the lungs. Stegemann-Koniszewski et al. analyzed gene expression in purified AT2 cells from IAV-infected mice compared to mRNA from whole lung tissue. They found that AT2 cells make a significant contribution to gene expression responses in the lungs of IAV-infected mice [32\u2022\u2022]. While several chemokines had increased expression in AT2 cells upon IAV infection, expression of CXCL5 and CCL5 was induced higher in AT2 cells than the whole lung tissue. The robust gene expression response of AT2 cells in vivo suggest that these cells are not only responding directly to viral infection, but are also responding to signals from cells in their environment. Co-culture systems that evaluate the responses of AT2 cells to viral infection in the context of the other cell types within the lung during infection are critical to understand the response of AT2 cells to environmental cues during infection. A complementary approach in which cytokine expression was evaluated in alveolar macrophages in response to RSV infection ex vivo compared to cytokines expressed early in RSV-infected lung tissues identified a set of cytokines that are likely to be expressed by epithelial cells and not alveolar macrophages [33].",

Depletion of inflammatory monocyte-macrophages in a mouse model of SARS-coronavirus infection results in a significant reduction of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CCL2 in the airways [34]. Mice that were humanized with T and B cells have increased human, but not mouse, CCL3 and IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs upon infection by RSV [35\u2022].

A novel IFN-\u03b2 reporter mouse that expresses luciferase from the IFN-\u03b2 promoter was used to demonstrate the cell-type specificity of IFN-\u03b2 production upon influenza virus infection [40\u2022]. Infection of the reporter mice with wild-type IAV restricted IFN-\u03b2 response to non-epithelial cells, as the virus antagonized the IFN response in infected epithelial cells. However, upon infection by a mutant virus that does not express IFN antagonist, IFN-\u03b2 was expressed by infected epithelial cells and virus antigen-positive macrophages [40\u2022]. In a mouse model of SARS-coronavirus infection, IFN-\u03b2 is expressed predominantly by airway epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells [34]. The early production of IFN-\u03b2 by virus-infected epithelial cells is likely important for communicating with uninfected cells as well as immune cells.",

Communication between AM and alveolar epithelial cells is bi-directional, occurring through cell surface receptors, gap junctional channels, release and uptake of secreted microparticles, and cytokine signaling [41, 42]. During homeostasis, epithelial cells provide inhibitory signaling to prevent activation of AM in the airspaces. Upon viral infection, this anti-inflammatory signaling is overcome to promote initiation of antiviral immune responses. AM can contribute to protection or pathology during viral infection, depending on the virus. Depletion of AM from mice prior to inoculation with RSV or IAV worsens disease, but lessens the severity of metapneumovirus or SARS-coronavirus infections [43\u201346]. In the case of SARS-coronavirus infection in mice, AM have an inhibitory influence on dendritic cell activation and the subsequent development of T cell responses [46].",

Cardani et al. showed that AM protect AT1 cells from IAV infection by inhibiting leukotriene D4 [48\u2022\u2022]. AT1 cells of mice that are deficient specifically in alveolar macrophages, but not other myeloid cell types, have increased susceptibility to IAV. Furthermore, inhibition of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 in alveolar macrophage-deficient mice reversed this enhanced susceptibility phenotype [48\u2022\u2022].

More recently, Chahar et al. demonstrated that exosomes released from RSV-infected epithelial cells stimulate chemokine production by monocytes [50\u2022\u2022]. Although the mechanism of monocyte activation is not known, exosomes are not able to spread RSV to uninfected cells.

Although cultured monocytes are not permissive to rhinovirus infection [52], co-culture of monocytes with epithelial cells enhances infection in the monocytes [51\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, enhancement of monocyte susceptibility to rhinovirus infection is not dependent upon infection of the epithelial cells, as conditioned medium from uninfected epithelial cells also promotes this effect. Epithelial cells were shown to upregulate ICAM-1 on the monocytes and thus mediate susceptibility to major serogroup rhinoviruses that use ICAM-1 to enter cells. Thus, monocyte infection may occur in the context of epithelial cells in vivo. As active replication of rhinovirus in monocytes leads to higher production of inflammatory cytokines, if this mechanism occurs in vivo, it may contribute to enhanced inflammation during rhinovirus infection.",

Co-culture of myeloid DC with airway epithelial cells results in dramatic changes in gene expression by the DC, compared to culture of DC in isolation [62]. While the co-cultured DC have both increased and decreased expression of various chemokines, genes involved in pathogen recognition were consistently upregulated, suggesting that the epithelial cells signal DC to be on alert for infection prior to stimulation. Cytokines made by infected epithelial cells can also impact the polarity of DC-induced helper T cell responses by promoting either antiviral TH1 responses or allergic TH2 responses [63].

Our lab and others have shown that epithelial cells directly regulate neutrophil functions. Rat coronavirus infection of AT1 cells induces expression and secretion of CXC chemokines [74], which signal through CXCR2 on neutrophils to promote their recruitment and activation. Furthermore, medium from rat coronavirus-infected AT1 cells directs neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro through CXC chemokines and CXCR2-dependent signaling [75\u2022\u2022]. In addition to chemotaxis, medium from coronavirus-infected AT1 cells also inhibits spontaneous and TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis of neutrophils, which is partially dependent on CXCR2 signaling [75\u2022\u2022]. Thus, coronavirus-infected epithelial cells not only promote recruitment of neutrophils to the respiratory tract, but also may contribute to prolonging their lifespan within infected lung tissue. These functions may have opposing effects during rat coronavirus infection. Depletion of neutrophils early during rat coronavirus infection enhances disease severity and prolongs viral infection, demonstrating their contribution to an effective immune response [76]. However, the presence of neutrophils late during infection corresponds with the presence of gross and histological lesions and increased epithelial permeability [76]. Thus, their maintained presence due to inhibition of apoptosis may contribute to disease pathology.",

Furthermore, transmigration of neutrophils through RSV-infected epithelial monolayers caused increased damage to the epithelial cells compared to neutrophil transmigration in response to fMLP [77\u2022\u2022]. Thus, RSV-infected epithelial cells direct neutrophil migration and activation, which enhances damage to the epithelial barrier.

In mice, bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells are responsible for the majority of FGF2 production induced by IAV infection [78]. Furthermore, depletion of FGF2 in infected mice increases the severity of disease [78]. The primary role of FGF2 in this system is to promote neutrophil chemotaxis and activation, which is needed for survival [78]. While FGF2 has many functions that could contribute to protection, disease severity was reduced when neutrophil recruitment to the lungs of FGF2 deficient animals was restored. Furthermore, treatment of a lethal IAV infection with recombinant FGF2 was effective, but not in mice that had been depleted of neutrophils. This suggests that the protective effects of epithelial FGF2 in this mouse model of IAV infection are due primarily to neutrophil recruitment.",

            "text": "While a majority of studies focus on interactions between respiratory epithelial cells and innate immune cells, a few studies have reported interactions between the respiratory epithelium and lymphocytes. Cytokines and chemokines produced by infected epithelial cells recruit, activate, and orchestrate the functions of T lymphocytes. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is expressed by RSV-infected airway epithelial cells, and TSLP levels correspond with TH2 cytokine production and the development of allergic asthma [79, 80\u2022\u2022]. Enhanced TSLP production by bronchial epithelial cells in response to viral infection is a proposed mechanism of asthma exacerbation [80\u2022\u2022]. As described above, PD-1 ligands are expressed by virus-infected epithelial cells and, in addition to regulating monocyte functions, can affect CD8+ T cell functions during RSV infection. Co-culture of RSV-infected bronchial epithelial cells with CD8+ T cells promotes their activation [54\u2022\u2022]. However, inhibition of PD-L1 signaling in this system increases T cell effector functions, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and granzyme B expression and concomitantly decreases viral loads in the epithelial cells [54\u2022\u2022]. IAV has also been shown to upregulate PD-L1 expression in human airway epithelial cultures [53\u2022\u2022]. Further, IAV-induced expression of PD-L1 is dependent on type I IFN signaling in mouse tracheal epithelial cultures and thus may represent a generalized response to viral infection [53\u2022\u2022]. Similar to the studies with RSV, inhibition of PD-1 signaling during IAV infection enhances CD8+ T cell functions in a co-culture model and in the airways of infected mice [53\u2022\u2022]. Thus, by increasing expression of PD-L1 by epithelial cells, viruses downregulate the effector functions of CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting viral replication.",

As described above, GM-CSF is secreted by alveolar epithelial cells upon viral infection and also in response to TNF-\u03b1 produced by stimulated alveolar macrophages [65\u2022\u2022, 70]. GM-CSF promotes proliferation of AT2 cells, which leads to repair of damaged epithelium and restoration of its barrier functions [70]. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) promotes proliferation of AT2 cells and is protective against alveolar damage [83, 84]. IL-1\u03b2 secreted by epithelial cells stimulates production of KGF by fibroblasts, which enhances susceptibility of AT2 cells to IAV infection [85]. The production of growth factors while virus is still replicating in the lungs may worsen disease, while their stimulation of AT2 cell division would promote repair of epithelial damage. Thus, the timing of growth factor expression may be critical for repair vs. pathogenesis during respiratory viral infection. Macrophages that have been stimulated by IAV-infected epithelial cells provide signaling back to the epithelial cells that results in inhibition of Na, K-ATPase, and thus fluid absorption by epithelial cells [86\u2022\u2022]. This results in fluid accumulation in the alveoli and contributes to pathogenesis. Immune cells can also provide positive feedback to epithelial cells to amplify responses. For example, interferon signaling by monocytes stimulate the production of CXCL10 by bronchial epithelial cells during rhinovirus infection [87\u2022\u2022].",
