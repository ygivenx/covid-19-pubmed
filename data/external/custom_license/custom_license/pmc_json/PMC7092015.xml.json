            "text": "Biochemical and genetic studies have revealed the molecular mechanismes, by which dsRNA causes the degradation of target messenger RNA 11. RNAi includes two steps: initiation step and effector step 12. In the initiation step, Dicer, a member of the RNase III family of ATP-dependent ribonucleases, binds with high affinity to dsRNA containing 2 nucleiotide (nt) 3\u2032 overhangs and chops long dsRNA (introduced directly or via a transgene or virus) into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) duplexes. Generally, Dicer enzymes contain an N-terminal DEXH-box RNA helicase domain, a domain of unknown function (DUF283), a PAZ domain, two RIII domains and a dsRNA-bingding domain (dsRBD) 13. Dicer can cleave dsRNA into siRNAs or microRNAs (miRNAs) from endogenous stem loop precursors 14. Biochemical studies show that siRNAs are 21-23 nt dsRNA duplexes with 2-nt 3\u2032 overhangs, a 5\u2032-monophosphate and a 3\u2032-hydroxyl group 15. In the effector step, the siRNA duplexes are incorporated into RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). The phosphorylation of siRNA 5\u2032-terminal is required to entry into RISC 16. A helicase domain of RISC binds to one end of the duplex and unwinds the double-strand in an ATP-dependent manner. The thermodynamic stability of the first few base pairs of siRNA can affect the ratio of RISC containing the antisense or sense strands of siRNAs 17. Dicer with R2D2 (Dcr-2-associated protein) binds siRNA and facilitates its loading onto RISC 18. The active RISC then targets the homologous transcript by base pairing interactions and cleaves the mRNA between the 10th and 11th nucleotide from the 5\u2032 terminus of the siRNAs 16,19.",

In comparison with other conventional drugs, siRNA have many advantages. First, it is much easier and more flexible to select target sites because target mRNA and siRNA are sequences-specific and complementary. For a given mRNA molecule, the inhibitory effects of siRNAs can be achieved by targeting different regions of target mRNA. Second, for gene silencing, only substoichiometric amount of siRNA is enough to drastically decrease homologous mRNA within 24 h. Third, siRNAs can result in the degradation of cognate mRNA in cells of different species. Today, researchers are developing efficient siRNA delivery systems, which can help siRNAs enter efficiently into cells in nearly all organs. Fourth, siRNAs do not seem to adversely affect cell control mechanisms. The given length and high homology of siRNA to the target region of cognate transcription ensure the selective destruction of only interested transcript. siRNAs without suitable targets seem to remain inert within cells. This exclusive specificity without adverse side effects is the most attractive feature of RNAi as an antiviral approach. Fifth, siRNAs can silence gene stably. With the application of plasmid vectors and viral vectors, siRNAs can display their long-term biological effects 25. Taken together, siRNAs synthesis in vivo or in vitro transfected into cultured cells or animals could result in the sequence-specific silencing of mRNA molecules. With the proof-of-concept studies, siRNAs have been widely used as an alternate therapeutic strategy.",

Gitlin et al revealed that RNAi effectively prevented viral infection in mammalian cells by using siRNAs against the poliovirus genome. Subsequently, they indicated that pretreatment of human and murine cells with siRNA duplexes to the poliovirus genome (capsid and 3D polymerase) could prevent plaque formation and result in a 100-fold reduction of the progeny titer in one-step growth curves 9. In these experiments, siRNAs promote clearance of the virus from most infected cells 10.",

It has essential functions in the virus life-cycle, including the attachment of the virus particles to cell receptors and the penetration of the virions into the cell. Dector et al showed that a small interfering RNA corresponding to the VP4 gene efficiently inhibited the synthesis of this protein in virus infected monkey kidney MA104 cells. A large proportion of infected cells had no detectable VP4 protein and the yield of viral progeny was reduced. Most of the virus particles purified from these cells were poorly infectious. The VP4 gene silencing was specific because the synthesis of VP4 gene from rotavirus strains with different target sequence was not affected. These findings offer a novel therapeutic approach for the assembly of viral particles 53.",
