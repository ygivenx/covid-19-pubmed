Individuals with SARS usually develop a high fever followed by severe clinical symptoms including acute respiratory distress syndrome with a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) at autopsy2,4,9. The containment of SARS has been achieved largely through traditional quarantine and sanitation measures9,10. Because SARS is a newly emerging disease, a safe and effective vaccine is not yet available11, although some candidate vaccines have been advanced to monkey models and clinical testing12,13,14,15. To treat individuals with SARS, combinations of existing drugs, including ribavirin, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids and immune stimulators, have achieved some clinical success16,17,18. Many ongoing efforts to develop SARS-specific drugs, such as screening of small-molecule inhibitors and current biologic approaches, will clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, based on the ultimate success rate and the time and cost incurred19,20.",

Meanwhile, development of macaque models became important not only for understanding SARS pathogenesis but also for evaluation of potential vaccines and therapeutics11,12,13,16,19,20. Recently, a Rhesus macaque SARS model was established with intranasal instillation of SCV strain PUMC01, showing many elements of pathology similar to those of individuals with SARS21,22. The pathogenesis includes elevated body temperature, low appetite and acute DAD clearly visible at 7 d after infection (d.p.i.), but with somewhat worse severity than other macaque SARS models19,20, offering an ideal model for evaluation of therapeutic candidates.",

We reported a screen of 48 siRNA candidates targeting elements throughout the entire SCV genome and identified several siRNAs active in SCV-infected fatal Rhesus monkey kidney (FRhK-4) cells24, distinct from other active siRNA reported by other labs25,26,27,28. However, translation of in vitro siRNA activity into clinically useful therapeutics depends on a clinically acceptable means for administration. Therefore, siRNAs showing prominent prophylactic and therapeutic activity in cell culture24, referred to as siSC2 and siSC5, were further evaluated in vivo, first using a reporter gene assay in mice and subsequently using a clinically acceptable intranasal administration in the recently established Rhesus macaque SARS model21,22. The study provided strong evidence that these siRNA agents are potent both for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of SARS infection, and they lack toxicity in this nonhuman primate model. The results support the growing expectation that siRNA can fulfill the need for moving rapidly from gene sequence to targeted therapeutic agents for many previously intractable disease targets.",

Cotransfection of pCI-scLuc and siSC2-5 into cultured cells confirmed that siSC2-5 can specifically knock down luciferase expression (data not shown). To identify a clinically viable carrier for siRNA delivery into mouse lung, we selected two carriers currently in clinical use, D5W solution29 and Infasurf solution30, which have been applied in delivery of DNA31 and siRNA32 to animal models. Twenty-four hours after intratracheal administration of 30 \u03bcg of pCI-scLuc plasmid DNA and 30 \u03bcg of siSC2-5 in 100 \u03bcl of D5W or Infasurf solution into BALB/c mouse lungs, we analyzed luciferase expression in the lung tissues. Co-delivery of pCI-scLuc plasmid with siSC2-5 in D5W solution resulted in a higher level of reporter gene expression and a stronger RNAi effect than that delivered in the Infasurf solution (Fig. 1d). We noted that TransIT-TKO and polyethyleneimine have been reported as carriers for intranasal33, intratracheal34 and intravenous35 deliveries of siRNA into mouse models for treatment of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus infections. But those carriers are not feasible for clinical use, especially polyethyleneimine, because it can induce severe lung inflammation through either intravenous or intratracheal delivery in mice based on our experience (data not shown) and literature reports36,37. The substantial silencing effect achieved in mouse lungs strongly supported that siSC2-5 is a potent inhibitor of SCV RNA, but also that D5W is a very effective carrier for siRNA in the mammalian respiratory tract. In addition, a lack of visible lung damage after intratracheal delivery of 30 \u03bcg siRNA and 30 \u03bcg plasmid DNA together provided a safe baseline for siRNA dosing to the respiratory tract of larger mammals.",

In histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) inspections, we found that most of the lungs, at both 7 and 20 d.p.i., displayed acute DAD with various degrees of severity. The typical features of SCV infection\u2013induced lung damage include broken alveolar walls and interstitial edema (Fig. 3a), hyaline membrane formation along the alveoli and pneumocyte desquamation (Fig. 3b), damaged alveolus filled with hemorrhage and pneumocytes with nuclear enlargement, prominent nucleolus and amphophilic granular cytoplasm (Fig. 3c), and interstitial infiltrates with neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages (Fig. 3d). Within damaged lung tissues, we identified viral-infected pneumocytes, infiltrated neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes using IHC stains of keratin (Fig. 3e), CD68 (Fig. 3f), CD4, CD8 and CD35 (data not shown). These characteristics were very similar to those observed in individuals with SARS9,10 and SARS macaque models19,20,21,22. Therefore, this Rhesus macaque model provides an ideal system for evaluation of new therapeutic agents against SARS.",

We recorded body temperature of every animal daily until it was killed. Comparison of the mean body temperatures of all five groups (Fig. 4a) revealed significantly lower temperatures of all treated groups (prophylactic, co-delivery and postexposure treatment groups; below 38.9 \u00b0C) versus the control groups (viral infection and nonspecific siRNA groups), which had temperatures above 39.1 \u00b0C, indicating a fever status22. The prophylactic treatment group had the lowest temperature (38.7 \u00b0C), close to the normal body temperature of Rhesus monkey (38.5 \u00b0C). Examining the distribution of the average body temperature at each time point throughout the entire 20-d period with trend regression (Fig. 4b), we found that viral infection and nonspecific siRNA control groups had consistently elevated temperatures above 39 \u00b0C. Macaque #212 from the viral infection control group had a high fever (40 \u00b0C) at 4 d.p.i. and the fever lasted until the macaque was killed at 20 d.p.i. for pathology analysis, at which time it showed a severe lung damage that we scored as \u201c+++\u201d. A similar situation was seen for macaque #208 of the nonspecific siRNA group. The comparison of mean body temperature trend regression clearly shows the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of siSC2-5 on suppression of fever induced by SCV infection. In addition, the inhibitory effects of siSC2-5 also resulted in lowering SCV-specific IgG titer in blood samples (Fig. 4c). We detected SCV-specific IgG levels in viral control and nonspecific siRNA control groups as early as 10 d.p.i., but not in the co-delivery and postexposure treatment groups. We were able to detect SCV-specific IgG titers of all groups at 19 d.p.i.",

They showed that SCV viral RNA was detectable in all samples from the viral infection and nonspecific siRNA control groups, but undetectable in 75% of the samples from the siSC2-5 treatment groups (Fig. 5a). This result indicated the possible inhibition of SCV infection and replication through siSC2-5\u2013facilitated viral RNA degradation in upper airway epithelial cells. The three positive samples from the treatment groups suggest that the dosing regimens were unable to totally eliminate SCV infection. The histopathology analyses of those macaques (#130, 166 and 210) have indeed shown some degrees of lung damage at scores of \u201c+\u201d or \u201c++\u201d. The Q-RT-PCR detection of the randomly selected lung tissue specimens also showed the presence of the SCV RNA (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). We also applied the oropharyngeal swab samples for active viral rescue in the Vero cell culture, showing that samples from all five groups were positive for live SCV particles. To evaluate SCV infection in deeper lung, we carefully inspected IHC staining images from each lung section, with SCV antigen\u2013specific monoclonal antibody. The samples from viral infection and nonspecific siRNA groups presented much more infected cells (Fig. 5b\u2013d) than those from siSC2-5\u2013treated groups (Fig. 5e\u2013g). The SCV-infected cells include the type I pneumocytes (Fig. 5c,e), type II pneumocytes (Fig. 5f) and macrophages (Fig. 5d), the presence of which was consistent with the observation in the previous studies with macaque models and in individuals with SARS4,9,10,19,20,21,22. We further counted the infected cells in each lung section and compared these numbers for the five groups. The lungs from all three siSC2-5 treatment groups had significantly lower counts of the SCV-infected cells (Fig. 5h), which indicated that the siRNA treatments were able to inhibit SCV replication and spread within the monkey lungs.",

Our study put both efficacy and safety in equal consideration in order to define a therapeutic window for use of siRNA as an anti-SARS agent through airway administration. The choice of the siSC2-5 dosage at 10 mg/kg was based on the mouse study described above and study reports on antisense oligomers38. Through observation of behavior patterns of Rhesus macaques during the entire study and examination of the organs of killed animals with various siRNA dosing regimens, no safety concerns arose. The treatment groups lacked evidence of inflammation or toxicity not attributable to the SCV infection. The total accumulated dosage of siRNA administrated to individual macaques ranged from 10 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg and did not cause any visible differences in appearance, behavior or sign of organ damage when examined by autopsy and necropsy. In addition, we found no statistically significant differences in internal organ coefficients among the five groups (Supplementary Table 3 online). Reports of potential 'off-target' effects of the siRNA agent39,40,41 have been mostly based on cell-culture experiments, without evidence for in vivo siRNA toxicity29,31. From the results of routine blood examination and liver enzymatic analysis, we found some increases of alanine aminotransferase, lactic acid dehdryogenase, creatine kinase, aspartate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin and platelet levels in the blood samples. Because those increases are from SCV-infected macaques, with or without siRNA treatment, they were probably results from the viral infection rather than the siRNA treatments (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 online).",

The impact of siSC2-5 on the early phase of SCV infection was first shown in the mucosal epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, as expected because both the siSC2-5 and SCV were administered through intranasal instillation and all siRNA dosing was complete within the first 5 d. This anti-SARS efficacy of siSC2-5 could be the result of one or more of the following three mechanisms: protection of cells from SCV infection, degradation of SCV mRNA inhibiting viral protein synthesis in infected cells24, or obstruction of SCV genome replication and spread to uninfected cells. Considering that SARS-specific neutralizing antibody in SCV-infected macaques can be detected as early as 10 d.p.i., we speculated that the clinical benefit of siRNA-mediated anti-SARS activity observed in this study was the consequence of combined activities of the siRNA agent and the neutralizing antibody, suggesting that multiple antiviral mechanisms were operative.",

The prophylactic anti-SCV activity resulted in a lower body temperature, milder lung damage, less viral RNA detected and lower numbers of SCV-infected cells in the lung, in comparison with co-delivery and postexposure treatment groups. The mechanism of action might be the result of direct degradation of viral RNA by preexisting siSC2-5 within the upper airway cells upon entry of the viral particle, blocking replication and spread of SCV particles.

This observation was also echoed by a report that intravenous siRNA delivery in mice resulted in a lack of interferon induction in vivo46.

The presence of hemophagocytosis47,48 or an interferon-\u03b3\u2013related cytokine storm in individuals with SARS49 complicates our understanding of SARS pathogenesis but also argues against use of interferon therapy in clinical treatment, despite studies in cell culture18, a macaque model19 and individuals with SARS50 that showed inhibition of SCV with interferon treatment. In contrast to such proinflammatory cytokine treatments, intranasal delivery of siRNA offers a unique method for high-specificity inhibition of SCV with minimal induction of a proinflammatory cytokine antiviral response that may help to avoid exacerbation of symptoms and lung damage. Here, we present evidence for a strong anti-SARS activity without any visible adverse effects through intranasal administration of siSC2-5 in a clinically viable aqueous solution with a nonhuman primate SARS model. Our data suggest that clinical testing of siSC2-5 agent as a SARS treatment is warranted. This work also shows the tremendous potential for siRNA to enable rapid development of treatments for emerging infectious agents, and for powerful 'targeted' therapeutics acting at the level of gene expression.",
