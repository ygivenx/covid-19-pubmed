Specimens tested for influenza and RSV were obtained from pediatric inpatients at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, patients from Singapore General Hospital and other public-sector hospitals, as well as from adult outpatients with influenzalike symptoms treated at sentinel primary health clinics.

If no effect was observed, the HeLa tubes were passaged blind at weekly intervals, and monkey kidney tissue cultures were tested for hemadsorption with guinea pig erythrocytes. Specimens were discarded after 4 weeks if negative. Influenza virus isolates were subsequently confirmed by immunofluorescence and typed by hemagglutination-inhibition tests using strain-specific antisera provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.",

The 95% CI for each estimated fraction was obtained by using the bootstrap resampling method with 1,000 bootstrap resamples (19). The number of excess deaths attributable to influenza was then derived by multiplying the total number of deaths in each mortality category by the respective influenza-associated mortality fraction (6,20). We also derived the excess mortality rate per 100,000 person-years by dividing the number of excess deaths during the study period by the sum of the annual midyear population for the entire 8-year period.
