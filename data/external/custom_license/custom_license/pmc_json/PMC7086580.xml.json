The first identified torovirus was isolated from a horse with diarrhea (equine torovirus, EToV, also called Berne virus) in 1972 [23, 27, 29]. A few years later, torovirus was also found in American calves with diarrhea (bovine torovirus, BToV, also called Breda virus) [29] and in humans with gastroenteritis (human torovirus, HToV) [2, 14, 15]. The presence of torovirus in swine fecal specimens was also verified, but there has not been a report of obvious clinical symptoms or economic losses [16\u201320, 22].",
