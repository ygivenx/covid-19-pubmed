Infections with human\nstrains HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild, self-limiting\nrespiratory infections such as the common cold.2,24 Nevertheless, in the past 17 years, three beta\ncoronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and this year\u2019s SARS-CoV-2) have caused severe\nhuman disease pandemics associated with high morbidity and mortality. The outbreak of SARS\nin southern China between November 2002 and July 2003 eventually resulted in 8098\nconfirmed cases and 774 deaths reported in 17 countries with a mortality rate of 9%, while\nMERS, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, has caused a total of 2519\nlaboratory-confirmed cases including 866 associated deaths with a fatality rate of nearly\n34% at the end of January 2020.25,26 The lack of effective treatment for coronavirus infections poses a\ngreat challenge to clinical management and highlights the urgent need for new drug\ndiscovery. Wu et al. found that niclosamide was able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication and\ntotally abolished viral antigen synthesis at a concentration of 1.56 \u03bcM after\nscreening a small marketed drug library.27 Niclosamide suppressed the\ncytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV at a concentration of as low as 1 \u03bcM and\ninhibited SARS-CoV replication with an EC50 value of less than 0.1 \u03bcM in\nVero E6 cells.28 SARS-CoV 3CL protease plays an important role in\nreplicase polyprotein processing and serves as a key target for anti-SARS drug\ndiscovery.29\u221231 A series of\n2-chloro-4-nitroanilide derivatives was discovered as potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV\n3CL protease. Interestingly, niclosamide showed no obvious inhibitory activity against\nSARS-CoV 3CL protease up to 50 \u03bcM, and mechanistically, it may exert its anti-SARS\nactivity via other modes of action.32",

Many of these viruses are\nsignificant human pathogens. Among these viruses, ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that\nis transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV infection can cause\ninfants to be born with microcephaly and can trigger neurologic conditions in adults such\nas Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neuropathy, and myelitis.34\u221238 Outbreaks of ZIKV infection have been recorded several\ntimes (2015 in Brazil, the latest one), and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared\nZIKV to be a global public health emergency. Xu et al. used caspase-3 activity as the\nprimary screening assay and discovered niclosamide as a potent inhibitor of ZIKV\ninfection, displaying an IC50 value of 0.37 \u03bcM against the intracellular\nZIKV RNA level.22 The time-of-addition studies indicated that\nniclosamide inhibits ZIKV infection at a postentry stage, probably in a viral RNA\nreplication step. Our research team also identified niclosamide as a potent anti-ZIKV\ninhibitor through an independent quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) campaign\nand found that niclosamide directly inhibits flavivirus NS2B-NS3 interactions.14 Protease complex NS2B-NS3 is essential for flaviviral polyprotein\nprocessing.39\u221241 Our team also found that\nniclosamide is a broad-spectrum inhibitor against other flaviviruses including DENV-2,\nWNV, JEV, and YFV, with potencies similar to that for ZIKV.14",

One 7 day course\nregimen for adults is 2 g of niclosamide on day 1 followed by 1 g daily for 6\ndays.10,55 When\ntreating human volunteers each with a single oral dose of 2000 mg of niclosamide, the\nmaximum serum concentration of niclosamide was equivalent to 0.25\u20136.0 \u03bcg/mL\n(0.76\u201318.3 \u03bcM). The wide concentration range was caused by the intraindividual\nabsorption differences. Niclosamide is only partially absorbed from the intestinal tract,\nand the absorbed part is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys with no cumulative toxic effects\nin human.10 Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns,\nniclosamide was found to be effective against a variety of human conditions such as cancer\nand viral infections. Currently, there are four ongoing human clinical trials of niclosamide\nin ulcerative colitis, prostate carcinoma, and colorectal cancer in the ClinicalTrails.gov\nclinical trials registry.56 Of note, niclosamide has several weaknesses\nsuch as unneglectable cytotoxicity and limited aqueous solubility as well as relatively low\nabsorption and oral bioavailability (F = 10%), which may hamper its\nextensive clinical development as an antiviral agent.57 Our group has\nmade substantial efforts in medicinal chemistry based on niclosamide as a lead compound and\ndiscovered a series of O-alkylamino-tethered derivatives as potent and\norally bioavailable anticancer agents with improved aqueous solubility16\nand diversified salicylamide derivatives as potent anti-HAdV inhibitors with increased\npotency (submicromolar IC50s) and significantly decreased cytotoxicity likely by\ntargeting different steps in the HAdV life cycle.58 The ester derivative\nprodrug of niclosamide was also reported to increase its systemic drug exposure and extend\nthe duration of exposure.59 The development of nanobased formulations is\nanother useful strategy for improving the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of\nniclosamide and maximizing its therapeutic potential for clinical\napplications.60\u221262",
