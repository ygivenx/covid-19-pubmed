Regrettably, the focus of the global health care architecture that predominates the research and development agendas around the world has adopted a focus that is frequently out of line with the needs of the poor, resulting in too little attention and innovation being devoted to pressing global health problems (1). On occasion, however, an emerging health concern propels tropical diseases to the forefront of medical practice in Canada or elsewhere, prompting us to reconsider our vulnerabilities within an increasingly globalized world.",

At press time, the case fatality rate of the outbreak was 54.9%, with a cumulative total of 2240 cases and 1229 deaths, and no indications of a resolution to this epidemic (3).",

The geographical spread of cases in and between the countries affected presents a major logistical challenge in identifying and tracing individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. While much attention has been given to the development of new drugs for the treatment of Ebola, less attention has been devoted to the role of strong health systems in identifying, controlling and responding to the epidemic. Regrettably, the health systems of the affected countries face major longstanding challenges, including severe shortages of health workers. In resource-constrained settings, access to even basic primary care is poor and often hampered by systemic problems such as access to essential medicines, effective health information systems for monitoring disease trends and patterns, and the application of evidence-based treatments, making the effective detection, control and treatment of a complex disease, such as Ebola, extremely challenging.",

Unsurprisingly, the justification of this reasoned call is not because Canada harbours an effective drug for Ebola, but rather because Canada\u2019s health care system is well-equipped to effectively deal with a disease outbreak such as this. Case definitions have been established, infection control protocols are in place and our public health surveillance system is strong. Rather than being a call for complacency, the statement that our risk of an epidemic is low is, in fact, a call to arms to ensure that all health professionals are aware of how to safely care for a patient with a highly communicable disease such as Ebola, and that necessary equipment, policies and protocols are in place to be immediately put into action.",

Ebola has rarely been treated outside of a handful of resource-poor countries where access to critical care medicine is poor; it is, therefore, conceivable that with stronger resources, greater reductions in mortality could be achieved. At the same time, this also means that clinicians are largely starting anew to build the evidence base on which future treatment guidelines and protocols ought to be based. This is where academic medicine, including clinician-investigators and authors, as well as peer-reviewed journals such as ours, must play a strong role in advancing the science of global health. As clinicians with access to resources to provide comprehensive interventions to patients with rare or neglected diseases, and the ability to report on our successes and failures in doing so, we have a responsibility to share these experiences so that others may build on them.",

By sharing these experiences in forums that are accessible to other clinicians in low- and middle-income countries, and providing those clinicians with an opportunity to share their experiences with us, this is a direct opportunity to influence the organization and delivery of care globally, and is an opportunity that we all must embrace.",
