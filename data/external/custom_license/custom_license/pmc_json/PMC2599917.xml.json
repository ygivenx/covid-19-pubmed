But Gregg (or Mike, as just about everyone at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] called him) grew up to become not only an epidemiologist but also a teacher, a mentor, a friend, and for many the embodiment of Lumsden\u2019s ideal (Figure). Among the many hundreds of students Gregg taught and influenced at the National Institutes of Health, and most notably at CDC, are countless leaders in epidemiology, public health, and the biomedical sciences. They practice all over the country, in health departments, in universities, in federal agencies, and indeed around the world. Roger Bernier, an epidemiologist who trained under Gregg at CDC, has compared Gregg\u2019s professional approach to one of his hobbies: gardening. He planted, he nurtured, and he took care of and kept an eye on things; as the garden flourished, he kept it in bloom by careful but unobtrusive attention, preventive maintenance, and teaching and inspiring others to pitch in and help.",

Between the mid-1960s and 1990, when he retired from CDC, Mike was often in the eye of the hurricane, presiding as deputy director over CDC\u2019s Bureau of Epidemiology during many of the most memorable outbreak investigations of the past century. These included Pontiac fever/Legionnaires\u2019 disease (1968/1976), swine flu (1975\u20131976), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (1977), Ebola fever in Sudan and Zaire (1976), and AIDS (1981). He also helped put on the epidemiology map such new diseases as Reye syndrome (1973\u20131977), Kawasaki disease (1977), and toxic-shock syndrome (1980). And he helped steer us into an era of control (and future eradication) of such vaccine-preventable diseases as measles and poliomyelitis.",

If this were not enough, Mike described it all in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), put out in the pithy, painfully unambiguous, \u201cjust-the-facts-ma\u2019am\u201d style he perfected. As an unintentional by-product of his editorial skills, he turned hundreds\u2014perhaps thousands\u2014of epidemiologists into decent medical writers and editors, instilling in them the idea that good writing is not only a result of, but also a path to, the kind of clear thinking needed in epidemiologic practice. Anne Mather, managing editor of the MMWR for 7 years under Mike\u2019s leadership in the 1970s and 1980s, notes that his mantra for editing, \u201cThis is getting into the thick of thin things,\u201d is advice she still follows, and quotes, today.",

He was my first boss and already something of a legend. He taught us by making us apprentices in everything he did, including participation in countless \u201ccurbside\u201d discussions of epidemics, methods, publications, theories, and epidemic history. The discussions were often conducted on the run, carried on from office to office like a movable feast, spilling into hallways, migrating to the cafeteria, or even the library.

He had encyclopedic recall of past CDC outbreak investigations, perhaps because he had been involved in supervising many of them, reading and editing the \u201cEpi-2\u201d reports, and then publishing write-ups in the MMWR. The day we learned of an outbreak of respiratory disease among American Legionnaires in Philadelphia, Mike was having lunch in the CDC cafeteria with 3 young EIS officers (me among them), each of us less than a month on the job. Everyone was excited: obviously, something really big was happening. But, as is usually the case, information was dribbling in sporadically, incompletely, and with maddening imprecision. After listening to his young colleagues speculate a bit, Mike calmly reflected on whether this could be \u201cthe big one,\u201d return of a 1918-like influenza pandemic presaged by the swine flu outbreak earlier that year. He ran through the old and the recent history of influenza and other epidemic respiratory diseases, calling up all sorts of experiences completely new to us, commenting on what we (Pennsylvania health officials and CDC) needed to look for, what facts would be for and against influenza, what we needed to do next, and so on. I was thrilled. On ward rounds only a few weeks beforehand, I was now suddenly in the middle of a national epidemic, having lunch with one of the nation\u2019s top epidemiologists, learning about fascinating things I had not imagined last month. \u201cYes!\u201d I thought, \u201cThis epidemiology thing is what I want to do from now on.\u201d Many others had similar epiphanies.",

Peering up shyly over his glasses, held midway down the bridge of his nose, he would look down at the floor for a minute and then begin so softly that those in the back would have to strain to hear. \u201cFirst,\u201d he would say, \u201cyou need to find a good map...\u201d Then, in a slow build-up of pragmatic and mundane steps, he would walk us through an outbreak, taking care to omit none of those boringly essential details that seemed too obvious to mention. His unstated message was clear and powerful. This isn\u2019t medical school. Memorizing the Krebs cycle, the cranial nerves, and the entire Washington Manual won\u2019t get you through an outbreak investigation. You are now a detective, and you have to go about investigating the scene of the \u201caccident\u201d in \u201creal time,\u201d with little opportunity to research or look things up, keeping an open and inquisitive mind, remaining flexible and creative, always rethinking things, backtracking and verifying when necessary, being thorough but also moving quickly to assemble all of the puzzle pieces that seek to become a coherent picture.",

In epidemiologic investigations, there was no time for elegance and perfection. Epidemiology helped real people with real problems. As Michael O\u2019Leary, another of Mike\u2019s former epidemiology students, paraphrased him: \u201cIt\u2019s better to be approximately right today than exactly right tomorrow.\u201d Were Mike Gregg standing in Golden Square in 1854, he would have been impressed less by John Snow\u2019s brilliant reasoning than by Snow\u2019s ability to get the Broad Street pump handle removed quickly, thereby saving more lives.",

His door was always open, no matter how low on the totem pole you might be; but if he needed to see you, he popped into your office rather than asking you to come to his. In conversation he valued and respected the ideas of even the newest of neophytes. He listened more than he spoke; and when he did speak, it was softly and courteously, tentatively offering up his own thoughts on the subject, as if this were a democratic effort, rather than the boss telling you how things really were. He embraced teamwork as the professional norm and ignored, without discounting or disparaging it, individual accomplishment. His modesty was genuine; his gentleness, memorable. He walked the halls with his head aimed shyly down, moving so close to the cinderblock wall that you expected him to bump into it at any moment, occasionally lifting his shoulder to avoid just such an accident, dressed casually and in a manner that never telegraphed his stature, his slightly battered Hush Puppies pressing silently on linoleum floors.

If he became irritated or impatient, which happened only rarely, there might appear a quick gleam in his eyes, but any anger he felt dissipated quickly. In more than 30 years, I never heard him raise his voice above a moderate level.

Like everything else about him, his humor was understated. One example comes to mind. Gracious hosts, he and his wife, Lila, sometimes opened their home to the annual picnics for incoming EIS officers and their families. On the first of these I attended, in 1976, I remember him relating, with a seriousness that may well have been intentionally hilarious (I could never be sure), the story of a scandalous, and possibly apocryphal, EIS-picnic-from-hell of some years past. In Mike\u2019s telling, someone on the CDC staff had gotten a not-so-bright idea for a training exercise: put methylene blue dye in one of the foods at the EIS picnic and, when the results were discovered, send the EIS officers off on an outbreak investigation to identify the food source. Apparently, however, when spouses and children began urinating blue liquid into their home toilets, a few among them were more alarmed than amused, and the exercise had to be abandoned. Mike told this story dryly but with a twinkle in his eye, as if to say \u201cWhat a dumb thing to do (but wasn\u2019t it a great idea for an epidemic\u2014more than \u2018eleven blue men\u2019 [3] but women and children too?\u201d).",

Remembering his Parisian birth, I replied in kind, then asked how he had come to be born in France. His father had worked there at the Rockefeller\u2019s European office, he said, continuing on with a few remembrances about the man. I had vaguely remembered hearing about his famous father, but Mike\u2019s recollections were about a beloved \u201cDad,\u201d not a famous man.
