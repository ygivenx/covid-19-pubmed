            "text": "Back in 1928, Alexander Fleming1 began the microbial drug era when he discovered in a Petri dish seeded with Staphylococcus aureus that a compound produced by a mold killed the bacteria. The mold, identified as Penicillium notatum, produced an active agent that was named penicillin. Later, penicillin was isolated as a yellow powder and used as a potent antibacterial compound during World War II. By using Fleming's method, other naturally occurring substances, such as chloramphenicol and streptomycin, were isolated. Naturally occurring antibiotics are produced by fermentation, an old technique that can be traced back almost 8000 years, initially for beverages and food production. Beer is one of the world's oldest beverages, produced from barley by fermentation, possibly dating back to the sixth millennium BC and recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Another old fermentation, used to initiate the koji process, was that of rice by Aspergillus oryzae. During the past 4000 years, Penicillium roqueforti has been utilized for cheese production, and for the past 3000 years soy sauce in Asia and bread in Egypt has represented examples of traditional fermentations.2",

However, the development of resistance in microbes and tumor cells has become a major problem and requires much research effort to combat it.",

Applications of chemically synthesized natural metabolites include the use of a natural product derived from plant salicyclic acid derivatives present in white willow, wintergreen and meadowsweet to relieve pain and suffering. Concoctions of these plants were administered by Hippocrates back in the year 500 BC, and even earlier in Egypt and Babylonia, for fever, pain and childbirth. Synthetic salicylates were produced initially by Bayer in 1874, and later in 1897, Arthur Eichengrun at Bayer discovered that an acetyl derivative (aspirin), reduced acidity, bad taste and stomach irritation. These plant-based systems continue to play an essential role in health care, and it has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) that approximately 80% of the world's inhabitants rely mainly on traditional medicines for their primary health care.5",

During the twentieth century, massive programs to synthesize quinoline derivatives, based on the quinine prototype, were carried out. The first of the new quinolones to be used clinically as an antibacterial agent was nalidixic acid, which emerged as part of a large chemical synthesis program developed at the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute.8, 9 The program was begun when 7-chloro-1,4-dihydro-1-ethyl-4-oxoquinolone-3-carboxylic acid was obtained as a side product during purification of chloroquine and found to have antibacterial activity. The best compound found in the program was nalidixic acid, which had remarkable activity against Gram-negative bacteria and was shown to be an inhibitor of DNA gyrase. Its discovery led to a whole series of synthetic quinolone and fluoroquinolone antibiotics (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, etc.), which have been very successful in medicine and have achieved major commercial success (Table 1). It is important to appreciate that all quinolones, though synthetic, are based on the structure of the natural plant product quinine.",

            "text": "Table 1 shows that, among the anti-infective drugs, antivirals represent more than 20% of the market. Two antivirals that are chemically synthesized today were originally isolated from marine organisms. They are acyclovir (active against the herpes virus by inhibition and inactivation of DNA polymerase) and cytarabine (active against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Both compounds are nucleoside analog drugs, originally isolated from sponges.12 Other antiviral applications of natural compounds are related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. In the pathogenesis of this disease, HIV-1, similar to other retroviruses, depends on its stable integration into the host genome to facilitate efficient replication of the viral RNA and maintenance of the infected state. Therefore, de novo viral DNA synthesized during reverse transcription is immediately integrated into the host cell DNA (through the integration step), allowing for further transcription of viral RNA. In the late phase of HIV viral replication, the large precursor polyprotein (gag-pol precursor, Pr 160) must be appropriately cleaved by a viral protease. The cleavage of the gag precursor protein of HIV is critical for the maturation and infectivity of the viral particle. Without the appropriate cleavage of the precursor polyproteins, non-infectious viral particles are generally produced. To confront this problem, a tremendous effort has been made at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), in search of natural metabolites capable of inhibiting HIV reverse transcriptase and HIV protease. Chemically synthesized derivatives of these compounds are the main agents now used against HIV. Furthermore, reports have been published on natural product inhibitors of HIV integrase obtained from among the marine ascidian alkaloids; that is, the lamellarins (produced by the mollusk Lamellaria sp.), and from terrestrial plants (Baccharis genistelloides and Achyrocline satureioides). The most consistent anti-HIV activity was observed with extracts prepared from several Baccharis species.13 In addition, NCI has been evaluating the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of pepstatin A, a small pentapeptide produced by several Streptomyces species. It contains a unique hydroxyamino acid, statine, that sterically blocks the active site of HIV-1 protease.14, 15",

            "text": "New antibiotics that are active against resistant bacteria are required. Bacteria have lived on the Earth for several billion years. During this time, they encountered in nature a wide range of naturally occurring antibiotics. To survive, bacteria developed antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Therefore, it is not surprising that they have become resistant to most of the natural antimicrobial agents that have been developed over the past 50 years.16 This resistance increasingly limits the effectiveness of current antimicrobial drugs. The problem is not just antibiotic resistance but also multidrug resistance. In 2004, more than 70% of pathogenic bacteria were estimated to be resistant to at least one of the currently available antibiotics.17 The so-called \u2018superbugs\u2019 (organisms that are resistant to most of the clinically used antibiotics) are emerging at a rapid rate. S. aureus, which is resistant to methicillin, is responsible for many cases of infections each year. The incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is increasing. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) reported in 2004 that in US hospitals alone, around 2 million people acquire bacterial infections each year (http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=4682). S. aureus is responsible for half of the hospital-associated infections and takes the lives of approximately 100 000 patients each year in the USA alone.18 The bacteria produce a biofilm in which they are encased and protected from the environment. Biofilms can grow on wounds, scar tissues and medical implants or devices, such as joint prostheses, spinal instrumentations, catheters, vascular prosthetic grafts and heart valves. More than 70% of the bacterial species producing such biofilms are likely to be resistant to at least one of the drugs commonly used in anti-infectious therapy.14 In hospitals, there are also other examples of Gram-positive (Enterococcus and Streptococcus) and Gram-negative pathogens (Klebsiella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, Salmonella and Pseudomonas); these hospital-inhabiting microbes are called \u2018nosocomial bacteria.\u2019 More than 60% of sepsis cases in hospitals are caused by Gram-negative bacteria.14 Among them, Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounts for almost 80% of these opportunistic infections. They represent a serious problem in patients hospitalized with cancer, cystic fibrosis and burns, causing death in 50% of cases. Other infections caused by Pseudomonas species include endocarditis, pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, central nervous system, wounds, eyes, ears, skin and musculoskeletal system. This bacterium is another example of a natural multidrug-resistant microorganism. Although many strains are susceptible to gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, resistant forms have also developed. These multidrug-resistant bacteria make hospitals \u201cdangerous places to be, especially if you are sick, but even if not.\u201d19",

At least 30 new diseases emerged in the 1980s and 1990s and they are growing in incidence. Emerging infectious organisms often encounter hosts with no prior exposure to them and thus represent a novel challenge to the host's immune system. Several viruses responsible for human epidemics have made a transition from animal host to humans and are now transmitted from human to human. HIV, responsible for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, is one example. Although it has not been proven, it is suspected that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus, also evolved from a different species.20",

In this case, the infection is acquired from the bite of ticks belonging to several species of the genus Ixodes. Borrelia burgdorferi is the predominant cause of Lyme disease in the US, whereas Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are implicated in most European cases. The disease presentation varies widely, and may include a rash and flu-like symptoms in its initial stage, followed by musculoskeletal, arthritic, neurologic, psychiatric and cardiac manifestations. In the majority of cases, symptoms can be eliminated with antibiotics, especially if the treatment begins early in the course of illness. However, late or inadequate treatment can lead to \u2018late-stage\u2019 Lyme disease that can be disabling and difficult to treat.21 (v) Other evolving pathogens include the Escherichia coli 0157:H7 (enterohemorrhagic E. coli), a strain that causes colitis and bloody diarrhea by producing a toxin called Shiga toxin, which damages the intestines. It is estimated that this bacterium causes infection in more than 70 000 patients a year in the USA. Another example is (vi) Cryptosporidium, an obligate intracellular parasite commonly found in lakes and rivers. Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the common species affecting the digestive and respiratory organs. Intestinal cryptosporidiosis is characterized by severe watery diarrhea. Pulmonary and tracheal cryptosporidiosis in humans is associated with coughing and is frequently a low-grade fever. People with severely weakened immune systems are likely to have more severe and more persistent symptoms than healthy individuals.",

Micafungin is licensed for clinical use in Asian countries and in the US. This compound exhibits extremely potent antifungal activity against clinically important fungi, including Aspergillus and azole-resistant strains of Candida.

It is available as an oral suspension and has a favorable toxicity profile. The wide spectrum of posaconazole activity in in vitro studies, animal models and preliminary clinical studies suggests that it represents an important addition to the antifungal armamentarium.41",

Anthracyclines act by intercalating DNA strands, which result in a complex formation that inhibits the synthesis of DNA and RNA. It also triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. In their cytotoxic effects, the binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins plays an important role. Their main adverse effects are heart damage (cardiotoxicity), which considerably limits their usefulness, and vomiting. The first anthracycline discovered was daunorubicin (daunomycin) in 1966, which is produced naturally by Streptomyces peucetius. Doxorubicin (adriamycin) was developed in 1967. Another anthracycline is epirubicin. This compound, approved by the FDA in 1999, is favored over doxorubicin in some chemotherapy regimens as it appears to cause fewer side effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4\u2032 carbon of the sugar, which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas. Valrubicin is a semisynthetic analog of doxorubicin approved as a chemotherapeutic drug in 1999 and used to treat bladder cancer.",

Cyclosporins are a family of neutral, highly lipophilic, cyclic undecapeptides containing some unusual amino acids, synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. Discovery of the immunosuppressive activity led to its use in heart, liver and kidney transplants and to the overwhelming success of the organ transplant field.80 Cyclosporin was approved for use in 1983. It is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. This complex of cyclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin, which under normal circumstances is responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin-2. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and therefore leads to a reduced function of effector T cells. Sales of cyclosporin A have reached US$1.5 billion per year.",

It is a macrolide, first discovered in 1975 as a product of S. hygroscopicus, and was initially proposed as an antifungal agent. However, this was abandoned when it was discovered that it had potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. This compound binds to the immunophilin FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), and this binary complex interacts with the rapamycin-binding domain and inactivates a serine-threonine kinase termed the mammalian target of rapamycin. The latter is known to control proteins that regulate mRNA translation initiation and G1 progression.81 The antiproliferative effect of rapamycin has also been used in conjunction with coronary stents to prevent restenosis, which usually occurs after the treatment of coronary artery disease by balloon angioplasty. Rapamycin also shows promise in treating tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a congenital disorder that leaves sufferers prone to benign tumor growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin and other organs. In a study of rapamycin as a treatment for TSC, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers observed a major improvement in mice regarding retardation related to autism.82",

Parasites are organisms that inhabit the body and benefit from a prolonged, close association with the host. Antiparasitics are compounds that inhibit the growth or reproduction of a parasite; some antiparasitics directly kill parasites. In general, parasites are much smaller than their hosts, show a high degree of specialization for their mode of life and reproduce more quickly and in greater numbers than their hosts. Classic examples of parasitism include the interactions between vertebrate hosts and such diverse animals as tapeworms, flukes, Plasmodium species and fleas. Parasitic infections can cause potentially serious health problems and even kill the host. Parasites mainly enter the body through the mouth, usually through ingestion of tainted food or drink. This is a very common problem in tropical areas, but is not limited to those regions. There are 3200 varieties of parasites in four major categories: Protozoa, Trematoda, Cestoda and Nematoda. The major groups include protozoans (organisms having only one cell) and parasitic worms (helminths). Each of these can infect the digestive tract, and sometimes two or more can cause infection at the same time. The WHO reported that approximately 25% of the world's population is infected with roundworms. In addition, a major agricultural problem has been the infection of farm animals by worms.",

The Streptomyces avermitilis culture, isolated by \u014cmura and coworkers at the Kitasato Institute in Japan,104 produced a family of secondary metabolites (eight compounds) with both antihelmintic and insecticidal activities.

It is well recognized that when prescribed, either intravenously or orally, it causes side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.

This makes this antibiotic very attractive to be used in ill patients with gastrointestinal motility problems. There have been some developments on erythromycin analogs that lack antibiotic action but retain action at motilin receptors. These have been named \u2018motilides.\u2019118, 119 Recently, an orally active erythromycin-derived motilin receptor agonist (mitemcinal) has been tested in patients with idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis. In both cases, an improvement of gastroparetic symptoms was observed.120",

            "text": "The 80-year contribution of microorganisms to medicine and agriculture has been overwhelming. However, antibiotic resistance in microbes has created a dangerous situation and the need for new antibiotics is clear. Unfortunately, most of the large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antimicrobial compounds. Owing to the economics, they have concluded that drugs directed against chronic diseases offer a better revenue stream than do antimicrobial agents, as for the latter the length of treatment is short and government restriction is likely. Some small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing antibiotics, but most depend on venture capital rather than sales income, and with the present regulations, they face huge barriers to enter the market. These barriers were raised with the best intentions of ensuring public safety, but will have the opposite effect if they terminate antibiotic development while resistance continues to increase.121 However, there are some bright possibilities. One of the most promising is the utilization of uncultivated microorganisms. Considering that 99% of the bacteria and 95% of the fungi have not been cultivated in the laboratory, putting efforts into finding means to grow such microorganisms are proceeding and succeeding.122 Furthermore, researchers are now extracting bacterial DNA from soil and marine habitats, cloning large fragments into, for example, bacterial artificial chromosomes, expressing in a host bacterium and screening the library for new antibiotics. This metagenomic effort is allowing access to a vast untapped reservoir of genetic and metabolic diversity,123, 124 which could result in the discovery of new and useful natural products.125 In addition to these two relatively new techniques, the chemical and biological modification of old antibiotics could still supply new and powerful drugs. These comments also apply to non-antibiotics such as antitumor agents and other microbial products.",
