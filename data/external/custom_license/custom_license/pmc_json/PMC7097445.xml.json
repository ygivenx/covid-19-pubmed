But I did my postdoc with George Whitesides at Harvard in applied enzymology, so that was a bit of a mixture of biology and chemistry. Then I worked on molecular biology at Genentech, and at Gilead I started in research but then took over responsibility for preclinical development, dealing with everything from pharmacology and in vitro metabolism to ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and toxicology. In 1999 I took over the development side of things at Gilead, and since then I've spent most of my time working on development issues. So I used to be a chemist a long time ago, but I've actually now worked on everything except for product pricing and commercialization.",

Sometimes I see people working on elegant biology problems, but in order to make a product you have to get more than just the biology right. You have to get the chemistry right as well. And sometimes I look at a molecule and say, this is hopeless. Another thing that I think is often underappreciated is the manufacturing side of chemistry. We learned a lot with Tamiflu (oseltamivir). The starting material for that synthesis was extremely expensive, so we had to look for other starting materials and that led us to the Chinese spice star anise. But it took us a lot of work to get there.",

We call this the kick-and-kill approach. The challenge with HIV infection is that the virus hides in non-replicating CD4+ T cells. If you can kick these cells to wake them up, so to speak, then the virus will start reproducing, which kills the cell. And if subjects are well controlled on antivirals, then the virus can't go anywhere. We are looking at using a TLR7 agonist to deliver the kick, and a broadly neutralizing antibody to help control the awakened virus.",

We looked at immuno-oncology, and decided it's an extremely competitive space and that we don't really have anything to offer there. We looked at targeted therapies, and didn't really find anything that was scientifically interesting enough and reasonable in terms of commercial pricing. And then we decided on cell therapy. The data that both Novartis and Kite have generated is really incredible. And we think chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have the potential to be further expanded into other B cell malignancies, into earlier lines of therapy and ultimately even into solid tumours.

The problem they had was with volume; there were so many patients that immediately wanted to go into treatment, and there just wasn't the money in the system to pay for it all at once.
