These respiratory viruses can co-circulate in Egyptian chicken farms. Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious disease causing a high mortality rate (70\u2013100%) in avian species. NDV is a negative sense, single-stranded, monopartite RNA virus of the Avian Paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1). NDV strains have been categorized according to virulence as lentogenic, mesogenic, and velogenic strains. Velogenic strains are the most virulent, causing respiratory tract lesions as well as sever hemorrhagic lesions in the digestive tract (viscerotropic), and/or neurological signs (neurotropic). The lentogenic strains have low virulence and are common among domestic poultry [1, 2].",

In contrast to PCR, it uses only one constant temperature. The amplification step depends first on a recombinase (UvsX and co-factor UvsY from T4 Enterobacteria phage) binding to specific primers followed by scanning the DNA for the complementary sequence. Once invasion of the strand is maintained by the single strand binding protein (T4 gp32), a primer extension is ensued via a strand displacing DNA polymerase (Staphylococcus aureus) [14\u201318]. Lateral flow immunoassays are currently widely used due to their simplicity, low cost, good specificity, rapid result, electricity-free operation and long shelf life, making them suitable for on-site pathogen detection particularly in developing countries [19]. RPA combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) detection of amplicons has been previously reported for H9 subtype of avian influenza virus detection in Central China and proved to be appropriate for field application [20].",
