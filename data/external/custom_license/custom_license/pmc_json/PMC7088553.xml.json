As far as is known, this outbreak was not due to the deliberate release of the SARS-CoV coronavirus, but rather was a naturally occurring event. The appearance of SARS seems to have involved: (1) a zoonotic origin for SARS-CoV [e.g., horseshoe bats and/or Chiroptera as one wildlife reservoir (Janies et al. 2008)]; (2) transmission to intermediate hosts [e.g., civet cats, racoon dogs (Feng and Gao 2007)]; (3) human contact with these intermediate hosts in Southern China (Guangdong Province, November 2002) and subsequent cross-species transmission of the coronavirus to humans (Feng and Gao 2007); (4) transmission of the virus through both non-hospital personal contact and hospital staff contact (Zhang 2007); and (5) global transmission of the virus via travelers from affected regions in Asia to other countries. SARS was eventually controlled through increased hygienic measures (e.g., face mask protection, frequent hand washing, living quarter disinfection), travel restrictions, and quarantine.",

During this outbreak, more than 8000 cases were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), with a case fatality rate of approximately 10% (Hao et al. 2006).",

The SARS Epidemiology/Clinical Medicine category focuses on controlling the spread of infection both in the treatment facility and in the larger local and global population, as well as clinical diagnosis and treatment of SARS. The SARS Biology category focuses on identifying and determining the structure of the SARS coronavirus, and identifying mechanisms and developing drugs for inhibiting the replication of the SARS coronavirus. The boundaries between the two categories are relatively sharp, reflecting the quality of the clustering approach used.\n",
