The hypervariable region within S1 is associated with some of the antigenic differences, being the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies, and may also be associated with host range and tissue tropism. Most of the differences in S1 occur between virulent and non-virulent strains [16]. The hypervariable S1 genomic region has been widely used to study the genetic variability and evolution of the virus, including the few studies on molecular characterization of BCoV strains conducted in the South American region [17\u201319].",

A survey conducted to collect information about management and problems associated with dairy cattle farming (the farms were randomly selected and representative of the dairy area in southwestern Uruguay) and the intensive production system facilitated the collection of a large number of samples (782). On the other hand, beef cattle sampling was carried out by personal contact with farmers in order to encompass as many departments (geographic regions) as possible, but the extensive production system of beef cattle in Uruguay hindered access to the samples (42), and this is a limitation of this work.

Combinations of molecular clocks (strict, relaxed lognormal and relaxed exponential) and coalescent tree priors (constant, exponential, and skyline) were evaluated using Bayes factors. The uncorrelated relaxed with exponential distribution molecular clock and the Bayesian Skyline coalescent model were selected, and the country location was used as a trait for the phylogeographic analysis. The Markov chain Monte Carlo length was 200 million generations, obtaining 10,000 parameters samples. Effective sample size (ESS) was evaluated in Tracer v1.6.0, and ESS values higher than 200 for all parameters were accepted.",

In addition, dairy cattle are concentrated in the southwest region of the country, whereas beef cattle are dispersed throughout the rest of the country [7]. Despite the difference in sampling, we considered the inclusion of beef cattle samples relevant, but the results should be interpreted with caution.

There is evidence that the latter goal is not being met in Uruguay [30]; however, vaccination against NCD is a strategy used to enhance host immunity (48% of the calves in dairy farms in this study were born to vaccinated dams, Table 1). Interestingly, we observed that vaccination of the dam was associated with a reduced likelihood of BCoV being detected in the calves. It is important to clarify that the information collected about vaccination in this study refers to vaccination against NCD and not specifically against BCoV, and although most vaccines include a strain of BCoV, there are some exceptions. Therefore, the impact of vaccines on the reduction of BCoV needs to be investigated further. On the other hand, BCoV detection was higher in dead calves with diarrhea than in live calves (although not statistically significant), in concordance with previous data [31].",

While the frequency of BCoV detection was higher from the third week of age, the higher frequency of BCoV detection in diarrheic calves than in non-diarrheic calves was only observed in the first week of life. Colostral antibodies persist in calves for approximately 3 weeks, and between the third and fourth week of age, antibody titers from passive transfer are low, and the calf is just beginning to mount its own antibody responses to environmental microbiota [32]. The higher frequency of BCoV detection in the third and fourth weeks of age in our study might correspond to this decline in colostral immunity. On the other hand, the only age group with a higher BCoV detection rate in diarrheic samples than in non-diarrheic samples was the first week of age, in agreement with previous studies in which the susceptibility of calves to NCD caused by BCoV was found to be higher in the first days of life [33\u201336].",

Since BCoV is more stable at lower temperatures and lower levels of ultraviolet light [37], this might be a reason why BCoV is most frequently detected in winter [38, 39]. In Uruguay, according to the Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (INUMET), in June, July and August (in addition to the temperature), the time of direct insolation, the vapor pressure, and the cumulative rainfall are also lower than in the other months, and the average relative humidity and the atmospheric pressure are higher than in the remainder of the months. Therefore, although we focused on the average temperature in this report, some (or all) of the above-mentioned factors could have been involved in the higher detection rate of BCoV in those three months. The higher frequency of BCoV detection in winter may be due to cattle shedding the virus year after year in the winter months, as the incidence of coronavirus shedding in non-vaccinated cows that delivered in the winter months has been reported to increase at parturition [38]. Calves born to BCoV carrier dams have a significantly higher risk of developing BCoV-induced diarrhea due to periparturient exposure from fecal contamination, and if calves are raised in groups, transmission between them is expected [31, 38, 40, 41].",

In this regard, the strains detected in this study are divergent from the Mebus strain, as observed in the phylogenetic analysis, and nine amino acid differences were observed between the Uruguayan strains and Mebus. Four of these differences (together with several nucleotide changes, not shown), are associated with divergence between the Uruguayan lineages, although both appear to have entered to Uruguay in the same year and from neighboring countries. Surveillance is necessary to determine if vaccine strains are still effective against the new variants that are emerging, and if strains are found to have antigenic differences, they should be studied and possibly included in the vaccine formulations. Uruguayan BCoV strains that diverged from the Mebus strain were found to cluster with the Argentinean isolate Arg95. Mebus-induced neutralizing antibodies were capable of neutralizing the Arg95 strain and vice versa, indicating that the aa differences were not enough to establish a new serotype [18]. It is worth mentioning that some strains (56%, 34/60) could not be amplified by conventional PCR, despite the fact that they were detected in positive samples by real-time PCR, which could be explained by a difference in the sensitivity of the methods and/or possible mutations in the primer regions.",

One of the lineages entered from Argentina, and the other entered from Brazil, and both lineages entered in the same year (2013), which strongly suggests that there are biosecurity shortcomings leading to the transboundary spread of BCoV between these countries. However, factors that may have led to the introduction of these two viral lineages in the same year from two neighboring countries remain largely unknown. The substitution rate estimated in this analysis was 1.39 \u00d7 10\u22123 s/s/y, faster than previous estimates: 6.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 s/s/y [44] and 8.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 s/s/y [45]. Both previous analyses were carried out using complete S gene sequences (the first together with other betacoronavirus 1), while in our analysis, partial S genome sequences corresponding to a hypervariable region were used, which is expected to show a faster evolutionary rate and could explain this difference. The MRCA of the BCoV lineages circulating in South America was dated to 1987, and both lineages have been circulating for approximately 20 years on this continent: one of them in Argentina since 1992, and the other in Brazil since 2000, both spreading later to Uruguay. Based on our analyses, since the entry of BCoV lineages into South America, the population size seems to have been constant, although low fluctuations can be observed.",

Accession numbers of Uruguayan strains related to Argentinian and Brazilian strains are shown in red and green, respectively. The Mebus strain sequence was used as a reference. Numbers above the amino acid sequence indicate the position of the complete spike sequence of strain Mebus (accession number: U00735). Dots indicate conserved positions, and amino acid changes are represented using the corresponding one-letter symbol. Positions with more than 80% of strains containing differences are indicated by squares. Red, 100% of Uruguayan strains different from Mebus; orange, > 75% of Uruguayan strains different from Mebus; pink, > 50% of Uruguayan strains different from Mebus; dark blue, 100% of strains with differences between lineages; in light blue, > 50% of strains with differences between lineages, black, and other changes",
