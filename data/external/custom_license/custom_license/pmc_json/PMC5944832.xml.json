The molecular consequences of chemical exposure can therefore also vary across individuals and populations and may be attributable to variation in the expression of key metabolic genes, in the immune response, and in the DNA damage response pathway. Emerging evidence also suggests that chemical-induced effects may be transmitted transgenerationally through epigenetic means (Nadeau 2009). Yet, the underlying mechanisms for how genetics, metabolism, gene expression, and gene regulation combinatorially dictate the response to chemical exposure both within and across individuals is poorly understood.",

There have been four studies on the carcinogenicity of 1,3-butadiene exposure by inhalation in mice, all conducted in the same F1 hybrid mouse strain, B6C3F1 (IARC 2008). These studies showed that 1,3-butadiene induced tumors in multiple organs in this strain at exposure concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 1,250 ppm and durations of exposure from 13 to 60wk. Similar systematic carcinogenicity studies have not been performed in other mouse strains.",

These DNA-reactive epoxide intermediates are initially processed through phase I metabolism (bioactivation) by cytochrome P450 oxidases and later conjugated and excreted through phase II metabolism (detoxification) by broad-specificity enzymes including glutathione S-transferases (Csan\u00e1dy et al. 1992).",

Interestingly, these 1,3-butadiene\u2013induced effects were found to vary across genetically divergent inbred mouse strains (Koturbash et al. 2011a). In particular, C57BL/6J (a Mus musculus domesticus subspecies and a classic laboratory strain) exhibited high levels of DNA adduct formation and changes in bulk histone modifications, whereas CAST/EiJ (a M. musculus castaneus subspecies and a wild-derived strain) exhibited relatively low levels of DNA adduct formation and bulk histone modifications.

A minimum of a 10-base overlap and a maximum of one base mismatch were allowed in the adapter sequence, and any reads separated by 65 nucleotides (nt) or fewer were merged.

Paired-end (50 bp) sequencing was performed (Illumina HiSeq 2500; see Excel Table S1). Reads were quality-filtered (score of \u226520 in at least 90% of nucleotides), adapters removed, and aligned to appropriate reference genomes [C57BL/6: NCBI Build 37; CAST/EiJ: Build 37 pseudogenome (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=Pseudo)] using GSNAP software (Wu and Nacu 2010) and RefSeq splice site annotations. \u201cMod\u201d files included with the CAST/EiJ pseudogenome that detail the basepair transformations were used to create the CAST/EiJ pseuodgenome from the C57BL/6J reference genome. RefSeq gene annotations were created for the CAST/EiJ genome by mapping C57BL/6J RefSeq annotations to the pseudogenome using a reversed mod file created from the mod file available for the pseudogenome. Certain types of genomic regions are known to induce artefactual signal caused by experimental or technical biases; thus, it has been suggested that these regions be masked or ignored (Carroll et al. 2014). Mouse blacklists were therefore created in a fashion consistent with ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) (ENCODE Project Consortium 2012) for the human genome, including problematic satellite repetitive elements (CENSAT, GSAT, MurSAT, and SYNREP, as defined by RepeatMasker), regions with sequence homology to mitochondrial DNA (NumtS), rRNA, and regions on the X chomosome (chrX) with strong sequence homology to the Y chromosome (chrY). A CAST/EiJ pseudogenome blacklist file was generated in the same way after generating RepeatMasker annotations and using BLAT to get the sequence homology pieces (NumtS, chrX/Y). Postalignment quantification of reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values was conducted using an in-house script with RefSeq gene annotations.",

These ranked gene lists and their associated weights {[(1\u2013FDR)\u00d7log FC]/abs(log FC), where FDR represents the FDR value for each gene, FC represents the fold change, and log is the natural log} were used as input to GSAASeqSP.

For each pathway, signi\ufb01cance is represented by color, and occupancy (number of genes in the pathway) is represented by the size of the bubble.

Pathway enrichment analysis indicated the up-regulation of seven pathways (FDR< 10%), the most significant of which was glutathione conjugation, a critical phase II metabolic pathway for the detoxification of exogenous xenobiotics such as 1,3-butadiene (Board and Menon 2013) (Figure 2; see also Excel Table S7). Down-regulated genes were enriched for a diverse set of pathways including those related to energy metabolism, hemostasis, and phase I metabolism (Figure 2; see also Excel Table S7). miRNA expression in CAST/EiJ mice was also largely unaffected by exposure, with only 10 miRNAs differentially expressed in exposed versus control mice (FDR< 10%; see Excel Table S4). No miRNA regulatory hubs were detected. Further, 1,3-butadiene exposure had no significant effect on the chromatin landscape, resulting in no detected differentially accessible regions. Together, these findings show that the transcriptional response of CAST/EiJ mice to 1,3-butadiene exposure is intertwined with detoxification of the chemical, as indicated by the substantial shift from phase I bioactivation to phase II detoxification pathways. The lack of chromatin and miRNA changes indicates that baseline gene regulatory programs in the CAST/EiJ strain are poised to mount a robust response to efficiently detoxify chemicals such as 1,3-butadiene.",

In contrast, 1,101 DARs exhibited greater accessibility in exposed mice and were enriched for both phase I bioactivation and phase II detoxification pathways (Figure 3C), such as within the glutathione S-transferase Gstp2 locus, a key enzyme in glutathione conjugation (Figure 3D) (Board and Menon 2013). Both sets of DARs were analyzed for transcription factor motif enrichment in regions proximal and distal to gene transcription start sites (see Figure S6). For DARs with increased accessibility following exposure, we observed significant enrichment of motifs for Mafk/Bach1, Dlx3 and Dbp. In contrast, in DARs with decreased accessibility following exposure, we detected enrichment of motifs for Egr4 and Sp1. In addition, Sp1 showed significantly decreased expression upon exposure (FDR=0.06; see also Excel Table S2).

We identified 2,188 proximal and 149 distal DARs that were significantly more accessible in C57BL/6J than in CAST/EiJ and that also contained an Sp1 motif. These C57BL/6J-enriched DARs, on average, showed decreased accessibility in C57BL/6J lung upon 1,3-butadiene exposure in proximal regions (Figure 4A), and to a lesser extent in distal regions (see Figure S7), whereas there was no change in the same regions in the lung of CAST/EiJ mice upon exposure. In addition, as noted above, Sp1 itself was significantly more highly expressed in C57BL/6J than in CAST/EiJ at baseline, and expression was significantly decreased in C57BL/6J upon exposure (see Excel Table S2), in concordance with the chromatin accessibility measures. Together, these suggest that Sp1 has a more prominent regulatory role in C57BL/6J that became repressed when these mice were exposed to 1,3-butadiene.",

For 719 genes linked to one of the 2,188 proximal DARs, we found that on average, these genes showed significantly increased expression in C57BL/6J relative to CAST/EiJ in control mice, and they showed decreased expression in C57BL/6J and no change in CAST/EiJ upon 1,3-butadiene exposure (Figure 4B). These 719 genes are enriched in immune response pathways, such as interferon signaling, as demonstrated by the interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7) locus (Figure 4C; see also Excel Table S9). Similarly, the 67 genes linked to one of the 149 distal DARs were expressed more highly in C57BL/6J at baseline and decreased in expression on exposure in only C57BL/6J mice (see Figure S6). Together, these findings suggest that Sp1 plays an important role in establishing the proinflammatory immune system state seen in clean air\u2013exposed C57BL/6J (but not CAST/EiJ) that may contribute to increased DNA damage; they also suggest that the removal of Sp1 by exposure to 1,3-butadiene is associated with a decrease in these immune-related pathways.",

To investigate this more broadly, we analyzed expression patterns across all genes and found that the majority of genes for which expression was affected by 1,3-butadiene exposure in C57BL/6J mice were directionally altered to more closely resemble expression levels in CAST/EiJ mice (Figure 5A; see also Excel Table S2). Nearly all of these genes could be divided into four groups. The first group contained 1,757 genes that were down-regulated in C57BL/6J upon exposure, thereby approximating the expression profile of CAST/EiJ (Figure 5A, Group 1), and was enriched for genes in the immune and hemostasis-related pathways (see Excel Table S10). The second group, containing 1,534 genes up-regulated in exposed C57BL/6J mice to better resemble CAST/EiJ, was enriched for genes in the phase II detoxification and DNA damage response pathways (Figure 5A, Group 2; see also Excel Table S10). These pathway enrichments were not surprising given our previous analysis of the C57BL/6J response to exposure (Figure 3A). In addition, we observed sets of 376 (Group 3) and 345 (Group 4) differentially expressed genes in exposed C57BL/6J mice in which expression in C57BL/6J diverged in direction compared with expression in CAST/EiJ. These genes were also enriched for pathways related to detoxification of 1,3-butadiene but included Phase I bioactivation pathways, which were absent in Group 2 (Figure 5A).",

This finding suggests a model (Figure 6) in which differences in susceptibility to DNA damage by environmental toxicants are largely dependent on the baseline activity of key genes and the corresponding chromatin environment. When expression and chromatin profiles are highly divergent from those necessary to efficiently combat these chemicals, DNA will incur increased damage as the necessary cellular reprogramming occurs.",

Including a larger panel of genetically diverse inbred mouse strains will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of how genetic variation dictates the response to and consequences of toxicant exposure. Assessing the level of DNA damage at a range of time points will help us better understand how quickly these molecular changes occur, if and when adaptation in the transcriptomic or chromatin response occurs after prolonged exposure, and how that adaptation (or the lack thereof) may affect the amount of damage incurred. Importantly, determining the persistence of these changes after an initial exposure will reveal whether there exists an epigenetic memory that may reduce the effects of future exposures.",
