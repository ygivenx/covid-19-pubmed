In Germany reimbursement of vaccination for all age groups has been implemented in several federal states to encourage vaccination rates.\n12\n This may explain the high coverage rates in Germany. A sub\u2010analysis of the data obtained in Great Britain showed that Wales reached a vaccination rate of 33\u00b73% in season 2005/06, higher than the German coverage rate (32\u00b75%).

In the elderly \u226565 years, the lowest coverage was observed in Germany and Italy and the highest in Great Britain. In Great Britain general practitioners are encouraged to recommend vaccination to eligible high\u2010risk patients, which may have contributed to the high vaccination rates in the target groups.\n9\n In Spain, vaccination coverage increased in those aged \u226560 after the age threshold of vaccination recommendations was reduced to age 60 in some communities.",
