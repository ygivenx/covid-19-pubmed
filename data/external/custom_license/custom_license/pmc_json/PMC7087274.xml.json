Moreover, PRRSV infection confers susceptibility to secondary infection by other viruses or bacteria. Vaccination is the most common prophylactic measure used to protect pigs against PRRSV infection. Currently, modified live virus (MLV) PRRSV vaccines are considered most effective although probably because of PRRSV genetic variation, MLV vaccines have failed to confer complete protection against drift variants [3, 4]. Thus, there is a need for novel antiviral drugs that could be used for prevention and control of PRRSV infection.",

Griffithsin is a domain-swapped dimer and each subunit has three nearly equivalent glycan-binding sites [6]. Griffithsin binds glycan moieties associated with the glycoproteins of several enveloped viruses [7], resulting in inhibition of infectivity. Griffithsin has been shown to exhibit significant antiviral activity against human enveloped viruses including HIV [5, 8], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [9], severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) [6, 10], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [11, 12], herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) [13] and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [14, 15]. Moreover, Griffithsin shows excellent thermostability [16], remaining stable up to 80\u00b0C, and is resistant to organic solvents [5] and protease degradation [17]. The cytotoxicity of Griffithsin has been studied extensively [18, 19], showing that it possesses a superior safety profile: no cytotoxicity was observed against a variety of cell types, nor any major effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation or cytokine and chemokine production. Thus, Griffithsin is an attractive candidate for development as an antiviral therapeutic.",

Then recombinant plasmid pUC57-Griffithsin was introduced into the NdeI\u2013XhoI digested pET-32a vector to obtain the recombinant expression plasmid pET-32a-Griffithsin. Competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the recombinant expression plasmid. Gene expression was carried out as described in the pET system manual (Novagen, USA). Briefly, a single colony from the recombinant E. coli strains was grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C in LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin and 20 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol. Then The overnight cultures were diluted in 400 mL of fresh LB broth at 37 \u00b0C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 1.0. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After further incubation for 24 h at 15 \u00b0C, the culture was harvested and resuspended in PBS. Then the cells were disrupted by high-pressure homogenization for two cycles. Finally, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 12000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and the resulting crude extract containing Griffithsin was applied to a 5 mL Ni2+-Sepharose HisTrap HPTM affinity column (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and eluted with 300 mM imidazole.

Since the HIV Env glycoprotein is heavily glycosylated containing up to 50% carbohydrate by weight [8, 32], this may explain Griffithsin\u2019s potent anti-HV activity. The antiviral properties of Griffithsin against enveloped viruses is thus likely to be related to the glycosylation of viral proteins, a hypothesis that should be further investigated by further studies.",

Millet and colleagues performed detailed studies to define the viral life cycle stage at which Griffithsin acted and found that Griffithsin inhibited MERS-CoV by acting on the adsorption stage [9]. By contrast, Griffithsin exhibited its antiviral activity against HSV-2 by preventing cell-to-cell spread, but had little effect on HSV-2 entry into target cells [33]. The reason for this difference may be related to the virus itself and its entry receptors. Further studies are needed to clarify the anti-PRRSV activity of Griffithsin in porcine alveolar macrophages, the main targets of PRRSV infection in vivo.",

Taking our own findings and the results of previous studies together, we inferred that the binding of Griffithsin to PRRSV glycoproteins prevented PRRSV attachment to target cells, possibly due to steric hindrance or loss of PRRSV receptor-binding ability. Previous studies revealed that Griffithsin reduced HIV, HCV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and JEV infectivity through binding to viral glycoproteins, thereby blocking viral entry. It was also confirmed that Griffithsin could bind to glycoprotein of HSV-2 and inhibited viral transmission by blocking cell-to-cell spread. Interestingly, Griffithsin also has antiviral activity against HPV, a non-enveloped virus, by binding to the secondary receptor \u03b16 integrin and decreasing its availability on the cell surface [7]. Due to the uncertain nature of the interactions between Griffithsin, PRRSV and host cells, its mode of action should be clarified in future studies.",
