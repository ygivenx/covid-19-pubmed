            "text": "Respiratory viral infections cause significant morbidity and misery, affecting millions of children annually worldwide. Although most infections are self-limiting and managed by the general practitioners, some children are seriously affected and require hospitalization [1\u20134]. These viruses account for a large workload in many of the pediatric departments in regional hospitals and are responsible for upper respiratory infections, croup, bronchiolitis and pneumonia [1\u201312]. Among these hospital admissions, a small percentage of children would require pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) support [13\u201317]. In 2003, there was extremely heightened awareness and surveillance of respiratory viral infections due to the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel corona virus (SARS-CoV) [4, 18\u201320]. Heightened surveillance and stricter personal hygiene could result in a lowered interpersonal spread of all respiratory viruses. Nevertheless, there has been a global concern for an influenza pandemic that might result in dramatic increase in mortality and morbidity in recent years. Such a real and present concern is witnessed in 2009 with the pandemic H1N1. The purpose of this study was to investigate if morbidity in young children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with a laboratory-proven diagnosis of influenza or parainfluenza infection had increased, and if the pandemic H1N1 in 2009 had resulted in a higher morbidity.",

Although there are ten government (Hospital Authority [HA]) and ten private hospitals providing general pediatric inpatient service, the HA system provides the majority of inpatient trauma care. The Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) is a university teaching hospital situated in the Eastern part of the New Territories in Hong Kong. PWH provides tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) service for children <12 years of age to this region with a catchment population of over 1.1 million (approximately 25% were children < 12 years of age). The criteria for PICU admissions include cardiopulmonary insufficiency/failure, neurological deterioration, and concerns of emergency care and/or general pediatric staff. Cases were identified from the hospital\u2019s computerized auditing system and from the PICU database of every admission to the unit. The PICU database was audited monthly. This retrospective study was carried out in the tertiary referral PICU. Every child in PICU with a proven influenza and parainfluenza virus infection from January 2003 through December 2009 was recruited. The respiratory viruses were identified using conventional diagnostic methods, including direct immunofluorescence testing (DIFT) on respiratory samples (e.g. nasopharyngeal aspirates\u2013NPAs; broncho-alveolar lavages\u2013BALs, tracheal aspirates\u2013TAs, and oral swabs), with confirmation and typing by type-specific DIFT and viral culture. In one case, a recent influenza A infection was confirmed by demonstrating a greater than four-fold rise in influenza A-specific antibodies using the complement fixation test. The results of all other (non-viral) bacterial cultures on respiratory specimens (including sputum) and blood cultures were evaluated. Numerical data were compared with student t test and categorical data with \u03c72 test. All comparisons were made two-tailed, and p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.",

Parainfluenza type 3 (n = 9) was the commonest subtype of parainfluenza infection. The median age of children admitted with influenza was higher than parainfluenza (4.5 vs >1.7 years, p = 0.044). There was no significant gender predilection in the two categories. Admissions associated with proven influenza and parainfluenza infections accounted for 2% of PICU annual admissions. There was only one death associated with influenza A in 2003. The duration of ICU stay was generally brief (median 3 days). Influenza affected older children than parainfluenza but there was no difference between the two groups of viruses in terms of morbidity. These respiratory viruses caused both upper (croup) and lower respiratory tract diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Extrapulmonary presentations such as seizures and encephalitis were less prevalent. 51% of these patients required ventilatory support, 45% received systemic corticosteroids for airway obstruction such as croup, and 91% received initial broad spectrum antibiotic coverage pending cultures. Bacterial co-infections were identified in 25% of these patients. The incidence of influenza PICU admissions had not increased significantly in 2009 (H1N1 pandemic) when compared with 2003 (SARS epidemic) (Table 2, Fig. 1; p = 0.3). Using the catchment population of over 1.1 million (approximately 25% were children <12 years of age), the annual incidence of severe PICU cases of influenza and parainfluenza were 0.94 and 0.88 per 100,000 children per annum, respectively.\n\n\n\n",

In recent years, there have been global concerns that the next influenza pandemic might result in increased mortality and morbidity. Flu infections can readily spread among children in daycare centers, schools and within families, resulting in school absence and parental loss of workdays to care for their sick children at home. Severe forms of respiratory viral infections are rare in children but may lead to life-threatening conditions, necessitating PICU admission and resulting in death [4, 17]. Despite massive global and media concerns in their locality, the authors have not witnessed a significant increase in mortality or severe PICU morbidity in recent years. Even with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, only two children with the H1N1 were admitted and there was no mortality. Similar phenomenon was observed in other PICUs in Hong Kong. There was no redirection of known H1N1 cases to other units and underestimation of the incidence was unlikely.",

As previously described, these respiratory viruses caused both upper (croup) and lower respiratory tract diseases (bronchiolitis, pneumonia). Extrapulmonary presentations were less prevalent. Empirical course of antibiotics was often used in the initial management in order to avoid missing any treatable bacterial co-infections [17]. Corticosteroids were often used empirically for airway obstruction such as croup. A low threshold for negative-pressure reverse isolation should be considered whenever possible so that other critically ill patients would not be put at risk. These principals are well illustrated in the two H1N1 cases in 2009. The first case demonstrated that institutionalized children with chronic illnesses are at high risk whereas the second case demonstrated previously well children are not spared. The clinical course was complicated by heavy growth of burkholderia cepacia in the tracheal aspirate. The second case was initially treated as presumed meningococcemia but was promptly confirmed to be a case of H1N1. The antibiotic was rightly continued as subsequent blood culture confirmed septicemia with S. pyogenes co-infection. As it is often difficult to delineate viral from bacterial infection in the acute setting, broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in nearly 90% of the study patients to cover for pneumonia and sepsis. The present findings were in agreement with those reported by other investigators [21, 22].",

In contrast to the influenza viruses, the parainfluenza viruses affect younger children. Worse still, there is no vaccine available and the antiviral agents for influenza are generally not efficacious for the parainfluenza viruses. Respiratory synctival virus (RSV) infection is also an important cause of PICU admissions that we previously described [17]. Clinical presentation and management in the PICU is similar except that the virus affects infants and younger children.",

In essence, all these viral infections are characterized by a contact history + fever + respiratory symptoms. The clinical definitions are very similar to that for SARS [20]. These definitions serve no good purposes and possibly confuse the public. They should not be confused with the influenza and the parainfluenza infections.",
