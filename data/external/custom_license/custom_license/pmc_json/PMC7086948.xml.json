It can infect dogs of any age, resulting in enteritis symptoms that include hemorrhagic diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and depression [2, 8, 10]. CCoV, a member of the family Coronaviridae, often causes mild diarrhea and is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality in canids; however, in puppies, the disease is more serious, with high morbidity and high mortality. If CCV and CPV-2 coinfection occurs, it often leads to lethal diarrhea [14, 15]. CAV is a member of the genus Mastadenovirus, family Adenoviridae. Although CAV is not primarily responsible for enteritis, it can also cause diarrheal clinical symptoms [5, 7]. These three viral infections are often mixed in the clinic, and their clinical symptoms of diarrhea are similar; therefore, it is often difficult to distinguish between them during clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations [9, 11].",

Due to its specificity and sensitivity, this method is gradually becoming the gold standard for pathogen identification. The multiplex PCR (mPCR) method is based on a single PCR that can simultaneously detect a variety of pathogens and simplify the operation steps, thereby saving time and expense [3]. Recently, mPCR has been widely used in the field of pathogen detection because it has advantages of speed, specificity and efficiency [1, 4, 16]. In this study, an mPCR method was established and applied for the detection of CPV-2, CAV and CCoV. The mPCR method was validated as an easy and effective method for the detection of these three viruses in rectal swab samples.",

All swab samples were used for the primary application of the mPCR method. Each swab sample was also evaluated using the routine PCR methods for the three viruses. The viral swab storage solutions were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 30 min, and the nucleic acids in the supernatant were extracted for detection via mPCR and routine PCR in triplicate. To confirm the results, all specific fragments amplified by mPCR were sequenced by the Sangon Biotech Company (Beijing, China).",

The clinical symptoms of these three viruses are similar, and cases of illness are often caused by a mixed infection. Several detection methods for these three viruses exist [6, 12, 13], but no single method can detect the presence of all three viruses together. As a result, the CCoV, CPV-2 and CAV must be detected individually, which is not only cumbersome but also a waste of time and reagents. In this study, an mPCR method for CPV-2, CCoV and CAV was established and applied. This method can detect all three viruses together, therefore simplifying the operation steps, shortening the detection time, and lowering the cost.",

In this method, the primer combination produced amplicons of 690 bp, 433 bp and 252 bp, which were easy to distinguish from one another. In addition, the three pairs of primers had similar annealing temperatures, which needed to be sufficiently high to avoid nonspecific bands, and 63\u00b0C was found to be sufficient. The specificity of the primers was verified using NCBI Primer-BLAST and, the DNASTAR software was used to check whether dimers or hairpin structures could form between the three primer pairs.",

Therefore, although this method has the advantages of simple operation, time savings, and low cost, there are inherent weaknesses of sensitivity due to the amount of competitive inhibition between the amplicons, which renders the sensitivity of the mPCR lower than that of single PCR [1, 4, 16]. Therefore, our expectation of the mPCR effect was that when the viral titer of each virus in the sample exceeded the sensitivity of the mPCR method, all viruses would be detected. A total of 63 rectal swabs from dogs with diarrheal symptoms were evaluated using mPCR and routine PCR; the results obtained by sequencing are shown in Table 2. The ratio of positive samples to total samples for CPV-2, CCoV and CAV was 55.6% (35/63) by mPCR and 55.6% (35/63) by routine PCR. Thirty-five positive samples were detected by both methods, for a coincidence ratio of 100%, indicating that the specificity and sensitivity of the method was sufficient for testing clinical specimens.",
