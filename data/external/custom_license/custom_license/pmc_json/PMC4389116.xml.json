            "text": "Neuraminidase has become the main target for drug design against influenza virus due to its highly conserved catalytic site and its essential role in influenza virus replication[1]-[5]. Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug against neuraminidase that is useful for preventing viral replication in the last stage of the viral live cycle[6]. It directly interacts with the catalytic residues of the neuraminidase catalytic site, while the framework residues stabilize the enzyme structure[7]. Resistance to oseltamivir has already become a widespread phenomenon, and prediction of the neuraminidase structure shows that the resistance could be several times higher than resistance to zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor[8],[9]. Mutations at the conserved residues of neuraminidase appear to associate with oseltamivir resistance in a subtype specific manner[6]. Arg292Lys, Asn294Ser, and His274Tyr are three known types of mutations that manifest oseltamivir resistance in H1N1 influenza virus[1],[9]-[11]. The frequency of His274Tyr mutant viruses is 64%, although it varies among different countries[9],[12] . A high prevalence of the mutant virus is seen in South Africa, New Caledonia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Australia[13], modest in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, but insignificant in Macau and Taiwan[12].",

Modifcation of oseltamivir to cope with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 has been attempted[1],[11], which is based on the properties of amino acid residues in the catalytic site of neuraminidase[19]. Drug-target interactions are being investigated using structural bioinformatics tools[20],[21]. In this study, we focused on the modification of the oseltamivir functional groups and molecular docking was performed to determine the best candidate ligand based on the lowest binding energy and interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation is a useful theoretical tool for analyzing the protein-ligand interactions with atomic resolutions based on classical mechanics[22]-[25]. We also carried out molecular dynamics simulation to evaluate the interaction of candidate ligands and the enzyme in the hydrated state at two different temperatures.",

In the tolerance limit area of residues plot, glysine was not allowed because it did not have a side chain, making \u03c6 (phi) and \u03c8 (psi) angles not limited. The number of residue plot besides glysine showed the quality of the protein structure. The results of the Ramachandran plot showed that only Lys331 was in the outlier. About 95.8% of the residues were in the core region of the Ramachandran map, so that the homology model was used for the docking process.

These pKi values of AD3BF2D, CA1G3B, and F1G4B ligands indicated that these ligands were effective and had better affinity to strongly interact with neuraminidase than oseltamivir. The molecular weights of these ligands were under 500 g/mol. AD3BF2D, CA1G3B and F1G4B ligands had a number of bindings with the catalytic site (10, 10 and 5 bindings, respectively) (Table 1).

The stability of hydrogen bonds also occured between Glu278 and NH3 functional group of AD3BF2D during simulations at 312 K. The stability of hydrogen bonds was also increased at simulations at 312 K between Arg293 and alcohol of the apioside group as the functional group of AD3BF2D ligand; and this interaction with Arg293 as catalytic residue of neuraminidase resulted in two hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5). If compared with the interaction that has 10 hydrogen bonds after docking, in the binding catalytic site, interaction after simulations could not form hydrogen bonds due to the mobility of amino acid residues in the catalytic site. It had different motions in solvent or hydrated conditions. These motions proved that there were dynamic enzymes due to the effect of solvent molecules. The presence of the different functional groups in each ligand had various bond effects that resulted in the different conformations. The stable interaction of AD3BF2D ligand to form hydrogen bonds during simulations at two different temperatures provided solid evidence that this ligand had affinity with neuraminidase. More complete ligand interactions data are in the supplementary material (http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~arli/supplementary_material.pdf). As shown in Fig. 6, there were changes in conformation of the enzyme-AD3BF2D ligand complex, which occured during simulation, and showed the dynamic behaviour of the enzyme in the presence of solvent and ligand. AD3BF2D ligand remained in the binding pocket after docking, initialization stage and at the end of simulations at 300 K and 312 K. The binding pocket of this complex changed from the \u2018closed\u2019 form into the \u2018open\u2019 state at the end of simulation. Based on the simulation results, the changes in conformation of enzyme-AD3BF2D ligand complex during simulations caused apioside and ammonium functional groups to form more stable interactions with Glu278 and Arg293 compared with others. Those functional groups, namely pentyloxy, aldehyde, and carboxylate did not form hydrogen bonds with binding pocket. More conformation figures of other ligands are listed in the Supplementary Material). Fig. 7A-F shows that the ligand-receptor interaction indeed reached its stability after 2,000\u20133,000 ps. This would suggest that the ligands, as drug candidates, are within the stable condition in the human body.",
