            "text": "Bioaerosols are the ubiquitously distributed suspended airborne particles of biological origin (bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, pollen, etc.) (Lee 2011). A wide range of factors affect their distribution, including meteorological conditions (Erkara et al. 2008; Jones and Harrison 2004), type of surrounding vegetation (Pepeljnjak and \u0160egvi\u0107 2003), bioaerosol size (Fang et al. 2008), nutrient availability (Chi and Li 2007), microbe-particle association (Despr\u00e9s et al. 2012), bioaerosol age (Li et al. 2015), human activities (Abdel Hameed et al. 2009), etc. The adverse effects of bioaerosols have been observed in humans as well as in animals (Millner 2009). Exposure to bioaerosols containing pathogenic species of microorganisms such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Curvularia, Alternaria, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus have been associated with a range of human diseases (Patil and Kakde 2017; Abdel Hameed et al. 2009; Hurtado et al. 2014). Some of the respiratory health problems caused by bioaerosol exposure are asthma (Dales et al. 2004), bronchial hyperactivity (Raisi et al. 2013) allergic rhinitis (Fung and Hughson 2010), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Matheson et al. 2005) etc.",

Even, simple human activities such as coughing, sneezing, talking, and mere breathing can induce microbial discharge from the respiratory tract (Han et al. 2013; Prussin and Marr 2015) into the ambient air. Therefore, the exposure risk of pathogenic bioaerosols is excessively high, especially in the overcrowded public spaces, such as religious places (Alananbeh et al. 2015), subway stations (Fan et al. 2017), train stations (Dong and Yao 2010), market areas, bus stations, etc. These places are also among the possible exposure hotspots for instigating bioterrorism attacks (Das and Kataria 2011).",

With a more rural population shifting towards urban areas, the atmospheric load of pollutants including microbial contaminants is also expected to increase significantly. In a report released by the World Health Organization (WHO 2016), Dehradun, an urbanized area in northern part of India, was listed as the 31st most polluted city in the world in terms of PM pollution (https://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/cities/en/). A recent study at Dehradun delineated the sources and excess cancer risk of PM10 inhalation (Prabhu and Shridhar 2019). In the study, besides vehicular emissions and biomass burning, road dust resuspension was identified as the major contributor to PM pollution in the city. Another study on the size segregated PM exposure in street vendors revealed a high respirable deposition dose of PM along with increased cases of respiratory-related disorders among those working at commercial area than at residential area (Prabhu et al. 2019). However, the authors have highlighted the need to study bioaerosol distribution to understand the impact of airborne pollutants on human health. It is also important to note that bioaerosols can occur as agglomerates attached to suspended PM (such as soil, dust, skin flakes, sand, etc.) (Xie et al. 2018), which enhances their viability and infectivity (Iwasaka et al. 2009). This highlight the hidden risks associated with the city\u2019s exposure to pathogenic bioaerosols. Owing to these facts, it is imperative to investigate the bioaerosol load at the locations where traffic flow and chances of infection to humans are high.",

Therefore, in this study, we focused on monitoring the distribution characteristics of airborne cultivable bioaerosols at a high traffic density site in Dehradun, India. The objectives of the study were to (i) investigate the temporal variation of cultivable airborne fungal and bacterial aerosols, (ii) understand the bioaerosol size distribution and their percentage contribution to PM, and (iii) characterize the microbial diversity at the study site.",

Aerosol sampling was conducted at a high traffic density junction of Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) at Dehradun city. ISBT was chosen as the sampling site because it is the only major bus terminal (hence, one of the most crowded public places) in Dehradun where thousands of commuters arrive every day. A pivotal three-way intersection, conjoining three National Highways witnesses frequent traffic jams in the area. The area adjoining the junction is surrounded by a cluster of roadside eateries, hotels, parking area, and a shopping mall (~ 100 m from the sampling location). Besides, the local taxis, autos, private busses, and other means of transport are also parked at this junction.",

            "text": "The airborne cultivable microbial samples were collected during the sampling campaign using six-stage viable Andersen Cascade Impactors (Tisch Environmental, Cleves, OH). The sampler collects bioaerosols in the following size ranges: 0.65\u20131.1 \u03bcm, 1.1\u20132.1 \u03bcm, 2.1\u20133.3 \u03bcm, 3.3\u20134.7 \u03bcm, 4.7\u20137.0 \u03bcm, and > 7.0 \u03bcm. These size fractions simulate the deposition pattern in different regions of the human respiratory system (Xu and Yao 2013). The flow rate of 28.3 L/min was maintained using a calibrated dry gas meter, before each sampling event. The samplers were disinfected with 70% ethanol before each sampling event to prevent any cross-contamination (Dybwad et al. 2014). Sampling was conducted three times a day for three consecutive days, every month, for a period of 2 years (from September 2016 to August 2018). The sampling protocol was adopted from Fang et al. (2005, 2008). The time duration of sampling was 15 min which was selected based on the following studies. According to the guidelines for bioaerosol monitoring studies given by Tortora et al. (1989) and Jensen and Schafer (1998), time duration within which a total of 30 to 100 microbial colonies can be collected in a single petriplate should be selected as the time period for conducting bioaerosol sampling. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted prior to the sampling campaign in the study site to optimize the sampling duration. Based on the pilot study, time duration of 15 min was considered as the optimum time period for collecting the bioaerosol colonies. The details and the results of the pilot study are present in Appendix 1. The timings of the sampling were morning (between 07:00 HH: MM, local time, LT and 10:00 HH: MM, LT), afternoon (between 12:00 and 15:00 HH: MM, LT) and evening (between 16:00 and 19:00 HH: MM, LT). Three times sampling each day was conducted to cover the active exposure time of the people which represents their daily working hours (i.e., between 07:00 HH: MM, LT and 19:00 HH: MM, LT). Tryptic Soy Agar supplemented with chloramphenicol (to inhibit fungal growth) was used to collect bacterial aerosols while Sabouraud dextrose agar supplemented with cycloheximide (to inhibit bacterial growth) was used to collect fungal aerosols (Faridi et al. 2015). Overall, 216 bacterial and fungal samples were collected during the study period. Further details on the sampling methodology are provided in Appendix 2.",

The values obtained for each parameter are shown after considering the number of significant figures associated with the uncertainty of measurement (explained in Appendix 8). The temporal variations in airborne microorganisms due to differences in meteorological conditions have been widely studied (Oliveira et al. 2009; Raisi et al. 2013). The correlation coefficients between different variables (bioaerosol concentration, size segregated PM concentrations, and meteorological parameters) are shown in Table 3. The relationship between bioaerosol concentrations and meteorological parameters revealed a significant positive correlation with temperature (r = 0.70 for bacteria and r = 0.61 for fungi) (p < 0.05). This may be attributed to the stimulating effect of temperature on microbial growth and emission from the soil, as also reported by Kowalski and Pastuszka (2018). Therefore, the minimum concentration levels during winter season were due to low temperature (17.0 \u00b1 2.7 \u00b0C), while the elevated concentrations during other seasons can be attributed to the attainment of optimal temperature for microbial growth (28.8 \u00b1 6.7 \u00b0C). All the pathogens associated with mesophyllic microorganisms can grow in the optimal temperature range of 20\u201340 \u00b0C (Madhwal et al. 2019). Therefore, chances of infection caused by exposure to pathogenic bioaerosols are low in winter compared to other seasons.",

Since June is the onset month of southwest monsoonal rain, this period experienced an increase in bacterial and fungal concentration compared to that of other months. This observation can be explained in different ways: (a) Bioaerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (Xie et al. 2018; Fr\u00f6hlich-Nowoisky et al. 2016), and therefore, may precipitate from higher altitudes during rain events (Heo et al. 2014) leading to increased concentration near the ground surface; (b) raindrop splash may induce microbial dislodging and aerosolization from the ground surface (Li et al. 2017; Lee 2011); (c) increase in humid conditions favors the bacterial growth, which is also evident from the significant positive correlation observed between bacterial bioaerosols and relative humidity (r = 0.64, p < 0.05). In the subsequent months of July and August, the fungal concentration decreased substantially, while the bacterial concentration showed an increasing trend. The observed results can be explained as follows: Fan et al. (2017) reported soil as a major source of fungal introduction in ambient air. However, as the soil moisture is high during the late monsoonal months, the fungal resuspension from ground decreased due to rainfall facilitated wet scavenging. This phenomenon is also mentioned in Rathnayake et al. (2017). On the other hand, the impact of wet sedimentation in bacteria was lower than fungi because of their comparatively smaller aerodynamic size. Instead, the increase in bacterial concentration observed during late monsoonal months implies that the additional bacterial contribution from different sources is the more important factor influencing their distribution than the wet scavenging.",

While wet deposition prevented ground-based aerosolization from traffic flow or human movement, elevated levels of bacterial aerosols in ambient air were possibly due to the release from the skin or respiratory expiration process of passersby. Fan et al. (2017) also reported that humans act as the direct source of bacterial emissions (from skin, body fluids and breathing) in crowded public spaces. A strong positive correlation between bacterial concentration and vehicle count (representing higher human movement) during monsoon season (r = 0.93, p < 0.05) supports our results. During post monsoonal months (September to November), the redemption of dry conditions augmented the vehicular movement induced soil resuspension, which could be attributed to the corresponding increase in bioaerosol concentration. Again, this explanation is supported by the statistically significant correlation observed between bioaerosol concentrations and vehicle count during the study period (r = 0.81 and 0.73 for bacteria and fungi, respectively) (p < 0.05).",

Here, dN = particle number concentration (particles/m3). Total fungal aerosols showed a 3.25% contribution in the total PM count while it was 5.65% for bacterial aerosols. The ratio at an aerodynamic size below 0.9 \u03bcm approaches zero (0.0013 for fungi and 0.0026 for bacteria) which suggests that the bioaerosol loading of PM in submicron size fraction is lower compared to larger size fractions. The elevated microbial contribution in larger sized particles can be associated with the observations made by Lighthart (1997) and Raisi et al. (2013) who reported that the particles larger than the size of the single microbial cell can hold a greater share of microbial aerosol. Thus, while particle bound bioaerosols are majorly associated with larger particles, their ability to remain suspended as freely floating cells increases with the decrease in the aerodynamic diameter. Our study also revealed that the bacterial concentration in submicron size fraction was greater than fungal concentration. Therefore, a significant portion of airborne bacteria in this size range may be representing the freely distributed forms. Taking together, it can be assumed that besides the traffic and human movement induced soil and dust resuspension, the aerosolization of bacteria, chiefly in submicron size range may be occurring from other sources such as human respiratory system, microflora present in the human body, etc. Johnson et al. (2011) ascertained that the modality of human expired aerosols can be divided into a bronchiolar/laryngeal/oral (B.L.O.) tri-modal distribution during the speech, coughing and tidal breathing process. However, understanding the mechanism of microbial aerosolization, adhesion to atmospheric particulates, and distribution as freely moving or particle-bound aerosols is beyond the scope of this paper. The longevity, viability, and infectivity of microorganisms in the atmosphere are significantly affected by their association with PM. Understanding this association is important especially in the heavily crowded areas such as bus stations, railway platforms, religious places, etc. where people gather in close proximity to each other and may initiate the anthroponotic (person to person transmission) transfer of microbial infections. Johnson et al. (2011) showed that the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can be associated with proximity to infected individuals at a distance of 1 m. Therefore, more research is needed to calculate the relative contribution of both the freely moving or attached forms in total bioaerosol concentration at the crowded public places.",

These results suggest that the commuters play a substantial role as the source of fungal aerosols in the ambient air of crowded public places. The pathogenic impact of these bioaerosols on the respiratory system has been reported in previous studies (Hern\u00e1ndez-Castillo et al. 2014; Patil and Kakde 2017; Santos et al. 2006).

The gram-positive species are predominantly found in soil and in skin, hair, mucosa, arms, mouth, etc. of humans (Faridi et al. 2015; Mentese et al. 2012). Therefore, roadside soil and dust resuspension caused by traffic flow and human-associated activities can be attributed to the relative abundance of gram-positive bacteria at the sampling location. Also, high resistance of gram-positive bacteria towards adverse environmental conditions such as desiccation and solar radiation can lead to its predominance. The prolong viability of gram-positive bacilli may be due to their ability to form desiccation tolerant spores (Shaffer and Lighthart 1997), while gram positive cocci survive by means of pigment formation (Hurtado et al. 2014).",

The upper respiratory tract and oral cavity in humans is an important source of various pathogenic microbial strains (Hurtado et al. 2014). Therefore, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, he/she may release pathogenic bioaerosols into the surrounding air and may also infect those in close proximity. In a study conducted by Tiwari et al. (2010), statistically significant clusters of tuberculosis were reported at many places in Dehradun city. This study and our findings suggest that the high traffic density zone at ISBT can be categorized under increased risk of exposure to pathogenic bioaerosols. With the current pace of urbanization, the continuous increment in traffic flow and population density is expected to increase the frequency of traffic jams and road congestion. The corresponding increase in the waiting time of passengers is indicative of a longer exposure period. This implicates that the study site is under high threat of turning into a prospective source of epidemic disease outbreaks. This also shows the significance of bioaerosol monitoring in similarly crowded traffic intersections in other cities around the world.",

The major findings of this study are highlighted below:The bacteria and fungi concentrations were highest during the monsoon and postmonsoon months, respectively. Major factors influencing the distribution were observed to be ground-based microbial aerosolization caused by raindrop splash, microbial discharge from humans (respiratory system and human body surface), elevated levels of relative humidity, and soil resuspension caused by vehicular and human movement.Although both fungi and bacteria contributed majorly to coarse PM, bacterial aerosols also showed increased concentration in submicron size fractions, indicating a potential additional contribution from the human body (viz.) through breathing, coughing or talking). This implicates that there are increased chances of bacteria-induced anthroponosis owing to the high proximity between visitors at the sampled location.The dominantly observed bioaerosols including Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus are the potential pathogens for respiratory ailments such as aspergillosis, asthma, rhinosinusitis, and various other pulmonary infections.Since high vehicle count and human activities were identified as the factors that masked the effects of microclimatic conditions, the results from this study site can be generalized for other similar crowded traffic areas. Moreover, observations showed that the traffic junctions are one of the key initiation points for the transmission of various communicable diseases and therefore can be studied to trace the source of microbial infections during the epidemic disease outbreaks.",
