However, after years of hard work, the important role of intensivists, as a coordinator during patient evaluation and treatment, has gradually been recognized and respected by other specialties. Junior physicians interested in critical care training can choose to be intensivists after they finish 3 or 4 years of fellowship training in surgery or internal medicine. However, the traditional specialties often still assume responsibility for or 'ownership' of patients, as well as have a desire to treat critically ill patients, as reflected by the fact that the proposal for setting up a critical care society under the Chinese Medical Association (CMA) was rejected in 1996.",

Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, of Streptococcus suis in 2005, and of avian influenza, as well as the Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008, caused extreme anxiety in the public due to the vulnerability of the general population, the high communicability of the diseases, and the high case fatality rate. Therefore, intensivists were often convened by the government to be involved in crisis management very early [6]. Their ability to coordinate, cooperate, and communicate with regard to both patient management and policy-making was well demonstrated during daily work, and recognised by the general public and healthcare authorities. As a result, critical care medicine was officially recognized as a specialty of clinical medicine in 2009 [7].",

In 2008, the Ministry of Health reported that there were a total of 2,882,862 beds in 19,712 hospitals in China [3]. Therefore, we estimate that there were 51,891 (37,477 to 60,540) ICU beds in China in 2008, corresponding to 3.91 (2.82 to 4.56) ICU beds per 100,000 population, with 217 hospital beds per 100,000 population.

In 2007, the CSCCM endorsed the Basic Assessment and Support Intensive Care course, and promoted the course in mainland China. Nine provider courses have been organized until November 2009, with more than 220 participants.
