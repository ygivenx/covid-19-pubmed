            "text": "RNA\u2013DNA interactions possess prominent functionalities in diverse biological processes through genetic and epigenetic regulations. NcRNAs are key regulators of chromatin states and gene expression for important biological processes such as dosage compensation [8], imprinting [9], development process [10], lineage differentiation, and disease progression including cancinogenesis [11], where DNA\u2013RNA hybrid formation plays an important role. RNAs provide the templates to orchestrate genome rearrangement in some species such as Oxytricha and act as the templates to facilitate DNA translocation in the \u2018trans-splicing mediation\u2019 model of non-canonical gene fusions resulted from intergenic splicing [12]. Further, the activity of the telomerase holoenzyme is determined by the binding affinity between the telomerase RNA template region and the DNA primer [13]; the CRISPR system against foreign nucleic acid invasion in bacteria and archaea involves DNA/RNA hybrids; steady-state circRNAs have been mapped to thousands of genomic loci in mammals and contribute to gene regulation [6]; and transcriptional pausing can be modeled using sequence-dependent free energy of nucleic acid interactions including DNA\u2013RNA base pairing. While some lncRNAs work in cis on neighboring genes, others function in trans to regulate distantly located genes. For example, while both playing fundamental roles in X chromosome inactivation and dose compensation, human lncRNA Xist functions in cis [8] and Drosophila ncRNAs roX1 and roX2 bind numerous regions in trans on the X chromosome of male cells.",

            "text": "Most evidence on the interactions between RNA and DNA was observed at the chromatin level. We extract RNA\u2013DNA interaction modes from this context and summarize them into 4 types. We define \u2018type 1\u2019 as \u2018RNA interaction with single DNA strand forming R loop\u2019, \u2018type 2\u2019 as \u2018RNA interaction with double DNA strand forming triple helix\u2019, \u2018type 3\u2019 as \u2018RNA interaction with single DNA strand without R loop\u2019, and \u2018type 4\u2019 as \u2018RNA interaction with double DNA strand forming tertiary structure\u2019. Type 1 is the mode used for mRNA elongation in the transcription machinery, where the R loop comprises the nascent RNA hybridized with the DNA template strand and the single-stranded non-template DNA [14]. Recent advances have confirmed the role of type 1 mode RNA\u2013DNA interaction in regulating ncRNA expression. For instance, R loops are formed over the promoter region of the lncRNA COOLAIR and stabilized by AtNDX (a ssDNA-binding homeodomain protein) to suppress its transcription [15]. The sgRNAs in the CRISPR system function via the type 1 mode for genome-editing, representing an exogenous example (Fig. 2a). The type 2 mode is adopted by many lncRNAs to regulate gene expression in cis or in trans [16]. For instance, promoter-associated RNAs (pRNAs) regulate rRNA gene expression by forming stable RNA\u2013DNA triple helix with the promoter sequence, and the formed triplex is specifically recognized by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3b that results in de novo CpG methylation of rRNA genes (Fig. 2b). It is also reported that specific endogenous miRNAs take the type 2 mode to fight against viral invasion in eukaryotic cells by entangling with double strand DNA viruses such as HIV-1 and forming stable triplexes with viral DNA motifs [17]. The RNA template of telomerase takes the type 3 mode to interact with single DNA strand for chromosome elongation (Fig. 2c). The type 4 mode is a potential model recently proposed where RNA serves as a structural component to maintain the 3D genome conformation (Fig. 2d).",

Kingston et al. established a hybridization-based technique that specifically enriches endogenous RNAs along with their targets from reversibly cross-linked chromatin extracts, namely CHART (capture hybridization analysis of RNA targets), to map the genomic binding sites for endogenous RNAs [18] (Table 2). Chang et al. developed a method termed ChIRP (chromatin isolation by RNA purification) to allow unbiased high-throughput discovery of RNA-bound DNA and proteins in vivo, where cultured cells are cross-linked and RNAs of interest are hybridized to target RNAs through biotinylated complementary oligonucleotides followed by magnetic bead isolation (Table 2). While most efforts have been devoted to approaches utilizing cell extracts, Zhong et al. developed MARGI (mapping RNA-genome interactions) to massively reveal native RNA-chromatin interactions from unperturbed cells, which is achieved through RNA\u2013DNA proximity ligation followed by paired-end sequencing of these chimeric sequences (Table 2).",

The milestone in this regard is perhaps the discovery of Alanine transfer RNA and decoding of the triplet system by Robert Holley for which he was awarded with the Nobel Prize. The interactions between tRNA and mRNA transfer genetic information to protein functionalities and fill up the gap in genetic information flow. Another fundamental landmark awarded with Nobel Prize is the regulatory roles of RNAs on gene expression derived from siRNA-mRNA interactions, which has led to technical advances in gene expression modulation, namely RNA interference. RNA-RNA interactions represent a general strategy used by many ncRNAs to achieve complicated and diverse biological functionalities. For example, genome-wide RNA interactome analysis revealed that TINCR (terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA) interacts with a range of differentiation mRNAs through a 25-nucleotide \u2018TINCR box\u2019 motif, and is required for their high mRNA abundance.",

The formation of structured RNA such as duplexes represents a critical feature of RNA mediated biological processes. The lead RNA can take diverse roles when interacting with its RNA partner such as enzyme (e.g., ribozyme in mRNA degradation), sponge (e.g., circRNA in miRNA regulation), schaffold (e.g., lncRNA during nascent RNA production), and guider (e.g., snoRNA in rRNA maturation) (Fig. 3).

Many methods have been developed for global-scale mapping of RNA duplexes in vitro and in vivo in a systematic global scale that couple high-throughput sequencing and RNA footprinting strategies utilizing structure-sensitive chemicals (such as structure-seq [20]) or nucleases (such as FragSeq [21], which is short for fragmentation sequencing). Detection of long-range and other tertiary RNA interactions has been achieved by structure-based approaches including nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscropy [22]. RNA proximity ligation following immunoprecipitation of complexes of interest given a known interacting protein partner has been launched with success for mapping several types of RNA interactions such as AGO-CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) in identifying Argonaute-bound miRNA-mRNA interactions [23], hiCLIP (RNA hybrid and individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) in recognizing Staufen-bound structured RNAs [24], and CLASH (cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids) for characterizing snoRNP-bound snoRNA-rRNA interactions and miRNA interactions [25]. A RAP based method, namely RAP-RNA (RNA antisense purification-RNA), has been proposed to comprehensively characterize in vivo intermolecular RNA\u2013RNA interactions of a target RNA and distinguish direct and indirect interactions through differential usage of crosslinking reagents with different specificities for proteins and nucleic acids [26] (Table 2). More sophisticated approaches have been continuously developed for globally detecting RNA\u2013RNA interactions in vivo without prior knowledge of RNAs forming interactions and their interacting proteins. Wan et al. proposed the SPLASH (sequencing of psoralen crosslinked, ligated, and selected hybrids) approach to map pairwise RNA interactions in vivo in a genome-wide scale, where EZ-Link-Psoralen-PEG3-Biotin was used to enable biotinylation of RNA via UV-light-activated intercalation of the psoralen group with thymine- and other pyrimidine-containing bases to form covalent bonds and the interacting RNA pairs were identified by sequencing (Table 2). Blencowe et al. proposed LIGR-seq (ligation of interacting RNA followed by high-throughput sequencing) to enable the global-scale mapping of RNA-RNA duplexes cross-linked in vivo, where modified psoralen derivative 4\u2032-aminomethyltrioxalen (AMT) was used to generate AMT-cross-linked RNA duplex followed by high-throughput sequencing of RNA chimeras [27] (Table 2). Chang et al. developed the PARIS (psoralen analysis of RNA interactions and structures) method based on reversible AMT crosslinking to globally map RNA duplexes in living cells with near base-pair resolution and capture the complexity of RNA structures through direct identification of base-paired helices [28] (Table 2). Sheng et al. presented the MARIO (mapping RNA interactome in vivo) technique to massively reveal RNA\u2013RNA interactions from unperturbed cells by cross-linking RNAs with their bound proteins followed by ligating interacting RNAs to biotinylated RNA linker and subjecting RNA1-Linker-RNA2 to paired-end sequencing [29] (Table 2).",

RNPs are RNA\u2013protein complexes that play an integral part in numerous biological processes, e.g., ribosome in protein synthesis, telomerase in chromosome protection, ribonuclease P in small ncRNA transcription, hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) in gene transcription and post-transcriptional modification, and snRNP in pre-mRNA splicing.",

Garciablanco et al. developed the RIP (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation) assay to study RNA\u2013protein interactions in vivo (Table 2). This technique has been combined with high-throughput technologies and evolved as RIP-Chip (RIP microarray) and RIP-seq (RIP sequencing) [33] to facilitate studies on RNA\u2013protein interactions in the genome-wide scale (Table 2). Darnell et al. developed the CLIP (UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) approach to reveal the interactions between RNAs and their binding proteins through in vivo UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (Table 2); and later proposed the HITS-CLIP technique by combining CLIP with high-throughput sequencing to produce transcriptome-wide RNA binding maps with higher accuracy and resolution [34] (Table 2). Tuschl et al. developed a step-by-step protocol for the transcriptome-wide isolation of RNA segments bound by the protein of interest from the background un-crosslinked RNAs, namely PAR-CLIP (photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking an immunoprecipitation), via introducing photoreactive nucleosides that generate characteristic sequence alterations on crosslinking, converting isolated crosslinked RNA fragments into a cDNA library followed by deep-sequencing [35] (Table 2). Ule et al. developed individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP (iCLIP) to identify protein-RNA crosslink sites with nucleotide resolution, where the use of two cleavable adapter regions and barcode that enables PCR amplification of truncated cDNAs (the truncated sites represent the cross-linked nucleotide contributes) followed by circularization, linear cleavage and high-throughput sequencing contribute to the trick of this technology (Table 2). TRAP/RAT (tandem RNA-affinity purification/RNA affinity in tandem) does not depend on formaldehyde nor cross-linking, but is an RNA tag-based method for affinity purification of endogenously assembled RNP complexes followed by mass spectrometry protein identification (Table 2). RiboTrap is another approach of this kind that purifies targeted RNPs from cell lysates through immunoaffinity precipitation to describe in vivo endogenous assembly of ribonucleoproteins (Table 2). MS2-BioTRAP (MS2 in vivo biotin tagged RNA affinity purification) co-expresses HB-tagged bacteriophage protein MS2 and stem-loop tagged target RNAs in cells followed by HB-tag based affinity purification of authentic RNA\u2013protein complexes, and proteins associated with target RNAs are subsequently identified and quantified using SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry [36] (Table 2).",

CRAC (cross-linking and analysis of cDNAs) resolves the restrictions imposed by the use of highly-specific antibodies in CLIP for analyzing protein-RNA interactions in large RNPs containing many different proteins (Table 2). By adapting the RNA antisense purification (RAP) method to purify a specific lncRNA complexes and identifying the interacting proteins using quantitative mass spectrometry, RAP-MS (RNA antisense purification by mass spectrometry) enables characterization of interacting proteins of a given lncRNA [37] (Table 2). RaPID (RNA purification and identification) allows for the isolation of specific mRNAs of interest and subsequent analysis of the associated proteins using mass spectrometry [38] (Table 2). A couple of methods have been developed to determine RNA\u2013protein binding specificities. While RNA-Compete (competition between individual RNA sequences binding to proteins), SEQRS (in vitro selection, high-throughput sequencing of RNA and sequence specificity landscapes) [39], RBNS (RNA Bind-n-Seq) [40] and RNA-MITOMI (RNA-mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions) [41] capture RNA\u2013protein binding specificities in vitro, RNA-MaP (RNA on a massively parallel array) and HiTS-RAP (high-throughput sequencing-RNA affinity profiling) [42] achieve this in situ. RNA-Compete uses RNA\u2013protein binding followed by microarray analysis to enable high-throughput identification of RNA binding motifs (Table 2). SEQRS is featured by being capable of identifying RNAs interacting with the protein of interest with low binding affinities and multiple binding modes in a single experiment [39] (Table 2). RBNS novels in measuring the binding affinities both quantitatively and in a high-throughput manner (Table 2). RNA-MITOMI provides a microfluidic platform to allow the identification of new binding specificities through screening the interaction of a RNA mutant library with stem-loop-binding protein [41] (Table 2). RNA-MaP repurposes a high-throughput sequencing instrument to quantitatively measure the binding and dissociation of a fluorescently labeled protein to a library of RNA targets generated on a flow cell surface by in situ transcription [43] (Table 2). HiTS-RAP allows simultaneous transcription of hundreds of millions of DNA clusters that are each derived from amplifying a single molecule with primers covalently linked to the glass flowcell, and the binding of fluorescently labeled proteins to these transcribed RNA clusters is analyzed afterwards [42] (Table 2).",

For instance, RNase P enzymes consist of both RNA and protein subunits where the RNA fraction is indispensible for catalyzing the removal of the 5\u2032 leader sequences from tRNA precursors; RNase MRP (mitochondrial RNA processing) enzymes cleave the A4 site in the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) region of pre-rRNAs to generate mature 5.8S rRNA. Some RNAs serve as the guide to specify the sites of modification for the enzyme to execute the catalytic function. For instance, site-specific synthesis of the 2\u2032-O-methylated nucleotides and pseudouridines in rRNAs and snRNAs is guided by snoRNAs through base-pairing followed by snoRNP protein catalyzed 2\u2032-O-methyl transfer and uridine-to-pseudouridine isomerization reactions. Some RNAs direct the associated proteins to the targeted sites to trigger conformational change of the substrate for subsequent catalysis. For example, snRNAs constitute a large family with at least 10 members; they form ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs) with their associated proteins and bind specific sequences on the pre-mRNA, resulting in the exposure of nucleotides favorable for splicing.",

While miRNAs are endogenous interfering RNAs introducing Dicer to silence the target mRNAs, shRNAs and siRNAs are exogenous RNAs and have become standard approaches for gene modulation at the post-transcriptional level. Similarly, CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and trans-activating CRISPR RNAs (transRNAs) orchestrate in leading the Cas9 endonuclease to the target site to fight against foreign genetic elements invasion in the prokaryotic immune system. This has been modified into an effective genome editing tool where crRNA and transRNA are modified into a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) delivered together with the Cas9 nuclease for the modulation of any desired location in a cell\u2019s genome.",

            "text": "CircRNAs have diverse lengths and are more stable than linear RNAs. CircRNAs can function to modulate miRNA activities [51], regulate alternative splicing [52, 53], and sponge other factors such as RBPs or RNP complexes [51]. Being a miRNA activity regulator, circRNA could sponge miRNA complexes and potentially release them on cleavage. For instance, circRNA 0000515 sponges miRNA326 to promote cervical cancer progression via up-regulating ELK1 [54], circRNA TTN acts as a sponge of miRNA432 to facilitate the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts through the IGF2/PI3K/AKT pathway [55], circRNA NRIP1 functions as a miRNA149-5p sponger to promote gastric cancer progression via AKT1/mTOR signaling [56], and circRNA TRIM33-12 acts as the sponge of miRNA191 to suppress hepatocellular cancer progression [57]. The regulatory role of circRNA on alternative splicing is associated with circRNA biogenesis. As pre-mRNA splicing is dictated by competitions between alternative pairing of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites and backsplicing during circRNA generation affects the splicing pattern of the remaining pre-mRNA, circRNAs modulate alternative splicing as a process regardless of the functionalities of circRNAs produced [52]. CircRNAs can also sponge RBPs or RNP complexes to prevent them from acting, provide a protective reservoir of these factors, and deliver them to particular subcellular locations [58]. Lastly, the protein-coding function of circRNAs has been recently identified but still lack sufficient evidence, and novel approaches such as the \u2018intron-mediated enhancement system\u2019 have been proposed to investigate circRNA protein-coding functionalities through increasing circRNA formation [59].",

This is especially true in eukaryotes and concords with the hypothesis that RNAs devolved some of their functions to DNAs and proteins and pertained the mediating role. RNAs were selected as the primary regulator of many cell events due to their rapid metabolism that is required for dynamic regulation of cellular homostasis. Though RNAs preserve the information storage capacity in prokaryotes as evidenced by RNA viruses, they are simply genetic information storage unit and need to hijack host materials for propagation. This suggests the prominent roles of macromolecular interactions in driving RNA functionalities in any organisms. Importantly, many biological activities involve multi-player interactions, e.g., RNA and protein function together to maintain chromosome stability for telomerase to take on the action mode. Thus, we cannot dissect any function from its context and leave molecular interactions aside. RNAs interact with other molecules through base pairing, and this actualizes its multiple functionalities such as information transduction and executioner guidance in the case of short regulatory RNAs, and tertiary structure formation in the case of long regulatory RNAs and mRNAs.",

RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic materials that can be translated on cell infection through interacting with host cellular system. For instance, positive strand RNA viruses perform many functions during viral replication such as viral RNA recruitment for replication, membrane-bound replicase complex assembly, replicase activity regulation, and minus- and plus- strand RNA synthesis through interacting with various host RBPs, and these RBPs include eEF1A, hnRNP proteins and the Lsm 1-7 complex that are conserved across diverse positive strand RNA viruses [60]. Viroids are small nonencapsulated circular ssRNAs that are not protein-coding but replicate in plants as free RNA molecules through RNA structure-based interactions with host cellular factors for functionalities and reply on host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II for transcription. For instance, potato spindle tuber viroid modulates its replication through directly interacting with a negative splicing regulator RPL5 [61]. CrRNAs constitute prokaryotic immune system by assisting Cas proteins recognize and cut exogenous DNA. On phage infection, proteo-spacers are lysed by bacteria Cas protein complexes and integrated into the 5\u2032 end of the CRISPR sites in host genome which are then transcribed into crRNAs and function as the template against phage proto-spacers once infected again [62\u201364].",

Far less effort has been laid on communications between RNAs and carbohydrates except for the glycosylation potential of tRNAs [65], as well as interactions between RNAs and metabolites except for riboswitches. The story does not stop here and we cannot help ask whether other molecules, such as metallic ions, hormones and ATP interact with RNAs?

Do these interactions represent a distinct class of RNA function besides information flow, genetic and epigenetic regulation, as well as signal transduction as afore-discussed?",
