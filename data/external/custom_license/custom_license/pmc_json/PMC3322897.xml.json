            "text": "Before the outbreak of SARS, the list of federal quarantinable diseases in the United States had not been revised since 1983. It included cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Marburg, Ebola, and Congo-Crimean (4\u20136). Within days of the appearance of SARS, other countries, including Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Singapore instituted restrictive health measures, including large-scale quarantine, to prevent the further spread of the disease. In Ontario, Canada, where SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was transmitting in the population, the provincial government made SARS a reportable, virulent, communicable disease under Ontario\u2019s Health Protection and Promotion Act. This change enabled Ontario public health officers to issue orders to enjoin infected persons from engaging in activities that may transmit SARS. At the federal level, Health Canada also dispatched quarantine officers to international airports in Toronto and Vancouver, screened incoming air passengers from infected areas for SARS, and distributed health alerts at major airports in Canada.",

            "text": "In the United States, the federal executive branch moved rapidly to revise the list of quarantinable communicable diseases by adding SARS to the diseases specified in the April 4, 2003, executive order (9). This provided U.S. federal health officials with quarantine powers comparable to those in other countries affected by SARS. Similar to actions taken in other countries, CDC quarantine officers also began screening incoming passengers for symptoms of SARS, distributing health alerts and advisories regarding SARS, and coordinating with airport personnel in the evaluation of sick passengers. Meanwhile, the nature of the disease was rapidly evolving. For example, it was not known whether the name of the disease might change from SARS to something else as more was learned about the disease. To deal with this possibility, the executive order described SARS as follows: \u201ca disease associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness, is transmitted from person to person predominantly by the aerosolized or droplet route, and, if spread in the population, would have severe public health consequences\u201d (9). HHS also streamlined the process of adding new quarantinable diseases by eliminating the need to dual-publish the list of diseases in an executive order and in regulations (10). Future revisions to the list of quarantinable diseases require only an executive order, which will be posted on the Web at: http://www.cdc.gov and http://www.archives.gov/federal_register (10).",

            "text": "CDC has generally deferred to state and local health authorities in the primary use of their own separate \u201cpolice power\u201d quarantine authorities to restrict the movement of persons within their boundaries. During the SARS outbreak, for example, some states relied on their own legal authorities to control the movement of persons, so it was not necessary for CDC to invoke federal quarantine power to compel the isolation or quarantine of a person within a state. On the basis of a long and successful history of collaboration with the states during public health emergencies, CDC is likely to invoke federal quarantine power only rarely, such as at ports of entry or other time-sensitive situations. In these situations, and in others that are, for example, inherently and necessarily beyond the capacity of state and local jurisdictions to control, CDC has the legal tools it needs to quarantine and isolate persons for SARS and other specified communicable diseases.",

Historically, public health legal counsels have served as \u201ctechnicians\u201d in public health practice, asked by the public health agencies they serve to interpret arcane statutory language and render opinions. Legal preparedness, however, is increasingly being viewed as a critical component of state and local government public health preparedness activities. As demonstrated repeatedly, in the SARS outbreak (quarantine/isolation); in the introduction of monkeypox in the Western Hemisphere (restrictions upon the exotic animal pet trade); and during West Nile virus season (mosquito abatement/spraying programs), legal issues are nearly always intertwined with public health responses. During emergencies, communication among public health lawyers at all levels (federal, state, and local) is a crucial part of the \u201cnew normal\u201d in public health. Until recently, however, there was no ready means for public health lawyers to communicate rapidly among themselves and quickly access relevant legal information.",

            "text": "During the SARS outbreak, CDC established a series of telephone conferences, whereby federal, state, and local public health lawyers could discuss important legal issues of the day and trade ideas about pending legal problems. These teleconferences were particularly useful in exchanging information concerning the interplay of quarantine authority at the federal, state, and local levels and discussion of procedural requirements involved in executing isolation or quarantine orders. These legal teleconferences were reinstituted and held daily during the peak of the monkeypox outbreak. Additionally, during the monkeypox outbreak, CDC developed a Web-based clearinghouse where just-issued legal documents such as gubernatorial executive orders and state and local health department rules could be posted. CDC, through its Public Health Law Program, plans to expand the scope of this clearinghouse to reduce the time required to identify relevant legal documents and disseminate them to public health legal counsels on a \u201creal time\u201d basis. The clearinghouse is available at: http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/od/phlp/. The addition of a Web-based clearinghouse and a teleconference capacity increases CDC\u2019s effectiveness in responding to public health emergencies by more fully integrating lawyers into the public health response.",
