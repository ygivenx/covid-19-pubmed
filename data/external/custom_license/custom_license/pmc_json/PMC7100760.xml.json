During the last decade, many developing countries have adopted intensive poultry production in order to meet the demand for this form of animal protein [1].

Out of these, infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious viral disease of chicken [2] caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). It is listed as notifiable disease by the office of international des epizooties [3], because of its domestic and international importance.",

There are several limitations with these techniques such as VI is laborious and time consuming, antibody based techniques require specific monoclonal antibodies for each strain, and real-time PCR is expensive and requires expertise. RT-PCR is the most widely used molecular technique to detect the IB viral genome either in allantoic fluids from embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) inoculated with field samples or directly from the tissue samples. However, it requires an expensive thermal cycler to carry out the reaction. Several authors used different targets like the nucleoprotein gene (N-gene) [10\u201312], Spike protein 2 (S2) [13\u201315], Spike protein 1(S1) [16, 17], M [18] and 3\u2032-UTR [19] to diagnose IB by RT-PCR.",

Hence, S2 gene was targeted for IB viral genome detection in the field samples [13\u201315].",

At 60\u00ba C for 45 min, the product from LAMP was better than that in other temperatures and time (data not shown). Hence, 60 \u00b0C and 45 min were considered as the optimal temperature and time for IBV-S2 gene RT-LAMP respectively. Alternatively, visual inspection of RT-LAMP amplification products in the reaction tubes was carried out by using propidium iodide. A positive reaction tube containing IBV-specific amplicons exhibited a pink color, while the contents within the negative control tube showed the original orange red color and under the UV-transilluminator, the positive sample showed fluorescence and negative sample showed absence of fluorescence.",

The IB viral genome was detected by RT-LAMP and RT-PCR in 12 and six samples for S2 gene respectively (Table 2). Among different tissue samples tested, more positive results were seen for kidney samples when tested by RT-LAMP (n = 6) than by RT-PCR (n = 3) whereas the results were similar in both the tests for trachea and caecal tonsils. The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP was 100 % and the specificity was 92 % for S2 gene. The analysis of field samples by RT-LAMP indicated increased percent positivity (13.7 %) when compared with the RT-PCR (5.9 %). This increased percent positivity is due to the higher sensitivity of RT-LAMP (10 EID50) than that of RT-PCR (103 EID50) for the detection of IB viral genome and this is in accordance with the results of Xu et al. [22] who showed that the RT-LAMP was 157 % sensitive than the RT-PCR in detecting IBD viral genome in field samples. RT-LAMP positive samples were further confirmed by using ECE as well as by sequencing the RT-PCR products which used F3 and B3 primers of RT-LAMP. The sequencing result showed that these samples were of M41 genotype. Thus, as the results indicate that the detection limit of RT-LAMP for IB viral genome is higher than the RT-PCR and the reaction time is 45 min only, this technique is more rapid than the RT-PCR. Moreover, the addition of dyes such as propidium iodide to the end product alleviates the use of electrophoresis. Hence, RT-LAMP for IB viral genome detection can be used as a routine diagnostic tool in avian disease diagnostic laboratories in which sophisticated equipments such as thermal cycler and electrophoresis apparatus are not available. In addition, RT-LAMP for IB viral genome detection can be used as a field diagnostic test.",
