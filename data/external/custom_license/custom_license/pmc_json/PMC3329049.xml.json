The increased demand for civet cat, suspected as the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome, is one such example. The demand for tonic food has risen with improving economic conditions in post-1978 China and is a form of conspicuous consumption that expresses economic and social distinction and prestige. A Chinese medical paradigm based on \"humors\" inherent in the concept of tonic food, combined with the well-understood cultural symbolism of distinction and prestige associated with conspicuous consumption, has lent weight to the demand for rare and exotic animals perceived to be \"pure,\" \"safe,\" and \"virile.\" Since this rising demand is not likely to be suppressible, regulated production of these animals is needed to make them safe.",

The forces driving this effect can be divided into three overlapping categories: the dismantling of the organizational and spatial structures that helped keep order in China\u2019s cities during the Maoist era (from 1949 to 1978); a dramatic increase in the overall fluidity of urban societies in China (accompanied by the erosion of traditional moral and behavioral boundaries); and a new set of cultural values that has encouraged more urban Chinese to think of themselves as actors with individual agency. These overlapping forces, which are geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural, are interwoven with and thoroughly implicated in the emergence of new behavior and lifestyles that have put a growing number of Chinese at risk for infectious diseases.",
