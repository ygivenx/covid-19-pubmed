Its peptidase activity is completely abolished by either chelating the zinc ion or exchanging the conserved amino acid residues18.

When GPI-anchored proteins are deprived of their lipid moiety, they shift from the detergent-soluble phase to the water-soluble phase. This assay system was used for monitoring GPIase activity through purification. We examined this activity in various organs using both EGFP-GPI and the placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) as probes for GPI-anchored proteins and found a substantial activity in testicular germ cells (see Supplementary Fig. 1 online). We also examined the expression of Gpld1, the gene that encodes a GPI anchor\u2013cleaving enzyme in mammals22,23, in various tissues. Because testicular germ cells do not express Gpld1, this activity may be compensated by other factors (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). Therefore, we decided to identify the molecular entity of the enzyme responsible for GPIase activity in these cells. Using serial liquid chromatography that started from detergent-soluble fraction of mouse testicular germ cells, we purified a 100-kDa protein and subsequently identified it as ACE by proteomics analysis (Fig. 1a, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 online). To confirm that this GPIase activity involved ACE, we performed a similar assay using either a recombinant product of testicular isoform ACE (ACE-t; Supplementary Fig. 4 online) or a commercially available rabbit ACE (ACE-S) and purified PLAP as substrate (Supplementary Fig. 5 online). The products released by this activity had the same size as those of bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase (PI-PLC), a commonly used GPI anchor\u2013cleaving enzyme, implying that this activity cleaves GPI-anchored protein located in proximity to the cleavage site of PI-PLC (Fig. 1b). Similar activities were shown by both molecules in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1c, data not shown), confirming that ACE was responsible for GPIase activity and did not require other factors for the action.",

First, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which can remove various metal ions from proteins, was added at different doses to the PLAP conversion assay. Because EDTA has some inhibitory effects on PLAP enzyme action24, immunoblotting was performed using antibody specific for PLAP to check for PLAP release. GPIase activity was inhibited by 1 mM of EDTA but not by an amount (10% less) at which peptidase activity was considerably inhibited (Fig. 2a). We also assessed the effects of other metal chelating reagents, such as trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N, N, N\u2032, N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (CyDTA) and ethylene glycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N, N\u2032, N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The peptidase activity was vigorously inhibited by 1 mM of each of these reagents, but found no inhibition of GPIase activity. To confirm the difference in GPIase and peptidase activities, we replaced Glu414 with aspartate or replaced both His413 and His417 with lysine in ACE-t (Supplementary Fig. 4 online), which activates a water nucleophile as a general base or captures a zinc ion, thus becoming essential for peptidase activity18. These mutants showed only a trace peptidase activity but retained GPIase activity at a level comparable with that of wild-type ACE-t (Fig. 2b). The GPIase activity of H413K-H417K mutant, which cannot capture the zinc ion at the peptidase active site, was also inhibited by high-dose EDTA but not by CyDTA or EGTA (Fig. 2c), suggesting that EDTA-induced inhibition of GPIase activity is mediated in a non-metal-chelating manner25,26 and that the GPIase action of ACE does not require zinc ion. Considered together, these results suggest that the active site element for GPIase activity differ from that for peptidase activity.",

Most of the GPI-anchored proteins are localized and packed in the lipid raft28,29,30. Furthermore, increased accessibility of GPI-anchored proteins to shedding enzyme was observed upon disruption of lipid raft31. Because filipin has no pharmacological effects on ACE GPIase activity, as assessed by PLAP conversion assay (data not shown), exogenous ACE seems to be prevented from accessing the substrate molecules by this membrane microstructure. In contrast, both ACE and PI-PLC had no effect on the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, implying that the activity of ACE is unique for GPI-anchored protein shedding. Moreover, ACE displayed both time- and dose-dependent enzymatic characteristics (data not shown).",

Following sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, we performed autoradiography followed by immunoblotting to detect EGFP-GPI protein. The ACE-released EGFP-GPI was labeled with [32P]-phosphate or [3H]-ethanolamine, but not mGK-treated products, indicating the presence of a portion of GPI anchor structure in the ACE-released molecules (Fig. 4a). The radioactivity of released products was about one-third when it was labeled on the phosphate and one-half on the ethanolamine compared with those of PI-PLC-released molecules, suggesting that ACE cleaves GPI anchor between mannoses or at the linkage between phosphate and the third mannose.",

This conclusion was supported by the fact that its tandem mass spectra showed intense dehydrated ions of (M + H)+ at m/z 642 and less intense ions at m/z 498 that underwent neutral loss of mannose-H2O.

Furthermore, this activity of ACE might also be different from that of GPI-PLD, the only enzyme known so far to cleave GPI anchor in mammals22,23. It has been reported that GPI-PLD releases GPI-anchored protein only when it is expressed intracellularly in culture cells23. In contrast, ACE efficiently released GPI-anchored protein from the cell surface. Because GPI-PLD cleaves GPI anchor at the phosphorus-oxygen bond of the phosphatidylinositol backbone22, inositol acylation may also prevent completion of GPI-anchored protein release by GPI-PLD. Indeed, GPI-PLD could not release DAF from the intact erythrocyte37. In contrast, ACE cleaved GPI anchor distal to the inositol moiety, with no influence on inositol acylation.",

We believe that the sperm capacitation process includes a similar reaction caused by filipin treatment of culture cells. In this regard, GPI-anchored proteins were not released in sperms of Ace knockout mice (Fig. 5a).

In this regard, male mice lacking angiotensinogen and kallikrein were fertile, excluding the involvement of ACE substrates such as angiotensin I and bradykinin in fertilization39,40. Based on these findings, our results suggest two scenarios: (i) functional activation of some GPI-anchored proteins on the sperm surface upon their release; (ii) exposure of a zona pellucida\u2013binding factor after the shedding of some GPI-anchored proteins. By using a cell-surface biotinylation technique, we found that ACE released several proteins from the membrane fraction of germ cells (G.K., unpublished data). These proteins might also contain GPI-anchored proteins that do not directly contribute to the sperm-egg binding, although how such proteins influence sperm-egg binding remains to be investigated.",

For the sperm-egg (zona pellucida) binding assay, gametes were coincubated in a TYH droplet covered with mineral oil (Sigma) for 1 h, washed gently in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. The oocytes were visualized (magnification, \u00d7200) under a light microscope (Olympus) and the number of sperm was counted at a focus showing the widest diameter of eggs. The numbers of oocytes examined were 18 in buffer only without reagents, 20 with wild-type ACE, 17 with ACE-E414D, 18 with PI-PLC, 18 with PI-PLC + inositol-P, and 17 with inositol-P alone. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results. All animal experiments were performed under approval of the Osaka University Animal Experiment Committee.",
