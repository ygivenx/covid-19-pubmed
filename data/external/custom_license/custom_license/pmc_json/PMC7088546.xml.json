            "text": "Zoonosis can be referred to as the transmissible diseases between vertebrate animals and humans (WHO 1959), which comprises 75 % of emerging infectious diseases (Taylor et al. 2001). Therefore, successful management of zoonotic diseases risks and outbreaks require the understanding of the complex interaction network of humans, animals and their living environments (WHO 2013b). Previous bibliometric studies on relevant topics either investigated specific infectious diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Patra and Chand 2007; Uthman 2008), tuberculosis (Ramos et al. 2008), and malaria (Garg et al. 2009) or examined infectious diseases in general (Bliziotis et al. 2005; Ramos et al. 2004, 2009; Takahashi-Omoe and Omoe 2012). The latter studies examined the research productivity and contribution of different countries and regions of the world in infectious diseases showing a gradual increase in research on infectious diseases in the US, the EU and other regions in the world. Our investigation focuses on the contribution and collaboration of countries in exploring the intersection between animal and human health. We provide an investigation of the dynamics of zoonotic research networks over 33 years by constructing and using large scientometric data.",

Larger circles and labels represent more important nodes in terms of their weight (van Eck and Waltman 2013). The weight of the nodes in the countries networks in our study are determined based on the number of other countries associated with them and the strength of the associations. The color of the circles also depicts the cluster the node belongs to (van Eck and Waltman 2013). The density view is helpful for identifying the most important areas of a map. In this view, the nodes are represented with the same label structure as the label view. The color of the point a node is placed in depends on the number of nodes around that point and their weights (i.e. their density). More nodes with greater weight neighboring a node lead to greater density for that node. According to the default color scheme used by VOSviewer, three color (red\u2013green\u2013blue) represent density where red and blue are assigned to the highest and lowest densities respectively (van Eck and Waltman 2010).",

While before 1991, the number of extracted publications is constantly low, an increasing trend starts after that. This increase in the number of publications continues gradually and accelerates after 2002. This observation provides three time intervals to examine detail changes in the collaboration networks including 1980\u20131990, 1991\u20132001, and 2002\u20132012. The dynamic analysis in this study focuses on the last two time intervals as the number of publications in the first period is limited.\n",

It seems that the output of scientific research in the zoonotic disease outbreaks have reached a saturation level since 2006 and only occurrence of global disease outbreaks triggers increases in quantity of the related publications.

The highest amount of collaborations (324 distinct links and 569 total occurrences) takes place in 2011 among 71 countries. In 2012, the amount of collaborations drops to 261 distinct collaboration ties while the number of participating countries increases to 80. Since 2006\u20132012 the collaborating countries consist of 53\u201380 countries which are nearly 50 % of all the countries (159) in our database. In other words, the countries collaboration network at its most collaborative status comprises half of the publishing countries. In addition, the trend of recruiting more collaborating countries each year although is overall growing; its pace slows down after 2006. However, the number of collaboration links between the present countries and the frequency of such collaborations shows fast increase (with occasional declines). As such, it seems that after 2006 the community of collaborating countries is more focused on having more collaboration with other existing countries in the community and strengthening these collaborative relationships.\n",
