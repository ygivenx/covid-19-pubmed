            "text": "Despite being a member of the order Carnivora, the domestic dog is omnivorous in nature and consumes a considerable amount of dietary carbohydrate, including fibrous materials, commonly present in commercial pet foods. Dogs do not rely heavily on microbial fermentation as it pertains to energy requirements, but balanced and stable microbiota are critical for maintaining gastrointestinal health. Characterizing the canine microbiome is important for several reasons. First, similar gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology, dietary patterns, metabolic processes and intestinal disease etiology make the dog an effective human model for intestinal health and disease (as reviewed by Swanson and Schook, 2006). Second, most pet dogs in developed countries are now treated as family, with many not only living in the home but also eating, sleeping and playing with their owners. This close proximity has relevance in terms of zoonotic disease. Several recent case reports have demonstrated a direct link between human illness and pet dogs (Ngaage et al., 1999; Sato et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the predominant microbial phyla in the human gut (Eckburg et al., 2005; Gill et al., 2006). Knowledge of the canine gut microbiome lags behind that of humans, but has improved recently with the increased speed and reduced cost of next-generation sequencing technologies (Suchodolski et al., 2009). Recent sequencing data from our laboratories suggest that Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria co-dominate the colon of healthy dogs (Suchodolski et al., 2008a; Middelbos et al., 2010). Suchodolski et al. (2008a) compared small and large intestinal populations and noted that Clostridiales predominated in the duodenum and jejunum, whereas Fusobacteriales and Bacteroidales were the most abundant bacterial order in the ileum and colon. Enterobacteriales were more commonly observed in the small intestine than in the colon, and Lactobacillales were commonly present in all parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal disease is often associated with alterations in small intestinal microbiota, some of which have also been identified in dogs. Results from several recent studies have identified distinct gut microbial populations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease as compared with healthy controls (Xenoulis et al., 2008; Suchodolski et al., 2010; Allenspach et al., 2010). Duodenal samples from dogs with inflammatory bowel disease had reduced species richness, were enriched with the Enterobacteriaceae family and also differed in Clostridiaceae, Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes populations. These recent experiments have provided a strong foundation on which to build, although further experimentation with greater coverage is sorely needed.",

A metagenomics approach is advantageous because it provides a view of community structure (species richness and distribution), including fungi, archaeal and viral genomes, as well as functional (metabolic) potential (Hugenholtz and Tyson, 2008). This strategy will enhance our understanding of host\u2013microbe relationships, with application to host metabolism and disease. Recent metagenome projects have revealed the functional capacity of the gastrointestinal organisms in numerous species, including humans (Kurokawa et al., 2007; Turnbaugh et al., 2009), rodents (Turnbaugh et al., 2006, 2008), cattle (Brulc et al., 2009) and poultry (Qu et al., 2008).

All animal care procedures have been described by Middelbos et al. (2010) and were approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before conducting the experiment. Experimental diets were formulated to meet all nutritional recommendations for adult dogs provided by the Association of American Feed Control Officials, (2009). Primary ingredients of both diets included brewer's rice, poultry by-product meal, poultry fat, dried egg and vitamin and mineral premixes. The control diet (C) contained no supplemental dietary fiber, whereas the fiber-supplemented diet (BP) included 7.5% beet pulp in place of brewer's rice. Control and BP diets were similar in protein (29.7 vs 28.0%), fat (19.4 vs 21.0%) and ash (6.8 vs 7.1%) composition, but contained different fiber concentrations (1.4 vs 4.5% total dietary fiber).

Although it is difficult to identify the source of variation between these methodologies, especially in Fusobacteria, biases involved with the generation of amplicons (for example, primer bias and so on) for the 16S rRNA gene-based method may have contributed to this discrepancy. In another recent study, in which near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were generated from a clone library of healthy canine colon samples, Firmicutes represented \u223c40% of sequences, whereas Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria both represented 30% each (Suchodolski et al., 2008a).

Increased Firmicutes read counts in the current (metagenomic) data set were primarily due to decreased Clostridia in K9BP as compared with K9C, whereas changes in Proteobacteria were primarily related to Gammaproteobacteria. Despite the differences in overall read counts between the metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene-derived data sets, effects of dietary fiber on phylum prevalence were similar between them (Middelbos et al., 2010). Microbial phylogeny is known to respond to dietary alterations, including the amount and type of dietary fiber or other bioactive food components, as demonstrated by recent experiments performed in mice (Turnbaugh et al., 2008), rats (Abnous et al., 2009) and humans (Li et al., 2009b).

Paired data from studies were chosen, such as lean (LMC) and obese (OMC) mouse cecal metagenomes (Turnbaugh et al., 2006) and two human fecal metagenomes (F1S; HSM). F1S was considered to be a healthy human fecal metagenome (Kurokawa et al., 2007), whereas HSM was defined as human feces from a malnourished subject, as well as a chicken cecal metagenome (CCA) (Qu et al., 2008). The results of such comparisons have inherent assumptions on the basis of the methods and version of the database used for generating the data and parameters used to assemble the data. Results were evaluated at the phylogenetic level (Figure 1) and at the metabolic level (Figure 2). Within the phylogenetic comparison based on a double hierarchical dendogram, the two canine samples clustered together and more closely with the healthy human and mouse metagenomes than with the obese mouse metagenome. The chicken cecum metagenome was the greatest outlier as might be expected. In all samples, the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were most abundant. The canine metagenome was most distinguished by its greater prevalence of Fusobacteria as compared with humans and mice, as can be seen in the heat map in Figure 1. The heat map also demonstrates that the canine metagenome contained lower Actinobacteria and greater Fibrobacteres/Acidobacteria as compared with humans and mice. Finally, Spirochaetes were identified in all of the metagenomes, and Firmicutes were notably lower in the chicken cecal metagenome that was largely predominated by Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. Similar clustering against mouse and human data was performed in IMG/M ER (http://merced.jgi-psf.org/cgi-bin/mer/main.cgi). As Supplementary Figure 3 demonstrates, canine samples clustered together and were most similar to human gut samples, which also clustered together, and were followed by lean and obese mouse gut samples.",

(2008) demonstrated in vitro methanogenesis in canine fecal samples, but a phylogenetic characterization of the archaeal phylotypes has not been provided. There is no clear role for archaea in the intestine. Typically, they are considered commensals, but because of mutualistic interactions with other microorganisms they may contribute to pathogenicity (Conway de Macario and Macario, 2009). Methanogens reduce hydrogen into methane, promoting an environment that enhances growth of polysaccharide fermenting bacteria, leading to a higher energy utilization of the diet. Higher numbers of methanogenic archaea have been observed in obese humans (Zhang et al., 2009). Methanogens have also been associated with periodontal disease in humans (Li et al., 2009a).

Only three distinct phylotypes were identified, and all were at low (0.01%) abundance of the canine metagenome: Gibberella zeae PH-1, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, the latter two phylotypes were the only ones identified in the OMC and CCA metagenomes, respectively. Fungi in the intestinal ecosystem have not yet been studied extensively in dogs. Using culture-dependent methods, only a few studies mention the presence of fungi in the canine gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, ileum, colon and rectum, in \u223c25% of dogs (Davis et al., 1977; Benno et al., 1992; Mentula et al., 2005). Using a panfungal PCR assay, a higher prevalence of fungi DNA (76% of dogs) was reported in the proximal small intestine in healthy dogs and in dogs with chronic enteropathies (Suchodolski et al., 2008b). In that study, a total of 51 different phylotypes were identified across 135 dogs, but the species richness within individual dogs was low, with the majority of dogs harboring only one phylotype. Fungi DNA was detected at significantly higher proportion in mucosal brush samples than in luminal content.",

In that study, fungi were observed mostly adjacent to the colonic epithelial cells and to a lesser extent in fecal material. Scanlan and Marchesi, (2008) measured human distal gut fungi using culture-dependent and -independent methods, demonstrating the biases that occur with culture methods. Cultured fungi were predominantly of Candida origin, whereas those identified by molecular techniques included Saccharomyces, Gloeotinia, Penicillium, Candida and Galactomyces. Similar fungi phylotypes (Candida, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Saccharomyces) were identified in stool samples from patients with human inflammatory bowel disease and from healthy controls (Ott et al., 2008). In that study, fungi represented a low percentage (0.3%) of the overall fecal flora. Colon biopsy samples contained a much greater diversity of fungi, with nearly five times more operational taxonomic unit reported in biopsies compared with stool samples (Ott et al., 2008). We observed a low number of fungi phylotypes in dogs in this study. It is possible that fungi constitute only a minor fraction of the gut metagenome and the true diversity has been underestimated in this study. Deeper sequencing efforts will likely yield a more accurate characterization of the fungi ecosystem. It is also possible that fungi are less prevalent in luminal content and fecal material, compared with mucosal samples, as previously shown in dogs, mice and humans (Scupham et al., 2006; Ott et al., 2008; Suchodolski et al., 2008b), and have been therefore underestimated in this study.",

In dogs, the knowledge about the presence of viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract is limited to a few families (including rotavirus, coronavirus and parvovirus). Recent studies in humans revealed that the viral community in the gastrointestinal tract is highly diverse, with several hundred different phylotypes (Breitbart et al., 2003). It is likely that a similar diverse viral community is present in dogs and cats, but their in-depth characterization will require deeper sequence coverage.

Although these genes comprise a very small percentage of the total gene number identified (0.34% of sequences for K9C; 0.17% for K9BP), it suggests that the microbiota are being exposed to different carbohydrate concentrations when fed diets of different types or amounts of fiber substrates.

A high sequence number for multidrug efflux pumps was noted in both groups, with a numerically greater prevalence in K9C (1.65%) as compared with K9BP (1.51%). In Gram-negative bacteria, these pumps provide protection by actively exporting antimicrobial substances, and serve as one mechanism by which these bacteria can survive in the presence of antibiotics (Poole, 2005). Several classes of multidrug efflux pumps exist, but all have great relevance to bacterial physiology, including antibiotic resistance, and are common drug targets (Vila and Martinez, 2008). This class of genes will continue to have great application not only in canine health but also in that of humans as well, and is an area that deserves more attention in the future. Other resistance-related genes having the greatest sequence number were those associated with acriflavine (0.35% for K9C; 0.38% for K9BP), cobalt-zinc-cadmium (0.52% for K9C; 0.53% for K9BP) and fluoroquinolones (0.50% for K9C; 0.47% for K9BP). Acriflavine is a common antiseptic agent and its resistance is thought to be due to an overexpression of efflux pump genes. The broad-spectrum antibiotics fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and enrofloxacin, are commonly used in human and canine medicine, respectively. Sequences pertaining to Ton and Tol transport systems were also highly prevalent in both groups (1.01% for K9C; 0.97% for K9BP). The Ton system is an energy transducer and uses the transmembrane electrochemical gradient for nutrient uptake, whereas the Tol system is energy independent and seems to preserve the cellular envelope (Muller et al., 1993). These transport systems are involved in the uptake of numerous nutrients (for example, vitamin B12; iron), and also serve as a mechanism by which bacteriocins translocate into and kill competing bacteria (Alonso et al., 2000). Finally, a few sequences for genes associated with iron scavenging were present, but very few pertained to adhesion or invasion mechanisms. Genes most prevalent in the cell wall and capsule subsystem were associated with biosynthesis of peptidoglycan (1.35% for K9C; 1.13% for K9BP), KDO2-Lipid A (0.65% for K9C; 0.63% for K9BP) and LOS core oligosaccharides (0.45% for K9C and K9BP). Rhamnose containing glycans (0.34% for K9C; 0.33% for K9BP) and sialic acid metabolism (0.73% for K9C; 0.69% for K9BP) also had a high prevalence.",

Because this experiment used a crossover design in a research setting, dogs and housing environment were constant, leaving diet as the only difference between samples. Thus, it may not be surprising that the prevalence of each functional group was very similar between the two canine samples. The heat map also demonstrates that the canine metagenome clustered most closely with the two human metagenomes, followed by the chicken cecum metagenome. The two mouse samples clustered together and were most different than canine samples. Interestingly, mouse samples had an enrichment of genes associated with phosphorus metabolism as compared with the other metagenomes. The chicken metagenome had a greater sequence number associated with sulfur metabolism, and fewer sequences associated with fatty acids and lipids, cell division and cell cycle and motility and chemotaxis.",

Our data demonstrate that the dominant bacterial phyla of the gut microbiome (for example, Bacteroidetes; Firmicutes) are similar to those of humans and rodent models. Archaea, fungi and viral sequences represented a minor portion of all sequences, but were present at levels similar to that of other mammalian biomes. Primary functional categories were also similar to those of other mammalian gut microbiomes and were associated with carbohydrates; protein, DNA and RNA metabolism; vitamin and cell-wall component biosynthesis; and virulence. Hierarchical clustering of gut metagenomic data from dogs, humans and mice demonstrated high phylogenetic and metabolic similarity among species. Although some alterations due to the inclusion of dietary fiber were noted, more drastic dietary changes (for example, source, type, or amount of macronutrients, including protein and dietary fiber) are likely needed to result in large effects in the canine gut metagenome. Although this experiment has provided a brief overview of the canine gut community, future studies are required to provide a deeper coverage and greater characterization of the metagenome of dogs in healthy and diseased states, of varying ages or genetic backgrounds, and/or receiving specific dietary interventions.",
