However, in the strictest sense (which we adopt here), the term implies a series of infections caused by indistinguishable or closely linked isolates, which are sufficiently similar to justify talking about 'an outbreak strain'. Such outbreaks can range in size from a few individuals, for instance in a family outbreak or an outbreak on a hospital ward, to epidemics that rage across countries or continents.",

A key question surfaces at the start of any such investigation: is one really seeing an outbreak in the strictest sense, caused by a single strain, or is one merely seeing an increased incidence of infection, involving multiple unrelated strains? The answer to this question is of more than academic interest, as it dictates how the finite resources available for infection control are best deployed. For example, evidence of cross infection with a single methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain on a ward might prompt an aggressive strategy of patient isolation and decolonization, whereas an increase in infections caused by diverse staphylococcal strains (presumably each derived from the patient's own microbiota) might prompt a look at policies for wound care or antibiotic usage. Similarly, identification and characterization of an outbreak strain or the discovery of its source or mode of transmission influences the behavior of the infection control team - potential responses include removal of the source, interruption of transmission or strengthening of host defenses.",

Outbreaks are often linked to social factors, including mass travel, migration, conflict or societal breakdown, or to environmental threats, such as earthquakes or floods. They can arise from exposure to a common source in the environment (for example, legionellosis arising from a water source); when the period of exposure is brief, these events are termed 'point-source outbreaks'. Alternatively, outbreaks can be propagated by human-to-human spread or, in the case of zoonoses, such as swine or bird flu, can result from the spread to humans from animal reservoirs. Outbreaks can also be classified according to context, for example whether they occur in the community or in healthcare settings, or according to the mode of transmission, for example food-borne, waterborne, airborne or vector-borne.",

In this approach, differences in stretches of DNA sequence from conserved housekeeping genes are used to assign bacterial isolates to sequence types, which, in turn, often fall into larger clonal complexes. Sequence-based approaches bring the advantage of portability; in other words, results from one laboratory can be easily compared with those from others around the world. In addition, archiving of information in national or international datasets allows isolates and outbreaks to be placed in the wider context of pathogen population structure.",

For instance, whereas MLST identified only a single sequence type for a collection of MRSA isolates, WGS identified several distinct clusters [26]. Two recent studies of tuberculosis transmission have shown that the resolution of WGS with SNP typing is much higher than that provided by the previous 'gold standard' typing method, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing [27,28]. WGS also links epidemiology to pathogen biology, delivering unprecedented insights into genome evolution, genome structure and gene content, including information on clinically important markers, such as resistance and virulence genes [11] (Figure 1).",

Interpretation of genomic data requires a detailed knowledge of within-host and between-host genotypic diversity, whether defined at a single time point or longitudinally. Readings from the molecular clock provide the temporal information needed to reconstruct the emergence and evolution of lineages and transmission events within an outbreak. This means that extensive benchmarking will be needed to determine the rates of genomic change, which are likely to be species- and even lineage-specific. Only when WGS data have been obtained from a large number of epidemiologically linked and unlinked cases in a given lineage will it be possible to define cut-offs for the genomic differences that allow linked and unlinked cases to be accurately defined. This may also rely on comparisons with an 'outgroup', that is, a group of cases that clearly fall outside the outbreak cluster.",

However, such data are available for only a very limited number of other pathogens. This will need to be expanded significantly before routine use of WGS data becomes a reality. We suspect that there may be consistent differences in the mode and rate of genotypic change between organisms for which an asymptomatic carrier state (for example C. difficile) or a latent period (M. tuberculosis) exists and those, such as measles, for which there is no carrier state.",

Portable nanopore technologies might provide a route to real-time near-patient testing and environmental sampling, as well as delivering a combined read-out of genotype and phenotype in bacterial cells (perhaps even allowing direct detection of the expression of resistance determinants). It also seems likely that clinical diagnostic metagenomics [30], perhaps equipped with target-specific enhancements such as sorting or capture of cells or DNA, will deliver improved genomic epidemiological information, including insights into within-patient pathogen population genetics and identification and typing of non-culturable or difficult-to-culture organisms.",
