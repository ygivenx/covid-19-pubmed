It was found that the DA strain is highly susceptible to PIA, whereas the E3 strain is resistant, and that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (Pia1) influences the chronicity of the disease. Moreover, analysis of recombinant inbred strains made from DA and E3 showed that the disease is polygenic. To map genes involved in PIA, we made F1 and F2 crosses between the E3 and the DA strains (Table 1). F1 rats developed chronic PIA, indicating dominant genes, but with delayed onset (P<0.0001) and reduced severity ( P<0.0001) compared with the DA parental rats, suggesting incomplete penetrance due to the presence of recessive and/or additive genes. Consistent with earlier reports6, females were more susceptible than males. In the F2 population, the disease course was more variable and examples of the different disease patterns are shown (Fig. 1). All 153 (E3\u00d7DA) F2 rats were subjected to a near-complete genome screen using a set of 330 informative microsatellites. The identified QTLs are summarized (Table 2), and log-likelihood plots ( Fig. 2) as well as chromosomal locations (Fig. 3) are shown.",

As in RA, the distribution of affected joints was predominantly symmetric (85% of the affected joints were symmetric at day 35). A locus on chromosome 6 (Pia3) was linked to the day of arthritis onset, but an indication of linkage was also found on chromosome 4; this linkage became significant (Pia2) when only females were analysed, despite the decrease in power by the reduced number of rats. This indicates that the gene is dependent on a female context. Both loci appear to control a delayed disease onset in a DA recessive mode ( Fig. 4); that is, they contain disease susceptibility genes derived from E3. None of the loci controlling arthritis onset influenced further progression of the disease (Fig. 4).",

DA alleles promoted disease in an additive fashion (data not shown). The strongest linkage was seen with the number of affected paws between day 28 and 35, during a period in which joint erosion was most extensive. As a consequence, high serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were linked to the same region, during the same period, with an identical inheritance pattern at day 35 (Fig. 2). Thus, COMP and number of affected paws on day 35 showed a positive correlation (Rs=0.66,  P<1\u00d710\u20137). We also observed possible, but not significant, influence on arthritis onset and chronicity by Pia4 (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "To identify loci controlling chronicity, we used the number of affected paws at late stages (after 8 weeks) and inflammation scores of joint histopathology sections at a very late stage of arthritis (approximately day 120). These phenotypes were positively correlated (Rs=0.72, P<1\u00d710\u20137), but may reflect different aspects because histopathology was carried out on the most affected paw at the end of the experiment, whereas the number of affected paws takes into account all paws during a longer period. A locus (Pia6) on chromosome 14 was significantly linked to the number of affected paws from day 83 (lod score 4.2), and lod scores increased as the disease progressed with time. When males and females were analysed separately, an additional locus on chromosome 4 (Pia5) associated with inflammation scores was found in males. Loci linked to chronicity (Pia5 and  Pia6; Fig. 2f,g,h) were not associated with onset or severity of arthritis (Fig. 4). Our analysis showed that the DA strain has a recessive disease-promoting allele at  Pia6 and an additive allele at Pia6 (Fig. 4). One of the loci controlling chronicity, Pia5, is located in the vicinity of the previously described Cia3 locus, which controls collagen-induced arthritis7, and the Lyp/Iddm1 locus, which is associated with lymphopenia, diabetes and thyroiditis in the BB rat8,9 (Fig. 3). This may indicate the presence of a common susceptibility gene for several autoimmune diseases. The MHC region has been found to control the development of chronic arthritis in PIA using LEW congenic strains6, and the designation Pia1 is therefore reserved for this locus. Pia1 was, however, not found in the present cross, possibly due to the fact that none of the parental strains had the most susceptible haplotype (RT1f).",

These were selected from the phenotypic extremes. Although improper location of some of the markers used caused difficulty, these markers could be positioned with high probability using additional F2 offspring from other crosses based on the DA and E3 strains. Thus, an improved genetic map was constructed (http://www.cmb.lu.se/contrib/avd-0/e-avd-0.html; N.N. et al., manuscript submitted). Linkage analysis was performed using all determined phenotypic scores (that is, including zero values) and regions for which lod scores exceeded 1.5 were typed for the remaining animals, including more markers where needed.",
