In nature, filoviruses are transmitted by physical contact between infected individuals, presumably via infected bodily fluids2. Initial filovirus disease manifestations include fever, headache, vomiting and diarrhoea3. Fatal cases are characterized by viraemia, elevated liver-associated enzyme levels, coagulopathy and haemorrhage. Filovirus disease outbreaks occur sporadically, most frequently in sub-Saharan Africa, with reported case fatality rates exceeding 90% (ref. 1). In 2012, simultaneous outbreaks involved MARV, SUDV and BDBV, an emergent filovirus isolated in 20074. The historical occurrence of independent and simultaneous emergence of distinct filoviruses highlights the need for the identification and development of an efficacious broad-spectrum antiviral product.",

            "text": "BCX4430, a novel nucleoside analogue (Fig. 1a), was synthesized (Supplementary Information) as part of a small-molecule library designed as inhibitors of viral RNA polymerase activity. BCX4430 is designed to inhibit viral RNA polymerase activity indirectly through non-obligate RNA chain termination, a mechanism requiring anabolism of the parent compound to BCX4430-triphosphate (BCX4430-TP). Then, after pyrophosphate cleavage, incorporation of BCX4430-monophosphate (BCX4430-MP) into nascent viral RNA strands would be expected to cause premature termination of transcription and replication of viral RNA. In support of this proposed mechanism, BCX4430 is rapidly phosphorylated to BCX4430-TP in cultured cell lines and primary hepatocytes, similar to the natural adenosine nucleoside (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Addition of BCX4430 reduces expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in an artificial EBOV minigenome replicon assay (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), in which virion structural proteins comprising the viral ribonucleoprotein complex mediate transcription and replication of an RNA replicon template containing a GFP-reporter cassette. BCX4430-TP inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA polymerase transcriptional activity in a cell-free, isolated enzyme transcription assay (Fig. 1d) (an isolated filovirus RNA polymerase enzyme assay has yet to be reported) and induces premature termination of RNA chain synthesis by HCV RNA polymerase during template-directed primer-extension assays (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). In virus-infected cells, BCX4430 reduces surface-expressed MARV and EBOV glycoprotein and reduces the production of intracellular and extracellular MARV RNA (Fig. 1f\u2013h and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Additionally, HeLa cells incubated with \u226525 \u00b5M BCX4430 produce no detectable infectious MARV virus (concentration providing 90% inhibition (IC90) = 5.4 \u00b5M) (Fig. 1h).",

Findings from primer-extension reactions suggest that termination occurs two bases after incorporation of BCX4430-MP, perhaps as a result of inhibitory stereochemical distortions of the nascent RNA chain. We observed no evidence of BCX4430-MP incorporation into human RNA or DNA on exposing human Huh-7 cells to concentrations of BCX4430 exceeding the MARV IC50 by more than tenfold (Extended Data Fig. 1f). The basis of the selectivity of BCX4430 for viral polymerases is not yet known.",

BCX4430 exhibited antiviral activity against negative-sense RNA viruses representing the Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae and Paramyxoviridae families, and positive-sense RNA viruses of the Flaviviridae and Coronaviridae families (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2). Antiviral effects were specific and did not result from cellular toxicity or anti-proliferative effects, as assessed by enumeration of live cells during all HCI assays and by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. In HeLa cells, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of BCX4430 exceeded 500 \u00b5M as determined by the LDH assay, and consistently exceeded 100 \u00b5M using the HCI-based assay (Table 1). An antiviral effect was confirmed in infected human macrophages cultured from normal peripheral blood monocytes, using EBOV (Extended Data Fig. 1e). It is important to note that immortalized cell lines exhibit a substantially attenuated capacity to convert BCX4430 to its active TP form, compared with primary hepatocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Thus, the results obtained from antiviral assessments relying on immortalized cells may underrepresent the antiviral potency of BCX4430 achievable in vivo during experimental or clinical infections.",

The six infection-control subjects succumbed by day 12 (Fig. 3a), after having developed viraemia (Fig. 3b) and characteristic signs of filovirus disease, including behavioural inactivity, maculopapular rash, increases in liver injury markers such as aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin (Fig. 3c, d), and prolongations of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (Fig. 3e, f). All animals treated with BCX4430 beginning 24 or 48 h after infection survived. Five out of six (83%) animals treated with BCX4430 beginning 1 h after infection survived (Fig. 3a). Consistent with the proposed antiviral mechanism of action, BCX4430 significantly and substantially reduced serum MARV burden (Fig. 3b), without inducing type I interferon responses (Extended Data Fig. 4d), as has been observed for c3-Npc A in mice15. Additionally, BCX4430 ameliorated haemorrhagic disease manifestations, as evidenced by shorter PT and aPTT times and reduced laboratory indices of liver damage, such as serum AST and bilirubin concentrations, compared with vehicle treatment (Fig. 3c\u2013f).",

For the first time, to our knowledge, we report the identification of a small molecule with efficacy against filovirus disease in non-human primates. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other highly virulent RNA viruses (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2). Additional evaluations are in progress to assess the in vivo efficacy of BCX4430 against EBOV and other highly virulent pathogens in non-human primates or other disease models that most closely recapitulate human disease.",

The substantial efficacy of BCX4430 observed with the i.m. route, which provides high bioavailability and rapid absorption, is conducive for use during outbreaks, potentially enabling administration by individuals lacking advanced medical training. In MARV-infected cynomolgus macaques, we did not observe any diminution of protective effects with delay of BCX4430 treatment initiation up to 48 h after infection, suggesting that even greater delays of treatment, yet to be tested, may also yield significant protective benefit. In preparation for advancing BCX4430 into human phase 1 clinical trials in the United States, additional studies are in progress to support filing of an Investigational New Drug Application.",

Replication of EBOV minigenome RNA constructs was assayed by using a plasmid-based reconstituted replication/transcription system25. Inhibition of RNA transcriptional activity was assessed in an isolated HCV polymerase assay26 and inhibition of HCV polymerase RNA synthesis activity was evaluated using a template-driven 32P-GG primer extension assay.

A guinea pig MARV-Musoke parenteral challenge model and virus aerosolization methods used for guinea pig exposures have been previously described19,29. BCX4430 was administered in a vehicle of sterile 0.9% saline for injection for all in vivo applications. Animal infection experiments were performed in biosafety level 4 containment facilities at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). All experimental treatment replication was conducted using biological replication, except for the virus-yield reduction assay (Fig. 1h), which relied on technical replication.",
