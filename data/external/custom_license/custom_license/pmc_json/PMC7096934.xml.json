I won't repeat the points made in your March editorial1 other than to emphasize that the negative consequences of FDA regulation for patients are very real.",

When developed in the laboratory\u2014under federal oversight by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)\u2014these tests can be quickly modified to take advantage of important new important developments in this rapidly advancing field of medical science. FDA's before-marketing review of these laboratory-developed tests would have a chilling effect on this rapid, critically important innovation by subjecting it to another layer of regulation and driving away the investment needed to validate and incorporate test modifications.",

Many tests developed in the laboratory have provided healthcare breakthroughs, especially in infectious disease and cancer. AIDS has been transformed from a deadly disease to a manageable chronic disease in large part because of laboratory-developed tests for diagnosing and managing HIV. Because HIV mutates so rapidly, there are over 20 antiviral drugs for HIV treatment and over 50 more in development.",

They allow treatment to move from a 'one drug suits all' approach to a much more individualized strategy based upon the unique genetic nature of each individual and his or her disease. Tests developed in the lab have also been critical in the nation's public health defense by allowing the identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus, avian flu and West Nile virus. Although many more examples exist, these underscore why laboratory-developed tests and their ability to respond rapidly to new and often menacing health challenges should continue to be allowed within the congressionally established regulatory framework that already exists.",

Because of the small populations that would be available for clinical trial testing, these well-established and medically important tests would not be able to meet FDA requirements, and\u2014with limited markets\u2014could disappear.",

This would have a profound negative impact on healthcare delivery and the practice of medicine and would close an important public health 'safety valve' now provided by laboratory-developed tests. For example, the current ability and flexibility of various laboratories (including those in academic institutions) to respond to emerging medical needs enables them to offer services that would never generate the financial and operational returns necessary to allow broad commercial introduction of an in vitro diagnostic test kit for such conditions. In many cases, no in vitro diagnostic device manufacturer will ever manufacture a kit for such tests. If all laboratories were required to clear their tests with FDA, then many tests simply would not be made available by laboratories, just as they are not offered at present by any kit manufacturer.",

As a Health and Human Services recent report2 on personalized medicine notes, \u201cVenture capital will likely remain the primary source of financing for young innovators in this space [that is, personalized medicine] due to the extraordinary risk associated with investing in healthcare technologies.\u201d The HHS report goes on to suggest that small changes in regulatory policies and reimbursement outlook can have a direct impact on the ability of emerging firms to attract the necessary investment. The emergence of significant new barriers to entry into this market, in the form of new FDA premarketing requirements and the accompanying costs, almost certainly would make it more difficult to attract the needed investment. As a result, the ability of these new companies to succeed would be impeded significantly.",
