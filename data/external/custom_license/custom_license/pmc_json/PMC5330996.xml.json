The LOS requirement ensured that patients had adequate exposure to isolation precautions to potentially affect outcomes of care. Two groups of isolated patients were identified: (1) those placed on droplet precautions for respiratory illnesses and (2) those placed on contact precautions for MRSA. We report on these two groups separately, as patients with MRSA are placed on isolation for a longer period of time than patients with respiratory illnesses; as such, the effect of isolation may be more pronounced in the MRSA cohort. Patients in the isolated cohorts include those who had or were suspected of having an infectious disease prior to hospital admission as well as those with hospital-acquired infections; infections acquired during hospitalization represent only a small proportion of cases. The MRSA cohort included patients who were colonized or infected. Patients with no isolation precautions were eligible as controls.",

A total of nine covariates were included in the model: age, sex, RIW, number of hospital readmissions within 90 days, total LOS for hospital admissions within 90 days, site of admission, month of isolation, year of isolation, and Case Mix Group (CMG). Two-way interactions were included between the first six covariates, and CMG had a factor for each of the 52 most common groups, which accounted for 75 % of observations. These covariates were all selected as important predictors of isolation for infection control. Controls for each isolated case were sampled with replacement by nearest-neighbor matching using a caliper width of 0.1 standard deviations of the logit of the propensity score.29\n\u2013\n31 With this approach, isolated patients are randomly ordered, and the first isolated patient is selected and matched to the control patient with the closest propensity score that is within the caliper. If multiple controls are almost equally close to the case, they are all selected and re-weighted to reflect the number of matches. This approach estimates what is called the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT); here, ATT is the effect of isolation on patients who are characteristic of those actually isolated.32 Two other effects that could have been estimated, the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in controls, are of little interest, as they would estimate the effect of isolation in patient groups where isolation is much less likely. Covariate balance between cohorts was assessed graphically and by the standardized difference; meaningful imbalance is indicated by an absolute standardized difference of 0.10.33\n",

We calculated means and percentages for the covariates in the matched and unmatched cohorts. Summaries and comparisons of outcomes were one of three types. Binary outcomes (mortality, readmissions, ED visits, and adverse events) were summarized as percentages and compared with the risk difference. Our continuous outcomes (those related to cost and LOS) were all right-skewed and were summarized by geometric means and compared by the ratio of means. Complaints and adverse events were summarized as rates (number per 100 patient-days) and compared with the difference in rates. All estimates of effects were accompanied by 95 % confidence intervals and p values. Model diagnostics were performed to ensure that all model assumptions were valid. Two-tailed p values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using R software (Vienna, Austria), and matching and estimation of the effects of isolation used the Match package.34\n",

First, stratification involved grouping all isolated patients and all controls into ten strata based on the same propensity score used in our main analysis. Second, we used nearest-neighbor matching without replacement and used only the nearest control to each case to obtain 1:1 matches. The third approach used the package \u2018twang\u2019 in R to estimate the propensity score with generalized boosted regression trees (Table 1).35 To obtain the ATT, isolated patients were given a weight of 1, and all control patients were given a weight of ps/(1 \u2212 ps), where ps is the patient\u2019s propensity score. The effects of isolation were estimated in weighted regression models. We examined the consistency of results across methods, but present full results only for the nearest-neighbor matching within a 0.1 caliper width.

Additionally, the literature suggests that MRSA infections lead to worse outcomes, higher costs, and longer lengths of stay than those observed for methicillin-susceptible infections\u2014thus, some of the negative outcomes here may be due to the underlying infection and/or an inherent but unmeasured difference in patient status, and not the isolation practice itself.38\n,\n39 Another limitation noted in \u2018Methods\u2019 is that the practice of isolation for infection control differs between sites. At sites 1 and 2, respiratory (droplet and contact) precautions are used for patients admitted with fever and respiratory symptoms; at site 3, patients with respiratory or fever with cardiac symptoms are tested for respiratory viruses on admission, whereas droplet and contact precautions are used only for patients with influenza. Additionally, the sites differ in their requirement for hospital staff to wear masks when caring for patients colonized or infected with MRSA. Finally, we acknowledge that data for 30-day hospital readmissions are limited to the hospital the patient was originally discharged from. However, in our region, two-thirds of readmissions are to the same site as the initial hospitalization.40 Moreover, the potential for missing readmission data should be equally distributed across both isolated and non-isolated patients.",
