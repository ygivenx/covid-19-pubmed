However, producing large-enough quantities of such antibodies is economically and logistically challenging. In a new study, Luke et al. use transchromosomic (Tc) bovines to produce human anti-MERS-CoV antibodies that show efficacy in vitro and in a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection.",

Tc bovines were vaccinated every 21\u201328 days on five occasions (V1\u2013V5) with WKVV or SPNV. Two human polyclonal IgG products \u2014 named SAB-300 or SAB-301, respectively \u2014 were purified from the hyperimmune plasma collected from the animals after V2, V3, V4 and V5. In vitro, pre-treatment of Jordan strain MERS-CoV with SAB-300 or SAB-301 before culturing with Vero E6 kidney epithelial cells markedly reduced virus-induced cytopathy, implying that these antibodies neutralize MERS-CoV.",

Levels of MERS-CoV-specific RNA transcripts in the Raji cells 48 hours later were not increased by pre-treatment with either SAB-300 or SAB-301, implying that these treatments do not facilitate virus entry into these cells.",

The authors intraperitoneally injected Ad-hDPP4 mice with SAB-301 or a control human IgG and, 12 hours later, intranasally infected them with MERS-CoV. By day 5 post-infection, viral titers in the lung of SAB-301-treated mice, but not of controls, were below the limit of detection. SAB-301 treatment of Ad-hDPP4 mice 24 hours after MERS-CoV exposure also reduced lung viral titers 5 days later to below the limit of detection. Thus, a single treatment of SAB-301 can be effective either prophylactically or after exposure to MERS-CoV.",
