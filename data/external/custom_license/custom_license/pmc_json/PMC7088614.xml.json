The Global Initiative for Asthma defines asthma as \u201ca chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\u201d [1].",

Inevitably, misdiagnosed cases lead to overtreatment or inappropriate treatment and thus to increased risk of side effects without any pharmacologic benefit [3].",

            "text": "Several long-term cohort studies in children with asthma symptoms who were monitored into adulthood have provided important new information about the origins of the deficits in lung function present in patients with asthma [13]. In the classic Melbourne cohort, children 7 years of age were recruited, and investigators showed that their deficits in lung function tracked from childhood to mid-adult life (42 years) [13, 14]. Similar outcomes were shown in the Dunedin birth cohort study. Unselected newborns were monitored up to age 26 years, and those individuals with persistent asthma and reduced lung function had had lower pulmonary function at 9 years of age [15]. The Tucson Children\u2019s Respiratory Study sought to determine whether the deficits in lung function during the early school years were present in newborns or acquired during the course of the disease [16]. In this study, the transient wheezers (wheezers during the first 3 years of life, but not at 6 years) showed reduced lung function prior to the first respiratory illness. Maternal smoking without a family history of asthma was commonly found in this group of children. An antenatal remodeling process has been proposed [7, 17]. The late-onset wheezers (wheezing starting after age 3 years and persisting until age 6 years) were associated with maternal asthma, male sex, and a history of allergic rhinitis. This group tended to be atopic and showed normal lung function at birth and throughout adolescence [16]. Finally, children who wheezed during the first 3 years of life and were still wheezing at age 6 years (persistent wheezers) were also at risk of continued wheezing beyond that age and up to young adult life. In these patients, lung function was lightly, but not significantly, lower at birth. It became significantly lower at age 6 years and tracked up to 16 years. They had an association with allergic sensitization and a family history of asthma [13].",

The first phenotype is the most common in preschool children, with the child feeling well between episodes. It is associated with clinical evidence of viral respiratory tract infections (rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, and adenovirus). The frequency and severity of the episodes are associated with the severity of the first one, atopic markers, prematurity, and exposure to tobacco smoke. The second phenotype, multiple-trigger wheeze, has exacerbations induced by virus infection but also other triggers, such as tobacco smoking and allergen exposure [7]. The clinical application of these phenotypes is not clear, as many of the phenotypes are based on retrospective questionnaires. The classification of phenotypes is likely to change significantly within a 1-year period (54.1% of children changed their phenotype) [21]. From a clinician\u2019s perspective, another wheezing classification was proposed: 1) allergic wheeze, 2) nonallergic wheeze due to structural airway narrowing, and 3) nonallergic wheeze due to increased immune response to viral infection [10]. More recently, a phenotype characterized among overweight/obese girls with early menarche was proposed. These girls start wheezing from puberty without any previous lung function reduction. The authors hypothesized that the origin could be an alteration in the regulation of the bronchial tone associated with hormonal changes [22].",

            "text": "The role of virus infections in the inception of wheezing in children is widely recognized and may explain the link between early-life wheezing and subsequent asthma, particularly in children who develop allergy. Long-term follow-up studies have suggested that deficits in interferon-\u03b3 responses in the first year of life predispose individuals to recurrent episodes of wheezing from preschool age through adolescence. Persistent wheezers had significantly higher serum IgE levels during the acute phase of the lower respiratory illness (LRI) as compared with the convalescence period, whereas no change in total serum IgE was observed in transient wheezers. An acute eosinophilic response was only present in transient wheezers, not in persistent wheezers. All these studies indicate the immunologic involvement in the pathogenesis of early wheezing and asthma later on [23]. Another investigation among children at high risk of asthma and allergies showed that those who had confirmed rhinovirus LRI during the first 3 years of life were up to ten times more likely to have asthma in their early school years than those who never had an LRI. In addition, children with LRI due to RSV were four times more likely to have asthma at age 6 years than those who did not have an RSV LRI [24]. Asthma at 5 years of age was four times more likely to develop in children who had wheezy illnesses due to rhinovirus or RSV in early life than in those who did not. This association was mainly observed among children who became sensitized to allergens younger than 2 years of age [25]. In a study conducted in Finland, subsequent wheezing and later asthma, including relapsing asthma in young adults, was associated with bronchiolitis with early-life wheezing. This was more common if the first wheezing episode was not caused by RSV [26].",

A positive API by age 3 years was associated with a 76% chance of active asthma from age 6 to 13 years, compared with a less than 5% chance of active asthma in the school years in those children with a negative API at age 3 years [31]. In a different survey, four main risk factors were identified: 1) family history of asthma, 2) recurrent chest infections in infancy, 3) absence of nasal symptoms at the age of 2 years, and 4) atopic sensitization at age 4 years. Parental smoking also was found to be an important environmental risk factor associated with persistent wheezing during childhood [32].",

Because the FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio decreases as asthma severity increases, it is suggested that the FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio may be a more sensitive measurement of impairment in children [31].

Clinical approach, predicting tests (eg, API), and a trial of bronchodilators or glucocorticosteroids are still helpful.
