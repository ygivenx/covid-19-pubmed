While there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that this is also the case in tropical regions,\n6\n, \n7\n tropical and developing countries remain under\u2010represented in global surveillance data, and there is limited information available that can be used to inform influenza vaccination and treatment strategies in resource\u2010poor settings, such as Africa. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, no virological and very limited epidemiological data were available to demonstrate the patterns of circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses before 2000,\n8\n and the etiology of respiratory infections, especially in children, was assumed to be of bacterial origin.\n9\n, \n10\n As a result, sentinel surveillance was established in 2003 to characterize influenza viruses in circulation in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, to determine influenza seasonality and to contribute viruses from Africa into the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. During the surveillance years of 2009\u20132010, a subset of sentinel respiratory specimens from children under age 5 years were tested for additional respiratory viruses to also evaluate other viral etiologies of pediatric influenza\u2010like illness. In this study, we use 8 years (2003 through 2010) of sentinel surveillance data to describe the circulation and seasonality of influenza in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.",

These sites were selected in 2003 using the following criteria: geographic representation within Abidjan; adequate throughput of patients consulting at the health facility; the existence of a department of general medicine, a pediatric department, and a laboratory; the accessibility of the site; the availability and the desire of the physicians to participate voluntarily without financial motivation in the surveillance program; and availability of a refrigerator (+4\u00b0C) for the storage of specimens. The surveillance system in Abidjan was expanded to 14 sites in 2007. Twelve additional sites were added during 2008 through 2010, of which five were located in Abidjan and nine were located in the interior of the country with an emphasis on the eastern region, which is a focus of local poultry husbandry (Figure 1). General practitioners and pediatricians were trained on respiratory specimen collection, storage, and shipment of specimens to the laboratory. Supervisory visits were conducted quarterly to monitor the performance of each sentinel site, including validation of total respiratory specimens collected against review of medical records to determine the actual number of ILI cases presenting to sentinel facilities.",

Additional work to highlight the burden of influenza among persons with more severe illness by age (e.g. hospitalized illness), and the impact of influenza in persons with underlying and chronic conditions, is needed to highlight subpopulations that might be prioritized for vaccination and antiviral treatment. For this reason in 2009, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire expanded the sentinel system to include hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Over time, this system, in combination with the existing ILI surveillance, will help to further identify persons at risk of complications of influenza.

This highlights the challenges of establishing sentinel site surveillance and demonstrates that the feasibility of a sentinel site to participate in a surveillance system in terms of administrative and clinical staff commitment, political willingness, and logistics of data collection and specimen transfer is critical to consider when selecting sentinel sites. It is also therefore possible that specific populations, and pockets of influenza activity, may not have been captured by this sentinel system\u2014especially during the early years of surveillance prior to the implementation of molecular diagnostic techniques in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.",

Although this surveillance permitted us to collect our first data on the circulation of influenza viruses in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, during this period there was limited motivation among medical doctors to sustain the activity. This could be explained by increased workload, and perceptions of influenza as a benign or \u2018mild\u2019 disease, which was not seen at the time as a priority in terms of public health. For these reasons, our assessment of influenza seasonality was limited to the years 2007\u20132010 when data were consistently reported from multiple sentinel sites. A critical line of work for the sub\u2010Saharan African Region is to identify better ways to provide incentives to over\u2010extended clinicians to participate in sentinel surveillance. In this regard, the development of sensitive rapid diagnostic tests that may be used in the clinic and hospital setting could better allow surveillance to inform clinical management and increase its relevance to participating clinicians.",
