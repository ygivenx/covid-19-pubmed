From the sequence comparison, it is evident that HIGV is a new member of the genus Phlebovirus and that it is most closely related to the newly discovered zoonotic members of the genus, SFTSV and HRTV. This finding was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide and protein sequences of all 3 genome segments (representative trees shown in Figure 2). Because HIGV was isolated from ticks collected from healthy and diseased birds we believed it was unlikely that the virus was the causative agent for the disease in the shy albatrosses. To further confirm this, we conducted ELISA and Western blot analysis using a recombinant HIGV nucleocapsid protein, which was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by using previously described methods (14,15). Of the 38 serum samples tested, none produced positive readings in ELISA or Western blot. In addition, none were positive when tested by HIGV-specific quantitative PCR targeting the polymerase gene of the large segment.",
