Bird meats were the source of 9 virus-containing samples (5 quail, 2 moor hens, and 2 water cocks), which indicates a risk for influenza virus (H5N1) contamination in bird meats, especially quail. In addition, 3 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were isolated from healthy live poultry (1 chicken and 2 ducks). However, the samples that contained influenza virus subtype H5N1 were detected only during the 3-month winter season (November\u2013January). A possible explanation for virus contamination in live bird and food markets may be animal movement from outbreak areas to the markets as well as an attempt to sell infected (dead or dying) birds, especially quail, as bird meat. In addition, most animals or meats in the markets came from backyard farms, where they were in unavoidably close contact with wild birds.",

In contrast, they differed from influenza subtype H5N1 viruses of the south China and Indonesia lineages (clade 2) (Figure 2). In this study, we did not discern any Thailand isolates closely related to the south China lineage, as previously established in Lao and Cambodia (5).

The HA cleavage site consists of multiple basic amino acids RERRRKKR (in 1 isolate, CU-329, REKRRKKR). All influenza subtype viruses harbor Glu-222 and Gly-224 at the receptor binding site, indicating preferential binding to the avian receptor SA-\u03b1-2, 3-Gal. In addition, the virus sequences contain 7 glycosylation sites as previously identified in most isolates from Thailand (6). A glycosylation site adjacent to receptor binding sites may help increase virus infectivity in host cells (7). In some isolates, polymorphisms of amino acids related to antigenic properties of the viruses at position V86A, L138Q, and K140N were observed. All 12 subtype H5N1 viruses had a 20-aa deletion in the NA protein, typical for the NA stalk region of recent subtype H5N1 isolates (2003\u20132007) (8,9). None of the subtype H5N1 isolates had any amino acids indicating oseltamivir resistance at the crucial positions 119 (E), 275 (H), 293 (R), and 295 (N) of the NA protein. In summary, the 12 viruses isolated from this study were similar to the viruses from other sources in Thailand, which indicates that the viruses are endemic to Thailand, are circulating in the country, and can be found in any exposed species.",
