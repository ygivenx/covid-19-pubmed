            "text": "Baculoviruses (BVs) are dsDNA viruses that naturally infect insects and arthropods and are unable to replicate in mammalian or other vertebrate cells [3, 8, 32]. The recombinant BV expression system in insect cells was developed for protein expression in the 1980s and has since been used in a wide range of applications because many proteins require folding, subunit assembly, and extensive posttranslational modification to be biologically active [18, 54, 57]. This expression system is highly effective in producing large quantities of recombinant viral capsid and envelope proteins that spontaneously assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) inside the cytoplasm of infected insect cells [18, 33, 42, 54]. These VLPs are morphologically and antigenically similar to native viruses [33] but lack the replicative capacity of the virus, are non-infectious, and do not contain any genetic material. VLPs, moreover, are commonly stable in storage and relatively acid and heat stable [5, 19, 33]. VLPs provide a valuable alternative in the development of diagnostic assays for immunological and epidemiological studies.",

VLPs have been demonstrated to be highly effective in stimulating adaptive B- and T cell immune responses in mice [19, 37, 62].

NoVs cause approximately 1 million hospitalizations annually and more than 200,000 deaths worldwide in children under 5 years of age [22, 46]. Most NoVs affecting humans belong to two genogroups (GI and GII), and these two genogroups are divided into at least 8 GI and 17 GII genotypes [66].

VLPs used for research purposes are commonly purified by density gradient centrifugation based on separation by size [5, 9, 16, 24, 28, 33, 50]. These methods result in particles with a purity greater than 80 % [19] but do not readily discriminate between VLPs and BVs [17, 47]. Therefore, BV is likely to be present in many of these preparations, and moreover, BVs have been shown to have an adjuvant effect\u2014especially live BVs [27, 51]. Purification procedures based on chromatography have been shown to remove the contaminating BV in VLP preparations [35, 36, 43, 60, 61]. The purification technique affects the structural characteristics, immunogenicity, morphological integrity, antigenicity and functionality of purified VLPs [13, 28, 35, 45].",

In addition, a weaker band in the preparation of NoV capsid VLPs and mock BV, indicated by an arrowhead, was detected, corresponding to the size of the BV envelope gp64 protein (Fig. 1A, lanes a and b). No other proteins derived from BV or Sf9 cells were observed in the VLP preparation. Confirmation of protein identity in the VLP preparation was performed by immunoblotting using NoV GII-4-specific and BV gp64-specific monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the staining was confirmed using a mixture of these monoclonal antibodies to stain a Sf9 cell lysate, with a negative result. In addition, EM analysis of the protein samples (Fig. 1C), in addition to NoV VLPs of approximately 40 nm in size, revealed the presence of residual rod-shaped BVs in the preparation.\n",

Fractions 15\u201317 were completely negative when analyzed by immunoblot using BV gp64-specific monoclonal antibody, indicating the absence of BV contamination (data not shown). Further optimization of the steps of the purification process were undertaken to improve the yield of the pure NoV capsid protein. First, different concentrations of NaCl (0.5 M, 1 M and 1.5 M) were used to test the effect of the ionic strength of the elution buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4). Second, the concentration of the protein sample loaded onto the column was also optimized. The best purity and yield were obtained with 50 mM Na2HPO4-0.5 M NaCl buffer, and the optimum amount of crude purified VLPs was 500 \u03bcg/column (data not shown). After the first anion exchange chromatography step, fractions 15\u201317 were pooled and applied to the second, fresh column. The analysis of collected fractions of the second anion exchange chromatography is shown in Fig. 3A. The three fractions (15\u201317) containing NoV VLPs were collected, pooled, dialyzed against PBS and sterile-filtered. Immunoblotting of each fraction confirmed the lack of BV gp64 impurities (Fig. 3B).\n\n",

The results showed doublets of NoV capsid proteins [28] without detectable degradation products. Probing with a BV-gp64-specific monoclonal antibody did not detect any BV gp64 protein (Fig. 4B). Densitometric analysis of the SDS-PAGE confirmed that the NoV VLPs were >90 % pure. The presence of live BV was analyzed as well. As seen in Fig. 4C, duplicate wells of the purified VLP sample completely lacked live BVs in contrast to the mock BV sample wells, which contained ~109 pfu/ml live BV, as determined using a BacPak Rapid Titer Kit. The total DNA content in the pure VLP sample was also quantified, and some residual DNA was detected, but the DNA content was very low (0.41 ng/\u03bcl). In addition, the genomic BV DNA was quantified using BV Q-PCR. BacPAK control BV DNA template was used to create a standard curve (Fig. 5). Purified NoV VLPs contained only a few copies of the BV DNA (Table 1; Fig. 5). From the copies of BV DNA in a pure sample, the amount of BV DNA was calculated to be <0.001 pg/\u03bcl.\n\n\n",

The major protein impurity (close to 10 %, determined by densitometric analysis) came from envelope glycoprotein gp64 of BV. The BV gp64 is also linked to adjuvant behavior [2, 23]. gp64 contains a mannose-binding residue, which is expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. Abe et al. [2] have suggested that gp64 recognizes a Toll-like receptor (TLR) and activates the immune response by inducing inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b3 (TNF-\u03b3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The anion-exchange-chromatography-purified NoV VLP preparations were examined for expression-vector-related protein impurities. Densitometrical SDS-PAGE analyses as well as immunoblotting identified NoV capsid protein with >90 % purity and without the traces of BV gp64 protein.",

We used a purification procedure with a combination of two anion exchange chromatography steps in order to minimize impurities and to obtain structurally intact NoV VLPs. Our results show that NoV VLPs purified by two anion exchange chromatography steps retain the structure of the icosahedral capsids and show excellent stability, comparable to density-gradient-purified VLPs (Fig. 4D, E).",

The anion exchange chromatography method is based on adsorption and reversible binding of charged samples. The major DNA impurities in the VLP preparations come from the baculoviral DNA and not the host cells [27]. Abe and colleagues [1] have shown that BV DNA contains unmethylated CpG motifs that induce proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR-9/MYD88-dependent signaling pathway. Another group has also reported that BV DNA may be responsible for the adjuvant properties of BVs [27]. Our results show that the number of copies of BV DNA was extremely low (Fig. 5; Table 1) in the pure NoV VLP preparation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the number of copies of BV DNA in an NoV VLP preparation by the quantitative BV Q-PCR method. The total dsDNA content in the pure NoV VLP preparation was low (0.9 ng/1-\u03bcg dose). In the case of VLP-based vaccine production, the residual DNA needs to be removed to reach acceptable threshold values, typically 10 ng/dose [15]. One group has shown that only live BV was able to stimulate innate immunity, which was not due to the presence of viral DNA [23]. Therefore the presence and quantity of live BVs in the pure VLP preparation were determined. The infectious BV titer was 0 pfu/ml, confirming the complete absence of recombinant live BV in the preparations of pure NoV VLP.",
