Recent studies have successfully identified novel bat viruses on the basis of consensus primers or sequence-independent PCR amplification [2\u20134]. Over 80 virus species have been detected in bats, including several emerging human pathogens (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, Marburg virus and Ebola virus) [5]. Furthermore, some bat species live in close proximity to human habitation, highlighting the potential role of bats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases [6].",

However, the high assay specificity of these methods has limited the detection of divergent or unknown viruses. The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has facilitated metagenomic analyses to simultaneously screen for all viral families. NGS has been successfully applied to detect novel viruses in different types of samples (including lungs, liver, brain, pharyngeal swabs and anal swabs) [7] and is expected to provide more in-depth information on previously unidentified viruses and viral taxonomy. Studies from the US [8, 9], France [10], New Zealand [11] and China [12\u201315] have analyzed the virome profiles of bats with NGS technology and have identified various unknown mammalian viruses. Most of these studies analyzed viral contigs by homogenizing different organs and tissues of bats; however, this approach is restricted by the unclear tissue distribution and route of transmission of bat viruses. The paucity of knowledge on bat-derived viruses warrants more extensive investigation and surveillance of different bat species in various geographic areas. The digestive tract is connected to the outer environment through ingestion of foods and liquids, providing a niche for virus transmission from bats to humans and other animals. Investigation of the virome in fecal samples from bats, and subsequent epidemiological and phylogenetic characterization, of any viruses, would significantly advance our understanding, especially with regards to prevention and management of zoonotic diseases in different geographic regions.",

            "text": "Similarly to previous studies [5\u20138], a considerable number of viral sequence reads could be classified into virus families: plant, fungal, bacterial, insect, archaeal and algal in nature. The identification of insect viruses, fungal viruses and plant viruses presumably corresponds to the habits and habitats of the bats, including insect-eating, cave-dwelling and social stucture. In addition, the identification of phages likely reflects the bacterial flora harbored inside the bats. Since we focused on the putative role of bats in zoonotic disease transmission, only mammalian virus contigs were analyzed further. Similarly to previous studies, most mammalian viruses were typical zoonotic viruses, including viruses classifiable as Influenza virus A, as well as members of the genera Mastadenovirus, Rotavirus, Mamastrovirus, Coronavirus, Hantavirus, Rhabdovirus and Parechovirus, and also members of the family Papillomaviridae. Metagenomic analyses in other studies have identified the full-length sequences of adenoviruses [8, 10, 12, 14], papillomaviruses [13, 14, 27, 28], parvoviruses [8, 13, 29], circoviruses [29], herpesviruses [11] and rotaviruses [12]. However, it is challenging to make specific or direct comparisons with our study due to significant methodological variations; for instance, the sample type (e.g., fresh guano, urine and roost guano), virus enrichment procedures (e.g., nuclease treatment, centrifugation and filtration) and amplification methods and/or high-throughput sequencing platforms [30]. The most important finding of our study was that the influenza A virus and coronavirus sequences we identified in bats shared their highest genetic identity with previous isolates from humans, suggesting possible cross-species transmission. However, contig sequences representing viruses classifiable within the genera Alphapapillomavirus, Betaretrovirus, Alpharetrovirus, Varicellovirus, Cyprinivirus, Chlorovirus and Cucumovirus were also identified that had identities of less than 70% when compared with viruses in existing databases, indicating the possible evolution of novel viral strains.",

Interestingly, we found that the AdV contigs from HN.RL (representing the IVa2 genes) were clustered with human adenovirus-C and shared higher amino acid sequence identity with human adenoviruses than previously reported bat AdVs. This might indicate the possible evolution of novel viral strains. Owing to the limited size and number of contigs generated by Illumina sequencing, conventional PCR assays are warranted to generate longer and more abundant sequences for further phylogenetic analysis [33, 34].",

Second, the possible inter-transmission of PVs to infect two different bat species (Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi) argues against strict host specificity. However, the L1 sequence detected herein was only 450 bp in length, which does not represent the whole of the L1 gene.

Although the genetic relationship of VP7 sequences between the four bat RVA strains and ITA/RRV is relatively distant, they might share a common ancestor.

To better understand the prevalence of RVAs in bats, further molecular and serological investigations with larger sample sizes and more species of adult and neonatal bats in different geographical regions are required.",

In another study only 12 picornavirus-positive respiratory and alimentary specimens were identified from 1108 bats and 18 species [18]. The lack of CVs and PiVs detected in our study may be accounted for by low carrying rates for these two viruses. Other causes might be variations in duration of the virus shedding in feces, or geographical/seasonal/bat species differences.",
