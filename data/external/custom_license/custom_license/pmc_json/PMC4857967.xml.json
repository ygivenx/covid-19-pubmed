Considering UAC (immunoturbidimetric assay) as the reference method, the diagnostic accuracy of dipstick test and UPC (pyrogallol red\u2010 molybdate) was evaluated. UAC reference interval (0\u20100.024) was determined from 60 healthy dogs. Data collected were categorized using different cut\u2010offs for urine specific gravity (1012 or 1030), dipstick proteinuria (30 or 100 mg/dl), UPC (0.2) and UAC (0.024). Diagnostic agreement (Cohen's k coefficient) and Spearman's correlation between dipstick, UPC and UAC were evaluated. The diagnostic accuracy was estimated with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) analysis. Significance level was set at p < 0.05.",

These effects induce glomerular damage, and lead to renal inflammatory processes and fibrosis. Since ET causes vasoconstriction, sodium and water retention, it has the potential to raise blood pressure in kidney patients. Many laboratory animal studies and observations on human clinical patients have proved the pathologic roles of ET in hypertension and various renal disorders. Almost 100% of ET detected in urine is originates from the kidney itself (mostly from medulla). Accordingly, the assessment of urinary ET excretion but not of circulating ET concentration has been strongly suggested as a possible marker of early renal damage.",

In non\u2010hospitalised humans, a certain number of factors that promote the onset of infection with MDR pathogens have been identified: the age of the patient, hospitalisation within the past year, and the administration of antibiotics within the past year. In dogs, it has been demonstrated that the proportion of Escherichia coli isolated from the rectum and resistant to at least one antibiotic increases after more than 3 days hospitalisation in a university intensive care unit. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors associated with MDR E. coli infection of the urinary tract in cats. All cats presenting a E. coli urinary infection between March 2010 and December 2012 at the Centre Hospitalier V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire Fr\u00e9gis (France) were divided into two groups: MDR group and non\u2010MDR group. Isolates that were resistant to \u22653 antimicrobial classes were considered to be MDR. The effects of different variables on the occurrence of a MDR E. coli were evaluated: age, sex, additional diseases, number of antibiotics and number of days of hospitalisation. Fifty\u2010two cats were identified (42 MDR and 10 non\u2010MDR). The number of antibiotic families used within the last 3 months was associated with an increased risk of MDR E. coli urinary infection (p: 0.007). A trend between the number of days of hospitalisation within the last 3 months and an increased risk of MDR E. coli urinary infection was also found (p: 0.090). This study provides evidence that systematic urinary culture with antibiotic sensitivity testing should be recommended when treating urinary tract infection if antibiotics have been prescribed within the past 3 months. Moreover, the selection of MDR bacteria through antibiotic use should be considered as a potential risk associated with treatment.",

In Boxers, renal lesions, termed juvenile nephropathy, have been described, however the literarature on this topic is limited and different theories on the pathogenesis are proposed. In one study, data from 37 Boxers younger than five years were collected retrospectively. The dogs showed azotaemia, inappropriately low urine concentrating ability, and ultrasound or radiographic evidence of abnormal kidneys. Renal histopathological findings included pericapsular and interstitial fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, dilated tubules, sclerotic glomeruli and dystrophic calcification (Chandler, 2007). Another study included seven young Boxers and the authors concluded that the end\u2010stage kidney disease (ESKD) likely was the result of a chronic reflux nephropathy causing segmental hypoplasia (Ask\u2010Upmark kidney) (Kolbj\u00f8rnsen, 2008). The aims of the present study were twofold: to describe the light microscopy lesions in a population of Boxers, and to evaluate the clinical findings and compare them to published data in Boxers and in other dogs with non\u2010specific chronic kidney disease (CKD). We retrospectively evaluated kidney biopsies and clinical data from seventeen Boxers enrolled between 2005\u20102012 with CKD IRIS stage 1\u20104. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years. The dogs were evaluated by use of biochemistry and CBC, urinalysis, urine culture, blood pressure and renal ultrasound. Clinical data were available for an extended period. Eight dogs had renal lesions associated with juvenile nephropathy based on the presence of immature (fetal) glomeruli. The histopathological findings included increased of mesangial matrix and cells, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. No immune deposits were observed excluding immune mediated origin of the disease. The most striking features were high number of cystic glomerular atrophy and the alteration in the morphology of the glomeruli characterized by severe podocyte hypertrophy and splitting of the Bowman's capsule with multiple synechiae. Three dogs had Leishmania, one dog had renal lymphoma, and one dog had chronic urinary tract infection. Four dogs had nonspecific ESKD. Clinicopathological findings were characteristic of progressive CKD, with PU/PD, weight loss, anorexia, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea, anemia and hyperphosphatemia. Nine dogs were hypertensive; 16 dogs were proteinuric (UPC>0.5) (range 0,75 to 8,85). Fourteen dogs had isosthenuria and 6 dogs had cylinduria. Average plasma creatinine at the time of biopsy was 5,75 mg/dl (508.3 \u03bcmol/l). The pathophysiology of juvenile renal disease in Boxers needs further elucidation.",

Chelation therapy with D\u2010penicillamine is the initial treatment of choice.

KM curves, Cox\u2010regression analysis or logistic regression models were used for prognostic factor analysis.The median all\u2010cause survival of deceased WHWTs with IPF (13/15) from onset of symptoms was 27 months (range 2\u201051 months) and the median IPF\u2010specific survival (7/15) was 32 months (range 2\u201051 months).

No significant prognostic factors were identified. Four of the five dogs euthanized due to acute dyspnea had diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs.IPF had a negative impact on life expectancy of WHWTs, but individual survival varied considerably.

The aim of this study was to evaluate time to normalisation of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPPT) and prothrombin time (PT) after intravenously vitamin K treatment in dogs with naturally anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) intoxication. Inclusion criteria for AR intoxication were: detection of internal or external bleeding, prolonged coagulation times consistent with AR intoxication, exclusion of any other reasons for the clinical bleeding, a complete clinical record, and a coagulation profiles (PT, aPTT, antithrombin%, fibrinogen, FDPs and D\u2010dimer concentration) collected at presentation (T0). Vitamin K was administered at 5 mg/kg intravenously, over 15 minutes, protected from light. Four hours and 8 hours post\u2010vitamin K administration (T4 and T8) a coagulation profile was repeated. Seventy\u2010three dogs with AR poisoning referred to the San Marco Veterinary Clinic met inclusion criteria. aPTT and PT values were compared at T0, T4 and T8 with \u201crepeat measures analysis of variances\u201dand \u201cFriedman test\u201d, respectively. At T0 no dogs had PT and aPTT within reference range (6.8\u20108.6 seconds, and 10.2\u201012.3 seconds respectively) and mean aPPT and median PT was 45.9 and 120 seconds respectively; at T4, mean aPPT and median PT was 14.5 and 8.5 seconds, respectively; and at T8 (these data were available only in 43 out of the 73 dogs) mean aPPT and median PT was 13.7 and 8.3 seconds respectively. There was a significant decreased in aPTT and PT between T0 and T4 and between T4 and T8 (p < 0.0001 for all comparison). All 73 dogs survived to discharge, none received blood or plasma transfusion or had an adverse reaction after vitamin K IV supplementation, and by T4 no dogs showed clinical signs of ongoing of external bleeding.

It is highly resistant to major antimicrobials, dry environment and disinfectants. Acb infections are increasingly reported in dogs and cats. This report describes a severe nosocomial outbreak of a multidrug resistant (MDR) Acb isolate, inducing a systemic, highly fatal illness, in a veterinary hospital that had occurred in several clusters (08/2011 to 11/2012). The affected 19 dogs and 4 cats were all microbiologically positive for this isolate. Acb was isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common underlying primary diagnoses included seizures of various causes (4 animals), pneumonia, lung contusion, lymphoma, acute lung injury, feline idiopathic cystitis, heatstroke, urinary tract infection (UTI) and intervertebral disk herniation (2 each). The overall mortality rate was 70% (16/23 animals). Acb infection played a major part in the mortality of 5 animals, and contributed to the mortality in 10. The infection\u2010associated clinical and laboratory signs included fever, tracheal tube purulent discharge, hypotension, neutropenia, neutrophilia and neutrophilic cytoplasmic toxicity, which were absent previously during hospitalization. The Acb associated infections included pneumonia, UTI, cellulitis and sepsis. Most infected animals were hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), however, infections were identified in 5/23 animals in other wards, including one dog hospitalized in isolation. Mortality was unassociated with hospitalization length, urinary catheter placement, tracheal intubation or ventilation. Mortality rate tended to increase (P = 0.09) in respiratory Acb infections compared to other organs infection. The isolated Acb was resistant to numerous antibiotics, excluding amikacin, imipenem, ticarcillin and polymyxin\u2010B. During the outbreak, an environmental investigation was performed, and samples from cages, rails, phones, sinks and ventilator were obtained, and yielded pure Acb cultures. These isolates had identical MDR profiles as determined in the Acb isolated from the infected animals. An infection control protocol was implemented, including aggressive disinfection of surfaces and equipment, and staff education regarding personal hygiene and antisepsis, which subsequently, led to a sharp decrease in the incidence MDR Acb infections in the hospital. Outbreaks of MDR Acb infections may be highly fatal and difficult to irradiate, warranting education for antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use, especially in veterinary ICUs.",

Abdominal cryptococcosis is rare in cats, dogs and people, but more common in ferrets and horses. Databases from four referral centres and three veterinary laboratories were searched (2000\u20102012) for cryptococcosis primarily affecting intra\u2010abdominal structures. Signalment, clinical findings, antigen titres, culture, treatment and outcomes were reviewed. Twenty\u2010five cases (24 dogs, one cat) met the inclusion criteria. Median age and weight at diagnosis for the dogs was 2 years (range:8 months\u20108 years) and 20.9 kg (range:8\u201057 kg), respectively. Breeds included Staffordshire Bull Terriers (4), Bulldogs (3), seven other purebreds and 10 crossbreds, with 11 males (5 castrated) and 13 females (9 spayed). The cat was a 4\u2010year\u2010old male neutered Domestic Shorthair. The majority of cases were from Western Australia (20), four were from Queensland and one each from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Presenting complaints included inappetence (8), lethargy (13), vomiting (15), hematemesis (1), diarrhoea (5), melaena (3), dyschezia (1), weight loss (8) and a mass noted by the owner (3). Physical findings included fever (1), abdominal distension (2) or pain (5), abdominal mass (11) or effusion (1) and ataxia/back pain (2). Cryptococcal lesions involved the stomach (1), small (13) or large (1) bowel, ileocaecocolic junction (1), abdominal cavity/mesentery (18), kidney (1), liver (1) and pancreas (2). Eight cases had thoracic imaging, three with lesions. The antigen titres ranged from 1:2 to 1:65,536 (median 2048) in 11 dogs tested. Culture was attempted in eight patients, yielding C.gattii (4) and C.neoformans (3); one case failed to grow in vitro. Untreated cases were euthanased after diagnosis. Treatment was attempted in 14 patients, consisting of complete surgical excision (2), surgical excision or de\u2010bulking plus anti\u2010fungal therapy (5) and anti\u2010fungal therapy alone (7). Median survival for all treated patients was 805 days (range:2\u20102737). Survival of the two cases treated with surgery alone was 40 and 2737 days. Median survival for medically treated cases was 103 days (range:2\u20101460) and for combined therapy was 1029 days (range:132\u2010 1984). Abdominal cryptococcosis is a life\u2010threatening infection which is much more common in dogs than cats. Successful therapy requires aggressive management. We hypothesise that the scavenging nature of dogs predisposes to transient intestinal colonisation with mucosal injury permitting invasion into the gut wall, with subsequent spread to contiguous structures and/or dissemination via lymphatic or portal venous pathways.",

Definitive ante mortem discrimination between benign and malignant esophageal masses is difficult, requiring endoscopy and histopathology of esophageal biopsies, or post\u2010mortem microscopic examination of esophageal specimens. Serum acute phase proteins (APPs) concentrations in dogs change in response to inflammation and are utilized as diagnostic and prognostic markers in various canine diseases. This study aimed to characterize serum APPs concentrations in dogs with esophageal spirocercosis and to investigate their discriminatory performance between malignant and benign esophageal nodules. The study included 78 client\u2010owned dogs with esophageal spirocercosis, of which 23 re\u2010presented during therapy. Serum C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp), serum\u2010amyloid A (SAA) and albumin concentrations were measured at presentation and at follow\u2010up visits, and were compared with those of healthy dogs, and between malignant and benign esophageal spirocercosis cases. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to assess the diagnostic utility of APPs and the white blood cell count (WBC) in discriminating malignant from benign cases. Serum Hp, CRP and SAA concentrations at presentation and at follow\u2010up visits were significantly higher, and albumin concentration was significantly lower in infected dogs compared to their reference intervals (RIs) (P < 0.001 for all), but did not change significantly during anthelmintic therapy. Compared to benign cases, neoplastic cases had significantly higher levels of CRP (P = 0.011), Hp (P = 0.008) and SAA (P = 0.05), while albumin concentration was significantly lower (P = 0.012). However, serum concentrations of these APPs and the leukocyte count only moderately discriminated between suspected neoplastic and benign esophageal nodules (area under the ROC curve, 0.70, 0.69, 0.71, 0.68 and 0.74, respectively). Nevertheless, there were no neoplastic cases with concentrations of all four APPs within reference interval concurrently. In conclusion, canine esophageal spirocercosis is characterized by an acute phase reaction, at presentation and during anthelmintic therapy, but they are not useful to monitor response during treatment. When the concentrations of all four are within RI, esophageal malignancy can be ruled out. Although concentrations of all positive APPs were significantly higher in neoplastic compared to benign cases, moderate discriminatory power precludes their individual clinical use in spirocercosis",

Forty\u2010five dogs, 35 males and 10 females with a mean age of 83.3 + 38.2 (SD) months and a mean body weight of 26.5 kg + 5.8, were included in the study. According to instrumental findings at admission, the dogs were divided into two groups: normal dogs (10) and dogs with primary myocardial disorders (35), 14 of which with signs of congestion. Normal distribution of values was assessed by the Shapiro\u2010Wilk W\u2010test. Normally distributed data were tested using Student's t\u2010test and non\u2010normally distributed data using Wilcoxon's sum rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed with GLM and non\u2010parametric ANOVA to test the influence of each variable and of congestive cardiac failure on the results.

Blood was analysed for creatinine, ALAT, total T4 and glucose. Echocardiography with 12 MHz probe was used. Seven electrodes were placed on ventral thorax providing a 3 lead ECG. The cats were released to roam freely in the home environment during 24 hours.Fifteen privately owned HCM cats of 6 different breeds, age 1.4\u201011.2 years (mean 5.1), five females and ten males, were included. At initial visit, echocardiography, blood pressure and Holter was performed. IVSd and LWVd were 6\u20107.2 mean 6.5 mm. Mean Holter time was 23 hrs 11 min. Cats were treated with a tablet once daily for 30 days (atenolol 6.25 mg or placebo). At revisit blood pressure was measured and Holter again recorded (mean 23 hrs 32 min). Holter data were manually analysed by one of the authors (SH) using Welch Allyns PCH100 Holter analysis system.Three cats were excluded from the study due to CHF, not being able to medicate properly, or computer problems. Before treatment, mean heart rate was 158 bpm SD 24. The cats had normal sinus rhythms with tall R waves or left anterior fascicular block appearance and mild to moderate sinus arrhythmia. Median number of VECs was 3 IQR 1\u201029. Median number of SVECs was 0 IQR 0\u20100. Mean blood pressure 140 mmHg SD 13.7 cats received placebo and 5 cats received atenolol.

To perform a MC, an operator strikes a blow with the fist to a specific place on the thorax. The object of the study was to describe the efficacy of MC in interrupting SVTs and the electrocardiographic variations of SVTs sequence post\u2010MC. Twelve\u2010lead electrocardiograms of 74 dogs underwent electrophysiological study were retrospectively analyzed. Nineteen dogs of different breeds with a mean age (+ SD) 3.07 + 2.8 years, a mean body weight of 35.3 + 11.7 kg, a M:F of 0.6 were selected. In thirteen cases, MC was performed during orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (OAVRT) and in 6 cases during focal atrial tachycardia (FAT). Normal distribution of values was assessed by the Shapiro\u2010Wilk W\u2010test. Normally distributed data were tested using Student's t\u2010test and non\u2010normally distributed data using Wilcoxon's sum rank test. In 84% of the cases, MC interrupted SVT (92.3% of OAVRT and 66.6% of FAT) with no statistical difference between the two groups (p 0.15). In 100% of the cases the last deflection before the interruption of the SVT was a P' wave. The mean duration of the pause after the interruption was 930,06 \u00b1 500.91 msec (1146.9 + 383.86 msec OAVRT, 333.75 + 182.34 msec FAT) and significant longer in OAVRT. In 100% of cases, after the pause sinus rhythm (SR) was present and SVT re\u2010occurred in 5119.25 + 2962.28 msec (5000.83 + 3262.07 msec OAVRT, 5296.5 + 825.19 msec FAT). After MC, P'R intervals progressively prolonged in 100% of patients (OAVRT: pre\u2010MC 135.69 + 11.94; post\u2010MC 143.81 + 22.98 msec; FAT: pre\u2010MC 10.0 + 27.93; post\u2010MC 118.5 + 44.37 msec), suggesting a possible concealed conduction of the artificial potential along the AV node. RP' interval remained unchanged in 100% of the cases (OAVRT: pre\u2010MC 83.69 + 20.32, post MC 85.09 + 24.57 msec; FAT: pre\u2010MC 88.5 + 16.97, post\u2010MC 84.5 + 27.58 msec) suggesting no effect on the accessory pathway retrograde conduction or atrial ectopic focus discharge rate. No complications occurred. Based on these results, MC can be considered a successful and safe procedure for transient interruption of SVTs in dogs, it allows the comparison of P\u2010QRS\u2010T waves during SVT and during SR that can lead to the possible diagnosis of underlying electrogenic mechanism.",

Thoracic radiography is considered the clinical gold standard while several Doppler\u2010echocardiographic variables of left ventricular filling have been tested successfully. Recently, a novel echocardiographic index: the pulmonary vein to pulmonary artery diameter ratio (PV/PA) has been described1 and might be helpful to distinguish dogs in CHF from those in a compensatory state. The aim of this study was to investigate if PV/PA could predict CHF in dogs with MMVD. For this prospective study, 35 dogs were recruited, including 6 healthy dogs and 29 dogs with MMVD including ISACHC stage 1 (15), stage 2 (7) and stage 3 (7), based on physical examination echocardiography\u2010Doppler (in all dogs) and thoracic radiographs (in 22 dogs). Radiographs were assessed for signs of CHF, using a composite score based on cardiomegaly signs, venous congestion and lung pattern, by two readers blinded regarding echocardiographic results. PV/PA was measured in bi\u2010dimensional (BD) and M\u2010mode (MM) at the end of the T wave by two investigators blinded to radiographs results. Inter\u2010observer variability for PV/PA was identical in BD and MM (coefficient of variation of 9% in each). PV/PA BD was highly correlated to PV/PA MM (r = 0.815, P < 0.001). PV/PA in MM was lower in healthy dogs (1.04 \u00b1 0.1) compared to dogs with MMVD stage 1 (1.57 \u00b1 0.08, P < 0.05) and gradually increased with ISACHC stages (2.06 \u00b1 0.2 in stage 2, 2.90 \u00b1 0.3 in stage 3, P < 0.05). In BD, PV/PA in healthy and MMVD stage 1 dogs differed from MMVD stages 2 and 3 (P < 0.01). PV/PA in BD and MM were correlated to other echocardiographic left ventricular filling indices such as the indexed left atrial (LA/Ao) and left ventricular sizes (LVIDd/Ao, EDVI) (P < 0.001) and to E/A ratio (P < 0.001). PV/PA ratio was increased in dogs with a composite radiographic score \u22652 compared to dogs with a score < 2. Areas under the receiver\u2010operating characteristic curve showed that a cut\u2010off value of 1.75 for the PV/PA ratio in MM and BD predicted CHF in dogs with MMVD with a sensitivity of 100% and 89% and a specificity of 83% and 92%, respectively. PV/PA ratio is a simple, reproducible, sensitive and specific echocardiographic index and contributes to assess CHF status in dogs with MMVD.",

The major obstacle of these studies is the limited availability of heart tissue samples. Previous studies showed that lymphocytes in peripheral blood can reflect the expression profiles of several organs including the heart in humans. This is due to interaction of blood cells with every tissue and its microenvironment in the body. Blood based expression profiles may offer a powerful tool for screening molecular events in the heart during the disease courses.",

Heart tissue and blood samples were collected for RNA isolation from animals that were used in other purpose approved human medical research projects. Tachypacing induced cardiomyopathy dogs with severely decreased contractility (n = 6) were compared to healthy controls (n = 4) in pooled samples with equal gender ratio. Whole blood was obtained in special sampling tubes suitable for immediate total RNA stabilization and storage. Cardiac left ventricular free wall (transmural) tissue samples were collected into RNAlater solution after euthanasia. Isolated total RNA quantity and quality was controlled by spectrophotometry and capillary electrophoresis and proved proper for gene expression profiling. Gene expression levels were measured by dual color microarray method (oligonucleotide microarray 4x44K format covering the total canine transcriptome). Results showed 1150 differently expressed transcripts (fold change \u2265 2; Student's t\u2010test with Benjamini\u2010Hochberg multiple test correction, p \u2264 0,05; two technical repeats) between heart failure and control groups in heart samples. From these transcripts 123 (10,7%) could be identified similarly also in the blood samples. This subgroup consist of numerous mRNA transcripts related to extracellular matrix proteins, inflammatory and stress response, connective tissue turnover, apoptosis and contractility (e.g. versican, osteopontin, heat shock protein\u201090, S100\u2010protein, CD163, IL\u20108, IL\u201017, alpha\u20102 collagen type\u2010I, matrix metalloproteinase\u20101, mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase, chemokine ligand 2, fibroblast growth factor, myosin heavy chain\u20107). Pathway analysis resulted fibrosis as the main significant process. This finding is in line with major characteristic of the tachypacing induced model described in the literature (decreased contractility, fibrosis, remodeling). Our results suggest that blood may reflect heart\u2010specific gene expression changes in dogs with heart failure.",

It is unknown if a malabsorption of cobalamin or other micronutrients (e.g., folate) due to chronic gastrointestinal disease plays a role in the cause for this finding in Greyhounds. Cobalamin and folate are absorbed in the distal and proximal small intestine, respectively. In humans, low serum cobalamin and folate concentrations have been associated with an increase in serum homocysteine (HCY) concentration, which reflects a lack of the intracellular availability of both vitamins. Increased serum HCY concentrations are associated with cardiovascular and thrombotic diseases in humans, and these conditions have also been described in Greyhounds. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate 1) the frequency of hypofolatemia in hypocobalaminemic Greyhounds, and 2) serum HCY concentrations in hypocobalaminemic and hypofolatemic Greyhounds.",

Recently, a new treatment option consisting of an iodine\u2010restricted food was introduced in the management of feline hyperthyroidism. Previous studies showed that the food is a safe and effective method for decreasing circulating total thyroxine (TT4) concentration and managing hyperthyroidism in a research colony of cats1.

The aim of the present study was to determine the prognostic value of different clinical and clinicopathological variables evaluated at the time of diagnosis, before treatment, in dogs with PDH. Medical records from one referral center were retrospectively evaluated. The diagnosis of hypercortisolism was confirmed using the LDDS test and/or ACTH stimulation test in dogs with compatible clinical signs. The differentiation between adrenal dependent hypercortisolism and PDH was based on the ultrasonographic appearance of the adrenal glands, the results of the LDDS test and concentrations of endogenous ACTH. Only newly diagnosed dogs with PDH, subsequently treated with trilostane, were included. The following variables were entered into a univariate Cox Regression analysis to determine if they were associated with survival: age, sex, neutered status, clinical signs, concomitant diseases, hypertensive status, serum cortisol concentrations, routine biochemical and haematological parameters, urine specific gravity, urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC), and urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UAC). Those that showed possible association (p < 0.2) with survival were than included in a stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Eighty\u2010two dogs were eligible for inclusion in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 10.1 years (range: 4.3\u201016.9). There were 36 male (5 castrated) and 46 female (19 spayed). Median survival time was 461 days (range: 8\u20103256). Variables related to survival were age, urea, potassium, phosphate, lymphocytes and basal serum cortisol concentrations. In the multivariable model survival was associated with serum potassium (OR: 2.08, CI95%: 1.24\u20103.49, p = 0.006) and phosphate (OR: 1.31, CI95%: 1.03\u20101.68, p = 0.029) concentrations. Hyperphosphatemia was observed in 30 cases (36.6%, median phosphate 5.5 mg/dl, range: 4.9\u20107.5) and hyperkalemia in 6 dogs (7.3%, median potassium 5.8 mEq/L, range: 5.6\u20106.2). Phosphate concentrations were positively correlated with post\u2010ACTH cortisol concentrations (r = 0.33, p = 0.006), alanine aminotransferase (r = 0.37, p = 0.002) and gamma glutamyl transferase activities (r = 0.38, p = 0.001) and negatively correlated with total calcium concentrations (r = \u20100.40, p < 0.001) and urinary specific gravity (r = \u20100.35, p = 0.005). Potassium concentrations were positively correlated only with serum alkaline phosphatase activity (r = 0.29, p = 0.017). We conclude that serum phosphate and potassium concentrations appear to be of prognostic importance in dogs with PDH. UPC appears unrelated to survival in canine PDH, unalike in dogs with chronic kidney disease, despite the marked proteinuria associated with this disease.",

Commercially available assays, using recombinant human 21\u2010hydroxylase (21\u2010OH) as the antigen, are used as screening tools for the identification of anti\u2010adrenal autoantibodies (ABs) in serum. Presence of these ABs constitutes the primary criteria for an early diagnosis of adrenalitis. In dogs, such a test is not commercially available. Using recombinant canine 21\u2010OH as the antigen in Western Blot (WB) and enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we previously were able to show that approximately 30% of dogs with naturally occurring primary HoAC had measurable ABs against 21\u2010OH. A limitation of this study was small sample size. Further, the differences in optical densities (OD) in the ELISA between specific binding to 21\u2010OH and nonspecific binding (NSB) were narrow. The aim of the present study was to decrease the NSB OD, without decreasing the specific OD, with the overarching goal to improve the performance of the 21\u2010OH AB ELISA. To achieve this, sera from one dog that was immunized with canine 21\u2010OH were used as negative (pre\u2010immunization) and positive (post\u2010immunization) controls. Using these, combinations of four different amounts of canine 21\u2010OH for plate coating, 12 different blocking buffers, and eight different assay buffers were compared. Once the best combination was established, a total of 59 serum samples from dogs with HoAC, 20 serum samples from healthy dogs, and from dogs with hyperadrenocorticism receiving treatment with mitotane (n = 31) and trilostane (n = 24), were analysed.Coating ELISA plates using 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, containing 2.5 \u03bcg/mL recombinant purified canine 21\u2010OH, gave an adequate OD, and increasing its concentration did not increase the OD. Using a commercial non\u2010mammalian protein blocking buffer significantly decreased NSB OD, without decreasing the specific OD. This positive effect was enhanced with the use of a particular proprietary assay buffer. Considering ODs above the calculated upper limit (MEAN+2SD) for healthy dogs as positive, 13 of the 59 dogs with HoAC were classified as true positives, and one healthy dog was classified as false\u2010positive, showing that the ELISA had a high specificity (95%), but a low sensitivity (22%). Including dogs with hyperadrenocorticism in these calculations, numbers changed slightly (92 and 22%, respectively). These data suggest that the ELISA, in its current form, provides a high level of confidence in positive results. We therefore strongly believe that this assay has potential for assisting in the early diagnosis of adrenalitis in dogs.",
