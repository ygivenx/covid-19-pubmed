The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Virginia. Families at two study sites (Pittsburgh, Charlottesville) with two children between the ages of 1 and 5 years were recruited for participation by advertisement. Exclusion criteria included the presence in either child of a serious medical condition, a medical condition that predisposes to persistent OM, a non-intact or structurally abnormal tympanic membrane, a pre-existing sensorineural hearing loss, or an inability to cooperate sufficiently with the examination and test procedures. After affirmation of willingness to participate and acquisition of written informed consent, families were entered into the study in October with an anticipated follow-up through April of that year and were reimbursed for participation. The study subjects included the two index children and any older sibs less than 10 years of age who provided assent. The study data consist of demographic information, genotypes for selected cytokine polymorphisms, weekly assignments of the presence/absence of OM and detections of upper respiratory virus in the nasopharynx by PCR assay of nasal secretions. The hypothesis tested is that the selected cytokine polymorphisms affect the coincidence of new OM episodes during new detections of upper respiratory virus.",

A positive diagnosis for OM was made when middle ear effusion (with or without air/fluid level) was observed irrespective of the presence or absence of concurrent signs of ME infection. AOM was diagnosed by the presence of OM with concurrent signs of ME infection including parental report of ear pulling, otalgia, irritability and fussiness and otoscopic signs of erythema and/or white opacification (other than from scarring) of the tympanic membrane, bulging or fullness of the tympanic membrane, or otorrhea from a perforation of a previously intact tympanic membrane.

For each virus, the OM coincidence rate of a first virus detection was calculated as the sum over all subjects of associated new OM detections for that virus divided by the number of individuals with virus detection. Coincidence was defined as virus detection within 5 days before and 10 days after the day of onset of a new OM episode. This interval was chosen to correspond to the usual time for sampling nasal secretions during new CLI and/or OM episodes.",

The assayed polymorphisms, TNF\u03b1 (\u2212308), IL-10 (\u22121082, \u2212819, \u2212592), IL-6 (\u2212174) and IFN-\u03b3 (+874), were chosen to represent those included in the earlier report [16]. The analyses focused on the OM coincidence of RV and RSV detections because of the small number of detections for other assayed viruses which severely limited the power of statistical testing. For both RV and RSV detections, a logistic regression model that included age, race, sex and the cytokine phenotypes identified the high production IL-10 phenotype as a significant predictor of new OM episodes. The large number of RV detections allowed for a more complex logistic regression model that included selected OM risk factors. As expected from previous reports [23], younger age, a positive history of OM and a daily environment outside of the home were significant predictors of OM coincidence. Unexpectedly, a positive history of breastfeeding also predicted OM coincidence which is directionally opposed to most previous reports. However, it should be noted that the majority of children in this study were breastfed and, consequently, the effect of breastfeeding may have resulted from random distributional linkage of breastfeeding with other, unmeasured, risk factors. None-the-less, that analysis identified the high production IL-10 and TNF\u03b1 phenotypes and the low production IL-6 phenotype as significant predictors of OM coincidence.",

One possibility is that this reflects the difference in the ages of the study populations (young infants vs. children). Specifically, past studies show a role for IFN\u03b3 in suppressing RSV infection [24] and document a shift during early infancy from a TH2 (low IFN\u03b3) biased to a TH1 (high IFN\u03b3) biased immune response [25, 26]. There, the higher production IFN\u03b3 phenotype in young infants with a TH2 bias may allow for sufficient IFN\u03b3 to decrease RSV complications, but be inconsequential in older children with a TH1 bias where sufficient IFN\u03b3 is constitutively produced.",

The general format of these cross-sectional studies was to identify a group of children characterized by rAOM and a control group and then to compare the distributions of the cytokine genotypes between the two. For example, Joki-Erkkila et al. compared the distribution of TNF\u03b1 (\u2212308), IL-1\u03b1 (\u2212899), IL-1\u03b2 (\u2212511) and IL-1ra polymorphisms between 63 persons in 20 families with a high occurrence of rAOM and 400 unselected blood donors of unknown OM history [12]. While they reported no significant difference in the distribution of any of the genotypes, the study design was suboptimal given the lack of an age matched control group with no OM history and the power to detect true differences was low given the small sample size of the affected population.",

These results compare favorably with those of the present study when recognizing that Patel et al. assigned the high production IL-6 phenotype to the less common C/C genotype, while we, like others assign the low production phenotype to that genotype [16, 17, 19, 20]. Thus, like OM coincidence during RV detection, membership in the otitis-prone group was predicted by the low production IL-6 and the high production TNF\u03b1 phenotypes (using our phenotype assignments).",

Of the children, 122 had 2\u20133 AOM episodes and 226 had \u22654 AOM episodes (defined for purposes of the study as otitis-prone). They assayed for TNF\u03b1 (\u2212238, \u2212308, \u2212376, \u2212857, \u2212863), IL-1\u03b2 (\u221231), IL-4 (\u2212524), IL-6 (\u2212174), IL-8 (781) and IL-10 (\u2212819, \u22121082) polymorphisms (as well as polymorphisms in other signaling molecules) and compared all genotype distributions between affected children and adult controls, and between the two groups of children. Contrary to Patel et al. (and our data), they reported a significant overrepresentation of the IL-6 (\u2212174) G/G genotype in the rAOM children compared to control adults (but no difference between groups of affected children) and of the TNF (\u2212238) G/G genotype and the (\u2212376) G/G genotype but not the (\u2212308) A/A genotype in otitis-prone children when compared with those who had 2\u20133 AOM episodes (but no differences between the rAOM group and the adult controls). The results of this study are difficult to interpret for a number of reasons including the suboptimal design that lacked matched-controls of known OM history, the fact that the associated P values were very close to 0.05 and were not corrected for the numerous comparisons done on the data set (adjustment for multiple comparisons would have eliminated the significance of all findings) and the internally inconsistent results where differences between groups of affected children were not generalizable to comparisons between all affected children and controls.",

A variety of study designs are applicable to testing these hypotheses including those that attempt to identify discriminators of the otitis-prone condition [12\u201314] and/or of children with chronic OME, and those that, like the present study, focus on possible mechanisms (relating cytokine polymorphisms to a pathway of disease pathogenesis) [14, 16, 27]. However, there are a large number of cytokine polymorphisms (as well as polymorphisms in other signaling molecules [14, 28\u201330]), and there are no clear rules for the judicious choice of which of these polymorphisms should be included in any given study. Moreover, the complexity of the signaling pathways involved in host inflammatory responses with feedback amplification and inhibition suggests that cytokine haplotypes be included as predictors, though this is hardly practical given the very large number of possible haplotypes. Guidance in these issues is expected when the data from more detailed genetic linkage studies of OM risk available, but it should be noted that none of the cytokine genes lie in the chromosomal regions identified as containing suspected genes affecting a child\u2019s experience with tympanostomy tube insertion [11]. None-the-less, with these caveats and adequate justification for the choice of assayed polymorphisms, continued study along the lines advanced above is likely to yield important information regarding the genetic basis for OM susceptibility.",
