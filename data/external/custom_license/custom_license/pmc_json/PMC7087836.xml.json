            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a significant viral disease of poultry worldwide and caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). This disease has caused high economic losses in the Iranian poultry industry (Shoushtari et al. 2008; Vasfi-Marandi and Bozorgmehrifard 2001). IBV belongs to group III of the genus Coronavirus of Coronaviridae family. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of IBV is closely associated with the genomic RNA, and has highly conserved amino acid and nucleotide sequences. The spike glycoprotein (S) is anchored in the viral envelope and is post-translationally cleaved into two proteins designated S1 and S2. In contrast to the N protein, the S protein is very diverse in terms of both nucleotide sequence and deduced primary protein structure (Kant et al. 1992). The presence of IBV is commonly determined by the inoculation of suspected tissue samples material into embryonated chicken eggs for observation the specific lesions of embryos by the IBVs, followed by serological methods in chickens. IBV also may be detected directly in tissue of infected birds by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques (Cavanagh and Naqi 2003; De Wit 2000; Swayne et al. 1998). The immunoperoxidase (IP) assay has been successfully used to determine the presence of antigen in tissue sections in most diagnostic laboratories. The IP assay can be performed by direct (DIP) and indirect (IIP) methods. The IIP assay is more sensitive than DIP, but depends on the type selection of reagents. The IIP assay is a reliable and rapid diagnostic assay (Dabbas 2002; Chauhan 1995; Hayat 2002; Levinson and Jawetz 1998). Complexes of antigen and antibody are observable by using enzyme substrate which makes a colorful reaction. The slides prepared according to the IP assay, such as histology and pathology slides, are storable for long time, thus, it is possible to carry out IP assay for retrospective analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The main problem of this technique is the existence of endogenous peroxidase in cells such as white blood cells that can show false-positive results. To solve this problem, the activity of endogen peroxidase should be neutralized before using initial antibody.",

After being rehydrated by ethanol, the slides were rinsed first in deionized water and then placed in Tris buffer solution (TBS = 50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH = 7.6) for 5 min. Antigen retrial was performed by incubating the sections for 20 min with EDTA solution (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH = 9). After 20 min, the slides were left at room temperature (RT) and then rinsed with TBS. The tissues were encompassed using a special immunohistochemistry pen. Then, the solutions that block the endogenous peroxidase and biotin activity were added separately on the tissue sections and they were rinsed with TBS after 5 min. A volume of 200 \u03bcl of 1/400 dilution of group-specific anti-IBV monoclonal antibody (anti-M and anti-S) (Naqi 1990) was added on tissue sections and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. Then the slides were rinsed three times in TBS for 5 min. A volume about 200 \u03bcl of anti-mouse biotin prepared in goat was added on the slides and incubated at RT for 45 min. After rinsing with TBS as above, the peroxidase conjugated connected to streptavidin was added on the tissue sections and incubated at RT for 15 min. To demonstrate the reaction between antibody and antigen, DAB substrate solution antibody (DakoCytomation Co., Glostrup, Denmark) was used. The slides were removed from the rinsing solution and were dried rapidly. Then, substrate solution was applied on the tissue sections and the sections were placed in RT. After being dehydrated by ethanol, the slides were rinsed first in deionized water then covered with background staining solution (methyl green or hematoxylin). The extra stains were removed by adding ethyl alcohol; finally, the slides were mounted by permanent mounting media (DakoCytomation Co., Glostrup, Denmark). The intensity of reaction of the specific monoclonal antibody against IBV in tissue sections was carried out according to Cruz-Coy et al. (1993). Scoring of reaction was detected by optical microscope in magnification 40 as follows: (0) = no cell is positive, (+1) = less than one positive cell, (+2) = between 1 and 5 positive cells and (+3) = more than 5 positive cells. Furthermore, different dilutions of antigens were analyzed and the 1:300 dilution was taken into account for primary antibody in IIP assay.",

The presence of IBV was confirmed in 12 cases, while in 26 samples, it was not confirmed. The presence of virus in days 2, 3, 4, and 5 PI was confirmed in trachea and lung. Furthermore, presence of virus in day 5 in kidney and days 3, 4, and 5 in cecal tonsil were confirmed. However, the existence of IBV in the control tissue samples on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 PI was not confirmed by RT-PCR. The results of RT-PCR and IIP assays in trachea, lung, kidney, and cecal tonsil are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n\n",
