In another factory where 75% of the\nworkforce was infected, only one death occurred, and few serious cases were\nobserved. While these observations should raise significant questions about\nchemical hygiene and fugitive emissions at the plants, this was a time when\nscientists often carried out experiments on themselves or people they knew and\nsome level of exposure to chemicals was tolerated.5,6",
