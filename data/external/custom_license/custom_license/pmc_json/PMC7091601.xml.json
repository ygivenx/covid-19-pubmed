The text is written in a clear and concise style augmented by over 300 colour illustrations, photographs and tables. A 17 page glossary of scientific and clinical terms is a particularly useful feature as are the summary lists of key facts at the end of each chapter.",

The text has been updated since the previous edition in order to keep up with the recent developments in microbiology of which the dentist should be aware. New chapters have been written on fungi, human herpes viruses, infections of the central nervous system and the use of antimicrobial agents in dentistry. The emergence of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and prion diseases are also covered and accordingly the chapters on sterilisation, disinfection and infection control procedures in dentistry have been completely rewritten to reflect changes in decontamination protocols.",
