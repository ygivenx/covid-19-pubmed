The capability to perform such a feat would allow for whole-genome sequencing for purposes of identification of organisms in the case of microbes, viruses or other pathogens, and mutation or identity analysis in the case of humans. Arguably, this could obviate the need for any other mode of nucleic acid analysis. Upon completion of the human genome sequence in 2003, the National Human Genome Research Institute (MD, USA) challenged the scientific community to develop technology that would allow sequencing of a human genome for US$1000. Using current state-of-the-art capil-lary-based DNA sequence analysis, it still costs well over US$10 million to sequence the 3 billion base pairs comprising the human genome. However, a number of investigators, including those at Microchip Biotechnologies, Agencourt Bioscience, 454 Life Sciences, LI-COR and Caltech, are among the awardees developing near-term methods to sequence a human-sized genome for US$100,000 [101].",

            "text": "In operation, a voltage is applied across a membrane that is embedded with pores several nanometers in diameter. The voltage across the membrane drives nucleic acids through the membrane. The only locations through which the nucleic acids can traverse the membrane are at the pores. At each pore, a current is generated that is disrupted as DNA or RNA molecules traverse the pore. The characteristics of the time and magnitude of disruption of the crosspore current are dependent on the base composition and length of the DNA or RNA molecule. This is analogous to the Coulter counter that is used in routine hematology analysis of peripheral blood cells [7]. The nanometer-sized pores control the processing of nucleic acid strands as size limits the passage to one DNA or RNA specie at a time. Initial studies with 2.6-nm hemolysin pores showed that single-stranded (ss)DNA but not double-stranded (ds)DNA traversed the pore [8]. The cross-sectional size of a dsDNA molecule is approximately 2 nm, and passage of a dsDNA has been demonstrated using an ion beam-fabricated 3 nm diameter silicon nitride nanopore [9]. In contrast, ssDNA but not dsDNA translocated through a 0.5 nm, ion beam-f-abricated pore [10]. There is an increasing diversity of sizes of nano-pores that are being created and used to process a greater distribution of sizes of DNA [5]. Another type of nanomanipulation uses a nanochannel to stretch genomic DNA and simplify the sequencing\n. This potential to manipulate genomic DNA directly is at an early stage of development, but is an indication that single-molecule nucleic acid detection and manipulation is a realistic target [11].",

An additional advantage of nanopore-based sequencing is the capacity for miniaturization. Miniaturization is particularly interesting because not only does a nanoscale pore lend itself to submicron sizing, but utilizing electrical detection will also provide independence from the size constraints of optical detectors.",

The lack of adoption may be due to the significant implementation barrier a replacement technology encounters as it attempts to displace established technologies for which equipment and protocols are tried and tested. Nevertheless, nanoparticle labels have a number of intriguing properties that facilitate multiplexing and direct visual detection that may ultimately propel these labels to the forefront of testing.

The introduction of new scanning methods and the re-emergence of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) have provided considerable impetus to this rapidly evolving field of nanoparticle labels.",

Metal nanoparticles have distinct advantages over fluorescent dyes as labels. They have narrow Raman emission peaks, and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is directly related to nanoparticle size, which makes for simple multiplexing strategies based on size [16]. The SPR of an object depends on small changes in the refractive index that occur near or at the surface of a metal such as gold, silver or copper [17]. Metal nanoparticles are stabilized by surface ligands (such as citrate) in order to maintain solubility, and the variation in the size of the nanoparticles creates the variation in SPR (thus a 40-nm gold nanoparticle gives off a different SPR than a 15-nm gold nanoparticle, even though they are both made of the same metal).",

One detection method employs a fiber optic illuminator known as a Darklite Illuminator; in this detection scheme, the array slides are mounted on a microscope stage and illuminated in the plane of the slide by a fiber optic illuminator [16]. Another method uses a flatbed scanner to detect gold nanoparticles after silver enhancement [19]. The build-up of the silver coating on the gold nanoparticles is also visible to the naked eye, thus allowing for quick signal detection on an array. A commercial scanner, the Verigene ID\u2122 (Nanosphere, Inc. [102]), measures scattered light from silver-enhanced gold nanoparticles and acquires visual records of the experimental data [19]. Another scanner, the NIS 2000 image analyzer, measures the Rayleigh scatter signal of silver-enhanced gold nanoparticles; this scanner can detect up to approximately 0.001 gold probes/\u00b5m2\n[20].",

Raman spectro-scopy relies on detecting a signal that is only 0.0001% of the light that is scattered from the sample, thus the combination of a low signal intensity and fluorescence background could be problematic [21]. SERS solves the problem of autofluorescence and background fluorescence through metal adsorption of the sample with metals such as silver and gold. The resonant excitation of surface plasmons on the metal surface results in a Raman signal enhancement of 102\u2013104 compared with the Raman signal generated from the sample alone [22]. The importance of SERS is evident from its diverse applications in genomic and proteomic assays [23,24]. Another important aspect of SERS is its application in a DNA\u2013gold nanoparticle-based method of detecting unamplified genomic DNA sequences by measuring scattered light [25], as opposed to the flatbed scanner method that measures reflected light [20]. This unamplified DNA assay relied on monitoring the plasmon shift that occurs when 40\u201350-nm diameter gold nanoparticles aggregate; the process allows for the detection of aggregates in the presence of a large amount of nonaggregated material and a detection limit of just 333 zmol of target was achieved [25].",

            "text": "Nanoparticles have also been exploited in more complex analytical strategies, such as the bio-barcode amplification (BCA) technique. This approach uses gold nanoparticles derivatized with single-stranded oligonucleotide barcodes and an oligo-nucleotide complementary to a portion of the target sequence under interrogation, as well as magnetic microparticles that are modified with multiple copies of an oligonucleo-tide complementary to a second portion of the same target sequence under interrogation. Oligonucleotide complementary to the single-stranded, bound bio-barcodes are hybridized to the gold nanoparticle. The target under interrogation is hybridized to both the nanoparticle and magnetic microparticles. If complementation occurs to both single-stranded, bound oligo-nucleotide on the nanoparticles as well as the second oligo-nucleotide from a different region of a target bound to the magnetic microparticle, then the two particles become bridged by hybridization to two different regions in the target DNA. This complex is then trapped on a magnetic column, washed and the single-stranded hybridized nanoparticle barcode is released by heat denaturation and annealed to an array containing one register that is complementary to the released bio-barcode strand. Since there are many bio-barcodes on each gold nanoparticle, hybridization of one target molecule results in release of many bio-barcodes per nanoparticle, which greatly amplifies the detection signal. The released bio-barcode contains a region complementary to one of the array-capture barcodes as well as sequence complementary to an oligonucleotide-bound, gold nanoparticle probe. The bio-barcode is captured on the array and hybridized to the universal oligonucleotide-bound nanoparticle. Detection is facilitated by silver enhancement of the bound gold nanoparticle and scanning with a flatbed scanner. The BCA technique allows for the detection of 500 zmol of target DNA, which translates to approximately ten copies in a 30-\u00b5l reaction mixture [26].",

Target oligonucleotides were electrostatically adsorbed onto a conducting polypyrrole surface at a glassy carbon electrode. These were then hybridized to the oligonucleotide-coated nanoparticles. The hybridization was monitored by the release of the copper metal atoms and detection of the copper by anodic stripping voltammetry (detection limit 5.0 pmol/l) [27]. In the form of microrods, other metals such as indium can also be used as labels for DNA hybridization assays (detection limit 250 zmol). This metal is not normally present in biologic sample-s, and it can be quantitated by solid-state derivative-chronopotentiometric measurements at a thick-film electrode transducer. An extension of this technique could be to multiplex assays using an electrical coding and identification system based on different metal labels [28]. Silver nanoparticles can also be used as oligonucleotide labels in DNA hybridization assays and detected using an electrochemical assay [29]. Following hybridization of the target DNA with the silver nanoparticle-labeled oligonucleotide probe, silver ions are released from the nanoparticle labels by oxidative metal dissolution, and the silver ions measured by anodic stripping voltammetry at a carbon fiber ultramicroelectrode. A large number of silver ions are released from each DNA hybrid and this allows detection of 0.5 pmol/l of target oligonucleotide.",

            "text": "The scope of application of integrated microchip devices that has already been documented provides ample evidence of their utility as analyzers suitable for nucleic acid analysis. However, commercialization of these devices is proceeding slowly. A notable exception is the Cepheid GeneXpert\u00ae module for DNA detection [107]. This automated real-time device provides fully integrated cartridge-based sample preparation with PCR amplification in a microchamber and detection, and delivers results from unprocessed sample in less than 30 min. A version of this module that identifies the presence of anthrax from air samples had been installed in US Postal Services sorting centers nationwide. This, together with the success of the microchip CE analyzers, should provide the necessary impetus for investment in the commercialization of more types of microchip analyzers in the future.",

Microtechnology has many beneficial attributes that recommend it for use in the clinical laboratory. Integration of the individual steps in multistep genetic tests into a single easy-to-use microchip device is one of the most appealing advantages. However, microtechnology is complex and requires sophisticated manufacturing techniques, and the same is true for nanotechnology. Thus, the clinical laboratory must rely on the medical diagnostics industry to commercialize microchip-based assays and analyzers. Until now, most microchip companies have focused on the needs of the pharmaceutical industry in massively parallel assays for drug discovery. There are now signs that finally, the potential of microtechnology in medical diagnostics is being seriously evaluated, and the first steps are being taken in the development of diagnostic microchip-based products.",

By 2010, there should be a firm conclusion on the viability of nucleic acid assays based on microchip technology. Most, if not all, of the proof-of-principle microchip experiments have been completed, and the FDA approval of the AmpliChip Cytochrome P450 Genotyping Test, provides a basis for optimism for further expansion of microarray-based genetic tests. Some other factors also must be considered. The current range of routine genetic tests is limited and just a fraction of what might eventually be possible or needed as the genome yields its secrets. However, the full implementation of a wider range of genetic testing services will require appropriate coverage of such testing and reimbursement to a level appropriate for the cost of performing this testing in a clinical laboratory. Generally, reimbursement and the American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes have not kept up with genetic testing, and much of the billing is based instead on the generic molecular diagnostic codes, 83890\u201383912, from the Pathology and Laboratory Chemistry subsection of the CPT [95,96].",
