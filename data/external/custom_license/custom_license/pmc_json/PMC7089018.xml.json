(great burnet) from the family Rosaceae is a well-known perennial plant indigenous to central and southern Europe and northern Africa, but also naturalized in North America and Asia [1, 2]. The medicinal herbs represent both aerial parts and roots. The roots of S. officinalis contain 12 \u2013 17% tannins (mainly hydrolysable ellagitannins and gallotanins) [3], e.g., sanguisorbic acid dilactone (a trimeric gallic acid structure), and ellagitannins sanguiins H-1, H-2, and H-3 [4], galloylhamameloses I and II [5, 6], and proanthocyanidins (7-O-galloyl-(+)catechin and 3-O-galloylprocyanidin-B-3) [3, 7]. Triterpene glycosides, derivatives of the ursolic and oleanolic acids (e.g. ziyu-glycoside I and II), flavonoids, phenolic acids, disaccharide, and neolignans are also present in the roots of great burnet [1, 8\u201311].",

Topically, it has been also applied to heal wounds, burns, and ulcers, and to treat bleeding, e.g., nosebleeds [2].",

            "text": "Previous studies confirmed that ethanol and aqueous extracts of the aerial parts and roots of S. officinalis possess numerous pharmacological activities. The ethanol extract in in vitro studies exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and can therefore be effective against bronchial asthma associated with allergic diseases [13]. The aqueous extract and disaccharides isolated from S. officinalis roots inhibited immediate- type allergic reactions [9, 14]. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of S. officinalis roots was related to blocking the production of NO and PGE2 on transcriptional levels [12]. The methanol extract of great burnet showed a protective effect against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity in rats [15]. An immunomodulatory effect of the polysaccharide fraction of S. officinalis extract was also demonstrated [10, 16]. Triterpene glycosides displayed antioxidant properties, including suppression of lipid peroxide and hydroxyl radical generation and upregulation of the superoxide dismutase activity [17]. Terpene glycosides exhibited hemostatic activity, the strongest one being shown by ziyu-glycoside I [18]. The aqueous extract of S. officinalis showed neuroprotective effects on the transient focal ischemia in rats, and the methanol extract also exhibited neuroprotective effect on the oxidative stress induced by amyloid beta protein [19\u201321]. The S. officinalis extracts demonstrated a great antithrombin effect and exhibited inhibitory activity against murine leukemia cells [13, 22]. Gallocatechin isolated from the roots showed a significant impact on tacrine induced cytotoxicity in Hep G2 cells [23]. Some of the triterpene glycosides from the roots were found to be cytotoxic against human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2) cells and human stomach tumor cells [8]. The ziyu-glucoside II showed an anticancer effect on the human gastric carcinoma BGC-823 cells [24], and an antiproliferative effect on human breast tumor cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 [25]. The methanol extract of S. officinalis inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cell PC 3 and induced apoptotic cell death by downregulation of McI-1 protein expression and Bax oligomerization [18]. The aqueous extract of S. officinalis turned out to be effective in in vitro inhibition of the hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase activity and suppressed the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) [26, 27]. The methanol extract of S. officinalis radix reduced coronavirus (CoV) replication [28]. The ethanol extract from the aerial part and rhizome of S. officinalis showed antibacterial activity [29]. The S. officinalis extract inhibited endothelin- 1 production in human keratinocytes, which plays an important role in UV-B induced pigmentation and fibroblastderived elastase, hence influencing the formation of wrinkles induced by UV-B [30, 31]. Ziyu-glycoside I was shown to be responsible for this activity [32]. Currently, both roots and aerial parts of great burnet are used in cosmetology. The S. officinalis root extract is classified as cleansing, refreshing, skin conditioning and tonic agent [33].",
