            "text": "In this paper we consider spread and containment of contagious diseases. Although the description pertains to humans, the models can be suitably extended to other living beings as well. We state the problem in an abstract manner and do not concentrate on any specific disease, however we restrict our study to two-phase contagious diseases. These diseases are such that when a person contracts the disease, he or she does not show any symptoms in the initial phase but can spread the disease. This initial phase is called the latent stage. In the latter phase of the disease, symptoms may appear and the individual may need to be treated, typically using expensive treatments. The latter phase is usually referred to as the symptomatic stage. If an individual is healthy, shots (usually vaccines) can be administered so that he or she does not contract the contagious disease at least for a period of time. If an individual is in the initial phase of the disease, he or she can be treated inexpensively (as opposed to when the symptoms appear) and can be cautious about not spreading the disease. Notice that individuals that are healthy cannot be distinguished from those that are in the initial stages of the disease, unless tested. The spread of such contagious diseases can be contained by testing individuals, giving shots to healthy individuals and treatment to individuals known to have the disease. The objective of this paper is to devise an algorithm to optimally allocate financial resources for testing, vaccination, and treatment by evaluating their trade-offs across a finite planning horizon.",

            "text": "The main goal of this paper is to present an analytic framework that can be used for a wide range of two-phase contagious diseases. However, for the sake of clarity in exposition, we present a few examples. In particular, AIDS and cervical cancer can be modeled as two-stage contagious diseases where the first stage is contracting the virus and the second stage is getting AIDS or cervical cancer, respectively. Since cervical cancer has received a lot of attention in the media recently, there is a reasonable amount of data available for it and hence we use it for model illustration as well as numerical analysis in this paper. In that light, it is worthwhile to further describe cervical cancer briefly. The cause for almost all patients suffering from cervical cancer is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) which can be controlled using vaccinations that lasts four years. When a healthy person contracts HPV, there are no symptoms until the person actually gets cancer, a process which may take many years (Cervical-Cancer 2006). Therefore the two-stages of cervical cancer can be thought of as: (a) having HPV but not cancer; (b) having cancer for which treatment is required (such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy (Cervical-Cancer-Center 2006)). On the brighter side, treatments for cervical cancer are fairly successful (AICR 2006). However the cost of treatment is significantly higher than many other cancers, such as breast cancer, hence not all patients can afford the treatment (Wolstenholme and Whynes 1998).",

However, it is worthwhile noting that policies from a management standpoint in terms of the spread of these diseases mentioned above have been well established. Where there is a serious shortcoming is in being prepared against newly emerging disease outbreaks in which human beings are infected by agents (such as bacteria or viruses) that spread even before any symptoms are observed. These agents could have a long incubation period (i.e. the time between when an individual is infected to when symptoms appear). In addition, the disease could be communicable (i.e. the agent spreads to other individuals) even during the incubation period. Under these circumstances there is a need to perform quick what-if analysis with limited data to make policy decisions. The major concern is the impact in terms of large-scale testing, vaccination, and treatment that would overwhelm existing resources. We seek to develop a strategy that aims to allocate a constrained budget between testing, vaccination, and treatment subsidy across a finite time horizon.",

Modeling and analyzing this problem deals with multi-dimensional decision variables under a stochastic-network environment. Thus, it difficult to analyze the system using dynamic programming. There are a relatively large number of states in this system and the transition rates are also dependent upon the state of the system. In essence, the budget allocation problem over a finite horizon is a complex stochastic dynamic program where the objective is to determine the optimal set of actions in each stage of the horizon which is a dynamic control problem with feedback. The contribution of this paper is in not only providing a tool for policymakers to effectively divide a given budget for a specific two-stage disease in healthcare, but also to develop a methodology to handle complex dynamic control problems effectively.",

Further, the problem is presented in detail, along with notations in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we characterize the system as a stochastic network under dynamic control with feedback and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). However due to the curse of dimensionality the MDP is intractable. Therefore we develop an asymptotically optimal solution based on a fluid model of the dynamics to solve the MDP in Sect. 5. We present extensive numerical results to evaluate the model performance on a wide experimental design benchmarking on a cervical cancer case study in the United States in Sect. 6. Then in Sect. 7 we evaluate the impact of various factors to develop insights for policy and healthcare. Finally in Sect. 8 we present our findings and make concluding remarks.",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling of epidemic diseases has been an active area of research since the 1920s. A number of statistical models have been developed in order to be able to predict various factors, such as the spread rate of the disease, the number of infected people, mortality rate, etc. within a given time horizon. Early research was mainly devoted to developing deterministic models. This is mainly due to the fact that these models are simpler. Anderson and May (1991) studied various existing deterministic models, along with several applications based on real data. Stochastic epidemic models started to come around with the one proposed by McKendrick (1926). This work was a stochastic continuous time version of the deterministic model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927). Reed and Frost introduced the chain-binomial model (Andersson and Britton 2000). Barlett (1949) studied the stochastic version of the Kermack-McKendrick model. Since then, a substantial amount of research has been done in this field. For example, Gabriel et al. (1990), Bailey (1975) and Anderson and May (1991) are excellent resources that have covered stochastic as well as deterministic models. These sources also discuss the statistical inference and a large number of applications to real data. Further, Daley and Ganni (1999) reviewed the existing stochastic and deterministic models and included statistical inference. Andersson and Britton (2000) provided a summary of stochastic models that are being used in the area. In addition, Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) focused on mathematical epidemiology of infectious diseases and used real data for illustrations.",

A mixed population is the basic assumption in that mode there are some infectious individuals (I) and some susceptible individuals (S). During the infectious period, an infective person makes contact with a susceptible individual with a given probability. Different researchers use different methods to obtain this probability, e.g., the contact number as defined by Hethcote (2000). If a susceptible person has contact with the infectious person, he/she becomes infectious and is immediately able to infect other individuals. There is usually a distribution assigned to the duration of the infectious period. An individual is considered removed (R) when he/she becomes immune to the disease after his/her infectious period is over, and plays no further part in the spread of the disease. Newmann (2002) showed that a large class of SIR models of epidemic disease can be solved exactly on wide variety of networks.",

The main differences are: There is higher chance getting AIDS after having the HIV than getting cervical cancer after being infected by HPV; The most common treatment for cervical cancer is by surgery (more costly) which is a one-time action, however in the case of AIDS the treatment is over time and by using drugs (less costly); The HPV vaccine is effective for 4 years and after that it should be repeated, but for HIV the chance of immunity is low but it remains for longer time.

But when the horizon is longer vaccination becomes more important because it helps to reduce the overall cost in future. In other words, longer horizon emphasizes on the value of future, which is exactly the reason for vaccinating. We compare the graphs, in the first 5 periods the short horizon model assigns most of the money to treatment whereas in long term horizon a significant portion of the budget was allocated to vaccination in the first 5 periods.",

Instead of fixing the vaccination cost and just changing the examination cost (which would have resulted in a smooth curve), we emphasize that besides the ratio, the individual cost parameters are also crucial. Therefore the figure shows the effect on number of vaccination and examination as the cost ratio (exam/vaccine) increases. The reason that the number of examination does not converge to zero even when it costs more than vaccination is that examination has two other advantages in our model: the people who know they have the virus have a smaller chance of getting cancer (they can take better care) and also a better chance of recovering.",

However, when the population size is not as large (small is still over 50,000) it appears as if it would make more sense to spend more on treatment than either of the other two options.

In our experiments the static policy took an average of 13 seconds using the deterministic methodology whereas 25 seconds on average with simulations. The dynamic policy without feedback was only fractionally slower. For that the deterministic version took 15 seconds and the simulation methodology took 27 seconds on average.

In particular, by comparing against existing HPV vaccination policy of vaccinating 70% of eligible population, our policy seems to perform much better in improving the objective function. In essence it would be worthwhile using the budget for examinations (essentially incentives) and treatment. Further, to study how the policies differ between HIV-AIDS and HPV. Since HIV vaccination is not as effective, it is natural to devote more of the budget to examination and treatment as compared to HPV. We also find that since the impact of vaccinations cannot be realized in a short time-horizon, the decisions are significantly different for both HPV and HIV. In addition, for both HIV and HPV as the population size becomes small it is more effective to use a larger fraction of the budget for treatment (as opposed to the large population where the budget is spent more-or-less evenly between testing, vaccination and treatment). Returning to the HPV incentives for examinations, it appears that using a weak incentive would favor more examinations versus vaccinations and vice versa (contradicting human behavior) forces policymakers to consider this issue more closely.",

In fact one could also include herd immunity which is gaining a lot of importance in large-scale vaccinations. Although we have not explicitly considered herd immunity, there is an implicit provision for that in our proposed framework. In particular, our model considers spread of disease as a function of the number of individuals who are not being vaccinated. This way, herd immunity can be incorporated into our proposed framework. However, considering the focus of this paper and space limitations, we feel herd immunity is best left as a limitation of our study.",
