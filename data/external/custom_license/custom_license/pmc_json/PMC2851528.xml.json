Thus, we are confident that such samples in the field will indicate seropositive animals. Because we are suggesting that this assay be used for identifying seropositive rodents and not for determining seroprevalence (although it appears to be adequate for those studies as well) and to be conservative, we considered only samples that appeared dark green (3+ and 4+) in the field assay to be positive with relative certainty. To minimize the complexity of the PAGEIA under field conditions, we did not use a negative control antigen to assess nonspecific reactivities of serum samples. Use of this test will allow deer mice with antibody to SNV to be identified. Deer mice are the population most likely to be naturally infected with that virus, and those rodents can be retained for further testing and for studies of tissues, live cells, and body fluids to be used for subsequent laboratory investigations, such as for determining cellular immunologic responses, viremia levels, viruria levels, and virus shedding in excreta and secreta.",

They found that serum specimens from both sigmodontine rodent species (deer mice and hispid cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus) they tested were recognized by protein-A and/or protein-G conjugates. Similar laboratory-based PAGEIAs have also been used to detect antibody to antigens of agents causing other infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like viruses and Nipah virus in bats (13\u201315).",
