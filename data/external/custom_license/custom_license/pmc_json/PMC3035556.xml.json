When it had been established that an outbreak was occurring, a SARS screening clinic was instituted to care for hospital staff with symptoms suggestive of or suspected to be SARS. Asymptomatic staff or those without compatible symptoms were also invited to participate in this study. In late March and early April 2003, a blood sample was collected from each HCW who voluntarily participated and who wished to be tested for antibody to SARS-CoV; a second blood sample was collected 4\u20136 weeks later. Most of the second blood samples were collected in early May 2003, approximately 8 weeks from the first peak and 4 weeks from the second peak of admission of HCWs with SARS (Figure). Each HCW completed a questionnaire to document known direct contact with SARS patients, their body fluids, secretions, or excretions; places of duty within the hospital; and symptoms of any illness during the period between first and second blood sample collection. Additional information also included the department and the position of HCWs, so that the job nature could be delineated.",

Alternatively, our data suggest that asymptomatic or mild forms of SARS-CoV are rare at the current point to which the virus has evolved. From the virologic viewpoint, this finding indicates that the novel coronavirus has not yet adapted to transmit among humans through asymptomatically infected hosts. This finding has important public health implications, as the level of immunity towards SARS-CoV could be very low even in members of communities that had had a large outbreak of SARS. If this is the case, a large proportion of the population remains susceptible, and another major outbreak may occur when the virus is introduced by highly infectious sources.",
