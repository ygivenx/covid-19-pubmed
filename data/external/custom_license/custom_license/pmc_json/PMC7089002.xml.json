            "text": "Research carried out in recent years has led to the conviction that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), in particular strains from the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobactrium, may promote health in man and animals. LAB possesses a number of properties that make them attractive candidates for oral vaccination purposes. These bacteria are considered to be \u2018safe\u2019 organisms with a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status. In addition, Lactobacilli are able to survive passage through the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and certain strains are capable of colonizing the intestinal tract [1\u20133]. These properties are particularly relevant when vaccines are to be applied in less industrialized countries. Furthermore, many bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens enter the body via the mucosal surfaces of the body. The first line of defense for humans and animals is found, not surprisingly, in the intestines, the largest immunological organ of the human body. More than 60% of antibodies produced daily are secreted into the GIT. Oral immunization frequently evokes both local and systemic immune responses, resulting in an effective elimination of foreign invaders [4\u20137]. These characteristics make them attractive candidates for delivering pharmaceutical compounds of interest to the mucosa, particularly vaccines and immunomodulators.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus that causes a highly contagious enteric disease in pigs, resulting in neonatal mortality and severe economical loses to the affected farms. The viral genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense 28.5 kb RNA and is constructed of three major structural proteins: S, M, and N, and a fourth structural protein, the small membrane (sM) protein [8, 9]. Protein S is the major inducer of TGEV neutralizing antibodies. The S protein has been used mainly for the induction of protective immunity against TGEV, and relevant neutralization epitopes have been mapped to the N-terminal domain of this protein. Four major antigenic sites have been described in glycoprotein S, of which site A is immunodominant [10\u201312]. The protection of suckling piglets against TGEV infection is based on the uptake of specific lactogenic antibodies, mainly of the IgA class, from the milk of the TGEV-immune sows [13, 14].",

The derivative is then covalently linked to an intracellular protein via the probe\u2019s succinimidyl group [15]. Briefly, a 100 mM stock solution of cFDA-SE was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted in ethanol (1 ml, reagent grade).

Fluorescent labeling was terminated by pelleting the bacteria. The labeled bacteria were washed twice in sterile PBS to remove excess cFDA-SE and resuspended in sterile PBS.

For many pathogens, the initial infection mainly occurs at the mucosa tissues of intestines. Therefore, it is important to develop vaccines that elicit protective immune responses against infection and replication of the pathogens at the mucosal level. Vaccines administered by parenteral routes generally fail to stimulate mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immunization is a proven, effective approach against colonization of pathogens and their further spread to the systemic circulation [4]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efficient and safe antigen vectors that could trigger mucosal and systemic immune responses. One promising approach relies on the use of live bacterial vehicles. The potential of recombinant LAB to deliver heterologous antigens to the mucosal immune system has been under investigation [25\u201327]. This approach offers a number of advantages over the traditional parenteral vaccination, such as non-invasiveness and the possibility to elicit both mucosal and systemic immune responses. A great deal of research, currently being explored for oral application, focused on the development of adequate mucosal vaccines with various vaccine delivery systems. Among available approaches that efficiently stimulate mucosal responses, the use of Lactococcus carriers to deliver vaccine antigens probably constitutes one of the most successful strategies.",

However, only a few of systems have been described using Lactobacillus casei strains as a carrier of heterologous viral antigens in a form that can be presented to and processed by the mammalian host [28]. The TGEV S protein was expressed by Lactobacillus casei [29]. Lactobacillus is the resident strain present in the intestinal tract of mammals. It may produce immunological tolerance, and a practical application for its use should be identified. IgA is the predominant antibody at the mucosal surface, as its local production is greater than other immunoglobulins. Therefore, an efficient TGEV oral vaccine should be able to induce a specific mucosal IgA response. We evaluated the immunogenicity of LNZ9000-rTGEV-SN using BALB/c mice as the animal model. The LNZ9000-rTGEV-SN produced both mucosal and systemic immune responses after intragastric administration. The oral administration regimen consisted of three sets of three successive daily doses of LNZ9000-rTGEV-SN by vaccination. This protocol was adapted from Challacombe\u2019s procedure [21], which was consistently effective when particulate oral vaccines were used to immunize mice. Three successive daily doses of recombinant bacteria were required in order to ensure that a systemic antibody response to TGEV could be elicited in all mice that received the recombinant strain, intragastrically.",
