While target-based screens were developed that utilized simple recombinant protein enzyme assays provided many advantages in terms of cost and scalability, they relied on the assumption that the selected target is in fact the best and most druggable target for a given disease. However, in the last decade, we have seen a clear shift back towards using phenotypic screens as an initials starting point for drug discovery, especially for neglected diseases for which the drug targets are generally poorly understood or where target-based approaches failed (1,2). An analysis of the origin of first-in-class small molecules proposed that phenotypic screens identified more novel inhibitors than other approaches between the years 1999 and 2008 (3). However, phenotypic screening has the disadvantage that it does not provide information about the target/s for a hit.",

            "text": "Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of 23 predominantly communicable diseases (Table I) that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions, affecting 149 countries, more than 1 billion people in the developing world (4,5), and costing those global economies billions of dollars every year. These 23 NTDs disproportionately impact poorer regions and contribute to substantial morbidity, disability and poverty in many low- and middle-income countries (6). It is important to realize that in many cases these pathogens are eukaryotic parasites which have complex life cycles and varied mechanisms for evading their host immune system. In addition, some of these parasites are not genetically tractable in the laboratory which further complicates drug discovery efforts. The inability to translate many of these pathogens into a lab setting is one reason for the lack of research into these diseases. Perhaps more critical is the absence of a lucrative market for NTD treatments. These diseases generally lack market incentives to spur product development (7\u20139). As a result, NTDs receive relatively little research investment ($80M - $500M / year) from governments or pharmaceutical companies, compared with the billions of dollars invested in diseases such as cancer and heart disease or other blockbuster diseases (10). Although these neglected diseases continue to lack major economic incentives due to their financially unattractive affected population, (7\u20139) there is a tropical disease priority review voucher awarded to companies that successfully develop FDA-approved treatments for particular diseases (11\u201313) (Table II) some of which overlap with the WHO definitions of tropical neglected diseases (Table I). This is anticipated to assist companies to focus on developing treatments for these diseases. Another way to overcome the challenges of NTD drug development is to reposition or repurpose existing drugs (15\u201322). Utilizing compounds that have already been approved by the FDA, compounds with known physicochemical and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties, can accelerate the development process of an old drug through financial and regulatory hurdles to market. The efficiency of a repurposing approach is especially critical for NTDs which typically do not have viable commercial products already approved or treatment paths that are economically feasible. In addition to the potential monetary benefits, the development of a repositioned product can shorten the timeframe for drug discovery from 10-17 years to 3-12 years which is especially important in cases where the spread of disease is rapid and costly (23,24).",

For small drug companies and biotech firms, it is more urgent to build valuable IP in order to compete with larger companies and so they are even less likely to find value in repurposing drugs. Due to the poor economic tradeoffs, a lot of repurposing efforts are being championed by academia. However, there are many recent examples of successful collaborations between industry, government, and academia, where large libraries of compounds are made available for high throughput screening including by Novo Nordisk (25), Novartis (26), GlaxoSmith Kline (27), Pfizer (28), and other companies as parts of consortia (e.g. More Medicines for TB (29,30), TB Drug Accelerator, NIH NCATS etc).",

These include NCATS (31) /NIH (32,33), Microsource (34\u201336), LOPAC (37), Prestwick (38), Broad (39), Calibr (40,41), bioactive libraries (42), small molecule libraries (43), collections of natural products (42), and others. The library that arguably provides the best benefit is the FDA approved library (44\u201348). Because this list seems to be updated sporadically and obtained from different sources, studies that refer to the library of FDA approved drugs describe a library ranging from 774 (45), to 1,012 (48) to 1,766 compounds (49). Johansen et al. extended this library to screen a combined 2,600 US and \u201cnon-US\u201d approved drugs in one study (50), and a combination of FDA approved drugs and \u201cex-US-approved drugs\u201d in another (51). Although diseases occurring throughout the globe can be impacted by these types of repurposing efforts, there are no studies identified that have screened libraries compiled by regulatory bodies of other countries with the intent of repurposing drugs for a neglected disease to our knowledge. While these regulatory bodies exist, they seem to be overlooked by most researchers trying to repurpose drugs for NTD\u2019s and the majority of \u201capproved\u201d compound screening uses the US FDA library.",

These diseases and variations of their associated terminology were searched in the literature using multiple search engines along with \u201chigh-throughput screen\u201d and \u201cidentified\u201d to find those papers in which screening was performed with some success. The ~7000 rare diseases often discussed alongside neglected diseases (54) were not considered for this study. The use of the Medicines for Malaria Ventures (MMV) box has been extensive and only a handful of those studies are presented here. Van Voorhis et al have a more complete compilation of that work (55). There are also considerable efforts in the development of assays (56\u201361), lead optimization (62,63), mechanism of action elucidation (64), and smaller scale repurposing studies for neglected diseases (65\u201371), but these were outside the scope of this investigation. Due to the number of people living with these neglected diseases and the urgency needed to respond to their emergence, studies involving high throughput screening for Dengue, Zika, and Ebola viruses were included as recent examples. In addition to presenting some of the work that has been done in the NTD repurposing field, we have compiled a database of over 1,200 compounds suggested for repurposing by the authors developed across the many studies summarized herein.",

The disease is a problem in Latin America where it is endemic, but it is also increasingly found in North America and Europe, which it reaches through immigration (73\u201375). The clinical signs of Chagas diseases are manifested in different phases. In all cases, the disease ultimately leads to death and the only available contingency plans rely on organ transplantation. The spread of Chagas disease to North America and beyond is highlighting the need for novel, safe, and effective therapeutics to treat T. cruzi infection.

The drug concentrations were 5 and 15 \u03bcM. The cascade was made up of an initial single-point primary screen, that was followed by a high content screening assay to determine potency, a static-cidality and rate-of-kill assessment, as well as an in vitro CYP51 activity determination (to measure the inhibition of agonist-induced calcium flux). Inhibitors that were found to interfere with calcium homeostasis were shown to have moderately slow killing profiles despite their high potency. The remaining hits were classified as central nervous system (CNS) targeting lipophilic amines. Based on potency, selectivity and cidal profiles, the most interesting drugs were determined to be ifenprodil, ziprasidone, clemastine, clofibrate and azelastine. All compounds have reasonable bioavailability but are currently limited by toxicity. Future work would have to be performed to eliminate the CNS penetration or H1 antagonism to make the compounds more suitable for treatment of T. cruzi in human targets (77). During the development of the above mentioned CYP51 assay, Riley et al., identified several hits mentioned briefly in a separate paper (78). They used the CYP51 enzyme of the Chagas parasite expressed in E. coli as a way to distinguish compounds with similar mechanisms of actions from those used by current drugs where resistance is a growing problem. 200,000 compounds were initially screened for their activity and the resulting hit compounds were represented by 129 compound classes. Compounds were de-prioritized based on chemical similarity to known treatments and the remaining hits, represented by 5 singletons, were suggested for repurposing (78).",

The surviving parasites were then assessed via detection of a luminescent reporter after cells were lysed. This group screened over 300,000 compounds, and over 4,000 were identified (hit rate ~1.4%). Compounds from this list were then prioritized based on the following characteristics: homology to known antifungal pharmacophores with anti-trypanosomal activity, compounds that contain a basic heterocycle and two additional lipophilic or aromatic moieties in a trigonal or tetrahedral arrangement around a central atom, synthetic tractability, novel structures to the field, and the extent to which structural domains influenced the activity. Fifteen lead hit structures were initially identified, and based on the mentioned criteria, seven were identified. In vitro activity studies against Trypanosoma cruzi and in vivo studies for toxicity further filtered the candidates down to CM100 (IC50 = 0.169 uM) and CM74 (IC50 = 0.075 \u03bcM) as promising therapeutics for Chagas disease (39).",

While there are treatments for this disease HAT drugs have historically had limitations relating to their administration, toxicity or cost. There are relatively few alternative drugs or validated drug targets which is driving research to identify parasite-specific antitrypanosomal lead compounds. Hence there have been efforts to develop a fluorometric viability assay for HTS (85\u201398). In a successful example of a partnership between industry and academia, 42,444 compounds were provided by GlaxoSmithKline and screened by Diaz et al., for growth inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei (27). 797 compounds showed activity against this sleeping sickness parasite while also not presenting signs of toxicity to human cells (27). Further analysis was performed to distinguish cell death vs. cell growth inhibition and 129 compounds that cause parasite death were grouped into clusters based on structural similarity (27).",

They screened 400 compounds from the malaria box against bloodstream T. b. rhodesiense and T. brucei and against intracellular amastigotes of T. cruzi and L. infantum (118). Out of 400 compounds, 4 passed initial in vitro screening, but failed in in vivo testing (118). The same year, Kaiser et al took 100 drugs with a high likelihood of repurposing and tested them against several neglected tropical disease parasites. They tested some of the more potent compounds in mouse models for the various diseases with mixed results (33). For activity against T. b. rhodesiense they show the antidepressants sertraline and paroxetine to be good repurposing candidates. Several were reported for the first time for having moderate anti-Chagas efficacy such as tadalafil, an erectile dysfunction drug, and mebeverine, an antispasmodic (33). Promazine and nortriptyline were also identified in this study as anti-malarial compounds alongside several tricyclic antidepressants (33).",

Regardless of format, most of the assays have focused on post-infective larvae (schistosomula), which are a relatively abundant stage of the parasite (Schistosoma mansoni being the \u2018model\u2019 schistosome) allowing for a reasonable screening throughput. The use of larval parasites is rationalized on the basis that the target product profile (TPP) for new anti-schistosomal drugs should encompass activity against immature schistosomes and not just mature parasites, as is the case with PZQ (139\u2013144). Hits identified against schistosomula are then screened in vitro for activity against the more limiting adult parasites (which must be harvested from small animals such as mice or hamsters) before being then considered for in vivo efficacy studies (134,145). This staged or tiered approach has involved the screening of both chemically diverse and focused chemical collections and has identified a variety of anti-schistosomal chemistries, including antibiotics (e.g., doramectin and clofazimine (34)), neuroactives (134), anti-cancer agents (e.g., trametinib and vandetanib (108)) protease inhibitors (134), thiosemicarbazones (146) and statin drugs used for hypercholesterolemia (147).

In vivo studies with mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni showed that a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg of the two drugs reduced worm burden by 52.5% (N,N9-diarylurea) and 40.8% (2,3-dianilinoquinoxaline). These two drugs represent a useful scaffold for preparing future small molecule inhibitors of S. mansoni (145). Apart from whole-organism screening, target\u2013based approaches to defining novel anti-schistosomals have been employed. Liu et al. identified multiple compounds for repurposing for schistosomiasis by performing a high throughput docking screen of 14,000 molecules against an enzyme (3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase) involved in fatty acid synthesis. Compounds were tested directly for inhibition in a worm study, and for cell toxicity, resulting in 2 final compounds that both impacted mortality rates while exhibiting low cytotoxicity in human cells (40).",

Compounds that inhibited motility by 75% were then screened against O. volvulus molting larvae and O. ochengi adult worms in MTT assay and motility assay.

Auranofin was next tested in vivo in gerbils infected with B. pahangi L3 by measuring the burden of Brugia adult worms after treatment for 28 days at 5 mg/kg. Gold plasma levels were also measured in the gerbils to assess the circulation time of the drug.

This is a cause of diarrhea, which is associated with significant mortality in developing countries. Two libraries of compounds were used for this study namely a bioactive (10,000 compound) set assembled by the California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr) and the Global Health Chemical Diversity Library (GHCDL; 69,000) that was obtained from the University of Dundee Drug Discovery Unit. In vitro cultivation of Cryptosporidium has not yet been established, so in vivo oocyst propagation of C. parvum in calves was used in this study. The five most potent compounds against C. parvum were found to be Go \u00a86976 (EC50 = 2.5 nM), monensin (EC50 = 7 nM), clofazimine (EC50 = 15 nM), cyclosporine (EC50 = 48 nM), and MST-312 (EC50 = 61 nM) (41). Go \u00a86976 is known as a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C and of the tyrosine kinases JAK 2 and FLT3. MST-312 is also known as Telomerase Inhibitor IX and is a potent and reversible inhibitor of telomerase activity, arresting cells in the G0-G1 phase during the cell cycle. Cyclosporine is relatively old drug that is an inhibitor of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and has well known potent immunosuppressive properties. Monensin is an inonophore antibiotic that is added to cattle feed, and finally clofazimine is an FDA-approved drug used for the treatment of leprosy that has recently also been evaluated for tuberculosis. However, only clofazimine showed a promising safety profile. Future work is still needed to establish whether clofazimine is targeting a parasitic pathway or modulating a host-mediated pathway essential to the parasite proliferation (41).",

The presence of multiple serotypes is a challenge for successful anti-viral strategies as it places our own immune strategies at a disadvantage. The disease can progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever, also called severe dengue, which is most likely to occur in secondary infections and can be potentially fatal (163). A 2013 review by Lim et al. summarized some important work concerning repurposing for dengue (164) and discusses two strategies used for dengue drug therapy namely, inhibiting viral targets or inhibiting host targets. In recent work by Cruz et al, cell-based screening of 4,000 small molecules was performed on 4 different serotypes of the dengue virus in host cells resulting in 157 active compounds with 4 general structural scaffolds (162). If compounds were toxic to host cells the virus would die and this test would not distinguish between the two effects. Several scaffolds of compounds were identified as being toxic to multiple sources of the dengue virus. With the use of confocal microscopy and time-of-addition assays further insight was gained into the potential mechanism of action of broad-spectrum hits. It was determined that 2-aminothiazole was not interfering with viral entry, but was likely blocking virus assembly. This was hypothesized based on structural similarity to the more-well studied dasatinib (162).",

Importantly, the authors also considered the relative risk of these identified compounds if they were to be used during pregnancy. Of the 13 candidate drugs only three fell into pregnancy category B, described as when \u201cAnimal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.\u201d The three compounds in this category were daptomycin, mefloquine HCl, and palonosetron HCl. Daptomycin is an anti-microbial, mefloquine HCl is an anti-parasitic that disrupts autophagy, and palonosetron HCl is a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist with drug interactions with SSRIs. All other compounds identified for anti-Zika activity were in the C and D pregnancy categories, where adverse effects have been observed in either humans or animals (45).",

Gene enrichment analysis was used to analyze the biological processes and molecular functions that are required for viral infection. Karlas et al. next assessed the antiviral activity of chemical compounds that target the identified proviral factors involved in chikungunya replication (193). They utilized specialized drug databases to identify 52 compounds that interact with gene products of 14 distinct chikungunya proviral genes, and 20 compounds were shown to interact with six distinct proviral factors or pathways. RNAi (RNA interference) screens showed that five out of six proviral factors were druggable. Special knockout mice were generated to study these results in vivo, and it was demonstrated that tivozanib significantly reduced chikungunya viral load in vital organs.

In some instances, academics are able to partner with companies or increasingly they have access to their own large libraries of compounds that they can screen, to produce hundreds or tens of compounds with high likelihood of repurposing. Some of these groups have the tools and access to perform in vivo work and suggest clinical studies as well. Other groups perform in vitro screening and suggest follow-up with in vivo studies. Those various researchers using computational tools such as, molecular dynamics, docking, and machine learning models can provide considerable insight to specific mechanisms, perform high throughput screening very quickly, and even leverage machine learning to predict novel structures. However, it is common for these scientists to conclude with suggestions for validation in vitro and in vivo. Ideally this should be performed at the same time. From our own experience of collaborations on Chagas disease we have been able to go from in silico to in vitro to in vivo in a single study (79) and then for Ebola we went from in silico to in vitro in one study (187) and in vivo efficacy study in another (188).

            "text": "Repurposing drugs for neglected diseases likely requires the successful integration of multiple fields; it also helps to be aware of promising compounds and conversely potentially difficult compounds. Occasionally we see the same compound having disparate activities. For example clofazimine as an anti-trypanosomal agent (34) and active against Cryptosporidium parvum (41), and pyronaridine active against Chagas disease (79) and Ebola (187) (Fig. 2). Fexinidazole, which recently completed clinical trials for HAT (201), is also being considered for treatment of Chagas (202,203). Such molecules that have multiple potential activities against neglected tropical diseases may be more common than we think and could point to common targets across diseases. Further screens like those described herein will help identify such compounds and bring more treatments into the pipelines for these diseases. We hope that this review will inspire others to search for new molecules for NTDs.",
