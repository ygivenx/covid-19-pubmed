Far less is known about the consequences of landscape heterogeneity, and of changes in landscape composition and configuration, for parasites and pathogens. As humans alter landscape pattern, a number of impacts on parasites and their hosts and vectors are likely to occur. Of particular relevance are changes in the abundance and species richness of host and vector species. These occur in response to changes in such variables as habitat structure, resource availability, predation rates, and ease of dispersal (With and Crist 1995; Flather and Sauer 1996). Unless all hosts and all vectors are equally competent, changes in host and/or vector communities can be expected to alter the transmission rates of parasites (and their overall prevalence within the host community) by altering the numbers of suitable and available hosts (Kruess and Tscharnkte 1994; Brisson et al. 2011), the number of successful transmission events that occur by either direct contact or via vectors, and/or the prevalence of infectious individuals among susceptible hosts (Roche et al. 2012).",

            "text": "The problem of deriving general principles from which to predict impacts of landscape change on parasite communities is complicated by a set of indirect and idiosyncratic effects. For example, more diverse host communities may exhibit lower infection rates because more \u2018wasted bites\u2019 on incompetent vector species occur (Dobson et al. 2006). Conversely, communities that are more diverse to begin with will be more likely to retain at least some highly competent hosts and vectors following anthropogenic habitat modification. Changes in landscape composition and configuration can influence dispersal rates and bring domestic and wild species (and people) into contact with one another, further altering parasite and pathogen dynamics. For instance, deforestation has been blamed for outbreaks of human malaria in the Amazon Basin (Vittor et al. 2006), cutaneous leishmaniasis in Costa Rica (Chaves et al. 2008), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in South East Asia (Field 2009). Urbanization has similarly been linked to the proliferation of zoonotics such as Lyme disease (LoGiudice et al. 2003) and rabies (Singh et al. 2001).",

(2009) identified a decline in species richness at upper trophic levels between protected (and mostly intact) and non-protected (fragmented) landscapes. Similarly, urbanization can have a negative effect on habitat quality and correspondingly on avian species richness in greater Cape Town (Dures and Cumming 2010). These changes would be expected to both directly and indirectly affect parasite and pathogen prevalence. In the USA, research on West Nile Virus (WNV) showed that an increased prevalence of antibodies for WNV in songbirds corresponded to an increasing scale of urbanization (Bradley et al. 2008). In American wetlands, WNV prevalence decreased with increasing wetland size (Ezenwa et al. 2007). Similarly, wetland size has been linked to resource availability (Paracuellos and Tell\u00e9ria 2004), and may subsequently affect local avian species richness as a result.",

First, we predicted that infection prevalence would be influenced by the composition of the surrounding landscape, and especially of urban areas, since these adversely impact bird species diversity and richness (Fair child et al. 2009; Dures and Cumming 2010). Species diversity and species richness have both been linked to infection prevalence (Keesing et al. 2006; Swaddle and Calos 2008). Second, we predicted that infection prevalence would be affected by the perimeter\u2013area ratio and connectivity of habitats, as these potentially influence encounter rates between pathogens and hosts (as described above from other disease systems; viz Singh et al. 2001; Vittor et al. 2006; Chaves et al. 2008).

Sites were situated along an urban to rural gradient and restricted to altitudes of 0\u2013300 m above sea level (Fig. 1).

This result is comparable to the outcomes from related studies on disease prevalence in various landscapes, where infection prevalence varied significantly between different vegetation types (Boone et al. 2000), and to more general studies that have indicated a larger effect of habitat amount than of habitat configuration (e.g., Flather and Bevers 2002). Other studies on vector-borne disease prevalence and landscape composition and configuration have, however, indicated that both land use and connectivity can also play primary roles in influencing disease prevalence (Linard et al. 2007; Vanwambeke et al. 2010). These outcomes suggest that host and vector ecology not only contribute to the influence of landscape factors in vector-borne disease, but also affect the magnitude of their influence.",

It is feasible that the same mechanisms may be in effect in the Western Cape of South Africa, where crops can provide a rich nutrient source for the larvae of avian malaria vectors. Additionally, irrigation practices in agricultural landscapes in the Western Cape (Venter 2005) facilitate vector breeding and development, as virtually all avian malaria vectors have a water-dependent stage in their lifecycle (Valki\u016bnas 2005).",

The largest influence of landscape structural factors was at local extents (1\u20135 km) and restricted to specific landscape types (agricultural and urban). This was also an indication that factors pertaining to species richness with the most influence on prevalence patterns were most intense at close proximity (Table 2). The low passerine species richness and correspondingly low infection prevalence in urban areas (Figs. 2, 3) suggested that most sampled passerine species either do not adapt well to urban environments; or that predominantly infected birds (from the Ploceidae) are not the dominant bird species in urban wetlands. Wetlands in urban landscapes had similarly lowest values for passerine species richness\u2013further indicating that many wetland passerines avoid urban landscapes (as do many other species; e.g., see McKinney 2002; Bradley et al. 2008). An alternative explanation is that the encounter rate in urban landscapes between passerine hosts and malarial pathogens is much lower than in other landscapes due to a lack of infectious vectors and/or susceptible hosts (Roche et al. 2012). Host adaptability to the landscape can have similarly significant implications for host viability and disease prevalence. Piersma (1997) postulated that some avian species are restricted to parasite-poor habitats as a trade-off with investing in immunocompetence, resulting in some species spending much more energy migrating to parasite-poor habitats in order to avoid infection. This hypothesis prompts several considerations: for instance, are migratory birds less prevalently infected than resident species? Do urban landscapes qualify as \u2018parasite-poor\u2019 habitats in the avian malaria model? There is also the possibility that birds act as sources of disease, as was the case in Chicago, USA, where migratory birds were the main hosts promoting the invasion of ticks (including non-endemic species) into the city (Hamer et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Patterns of disease across a landscape are often the consequence of spatially explicit and interlinked factors that respond similarly to changes in landscape structure (Patz et al. 2000). The response of pathogens and hosts to changes in the landscape may vary widely. Our findings contrast with those from a West African study on avian malaria, which reported a higher prevalence of avian malaria in undisturbed habitats compared to modified (deforested) habitats (Chasar et al. 2009). In our study, undisturbed habitats (fynbos) had lower infection prevalence than agriculturally modified habitats (agricultural and viticultural). Our findings also contrast with several other related studies, where the prevalence of a variety of diseases in wildlife populations increased with, or was promoted by, urban land development (Singh et al. 2001; Farnsworth et al. 2005). On the other hand, a human malaria study found a lower prevalence in urban areas, which concurred with outcomes seen in this study (Omumbo et al. 2005). Our overall impression is therefore that landcover can act as either a positive and negative influence on disease, with its exact role being co-dependent upon a diversity of mechanisms in host and vector ecology (Patz et al. 2000).",
