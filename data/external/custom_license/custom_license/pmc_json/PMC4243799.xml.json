I saw the difficulties firsthand when I became Commissioner of Public Health for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1975. Most of the population believed that public health was limited to public hospitals and clinics caring for the poor. Getting resources to address serious risk factors such as smoking, poor nutrition, and sedentary lifestyles was very difficult. At that time, most legislators in Massachusetts felt that bad health habits, including drug and alcohol abuse, were individual decisions and not within the purview of government to try to prevent or ameliorate.",

After a year of consulting on how to improve governmental public health in Los Angeles County and collaborating with other public health experts to develop many recommendations that were adopted by the county governing body, I accepted the job as county Director of Public Health. Public health was housed within the larger County Department of Health Services and constituted a small portion of its workforce and budget. Public health issues and concerns were often overshadowed by constant crises in health services financing and quality of care. These uniformly took precedence over public health's efforts to hire new staff and to strengthen internal capacity in areas such as chronic disease control, environmental health, and analytics.",

Local news channel KCBS-TV aired an investigative report that used hidden cameras to reveal egregious food safety violations in Los Angeles restaurants, attracting considerable media attention and provoking public outcry. The news coverage inspired strong public support for holding restaurants more accountable for food safety. A visible restaurant grading system, previously unfeasible due to almost certain opposition by the politically strong restaurant association, was now possible. We were able to develop a system that both changed the incentives for retail food establishments and protected the public's health. Restaurant letter grades (A, B, C), prominently posted at the entrance of all food establishments, quickly became an identifiable trademark of public health. These simple letter grades helped establish a public health \u201cbrand\u201d and distinguished the field from the direct delivery of health care services. This event also illustrated the importance of our ability to respond rapidly to public health needs. Indeed, being nimble and politically sensitive are important keys to advancing public health programs, whether for health protection, disease prevention, or health promotion.",

For me, it was important for public health to have a face, and that the face was the Health Officer, who under state law had broad responsibility and authority. I believe that in every community, Health Officers should be seen as the leader responsible for protecting human health. In the role of Health Officer, I've made many media appearances focused on educating the public about current health issues and teaching people how to better protect themselves from infectious and chronic diseases, environmental hazards, and other health threats. Visibility has also meant increasing the department's presence at the state and national levels. The involvement of local Health Officers at state and national levels is critical because they give authoritative voice to health problems at local levels, from environmental threats to substance abuse to food. Such local-level problems are often difficult to address due to barriers embedded in state and federal laws or regulations.",

I have also been criticized for allocating too few or too many resources to a particular health problem or to 1 or more racial groups or geopolitical units and for not being sensitive enough to the concerns of the organizations we regulate. If you are committed to a proactive health-promoting agenda, you cannot avoid criticism.

Just as I have focused locally on establishing my department in Los Angeles as the local voice of reliable health information and data, an important role for the BCHC is to identify and analyze the best science and collectively advocate for policies and programs that can improve health at the population level. To be an effective advocate for public health in big cities, the BCHC needs to be the \u201cgo-to\u201d resource for questions from legislators on health-relevant policy and programmatic issues.",

As such, large metropolitan area public health departments are often the first to recognize and develop strategies to address the most burning issues of the day.

Our work with the City of Los Angeles highlights the importance of support and vision from elected officials; we worked closely with local agencies on the development of the Health and Wellness chapter, as well as on other health-promoting initiatives. A specific example of collaborative planning is that we have made significant progress in transforming many Los Angeles neighborhoods to become more walkable and bikeable through strategic partnerships with other county agencies, local businesses, and community groups. These efforts, among others, have led to the recent recognition of Los Angeles as a bike-friendly community for the first time in 20121 after being referred to as \u201can almost pathologically bike-unfriendly city\u201d by Slate Magazine in years prior.2",

Making changes that will impact these health problems can take decades to show results. Meeting both public health and political goals requires a balanced portfolio of programs and policies that includes those with a rapid political return to help politicians demonstrate progress aligned with the election cycle.

Currently, the United States is ranked 26th in life expectancy and 31st in infant mortality out of 40 countries by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.4 To date, we have not yet succeeded in getting the layperson to grasp this critical issue. When asked to name the most important thing that can be done to improve health in Los Angeles County, my response is, \u201cThat's easy: Increase the high school graduation rate.\u201d This response frequently elicits a blank look.

In your professional role, assess each aspect in which your organization is ahead or behind. Look to your peers to compare and contrast circumstances and opportunities, taking into consideration community health status, programming, and the policy and economic environment. Consider how to best prioritize opportunities based on this assessment.Borrow and lend ideas, challenges, successes, and failures. As the saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. What might be considered infringement in the private sector is ideal in the public sector. It is gratifying when other jurisdictions borrow from a policy or program that Los Angeles has implemented and make it their own. And we haven't hesitated to borrow innovations from other public health agencies.Practice humility. Sometimes it is important to apologize, even for mistakes you may not believe you have made.
