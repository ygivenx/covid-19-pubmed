As indicated by a shift to the right in histograms [Figure 3b, 4b], the CD69 expression on cells was increased after 24 hours. As the cells were activated, the amount of the fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to them increased. The LI moderately stimulated the expression of CD69 on lymphocytes in a concentration-independent manner in the range of 100-800 \u03bcg/ml. Values of the activation index (AI) of total lymphocytes treated with LI in the range of 100-800 \u03bcg/ ml did not differ significantly among them (P < 0.05), but were lower than the AI value exhibited by cells treated with PHA [Figure 3d]. The LI showed a similar effect on T cells, but on a lower scale [Figure 4d]. Compounds 1 and 2 in the range of 12-100 \u03bcg/ml did not stimulate the CD69 expression on lymphocytes [Figure 3c, 4c]. It was observed that the LI, 1, and 2 showed no meaningful effect on cell cycle progression of lymphocytes. Most of the lymphocytes treated with LI, 1, and 2 were in G1 phase, and there was only a very small number of cells in S or G2 phases. The PHA stimulated lymphocytes to enter into the S and G2 phases after 72 hours of culture [Figure 5].",

The TF contents were 2.09 mg/100 mg and 4.27 mg/100 mg of the extract, measured by the AlCl3 and Al(NO3)3 methods, respectively.[14] Most reports on the flavonoid content in licorice are usually based on flavanones and chalcone such as liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and their corresponding aglycones.[3] Unlike flavanones from licorice, other types of minor flavonoids such as flavones and flavonols have been shown to exhibit strong antioxidant effects.[15] To date, there is very limited information on the TT content in the roots of Glycyrrhiza species. Two flavonoids, named licochalcone B and glycyrrhisoflavone, were isolated from an acetonic- aqueous extract of licorice and they exhibited tannin-like activity.[15] Glycyrrhizin has been reported to constitute 10-25% of licorice extract[16] and the liquiritigenin glycosides were reported to constitute 1.6% of licorice aqueous extract.[17] As can be noticed, the comparison between the values reported by different laboratories can be complicated because of substantial differences in sample preparation, geographic sources, harvesting, and expression of results.",

Adaptive immune responses are based on the activities of T lymphocytes (also called T cells) and B lymphocytes (B cells). The key to the adaptive immune system is the presence of the extremely variable antigen-specific receptors of the T lymphocytes (called TCRs) and B lymphocytes (called B-cell receptors [BCRs], immunoglobulins, or antibodies). NK cells are part of the lymphoid lineage but are distinct from T and B lymphocytes because they do not express the specialized receptors associated with the adaptive immune response. Instead they have two other types of receptors that determine their ability to identify and kill targeted host cells: Killer activation receptors and killer inhibition receptors. NK cells are important elements in innate defenses against virally infected and cancerous host cells.[21]",

In addition, by comparing the AI of total lymphocytes with those of T cells, it was observed that about 50% of the activation of total lymphocytes could proceed from the T cells activation. Although the effect of LI on the CD69 expression was moderate, this fact could be hypothetically interpreted as beneficial, given that increased level of CD69 expression on T cells has been associated with some autoimmune diseases.[2224] Licorice has multiple constituents and not one active ingredient; therefore, it is possible that they are able to act in a regulatory way, both activating and modulating the immune response. It is also questionable whether the LI immunostimulating effect is long-term because the CD69 expression on the surface of immune cells not only occurs very rapidly, but also declines rapidly (disappearing after two days). Therefore, this study measured the CD25 expression, a later-expressed activation marker, but the expression was very low (data are not shown). Apparently, regular consumption of licorice infusion would be important for its long-term effect.",

Mechanisms for antiviral activity included the reduced transport to the membrane and sialylation of viral surface antigen, reduction of membrane fluidity leading to inhibition of fusion of the viral membrane with the cell, induction of interferon gamma in t-cells, inhibition of phosphorylating enzymes in vesicular stomatitis virus infection, and reduction of viral latency.[4]",

It has been suggested in different systems that CD69 expression may precede cell proliferation, maturation or differentiation.[28] Nevertheless, the CD69 expression may not completely overlap with cells that undergo DNA synthesis following antigen receptor engagement. Although the immunologic consequences of lymphocyte clonal expansion are well established and critical to the development of immunity, the relevance of CD69 expression to this process is less understood.[29] The emerging data from the present study suggests that the LI-activated lymphocytes express CD69 as a result of a proliferation-independent process.
