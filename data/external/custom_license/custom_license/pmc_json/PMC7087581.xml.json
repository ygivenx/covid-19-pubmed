Afterwards, GIST was either used as an inclusive term to refer mesenchymal tumors regardless of their differentiation phenotype [1] or as an exclusive term for mesenchymal tumors that do not differentiate into Schwann cells or smooth-muscle cells [2]. The terminology was in flux and, for example, gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumor, as known as plexosarcoma, was used when tumors of this kind show ultrastructural features of complex interdigitating cell processes, neurosecretory granules, and intermediate filaments. The estimated incidence of GIST, in the sense of such heterogeneous neoplasms, was approximately 6.8 per million [3].\n",

Several investigators showed that 52\u201392% of GISTs harbored KIT mutation [11\u201313] and approximately 35% of GISTs lacking mutated KIT had PDGFRA mutation [14]. The discovery of mutations of these genes in GISTs is important from a therapeutic point of view because GISTs harboring such a mutation respond to imatinib mesylate (Glivec, Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) [15]. In addition to the therapeutic implication, mutation analysis can provide an additional diagnostic indicator for some GISTs that are immunonegative for CD117 [16, 17]. These CD117-negative GISTs are likely to be overlooked unless mutated KIT or PDGFRA genes are identified in the tumor. In this regard, the incidence of GIST, including the CD117-negative ones, remains to be estimated. These data are important to healthcare providers regarding the availability of imatinib mesylate, a remarkably effective [18] and expensive therapeutic agent for GISTs.\n\n",

There was no statistical difference (P=0.68) among these ratios, suggesting that approximately 4.86% (521/10,725) of patients with GI malignancies in Taiwan were treated at our hospital in 1998 regardless of the anatomical locations of the cancers. Similarly, the ratios of esophageal, gastric, small intestinal, and colorectal cancers in 1999 were 4.23, 4.77, 7.11, and 4.67%, respectively, and were not significantly different among them (P=0.33).

Because the clinical presentation of GISTs is indistinguishable from that of other GI cancers, it is not unreasonable to assume that GISTs that were newly diagnosed in our hospital also accounted for a similar percentage of the newly diagnosed GISTs in Taiwan. Therefore, the estimated number of GIST patients in Taiwan was 303.60 (14.33/4.72%) during the period 1998\u20132000. Because the average population in Taiwan was 22,099,217, the incidence of GIST would be approximately 13.74 per million Taiwanese (303.60/22,099,217).",

Including both immunohistochemical analysis of CD117 expression as well as mutational analysis of KIT and PDGFRA for the diagnosis of GISTs, we calculated that the annual incidence of GIST in Taiwan is 13.74 per million. Our estimated incidence is much higher than that of a recent study in the United States [3], which was based on the data of the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) registries. They reported an incidence rate of 6.8 per million and speculated that their incidence may be overestimated because of possible inclusion of non-GIST tumors in their calculation. Based on our finding that about 36% of GISTs would be misdiagnosed as other mesenchymal tumors if immunohistochemical and molecular analyses are not employed in the diagnosis, we believed the SEER's rate was in fact underestimated. However, it should be addressed that the SEER data did not include GISTs that were diagnosed as benign tumors; therefore, the SEER's rate probably reflected the incidence of GISTs with high or intermediate risk of malignancy.",

The difference between these two rates could be explained by our inclusion of CD117-negative GISTs if racial factors were ignored. The incidence of GIST in Taiwan is slightly lower than that in Sweden, where the annual incidence of 14.5 per million was reported [9]. The true annual incidence of GISTs in Sweden would probably be higher if CD117-negative GISTs were included. The slight difference in the annual incidences between Taiwan and Sweden could be explained, at least in part, by the autopsy cases. None of the GISTs analyzed in this study were identified from the autopsy cases, whereas 10% of GISTs in Sweden's study were incidentally identified at the time of autopsy [9]. In addition, the difference could also be explained by racial variation in that the SEER study pointed out a significant difference in incidence between Asian Pacific Islanders (10.3 per million) and Whites (6.0 per million) [3]. In this regard, the population in Taiwan comprises predominantly Han Chinese and a small portion of indigenous peoples that consist of nine aboriginal tribes of undetermined origin.",
