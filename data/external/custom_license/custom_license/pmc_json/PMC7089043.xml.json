Among the enteric viral markers, human adenoviruses (HAdVs) and human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) have been most widely used to detect human wastewater pollution in environmental waters (Fong et al. 2005; Hundesa et al. 2006; McQuaig et al. 2009). HAdVs are responsible for a wide array of diseases such as gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, eye infections, acute hemorrhagic cystitis, and meningoencephalitis (Videla et al. 1998; Echavarr\u00eda 2008). On the other hand, HPyVs are unique to humans and generally produce asymptomatic viruria, especially in immunocompromised people (Polo et al. 2004). HPyVs are frequently excreted in urine from healthy individuals. Due to the high abundances of HAdVs and HPyVs in human feces and urine, they have received significant attention as MST markers (Fong et al. 2005; Hundesa et al. 2006; McQuaig et al. 2009; Ahmed et al. 2016).",

Enteric viruses need to be concentrated from environmental water samples prior to PCR/qPCR analysis. The most commonly used concentration methods are hollow-fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF) (Rodriguez-Diaz et al. 2009), ultracentrifugation (Nordgren et al. 2009), adsorption-elution-based protocol with glass wool filter (GWF) (Lambertini et al. 2008), and positively and negatively charged membranes (Katayama et al. 2002; Bennett et al. 2010). The ability to recover maximum numbers of viruses from various water matrices, however, can be highly variable depending on the concentration methods used (Haramoto et al. 2006; Dubois et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Enteric viruses are relatively difficult to concentrate from environmental waters due to their low occurrence and small size (Maier et al. 2008). Therefore, recovery of viruses from environmental waters requires filtration on the scale up to 100 L of sample depending on the magnitude of fecal pollution. Among the most commonly used concentration methods, HFUF has been used widely to recover viruses from environmental waters with recovery rates ranging from 50 to 90 % (Morales-Morales et al. 2003; Hill et al. 2005; Hill et al. 2007; Polaczyk et al. 2008). Sodocalcic GWF also offers a promising alternative as an adsorptive material for virus concentration. GWF has been used to concentrate viruses from human wastewater (Gantzer et al. 1997) and environmental waters (Hot et al. 2003; Ehlers et al. 2005). Albinana-Gimenez et al. (2009a) compared GWF and ultrafiltration cartridge to recover known quantities of HAdV 2 and John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCPyV) in source water and drinking water using quantitative PCR. Both methods produced similar recovery efficiencies for HAdV 2 (GWF 4.2 %, ultrafiltration 5.1 %) but ultrafiltration had higher efficiencies (19 %) for JCPyV compared to GWF (4.4 %). Based on the results, the authors concluded that the GWF method produced acceptable and reproducible recovery efficiencies, whereas the ultrafiltration method yielded variable recovery efficiencies. It has to be noted that Albinana-Gimenez et al. (2009b) seeded cultured human adenoviruses type 2 (HAdV 2) and JCPyV obtained from plaque assays. In a real-world scenario, fecal pollution of environmental waters would occur via human wastewater/septic overflows. Little has been documented on the recovery efficiencies of HFUF and GWF methods for concentrating HAdVs and HPyVs markers from environmental water samples seeded with raw human wastewater.",

The method involves concentrating water samples using a Hemoflow HF80S dialysis filter (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homberg, Germany). Briefly, each 10-L water sample was pumped with a peristaltic pump in a closed loop with high-performance, platinum-cured L/S 36 silicone tubing (Masterflex; Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Chicago, Illinois, USA). At the end of the concentration process, pressurized air was passed through the filter cartridge from the top to recover approximately 100 to 150-mL concentrated sample in the retentate container. To improve recovery, after each sample was processed through the HFUF, 500 mL of a surfactant solution (0.01 % Tween 80, [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri] 0.01 % NaPP, and 0.001 Antifoam A [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA]) was recirculated through the filter until the system started to draw air. This elution solution was collected and added to the retentate to achieve a final volume of approximately 250\u2013300 mL and stored at 4 \u00b0C. A new filter cartridge was used for each sample. The pH of the concentrated sample was adjusted to 3.5 using 2.0 N HCl. The sample was then passed through 0.45-\u03bcm HA negatively charged 90-mm membranes (HAWP09000; Merck Millipore Ltd, Sydney, Australia) (McQuaig et al. 2009) attached to a glass membrane holder (Merck Millipore Ltd., Sydney, Australia).

Consequently, the pH of the concentrated sample was adjusted to 3.5 (below the isoelectric point of the viruses). The concentrated samples were further passed through negatively charged HA membranes which adsorb the positively charged viruses present in the sample. HFUF has been used for concentrating HPyVs, human Bacteroides HF183, and Methanobrevibacter smithii from 10 L of environmental water samples seeded with 5 or 2.5 mL raw human wastewater (Leskinen et al. 2010). Leskinen et al. (2010) extracted DNA directly from the 47-mm membranes using a PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit. One limitation of using smaller diameter membranes is that they may get clogged depending on the turbidity of the water. As a result, multiple membranes may be required which may increase the sample processing time and may reduce recovery efficiency. In addition, DNA extraction using a PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit does not utilize all supernatant which may also influence the recovery efficiency in the downstream application. In view of these, we processed river water samples through 0.45-\u03bcm, 90-mm diameter negatively charged membranes. The larger diameter membranes provide larger net area (4.5 times more than 47-mm membranes) which allow to process relatively large volume of concentrated water samples (250\u2013300 mL). For DNA extraction, we used PowerMax\u00ae Soil DNA Isolation Kit which can easily accommodate 90-mm diameter membrane. Unlike PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit, PowerMax\u00ae Soil Kit utilizes all supernatant and because of that better recovery is expected (Ahmed et al. 2015). A limitation of such approach can be the presence of potential PCR inhibitors on the membranes. However, the PowerMax\u00ae Soil Kit is equipped with inhibitor removal technology which potentially removes 100 % humic substances and other inhibitors as specified in the manual. This was supported by the Sketa22 real-time PCR assay which indicated the absence of PCR inhibitors in river water samples seeded with human wastewater obtained through both methods. It should be noted that 2-mL DNA sample was obtained using the PowerMax\u00ae Soil Kit which is 10\u201320 times higher than PowerSoil\u00ae DNA Isolation Kit or other commercially available DNA extraction kits such as Qiagen Stool kit. This may reduce sensitivity of the qPCR assay. However, to increase qPCR sensitivity, 2-mL DNA can be reconcentrated further to a suitable volume (if required).",

Our findings are in accordance with research by Morales-Morales et al. 2003; Hill et al. 2005; 2007; and Polaczyk et al. 2008 who also reported that HFUF can be effective for higher recovery (50\u201390 %) of viruses from various water matrices. In addition, HFUF is rapid and it does not require the preparation of extensive chemicals. The method also simultaneously retains bacteria, protozoa, and viruses in a single step which is an added advantage when analysis of multiple pathogens is required (Kfir et al. 1995; Oshima 2001; Morales-Morales et al. 2003).",

            "text": "GWF method used in this study was originally developed for detecting viruses and later it was used to detect agricultural zoonotic pathogens in large volume of drinking water, surface water, groundwater, and agricultural runoff (Vilagines et al. 1993; Millen et al. 2012). This approach has been successfully used to provide information of the recovery efficiencies of bacteria and viruses in 20 L of environmental water samples amended with variable amount of agricultural soil (Abd-Elmaksoud et al. 2014). The recovery efficiencies of bovine coronavirus, bovine rotavirus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 and type 2 using GWF have been reported to range from 13 to 26 % (at turbidity 0.5 NTU), 9 to 23 % (turbidity 215 NTU), and 14 to 24 % (turbidity 447 NTU), respectively. However, the standard deviations for each water type and virus varied significantly. The mean recovery efficiencies of HAdVs and HPyVs in this study for GWF ranged from 1.3 to 3.4 % for river water samples. Our findings are in accordance with Albinana-Gimenez et al. 2009b who also reported 4.2 % HAdVs and 4.4 % HPyVs recovery through GWF method. Francy et al. 2013 also reported 4.7 % recovery of HAdVs from lake water samples. Lower recovery efficiencies of other viruses such as H1N1 influenza and feline calicivirus F9 through the GWF method have been reported (Gassilloud et al. 2003; Deboosere et al. 2011). Caution should be exercised when comparing published studies on recovery efficiency of viral concentration methods as several factors such as adsorption of viruses to glass wool filters, glass wool filter type, seeding materials (raw human wastewater vs. intact plaques), environmental sample type (ground water vs. river water), sample volume (10 L vs. 50 L), and sensitivity of qPCR assays can influence recovery efficiencies (Bofill-Mas et al. 2006; Albinana-Gimenez et al. 2009a; Li et al. 2010).",

            "text": "The low recovery efficiencies of HAdVs and HPyVs could be due to the fact that viruses adsorbed on the glass wool filters were not effectively eluated. This assumption needs to be tested by directly extracting DNA from a segment of glass wool. The amount of glass wool packed into cam lever couplings may have affected the recovery efficiencies. For example, Vilagines et al. 1993 used 50-g glass wool which resulted in 75 % poliovirus 1 recovery compared to Menut et al. (1993) who used 5-g glass wool, which resulted in 25.5 % recovery. Glass wool filters are currently packed by hand and not commercially available in a column format. This makes QA/QC difficult as packing may vary from person to person, resulting in large variability in results (Cashdollar and Wymer 2013). In addition, viruses in the elution buffer also underwent an additional concentration step in a JumboSep before DNA extraction. Reconcentration of viruses is commonly used approach because the levels of viruses in environmental waters could be low. Reconcentration methods have some disadvantages, such as these methods do not produce consistent recovery efficiency for different viruses (Lewis and Metcalf 1988). In a previous study, Centriprep Filter Concentrators provided high and stable recovery yields (74 %) of polioviruses (Haramoto et al. 2004). Another study reported the 35 % recovery of adenovirus 41 through Centricon filters (Wu et al. 2011).",

In real-world scenario, fecal pollution of environmental waters occurs via sewer/septic overflows and surface run off containing fecal matters from various animals. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to obtain recovery efficiency of HAdVs and HPyVs by seeding raw human wastewater that potentially contains naked (genetic materials from defective virions) and intact viral genomes than other studies which seeded intact viruses. From the MST context, there is no need to elute \u201cintact\u201d viruses since the objective is to determine whether the sample contains the signature of human fecal pollution.",
