Not surprisingly most new vaccine candidates against IBV are S1-targeted (Chen et al. 2010; Shil et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2012). Both M and E proteins are critical factors in virion assembly and budding and interactions between the two seem to be the minimum requirements for coronavirus VLP (virus-like particles) formation (Vennema et al. 1996; Masters 2006; Masters et al. 2006). The S protein, however, is was not essential but is incorporated into VLP by interactions with the M protein when present (Ho et al. 2004; Bosch et al. 2005).",

Vaccination with live attenuated or inactivated vaccines is still the most effective way to control IBV. Unfortunately, current vaccines are unable to provide chickens with sufficient protection because of the limitations of traditional vaccines and multiple serotypes of epidemic IBV strains. Consequently, it is essential to find a feasible way for developing a more safe and effective vaccine strategy. Compared with either whole-virus vaccines or recombinant subunit vaccines, VLPs have some prominent advantages to become promising vaccine candidates. As they lack viral genetic material, VLPs are non-infective and thus are safe. Furthermore, VLPs are highly immunogenic due to their structure being similar to authentic viruses with highly repetitive antigenic epitopes (Kushnir et al. 2012). Although there has been some research on coronavirus VLPs, few studies have focused on IBV. Therefore, in this work novel IBV VLPs have been constructed through the co-infection with three recombinant baculoviruses separately expressing M, E and the recombinant S protein containing the S1 subunit fused to the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (TM/CT) of S2 subunit. Additionally, as a vaccine to inoculate specific-pathogen-free chickens, the humoral immunity was evaluated.",

The S1 protein is sufficient to elicit good protective immunity against IBV (Cavanagh 2007; Lin et al. 2012). The incorporation of coronavirus S protein into VLPs is closely related to the interactions between the TM/CT domain of S protein and the CT domain of M protein, (de Haan et al. 1999; Bosch et al. 2005). In addition, the heterologous expression of the full-length S protein is difficult as it is a large protein (180 kDa) with intensive hydrophobicity and is highly glycosylated. Accordingly, a recombinant S protein was constructed with a flexible peptide inserted between the two elements to keep their own structures and functions. Moreover, it would be convenient to replace the S1 subunit with other foreign epitopes or target molecules when exploiting this newly establised VLP as an universal platform.",

However, the former was the more accepted strategy in the current study because co-infection is flexible for further comprehensive studies on the molecular and dynamic mechanism of VLP formation. In addition, the present study demonstrated that IBV VLPs could elicit robust humoral immune responses in specific-pathogen-free chickens that were comparable to the inactivated M41 viruses. More importantly, after booster vaccination, the VLPs even induced slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers than the inactivated M41 viruses (p > 0.05). This was mainly due to the S1 subunit that was carrying most of the neutralizing epitopes, and part of S proteins in M41, had lost their native structures during inactivation. This result further confirmed the incorporation of the modified S protein in VLPs.",
