Despite the frequency, the causes of pneumonia are seldom identified in clinical practice and assessing the etiology of pneumonia is a complex issue since appropriate representative specimens can rarely be obtained and the sensitivity of blood cultures is generally low [2]. However, despite the obstacles to precise definition of the etiology, bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b) have usually been considered as the major pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children [3]. For many years limited attention was given to viral microorganisms involved in CAP, and viral etiologies were largely overlooked and underestimated. Recently the importance of viral etiological agents of pneumonia among pediatric patients has been brought to light, and the view of viral pneumonia has begun to change. Certainly the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza H5N1 and the pandemic swine influenza H1N1 virus have contributed to emphasizing the role of viruses as the cause of life-threatening pneumonia.",

            "text": "If making the clinical and radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia is quite easy, assessing the specific viral etiology is harder, especially in clinical settings. The laboratory diagnosis of lower respiratory infections (LRTIs) poses different challenges [4]. The first challenge is how to obtain a representative sample of lower respiratory tract pathogens. Samples taken directly from the lungs through bronchoalveolar lavage and thoracentesis are ideally the best quality specimens to identify the pathogenic flora because they come from the site of infection and are less frequently contaminated; however, the procedure to obtain such samples is invasive and requires patient collaboration [5, 6]. Because of their poor applicability in clinical practice, especially in children, the tests are reserved for critically ill patients in whom standard treatments have failed. Samples taken from the upper respiratory tract through nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates are certainly less invasive, but the detection of a virus in the nasopharynx might represent a coincidental upper respiratory infection instead of a pneumonia pathogen. However, considering that viral nasopharyngeal carriage in healthy children is considered to be rare, the finding of a respiratory virus in an upper airway sample could be considered as diagnostic for the etiology of LTRI. Certainly the lack of epidemiological studies regarding the prevalence and relevance of nasopharyngeal viral carriage in healthy children of various ages should be taken into consideration; filling this knowledge gap will help clarify the size of this diagnostic issue at a population level.",

Diagnostic tests for viruses have been divided into three main categories: (1) direct examination of the sample (antigen detection, microscopy), (2) indirect tests (cell culture techniques and animal tests), and (3) serology. Usually the preferred method depends on the individual virus. For decades, specific antibody titers and viral culture were the only available tests for identification of a respiratory virus. Viral culture has been considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d, but this procedure has several limitations. Virus cultures are slow (up to 14 days to obtain a negative result) and no preliminary reports are generated. Moreover, the test outcome is closely related to the amount and viability of the viruses in the sample [7].",

The introduction of molecular detection of viral genomes through highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests has improved diagnostic possibilities [8]. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the best-known nucleic acid amplification test platform. PCR and related methods require less time (for both sample preparation and execution), and require less operator skill and training to carry out and provide opportunities for rapid diagnosis. The tests are highly specific, have the highest sensitivity compared to other diagnostic approaches and do not depend upon viral viability. Nevertheless, they have some limitations, such as vulnerability to contamination and inability to distinguish between viruses causing true disease and those which are merely colonized. Moreover, most PCR methods are expensive [9].",

This fact most likely suggests the existence of unknown respiratory pathogens that have not been previously considered. In fact, the second era in the discovery of respiratory viruses did not begin until the early 2000s. Several new respiratory viruses have been found: human metapneumovirus, coronavirus NL63 and HKU1, human bocavirus, and human rhinovirus C and D groups [10]. The contribution of these new viruses will be clarified over the next several years. Recently the discovery of a new enterovirus C-117 strain in a 45-month old girl hospitalized with CAP suggests that the viral impact of CAP is far from being completely defined, and the hypothesis that an unknown virus could be involved in disease pathogenesis is not so remote. In addition, this report suggested that a recombinant origin of the virus reactivated the virus's ability to combine and form new pathogenic variants [11\u2022\u2022].",

In developed countries the burden of pneumonia is large. This disease is responsible for a high rate of hospitalization, high medical expenditure (drugs and medical assistance) and indirect costs (lost work and productivity) [17\u201319]. In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors pneumonia hospitalizations using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. In 2005/2006 the rates of all-cause pneumonia hospitalization per 1,000 children younger than 2 years were 9 % in 2005 and 8 % in 2006 [17]. In the USA alone, the economic burden of CAP has been estimated to be more than $17 billion annually in the adult population and $1,464 per episode in children [18, 19]. The mean cost for patients requiring hospitalization is $12,000 per episode [19]. Indirect costs (lost work and productivity) attributed to pneumonia are significant: parental days of work lost range from 2 days for CAP treated in the ambulatory setting to 4 days for CAP requiring hospitalization [19].",

The exact percentage contribution from each virus depends on the age of the children recruited, and the method used in virus detection (PCR has increased detection of rhinovirus and enteroviruses) [14]. Also, the season influences study results and should not be neglected.

Furthermore, the high prevalence of rhinovirus in hospitalized children with LTRIs has also been documented recently. Rhinovirus RNA has been detected in 45 % of school-age children (5\u201314 years of age) through nasopharyngeal washes [24]. An age-specific distribution has been reported by Esposito et al. [25\u2022]. Rhinovirus was found in 36 % of children aged <1 year, in 27 % of children aged 1\u20133 years and in 26 % of children aged \u22654 years with radiographically confirmed CAP. Rhinovirus type A was the strain most frequently associated with the disease [25\u2022]. These studies have clearly shown that the association between rhinoviruses and LRTIs is significantly more frequent than previously thought, and that rhinovirus CAP is frequent, not only in younger, but also in older children.",

A better definition of the true incidence of these infections is partly derived from recent advances in diagnostic methods [33]. Studies suggested that mixed infections are very common (35 %) with at least one pathogen involved. The majority of mixed infections are mixed viral/bacterial infections [13, 25\u2022]. Indeed, a viral infection that appears either concurrently or immediately before a bacterial infection is able to augment the bacterial colonization into a superinfection. Mixed viral/bacterial infections are especially common in younger children (younger than 2 years) probably as a result of the high frequency of RSV infections and their tendency to induce bacterial coinfections.",
