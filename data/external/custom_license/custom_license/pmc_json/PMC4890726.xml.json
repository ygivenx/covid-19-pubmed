Vaccines operate by triggering immune response in an individual. It has been shown that under some circumstances immunocompetent individuals can protect themselves against primary tumor development.1 It is also established that while a healthy immune system can act as a tumor suppressor, in other cases it might facilitate tumor progression.2 Nevertheless, given the wide variety of viral cancers and progression of the disease, using the immune system to prevent cancer through antiviral vaccines could be a reasonable procedure. Some viral cancers such as those caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B viruses have been effectively prevented through such techniques.",

Over 170 types of HPVs have been identified.3 The large variety of HPV types is believed to have evolved from the large-scale migration of human populations and appears to follow their major migration patterns.4 The virus is generally spread by sexual activities and can lie dormant for years before symptoms develop. In the majority of cases, the virus causes warts on the body, but a small fraction of the infections develops into cancers. It is estimated that over 27,000 people develop HPV cancers every year in the USA, usually detected at a fairly late stage5; an analysis of all cancers worldwide in 2002 revealed that of about 1.9 million cases of cancer attributable to infections, around 561,200 were due to HPVs,6 with an incidence ratio of 2:7 between numbers in the developed and developing countries.",

One study conducted among a large sample of patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell cervical cancers8 determined 15 HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82) classified as high risk, three (26, 53, and 66) as probable high risk, and several others (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81) as low-risk types. Some HPV types also cause oropharyngeal cancers: 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers are attributable to HPV16,8,9 and HPV6 and HPV11 have also been determined to cause such cancers10; these findings are important since HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers (OPSCCs) are reported to have doubled in the period 1984\u20132004, whereas HPV-negative OPSCCs decreased by 50% while overall 18% of oral and oropharyngeal cancers worldwide are HPV associated.10 Other types of HPVs are known to cause various ailments: HPV6 and 11 cause recurrent respiratory papillomatosis,11 HPV types 2, 27, and 57 can cause skin warts, while HPV 1, 2, 27, and 63 were found on clinically normal skin.12 Moreover, the proportion of various types of HPV varies across countries and continents, and thus affects the outcome of standard preventive medications.8",

There are basically six early proteins and two late proteins, namely, L1 and L2, which are outer capsid proteins, at approximately 95:5 ratio. The L1 proteins form a pentameric assembly on the virion shell, the individual proteins being held together by disulfide bonds; these proteins form the basis for vaccines against papillomaviruses. Unlike the RNA viruses that lack proofreading mechanism, DNA viruses are capable of correcting replication errors and are much more stable to mutational changes than their RNA counterparts. Thus, DNA viruses are more conserved, and vaccines are more effective over a longer period.",

This situation has been mitigated to some extent by the launch of a 9-valent Gardasil vaccine (9vHPV) that protects against HPV types covered by the older quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV6, 11, 16, and 18) and five additional oncogenic types (HPV31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).14 A controlled test determined that the 9vHPV was noninferior to the previous quadrivalent HPV in preventing infections and generating antibodies against the particular types of HPVs it was designed against, but was not effective against other types.14",

They do not carry any genetic material, thus providing a safer alternative to live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines. The first VLP vaccine license was granted in 1986 for the hepatitis B virus by the US Food and Drug Administration,15 and VLP vaccines for two more viruses, such as HPV and hepatitis E, have secured licenses. The fact that over the last 30 years only three such vaccines have been marketed while many new and re-emerging viruses have been recognized indicates how difficult and expensive it must be to develop VLP vaccines. Although the VLP vaccines have proved very effective in practice, they are generally beyond the reach of patients in developing countries, and also the nature of the VLP vaccine can inhibit attempts at personalized medication, which may be required in certain population groups.16",

A more focused approach is to precisely locate the epitope regions within these antigens and utilize them to elicit the immune response.18 The recent advancements in the technological and bioinformatics fields enable computer-based approaches for this purpose. Synthetic peptide vaccines, which are just beginning to draw wide interest at this time, are easier to construct, the bioinformatics approaches lead to shorter development times, such vaccines can be tailor-made to suit individual applications and avoid autoimmune threats, and overall are cheaper to design and market.18 It is interesting to note that the US National Institute of Health projects portal, ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), reports, as of mid April 2016, 562 projects under trial for peptide vaccines, 106 projects for VLP vaccines, and 74 projects for synthetic peptide vaccines.",

There is also the advantage with peptide vaccines that, in theory, multivalent vaccines can be more easily designed and marketed at more affordable prices than multivalent VLP vaccines against a wide range of HPV types.

Now, given the strict type specificity of the neutralizing antibodies and the mutations in aa composition, deletions, and insertions that may take place,27 this implies that in specific cases neutralizing antibodies raised against one strain may not be viable against another strain, although the success of the current HPV vaccines show that this may happen seldom.

At each stage, the peptide graph radius, pR, is computed and stored (see Refs. 19 and 20 for details). This is then repeated for each protein sequence of the selected group of sequences and then the entire lot is scanned at each mapped aa position to determine the number of different pR-values, among all the sequences. Since each pR value represents a particular peptide sequence, the number of values of the pR at each aa position map out a protein variety profile of the aas covered by the sliding window. The minima of the profile indicate regions where variety, and by inference changes in aas, are relatively least, indicating most conserved regions.",

The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) shows explicitly that the strains of each type belong to individual groups and the different types form separate clades: the HPV18 and 45 belong to one clade and HPV16, 33, and 35 to another. The 2D graphs (Fig. 2) also show at a glance the close similarities between HPV16, 33, and 35, and also between HPV18 and 45, and indications of where the two groups are different. Thus, our earlier experience could not be repeated here, which has to be considered as intertype differences. However, there can be large differences within a type too: eg, HPV type 16 from Iran (KM058666) and African type 2 variant (AF472509) are quite different, but because these are dsDNA types of viruses, we expect they will be regionally, ie, within the population groups, stable.

These numbers were then smoothed over a range of 12 positions, and a running average computed over the complete sequence. Next, ASA profiles were determined for several samples of the selected HPV types using the SABLE server, which has been found to be quite reliable. Taking an average of the solvent accessibility numbers determined residuewise for each sequence from SABLE, and then taking the running average of 12 aa, we get a smoothed out solvent accessibility profile whose peaks indicate highest solvent accessibility around that residue position. By our logic, the regions where the lowest variety numbers for aa stretches match with the highest values of the ASA profiles represent potentially the best situated highly conserved surface accessible peptide segments in the protein sequence.

Step three of our search for vaccine target regions is to verify the surface accessibility of the identified regions through protein crystal structure. For this exercise, we used 2R5H for HPV16, 2R5I for HPV18, 2R5J for HPV35, and 2R5K for HPV11 available from the Protein Data Bank and individually checked for each of the regions in space-fill models; since no structure was available for HPV33 and HPV45, detailed comparison had to be omitted here. Figures 4\u20137 (HPV16, HPV18, HPV35, and HPV11, respectively) give snapshots of the identified peptides highlighted in yellow in one of the proteins of the pentameric structure of the capsid assembly. In the case of region 1 of HPV16, which was surface accessible for a solitary HPV protein, this peptide stretch is almost entirely covered by the adjacent protein and, therefore, has to be rejected as a vaccine target candidate. Region 2 was found to be entirely viable. In the case of regions 3 and 4, the original 12 aa stretches were found to be surface situated, but 5 aas at the 5\u2032-end were found to be covered by the neighboring residues, ie, even if these extended segments belong to a group of conserved residues, the parts beyond the original 12aa stretches are not viable as candidate vaccine targets. Interestingly, the two regions, 3 and 4, are on two sides of the protein, but both are surface accessible. These segments that are not available for consideration as potential vaccine targets are marked in red in Table 2. Region 5 listed in the table could not be tested in a similar manner due to the nonavailability of these stretches in the protein crystals.",

Table 3 shows that all the regions we had identified passed the MHC II test, although in some instances one or the other allele gave results that were just outside the permissible range for generating immune response. However, none of the regions of any of the three HPV types failed in both alleles. Likewise, we tested for B-cell humoral response through the ABCpred server, which has been known to predict epitope regions for B-cell response with about 66% accuracy. As can be seen from the results extracted in Table 4, we find that in this instance all our regions passed this test with high acceptability ranks, except for region 4 for HPV35 whose score was outside the critical range.",

Our exercise through bioinformatics means has yielded a set of peptides for each HPV type analyzed, which a priori appears to provide a feasible alternative. Because of the nature of the viral coat proteins, the peptides proposed in this paper may not provide the high level of efficiency that the VLP vaccines can provide, but with suitable adjuvants to enhance the neutralizing antibody production and appropriate mix of wider range of HPV types, it is hoped that the preventive actions can be augmented and a substantial fraction of the population may be afforded some relief at lower cost. For this to happen, however, it is necessary to conduct wet laboratory experiments to test the efficacy of the results of bioinformatics studies like this. Given the wide spread of papillomavirus-induced cervical, genital, and other cancers and the sufferings these cause, and the large variety of the virus, such preparations are to be strongly advocated.",
