In order to simulate the viruses for bioaerosol study, bacteriophages have been typically used as surrogates for pathogenic viruses (Dubovi and Akers 1970; Harstad 1965; Hatch and Warren 1969).",

Since the impingers are widely used, the damage of microorganism caused by the violent motion in the liquid was also characterized. Willeke has proved that the bubbling in the impinger partially contributed to bacterial injury (Willeke et al. 1995). Agranovski et al. (2004) has investigated the inactivation rate of four viruses in the bubbling process by using distilled water and Hank\u2019s solution with appropriate additives. It was concluded that the survival rates of the influenza, measles, and mumps viruses were increased compared to bubbling through the sterile water. Few researchers, however, focused on the collecting medium for bacteriophages and specialized in reflecting effect of bubbling aeration on the viability of bacteriophages quantitatively and statistically.",

Because of extensive evaporation of the collection fluid during operation, which reached 50% of the initial impinger volume per hour at a relative humidity of 30% (Terzieva et al. 1996), all plaque count results were corrected by a liquid evaporation factor, which was calculated by use of Eq. 2.",

The impingers were operated at a flow rate of 7.0 l/min which was controlled by a flow meter. The bubbling process lasted for 30 min, and final volume of sampling solution was determined. Each group was repeated three times. At least three replicate measurements of the initial and final bacteriophage concentrations in the collection fluid were taken for each impinger. For all experiments, the air temperature was maintained between 20 and 23\u00b0C, and the relative humidity in cabinet was between 40 and 50%. The initial and final viable bacteriophage counts were determined by double-layer agar technique. Survival percentage correction was utilized for evaluation of bacteriophage resistance or endurance in bubbling aeration, which was calculated by use of Eq. 1.",

Research indicates that violent bubbling may beget inactivation of the viable agents and lose a considerable amount of the collection fluid (Willeke et al. 1995; Lin et al. 1997; Agranovski et al. 2004). Olive oil was added in sampling solution as antifoam to impede foam formation to reduce virus stress during bubbling. In order to investigate whether oil can affect the plaque formation of five targeted bacteriophages, we carried out the previously described experiments. The results indicated that olive oil did not seem to influence phage PFU counts as well as the morphology and size of plaque in static state in the very short term. This result was in correspondence with our previous observation that a very small amount of oil in suspension would not influence the non-enveloped and non-lipid-coated phages on formation of plaque. Phage SM701, SM702, and EcP1 belong to Caudovirales, and PhiX174 and F2 belong to Microviridae and Leviviridae, respectively. It has been known that phages of Caudovirales (including three families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae), Microviridae, and Leviviridae contain no lipids (Ackermann 1999). We consider this might well elucidate earlier results. For phage EcP1, PhiX174, and F2, results of 30-min bubbling aeration indicated whether olive oil was added or not, corrected survival percentage were not significantly different (ANOVA, P > 0.05), but the index was significantly higher in SM and DW than in PBS for EcP1 and higher in SM than in DW and PBS for PhiX174 (ANOVA, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between sampling solutions, no matter whether or not adding olive oil as antifoam for phage F2 (ANOVA, P > 0.05). The most complex situation occurred in phage SM702, of which corrected survival percentage in SM was significantly higher than in PBS and DW, no matter whether or not adding oil. Adding olive oil into DW or PBS except for SM might reduce the survival percentage correction of bacteriophage SM702. Enveloped or lipid-coated phages were absent in present study, but we might made an inference that those kinds of phages might be influenced by olive oil. However, this inference needs to be proved further by experiments.",

Theoretically, it is impossible for survivable viruses\u2019 raise with bubbling. However, the concentration of survival agents might increase when the evaporation of sampling solution surpasses the decay of viruses.
