            "text": "Since the time-scale of most biological invasions is so short, population genetic inference based upon the neutral theory of molecular evolution is typically limited (at least for eukaryotes) to questions such as determining the geographic origin of the invasion, testing for bottlenecks, and testing for hybridization with native species (Fitzpatrick et al. 2012). Viruses and pathogenic microbes (e.g. bacteria, phytoplasmas, and some fungi) with high mutation rates and short generation times may be exceptions to this rule and indeed genetic data are increasingly being used to trace disease transmission pathways. For example, the high-rate of nucleotide sequence evolution of RNA viruses permits detailed phylogenetic reconstructions of disease transmission pathways even within the short time-scale of epidemics. Disease outbreaks studied in this way include foot-and-mouth disease (Cottam et al. 2008), HIV (Leitner and Albert 1999), hepatitis C (Bracho et al. 2005), Ebolavirus (Walsh et al. 2005) and SARS coronavirus (Liu et al. 2005). Recent analytical advances are also beginning to permit the combining of genetic data with traditional epidemiological data (e.g. the tracing of contacts, timing and spatial proximity of infections). Within the field of disease ecology, the use of genetic data and their integration with information regarding the timing, spread and incidence of disease outbreaks has been more limited. This may be because of differences in specialization between field pathologists and molecular biologists (Milgroom and Peever 2003), because of greater difficulty in obtaining detailed epidemiological data, and because basic knowledge about the population biology and genetics of many economically important pathogens is lacking (Fletcher et al. 2006; Goss et al. 2009b). Although newly emergent plant pathogens are often typified by reduced genetic diversity due to strong bottlenecks experienced during intercontinental transport combined with the strictly clonal reproduction occurring when a single mating type is introduced (Engelbrecht et al. 2004; Garbelotto 2008; Gonthier and Garbelotto 2011), strong directional selection processes may occur as introduced pathogens colonize new habitats (Goss et al. 2009b; Gr\u00fcnwald and Goss 2011; Paoletti et al. 2006). Consequently, these pathogens experience local diversification that may be tracked at highly-variable neutral markers as novel genotypes emerge. This pattern of clonal evolution permits the identification of particular genotypes, which may be traced to infer the origins, relationships and transmission routes of epidemics (Cummings and Relman 2002; Goss et al. 2009b). Such \u201cmicrobial forensics\u201d is made possible by the increasingly easy development of polymorphic markers and by the advent of coalescent algorithms that permit detailed assessment of population genetic parameters (e.g. effective population size and migration rates) over time (Gr\u00fcnwald and Goss 2011). The power of these approaches can be enhanced by the integration of historical and epidemiological data (Milgroom and Peever 2003).",

P. ramorum has reached epidemic levels in the native coastal forests of California and southern Oregon (Rizzo and Garbelotto 2003), causing lethal trunk lesions on tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflora), coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), Californian black oak (Quercus kelloggii), and possibly Canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis). The pathogen also causes a more progressive die-back called \u201cramorum blight\u201d in over 100 species of wild and ornamental plants (Davidson et al. 2003; Gr\u00fcnwald et al. 2008; Rizzo et al. 2005). SOD symptoms were first noticed in 1994\u20131995 in Californian oaks and tanoaks (Garbelotto et al. 2001; Rizzo et al. 2002) and in Rhododendron and Viburnum plants in European nurseries (Werres et al. 2001). Subsequent studies showed that the two most relevant infectious substrates in California forests are provided by bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) and tanoak leaves, while oaks and tanoak boles appear to be non-infectious (Reviewed in Rizzo and Garbelotto 2003).",

NA1 is also responsible for the natural infestation in North American forests, while EU1, NA1, and NA2 genotypes have all been isolated only from nurseries in North America (Goss et al. 2011; Hansen et al. 2003; Ivors et al. 2004). Forest infestations are present in a single county in Southern Oregon (Curry County), and in 14 contiguous counties in California from Humboldt to Monterey, spanning over 700 km of mostly coastal habitat (Fig. 1; also see www.sodmap.org). The EU2 lineage has been recently discovered in formal gardens of Northern Ireland and Northwestern Great Britain (Van Poucke et al. 2012). Indeed, the four lineages probably originated from geographically isolated populations that have been clonally reproducing for almost 200,000 years and have a reduced ability to reproduce sexually (Goss et al. 2009b).\n",

Human mediated transport through the movement of infected ornamental plants among nurseries across North America and between Europe and North America is clear (Goss et al. 2009b, 2011). At a more local scale, the presence of genetically identical forest populations at great distances, a scenario that can only be justified by human-mediated transport of the pathogen, has also been explained as the result of the concurrent movement of infected ornamental plants in different locations (Mascheretti et al. 2008, 2009). Despite the contributions of these previous studies to our understanding of the mode of spread and of the epidemic history of P. ramorum in California wild lands, many important aspects remain unresolved. First, the original coalescent inferences of migration routes within California were tentative and often inconclusive because not all infested localities were sampled, and all genetically indistinguishable populations were pooled into \u201cmeta-populations\u201d regardless of location (Mascheretti et al. 2009). Second, no robust method existed for placing infestations caused by singleton genotypes within the genetic reconstruction of the epidemic. Because new wild infestations of most diseases are often characterized by the presence of a single genotype, this was a significant shortcoming. Third, while 3 genotypes were suggested as being the original founders of all forest infestations in California, that inference was based only on their relative dominance and positioning within a minimum-spanning network (Mascheretti et al. 2008, 2009). Previous analyses did not include historical isolates (i.e. collected before 2005) to corroborate such hypothesis, thus ignoring the possibility that current genotypes may be the result of rapid adaptation and may not represent the original founder individuals.",

We extend our approaches to include the positioning of individual genotypes into a robust backbone population tree, and, finally, we objectively integrate historical data (e.g. infestation age) without assumptions of directionality and without subjectively positioning any population as basal or derived, into genealogical coalescence-based migration model choice. To shed light on the microevolutionary history of the pathogen in its new California range, we use historical isolates collected in the first 5 years following the discovery of P. ramorum in California to corroborate the likely number of founder individuals.",

The genetic differentiation (\u03a6\nST) among all 62 pairs of P. ramorum forest and nursery populations was evaluated as the between population proportion of molecular variance from amova (Excoffier et al. 1992), implemented by arlequin v.3.5 (Excoffier et al. 2005). The Bruvo distance (Bruvo et al. 2004) among each pair of unique MGs was used as the evolutionary distance and given to arlequin as an external file, and statistical significance evaluated by permuting individuals across locations 10,000 times. Populations were recursively clustered by pooling the pair of populations or clusters that yielded the minimum non-significant \u03a6\nST at each round until no further insignificant clustering (i.e. minimum \u03a6\nST\nP > 0.05) was possible (Roewer et al. 2005; Mascheretti et al. 2008, 2009). All populations with fewer than five isolates were excluded from this analysis to minimize the influence of stochastic sampling error on the greedy clustering algorithm (singleton samples were analyzed separately: see Materials and Methods: Statistical Analysis\u2014Singletons; below). The algorithm was supervised by applying it only to populations from within the same county. Following the county-based clustering, the algorithm was continued to completion, permitting collapses among counties. Additionally, we re-ran the algorithm without supervision. The results were evaluated based upon knowledge from previous analyses of P. ramorum populations (Mascheretti et al. 2008, 2009) and by subjecting the final set of populations from each run (by county, overall, and unsupervised) to a traditional hierarchical amova\u2014evaluating the \u03a6\nCT value, which provides an unbiased way to judge population groupings i.e. by maximizing the \u2018among group\u2019 variation (whilst minimizing the \u2018within group variation\u2019) (Dupanloup et al. 2002). Examination of \u03a6\nCT the values indicated that the supervised clustering (by county \u03a6\nCT = 0.3083, P < 0.001) was superior to the unsupervised algorithm (unsupervised \u03a6\nCT = 0.2879, P < 0.001), but that allowing collapsing among counties offered little further improvement (overall \u03a6\nCT = 0.3099, P < 0.001). Since collapses among counties may reflect recent shared source populations rather than direct migration between these populations, the \u2018by county\u2019 set of populations was conservatively chosen as the basis for subsequent analyses.",

Migrate-n uses coalescent simulations of genetic data to infer effective population sizes and past migration rates among n populations. It assumes that the migration matrix model is asymmetric and that population sizes need not be equal, it is therefore a very flexible and powerful tool. However, our previous use of this approach suffered from three significant limitations. First, the number of parameters to be estimated increases dramatically with the number of populations: limiting accuracy and increasing computational complexity. Second, samples were probably over-collapsed such that some populations with quite different histories were merged, potentially confounding the analysis. Third, it is very unlikely that most P. ramorum populations approach genetic equilibrium, violating the assumptions of migrate-n and rendering estimates of M unreliable. Here, rather than estimate M, we used the output ln marginal likelihoods (ln(ml)) to choose among different migration models (Beerli and Palczewski 2010) and reconstruct the minimal, most probable, set of unidirectional migration routes among the new and highly-resolved population dataset. Twenty-nine populations (n \u2265 5) yield a computationally intractable number of possible models and we therefore took a stepwise approach to make the analysis computationally tractable as described in Croucher et al. (2012) (Details in supplemental data). The number of possible models was limited by incorporating \u201cepidemiological\u201d data (known age of infestation\u20146 categories: 20+ years; 15\u201320 years; 10\u201315 years; <10 years; <8 years; <5 years)\u2014disallowing models that included migration from a younger to an older population.",

In a fully clonal organism, such P. ramorum, the genotypes at the loci within an individual will not be independent, violating the assumptions of structure. Since there is only a single coalescent tree for a clonal organism, any clusters returned by structure will simply reflect the major clades of that tree and will therefore describe the structure of the variation present in the species rather than defining a population structure. Additionally, Structure has previously been applied to clonally reproducing organisms including P. ramorum (Goss et al. 2009b). Our aim was to ascertain whether there was any clear sub-structure in the historical patterns of clonal variation present in California, in particular in terms of whether the outbreak may have resulted from one or more introduced MGs.

Ln Pr(X|k) increased with each value of k and did not have a clear maximum.

A secondary maximum \u0394K was observed at k = 4, and this value was therefore examined as an indicator of possible sub-structure in the data.

As such, a few populations moved notably between these two depictions of genetic relatedness (arrows between Fig. 2a, b). In general these were populations with small sample sizes and were more logically grouped based upon GCD (Fig. 2b), e.g. Humboldt 4 (n = 3) groups with the other young Humboldt populations in Cluster 2; East Bay 2 (n = 6) moves to cluster 1 in which East Bay 1 also occurs; SO1 (n = 5) joins other old populations in cluster 1.

Results for all MGs are given in Supplemental Table 2. The four most common MGs each fall centrally into one of these clusters and alleles at two SSR loci (MS43a and b) within each of these MGs appear to define the clusters. MG46/96 (MG96 was merged with MG46 because of missing/null alleles at MS18) (n = 123) is at the heart of cluster 1, MG42 (n = 134) at the heart of cluster 3, and MG38 (n = 95) at the heart of cluster 4. These MGs are identical except at locus MS43b where MG46/96 carries genotype 93/93 (cluster 1), MG42 has genotype 92/92 (cluster 3), and MG38 has genotype 91/91 (cluster 4). The fact that cluster 1 is basal in the NJ-tree (Fig. 2b) therefore suggests that MG46/96 could represent the original founding genotype in the Californian P. ramorum infestation. MGs 42, 46/96 and 38 correspond precisely to the three MGs originally suggested as being possibly ancestral by (Mascheretti et al. 2008). Cluster 2 is defined by MG24 (n = 60), which like MG42 has genotype 92/92 at MS43b, but differs from MG42 by having genotype 69/69 at MS43a (instead of 70/70 for MG42). The one-step differences between these MGs, together with their commonness, supports the notion that these genotypes are early founders of the SOD epidemic and form the base of the four clades corresponding to the genetic clusters identified by structure. The putative evolutionary relationship between these four MGs is depicted as a simple mutational network in Fig. 3. According to the NJ analyses (Fig. 2), cluster 2 is the youngest and, examination of the MSN (supplemental), suggests that it may have at least two origins as indicated by the fact that some MGs are not directly connected to others in the network. This is supported by the values of clonal genotype diversity (R) and Nei\u2019s genetic diversity (D) (Fig. 3), with R for cluster 2 being twice that of cluster 3, and D also being markedly higher. Cluster 4 also showed a much less marked increase in these values.\n",

The MGs on the MSN were therefore annotated as \u201chistorical\u201d if a historical isolate representing that MG was present in the data. The number of individuals representing an historical MG was then calculated and plotted (Fig. 4). This plot demonstrates that the majority of individuals are represented by a few common MGs, and that the majority of individuals also represent historical MGs (n = 582; 73 %), in other words the most common MGs are also historical. As expected, MGs 42, 46/96, 38, and 24 corresponded to historical isolates. To test this further, we asked if one-step neighbors of MGs 42, 46/96, 38 and 24 were more likely to be historical than MGs that were two or more steps removed (Fig. 4, inset). The result was highly significant (\u03c72 = 45.96; P < < 0.0001) with one-step neighbors of the three common MGs being more than ten-times as likely to be historical than MGs two or more steps away (Odds ratio = 10.83; 95 % CI 4.82\u201324.33). It should also be noted that non-historical singleton MGs were excluded from the network for clarity (see supplemental information), meaning that the number of non-historical MGs that were more than two-steps away from the most common MGs is in fact larger than reported here. Thus, the results of this analysis are conservative.\n",

Secondary sources or stepping stones for the pathogen appear to be all located in areas with significant forest cover and are all characterized by cooler climate (several sites in Marin and Sonoma counties), while old infestation in more urban areas characterized by warmer climate (e.g. in the San Francisco East Bay and in the Napa Valley) were rather inconsequential for the further spread of the pathogen (Fig. 1). The analysis also revealed that in several cases, multiple infestation routes involving different sources have infested the same counties, proving that many counties were each infested more than once during the brief history of the disease. The vast majority of linkages between sites uncovered by the coalescence analysis are at distances of tens of km, the implications of this finding are discussed below.",

Thus, the generation of more than 200 genotypes from 1 to 4 original founders over approximately 25 years implies populations of extremely large sizes: this is not surprising given the extent of establishment of the pathogen in California and the large numbers of mitospores it produces on the leaves of infectious hosts (Reviewed in Garbelotto and Hayden 2012). While it is true that the number of polymorphic repeats in SSR loci of individuals from California forests appears to reflect a stepwise mutation process, and only includes incremental or small jumps in the number of repeats as confirmed by published sequencing results (Ivors et al. 2006, Prospero et al. 2004, 2007, 2009; Vercauteren et al. 2010), the pattern of homozygosity at many of the loci is surprising. Nonetheless, similar patterns of \u201closs of heterozygosity\u201d (LOH) appear to be a common feature of the genetics of Phytopthoras and LOH as a result of very frequent mitotic crossing has been demonstrated to be the norm in clonal isolates of P. capsici (Lamour et al. 2012) and P. cinnamoni (Dobrowolski et al. 2003). Indeed, it has been suggested that clonality may be advantageous to invasive organisms and that mitotic recombination may act to purge clonal organisms of recessive deleterious mutations (as meiosis can for sexual organisms in stable environments) (Shaw 1983; Dobrowolski et al. 2003). In any case, it is unlikely that binding site mutations have resulted in consistent hemizygous PCR amplification at so many loci and across numerous studies.",

            "text": "Genetic relationships among populations were examined by drawing NJ-trees. To ensure the robustness of this analysis we used a two-tiered approach. First, the shortest possible NJ-tree with populations of sample size \u22655 was constructed. Second, this was used as a backbone constraint to which the remaining populations were appended. This yielded a depiction of the genetic relationships among the populations (Fig. 2a) mirroring the known age of the infestations, with the oldest populations near the root (Nursery-Santa Cruz 1) and the youngest infestations furthest from the root. It is important to remember that the NJ-tree does not represent a phylogeny, branches do not represent splitting events, but merely genetic distances. The level of structure present in the NJ-tree reflects the evolutionary process by which the MGs have evolved. Many infestations probably experience a strong founder effect, with only one or a few MGs being introduced and very little subsequent gene flow into or out of the populations. Although the MGs within each population subsequently diversify by mutation and somatic recombination, most new MGs remain rare (Mascheretti et al. 2009), and many are eliminated seasonally as populations crash during the drier summer months (Prospero et al. 2007). This, combined with the fact that P. ramorum currently reproduces in an exclusively clonal manner (Ivors et al. 2006; Goss et al. 2009a), means that the historical signal of colonization remains intact and the NJ-tree not only reflects the genetic similarity among the populations, but also the relative timing of the colonization events. In this study, it was possible to define four very closely related core genotypes that have generated four genetic clusters: MG46/96: cluster 1; MG42: cluster 3; MG38: cluster 4; and MG24: cluster 2. These clusters map to the known age since infestation and they likely represent clades of the branching process that created the current pattern of genetic variation. Indeed, when the relationships among the populations were plotted as an NJ-tree using a distance measure (GCD) based-upon cluster membership, the tree even more closely mirrored infestation age than the Bruvo-based tree (Fig. 2b). Hence, we can deduce that MG46/96 represents the most ancestral of all these MGs. We conclude that despite limited information content of the markers used, the biology of P. ramorum allows for a solid reconstruction of the actual order of events during the epidemic.",

This is further supported by the analysis of historical isolates that were collected in the early days (i.e. between 2001 and 2004) of the research on SOD. These historical isolates include many of the most numerous MGs, with the four common MGs and their immediate one-step neighbors in the MSN accounting for 99 % of individuals within historical MGs and only for 68 % of those within non-historical MGs. Hence, the most common genotypes are the oldest and consequently MG 46/96, and subsequently MGs 42, 38 and 24, may indeed represent the original progenitors of the SOD epidemic. Interestingly, each area is dominated by a single cluster, suggesting founder individuals may maintain an advantage over other isolates, whether subsequently introduced or locally generated.",

We attempted to do this using Migrate-n to choose among migration models on the basis of their ln marginal likelihood, incorporating the known time since infestation into the model. The analysis of genetic data in concert with epidemiological data is something that has rarely been done in disease ecology (Milgroom and Peever 2003). We assumed that each population has only a single source population and this may be mostly be true given the limited natural dispersal abilities of P. ramorum (Mascheretti et al. 2008, 2009). However, especially for some of the oldest infestations occurring before the SOD epidemic was recognized, multiple transmissions among sites may have occurred. Additionally, the reconstruction must be interpreted cautiously because it is subject to stochastic sampling errors, and because the algorithm may be mislead by populations that are by chance genetically similar (because they share founders with similar genotypes) but actually derive not from each other but from parental or grand-parental populations. Finally, populations that appear to derive from the same parent may actually derive from one another. Nonetheless, this reconstruction not only corroborates many expectations and observations from earlier migration-based analyses, but also provides some remarkable new insights.",

This is reasonable due to the current enormous size of wild populations compared to nursery populations. However, our ability to place individual genotypes on the robust NJ tree (Fig. 2a) represents a major advancement in our ability to determine the source of new small infestations. This approach indicated that several minor infestations have been caused by isolates in cluster 1 and are likely to have originated, perhaps as recently as 2005\u20132006 in the case of the San Francisco Presidio, from infected ornamental plants. It should be noted that in general these infestations are minor because they occurred in areas that are not particularly suitable to outbreaks due to the lack of infectious hosts (Prunedale, Monterey County), because in an urban environment (Presidio of San Francisco), or because in areas with highly fragmented habitat characterized by warmer climate (East San Francisco Bay). However, the overall limited representation of these nursery-linked introductions may mask a constant flux of genotypes from ornamental plantings to wild-lands.",

(2008). Although this conclusion requires further supporting evidence, the limited dispersal of the basal cluster 1 relative to the other clusters is suggestive of adaptation in the other three derived clusters. Notwithstanding a possible reduced fitness of nursery genotypes (e.g. cluster 1 of the NA1 lineage) in forests, California nurseries are known to harbor three genetically and phenotypically distinct lineages of the pathogen (Brasier 2003; Elliot et al. 2009; Ivors et al. 2006), and a low level of migration between ornamental plantings and wild-lands could lead to the introduction of the NA2 and EU1 lineages to California forests, where currently only the NA1 lineage is present. The introduction of the EU1 lineage (A1 mating type\u2014NA1 and NA2 have the A2 mating type, reviewed in Gr\u00fcnwald et al. 2012) could permit sexual reproduction and the production of hardy sexual reproductive structures (oospores) that may increase the survival of the pathogen, and allow faster adaptation of the pathogen to new habitats and hosts.",

The infestation was originally discovered by baiting the pathogen 20 miles downstream (Humboldt 5) in Redwood Creek, a waterway that crosses the aerial infestation. Genotyping showed the genotypes in the stream were the same found in the terrestrial infestation 20 miles upstream, and that enough time had lapsed since the introduction of the pathogen for several genotypes to have been generated locally in such site (Supplemental Table S1). These findings underlined the importance of genetic data to: (a) link baiting results from waterways with a putative terrestrial source; (b) date an infestation, highlighting that even if recently discovered, some infestations may be older and simply unnoticed in spite of significant surveying efforts; (c) determine that the likely source of this recently discovered outbreak was neither current nursery genotypes, nor the neighboring Oregon infestation, but the infestation appeared rather to have been started from the same source that started the Southern Humboldt infestation. Given the long distance between Sonoma and Humboldt, the most likely pathway had to be that of the movement of infected ornamental plants, a pathway that has been shown (Goss et al. 2011, b; Mascheretti et al. 2008, 2009; this study) to be effective at the long distance movement of P. ramorum. Although possibly coincidental, the source of the Humboldt infestation (Sonoma 4) includes not only a large wild infestation, but also a nursery that although not sampled is adjacent (<3 km) to some of our sampling transects.",

It appears that all genotypes belonging to cluster 1 have a direct relationship with the ornamental trade, thus all infestations with cluster 1 genotypes (8 of 18 supported linkages between populations too distant for natural spread shown as dashed lines originating from cluster 1 populations in Fig. 5), or those immediately derived from cluster 1 (7 additional linkages in Fig. 5) in the coalescent analysis, can be reputed to be related to the movement of infected ornamental plants. Thus, in total, the pathogen appears to have been introduced 8\u201314 times in different California locations through the movement of infected ornamental plants. Several introductions may explain both the high success of establishment of the pathogen and the presence of four distinct clusters of populations.",

Thus, limiting the population size in individual areas, in addition to blocking pathways of spread, may be of paramount importance in slowing the spread of a disease such as SOD. This observation may be important, since favorable weather conditions in 2010\u20132012 (www.sodmap.org) have resulted in a clear local expansion of the disease in many locations, potentially generating new sources for future long-distance dispersal.",

In particular, the coalescent analysis performed in this study allows the reconstruction of spread pathways within Marin and Santa Cruz counties (solid lines in Fig. 5). Although the coalescent analyses ignored relationships among genetically undistinguishable populations if within the same county, age of the infestation can be used to determine spread pathways among these. For instance, in the Big Sur region the oldest infestations are centrally located (MO1, MO6) with younger infestations present both North (MO5, MO3) and South (MO4, MO2) of what is obviously the first local infestation for the entire region, responsible for the spread of the pathogen both North- and South-ward.",

This has been possible because of the almost complete sampling coverage of infestations in California, and because of the limited natural dispersal and of the exclusively clonal reproductive biology of P. ramorum. With the current study, we are now able to demonstrate that 1\u20134 genotypes (most likely 1, rapidly diverged into 4) were originally introduced in California, that most counties were infested more than once by different founders, and that, while new recent outbreaks are linked mostly to pathogen movement (both natural and human-mediated) from large wild infestations, in some cases the source can still be identified in infected ornamental plants. Based on the different incidence of the four clusters, we can also suggest that some genotypes may be more adapted to cause forest outbreaks than others. Further, the identification of several old infestations in the East Bay, Mendocino, and Napa counties that did not develop into epidemic outbreaks like other equally-aged or even younger infestations (Big Sur, Southern Humboldt, West Marin) suggests the presence of strong and different local ecological constraints to disease progression.",

We believe that the approaches used here may not only be computationally less intensive but may also be applicable to other introduced organisms with reproductive and dispersal strategies comparable to P. ramorum. Although we are aware that the intensive sampling described here may not always be feasible, we would like to note that including field epidemiological information to guide the computational algorithms used to infer relationships among populations was key to the success of the analysis and should become a common practice when attempting to reconstruct the invasion history of an exotic organism.",
