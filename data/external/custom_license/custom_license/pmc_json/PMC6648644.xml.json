Meanwhile, the ion migration time would no longer reflect\nthe ion radius difference in the back end. Therefore, to improve measurement\naccuracy, the analysis condition should be controlled so that the\nrange of ion migration time is located at the \u201cturning point\u201d\nof the characteristic curve. As shown in Figure 2, a higher electric field would typically\nshift the characteristic curve up, while a higher driving pressure\n(or liquid flow rate) could shift the characteristic curve down. While\nelectric field and liquid flow rate are the two most important parameters,\ncapillary length, charge state of ions, and buffer viscosity also\nhave impacts on ion migration time. Details about these effects could\nbe found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).",

The peptide angiotensin I was used to demonstrate this\nprocess. As plotted in Figure 3a, ion migration time (t) of angiotensin\nI could be obtained by performing MCE analysis, while the neutral\nmarker peak in front was used to calibrate the liquid flow rate. Repeated\nexperiments (Figure 3a) show that MCE has great repeatability, and a CV (coefficient of\nvariance) value of 0.385% was achieved for angiotensin I. The peak\nwidth and tailing effect of angiotensin I could be attributed to two\nfactors: (1) To achieve precise control of the liquid flow rate, laminar\nflow was used in MCE, and the EOF was minimized. (2) To make sure\nthe MCE solvent is compatible with the MS solvent, a low-sodium or\nno-sodium solvent was used in this study. With a low-sodium solvent,\nconductivity of the running buffer is much lower than that of the\nsample bands, which would cause a tailing effect in the peak due to\nthe electromigration dispersion effect.53,54 Another possible\nreason for peak broadening may be due to the weak buffer capacity;\nthe peptides could cause local pH effects that affected the peak shape.\nAfter solving eq 5, it\nis found that angiotensin I has an equivalent radius of 9.7966 \u00b1\n0.0385 \u00c5. By substituting the ion equivalent radius (R) in eq 6,\na one-to-one relationship could be obtained between the length-to-diameter\nratio (\u03a6) of angiotensin I and its semi-axis radius (c) as shown in Figure 3c, thus setting a structural restraint for angiotensin\nI in the liquid solution (named the restrain curve).",

Under the optimized\nworking conditions, these six compounds could be well separated in\ntwo domains: the migration time domain and the m/z ratio domain. Figure 5b plots the three-dimensional MCE\u2013MS spectrum,\nand Figure 5c is the\ncorresponding two-dimensional heat map. As noted in Figure 5c, these six biomolecules show\nup at different locations of the heat map due to their property differences.\nIn the m/z ratio domain, the sequence\nof ions is determined by the m/z ratios of ions in the gas phase after nanoESI. In the migration\ntime domain, the sequence of ions is mainly determined by physical\nsizes, charge, and folding states of ions in the liquid phase. Since\nthe drag force is proportional to the ion effective radius (R) and the electric field force is proportional to ion charge\n(q), ion migration time would be proportional to q and inversely proportional to R. As shown\nin Figure S1, larger ions with less charge\nwould show up earlier in the chromatogram, and the number of charge\nwould have bigger impacts on ion migration time than the ion effective\nradius. Results in Figure 5 show that phenylalanine shows up before angiotensin II and\nangiotensin II shows up before proteins, which might be due to the\nfact that larger biomolecules would possess more charges in solution.\nHowever, insulin has a very compact three-dimensional structure with\ndisulfide bonds and having less available charging sites, which might\nresult in a smaller q/R value than\nbradykinin. As a result, insulin travels faster than bradykinin in\nthe MCE capillary. Figure 5d plots the total ion chromatogram (TIC) of MCE and the corresponding\nmass spectra of these six compounds.",

The different charge states observed in the mass spectra\nare due to the ESI process, which would also unfold cytochrome c ions.\nOn the other hand, in a typical MCE experiment, cytochrome c would\nbe ionized first and then subject to the MCE separation.
