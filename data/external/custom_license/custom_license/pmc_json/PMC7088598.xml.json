Similarly, the highly adapted PEDV, attenuated DR13, was differentiated from wild-type PEDVs by both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), which used sequence variations in the ORF3 gene of the highly adapted PEDV [20].

Piglets inoculated orally with CV777, wild-type PEDV, became sick and developed severe diarrhea [2]. However, Piglets inoculated with KPEDV-9, which is serially passaged in Vero cells, showed reduced disease and lesions [23]. Similarly, attenuated DR13, which is highly adapted to cell culture, exhibited reduced pathogenicity and induced immunogenicity in pigs [20].

The suspensions were vortexed and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,800 \u00d7 g. Supernatants passed through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter (Acrodisk, Gelman) were used for virus isolation in Vero cells. Prior to inoculation, the growth media of confluent cells grown in 25-cm2 flasks (Falcon, USA) were removed and the cells were washed thrice with PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were inoculated with 1 ml per flask of the supernatants. After adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the cells were incubated in \u03b1-MEM supplemented with 0.02% yeast extract, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, and 2 \u03bcg of trypsin, as described previously [20, 24]. The PEDV DR13 was continuously passaged in Vero cells. Sequential passage of virus was regularly conducted every 4\u20135 days postinfection in cells. The supernatant was harvested and used for next inoculation in Vero cells up to 100 passages. PEDV was identified through RT-PCR method [25]. Attenuated DR13 strain made through process described above was used for manufacturing commercial vaccine such as the Korean PED oral vaccine (Green Cross Veterinary Product Co., Ltd., Yong-In, Korea).",

Attenuated-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 624 nucleotides encoding a protein of 207 amino acids with a predicted M\nr of 23.4 kDa. A single ORF of 675 nucleotides, with the potential to encode the coronavirus ORF3 protein, was identified [16, 28].

All PEDV ORF3 genes including wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs had a sequence (CTAGAC) of 46 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG, as previously recognized in Br1/87 [29]. This sequence is a hexameric motif common to coronaviruses and is similar to the hexameric motifs XUA(A/G)AC found adjacent to other PEDV ORFs. These hexameric motifs have been proposed as a starting site for the transcription of the subgenomic mRNAs [28].",

Out of all differences, only 51 nucleotide deletions, which were not found in the ORF3 genes of wild-type PEDVs, appear to be meaningful and may be significant for PEDV pathogenicity because they lead to changes in the predicted amino acid sequences of attenuated-type PEDVs. In addition, attenuated-type PEDVs (attenuated DR13, KPED-9) exhibited reduced pathogenicity in pigs when subjected to a high number of serial passages in Vero cell cultures [20, 23].

Parent DR13 was highly homologous to wild-type PEDVs rather than to attenuated-type PEDVs including attenuated DR13, even though it is the origin of the attenuated DR13. In addition, these homology differences, which were caused by deletions and were shown in wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs, could well imply that the ORF3 product is not required for replication of PEDV in cell culture [19, 21]. Moreover, wild-type PEDVs including CV777, Br1/87, LZC, parent DR13 and 12 field samples had high pathogenicity and maximum possible length of the ORF3 genes, the only form which could be detected in wild-type PEDVs. Attenuated-type PEDVs including attenuated DR13, KPED-9, and P-5V had reduced pathogenicity and ORF3 genes, which contain 17 amino acid deletions produced by 51 nucleotide deletions and could be detected in attenuated-type PEDVs. Therefore, the facts described above could well imply that ORF3 may be of importance in vivo [21] and postulated 17 amino acid deletions, which were produced by 51 nucleotide deletions observed in the ORF3 genes of attenuated-type PEDVs and were caused in process of adaptation to serial propagation in cell culture conditions, may influence the pathogenicity of PEDV.",

In addition, all PEDV vaccine strains were used as live virus vaccine because they previously exhibited reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Moreover, this RT-PCR require less labor, less money, and less analysis time compared with the previously established method, which differentiates the highly adapted PEDV from wild-type PEDVs by sequential use of both RT-PCR and RFLP [20]. Therefore, large deletion region, which is comprised of 17 amino acid deletions caused by 51 nucleotide deletions and is seen in all PED live vaccine strains, may be crucial for PEDV pathogenicity and we can use it for differentiation of wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs.",

We first found an ORF3 of 624 nucleotides having 51 nucleotide deletions compared to wild-type PEDVs and this deletion region might be important site of PEDV pathogenicity. In addition, RT-PCR using that deletion region is very useful to differentiate wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs. Moreover, the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF3 gene of the parent DR13, attenuated DR13, KPED-9, P-5V and 12 field samples will now form the basis for further functional exploration of both wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs. However, a clear correlation between specific genomic differences and pathogenicity is only possible with manipulation of an infectious clone of the virus. Therefore, further large scale experiments through construction of an infectious clone of virus will be needed for the functional studies of PEDV.",
