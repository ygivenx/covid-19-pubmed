In this work, Dupres et al. use AFM to map the distribution of adhesins on the surface of living Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) cells immobilized on a polycarbonate membrane, as well as measuring the interaction forces between the mycobacterial adhesin heparin-binding haemagglutinin adhesin (HBHA) and a model receptor. Most notably, this study revealed that the HBHA adhesin is not present uniformly on the mycobacterial surface but instead is concentrated in nanodomains that the authors refer to as adherosomes.",

In a recent issue of Cell, Mazmanian et al. looked at the specific effects of monocolonization of germ-free mice with Bacteroides fragilis and found that B. fragilis colonization was sufficient to correct the CD4+ T-cell deficiency in the spleens of these mice. B. fragilis expresses eight surface polysaccharides, several of which are zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs). Further investigations revealed that the most immunodominant of the B. fragilis ZPSs, PSA, is essential for the immunomodulatory effects of B. fragilis and can correct impaired systemic CD4+ T-cell maturation, an aberrant Th1/Th2 balance and defective development of the thymus. This is the first study to show a specific link between a bacterial product and the development of the mammalian immune system.",

Previous cell-based work had suggested that ACE2 was the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and now, reporting in Nature Medicine, Keiji Kuba and colleagues provide the first in vivo evidence that ACE2 has a crucial role in SARS infections using Ace2 knockout mice. The researchers go on to propose that the SARS-CoV spike protein exacerbates acute lung failure by deregulating the renin\u2013angiotensin pathway.",
