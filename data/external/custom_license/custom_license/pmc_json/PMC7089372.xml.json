Some scientists wrote articles and gave lectures, calling for heightened vigilance for the pilfering act, and proposed that the country protect its precious genetic resources by conducting genetic research on its own. While the public might have been completely flummoxed by some esoteric and arcane jargons, the message was nonetheless loud and clear: the Western capitalists were trying to profit from China\u2019s unique genetic heritage. In a country with a past history of repeated foreign invasion, defeat, and humiliation, this message struck a tender emotional chord and caused an eruption of national furor.",

Haseltine, a noted Harvard professor and AIDS researcher, partnered with some genomics companies and soon filed patents on 100,000 genes1 and, in 1999, quadrupled its stock price (Zimmer 2009). Other genomics companies followed suit. Yet this practice had one problem: most, if not all, patented \u201cgenes,\u201d in fact, RNA transcripts, were merely pieces of cDNA without any known functions at the time of filing. To understand what a gene does and how it does, and to establish the causal relationship between a gene and a human disease, let alone treatment, is by no means an easy task, even with modern technology. Very often, it is a slow, arduous, painstaking, and imprecise process full of dead-ends and false leads.",

Instead, through the collection of pedigrees enriched with patients having the disease, the existing genetic sign posts (called DNA markers, which are scattered around the human genome with known locations and content) would be used to localize the responsible gene in a particular region.2 This would allow researchers to zero in the gene, identify it, and ultimately figure out its function and its relationship with the disease through extensive lab work. Thus, by \u201cpositioning\u201d the gene, the gene could be cloned and its functions and roles in disease pathogenesis elucidated without any prior knowledge of the possible pathogenesis of the disease.3 This conceptual simplicity and beauty, coupled with increasingly fast and affordable methods of making genetic signposts (called \u201cgenotyping\u201d) attracted many biomedical scientists and even converted many of them to human genetics, who were frustrated by the slow, arduous and often fruitless process of finding the cause(s) for disease. Thus, in the 1990s hardly a week went by without a news report or announcement of the discovery of genes for some disease, at least in the US. One high-profile study, published in 1993 in a prestigious journal, Science, reported the localization of a gene in chromosome X 28q that is responsible for male sexual orientation.4\n",

One critical prerequisite for position cloning is the availability of a sufficient number of pedigrees saturated with people having the same disease, along with correct diagnoses or precise measurements of the disease (called \u201cphenotyping\u201d). Once such pedigrees are collected, phenotyping and genotyping can proceed and the positional cloning endeavor can start. Since genotyping and phenotyping a large number of people can be costly, there are strong incentives to cut the cost of either process. Everything else equal, locations with low costs of acquiring blood samples (for genotyping purposes) and labor (for phenotyping purposes) would be extremely attractive.",

Approximately 30% of the island residents had asthma, presumably passed on from an original settler generations ago. The announcement prompted cash payments of $2 million from Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany, based on a prior agreement. Boehringer later paid Sequana an additional $13 million for its exclusive right to market the drug derived from the putative asthma gene, while Sequana retained the exclusive right for developing gene-based diagnostics. Sequana announced in late May 1997 that it had identified a mutated gene that predisposes people to asthma, a feat hailed by one clinical investigator as \u201cperhaps this century\u2019s most important finding in the etiology of asthma\u201d (Asthma gene discovered. 1997).

In fact, while a small portion of breast cancer cases, for example, may be attributed to gene mutations, the large proportion of common and complex diseases is unlikely due to a few gene mutations or polymorphisms (see below). As demonstrated by an interventional study conducted in Finland, by reducing body weight, eating healthy and regularly engaging in physical exercise, the risk for developing type 2 diabetes can be reduced by nearly 60% (Tuomilehto et al. 2001). The dramatic changes in incidence of various diseases in China clearly show that many complex diseases have a very strong environmental component. Indeed, a 20-year interventional study conducted in Da Qing, China, shows that, after merely 6 years of lifestyle intervention after recruitment, those in the intervention groups had a 43% lower incidence over the 20 year period as compared with control participants (Li et al. 2008), very similar to the Finnish results.",

Lastly, one peasant in Anhui whose ordeal led to the exposure of apparent lapses in informed consent later recanted his story after talking with officials from Anhui and the Central government.

In fact, besides numerous reports of association of diabetes, asthma, and other complex diseases with certain genetic polymorphisms, so far not a single gene has been proven to be chiefly responsible for any of these diseases. Most genetic loci identified to be associated with the disease risk confer only miniscule relative risks, ranging from 1.02 to 1.5 (Kraft and Hunter 2009). Even when genetic polymorphisms that are associated with a modest increase in risk are combined, they generally have a low discriminatory and predictive ability (Janssens and van Duijn 2008). A more recent study reports that after examination of 101 genetic variants reportedly linked to heart disease, the variants turned out to have no value in predicting disease among 19,300 women who had been followed for over 12 years and that family history had better predictive value (Paynter et al. 2010).",

Science, as a space of maps of culture, is drawn by scientists hoping to have their research accepted as valid and recognized, their practices esteemed and patronized, and their culture sustained as home of objectivity, reason, truth or utility. The maps are then used by all who are unsure about the reality (Gieryn 1999). Yet maps of science change over time, as competing cartographers are constantly drawing, erasing, and redrawing the boundaries of science. By doing this, the scientist cartographers claim authority over a particular issue by taking it within their science or turf. Thus, vying for acceptance or the valid \u201ctruth\u201d among scientists is essentially a credibility contest, with winners viewed as the epistemic authority (Gieryn 1999). The one with the epistemic authority obviously would be the most influential, and their views and voices would be the most visible and vocal when it comes to policy issues (Greenhalgh 2008).",

In fact, when the process of deciding who would get resources lacks procedural justice, and when there is a lack of tradition for open and rational debate and of a checks-and-balances system, the credibility contest becomes literally a \u201cbeauty\u201d contest\u2014the most glamorous, in terms of rank, status, or simply seniority in the administrative ladder, but not necessarily the vision, merit, or talent, would get the resources. In a country where political loyalty and connections are valued far more than scientific merit and talent, the credibility contest further becomes a contest of political correctness or patriotism. Coupled with the lack of a clean and efficient government and of transparency and also with the pervasiveness of Guanxi or personal connections, this contest might create winners who are not necessarily the scientifically most visionary. As human beings, scientists are also susceptible to all human frailties. Aside from questing for epistemic authority, they also compete for resources and influence, and often vie for political clout, credit, fame, and even glamour, especially when such activities help their quest for epistemic authority or increase their professional and personal gains. If there are no set rules of the game with certain procedural justice or a checks-and-balances system in place that can curtail the tendency and channel it into the maximization of the common good, the human frailties, coupled with the lack of proper avenues for open debate, the contest would be an invitation for inefficiency, waste, corruption, and even disaster. Winners might take all, but in the long run the bad money drives out the good. The spectacular fiasco in containing the SARS epidemic and in sequencing the coronavirus that causes SARS are a prime example (Enserink 2003; Cao 2004).",
