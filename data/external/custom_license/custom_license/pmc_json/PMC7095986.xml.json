SARS patients have been treated empirically with a combination of ribavirin, oseltamivir, antibiotics and corticosteroids7,8,9. However, neither case-control studies nor animal models have been used to determine the efficacy of these drugs. The choice and evaluation of potential drugs is also hampered by poor understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.",

            "text": "We previously hypothesized that SCV infects type 1 pneumocytes, based on the character of the pulmonary lesions in experimentally infected macaques and the known tropism of other respiratory coronaviruses for type 1 pneumocytes2. We found extensive type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia in the lungs of SCV-infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., suggesting that there had been loss of type 1 pneumocytes at an earlier stage of infection2,12. To determine whether type 1 pneumocytes are infected by SCV at an earlier stage of infection, we conducted pathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the lungs of four SCV-infected macaques (control group) at 4 d.p.i.. The lungs had multifocal, acute DAD, which was characterized by flooding of alveoli with protein-rich edema fluid mixed with neutrophils and rare syncytia, extensive loss of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, and occasional type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig. 1a; for comparison, normal alveolar morphology is seen in Fig. 1b). Immunohistochemistry revealed extensive SCV antigen expression by squamous cells lining the alveolar walls (Fig. 1c,d; compare with Fig. 1e). These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes by their location, morphology and expression of keratin in serial sections. Transmission electron microscopy of alveolar cells revealed coronavirus-like particles measuring about 70 nm in diameter with typical internal nucleocapsid-like structure (Fig. 1f,g). These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes because they lined the alveolar lumen, were closely apposed to the basement membrane, were squamous, contained abundant pinocytotic vesicles, and\u2014in contrast to type 2 pneumocytes\u2014had neither lamellar bodies nor microvilli13. As found previously in experimentally infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., less extensive SCV antigen expression also was detected in hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes within inflammatory foci2 (Fig. 1h). Together, these histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings show that type 1 pneumocytes are the main target of SCV in early infection, and are associated with DAD.",

IFN-\u03b1 may inhibit replication of animal and human coronaviruses16,17,18. As a candidate drug, we tested the efficacy of pegylated recombinant IFN-\u03b12b, a registered drug for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C19. We chose this drug because it is registered and therefore directly available, because human recombinant IFNs inhibit SCV replication in vitro20, and because pegylation optimizes the pharmacokinetic properties of IFN21. We first tested the effect of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 on SCV-infected Vero cells, and observed a dose-dependent antiviral effect (Fig. 2a). We then determined the plasma levels of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 after intramuscular injection into a group of six macaques (prophylactic group). High plasma levels were attained 1 d after injection (Fig. 2b), similar to peak levels found in patients after subcutaneous injection with 3-\u03bcg/kg pegylated IFN-\u03b121. Because IFN-\u03b1 is known to activate macrophages22, we measured plasma levels of neopterin after pegylated IFN-\u03b1 treatment, as a measure of macrophage activation. Neopterin levels were increased in all animals (Fig. 2c), confirming the biological availability of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 in the treated macaques.",

We limited our investigation to pharyngeal swabs and the lung because an earlier study did not provide evidence of extensive viral replication in other organs2. We found that all parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in the prophylactic group compared with the control group. Virus excretion from the pharynx was abrogated (Fig. 3), and the virus titer in the lungs at 4 d.p.i. was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced (Fig. 4a). Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of SCV antigen in type 1 pneumocytes was reduced by 90% (Figs. 1e and 4b). By pathology, the extent and severity of DAD was reduced by 80% (Figs. 1b and 4c).

Targeting of type 1 pneumocytes by SCV explains why clinical disease and lesions are centered on the lower respiratory tract7,11,23, and fits with the lesions in early fatal SARS cases in humans11,23 and in experimentally infected macaques euthanized at 6 d.p.i. (ref. 2). When the pathological studies in humans and macaques are examined together, the following temporal sequence of lung lesions emerges: viral infection and subsequent loss of type 1 pneumocytes; acute DAD characterized by flooding of alveolar lumina with highly proteinaceous edema fluid; chronic DAD characterized by type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia; and, in severe cases, extensive pulmonary fibrosis. This sequence of events corresponds to the stereotypic alveolar reaction to acute lung injury from a variety of causes12. More detailed experimental studies will be needed to identify other possible target cells and further elucidate the pathogenesis of SARS.",

In these macaques, SCV infection of type 1 pneumocytes and severity of lung lesions were significantly reduced (Fig. 4), and viral excretion was abrogated (Fig. 3). Pegylated IFN-\u03b1 treatment may have an important influence on the outcome of SARS. In both virus-induced14,15 and toxin-induced24 DAD, the severity of pulmonary damage is dose dependent, with higher doses causing increased pulmonary fibrosis, loss of lung function and mortality. Reduction of the viral load by pegylated IFN-\u03b1 therapy at an early stage of SCV infection might therefore help prevent serious or fatal outcome of SARS associated with pulmonary fibrosis. In addition to potential disease mitigation, reduced viral excretion through pegylated IFN-\u03b1 therapy may also have an epidemiological effect by reducing the spread of SCV in the human population. Whether the mechanism of pegylated IFN-\u03b1 protection is by direct antiviral activity or immunostimulatory effects25 remains to be determined.",

Thus, substantial infection of type 1 pneumocytes may already have occurred by the time pegylated IFN-\u03b1 reached therapeutic levels. These in vivo findings are in accordance with the reduced in vitro activity against SCV of IFN-\u03b1 added after infection, compared with IFN-\u03b1 added before infection20.

We believe that these preliminary results warrant clinical studies with pegylated IFN-\u03b1, if and when SARS re-emerges. Prophylactic or early postexposure treatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 may help reduce the impact of SCV infection on health-care workers and others possibly exposed to SCV, and may limit the spread of the virus in the human population.",
