Furthermore, our NICU admits full-term infants with congenital anomalies as well as older infants for ROP and BPD management; these admission patterns help to elucidate the relatively older chronologic age of our study population. The overall sample size was small and we could not demonstrate factors associated with being symptomatic vs. asymptomatic, including the distribution of different viruses. The frequency of asymptomatic infants was likely underestimated because the practice for testing exposed infants was not conducted throughout the 5-year study period and we did not test unexposed, asymptomatic infants. It is also possible that unknown confounders or unexamined variables, such as viral load or patterns of care by specific HCP may be responsible for the observed clinical courses of infants in this study. We may have misclassified RV/EV transmission as the Biofire RVP does not distinguish specific virus types nor were the viruses sequenced. We also acknowledge that our strategy to discontinue transmission precautions if an infant has two negative tests does not consider intermittent viral shedding. Finally, we did not measure the impact of culture change in the NICU; following the adenovirus outbreak, staff had increased awareness of the clinical impact of respiratory viruses resulting in increased responsibility and accountability among staff to not work while ill themselves and to ask peers with respiratory symptoms to be evaluated by WH&S.",

Infants in the NICU with respiratory viruses can exhibit a wide range of symptoms including being asymptomatic, as demonstrated by both clinical and physiological data. Remarkably, we found that most symptomatic infants did not receive escalation of respiratory or nutritional support. While the evidence supporting effective infection prevention and control measures is still evolving, we found that screening asymptomatic infants after exposure and prohibiting visitors less than 12 years of age from visiting the NICU were associated with a reduction in incidence and transmission events of respiratory viruses. However, multicenter investigations are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings to identify factors associated with asymptomatic infants and to determine the most cost-effective IP&C strategies to reduce respiratory viruses in the NICU.",
