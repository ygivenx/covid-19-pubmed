These symptoms especially lead to high mortality rate in suckling piglet (90\u2013100%), which is the main reason for the huge economic losses in the global swine industry (Li et al. 2012b; Sun et al. 2012). Recently, there were one of the most severe outbreaks in the USA; about 7 million piglets (10% of total domestic pigs) died from the disease within a single year (Jung and Saif 2015; Paarlberg 2014).",

PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 28 kb in length and consists of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 3\u2032 UTR, and seven open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, E, M, and N (Kocherhans et al. 2001). The first two ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) encode two replicase polyproteins, and the remaining five code for an accessory protein (ORF3) and the following structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Duarte et al. 1994).",

In Asia, the first case of the disease was reported in China in 1973 (Sun et al. 2016), and subsequently occurred in other Asian countries such as South Korea (Kweon et al. 1993), Japan (Takahashi et al. 1983), Viet Nam (Toan et al. 2011), and Thailand (Puranaveja et al. 2009). In late 2010, highly pathogenic PEDV strains appeared in China and were considered as the first pandemic strains (Sun et al. 2012). In April 2013, the highly virulent PEDV was also first reported (Stevenson et al. 2013) in the USA and spread across the nation (31 states) (Cima 2013). Since then, the notorious strains emerged continuously in many other countries including South Korea (Lee and Lee 2014), Japan (Suzuki et al. 2015), Taiwan (Chiou et al. 2014), Canada (Pasick et al. 2014), Mexico (Vlasova et al. 2014). The PEDV strains detected in these countries were classified as US-like PEDV strains. In December 2013, a new PEDV strain OH851 (later designated as S INDEL PEDV) causing lower mortality rate which has specific insertions and deletions in N-terminal of the S protein (S1 region) was detected in the USA (Oka et al. 2014; Vlasova et al. 2014). The other S INDEL PEDVs have also been reported in South Korea, Philippine, France, Germany and Portugal.

Nevertheless, there was no time-calibrated phylogenomic study on this virus. In order to explore this topic, we analyzed 138 available public genome sequences that collected during the 38 years (1978\u20132015). The main focus of this study are (1) to characterize sequences of PEDV coding region; (2) to reconstruct the genome-wide phylogeny of the global PEDVs using two different analyses methods, Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML); and (3) to examine the various evolutionary mechanisms including selection pressure, substitution rate, divergence times, and effective population size changes using Bayesian coalescent approach.",

This package consists of six different recombination detection programs: RDP, GENECONV, MaxChi, BOOTSCAN, Chimeara, and SiScan. To avert the possibility of detecting false-positive recombinants, we considered only putative recombinant sites detected by at least 3 out of 6 methods.

We combined three molecular clock models (strict, relaxed uncorrelated exponential, and relaxed uncorrelated lognormal) with three different demographic models (constant size, exponential growth, and Bayesian skyline) to make nine datasets. These nine datasets were simulated following generalised time reversible (GTR) substitution model. Next, each dataset was run for 550,000,000 generations to ensure convergence of all parameters (ESS > 100) with discarded burn-in of 10%. By comparison of Bayesian factors (log10 Bayes factors > 2 in all cases), based on the relative marginal likelihoods of the nine models, the relaxed uncorrelated exponential clock and exponential population size model were selected as the best fit for the data set. The resulting convergence was analyzed using Tracer 1.6 (Rambaut and Drummond 2013a), and the statistical uncertainties were summarized in the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals. Trees were summarized as maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using TreeAnnotator 1.7.5 (Rambaut and Drummond 2013b) and visualized using Figtree 1.4.2 (Rambaut 2012).

Our plotting analyses also illustrated higher sequence variabilities for both nucleotides and amino acids in the S region, though both nucleotide and amino acid alterations were evenly distributed throughout the coding regions (Fig. 1).

Our pairwise comparison, of the complete coding genome sequences of 138 PEDVs, revealed that this virus had a high degree of genetic similarity compared to other porcine RNA viruses (average nucleotide identities, 77.8% for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 85.1% for foot-and-mouth disease virus, and 89.1% for classical swine fever virus) (Kwon et al. 2015; Yoon et al. 2013, 2011). Among the seven genes, our analyses showed that S was identified as the most variable, and the result was consistent with previous study (Huang et al. 2013). Like other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is a primary target for vaccination; it plays key roles in receptor binding for viral entry and neutralizing antibody induction for protective immunity (Huang et al. 2013; Makadiya et al. 2016). An additional finding of the present study is that, for each of classical and pandemic clade, there were a number of amino acid residues that were conserved through five genes: ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, and N. Here, as expected, S gene had the largest proportion of specific amino acid sequences in both classical and pandemic viruses. Since only a few amino acid substitutions in its sequence can alter the biological features as well as the antigenic properties of the virus, these specific amino acid residues might be regarded as useful markers for the classification and diagnosis of PEDV.",

Our findings revealed that there were two clearly defined top-level clades for PEDV, one containing the classical isolates and the other comprising the pandemic viruses. This point is consistent with the previous reports (Lin et al. 2016; Suzuki et al. 2015). The classical isolates were prototype CV777-like isolates that have appeared worldwide since the first report in England in 1971 (Oldham 1972). The pandemic PEDVs have also spread worldwide since the first emergence in China in late 2010 (Sun et al. 2012), and have caused great economic losses to the global swine industry due to its fatal mortality and morbidity. Within the pandemic clade, our phylogenomic trees showed two subclades (Asian and North American), and this supported the viewpoints of previous authors (Lee and Lee 2014; Suzuki et al. 2015; Vlasova et al. 2014; Yamamoto et al. 2016). Here, North American isolates that were first detected in the USA in April 2013, had a Chinese origin, which is in line with suggestions of other investigators (Huang et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2016; Suzuki et al. 2015). In addition, our results show that the North American pandemic clade were divided into two groups. The former consisted of only non-S INDEL PEDVs, while the latter was composed of both non-S INDEL and lower virulent S INDEL PEDVs containing insertions and deletions in the N-terminal region of the spike protein. This is in accord with the viewpoints of some PEDV researchers (Chen et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2016; Suzuki et al. 2015; Vlasova et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Finally, in order to explore the evolutionary mechanism of PEDV, we first co-estimated an overall evolutionary rate and population size changes as well as divergence times for the virus. The evolutionary rate of PEDV was computed at 3.38 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions/site/year for its complete coding genome, which was within the range of 10\u22122\u201310\u22125 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for nearly all RNA viruses (Duffy et al. 2008). These fast evolutionary rates of RNA viruses including PEDV generally arise from several factors such as short generation times, small genome size, rapid mutation, and lack of polymerase proof-reading (Elena and Sanju\u00e1n 2005). As a result, it is possible that RNA virus raises viral population adaptation, survival, and fitness, allowing them to spread to novel environments and hosts rapidly (Lauring and Andino 2010). Our molecular dating indicates that the tMRCA of PEDV was 75.9 (95% HPD 37.01\u2013126.65) years ago; they were derived approximately in 1940, which was about 9000 years later than the domestication of wild boar (Larson et al. 2005; Zeder 2008). This configuration revealed that the tMRCA of PEDV is similar to that of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) which are phylogenetically related porcine RNA viruses with similar genome size (28 kb). The tMRCA of TGEV and PRCV appeared in 1941 and the substitution rate was 7.5 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 (substitutions/site/year) (S\u00e1nchez et al. 1992). On the other hand, the origin of PEDV were relatively younger than other porcine viruses with small genome size; 786 for tMRCA of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (15 kb) (Yoon et al. 2011); 481 for tMRCA of foot-and-mouth disease virus (8 kb) (Yoon et al. 2011); 2770 for tMRCA of classical swine fever virus (12 kb) (Kwon et al. 2015). As above, the evolutionary rate and tMRCA of porcine RNA virus did not correspond to relationship between evolution rate and genome size. These conflicting result suggest that the evolution rate of porcine RNA virus was affected by other variables rather than genome size.",

This drastic change is visualized as a valley shape in our plot showing the effective number of infection occurrence. This feature was consistent with the history of PEDV prevalence as follows. Since the first report of PEDV in England in 1971, the virus prevailed until the 1980s in Europe. From the 1990s to early 2010s, the major outbreaks were also reported in East Asia. Moreover, most of them occurred in China between 2010 and 2012 (Gao et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2012). In 2012, the global outbreaks of PEDV actually seemed to settle down. However, unfortunately, there were recurrences of a new strain in April 2013 in the USA, and the virus spread to worldwide by 2015. The additional factor of the sharp decline of PEDV population size might be the decrease in host population resulting from the outbreaks of other porcine diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease; there was a culling of > 3 million pigs in South Korea during the 2010\u20132011 foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks. The effective population size change was helpful to understand PEDV evolution by complementing continuous information to the discontinuous information such as tMRCA and substitution rate on each node of phylogenetic tree.",
