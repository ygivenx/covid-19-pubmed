Chronic GVHD can affect nearly every organ system through a donor-origin cellular response directed against host tissue leading to immune dysregulation, immunodeficiency, and impaired organ function [2].

Whole saliva (oral fluid) is a complex mixture of salivary gland secretions, gingival crevicular fluid, plasma protein transudates, oral keratinocyte products, and microbial flora, which serve myriad protective antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory functions [9]. Changes in salivary function and mucosal breakdown seen in cGVHD could alter salivary composition and directly influence oral manifestations including pain, dysfunction, avoidance of nutritional food, infections, and oral health [2, 10]. Mucosal damage seen in oral cGVHD would further disrupt the local oral environment and facilitate the entry of microbial pathogens into the systemic circulation of patients, potentially contributing to sepsis after HSCT [11].",

The proteomic analysis of saliva has shown great promise as a tool for the identification of biomarkers for primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome [14, 15].

Considerable advances in detection and identification of the salivary proteome in the past several years have enabled finer analysis of the contents of saliva, and more detailed connections to systemic pathways [17, 18]. Consequently, the aim of the present study was twofold. First, to identify protein markers of oral cGVHD which could lead to improved diagnosis and monitoring after therapeutic intervention. Currently, the diagnostic gold standard for oral cGVHD is a clinical exam paired with biopsy of the buccal mucosa. Given that serial mucosal biopsy is not recommended for monitoring of the oral cavity, it would be preferable from the standpoint of both patient and practitioner to identify salivary markers for non-invasive serial testing. Second, a clearer understanding of salivary proteins impacted by oral cGVHD will elicit information about the mechanisms and etiological process of oral cGVHD which, in turn, could lead to development of more specific therapy.",

In the current pilot study, we applied cutting-edge salivary proteomic techniques to the identification of proteins in the pooled saliva of age- and gender-matched cGVHD patients with and without oral cGVHD with the overarching goal of determining the potential of these techniques for GVHD saliva analysis. In this study, a total of 180 proteins were confidently identified. Amongst these proteins, hemoglobin subunit alpha and hemoglobin subunit beta were identified, which may be due to contamination of saliva samples from hemolysis of red blood cells. The alpha and beta hemoglobin subunits have also been detected in whole ductal saliva, collected directly from a cannulated parotid gland, which strongly suggests that these 2 subunits of hemoglobin may be an intrinsic part of saliva. It is postulated that these blood proteins may enter normal saliva through the leaky epithelium in the parotid and potentially other salivary glands. Their detected levels did not differ between groups in this study, so blood contamination of cGVHD saliva is not considered to be a major confounding factor. A \u22652 or \u2264 0.5 fold change cut-off [23] was applied to the above list, resulting in the identification of 102 differentially expressed proteins. A two-fold cut-off of differentially expressed proteins indicates doubling, or 100 % increase in the expression ratio.

Targeted free label confirmation focused on 3 proteins: lactotransferrin, lactoperoxidase and albumin, and detected significant downregulation of both lactotransferrin and lactoperoxidase, but no change in albumin levels, in the saliva of GVHD subjects.",

            "text": "Of particular interest is the reduction in detectable lactotransferrin in saliva of cGVHD patients. Lactotransferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in high concentrations in epithelial secretions including saliva and human milk. This multi-functional antimicrobial compound is found in the secondary granules of neutrophils and also acts as a primary defense against bacteria via sequestration of iron that results in release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the outer microbial membrane and thereby stymies bacterial growth [26, 27]. Furthermore, low levels of lactotransferrin act synergistically with other antimicrobial compounds to increase overall potency and rate of bacterial killing [27]. This protein acts not only as an antimicrobial compound, but also has mitogenic capacity, and plays a role in the activation of the cellular immune system through TLR4-dependant and independent macrophage activation [28, 29]. Lactotransferrin involvement has been previously implicated in oral and gut cGVHD [16, 30]. A 2001 case report detailed successful use of supplemental lactoferrin to treat gut GVHD refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy [30]. A 2007 saliva survey from our group found increased salivary levels of lactotransferrin through 6-months post-transplant in GVHD patients. In contrast, the present study and included a post-transplant age-matched patient population that was much later, on average, 45-months [16]. Involvement in both screens, however, clearly implicates lactotransferrin in an altered salivary proteome following HSCT.",

These proteins are secreted extracellularly, where they inhibit proteinases, thereby limiting proteolysis and tissue damage [31, 32]. Cystatin D is a potent inhibitor of human coronavirus at physiologic salivary concentrations [33]. Thus, lower levels of these proteins may be lead to increased tissue damage and lower defenses against common viral infections.",

Targeted label-free quantification of select proteins supports the use of mass spectrometry for validation in large patient population as noninvasive tests for screening, early detection, and monitoring of cGVHD.
