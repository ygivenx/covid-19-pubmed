            "text": "Many patents have been granted in genetics in recent years. For example, up to the end of 2004, the European Patent Office granted 2,913 patents containing the term 'nucleic acid' in the claims, and 549 of these were granted in 2004 alone. The omnipresence of genetic patents has raised serious concerns about access to and use of genome-related inventions, as the expansion of genetic patents might result in a patent thicket. As it is unlikely that patents for genetic inventions will be carved out from patent law, it is extremely important to develop alternative strategies to maximize access to and use of genetic inventions. Some models already exist for facilitating access to patented gene technology. Research exemptions create access for research purposes, and licensing agreements and compulsory licences are well-known tools for encouraging access. Other models that could render proprietary genetic inventions accessible for further use are under discussion, such as patent pools and clearing-house mechanisms. Patent pools and clearing-house mechanisms have been suggested by various governmental and non-governmental organizations as useful mechanisms to deal with the specific problems of access and use of patented genes, diagnostic methods, technologies and tools that are used in genetics.",

The original provision, which was laid down in the Community Patent Convention, states that the rights that are conferred by a patent shall not extend to \u201cacts done for experimental purposes relating to the subject-matter of the patented invention\u201d. The equivalent provisions in the European member-states mirror but sometimes also deviate from this wording. Because different national legislations and court rulings exist, the exact scope of the exemption differs from country to country. There seems to be a general consensus that the exemption applies irrespective of the way the patented subject matter has been put into operation and the place of the experiment, be it a public laboratory, hospital or private company. But doubts arise about the scale, nature (experiments 'on' versus experiments 'with' the patented subject matter) and final purpose of the experiment (commercial versus non-commercial goal), and whether these fall within the exemption1,2,3,4. At present, it is unclear to what extent the research exemption can shield diagnostic testing. On the one hand, one could argue that diagnostic testing falls within the research exemption, because patient blood or tissue sampling is often necessary to do research. On the other hand, one could claim that diagnostic testing cannot fall within the exemption because once a diagnostic test is established, the act of diagnosis could be defined as and/or confined to the act of providing the referring medical doctor with an opinion as to whether or not the patient carries a deleterious mutation.",

            "text": "In the United States the research exemption is not part of the patent act but exists as a judicially created theory. The theory has a very narrow scope of application. In the landmark case Madey v. Duke University5 \u2014 which in fact involved electron laser technology, not genetics \u2014 it was recalled that: \u201cRegardless of whether a particular institution or entity is engaged in an endeavour for commercial gain, so long as the act is in furtherance of the alleged infringer's legitimate business and is not solely for amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for strict philosophical inquiry, the act does not qualify for the very narrow and strictly limited experimental use defence.\u201d Furthermore, the profit or non-profit status of the user is not decisive for the applicability of the doctrine. Research projects that are financed by major research universities but that have no prospect of commercialization further the institution's legitimate business objectives, including: \u201ceducating and enlightening students and faculty participating in these projects\u201d, and \u201cserve to increase the status of the institution and lure lucrative research grants, students and faculty\u201d5. This means that, after the Madey v. Duke University case, universities can no longer invoke experimental use in their defence. Concerns have been raised about this extremely limited interpretation by the US Federal Circuit of the experimental-use theory6,7. In practice, however, the research exemption is administered more flexibly because companies hardly ever sue universities8.",

Recently, the Supreme Court held in Merck v. Integra \u2014 a case about the use of the Arg\u2013Gly\u2013Asp (or RGD) tripeptide in cell-adhesion experiments \u2014 that the use of patented inventions in preclinical research, the results of which are not ultimately included in a submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), also falls within the scope of this exemption10. This interpretation of the exemption that is defined in the Hatch\u2013Waxman act seems to be broad when compared with the limited interpretation of the common law experimental-use exemption in the Madey v. Duke University case. However, one should take into consideration the limited scope of application of this statutory exemption: it only applies to research that is related to drug development. It remains to be seen to what extent this case will influence the interpretation of the common law experimental-use exemption.",

Royalties and transaction costs might be reduced to a minimum by negotiating cross licences. Cross licensing might be attractive in various settings, including cases of complementary patents and blocking patents. The exchange might concern more than two patents, or in some cases even entire portfolios.

Furthermore, patent pools offer an interesting instrument for government policy: it is better to encourage companies to establish patent pools than to force them into a compulsory licensing scheme19 (see below). Such a suggestion seems to ignore the fact that the main prerequisite for establishing patent pools is the voluntary participation of all patent holders, whereas the compulsory licensing mechanism is the last-resort instrument for patent holders who do not voluntarily wish to enter into (reasonable) licensing negotiations.",

Such a global approach could increase the incentives for patent holders to participate voluntarily in the model by limiting the points of registration. Additionally, owing to the global character of the genetics market place, potential licensees would be better served by a global check-point for existing patent rights.

In this regard, the European Union has not only taken the necessary steps to put the compulsory licence for public health to work for the benefit of developing countries45, but various European countries have also designed specific public-health licences for domestic use.

Various measures can facilitate access to patented technology and render proprietary genetic and genomic inventions accessible for further use. One possibility for guaranteeing the freedom to operate is to exempt certain activities from infringement. Examples include exemptions for scientific research or submission of information. For activities that do not fall under the research exemption, licensing is probably used most regularly to gain access to patented technology, at least when not too many patent holders are concerned. Patent-pool schemes and clearing-house models might be helpful to settle the presence of multiple patents and multiple patent holders and offer a solution for inventors who wish to gain access to a patent thicket. Nevertheless, parties to licensing agreements should always be aware of the potentially anti-competitive restrictions in their agreement that might lead to a violation of competition law.
