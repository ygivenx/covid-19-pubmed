Therefore, predicting the outcome in IPF is challenging. Major progress has been made in recent years, with particular efforts to identify patients with the highest risk of disease progression who might benefit the most from treatment interventions. Clinical phenotypes with different survival have been identified. Overall, a poorer prognosis is associated with older age (>70 years), smoking history, low body mass index, severe physiological impairment, large radiological extent of disease and the presence of pulmonary hypertension [2].",

[11] observed in 9 % of the patients with AE-IPF the presence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus); conversely, no viruses were detected in the BAL from stable patients. Furthermore, pan-viral microarrays reveal additional evidence of viral infection [herpes simplex virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and torque teno virus (TTV)], in patients with AE-IPF. TTV infections are significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls, but present in a similar percentage of disease controls with acute lung injury. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirms the presence of TTV, but does not identify additional viruses.",

Prolonged mechanical ventilation, high tidal volume and high concentration of supplemental oxygen during surgery have been suggested as potential causes [14]. A recent study indicates that ambient air pollution may also cause AE-IPF, particularly by ozone and nitrogen dioxide [15]. Finally, some drugs may be responsible for the occurrence of AE-IPF, including biologic (anakinra, etanercept and infliximab) and nonbiologic (ambrisentan) agents and immunomodulatory (everolimus, interferon alpha and beta) and antineoplastic agents (both conventional chemotherapy and new drugs as tyrosine kinase inhibitors).

Of note, subjects were initially enrolled in this study during an admission to the hospital, suggesting that the study population was enriched for prior episodes of AE-IPF or rapidly progressive disease. The incidence of AE-IPF may vary greatly with the severity of disease, the delay since the diagnosis of IPF, diagnostic criteria used and efforts made to rule out infection. This is illustrated by data from a recent high-quality IPF trial, in which only about half the cases of acute deterioration suspected by investigators to be AE-IPF were eventually confirmed to be AE-IPF by an adjudication committee [23].",

Nevertheless, somewhat comparable results were obtained in a retrospective review of an observational cohort of 147 patients with biopsy-proven IPF, with 11 meeting the criteria for AE-IPF [26]. The 2-year incidence of AEs is 9.6 %, and AE-IPF-related mortality is 78 %; the incidence of AE-IPF in this study with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of IPF may differ from those in which IPF was diagnosed without biopsy due to potential selection bias. The time from the first visit to the onset of AE-IPF ranges between 3 and 60 months. The retrospective design of this study may have underestimated the incidence rate, as 14 additional cases of acute worsening could not be included due to missing data. This south-Korean study suggests potential higher mortality in the Asian population compared to Caucasian patients, which might be linked to genetic susceptibility. Mortality may vary, however, with the diagnostic criteria used, the population studied, comorbidities, potential genetic factors and, most of all, the time at which mortality is assessed. Whether earlier diagnosis and management might improve outcome is unknown.",

Using a different approach, Martinez et al. [28] evaluated the clinical course of patients with mild to moderate IPF and found that an apparent acute clinical deterioration preceded death in 47 % of patients who died from IPF. Autopsy findings also show that AE are the most common immediate cause of death in patients with IPF [29].

AE may occur at any time during the course of IPF, although they are more common in patients with more progressive disease such as those with decline in FVC at 6 months after baseline [30]. There is no clear association with age. A smoking history may protect from AE-IPF [27], although AE-IPF appear to be more common in males [26], but data are conflicting regarding smoking. In one study, a comparison of clinical features between IPF patients with and without AE-IPF shows no difference in age, smoking status, oxygenation and lung function at the time of diagnosis [26]. Ambient air pollution, particularly the increase in exposure to ozone and nitrogen dioxide emanating largely from motor vehicles, increases the risk of AE-IPF [15]. Pulmonary hypertension at the time of evaluation for lung transplantation increases the risk of subsequent AE in IPF, likely through endothelial dysfunction [31]. Data from several studies suggest seasonal variations in AE-IPF, with an increased frequency during winter months [32\u201334]. Patients with a history of AE-IPF have a higher risk of subsequent AE-IPF events [34]. Gastroesophageal reflux is also a risk factor for AE-IPF, as administration of proton pump inhibitors significantly reduces the incidence of AE-IPF [13]. Pepsin levels, a marker of gastric aspiration, are elevated in BAL fluid from patients during AE-IPF compared with those obtained in stable disease [12]. Symptomatic reflux may explain a higher risk of AE in patients with asymmetrical IPF [35].",

Noninvasive molecular methods, including urinary antigens for S. pneumoniae or Legionella as well as blood cultures and sputum cultures, are generally indicated. Performing bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage can be useful to exclude other causes of acute respiratory failure, especially infection. It is often difficult or impossible to perform due to severe dyspnea or acute respiratory failure and does not yield the diagnosis of AE-IPF itself. Therefore, the benefit:risk balance of bronchoscopy must be carefully evaluated at an individual level.

Because the vast majority of these patients will die in the intensive care unit or during the follow-up period, a decision not to intubate is generally taken, especially when infection and potential confounding factors have been ruled out [27, 81, 82]. However, a small subset of patients might be eligible for lung transplantation, and in this case a more aggressive approach in the intensive care unit can be considered [83]. Interestingly, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was able to be used successfully as a bridge to lung transplantation in 11 patients with acute respiratory failure refractory to all other interventions [84]. In this retrospective study, ECMO was used for a mean of 17 days (range 2\u201356 days); nine patients were transplanted, out of whom eight were alive 1 year after transplantation. Such encouraging experience highlights how organization of care and early inclusion on the transplant list of potential candidates are paramount to offer this potentially life-saving intervention in the event of AE-IPF.",
