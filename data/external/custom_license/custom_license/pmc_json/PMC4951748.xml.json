The role of healthcare professionals including physicians and nurses has been emphasized in the literature.6\u201311 Moreover, nurses play an important role in health promotion by encouraging patients and their families to be part of the decision-making process regarding problems related to their health, improving adherence of patients to long-term therapies, and improving their quality of life.7\u20139 Despite the tendency of physicians to focus on diagnosis and treatment of illness after its occurrence, they also have an essential role in incorporating health promotion and disease prevention at all levels, including health improvement, risk reduction, early identification of disease, and reduction of complications.11 Their role can be effective through providing counseling services where they are required to be updated with relevant guidelines, and ensuring that their recommendations are supported by the best evidence.12\n",

However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of delivery in patient education with regard to patient clinical outcome, satisfaction, and efficacy.19 In our study, we investigated the most widely available methods of health promotion/education and the methods most preferred by healthcare professionals. The study was designed in such a way to allow further study on a larger scale in an attempt to build on what has been used and practiced. On reviewing the literature, we found that health promotion in a clinical setting has been widely investigated in Western communities.20\u201321 The attitudes of physicians and nurses toward disease prevention and health promotion activities in primary care settings have recently been investigated in a large multicenter study in Spain. It revealed an acceptable attitude towards prevention and health promotion (PHP) activities, but recommended that healthcare organizations increase health promotion activities to improve professional skills and provide appropriate care.20 A study that was conducted in Saudi Arabia concerning the perceived practice of health promotion among nurses identified language barriers and cultural competencies as great obstacles in the process of delivering effective health promotion in the region.22 However, little is known about the practice of health promotion in Saudi Arabia.22\u201324 Thus, we found that there is a need for such a study that assesses the practice of health promotion locally.",

Second, the study only took place in the city of Riyadh; therefore, the results are not representative of the provision of health promotion as a whole in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and possibly in the selected population as convenience sampling was used. Third, due to time constraints, we were unable to 1) explore the quality of health promotion services provided by the hospitals, 2) examine the overall satisfaction with health promotion services for patients attending the primary healthcare centers, 3) track the health outcomes of patients receiving condition-specific health promotion and education, and 4) assess whether the health promotion/education was provided with consideration of cultural relevance and the literacy demand among the targeted population.
