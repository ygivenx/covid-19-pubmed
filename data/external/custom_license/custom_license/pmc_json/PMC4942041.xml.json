In the guidance document \u2018Global surveillance during an influenza pandemic\u2019 released by the World Health Organization, three parameters were highlighted that should be documented quickly in this respect: the incubation period (time between infection and symptoms), the serial interval (time between symptoms onset in primary case and secondary case), and the reproduction ratio/number (average number of secondary cases per primary case).\n3\n These parameters are instrumental to assessing the feasibility and efficacy of intervention strategies against pandemic influenza.\n4\n\n",

Two studies used modeling to explicitly account for such phenomenon: in both approaches, the modeled mean SI was shorter than the empirical mean of observed values (2\u00b76 vs. 2\u00b79\n24\n; 2\u00b75 vs. 3\u00b74\n31\n).

While the most used approach relied on determining the initial exponential growth, the formulas and fitting methods changed with authors and how the initial exponential growth period was chosen was little documented. When provided, the sensitivity analyses illustrated that somewhat arbitrary hypotheses (choice of the GT, correction for under\u2010reporting, exponential growth period,\u2026) had a large effect on the reported value. In Mexico alone, estimates ranged between 1\u00b72 and 3\u00b71 during the same period.\n29\n, \n34\n, \n38\n, \n40\n, \n42\n Factors explaining these differences were numerous. The first is differences in data, either by nature (travelers back from Mexico or suspected/confirmed cases in Mexico or local epidemics or genetic sequence) or by collection time. For example, cases were added to the epidemic curve in retrospect, so that early estimates were biased upwards.\n38\n A second factor was the choice of the GT distribution, shorter mean GTs leading to smaller reproduction number estimates: from 3\u00b71 (mean GT = 4 days) to 2\u00b72 (mean GT = 3 days),\n38\n from 3\u00b74 (mean GT = 5\u00b75 days) to 1\u00b79 (mean GT = 2\u00b73 days; supplementary material\n29\n), and from 2\u00b70 (mean GT = 2\u00b76 days) to 1\u00b74 (mean GT = 1\u00b79 days\n34\n). When similar mean GTs were allowed (approximately 3 days), less variability was present (2\u00b72,\n38\n 2\u00b70,\n34\n 2\u00b73\n29\n). A third factor was underdeclaration in the initial period of the pandemic, leading to smaller estimates: from 2 to 1\u00b74\n42\n and from 2\u00b76 to 2\u00b74.\n29\n Methods less dependent on the completeness of the data (genetic sequences, travelers out of Mexico) consistently led to lower estimates, from 1\u00b72 to 1\u00b77.",

Estimating R\n0 requires an additional assumption on the initial susceptibility of the population, and all authors reporting R\n0 assumed, often implicitly, that the whole population was initially susceptible. It is now known that adults over 50 years of age were less susceptible to the disease,\n24\n, \n49\n making this assumption incorrect. Practically, this means that it is unlikely that any of the reported estimates were truly \u2018basic\u2019 and that accounting for differential susceptibility will be required to obtain R\n0 estimates. For public health purposes, however, it is the initial R which is the most relevant estimates as it informs on the required strength of interventions and is useful to calibrate mathematical models. In this respect, the reproduction number may have been poorly estimated at the start of the pandemic, as a result of poor case ascertainment; how imported cases in the course of the outbreak were accounted for in estimation; and the over\u2010representation of places like schools where transmission was large.\n45\n Several new methods have been proposed to estimate the reproduction number during the pandemic,\n34\n, \n36\n, \n42\n, \n50\n, \n51\n which should now be compared in terms of data requirements, applicability, and how they deal with the issues listed earlier to help select best practice.",
