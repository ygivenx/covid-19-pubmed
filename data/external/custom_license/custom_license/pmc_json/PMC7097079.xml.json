This interaction triggers the entry of the virus particle into the cell, the dissociation of the nucleocapsid and ultimately, the release of the viral genome, to be used for reverse transcription and integration (in the case of HIV) or RNA synthesis (for example, for hepatitis B virus (HBV)) or directly for protein production (such as for HCV) (Fig. 1). Viral proteins, together with host cell factors, catalyse the amplification of the viral genome, which is packaged into progeny virions. These are released from the cell to initiate a new round of infection.",

            "text": "Entry inhibitors for HIV-1. Regarding entry inhibitors, during the past two decades, most progress has been made in the treatment of infections with HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Entry of this virus requires the interaction between the primary receptor CD4 and one of two chemokine receptors that act as co-receptors: CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4; X4) and CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5; R5)5 (Fig. 1). Whereas CXCR4 is expressed on T cells and promotes the entry of T cell-tropic HIV-1 (X4-strains), CCR5 is expressed on macrophages and some populations of T cells and promotes the entry of macrophage-tropic HIV-1 (R5 strains). Intriguingly, individuals with certain mutations in CCR5 are resistant to infection with R5 strains, which predominate during the early stages of infection, whereas X4-tropic strains emerge during the later stages of infection6 \u2014 thus qualifying CCR5 as an attractive target for HDTs6. Antagonists of CCR5 have been developed7 that lock the receptor into a non- permissive conformation and thereby dampen its co-receptor function. This concept, which was originally established in vitro, has been translated into clinical use, and Maraviroc (Selzentry/Celsentri; Pfizer) was approved as a first-in-class CCR5 inhibitor in 2007. As expected for an HDT, resistance to Maraviroc is low, and given the importance of CCR5 in HIV infection Maraviroc has become a component of HIV-1 therapy8. Apart from its virological benefit, Maraviroc has also been found to increase the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in some patients, suggesting that it has an additional immunological benefit8. The underlying mechanisms are unclear but could be due to the involvement of CCR5 in immune regulation. However, the clinical use of Maraviroc is limited given its restriction to R5-tropic viruses. Precise HIV typing can delay the onset of treatment and can cause therapy failure when virus tropism changes in the patient. Accordingly, companion diagnosis and individualized treatments are required for this and other selected HDTs.",

            "text": "Entry inhibitors for hepatitis viruses. Another example of an entry inhibitor is the investigational agent myrcludex B, which is a peptide derived from the large surface glycoprotein of HBV (Supplementary information S1 (table)). This peptide binds to the cell surface molecule sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), which is required for productive HBV infection9,10, and blocks viral entry with extremely high potency (IC50 of approximately 80 pM)11 (Fig. 1). Intriguingly, the same entry receptor is also exploited by hepatitis D virus (HDV) \u2014 a satellite virus that requires the surface glycoproteins of HBV for virus particle formation (reviewed in Ref. 12). Thus, HDV is consistently associated with HBV, and this co-infection is responsible for the most severe form of virally induced liver disease. Because of this peculiar biology, myrcludex B also blocks the entry of HDV9. The IC50 values of myrcludex B for HBV and HDV entry inhibition are comparable and more than 500-fold lower than the IC50 of bile salt transport inhibition, suggesting that virus entry can be blocked at doses with minor effects on the physiological function of NTCP. Encouraged by these results, clinical trials have been conducted and have demonstrated the excellent tolerability of even high doses of myrcludex B13. Moreover, a phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of myrcludex B as a monotherapy in patients with chronic HBV\u2013HDV co-infection revealed a strong reduction of HDV RNA serum levels and the normalization of liver enzymes (markers of liver cell damage). There was also a synergistic antiviral effect on HDV and HBV levels in patients treated with a combination of myrcludex B and polyethylene glycol-conjugated (pegylated) interferon \u03b12a (PegIFN\u03b12a)14. Myrcludex B received orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and further clinical trials are ongoing.",

            "text": "Targeting the HDFs required for HCV replication. Apart from targeting entry receptors, HDFs that are required for viral replication are equally attractive drug targets. One example is the host cell chaperone cyclophilin A (CypA). By using replicon-based assays, it was found that the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A (CsA) potently inhibits HCV replication15 by binding to and thereby sequestering CypA. Subsequent studies identified CypA as the primary HDF that promotes HCV replication16,17. As CypA is likely to be required for the proper assembly and activity of the HCV replicase complex, its sequestration renders the replicase inactive18. However, the CypA\u2013CsA complex inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which is required for T cell activation, thus causing an immunosuppressive effect. Therefore, non-immunosuppressive Cyp antagonists, which are mostly derived from CsA, have been designed, including alisporivir (previously known as Debio 025), NIM811 and SCY-635. Although phase I and phase II clinical trials conducted with alisporivir and SCY-635 have demonstrated the inhibition of HCV across different genotypes and a high genetic barrier to resistance19,20, further clinical development of these compounds was not pursued, presumably due to the very rapid development of direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) for HCV. However, CypA is a host cell factor used by viruses from different families, such as coronaviruses21 and HIV22, suggesting that CypA antagonists have the potential to be developed into broad-spectrum antivirals. Although natural pre-existing mutations in the HIV capsid protein, the CypA interaction partner, would limit the broad clinical use of this compound class, CypA-knockout mice and human cells are fully viable23,24, and therefore possible toxicity associated with CypA inhibition should be low.",

This miRNA is preferentially expressed in hepatocytes, the primary host cells of HCV, and regulates lipid metabolism, but also binds to several regions of the HCV genome, most notably two regions close to the 5\u2032 end, and stimulates RNA replication25. Soon after the discovery of miR-122 as an HDF of HCV, antisense-based oligonucleotide approaches (known as antagomirs) were developed to sequester miR-122 in infected cells, thereby blunting HCV replication. This approach was well tolerated both in vitro and in vivo and imposed a high genetic barrier to resistance26,27. However, studies with miR-122-knockout mice identified this miRNA as a tumour suppressor28,29, which raised concerns about its inhibition. Moreover, given the challenges in the delivery of miR-122-specific antagomirs, to the best of our knowledge only one clinical candidate, RG-101 (Regulus Therapeutics) which is an N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated oligonucleotide that antagonizes miR-122 and that is targeted to hepatocytes, is being pursued in combination with different approved or investigational DAAs30.",

However, this area of research has been somewhat neglected, and the role of IFNs in controlling HIV infection has only recently received increasing attention69. For example, the administration of IFN\u03b12a in the rhesus macaque model before and after infection with a pathogenic strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) prevented systemic infection, but continued IFN\u03b12a treatment dampened the host IFN response, concomitant with reduced antiviral gene expression70. In addition, blocking the type I IFN receptor reduced antiviral gene expression, enhanced SIV replication, and spread and accelerated CD4+IFN\u03bb1aT cell loss70. Interestingly, a phase II clinical trial of PegIFN\u03b12a in patients infected with HIV-1 revealed a significant, albeit moderate, reduction of plasma viral load after 12 weeks of treatment71. These observations suggest that the administration of supraphysiological levels of IFN to patients infected with HIV-1 can help to control virus replication. However, HIV-1 has developed numerous strategies to avoid detection by pattern recognition receptors and to block IFN-induced restriction factors, thus limiting the anti-HIV activity of IFN\u03b169. Moreover, increased IFN\u03b1 activity seems to contribute to immune activation and immune dysfunction in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, dampening IFN\u03b1 production, although it may have detrimental effects on suppressing HIV replication, might reduce immune activation and thus the severity of disease.",

Different strategies are currently being pursued to tackle these challenges, including a 'shock and kill' approach, in which latent HIV-1 is reactivated in T cells to allow the killing of these cells through immune effector functions76. One example is the stimulation of the RIG-I pathway by the approved retinoic acid derivative acitretin. This treatment activates HIV transcription and RIG-I expression, which in turn senses HIV RNA, thus mounting an IFN response and preferentially inducing the apoptosis of HIV-infected cells77. Although early clinical studies with drugs such as acitretin that trigger the transcription of the proviral genome have raised hopes that this strategy can be used to reverse HIV-1 latency, the extent to which this strategy can reduce the viral reservoir size remains to be determined.",

The potential efficacy of checkpoint blockade with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 in hepatitis B is underscored by additional studies showing that anti-PD1 is effective in other chronic viral infections: for example, the treatment of HCV-infected chimps with an anti-PD1 antibody enhanced antiviral T cell responses and reduced viraemia83.

However, hyperinflammation downstream of excessive cytokine stimulation can promote disease exacerbation (see below), and high doses of TNF cause necroptotic macrophage death and extracellular bacterial replication. Current cytokine-based HDT approaches mostly involve IFN\u03b3 or modulators of TNF. For example, the delivery of aerosolized IFN\u03b3 to patients with TB has been shown to reduce time to sputum conversion without consistent improvement of the chest radiological outcome105,106. In small trials carried out in cohorts of patients with drug-resistant TB, adjunct therapy with IFN\u03b3, in addition to facilitating bacterial killing, improved lung repair107,108,109. However, cytokine-based HDT strategies that modulate TNF as an adjunct to canonical chemotherapy seem to be more promising, as they considerably shorten therapy duration, improve pathology and limit TB relapse in experimental models (as detailed below).",

            "text": "Amendment of immune suppression in TB. The expression of inhibitory PD1 molecules is upregulated during persistent antigenic exposure as it occurs in chronic infections, including TB, cancer and sepsis116,117,118. Signalling via PD1 inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production and induces lymphocyte apoptosis. Impaired T cell immunity promotes Mtb replication and subsequent tissue damage. Building on the impressive success achieved in cancer immunotherapy119, checkpoint blockade has been considered for TB therapy (Fig. 3). This includes monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are specific for PD1 (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and for cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4; such as ipilimumab). The T cell expression of PD1 gradually decreases during canonical chemotherapy, with a concurrent increase in TH1 cell responses120,121,122. Moreover, the expression of PDL1 on macrophages123 and neutrophils124 has been reported in patients with TB and has been linked to impaired T cell and natural killer T (NKT) cell functions122,125. In vitro treatment with a PD1 mAb of cell cultures derived from patients with TB reduced immunosuppression by blocking T cell apoptosis, restoring IFN\u03b3 production and triggering IFN\u03b3-dependent killing of Mtb-infected macrophages122,123. Similarly, the increased surface expression of CTLA4 has also been reported in TB121,126,127, and the checkpoint receptor LAG3 was found to be highly expressed by CD4+ T cells and NK cells in the lungs of non-human primates that progressed to active TB, but not in animals with LTBI128. This observation suggests that changes in LAG3 expression patterns influence disease outcome and Mtb replication. Finally, the blockade of TIM3, another checkpoint receptor on T cells, increases the propensity of myeloid cells to kill Mtb. These effects were linked to the increased production of IFN\u03b3 by T cells and the increased production of IL-1\u03b2 by Mtb-infected macrophages129,130. Moreover, release from T cell exhaustion that is caused by the blockade of TIM3 has improved Mtb control in mice that are chronically infected with TB131. However, interventions using checkpoint inhibitors in general warrant caution because blocking the inhibitory effect of PD1 on T cells thereby increases the IFN\u03b3-producing capacity of lung-homing subsets of CD4+ T cells and has caused extensive lung pathology in murine models of TB132. Finally, anti-PD1 therapy can reactivate LTBI133, suggesting that checkpoint blockade should be considered only in adjunct to canonical TB chemotherapy.",

GM-CSF stimulates the generation of granulocytes and monocytes or macrophages; a predominant function of IFN\u03b3 is to activate monocytes and macrophages. Although small early studies of GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3 in patients with protracted sepsis seemed promising142,143, subsequent trials failed to demonstrate a consistent benefit144,149. More recently, investigators have targeted therapy with GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3 to patients who are in the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis146,147,148. In a study of 38 patients with sepsis with low monocyte HLA-DR expression, GM-CSF therapy shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation, improved the severity of illness scores, and reduced the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays147. GM-CSF was also efficacious in a study of immunosuppressed paediatric patients with sepsis, who were identified by measuring ex vivo whole-blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TNF production148. GM-CSF administration to patients improved ex vivo LPS-stimulated whole-blood TNF production and decreased the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Based on these encouraging results, a multicentre trial of GM-CSF in sepsis is currently under way150.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most exciting immuno-adjuvant agent in sepsis is IL-7, a cytokine that is essential for the survival of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. IL-7 has multiple beneficial effects on host immunity, including the proliferation and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and it also increases the surface expression of cell adhesion molecules, thereby facilitating the trafficking of T cells to sites of infection. IL-7 also counteracts sepsis-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. This anti-apoptotic effect of IL-7 is particularly important because the severe depletion of immune effector cells \u2014 including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and DCs \u2014 is a pathophysiological hallmark of sepsis141,152,153,154. Multiple studies from independent laboratories have shown that IL-7 improves survival in various clinically relevant animal models of sepsis155. Importantly, it has been shown that IL-7 is effective in reversing T cell dysfunction in circulating immune cells from patients with septic shock154. So far, IL-7, which has been given to more than 300 patients in the treatment of various disorders, has consistently increased circulating absolute lymphocyte counts, and has been well tolerated152. In patients with AIDS, IL-7 restored the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, leading to decreased circulating markers of inflammation153. This effect may also be particularly helpful in patients with sepsis, as the loss of gut barrier integrity in sepsis is thought to facilitate the translocation of bacteria and/or LPS into the circulation, thereby driving the inflammatory response. IL-7 has also been administered on a compassionate basis to patients with lymphopenia and John Cunningham (JC) virus-induced progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy. In this setting, IL-7 increased lymphocyte counts and decreased JC virus load and survival156. A multicentre clinical trial of IL-7 in sepsis is currently ongoing157.",

Importantly, multiple independent groups have reported that PD1 is overexpressed on circulating T cells in patients with sepsis and that the incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with specific antibodies against PD1 or PDL1 can restore impaired cytokine production and can decrease sepsis-induced apoptosis116,117,118. Moreover, animal models of sepsis have shown that the delayed administration of PD1- and PDL1-blocking antibodies improves survival. Given the surprising overlap in the immunological deficits in cancer and sepsis158, and the remarkable success of PD1 and PDL1 inhibition in cancer immunotherapy119, there is a strong rationale for trials of these antibodies in sepsis, and a small multicentre, dose safety trial of anti-PDL1 in patients with sepsis has recently been completed159.",

Another encouraging approach to boosting immunity in patients with sepsis is treatment with thymosin \u03b11, a 28-amino acid polypeptide that was originally derived from mouse thymic extracts (Supplementary information S3 (table)). Although the exact mechanism of action of thymosin \u03b11 is unknown, it is currently thought that it functions, in part, as a TLR agonist. Thymosin \u03b11 is known to enhance T cell and DC function, to increase IL-12 production, and to improve antibody responses160. Similar to treatment with PD1 and PDL1 inhibitors, thymosin \u03b11 has shown benefit in the treatment of both cancer and infectious diseases. Thymosin \u03b11 showed efficacy in improving survival in a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial of 361 patients with sepsis. Compared with patients treated with placebo, patients who were treated with thymosin \u03b11 had increased monocyte HLA-antigen D related (DR) expression and a decrease in 28-day mortality160. Based on these results, a larger multicentre trial of thymosin \u03b11 in sepsis has been initiated161.",

            "text": "The devastating consequences of viral infections frequently arise from an excessive, often uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such cytokine storms can be triggered by multiple mechanisms, including the hyperactivation of TLRs. Examples include dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which are most often caused by secondary infection with a heterologous serotype of dengue virus (DENV). These serious cases are characterized by the uncontrolled hyperproduction of cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF, IFNs, CC motif chemokine 8 (CCL8) and CXC motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), ultimately leading to vascular leakage and shock syndrome162. Key drivers of cytokine storms seem to be high-level viraemia, the ligation of DENV\u2013immunoglobulin complexes to myeloid or mast cells, and the secreted version of the viral protein NS1, all of which drive excessive pro-inflammatory responses, while reducing anti-inflammatory ones. NS1 binds to TLR4 and induces the production of the same cytokines that are detected during the course of severe dengue disease and enhances vascular permeability163. Blocking NS1-mediated TLR4 activation with a TLR4 antagonist or with a TLR4-specific antibody markedly reduced vascular leakage both in vitro and in a mouse model of DENV infection163. Moreover, autophagy induction in endothelial cells seems to be required for NS1-induced vascular leakage, which can be blocked by autophagy inhibitors164. Finally, DENV NS1 also promotes vascular leakage by inducing the expression of enzymes such as sialidases and heparanase that degrade the glycocalyx layer that lines the endothelium on the luminal side, thus diminishing its barrier function and enhancing fluid extravasation165. Although to the best of our knowledge no clinical trials have yet been conducted, these results hold great promise for the suppression of exacerbated inflammation by targeting NS1-specific ligands and receptors. Alternative strategies for HDT-based symptomatic treatment of severe dengue disease are based on immunosuppressive therapy with steroids such as prednisolone, but so far these have met with only limited success166,167.",

It has been proposed that acute lung injury that is triggered by infection with respiratory viruses and bacteria induces, via ROS, the production of pathogenic oxidized lipids that activate TLR4 and induce a cytokine storm168. Consistently, Tlr4-deficient mouse mutants are protected from lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted influenza virus strain169. Notably, the TLR4 antagonist eritoran, an investigational drug for the treatment of severe sepsis, consistently decreased lung pathology and clinical symptoms in various in vivo influenza models170.

Inflammatory pathways, involving both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (primarily cytokines and lipids) are sequentially turned on and off in TB184. Accordingly, mechanisms that restrict and promote inflammation are relevant both at distinct disease stages and at specific infection sites. An imbalance of these responses, rather than solely an exacerbated pro-inflammatory response, is the characteristic feature of TB. Different forms of lesions, such as solid, fibrotic, mineralized and caseating granulomas, as well as cavities and foci of pneumonia, can coexist within a patient185; even within a single lesion, inflammatory mediators are segregated into distinct regions186. Therefore, concurrent application of pro- and anti-inflammatory intervention may become a necessity. Such a therapy concept for the spatiotemporal coexistence of hyper- and hypo-inflammation poses a great challenge that has barely begun to be addressed experimentally187. Current HDT approaches comprise small molecules and biologics that target anti- and pro-inflammatory pathways as adjunctive measures for TB therapy (Fig. 3; Supplementary information S2 (table)).",

The COX product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a pro-apoptotic eicosanoid that protects against necrotic cell death during mycobacterial infections188. Mtb skews the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway towards lipoxygenase (LOX) activation and the generation of pro-necrotic lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The modulation of this axis by zileuton, a clinically licensed 5-LOX inhibitor for the treatment of asthma, and the nasal application of PGE2, can restrict lung pathology in murine TB189 (Fig. 3). Combination therapy of zileuton and PGE2 boosts cytoprotective IL-1\u03b2 production by limiting type I IFN production and by restricting Mtb replication. Balanced PGE2 and LXA4 levels are probably involved in the successful control of Mtb in LTBI compared with active TB. During active TB, IL-1 concentrations are increased190,191,192 and the abundance of IL-1 correlates with the extent of tissue damage that is mediated by neutrophils193. In LTBI, the early production of PGE2 seems to be essential for protection, whereas heightened PGE2 levels at later stages of infection impair immune defence and promote progression to disease194,195. COX inhibitors \u2014 such as ibuprofen195, aspirin196 and diclofenac197,198 \u2014 given alone or in combination with canonical TB drugs, limit bacillary loads and prolong the survival of TB-susceptible mice. In addition, ibuprofen has direct antitubercular activity199 (Fig. 3). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, inhibit PGE2 production and enhance LXA4 generation, which in addition to its effects on Mtb-induced cell death also shows anti-inflammatory functions. NSAIDs, by limiting PGE release and inducing lipoxin production, lower TNF abundance188, and thus are likely to ameliorate local inflammation. Certain NSAIDs, notably aspirin, have already entered clinical trials for TB200,201,202. Ibuprofen was also registered in a phase II clinical trial for therapy of XDR TB203.",

In several cases, mAbs against TNF (such as infliximab and adalimumab) have shown beneficial effects against life-threatening TB206,207. Etanercept, a soluble TNF receptor, has demonstrated modest benefits in adjunct therapy in TB208. However, in contrast to etanercept, mAbs against TNF can reactivate LTBI by destabilizing granulomas204. Whereas this is a contraindication for rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases, it could be beneficial as adjunct therapy for TB to facilitate the killing of metabolically active bacilli and may represent a 'shock and kill' strategy209.",

            "text": "Various classes of drugs that affect TNF signalling and that reactivate LTBI have shown potential for HDT in TB. For example, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, which is licensed for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, has been associated with the reactivation of LTBI214 and impaired bacillary containment in murine TB215. The coadministration of tofacitinib with canonical chemotherapy was beneficial in selected models of TB, suggesting that the activity of JAK inhibitors is influenced by patterns of inflammation and granulomatous responses216. Additional approaches to modulate TNF signalling or abundance include thalidomide analogues48 and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors217. Thalidomide improved treatment outcome in a pilot study in pulmonary TB218; however, a clinical trial to test adjunct thalidomide therapy in paediatric TB was terminated owing to adverse events, including skin rash, hepatitis, severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia219. As thalidomide is teratogenic, thalidomide analogues with better safety profiles have been synthesized. Analogues that inhibit PDE4 signalling by increasing cAMP levels have shown beneficial effects as adjuncts to canonical TB chemotherapy in mouse and rabbit models of infection220,221,222. These compounds accelerate bacillary clearance and promote lung repair. Other PDE inhibitors, including cilostazol (an inhibitor of PDE3) and sildenafil (an inhibitor of PDE5), showed similar effects215,223. The nonspecific PDE inhibitor pentoxifylline was unsuccessful in TB trials, despite reducing TNF levels and inducing TB progression when administered as a monotherapy in mouse models224,225. The most advanced PDE inhibitor in preclinical studies, CC-11050, has completed phase I trials48, and a phase II trial is planned to compare CC-11050, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, the thioredoxin reductase inhibitor auranofin and vitamin D as HDT adjuncts to standard chemotherapy for the accelerated cure of drug-sensitive TB95,202,208.",

            "text": "Another approach to restricting local inflammation includes the co-delivery of glucocorticoid receptor agonists, such as prednisolone and dexamethasone, with TB chemotherapy. The effects of glucocorticoids on immune cells are multifaceted. Corticosteroids reduce the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, notably TNF, restrict the migration of inflammatory cells and cause apoptosis. For patients with TB, such interventions are beneficial because they counteract inflammation and are likely to improve drug penetration into granulomas, fostering the clearance of metabolically active Mtb as a consequence of lesion destabilization. Adjunct treatment with glucocorticoids began more than five decades ago for patients with different forms of the disease, including TB meningitis, TB pericarditis and pulmonary TB226. In many cases, corticosteroids seemed to improve the resolution of lesions, albeit without major long-term benefits227. A recent meta-analysis indicated that glucocorticoid receptor agonists mostly reduce TB mortality when the central nervous system is affected, notably, in TB meningitis227. The benefits of glucocorticoids depend on the genotype of the patient228, indicating that divergent effects are the result of different patterns of inflammation \u2014 genotype-specific hypo- or hyper-inflammation \u2014 in different patients, which influence Mtb replication. A meta-regression analysis of pulmonary TB revealed that, in addition to genotype effects, the dosage of corticosteroids affects sputum conversion in patients with TB229. A phase II clinical trial that tested corticosteroids in combination with standard chemotherapy for TB in patients co-infected with HIV indicated faster sputum conversion, but also adverse events at high dosages230. Further studies to more carefully assess the risks and benefits of glucocorticoids are underway, and the delivery of glucocorticoids has been prioritized as an HDT for specific patient groups, such as those suffering from TB and AIDS comorbidity. The use of prednisone or the NSAID drug meloxicam for the prevention of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is observed in patients co-infected with HIV and Mtb, has reached phase III and phase II trial stages, respectively231,232. Similarly, the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone is now in phase II/III and phase IV trials for the therapy of meningeal TB233,234.",

Sepsis has traditionally been considered a disorder that is caused by an uncontrolled, exacerbated host inflammatory response to invading pathogens.

The discovery of TNF and other cytokines reinforced the concept that morbidity and mortality in sepsis were due to an unbridled cytokine-mediated host response. The fact that inhibitors of TNF prevented death in animal models of sepsis caused by endotoxin and Escherichia coli further supported the idea that morbidity in sepsis is due to excessive cytokine-mediated inflammation.",

Granulomas have a reduced blood supply, particularly at sites of necrosis, thereby restricting the access of chemotherapeutics to the site of Mtb infection. Consequently, HDTs that promote vascular perfusion can improve drug delivery. However, such a strategy may equally benefit Mtb by facilitating access to nutrients and permissive host cells. The situation is somewhat reminiscent of neoplastic diseases, in which tumours actively promote angiogenesis to improve blood supply and to alleviate local hypoxia at late stages of tumour development. The outcome of vasculogenesis-focused HDT for TB is likely to depend on the stage of disease and the treatment objective, namely, interference with either angiogenesis or vascular permeability. In patients with active TB, factors that induce neovascularization, notably vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR, are abundant in the circulation238,239,240 and have been proposed as biomarkers of disease severity241. Bevacizumab, a mAb against VEGF, is approved for the treatment of certain cancers, and several other antibodies that target VEGF or VEGFR are in clinical trials. In animal models of TB, VEGF and VEGFR inhibitors have revealed beneficial effects when given in combination with conventional drugs, by limiting bacterial dissemination and boosting the activity of drugs that target hypoxic Mtb242,243. Conversely, there is a risk that the administration of such biologics without concurrent chemotherapy may promote TB reactivation244,245 and bacillary dissemination240.",

Oxygen tension gradually decreases in granulomas, reaching hypoxic values in necrotic areas247. In such a milieu, Mtb gains increased drug resistance as a consequence of clonal selection in response to local monotherapy owing to poor drug penetration into necrotic lesions and adjustment to extracellular cues248,249,250. In addition, bacilli switch to fatty acid-based metabolism and adopt a persistent phenotype249. Host adaptation to a hypoxic and nutrient-deprived microenvironment encompasses a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis251. This metabolic adjustment, known as the Warburg effect, is well established in cancer252. Therapies that limit aerobic glycolysis, including the delivery of 2-deoxyglucose as an anti-glycolytic agent, can restrict bioenergetic pathways that support Mtb replication. Moreover, interfering with the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013AKT\u2013AMPK signalling pathway can inhibit glutamine entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and thus can revert the local Warburg metabolism. Metformin is an AMPK activator and thus its efficacy as an HDT goes beyond its effects on macrophages (as discussed above), as it has the potential to interfere with the immune metabolism of granulomas. Less well-explored, but still of interest, are bioenergetic shifts that encompass the generation of itaconic acid, a structural analogue of succinate, which controls TCA remodelling in macrophages, and which has an anti-mycobacterial function253. Additional metabolic changes in granulomas lead to the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which affect macrophage death and activation254. AGEs have been detected in TB granulomas, and pathways that regulate the generation of AGE could be potential HDT targets.",

Genetic association studies support a crucial role of MMPs in lesion progression257,258. These zinc-dependent proteases, mainly MMP1, MMP8 and MMP9, cleave the extracellular matrix, mostly collagen, and are linked to early granuloma formation, lesion progression and cavitation256. The antibiotic doxycycline inhibits MMP1 and MMP9, thereby restricting exacerbated inflammation and tissue damage in TB259. The delivery of doxycycline limits immunopathology and promotes tissue healing and lung repair. Doxycycline has a well-defined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile owing to its broad use as anti-infective drug and may therefore have the potential to be rapidly repurposed for TB. Other MMP inhibitors, such as batimastat and marimastat, as well as Ro32-3555, deserve evaluation in TB.

Similarly, hyper- and hypo-inflammatory lesions coexist in TB, thus requiring personalized treatment regimes. In addition, the capacity to identify particular defects in innate or adaptive immunity by immune profiling, such as T cell exhaustion, increased frequencies of T regulatory cells and of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), will enable personalized approaches to correct these.

Within the nucleocapsids the vRNA pre-genome is reverse transcribed by the viral polymerase (red circle) and virions are formed by budding into the ER lumen.

During active TB, granulomas progress towards necrosis and caseation, leading to cavitation and bacterial expectoration. Such lesions contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in distinct metabolic and replicative stages: replicating and metabolically active bacilli in caseous granulomas; and non-replicative, dormant bacteria in the hypoxic environment of solid granulomas. In a single patient, different granuloma types coexist that harbour Mtb with an active or a dormant phenotype. Hence, strategies to restrict or to promote inflammation are envisaged as potential host-directed therapy (HDT) for TB. The selection of a particular HDT depends on the rationale for applying it as stand-alone treatment, for example, to limit exacerbated tissue damage, or as an adjunct to canonical TB therapy to promote inflammation and facilitate killing of actively replicating Mtb. Interference with arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, which generates both pro- and anti-inflammatory metabolites and which also modulates patterns of cell death in infected cells, and interference with cytokine signalling and selected cellular therapies, such as the maturation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), can correct exacerbated inflammation. The amendment of immune suppression by checkpoint blockade can restrict inflammation by correcting levels of protective interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3); however, this may facilitate hyper-inflammation once pathological levels of the cytokine are achieved. Drugs interfering with such mechanisms limit immunopathology and help to preserve tissue functionality. Immune-suppressive drugs, notably glucocorticoids and biologics, besides limiting life-threatening inflammation, reduce the local abundance of host-protective cytokines and thereby facilitate lesion caseation and promote the resuscitation of dormant Mtb. Metabolically active bacteria can be targeted by canonical TB chemotherapy. Limiting vasculogenesis restricts nutrient supply and access of Mtb-permissive cells to granulomas. Metformin, glycolytic agents and kinase inhibitors interfere with metabolic pathways activated under hypoxic conditions that support bacillary replication, and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) limits collateral damage and Mtb spread.
