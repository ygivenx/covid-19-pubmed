HBV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL)-mediated immune response is multi-specific, polyclonal, and vigorous during acute hepatitis B (AHB), which plays a vital role in viral control and viral clearance, as well as disease pathogenesis (Yukihiro, 2012; Westover and Hughes, 2007; Tan et al., 2008). Whereas HBV-specific CTL response is minimal or undetectable in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with viral persistence and immune tolerance, indicating the key role of HBV-specific T-cell response in determination of disease progression and outcome (Bertoletti and Gehring, 2006; Zhang et al., 2013).",

Analysis of CTLs specific for viral epitopes within core (Sendi et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012;), envelope (Liu et al., 2008), polymerase (Rehermann et al., 1995), and X (Hwang et al., 2002) proteins showed that the highly conserved HBV core protein (HBc) elicits the strongest CTL responses than other viral proteins, suggesting that HBc-specific T cell response may play a leading role in viral control and clearance. To identify immune-dominant HBV-specific CTL epitopes, especially epitopes from HBc protein, is therefore necessary for monitoring T cell responses during disease progression, as well as for developing epitope-based therapeutic vaccines against CHB (Inchauspe and Michel, 2007; Gordon et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013a, b).",

However, most of these identified epitopes are derived from HBV of genotypes A and D, few HLA class I restricted epitopes have been defined in virus of genotypes B and C, which are more prevalent in Asia. Meanwhile, currently the mostly used methods to predict and identify T cell epitopes are either by computer algorithms based on the mode of peptide binding to MHC molecules, or measurement of T cell responses of PBMCs simulated with panels of overlapping peptides (Liu et al., 2011). These epitope identification strategies may ignore unconventional T cell epitopes as computational analysis is largely based on the characteristic of anchor residues.",

Several peptides were found to have high affinity for binding to HLA-A*0201 molecules, as evidenced by the FI (0.72 for HBc183\u2013191, 2.41 for HBc141\u2013149, 2.64 for HBc60\u201368 (V60), 2.47 for HBc18\u201327, and 0.04 for HBc82\u201390), as shown in Fig. 1B. HBc141\u2013149 spanning from HBc aa 141 to 149 was chosen as the focus of this study due to its high binding affinity among the top hits from screening. To determine the minimal sequence length of the epitope, panels of N- or C-terminally truncated or extended peptides of HBc141\u2013149 were synthesized. The FIs of truncated peptide HBc141\u2013148 (STLPETTV) and HBc142\u2013149 (TLPETTVV) were only 0.124 and 0.151, respectively (Fig. 1C).

All HBc141\u2013149 truncated and extended peptides displayed little binding to HLA-A*0201, which indicates that the 9-mer peptide HBc141\u2013149 is the optimized epitope in length.

The crystal structure of the HLA complex was determined to 2.3 \u212b resolution (Table 1). The structure of HLA-A*0201/HBc141\u2013149 shows that HBc141\u2013149 possesses a typical conformation of an HLA-A2-restricted 9-mer epitope (Fig. 2A and 2B). The unambiguous electron densities of HBc141\u2013149 clearly show that position 2 (T2) and position 9 (V9) are buried in pockets B and F, respectively (Fig. 2C). Compared to the typical HLA-A2-restricted epitopes which have an anchor residue Leu or Met at position 2, HBc141\u2013149 has Thr at position 2. The side chain OH of Thr does not disrupt its inserting into the hydrophobic pocket B properly (Fig. 2D). Instead, the side chain OH of Thr can form a strong hydrogen bond interaction with H atom of Glu on the \u03b11 domain of the heavy chain, which helps HBc141\u2013149 binding to the HLA-A2 heavy chain and stabilizes the entire complex. The side chains of amino acids P4, E5, and V8 protrude out from the HLA-A2 surface and may be involved in T cell receptor (TCR) attachment and recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure showing the binding features of HLA-A2 to HBc141\u2013149 with an unconventional P2 anchor Thr.",

Immunization with HBc141\u2013149 led to a 35.5% decrease in serum HBsAg levels (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4C), and a significant reduction of viral DNA levels (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4D) at week 8 compared to the negative control.

Notably, compared to CHB patients infected with HBc141\u2013149 wild-type viruses, patients with HBc141\u2013149 mutants had much higher (approximately 3.3-fold) HBV DNA loads (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5C).

These methods are effective and rapid to purposefully identify epitopes, however, a considerable number of atypical or unconventional epitopes may be ignored or missed by these methods due to the limitation of anchor residues analysis-based computation (Liu et al., 2011). In this study, an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool was used to screen B and C genotype-derived HBc-specific CTL epitopes, and HBc141\u2013149 was identified as a new 9-mer HLA-A2-restricted T cell epitope. Importantly, similar numbers of HBc141\u2013149-specific and immunodominant epitope HBc18\u201327-specific CD8+ T cells were observed in AHB patients (Fig. 3C), indicating that HBc141\u2013149 is an immunodominant epitope in HBV-infected patients. However, the newly defined epitope HBc141\u2013149 (STLPETTVV) in this study possesses Thr at position 2. Different T cell epitope prediction programs, including SYFPEITHI (http://www.syfpeithi.de/Scripts/MHCServer.dll/Epitope-Prediction.htm), NETMHC (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/), and BIMAS (http: //www-bimas.cit.nih.gov) show the binding score of the epitope HBc141\u2013149 to HLA-A2 is only 0, 1.465, and 0.414, respectively. As HBc141\u2013149 does not get a high score, it could be omitted in conventional screening. Interestingly, as for HBc141\u2013149 (STLPETTVV), the side chain OH of Thr2 can form a stronger hydrogen bond interaction with Glu on \u03b11 domain of the heavy chain, which helps its inserting into pocket B (Fig. 2D) of HLA-A*0201 and stabilize the entire complex. Therefore, our data indicated that Thr may also act as a dominant role as a P2 anchor for HLA-A2-binding peptides, which may be taken into consideration in the future designation of these online prediction programs.",

As a consequence of long-term interaction between HBV and infected patients, the virus evolves mutations to reduce epitopes for evading immune detection and clearance, especially escape from T cell recognition (Maman et al., 2011; Westover and Hughes, 2007). Indeed, nonsynonymous mutations in HBV epitope have been found to be associated with disease progression in CHB (Kim et al., 2011; Frelin et al., 2009). Consistent to these studies, we found that mutations in the newly defined epitope are positively related to viral parameters and pathogenesis of liver disease. The effect of mutations within HBc141\u2013149 on viral replication capability, as well as the potential impact of the epitope-specific CTLs on the interplay of HBV and chronically infected patients remains to be addressed.",

We further demonstrated that mutations within this epitope may affect disease progression in CHB. Given the key role of CD8+ T cells in viral clearance, our work provides valuable insight for the functional implications of HBc141\u2013149 epitope-specific T cell response in HBV infection. Understanding the epitope-specific CTL function in the complex regulation networks that orchestrate T cell response, viral persistence and immunoevasion in CHB will allow to predict disease progression and develop immunotherapeutic approaches against HBV infection.",
