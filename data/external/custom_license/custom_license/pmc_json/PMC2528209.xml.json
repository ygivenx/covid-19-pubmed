Part of the natural history of this disease is intermittent acute episodes of increased respiratory symptoms and worse pulmonary function that may be accompanied by fever and other constitutional symptoms, which are characterized as acute exacerbations. These exacerbations are a major driver for office visits, hospitalizations and therefore cost of care in COPD. In advanced disease, they are also the most frequent cause of death in this disease (Burrows and Earle 1969; Calverley et al 2007). The frequency of exacerbations varies widely between patients, but is generally correlated with the severity and duration of underlying COPD.",

Though the acute symptoms tend to subside over the course of 2\u20133 weeks, quality of life takes several months to recover. Furthermore, this recovery is delayed if exacerbations recur during this recover period (Spencer and Jones 2003). Contrary to previous studies, recent data has shown that the frequency of exacerbations is associated with accelerated long term decline in lung function as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). This has been shown in mild disease, in the Lung Health Study, where every lower respiratory tract illness was associated with an additional loss of 7 ml of FEV1 (Kanner et al 2001). Patients with moderate to severe COPD who experience more frequent exacerbations also experience a decline in FEV1 of 40 ml/yr in contrast to a decline of 32 ml/year among patients with infrequent exacerbations (Donaldson et al 2002).",

Substantial progress has also been made in understanding their etiology and pathogenesis. In contrast, clinical studies of adequate design and quality that can help us determine the optimal management approach to exacerbations are still relatively few. Among the therapeutic options for the treatment of acute exacerbations are antibiotics. Though widely used for the treatment of exacerbations, their use is still debated and whether antibiotic choice is important is controversial (Hirschmann 2000; Murphy et al 2000). The optimal approach to antibiotic treatment of exacerbations relies upon an accurate diagnosis, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. This needs to be followed by determining the severity of an exacerbation, the probability that it is bacterial and whether antibiotics are indicated. Once the decision is made that antibiotics are indeed indicated, then a risk stratification approach allows us to choose an appropriate antibiotic.",

Unfortunately, this is not the situation with acute exacerbations of COPD, with an imprecise and variable definition and the absence of objective measures (Rodriguez-Roisin 2000). There are two widely used definitions of exacerbation. The Anthonisen definition is based on the presence of one or more of three cardinal symptoms, including an increase or new onset of dyspnea, sputum production and sputum purulence (Anthonisen et al 1987). In case only one cardinal symptom is present, then one or more supporting symptoms or signs are required to make the diagnosis, including an upper respiratory tract infection in the past five days, wheezing, cough, fever without an obvious source or a 20% increase in the respiratory rate or heart rate above baseline. Though simple and clinically useful, this definition is narrow in its scope and several important symptoms of exacerbation such as chest congestion, chest tightness, fatigue and sleep disturbance are not included.",

This definition though more inclusive, is not specific with regards to the nature and duration of symptoms. Also missing in both definitions is the clinical exclusion of entities that could present in a similar manner, such as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, upper respiratory infection, noncompliance with medications etc. Older research in this field did not exclude these entities from the definition, confounding both the research findings and clinical approach to exacerbations. These clinical entities have distinct etiology, pathogenesis and treatment, and therefore should be in the differential diagnosis of an exacerbation rather than be included under the definition.",

However, lung function is difficult to measure during exacerbations, and often the change with an exacerbation is of the same magnitude as day to day variability in these measurements. Severity has been also measured by site of care, with hospitalized exacerbations regarded as severe, outpatient exacerbations regarded as moderate and self medicated exacerbations as mild (GOLD 2007). This classification is prone to error as the site of care is dependent on differences among countries and health care systems as to the threshold for admission, patient and physician preferences etc. Another suggested measure of severity of exacerbations is the intensity of treatment recommended, with treatment with bronchodilators only indicating mild exacerbations, while treatment with antibiotics and steroids in addition to bronchodilators regarded as indicating moderate or severe exacerbations. Again, this approach is beset with problems of preferences and practice approach.",

This classification relies on the number of cardinal symptoms and the presence of some supporting symptoms as shown in Table 1. Interestingly, this classification was not designed to be a classification of severity of exacerbations, but has become so over time. This determination of severity is relatively simple and does correlate with benefit with antibiotics, with such benefit seen only in Type 1 and 2 exacerbations. However, there are limitations to the Anthonisen severity classification. It has not been validated against objective measures of severity. The association with benefit with antibiotics has not been reproduced in other studies. Another limitation is the lack of gradation of severity within each symptom, such that an exacerbation with mild dyspnea and mild increase in sputum would be regarded as the same severity in this classification as one with a marked increase in both symptoms.",

Biomarkers represent such an objective measure and potentially could either define an exacerbation, determine its etiology or determine its severity. In a recent study by Hurst et al of 36 plasma biomarkers in 90 patients with exacerbations, none of them alone or in combination were adequate to define an exacerbation (Hurst et al 2006). In another study of multiple serum biomarkers in 20 hospitalized patients with exacerbation, reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) correlated with decrease in dyspnea during recovery from exacerbation, while decreases in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) were proportional to recovery in FEV1 (Pinto-Plata et al 2007). Sputum free neutrophil elastase activity has been shown to correlate with clinical severity of an exacerbation as assessed by a clinical score based on symptoms and signs (Sethi et al 2000). Development of patient reported outcomes and biomarkers should provide us with a better definition and objective measures of severity of exacerbations in the future.",

Measurement of airway inflammation in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased airway inflammation is indeed present in acute exacerbation and resolves with treatment. Both neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation has been described, with the former associated with a bacterial etiology and the latter with viral infection. Any stimulus that acutely increases airway inflammation could lead to increased bronchial tone, edema in the bronchial wall and mucus production. In an already diseased lung, these processes could worsen ventilation-perfusion mismatch and expiratory flow limitation. Corresponding clinical manifestations are dyspnea, cough, increased sputum production, tenacity and purulence along with worsening gas exchange, which are the cardinal manifestations of an exacerbation.",

Indeed, environmental pollutants, both particulate matter, such as PM-10, and nonparticulate gases, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, are capable of inducing inflammation in vitro and in vivo (Devalia et al 1994; Ohtoshi et al 1998; Rudell et al 1999). Infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses and atypical pathogens are implicated as causes of up to 80% of acute exacerbations, and are discussed in greater detail below (Sethi 2000).",

NTHI, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the predominant bacterial causes of two other common respiratory mucosal infections, acute otitis media in children and acute sinusitis in children and adults. These mucosal infections have been related to anatomical abnormalities with impaired drainage of secretions, antecedent viral infections and defects in innate and adaptive immunity. All these predisposing factors likely exist in COPD. These three pathogens are all exclusively human pathogens that are transmitted among individuals. In healthy hosts, their presence is confined to the upper airway and does not cause any clinical manifestations. It is likely that acquisition of these pathogens in a patient with COPD, because of compromised lung defense, allows establishment of infection in the lower respiratory tract, with or without overt clinical manifestations.",

            "text": "Our understanding of acute exacerbation pathogenesis, especially in relation to bacterial infection, has seen significant progress over the last few years. Both host and pathogen factors are involved in development of acute bacterial exacerbations (Figure 1). Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment appears to be the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation (Sethi et al 2002). Variations among strains of a species in the surface antigenic structure, as is seen with NTHI, S pneumoniae and M catarrhalis allow these newly acquired strains to escape the pre-existing host immune response that had developed following prior exposure to other strains of the same species of bacteria. These strains can therefore proliferate in the lower airways and induce acute inflammation in the airways. The virulence of the strain and as yet unidentified host factors may determine if the acute inflammatory response to the pathogen reaches the threshold to cause symptoms that present as an exacerbation (Chin et al 2005). In many instances, the adaptive immune response results in development of mucosal and systemic antibodies to the pathogen (Sethi et al 2004; Murphy et al 2005). This immune response, in combination with appropriate antibiotics, is able to eliminate or control proliferation of the infecting bacteria. However, because of antigenic variability among strains of these bacterial species, the antibodies that develop to the infecting strain are usually strain-specific, and do not provide protection to the host from other antigenically distinct strains of the same species. This allows the process of recurrent bacterial infection and exacerbations in these patients.",

A common cause of exacerbations, the rhinovirus, demonstrates considerable antigenic variation among its more than 100 serotypes, allowing for recurrent infections. The influenza virus demonstrates drift in the antigenic makeup of its major surface proteins, thereby leading to recurrent infections. In vitro, viruses can damage airway epithelium, stimulate muscarinic receptors, and induce eosinophilic influx by stimulating the secretion of RANTES (Johnston et al 1998). These pro-inflammatory actions could potentially induce the pathophysiological manifestations that characterize acute exacerbation when a viral agent infects the lower airway of a patient with COPD.

These include our new understanding of the importance of exacerbations in the course of COPD, the role of infection in exacerbations, the high rates of relapse with an adequate initial clinical response, and the role played by chronic infection in the pathogenesis of COPD. To draw an analogy, confining our goal in the treatment of COPD exacerbations to short term resolution of symptoms would be the equivalent of treating acute myocardial infarction with the only aim being resolution of chest pain. Several other important goals of treatment, both clinical and biological, should be considered (Table 3). For instance, clinical success in the treatment of exacerbations has been defined as resolution of symptoms to baseline or improvement of symptoms to a degree that no further treatment is required in the opinion of the treating physician. If symptoms do indeed correlate with exaggerated airway and systemic inflammation, then acceptance of clinical improvement rather than clinical resolution has important implications. Clinical improvement may reflect inadequate treatment, permitting the inflammatory process that underlies the exacerbation to persist for prolonged periods of time (White et al 2003). Therefore, clinical resolution of symptoms to baseline may actually represent the optimal outcome.",

Furthermore, the benefit with antibiotics is more marked early in the course of the exacerbation, suggesting that antibiotics hasten resolution of symptoms (Allegra et al 2001; Miravitlles et al 2001). However, there are still important unresolved questions regarding the role of antibiotics in exacerbations. The benefit of antibiotics in mild exacerbations is unproven and warrants a placebo controlled trial. Whether antibiotics are of benefit in the treatment of exacerbations when a short course of systemic corticosteroids are co-administered has still not been studied in a large well designed trial. One would suspect that there would be additive benefits when both treatments are used over either treatment alone (Wood-Baker et al 2005; Ram et al 2006).",

As most exacerbations nowadays are treated without obtaining sputum bacteriology, this initial empiric choice often becomes the only choice made for antibiotic use in exacerbations. Results of antibiotic comparison trials should guide the recommendations for appropriate empiric antibiotics in exacerbations. However, though a large number of such trials have been conducted, in the vast majority, antibiotic choice does not appear to affect the clinical outcome. Differences in bacteriological eradication rates are seen, with an apparent dissociation between clinical and bacteriological outcomes (Obaji and Sethi 2001). This is contrary to expectations that antibiotics with better in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy and better pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics should show superiority in clinical outcomes. This paradox is likely related to several short-comings in design of these trials (Table 5) (Sethi 2004b). Many of these deficiencies are explained by the fact that these trials are performed for regulatory approval of the drugs, therefore are designed for demonstrating noninferiority rather than differences between the two antibiotics.",

In this time period, the primary outcomes were the rate of repeat exacerbations, hospitalizations for respiratory disease and health-related quality of life measures. Gemifloxacin was associated with a significantly lower rate of repeat exacerbations, with 71% of the gemifloxacin-treated patients remaining exacerbation free at 26 weeks in comparison to 58.5% in the clarithromycin arm. The relative risk reduction for recurrence of exacerbation was 30%. The rate of hospitalization for respiratory tract illness in the 26 weeks was also lower in the gemifloxacin-treated patients than in the clarithromycin treated patients (2.3% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.059) (Wilson et al 2002). Patients who had a recurrent exacerbation in the 26 week period had a lesser improvement in their health-related quality of life when compared to those who remained free of recurrence (Spencer and Jones 2003). This trial clearly demonstrates the limitation of the conventional medium-term clinical outcomes to demonstrate differences among antibiotics in exacerbations.

Some of these risk factors are likely to be highly correlated to each other, such as home oxygen use, hypercapnia and chronic steroid use likely reflect increasing severity of underlying COPD. Acute bronchodilator use could be related to the severity of underlying COPD or reflect the wheezy phenotype of exacerbation that may be less responsive to antibiotic treatment. Many of the risk factors discussed above are continuous in severity, however, certain thresholds have been defined in studies that are clinically useful and predictive of poor outcome. These include an age of more than 65 yrs, FEV1 less than 50%, and more than 3 exacerbations in the previous 12 months.",

Presence of sputum purulence has been advocated as the sole determinant for antibiotic treatment of exacerbations.

The best studied biomarker of bacterial infection is serum procalcitonin level. In a recent study in patients hospitalized for exacerbations, antibiotic treatment was only prescribed if the procalcitonin level was above a certain threshold. The investigators showed no difference in outcomes in spite of reduction in antibiotic use from 72% to 40% with procalcitonin guidance (Stolz et al 2007). Though the findings of this study are very interesting, this approach needs to be validated in multi-center trials with varied populations (Martinez and Curtis 2007). Furthermore, it needs to tested in outpatients with exacerbations, where the majority of exacerbations are treated, patients are not as closely supervised and other supportive care is less rigorous. Only a minority of patients received a fluoroquinolones in this study, which should have been the antibiotics of choice in these complicated patients, as per the risk stratification discussed above. Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that withholding antibiotics that may not be effective in the first place is likely not to have much of an impact. In this study, short term goals as well as biologic goals of bacterial eradication and inflammation reduction as discussed above were also not recorded.",
