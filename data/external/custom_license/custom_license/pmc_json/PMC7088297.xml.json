The genus Fasciola includes two species, F. hepatica and F. gigantica, the former of which is distributed worldwide and the second of which is restricted to several regions of Africa and Asia (Mas-Coma et al. 2009). The broad distribution of F. hepatica seems to be associated with its ability to adapt to new definitive hosts (Robinson and Dalton 2009) and with its capacity to infect different snail species (intermediate hosts) living in diverse habitats and under different environmental conditions (Correa et al. 2010).",

Finally, the parasites move into biliary ducts where they mature and begin producing eggs. Nevertheless, sometimes a small proportion of parasites reaches ectopic locations (Mas-Coma et al. 2013, 2014), thus preventing elimination of the eggs through the biliary ducts. Considering the characteristics of the biological cycle of Fasciola, diagnosis of infections by either F. hepatica or the more pathogenic F. gigantica (Valero et al. 2016) has traditionally been carried out by microscopic observation of parasite eggs in fecal samples from infected hosts (Mas-Coma et al. 2014). However, these methods are tedious, have poor sensitivity, and depend to a greater or lesser degree on the experience of the examiner. Moreover, fecal examination cannot detect acute infections when the parasites feed on liver parenchyma, before egg production has started (Charlier et al. 2014; Mas-Coma et al. 2014).",

            "text": "In the past two decades, considerable effort has been made to develop rational ELISA methods for the diagnosis of human and animal infections caused by F. hepatica and F. gigantica in order to prevent the limitations inherent in microscopic examination of fecal samples (Espino and Dumenigo 2003). Such methods include the use of whole or purified natural antigens from Fasciola as well as recombinant antigens, to detect anti-Fasciola circulating antibodies (Cornelissen et al. 1999; Carnevale et al. 2001b; Espinoza et al. 2007; Mezo et al. 2007; Gonzales Santana et al. 2013; Gottstein et al. 2014). They also include ELISA methods capable of detecting secreted antigens present in serum or fecal samples from infected humans and animals (Espino and Finlay 1994; Abdel-Rahman et al. 1998; Mezo et al. 2004; Ubeira et al., 2009; George et al., 2017). Because antibody titers may remain elevated for long periods of time after treatment of the infection, ELISA methods for the detection of specific antibodies cannot distinguish between current or past infections. Nevertheless, these ELISAs offer the advantage of being able to diagnose early prepatent (acute) infections (Salimi-Bejestani et al. 2007; Mezo et al. 2010a,b; Mas-Coma et al. 2014), and, for this reason, they are frequently used to screen herds of domestic animals in serum and mostly in milk samples (Mezo et al. 2010b; Duscher et al. 2011; Mezo et al. 2011). Most of these methods are indirect or capture ELISAs that include Fasciola cathepsins L (CLs) as antibody targets, as these antigens probably induce the highest proportion of anti-Fasciola antibodies during natural infections. However, except for ELISAs based on the use of single recombinant CLs (rCLs) or recombinant procathepsins L (rpCLs), typically L1 clade members, the suitability of each of the several cathepsins secreted by Fasciola for detecting anti-Fasciola antibodies by ELISA has not previously been investigated. This aspect is relevant, as it has been reported that the pattern of cathepsins that are secreted by F. hepatica varies during its biological cycle, so that immature parasites begin producing FhCL3, FhCL4, and cathepsins B, but that expression is gradually replaced by FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5 in adults (Robinson et al. 2008; Smooker et al. 2010; Cwiklinski et al. 2015). Moreover, production of these FhCLs by adult flukes has been reported to be imbalanced, with proportions of 69, 22 and 9% for FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5, respectively (Robinson et al. 2009). It is therefore important to determine which of these molecules are most relevant from the point of view of their antigenicity and suitability as target antigens for serodiagnosis of human and animal infections by Fasciola. In the present study, we developed and tested indirect ELISAs based on recombinant procathepsin L1 (rFhpCL1), rFhpCL2, or rFhpCL5, in order to investigate which of these targets are best recognized by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with F. hepatica. We also evaluated if any of these rFhpCLs is advantageous over the use of native CLs using as reference method of this study the MM3-SERO ELISA, in which the monoclonal antibody (mAb) MM3 captures native Fasciola CLs (Mezo et al. 2007).",

At each visit, 15 adult cows (over 2 years old; Friesian breed, females) were selected at random, and their livers as well as stool and blood samples were collected and transported to the laboratory promptly. In total, samples from 100 naturally F. hepatica-infected and 200 F. hepatica-free adult cattle, as determined, respectively, by the presence or the absence of flukes in livers (gold standard), were collected. For recovering and counting all flukes, each liver was thoroughly examined. In the first step, we proceeded to the opening of the bile ducts and the gallbladder to obtain the most of intact adult flukes and then the livers were cut into slices (approximately 1 cm thick) which were manually squeezed to obtain the immature flukes inhabiting the parenchyma. This procedure prevented any possible problems of low sensitivity when liver inspection is not performed thoroughly, as has been described in previous studies (Rapsch et al. 2006; Charlier et al. 2008).",

The different rFhpCLs were refolded as previously described (Mui\u00f1o et al. 2011) with a few modifications. Briefly, each elute from the affinity column was pretreated with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and subsequently diluted at a ratio of 1/10 in TBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8) plus 10 mM cysteine, 1 mM cystine, and 1 mM EDTA. Once dialyzed against TBS (pH 8), each rFhpCL was dialyzed against PBS and concentrated by membrane-filtration in an Amicon-stirred ultrafiltration cell equipped with a Filtron Omega Series membrane (10 kDa nominal molecular weight limit; Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY).

The displayed sequences corresponded to the full-length propeptide (residues S1-R/L91) lacking the deduced signal peptide (residues 1\u201315). The alignments revealed a high percentage of sequence identity among the three FhpCLs, although the percentage of identity was higher between FhpCL1 and FhpCL5 (87%), in comparison with the 84% calculated for FhpCL2 and FhpCL5, and the 78% for FhpCL1 and FhpCL2. Assignation of the sequence gb|CCA61803.1 to FhCL1 was previously reported (Mui\u00f1o et al. 2011). Regarding the sequence gb|KY464953, we observed that it differs by three nucleotides, but only by one residue (L52S), from sequence gb|ABQ95351.1 (Baspinar et al. unpublished results) and by seven nucleotides, which translate into five residue changes (L52S, F86Y, N110D, P149T, L152F), from the sequence gb|AAC47721.1 (Dowd et al. 1997), both of which were classified as FhCL2. Interestingly, these three sequences totally coincide with the key residues Y69, M70, A135, L160, T161, A163, and L209 (mature protein numbering) reported by Norbury et al. (2012) as being typical of the FhCL2 clade. The sequence gb|KY392883 was classified as FhCL5 because of its similarity to the sequence gb|AAF76330 reported by Smooker et al. (2000) and classified as FhCL5 by Norbury et al. (2012). Our sequence has four nucleotide changes, two of which translate into two amino acid substitutions (I263T and M295T), relative to gb|AAF76330.

As indicated in the previous section, the optimal concentration of the target antigens was determined in ELISA plates by their recognition by mAb MM3, which binds to an epitope that is present in the three FhCL clades. Moreover, as the MM3 epitope is conformational in nature (Mui\u00f1o et al. 2011), their recognition by this mAb in ELISA strongly suggests correct folding of these recombinant molecules. The results presented in Fig. 2a (Fasciola-infected) and Fig. 2b (Fasciola-free) show the individual IgG antibody response of the 33 and 22 cows, respectively, to the three recombinant cathepsins in indirect ELISA, and to native cathepsins in capture ELISA (MM3-SERO). Most of the sera from Fasciola-infected cows produced OD signals higher than 0.5 to the three rFhpCLs although, considering the samples individually, the antibodies in some sera displayed a preference for certain rFhpCLs. For example, this was the case with serum #5, which reacted preferentially with rFhpCL5 and rFhpCL1, and serum #15 which produced the highest OD value with rFhpCL2. Finally, only two serum samples (#14 and #29) produced low responses with \u2264 0.25 OD (Fig. 2a). With respect to sera from Fasciola-free cattle (Fig. 2b), unlike for the ELISA MM3-SERO, several serum samples produced high backgrounds in indirect ELISA, with OD values \u2265 0.1. The highest background values were obtained with rFhpCL1 (sera #10, #17, and #19) and with rFhpCL5 (sera #10, #15, and #21), although one sample (serum #22) also produced a considerable background (OD > 0.2) with rFhpCL2.",

In these figures, the corresponding cut-offs, calculated as the maximum OD value from negative sera plus one SD (method A) or obtained by ROC analysis (method B) are represented, respectively, by horizontal dashed red and blue lines. The sera from infected cattle produced similar mean OD signals (p > 0.05 for all comparisons), ranging from OD = 0.177 to OD = 2.398 for rFhpCL1-ELISA, from OD = 0.192 to OD = 2.268 for rFhpCL2-ELISA, from OD = 0.186 to OD = 2.673 for rFhpCL5-ELISA, and from OD = 0.254 to OD = 2.238 for MM3-SERO ELISA (Fig. 4a). However, due to the big differences observed between the cut-off of the reference test MM3-SERO ELISA (OD = 0.043) and the calculated cut-offs for the indirect ELISAs (OD = 0.632, 0.310, and 0.597, respectively, with method A, and 0.265, 0.265, and 0.285, respectively, with method B) several positive sera were incorrectly classified by these latter. Specifically, n = 4, n = 1, and n = 4 sera from infected cattle were misclassified by rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 ELISAs, respectively, considering the cut-off obtained by method A, while n = 2, n = 1, and n = 2 of these sera were incorrectly classified using the cut-off obtained by method B (ROC analysis). These results yielded sensitivity values of 87.9, 97.0, and 87.9%, respectively, considering the former cut-offs (method A), and sensitivities of 93.9, 97.0, and 93.9%, respectively, considering the latter cut-offs (method B). Although the sensitivity values of the rFhpCL1 and rFhpCL5 ELISAs obtained using cut-off values calculated with ROC curves (method B) are apparently better than those obtained with method A, it is relevant to consider that this increase in sensitivity was done at expenses of lowering the specificity of the assays by about 5% (see Table 2).",

For this purpose, we evaluated the presence of IgG antibodies reactive with a recombinant A. simplex allergen (rAni s 1) expressed in E. coli and purified using the same procedure as for rFhpCLs, or reactive with mouse IgG1 (purified mAb MM3 without F. hepatica antigens, which is used as control for each individual serum in the MM3-SERO ELISA). A relevant proportion of sera from cattle infected with F. hepatica had IgG antibodies reactive with rAni s 1, three of which produced OD signals above 1.0 (see Fig. 5a). Although the reactivity of sera from the Fasciola-free population of cattle was much lower (Fig. 5b), these samples still showed a notable reactivity to rAni s 1 (Fig. 5b). Moreover, anti-mouse IgG1 cross-reactivity was also observed for a significant number of sera within the samples from Fasciola-infected and Fasciola-free cows (Fig. 5e, f). On the other hand, regarding serum samples from sheep, the population infected with F. hepatica did not recognize the rAni s 1 (Fig. 5c) allergen, and only two serum samples from non-infected sheep produced OD values > 0.2 (Fig. 5d). Also, no reaction to mouse IgG1 antibodies was observed when testing sheep sera from both populations (Fig. 5g, h).",

These molecules were selected since (i) they are produced by adult flukes and thus continue stimulating the immune system during the chronic phase of the illness, and (ii) Fasciola cathepsins L1, L2, and L5 contain a common epitope recognized by mAb MM3, which is the capture antibody in the MM3-SERO ELISA (Mezo et al. 2007). Although rFhpCLs from the L1 clade have already been successfully used to develop a very sensitive and specific lateral flow test for immunodiagnosis of human fascioliasis (Mart\u00ednez-Sern\u00e1ndez et al. 2011), as well as to design ELISA tests for human (O'Neill et al. 1999; Carnevale et al. 2001a, b; Gonzales Santana et al. 2013; Gottstein et al. 2014) and animal use (Cornelissen et al. 2001; Kuerpick et al. 2013; Selemetas et al. 2014; Bloemhoff et al. 2015), the performance of rFhpCLs from L2 and L5 clades as ELISA targets has not previously been investigated. From a functional point of view, a single amino acid substitution may be sufficient to affect substrate specificity in cysteine proteases from F. hepatica (Smooker et al. 2000). The comparison of the new FhpCL2 (gb|KY464953) and FhpCL5 (gb|KY392883) sequences described in the present study with other reported cathepsins L2 (gb|ABQ95351.1; gb|AAC47721.1) and L5 (gb|AAF76330) revealed some nucleotide and amino acid changes. However, as none of the amino acid changes were in the positions referred by Norbury et al. (2012) as being typical of the Fasciola L2 and L5 clades, the assignation of our recombinant molecules as FhpCL2 and FhpCL5 was probably correct.",

The results showing preferences in procathepsin recognition in the population of sera from Fasciola-infected animals, mainly cattle (see Fig. 2a), are consistent with this hypothesis. More importantly, our results indicated that indirect ELISAs based on rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 show differences in sensitivity, despite the fact that the target antigens were expressed and purified in the same way. Specifically, considering the OD values obtained with the different immunoassays, the cut-off values calculated to maximize specificity (method A), and the number of false negatives obtained for each rFhpCL, the rFhpCL2 might be a better target antigen than the other rFhpCLs. However, the MM3-SERO ELISA had a better performance, as this method classified correctly all samples from sheep and cattle. There are at least two explanations for the superiority of the MM3-SERO ELISA over the ELISAs based on the use of individual rFhpCLs: (i) mAb MM3 is able to virtually capture all native cathepsin isoforms of the CL1, CL2, and CL5 clades from Fasciola (Mui\u00f1o et al. 2011; and this study), including those from the more pathogenic F. gigantica species (Valero et al. 2009; Valero et al. 2016). This may explain the fact that OD values obtained in MM3-SERO ELISA tended to be higher than in indirect ELISAs among infected animals with low anti-Fasciola antibody levels (see Fig. 2a), and (ii) the MM3-SERO ELISA includes an individual control for each serum, which ensures that particular animals with anti-species cross-reactive antibodies or antibodies against other irrelevant proteins present in the ELISA plate (see Fig. 5e, f) can be easily detected, thus allowing this signal to be subtracted from that of the corresponding positive well. Consequently, good OD signals and low backgrounds (which translates into lower cut-offs) are normally achieved, yielding an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, for both cattle and sheep sera. These results suggest that the use of a single recombinant cathepsin/procathepsin as target antigen in ELISAs for serodiagnosis of fascioliasis may limit the sensitivity of the assay when testing sera from some species, particularly cattle.",

However, considering that representatives of all mature Fasciola CLs are captured in MM3-SERO, the high backgrounds obtained with the rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 antigens for Fasciola-free cattle (see Fig. 2b) may appear unexpected at first sight. Moreover, this phenomenon was not limited to the samples investigated in this study, nor to the expression of rpFhCLs in E. coli. In agreement with this, a similar finding was recently reported in a study where the performance of an indirect ELISA based on a rFhpCL1 expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris was compared with that of a commercial indirect ELISA test containing a purified fraction from Fasciola ESAs (f2 antigen; Institute Pourquier, Montpellier, France) (Kuerpick et al. 2013). Cross-reactivity was also observed by Cornelissen et al. (2001) who tested sera from sheep and cattle harboring other parasites, mainly nematodes, suggesting that the cross-reactivity may be due to common epitopes between recombinant Fasciola cathepsins and antigens present in other parasites. However, as such cross-reactivity did not occur with the three tested rFhpCLs (see Fig. 2b), this explanation seems unlikely.",

            "text": "Another possible source of cross-reactivity is that rFhpCLs produced in E. coli were contaminated by bacterial proteins retained in the IMAC column during the affinity purification process. Coelution of native E. coli proteins (e.g., proteins containing clusters of histidine residues) with recombinant proteins is a recognized feature, mainly when recombinant proteins are expressed at low level (Robichon et al. 2011). However, this seems also unlikely for several reasons: (i) rFhpCLs are produced as inclusion bodies, and contaminating proteins are removed during the washing procedures before denaturation and subsequent IMAC purification of rFhpCLs; (ii) as indicated above, the reactivity of a particular serum does not occur with the three rFhpCLs, despite the fact that all of them were produced and purified following the same procedure; and (iii) preincubation of the cross-reactive sera with a bacterial extract prior to the incubation in ELISA plates, or the use of a rFhpCL1 expressed with a second tag in order to eliminate possible remaining contaminants in a capture ELISA did not eliminate the observed backgrounds (data not shown). Conversely, we hypothesize that the phenomenon may be related to a greater opportunity of cross-reactive antibodies to bind non-specific linear epitopes present in rpFhCL preparations than in native CLs. While in native antigens, the availability of non-specific linear epitopes may be low due to the correct folding of the protein, such epitopes may be exposed for antibody-binding when truncated, partially folded, or unfolded molecules are present, as occurs frequently when recombinant proteins are overexpressed in bacterial or yeast cell systems (Lilie et al. 1998; Cornelissen et al. 2001). In addition, an unexpectedly high number of samples from Fasciola-infected and non-infected cattle reacted with a recombinant form of the A. simplex Ani s 1 allergen (Fig. 5a, b), an antigen that is present in a fish parasite never naturally in contact with cattle, or with other herbivorous animals (Anad\u00f3n et al. 2010). Such allergen is structurally related with Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors (Audicana and Kennedy 2008). Thus, with respect to Fasciola-infected cows, it could be hypothesized that cross-reactivity with rAni s 1 is due to the presence of common epitopes between this allergen and the Kunitz-type molecules secreted by Fasciola (Bozas et al. 1995; Di Maggio et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2016). Nevertheless, the fact that the response was irregular among these cows, and that it also occurred, to a lesser extent, among Fasciola-free cows, suggests again that cross-reactive antibodies may be induced against antigens not related with Fasciola but which share some linear epitopes.",

Besides, there is also experimental data suggesting that cross-reactivity may not occur in the same way in different host species. In this sense, we observed that the OD responses to rFhpCLs were more homogeneous in infected sheep than in cattle (see Figs. 3a and 2a, respectively), which was also reflected by the higher r values obtained for sheep sera relative to cattle sera, when comparing the OD values obtained on testing the different rFhpCLs (see Table 3). Moreover, interspecific differences in the generation of cross-reactive antibodies to Fasciola procathepsins can also be deduced from a previous study in which no cross-reactivity was observed for human sera in a lateral flow test based on the same rFhpCL1 (Mart\u00ednez-Sern\u00e1ndez et al. 2011) used in the present study. This reflects that some species may be more prone to induce cross-reactive antibodies than others or that the antigens to which humans are exposed have fewer common epitopes with Fasciola CLs than those to which ruminants are exposed.",

Finally, although liver necropsy and coproantigen detection may not be perfect gold standards, since some animals may only have migrating or ectopic flukes, considering the age of cattle in our study (4\u201312 years old), the probability of having a single contact within the previous weeks before slaughtering is minimal.",
