The Frenkel procedure became the corner stone of vaccine production for many years and paved the way for modern biotechnology as we know it.2 More recently, recombinant pox viruses have been generated for vaccination against heterologous pathogens, using vaccinia-vectors, expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein and Newcastle disease virus fusion and hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins, the first applications of genetically engineered vaccines.3",

Inactivated, or \u2018killed\u2019, vaccines consist of treated microorganisms that are unable to replicate; however, they do not elicit protein production in the cytosol and hence viral antigens cannot be presented by MHC class I molecules, thus cytotoxic CD8 T cells are not generated. Live-attenuated vaccines are generally far more potent educing a greater number of relevant effector mechanisms, including cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, these vaccines sometimes have residual pathogenicity,4 or a pathogenic virus strain may re-emerge by a further series of mutations.5 Subunit vaccines would be as effective as live whole organisms, inherently safer than vaccines based on whole organisms, but they are not strongly immunogenic, being particularly difficult to obtain MHC class I specific responses.6, 7, 8 The development of vaccines therefore remains an important goal of immunology. Moreover, there remains a need for further vaccines that can reduce the economic impact of disease in production animals.",

Therefore, the \u2018realistic\u2019 vaccine should provide greater than 90% efficacy in disease prevention within a few days up to a couple of weeks of a single administration. Furthermore, in order to reduce the cost of regular reimmunizations and ensure receipt of a complete vaccination schedule, this protection should be of long duration, and should use a minimal number of doses. Additionally, an \u2018ideal\u2019 vaccine would also stimulate mucosal immunity, since the majority of viruses enter via mucosal surfaces; thus, the \u2018perfect\u2019 vaccine should be designed to be delivered by mucosal routes, that is, intranasal or oral delivery is preferable. Vaccines also need to be safe and not cause any adverse side reaction, such as immunosuppression or interference with immunity to other vaccines given simultaneously. Finally, the vaccines need to be both genetically and thermally stable. Genetic stability must be present to ensure the absence of reversion of the live vaccine to the virulent organism which might cause disease; and thermal stability is critical since the maintenance of the cold chain is not always guaranteed from manufacturing to delivery. A very important desired characteristic is to have vaccines that can be delivered to animals at a very young age and stimulate immunity in the presence of innate, passive immunity.9, 10 Another very important criterion for an ideal vaccine in veterinary medicine is low cost; this is especially important in developing countries and for poultry vaccines, in which the vaccines must sell for a few cents a dose. Unfortunately, such ideal vaccines are rare in the veterinary field; additionally, there are still severe diseases with no effective vaccines.",

The genome is divided into early (E) and late (L) genes, expressed, respectively, before and after replication of the viral chromosome (Figure 1). E1 gene products are involved in the control of viral gene transcription, shut-off of cellular proteins and cellular transformation. The E2 gene codes for proteins involved in viral replication, including a DNA-binding protein involved in DNA elongation (E2A) and a DNA polymerase (E2B); E3 gene, dispensable for Ad replication, codes for proteins that interfere with the host immune response against virus infection; finally, the E4 genes are involved in the transition from early to late gene expression, the shut-off of host-cell gene expression, the viral replication and the assembly of the virion (see Russell18 and Imler20 reviews). First-generation vectors are usually deleted in their E1 and E3 regions; however, when production is performed on 293 cells, recombination between the left terminus of first-generation Ad vector and partially overlapping E1 sequences in the cellular genome may result in the generation of E1-positive, replication-competent Ad (RCA),25 a serious safety concern if nonreplicating vectors are desired. Second-generation vectors are replicative-defective Ad, which are further deleted in E2A, E2B or E4, showing reduced immunogenicity and RCA generation, but engineering of stable cell lines that complement these vectors can be cumbersome and lead to poor cell growth and viral titers.26",

However, the use of human Ad (HAd) as a vaccine delivery system in non-human animals is still limited. Since non-HAds are species specific, the development of animal-specific Ad as a vaccine delivery system would be a logical choice. Thus, Ads isolated from species other than man have generated increasing interest, in particularly: i)canine Ad (CAd), which has the ability to replicate and persist locally in the upper respiratory tract of puppies in the face of maternal-derived antibodies when administered via the intranasal route and use both depedent and independent coxsackievirus group B and Ad receptor (CAR) pathays to enter the cells;28, 31ii)avian Ad, the subject of numerous investigations, has a number of features that make them attractive to the poultry industry: ease of propagation, ease of administration (water, aerosol or injection) and a large range of serotypes that vary in virulence. Chicken embryo lethal orphan (CELO), classified as the type 1 fowl Ad (FAd), is the most studied vector. This virus, like other typical avian Ad, has a much larger genome than mammalian Ad. Despite its large scatter, it has never been associated with serious disease or economical losses in the poultry industry. It can be isolated from healthy chickens and does not induce clinical signs when experimentally inoculated in chickens. Also this virus use both dependent and independent CAR pathways to enter the cells;31, 32iii)porcine Ad (PAd), which, depending upon serotype, can be grown in the pig kidney, testis, retina, thyroid cells, human kidney, canine melanoma and calf kidney cells, do not require adjuvants for the induction of proper immune responses. Infection is generally sub clinical causing no adverse effects in producing pigs, with PAd also isolated from apparently healthy pigs. PAd is species specific having only been isolated from swine, reducing the possibility of its spread to other animal or man following administration. PAd could induce both systemic and mucosal antibody responses;33, 34 andiv)bovine Ad serotype 3 (BAd3), which, like PAd, do not require adjuvants for the induction of proper immune response, and has been used due to its lack of virulence. Moreover, experimental infections of calves with BAd3 failed to produce either clinical signs or gross lesions, but all animals seroconverted. The cell entry pathway of BAd3 is not well understood.30, 35",

The construction and characterization of the first replication-competent rCAd2 started recently. The genes that code for CDV HA28, 39 or fusion (F)28 proteins were inserted in two CAd2s and used as a candidate vaccine in puppies. It was reported that intranasal vaccination with a mixture containing 105.8 TCID50 of which rCAd2 provided an excellent level of protection in seronegative puppies, inducing almost complete protection. In contrast, intranasal immunization of puppies born to CDV and CAd2 immune dams failed to activate specific and protective immune responses. However, when the same puppies were vaccinated subcutaneously, significant seroconversion and solid protective immunity were triggered. Furthermore, a significant priming of memory responses was evidenced immediately after challenge, this constituting an efficient strategy to overcome both passive and active Ad-specific immunity in the dog.",

PrV is a highly neurotropic virus causing nervous and respiratory complications in pigs, the natural host, and in a variety of other animal species. Vaccination against AJD is widely practised with live attenuated or killed whole virus vaccines. However, neonatal immunization is often limited in the presence of maternally derived antibody, which inhibits the immune response against both vaccines.51 Recently, the use of rAd vaccines carrying individual PrV genes were constructed as a safe alternative. Glycoproteins gD, gB and gC of PrV were chosen on the basis of their role in eliciting a protective immune response against virus infection. It was shown that piglets vaccinated intramuscularly with 108.6\u2013109.6 TCID50/animal 1 day after birth, with replication-competent HAd5 harbouring these three genes, developed similar neutralizing antibody responses independently of the presence or absence of maternal antibodies and were partially protected against challenge 16 weeks later.52 For pigs that are slaughtered a few months after birth, one-shot vaccination at birth could provide protection of sufficient duration. Finally, two doses of 2 ml of clarified tissue culture supernatant containing 105.4 TCID50 of rPAd expressing the PrV gD gene were administered subcutaneously and showed to protect pigs after challenge. Postmorten, gross lesions of pneumonia were found in the lungs of pigs given a single dose of vaccine; the lungs of pigs given two doses were free from disease.33",

            "text": "Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, clinically acute, vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals including domesticated ruminants, pigs and more than 70 wildlife species. Pigs are recognized as a significant factor in the spread of the disease since a single pig releases as much aerosol virus as 3000 cattle in a short period of time.53, 54 The economic and social impact of FMD can be catastrophic when an outbreak occurs in FMD-free countries populated with immunologically naive animals. The current vaccine is a chemically inactivated preparation of concentrated infected cell culture supernatant. However, FMD-free countries generally prohibit its use because of the lack of an approved diagnostic test that can reliably distinguish vaccinated from infected animals. Moreover, current vaccines can induce a protective response only after approximately 7 days post vaccination; this is a critical issue in disease-free countries, where, in the case of FMD outbreaks, a rapid control in preventing the spread of the disease is crucial (see Doel2 for a review). Thus, there is a need to develop disease control strategies relying on more rapidly induced protection. Mayer et al55 developed a replication-defective HAd5 vector containing the capsid polypeptide P1 and the viral 3C protease coding regions, necessary for processing P1 to the capsid proteins VP0, VP3 and VP1, from the FMDV strain A12. They observed that vaccinated swine with 1 \u00d7 108 PFU/animal in PBS developed antibodies against FMDV structural proteins and an FMDV-specific neutralizing antibody response, which seems to increase slightly by boosting the swine with a second inoculation of 5 \u00d7 108 PFU/animal in PBS at 4 weeks post initial vaccination.56 This vaccination protocol was shown to offer a significant degree of protection to the pigs, as five of six pigs were completely protected, while the remaining animal had significantly reduced signs of disease. Later, Moraes et al57 showed that a single dose of 5 \u00d7 109 PFU/animal in PBS of a replication-defective HAd5 expressing the P1 coding region of FMDV strain A24 completely protected pigs against homologous challenge 7, 14 or 42 days after vaccination. Since efficacious vaccination is strain dependent and the infection with one serotype does not confer protection against another, HAd5 bicistronic vector vaccines have been developed,58 decreasing the cost for multivalent adenoviral FMD vaccines. For the construction of these vectors, the P1 capsid coding region for both A24 and O1 strains and the 3C protease coding region of A12 strain were used. However, the neutralizing antibody response after vaccination with 2.5 \u00d7 109 PFU/animal in PBS of the bicistronic vector was considerably lower than that induced by a commercial FMD vaccine or the monovalent Ad-A24 vaccine.57 Recently, a new strategy based on the fact that FMDV is highly sensitive to alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) have been developed using a replication-defective HAd5.59, 60 This strategy has been shown to completely protect pigs after vaccination with 109 PFU/animal when challenged 24 h later with virulent FMDV.",

Swine macrophage is the only cell type known to support PRRSV replication, making commercial production impossible. Direct contact between infected and naive pigs is the predominant route of PRRSV transmission. Moreover, pneumonia caused by PRRSV infection is more severe in young pigs compared to adults and may be complicated by concurrent bacterial infection.61 Gonin et al62 observed that PRRSV-infected pigs present circulating antibodies responsible for viral neutralization mainly directed against GP5, an envelope protein. Gagnon et al63 constructed a replication-defective HAd5 expressing the GP5 protein and used this recombinant virus to immunize pigs using two intradermal injections with 5 \u00d7 108\u20131 \u00d7 109 PFU/animal in a mixture containing 100 \u03bcl of PBS and 100 \u03bcl of poloxamer SP1017 at 0.02%. It was observed that following challenge given intranasally 14 days after the booster, pigs produced high antibody titers to GP5 protein. Moreover, vaccinated pigs presented specific immune memory which, following a subsequent PRRSV infection, resulted in a rapid clonal expansion of memory cells to the neutralizing epitopes of the authentic viral GP5 protein.",

Several attempts have been made to develop efficacious recombinant TGEV vaccines.65 The spike protein (S) was identified as the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies and it mediates binding of TGEV to its cellular receptor.66 Thus, HAd5 expressing the S protein was constructed and used to study the induction of antibodies providing protection in swine.67 It was observed that porcine serum, elicited by 109 PFU/animal in PBS of this recombinant, when mixed with a lethal dose of virus prior to administration to susceptible pigs, prevented the replication of virulent TGEV administered orally as virus\u2013antibody mixtures and fully protected swine from clinical signs and death. Moreover, the used dose did not produce any clinical symptoms in any of the more than 50 animals inoculated up to 10 weeks after inoculation,68 suggesting that this vector can be used as a live vaccine in swine without secondary complications associated with the vector. However, a PAd vector could be more effective than HAd. Thus, Tuboly and Nagy65 constructed a rPAd5 expressing the TGEV protein. It was observed that a single oral dose of 5 \u00d7 106 PFU/animal of the recombinant virus was sufficient to induce both a systemic and a local humoral immune response.65 Unfortunately, challenge experiments were not carried out.",

In pigs, influenza can occur either as an enzootic problem in a herd or, more commonly, as explosive outbreaks of ARD. Although rarely fatal, swine influenza can be of substantial economic impact.69 In addition, there is growing concern for the potential for synergistic infections with influenza and PRRSV. Beyond the impact of influenza for the swine industry, pigs are also very important in the global ecology of influenza A viruses in humans.70 SIV vaccines that are commercially available are inactivated, whole-virus or subunit vaccines. While these vaccines may decrease the incidence and severity of clinical disease, they do not consistently provide complete protection from virus infection. Two replication-defective HAd5 were developed as potential vaccines against SIV: rHAd5 expressing the influenza virus H3 HA71, 72 inducing predominately a subtype-specific humural immune response;73 and rHAd5 expressing the nucleoprotein (NP),72 a group-specific stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes for crossreactive immunity to all influenza A subtypes.74 It was observed that the immunization of mice with 5 \u00d7 108 TCID50/animal and pigs with 2 \u00d7 1010 TCID50/animal in PBS with the first recombinant, described above, developed high levels of virus-specific hemagglutination-inhibition antibody to SIV by 4 weeks post vaccination and the animals were partially protected.

A rHAd5 expressing the nucleocapsid C protein (p14), which is highly conserved among many different pestiviruses, to which BVDV belongs, was constructed and shown to induced both humoral and cellular immune responses after vaccination with 109 PFU/animal, in a mouse model.77 The E2 protein of BVDV, which is a major viral glycoprotein, was also used for mice immunization using the same vector and dose.78 A strong humoral immune response was detected as the presence of a strong memory response to the E2 protein. Both strategies used an inducer/promoter allowing the generation of rAd in which the production of the transgene may be toxic and permitting the control of the transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. Finally, a rBAd3 expressing BVDV E2 protein was constructed and shown to induce BVDV E2-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses after intranasal immunization with 107 PFU/animal of cotton rats.79 Despite the fact that mice immunized with recombinant fowl pox virus or with a DNA vaccine expressing E2 glycoprotein induced E2-specific immune responses, it was also observed that the neutralization titers were low.79",

Live attenuated and killed vaccines are partially effective in reducing the disease incidence and severity.76 The limitations with the existing vaccines have encouraged the development of alternative, cost-effective vaccination strategies such as recombinant live viral vector-based vaccines. Mittal et al81 developed the first replication-competent and -defective HAd5 carrying the gD glycoprotein gene from the BHV-1 envelope. They showed that both forms induced immunity in cotton rats after vaccination with 107 PFU/animal in PBS and no infectious BHV-1 virions were isolated from the trachea of these rats after challenge. The same strategy was used with a rBAd3 and tested in its ability to induce mucosal and systemic immune response in cotton rats82 and calves30 with success. More recently, newborn lambs were immunized with 2 \u00d7 109 PFU/animal of replication-defective HAd5 expressing the gD protein of BHV-1.83 Both humoral and cell-mediated gD-specific mucosal immune responses were detected in 1\u20134-day-old lambs after a single immunization and these responses were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those detected in 5\u20136 week-old lambs. Moreover, gD-specific maternal antibody did not significantly alter either mucosal or systemic gD-specific immune response. In addition, BHV-1 glycoprotein gC was also tested in its ability to induce protective immunity to BHV-1 in cattle by intranasal administration of 1010 PFU/animal using a replication-defective HAd5.84 However, it was observed that the highest BHV-1 neutralizing antibody titers were obtained with rHAd5 expressing the gD protein followed by the live vaccine.",

Although Ad has the advantage to be produced at high titers (1010\u20131011 PFU/ml),19 to obtain a good immune response in a large proportion of treated animals, particularly for mucosal vaccination, large doses and thus culture volumes are required. Further process development aiming at higher yields of product is clearly necessary. Improvements in volumetric production can be achieved by increasing the cell density at which cells can be infected without lowering the specific yield of the product; however, production of Ad vectors that maintain a high specific yield in batch operation is limited to cell densities in the range of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml; several approaches have been made in order to overcome this so-called \u2018cell density effect\u2019:88 Garnier et al89 demonstrated that medium replacement at infection and the addition of glucose at 24 h postinfection (hpi) together with periodical pH adjustments, allowed a sustained maximum specific productivity at 1.6 \u00d7 106 cells/ml whereas Nadeau et al,90 further improved this strategy by also adding essential amino acids at 24 hpi thereby stabilizing volumetric productivity at cell densities above 2 \u00d7 106 and below 3 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. Such results hint at the existence of substrate limitation and/or byproduct inhibition at high cell densities. At production scale, medium exchange will increase the cost of the final product, which is even more critical when this is to be used in the veterinary field. Perfusion mode operation has been attempted as a means to control the culture environment and remove toxic byproducts;24, 91 nevertheless, the cell-specific productivity could only be maintained by infecting cells at densities up to 3 \u00d7 106 cells/ml using high perfusions rates of two reactor volumes per day, at 2 days postinfection, a very costly proposition.24 In our laboratory, by understanding kinetics and metabolism of infection, typical cell concentration at infection have already been doubled and further improvements seem possible using a simple and nonexpensive fed-batch mode.",

Traditionally, laboratory purification of rAd was achieved using two rounds of cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient ultracentrifugation. However, CsCl density gradient method is not scaleable. Despite the fact that chromatographic purification is an expensive method, ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, metal chelate and size-exclusion chromatography have been evaluated for capture and purification of HAd5.92 Kamen and Henry24 developed a complex and expensive method for gene therapy application consisting of: (i) harvest of infected cells by continuous centrifugation, (ii) cell lysis by osmotic shock, (iii) DNAse treatment with centrifugal/conditioning, (iv) filtration, (v) anion-exhange chromatography, (vi) ultrafiltration/concentration and (vii) size exclusion chromatography. This protocol allows large-scale purification of Ad vectors with purity comparable to the CsCl gradient method; however, it dramatically increases the final product price, well beyond the reach of veterinary utilization. Introgen developed a method consisting of a single ion chromatography run, after concentration/diafiltration and nuclease treatment, with a total recovery of the virus product of 70%.93 In our laboratory, a protocol to purify HAd5 from the bulk harvested directly from the bioreactor after lysis (without a concentration step) using an ion exchange chromatographic step, ultrafiltration and a final polishing step with gel filtration is in progress with promising preliminary results.",

Unfortunately, government regulators can often become extremely cautious when confronted with new technology and they not always follow a strictly science-based assessment approach, which should be the only criteria for regulation of products. The regulatory issues governing the use of Ad vaccines on the farm and in the veterinary clinical are not yet well defined, although guidelines on live recombinant vector vaccines for veterinary use are available (EMEA/CVMP/004/04) in EU, while the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the UE and the code of US Federal Regulations Title 9 (9 CFR) are the main regulatory texts on animal veterinary vaccine production.",

To reduce or eliminate the problem of RCA, an E1-trasformed human cell line PER.C6 was constructed.95 PER.C6 was made by transformation of primary human embryonic retinoblasts with limited homology with viral sequences, expected to reduce or eliminate the emergence of RCA during virus amplification.",

On the other hand, for their practical use, there might be still some potential problems that must be overcome, for example, safety issues such as reversion of virulence or recombination with field-type viruses spread in the environment and genetic stability. The selection of a good viral vector as recombinant viral vaccine should be determined by the host range of the vector, safety consideration, replication properties, stability, the amount of foreign DNA, which can be inserted and the place where the primary immune reaction is induced by antigens expressed by the vector.",
