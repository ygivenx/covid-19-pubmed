However, in a substantial proportion of respiratory tract infections, no etiologic agent is detected, even when sensitive detection methods, such as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are used.

Some studies have reported that HBoV is also a seasonal virus [1, 4\u20136, 8]. In this study, the number of HBoV-infected samples varied monthly over the study period: one in April, June, or October; two in May; four in July; six in September; and 11 in November. This finding suggests that this virus is also frequently detected in the summer, supporting the data found by other authors [2, 3]. This fact could be the cause of the underestimation of the real impact of this virus in several reports.",
