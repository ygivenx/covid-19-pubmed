Influenza vaccine is poorly immunogenic within the first 6 months of transplantation and is therefore not considered to be recommended during this period. The patients' influenza vaccination data were not evaluated in the present study, but only 12 of the 41 patients (29.3%) acquired the infection after the 6 month of BMT and could have received influenza vaccine. Therefore, we could argue that oseltamivir, introduced early in the course of the infection (up to 48 h from initial symptoms), may have played a role in preventing influenza complications in the remaining 70% of the patients who certainly did not receive influenza vaccine.",
