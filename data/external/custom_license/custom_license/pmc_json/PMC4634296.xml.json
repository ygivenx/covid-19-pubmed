It has been postulated that there were seasonal variations in the transmission of pandemic influenza viruses during the 20th century, as they appeared to have had either a secondary or a tertiary wave of activity at the time of the historical influenza season.6, 7 The A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009\u20132010 also demonstrated a seasonal component to transmission early during the pandemic, in the Americas.8 For example, surveillance during April to August 2009 pointed to higher rates of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Southern Hemisphere temperate countries, where the pandemic began at the time that seasonal influenza activity was expected.5, 9, 10\n",

The study period included the 62 weeks from June 11, 2009, to August 10, 2010, coinciding with the official start and end date of the pandemic period, as stated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Our data sources included virological influenza data obtained by WHO in FluNet11 as well as regional and national laboratory surveillance Web sites (e.g., http://www.euroflu.org, http://www.nicd.ac.za/). We analyzed influenza virological data from countries that reported laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza results for \u226570% of weeks in the study period and that reported >120 positive A(H1N1)pdm09 samples during the study period. We obtained 2010 World Population Projections and population density by country.12 In addition, we categorized countries by income groups according to World Bank classifications (high income, upper\u2010middle income, lower\u2010middle income and low income)13 to identify whether income groups were equally represented in our study (trend test).",

We then graphed the weekly proportions for each country to help us visualize the countries' influenza activity. We used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to create smoothed curves of influenza activity for each country (Figure 1). Using the smoothed data, we determined the following parameters of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity for each country: week of first detection of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 specimens detected during the week of highest activity (peak activity), number of weeks from first A(H1N1)pdm09 detection until the week of peak activity (time to peak), number of weeks when 90% of A(H1N1)pdm09 specimens were detected (i.e., time encompassing the 5th and 95th percentiles of cumulative A(H1N1)pdm09 weekly proportion), and number of waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity during the study period. We defined a wave as the time period including an increase and subsequent decrease in A(H1N1)pdm09 activity and including a peak week of activity. A peak week was defined as a week during which the LOESS\u2010smoothed proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was higher than the week immediately preceding it and immediately following it, and when the weekly proportion was at least 1% higher than in the troughs on either side. For example, Costa Rica showed only one wave of pandemic activity (Figure 1); the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09\u2010positive specimens identified during the peak week (week 27) was 6\u00b77%, and it was 0\u00b75% during the trough week that followed (week 43). The smaller increases observed later in the study period did not meet the peak definition. This method helped us to avoid counting spurious fluctuations as peaks and was selected after evaluating a range of thresholds.",

The start of the historical influenza season was defined as the time encompassing the 6 weeks before the start of the influenza season and the first half of the season. The timing of country's historical influenza season (i.e., typical month of start and end of the season) was only known for a subgroup of countries (17 in temperate regions and 22 in tropical\u2013subtropical regions) based on data from a prior study.15 In the case of China, data from mainland temperate and subtropical regions, Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong SAR, were analyzed separately.",

The median number of weeks from first detection until peak week was 25 weeks (20\u201327 IQR) in countries where first detection occurred at any other time of the year (P < 0\u00b701). Three of 14 (21%) countries had more than one wave of A(H1N1)pdm09 where A(H1N1)pdm09 was introduced during the start of the historical influenza season, compared with 12 of 25 countries (48%) where it was introduced during any other time, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0\u00b717). There was no statistically significant association between peak activity and the median number of weeks between the 5th and 95th percentiles of A(H1N1)pdm09 weekly proportion, among countries where A(H1N1)pdm09 was introduced during the start of the historical influenza season compared with countries where it was introduced at any other time of the year (Table 2).",

            "text": "During the 2009\u20132010 pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was associated with latitude; specifically, our analysis demonstrated that temperate countries had higher intensity (higher median peak) but shorter duration of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity (fewer weeks between the 5th and 95th percentiles) than tropical\u2013subtropical countries. The positive correlation between peak activity and the proportion of cases within the 12\u2010week period around the peak demonstrates that countries with higher peak incidence had more concentrated waves overall. These findings are consistent with our initial hypothesis, as we anticipated that pandemic influenza would show similar behavior to seasonal influenza viruses and readily transmit, during a shorter time period, in temperate climate countries, and demonstrate less intense activity spread out over a longer period of time in tropical climate countries.",

These findings may explain why the median number of weeks from first A(H1N1)pdm09 detection until reaching peak week was longer in temperate climate countries, as 45 of 47 temperate countries in our study were in the Northern Hemisphere, and they were experiencing spring when A(H1N1)pdm09 was introduced (a time of year when influenza activity is low in these climatic regions). It is also consistent with our finding that countries where A(H1N1)pdm09 was introduced during the start of their historical influenza season had less time until peak A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was reached, and although not statistically significant, these countries also had lower probabilities of having a second wave of pandemic activity. As the timing of the historical influenza season corresponds to the time of year when the environmental, social, or biological factors responsible for influenza seasonality create a setting for enhanced influenza virus transmission,2, 3 we suggest that these factors might also have a role in the transmission of novel influenza viruses.",

The time from first identification of a novel influenza strain until it is detected in every continent can be weeks, and countries that are not in the epicenter of a pandemic should consider using this time to implement early interventions that may help further delay the spread of pandemic viruses, as recommended by WHO.16 Countries in temperate climates might need to plan for the highest levels of activity during the autumn\u2013winter (despite the fact that some might face an initial wave of activity close to the introduction of the pandemic virus); this is supported by findings from previous pandemics in countries like the United States., where peaks of activity occurred during the autumn/winter months.6, 7, 17 Countries in tropical climates can expect influenza activity to be spread out over a longer period of time, with no evident pattern in the timing of their peak activity. Other investigators have made efforts to use influenza information obtained through current surveillance systems along with morbidity and mortality data from previous pandemics to generate models that may help estimate the burden of a future pandemic.18 There were also several contributions from mathematical modeling during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic.19 Some models have even looked at the role of seasonality in previous pandemics as well as the potential role in future pandemics.20 Our findings suggest the potential utility of accounting for latitude and historical timing of the influenza season when modeling the behavior of pandemic viruses.",
