In temperate areas, RSV occurs seasonally from winter to early spring. In tropical and subtropical areas, there is less seasonal variation, and RSV outbreaks in the tropics may be associated with the rainy season.[19] RSV is a common cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections with a tendency to infect children more often than adults. Almost all children have had primary infection by the age of 2 years, with more severe disease seen in higher risk groups, including very-low-birth-weight infants, as well as children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease and immune deficiencies.[20] RSV is highly contagious and reinfection can occur at any point later in life as a result of incomplete immunity.",

            "text": "Although RSV is often considered a community-acquired infection, nosocomial transmission is also common. Hospital-acquired infection may occur for several reasons. HSCT and SOT recipients with RSV infection may have difficulty clearing the virus because of their immunosuppressed states, and therefore have prolonged periods of shedding.[26,27] These patients should be isolated but are often placed in close proximity to each other on dedicated wards. Therefore, they have opportunities to infect multiple other immunocompromised patients through environmental contamination or by infecting staff members who are then exposed to other patients. Taylor and colleagues[26] reported that during the 1995\u20136 season, there were ten cases of RSV at an HSCT unit in Bristol, UK. Of the nine RSV specimens that could be amplified, restriction enzyme analysis demonstrated that eight sequences were identical \u2014 the patients had become infected with the same strain of virus. This strain also differed from those found in patients hospitalised from the community, suggesting that RSV had been nosocomially acquired within this HSCT unit. In addition, during an RSV season, 15\u201320% of healthcare providers may shed RSV, with this figure increasing to 50% during community outbreaks.[28] Because of these factors, nosocomial transmission may be responsible for approximately 50% of all cases.[29\u201331]",

The six patients diagnosed early in their conditioning regimen all had symptoms prior to treatment but had delayed virological confirmation. Of the 34 patients who had their HSCT delayed, only one progressed to proven RSV pneumonia, compared with two of three patients in the group who did not delay HSCT. Given their findings, the authors recommended that physicians should strongly consider delaying transplantation in those patients with RSV infection and perhaps also in those patients with URTI symptoms (even prior to virological confirmation).",

Conventional culture detected only four of these cases, while none were detected using shell vial culture. A study by Weinberg and colleagues[39] found that multiplex PCR was more sensitive in detecting respiratory tract infections, particularly RSV B and PIV 1, in lung transplant recipients compared with viral culture, enzyme immunoassays and rapid shell vial detection tests.

In HSCT recipients with RSV pneumonia or LRTI, aerosolised ribavirin alone has not shown significant benefit, with mortality rates as high as 70% reported in the literature.[43] Boeckh and colleagues designed a randomised multicentre trial to study the effects of aerosolised ribavirin in HSCT recipients with RSV URTIs.[44] The authors reported that patients randomised to receive aerosolised ribavirin had a nonsignificant decrease in the rate of progression to pneumonia (one of nine patients in the ribavirin group vs two of five patients in the control group; p = 0.51) and lower 10-day viral loads (0.75 log10 copies/mL reduction versus 1.26 log10 copies/mL increase; p = 0.07) compared with patients receiving best supportive care. Although the findings are intriguing, it is difficult to make further conclusions given that the study was insufficiently powered as a result of slow patient accrual. In a phase 1 study by Lewinsohn and colleagues,[32] intravenous ribavirin had similar efficacy to aerosolised ribavirin. However, it was also associated with adverse effects, including haemolysis, significant enough to require drug cessation in two of ten patients. In contrast, Glanville and colleagues reported that lung transplant recipients with RSV who were treated with a combination of intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroids had excellent prognoses (0% mortality) and only experienced mild adverse effect profiles.[45]",

There are three types \u2014 influenza A, B and C \u2014 based on antigenic differences. Influenza is highly infectious, spreads through respiratory droplets, and epidemics typically occur during winter months resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Machado and colleagues[58] reported that 12% of influenza cases occurred during summer months in a tropical climate, although given the known potential for prolonged shedding and the limited ability to detect other viruses in their study, it is not completely clear that these represented true incident cases of influenza. Within a single influenza season, most cases will be of the same (major) strain, although other (minor) strains may also cause disease. However, antigenic changes in the virus, vaccine contents and population vaccine penetration, and antiviral use and resistance, lead to different circulating influenza strains each year. Several articles have noted infections in transplant patients with either influenza A or B,[58\u201360] but it is unclear in these small series whether there are substantive differences in clinical presentation or outcomes. Although influenza is commonly considered a community-acquired respiratory illness, nosocomial spread also occurs. Hospitalised HSCT or SOT recipients may become infected soon after transplantation, resulting in severe disease and worse prognosis.",

Recent longitudinal studies of HSCT recipients with symptomatic RTI identified rhinovirus in 27% of clinical isolates.[10,55] Progression to LRTI was observed in 17% of cases and two deaths from rhinovirus pneumonia were noted. Children may be particularly susceptible to rhinovirus, as one series noted 18% mortality in post-BMT patients with rhinovirus.[86] These patients underwent BMT for primary immunodeficiencies and therefore may represent a uniquely susceptible population. Many older DFA or IFA panels did not include rhinovirus in routine testing, so as newer diagnostic technologies (i.e. PCR) become more widely used, the true epidemiology and impact of rhinovirus infections in HSCT or SOT recipients will become clearer.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) are both rarely reported but potential pulmonary pathogens.[85] In the era of routine antiviral prophylaxis, these are especially rare pathogens in the first several post-transplant months. VZV may occur at any time post-transplant and dormant virus is ubiquitous in the population. Since most cases of VZV pneumonia in HSCT or SOT recipients are preceded by the characteristic vesicular skin rash,[88] and since VZV pneumonia is very rare, it is presumed that prompt antiviral therapy with aciclovir can halt the progression of reactivation disease to pneumonia.

Three studies examining the frequency of hMPV recovery from stored bronchoalveolar lavage specimens documented a positivity rate of 3\u20139% among transplant recipients with symptomatic RTI; while this rate may seem low, it is comparable to the observed rates for RSV, PIV and influenza.[94\u201396] Although it is difficult to calculate an accurate frequency of progression to pneumonia or death, these outcomes have been observed.[96] Furthermore, studies demonstrate that cases are clustered in epidemic fashion \u2014 whether these are community-based epidemics or nosocomial epidemics has not been firmly established, although some contribution of both is possible.[93] Debiaggi and colleagues[97] have published data which question the pathogenic role of hMPV in HSCT recipients, as many of their patients had detectable hMPV in nasal specimens without clinical disease. This highlights the need for further research in this area. No treatment is yet proposed for hMPV infection, and diagnosis is likely to be difficult because hMPV is not part of even many newer PCR-based panels for the diagnosis of viral infections. Regional laboratory experts should be consulted regarding the availability, feasibility and expense of routine or intermittent testing for this emerging pathogen.",

RSV, PIV, influenza A and B, and adenovirus are most often reported in the literature, with less information available regarding rhinovirus, coronavirus, herpesviruses and hMPV. Progression from URTI to LRTI occurs more often in immunocompromised patients, and once this occurs, is associated with higher complication and mortality rates. Early treatment is limited but should be considered when available. Preventative measures including vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis and appropriate infection control measures are also essential in decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with RTIs in transplant recipients.",
