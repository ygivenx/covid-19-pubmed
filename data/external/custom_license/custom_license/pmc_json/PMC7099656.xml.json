A wide range\nof impactful research in our field has focused mainly on nonenveloped human\nenteric viruses such as human noroviruses and enteroviruses. More recently, a\nnumber of high-profile outbreaks such as Ebola virus, measles, Zika virus, avian\ninfluenzas, SARS, MERS, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have been caused by\nenveloped viruses. In addition to the RNA or DNA genomes and protective protein\ncapsids that are common to all viruses, enveloped virus structures are also\nwrapped in bilipid membranes.",

Some enveloped viruses, however, are released to the\nenvironment by the host and persist on surfaces (i.e., fomites), in the air, or in\nwater, long enough to come into contact with another host for further onward\ntransmission (i.e., indirect transmission). This includes viruses responsible for\ninfluenza and measles. The primary transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus\nthat causes COVID-19) are believed to be person-to-person contact and by exposure\nto large droplets produced from sneezing, coughing or talking, but indirect\ntransmission routes may also play a role.1 This potential role\nof the environment in the spread of COVID-19 highlights the multitude of applied\nresearch needs that must be addressed to effectively control outbreaks and\npandemics as novel enveloped viruses emerge. Environmental engineers and\nscientists are well positioned to apply their unique skill sets and experience\nwith interdisciplinary research to address these needs.",
