            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease with severe inflammatory symptoms in joints, mostly in hands, feet, and knees [1]. RA affects approximately 1 % of the population, with high incidence in women and old people [2]. Abnormal accumulation of fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes in synovial joints finally causes the destruction of the bone and cartilage [3]. Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) are regarded as direct inducers of such damage. They receive molecular signals from macrophages and lymphocytes, and they secrete metalloproteinases (MMPs), IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) among others [4]. One of the most important upstream signals for RASFs is TNF, a highly expressed cytokine in both serum and synovium of RA patients [5].",

            "text": "TNF is a type II transmembrane homotrimer that is released in a soluble form through proteolytic cleavage by TNF-converting enzyme (TACE) [6]. Mainly secreted by synovial macrophages, TNF is considered to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, which causes intractable inflammation in joints. Infliximab, a TNF antibody, has already proved its effectiveness in treating RA patients [7]. However, with different cell types, various activation states, and a variety of microenvironment factors, TNF can contribute to either proinflammatory cytokine secretion or cell death [8]. The TNF receptor is known as one of the death receptors, and it can receive death signals given by TNF ligands and further induce caspase-dependent apoptosis or caspase-independent necroptosis (a type of programmed necrosis) [9]. The apoptotic rate of RASFs under TNF stimulation could be significant, because it could both decrease the number of effective RASFs and inhibit TNF-related immune activation. With two different downstream signaling pathways, NF-\u03baB-dependent or NF-\u03baB-independent cell survival versus caspase-related apoptosis [10], TNF signaling could be influenced by certain other important molecules that help to \u2018switch\u2019 between different patterns [11]. Although TNF has been studied for a long time, the mechanism underlying downstream-pattern preference is still unclear. Elucidating the TNF-related cell death pathway in synovioblasts should increase our understanding of RA and may suggest treatments.",

            "text": "CD147, also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and leukocyte activation-associated M6 antigen or HAb18G, is a transmembrane glycoprotein [12]. CD147 is a receptor for cyclophilin A (CypA) and PfRh5, and it contributes to tumor metastasis, inflammation, and pathogen (plasmodium falciparum and coronavirus) infection [13\u201320]. Our previous works have proven that CD147 is upregulated in RA synoviocytes, including RASFs and macrophage-like cells [21]. CD147 overexpression can increase MMP production and invasiveness in synoviocytes. In addition, CD147 on RASFs induces the upregulation of VEGF and HIF-1, which further promotes angiogenesis in synovium and causes persistence of synovitis [22]. CD147/HAb18 monoclonal antibody can inhibit cartilage erosion and synovitis in the SCID mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis [23]. However, so far, the role of CD147 in TNF-induced RASF apoptosis has not been studied. It was reported that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CD147 inhibits HCC cell apoptosis under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [24]. Others have shown that TNF is the key in the cross talk between ER stress and oxidative stress [25]. These data highlight the possibility that CD147 plays a negative role in TNF-related apoptosis.",

            "text": "TNF overexpression is a significant signature of RA. Detected in serum and synovial fluid, TNF is responsible for the immune activation of lymphocytes (both B and T lymphocytes), fibroblasts, endothelium cells, and macrophages through promoting the secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, which in turn cause intractable inflammation [28]. Infliximab, a TNF antibody, has already proven its effectiveness in treating RA patients. However, in other cases, TNF is also known as an inducer of apoptosis and necroptosis. Apoptosis is dominant in physiological cell death, which plays an important role in individual development [29] and in responding to mild stress. In contrast, necroptosis, a programmed type of necrosis, is more common under pathological conditions [30]. Unlike necrosis, apoptotic cells produce apoptotic bodies that can be removed quickly without further damage.",

The proper degree of RASF apoptosis, for one thing, can alleviate the bone and cartilage erosion by reducing the number of fibroblasts; for another, it can consume more TNF, which would otherwise cause extra immune responses. In our study, we found that TNF expression was not correlated with apoptotic rates between RA and OA synovial tissues, both of which remained at a relatively low level, and TNF only caused mild apoptosis in vitro. The key question is which TNF signaling pattern is preferred in RA synovium, the NF-\u03baB-dependent (or NF-\u03baB-independent) cell survival pathway or the caspase-related apoptosis pathway. The factors contributing to TNF signaling pattern preference include the concentration of TNF, the time course of TNF stimulation [31], and the expression of other important molecules. The high level and long duration of TNF expression in serum and synovium of RA patients have been proven in clinical studies [32\u201334]; nevertheless, little is known about the vital molecules that can switch TNF signaling between the different patterns.",

As a cancer biomarker, CD147 facilitates MMP production and increases the invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma [35\u201337]. Similarly, in RA synoviocytes, CD147 promotes the erosion of the bone and cartilage. Moreover, the overexpression of CD147 in RASFs results in angiogenesis in synovium. Even though there is no indication of CD147 in TNF-stimulated RASFs, it has been confirmed that CD147 inhibits HCC cell apoptosis under ER stress. On the other hand, TNF is significant in ER stress, suggesting that CD147 may be vital to protecting cells from TNF-stimulated apoptosis.",

Though previous study had testified the NF-\u03baB activating role of recombinant human CD147 (as an exogenous stimulation) in cardiomyocytes [38], we for the first time revealed that CD147 downregulation in RASF could inhibit the IKK transcription and protein expression, which demonstrated that CD147 could be a direct transcription factor of IKK or a regulator of other IKK transcription factors. The possible mechanism of such inflammatory activation and apoptosis resistance is CD147 that increases IKK transcription and protein expression, so that I\u03baB-RelA-NF\u03baB I complex is easier to be collapsed under TNF stimulation. As a result, in RA synovium, where there is a high level of TNF, the NF-\u03baB pathway of RASF is activated; meanwhile, the apoptosis pathway is blocked.",

In our research, the intracellular portion of CD147 is not related to synovioblasts apoptosis resistance. Although CD147 intracellular portion is detected in mRNA level, we could not exclude the possibility of unsuccessful protein expression.
