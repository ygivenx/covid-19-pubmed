However, behind the scenes, the meeting marked further progress in the group's assumption of responsibility for tackling global health problems. This attention is welcome \u2014 but the nature of the G8 forum and its exclusion of notable players, such as China, India and Brazil, carries risks.",

But the meeting reiterated its support for financing the Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and a host of other G8 health commitments, such as eradicating polio and making AIDS antiretrovirals available to all by 2010. There were no announcements of substantial new funding or initiatives, however.",

The spread of avian flu has exposed both the vulnerability of rich countries to diseases that emerge outside their own borders, and their lack of the vaccines or infrastructure needed to resist a human pandemic. In response, a G8 communiqu\u00e9 calls for better international cooperation on surveillance and monitoring, building infrastructure in affected countries, \u201cfull transparency by nations in sharing, on a timely basis, virus samples and other relevant information about the outbreaks of diseases\u201d and \u201cencouraging development of next generation influenza vaccines\u201d.",

Like the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, which has taken a prominent role in the global response to avian flu, it is underfunded and chronically understaffed in key departments.",
