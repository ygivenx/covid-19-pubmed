            "text": "Public health education is evolving rapidly in the United States and around the world. It is ironic that medicine and healthcare services dominate thinking and expenditures for health in the United States, since a broader concept of the social, economic, biological, and technological determinants of health and disease would treat health care as a variable within public health. When I became dean of the School of Public Health & Community Medicine at the University of Washington in 1982, there were 22 accredited schools of public health offering the Master of Public Health and related master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs and conducting research within the public health sciences. Now there are 48 schools, plus 76 institutions with accredited master\u2019s of public health programs in the United States. With greatly enhanced public and student interest in global health, many universities are introducing or expanding undergraduate courses in public health, including environmental health, nutrition and health, epidemiological surveillance of emerging infections, health policy, and behavioral and socioeconomic determinants of health. Internet communication is helping to democratize access to actionable knowledge in public health, including the SuperCourse of Global Health, launched by Ronald Laporte and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh (www.pitt.edu/~super1), a network of an estimated 65,000 scientists in 174 countries sharing at no charge 5000 lectures in 31 languages; we have now created an expanded SuperCourse of Science, housed at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt (Laporte et al. 2006).",

These processes are active early in development and influence phenotypes throughout the lifespan, maintaining or enhancing fitness on a timescale intermediate between selection and homeostasis. These manifestations of plasticity are acquired; some are reversible, others irreversible. These observations are matched at the molecular level by epigenetic modifications such as methylation of cytosines in the DNA and methylation, acetylation, and other modifications of histone proteins wrapped around the DNA in chromosomes. Plasticity and epigenetics link genes, development, and environment in the triangle of the determinants of phenotypes (Fig. 1). Exposures to chemical, physical, pharmaceutical, dietary, and microbial agents from environmental sources can affect in utero and postnatal development.",

            "text": "The protozoan parasite P. falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria, with more than one million deaths annually worldwide. Rates of malaria infection are correlated with the distribution of the obligate intermediate host, Anopheles mosquitoes that multiply in stagnant water, a situation driven by agricultural practices involving deforestation both historically and currently. The most obvious ways to avoid malaria infection are migration away from geographic areas with high prevalence of Anopheles and Plasmodium and elimination of the host with antimalarial chemicals such a dichlorodiphenyl\u2013trichloroethane (DOT), which was very effective globally before its ban because of adverse effects on bird populations. Malaria also is an outstanding example of ecogenetics, the interaction of environmental exposures with inherited susceptibility. Children and adults with hemoglobin S (sickle cell trait) have red blood cells less hospitable to the life stage of the malaria parasite that infects and propagates in the blood, compared with the red blood cells of individuals with normal HbA. HbS individuals are more likely to survive the infection and go on to reproduce, transmitting their genes to the next generations. This is natural selection in action. Allison (1954) deduced that malaria was the selective factor maintaining the HbS gene in populations in the face of high mortality from sickle cell anemia when individuals received a double dose of the gene (HbSS). HbC, HbE, beta thalassemias, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies fit this same pattern of \u201cbalanced polymorphisms\u201d (Motulsky 1964). A 20% increase in fitness for individuals with the trait could balance an 85% decrease in fitness of homozygous HbSS individuals (Gelehrter et al. 1998).",

For many years, the evidence seemed to point to co-speciation of P. falciparum in humans and Plasmodium reichenowi in chimpanzees, evolved separately from a presumed common ancestor over 5\u20137 Ma. That was based on a single isolate of P. reichenowi. Rich et al. (2009), with eight new isolates, showed that the global totality of P. falciparum strains is included within the much more diverse P. reichenowi variation. All extant P. falciparum populations seem to have originated from the parasite infecting chimpanzees by a single-host transfer about 10,000 years ago. Moreover, inactivation of the gene CMAH in the human lineage blocked conversion of the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (5Ac) to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), making humans resistant to P. reichenowi.",

International studies of blood group antigens on red blood cells revealed that West African populations had a Duffy-negative phenotype and Fy-/Fy- genotype, which are rare among Caucasian and Asian populations. Fy-/Fy- individuals are completely resistant to P. vivax infection because the Fy blood group antigen is the receptor through which the P. vivax parasite enters erythrocytes. Whether this infection is sufficiently life-threatening to fully account for the ubiquitous presence of Fy- in these populations is not resolved (Vogel and Motulsky 1997; Omenn 2010).",

            "text": "The Duffy mechanism was a clue to explain the epidemiological observation that some men very highly exposed to the HIV/AIDS virus did not become infected. The most striking specific mechanism involves a mutant CCR5 receptor on lymphocytes (a 32 amino acid deletion). CCR5 is an essential component of the entry mechanism for HIV; if there is no entry, there is no infection and there is no risk of transmission to others. We have no clue as to the natural selection driver for CCR5 mutations to accumulate in the human population (Heeney et al. 2006). We now know 20 polymorphisms of receptors, co-receptors, cytokine ligands, and HLA genes that influence susceptibility to HIV infection, replication, or relevant innate or adaptive immunity (Heeney et al. 2006). Viruses have a long history of co-evolution with molecules of the immune system. The presence of the CCR5 receptor seems to protect against West Nile virus; thus, we should be alert that development and public health use of inhibitors of CCR5 to reduce risk of HIV/AIDS could lead to increased risk of West Nile virus-induced encephalitis. Since the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s, public interest in the origins of the HIV viruses has been intense; there is now strong evidence that HIV-1 and HIV-2 evolved from chimpanzees and from sooty mangabeys, respectively. Also, the human genome has a large array of endogenous retroviral sequences, suggesting a long history of co-evolution with retroviruses.",

Microbes respond promptly to negative natural selection in the form of antibiotics by developing genetically transmitted resistance to the action of individual antibiotics or sets of antibiotics. Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to multiple drugs put healthcare workers at great risk; when these strains were recognized about 20 years ago, an aggressive public health campaign to identify and isolate such patients and ensure full dosage therapy with whatever agents still were effective contained the outbreaks. A similar challenge exists today with multiply resistant Staphylococcal aureus, acquired mostly in hospitals but increasingly in the community.

Catchy titles like \u201cStone agers in the fast lane\u201d (Eaton et al. 1988) set the stage. Food-processing procedures and different crops that were introduced during the Neolithic Period have altered fundamentally seven critical nutritional characteristics of ancient hominin diets: glycemic load, fatty acid composition, macronutrient composition, micronutrient density, acid\u2013base balance, sodium/potassium ratio, and fiber content (Cordain et al. 2005). Modern diets are dominated by dairy products, refined cereal grains lacking germ and bran, refined sugars (sucrose and fructose), vegetable oils with low \u03c9-3 and high \u03c9-6 fatty acids, alcoholic beverages, salt, and \u03c9-6 saturated, fatty acid-rich mammalian meats. These foods displaced the wild plant and animal foods of our predecessors. Cordain et al. call our diet \u201cthe evolutionary collision of our ancient genome with the nutritional qualities of recently introduced foods\u201d. This collision is manifested by many chronic diseases that dominate public health concerns: obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, high blood pressure, dyslipidemias, osteoporosis, several cancers, and bowel, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. All remain rare among contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer societies. Modern foods are also net acid generators, compared with net base-producing pre-agricultural diets; the latter tended to protect against osteoporosis, muscle wasting, calcium kidney stones, high blood pressure, and exercise-induced asthma (Frassetto et al. 2001).",

Milk contains casein protein, calcium salts, water, and lactose (galactose\u2013glucose disaccharide sugar). The ability to digest lactose declines rapidly in most humans after weaning because of a normal decline in the activity of the intestinal enzyme lactase. Before the drinking of non-human milk, there was no further need for this enzyme after weaning ended the dependence on mother\u2019s milk. Populations with a long history of cattle domestication and milk drinking selected for the \u201cpersistence of lactase\u201d trait. It is an interesting question which phenotype is \u201cnormal\u201d, intolerance or tolerance for lactose sugar after weaning. The prevalence of persistence of lactase (lactose tolerance) has reached >90% among northern Europeans (Swedes), \u223c50% in Spanish and Arab populations, 5\u201320% among African populations, and only 1% among Chinese and Native Americans.

A key element of normal cardiovascular function is hemostasis. For animals in the wild and for hunter\u2013gatherers, the risk of bleeding to death after an injury is a strong evolutionary pressure. Likewise, women experienced pressure to have greater hemostasis to survive pregnancy-related hemorrhages. Those individuals with more active hemostasis were more likely to survive to sexual maturity and pass on their genes (Coller 1997; Ding and Kullo 2009). At the same time, there was little selective pressure against excessive hemostasis and thrombotic disorders, since heart attacks and strokes occur typically after the active reproductive years.",

Platelets are deposited on damaged atherosclerotic plaques together with deposition of fibrin and thrombin and binding of a large protein called von Willebrand factor (vWf), collagen, and tissue factor, culminating in occlusive thrombus formation. The platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the luminal surface of the adherent platelets are activated and undergo a conformation change that enhances their binding of plasma fibrinogen, vWf, and other glycoproteins.",

It was safe and effective in reducing the risk of ischemic complications of atherosclerotic coronary and cerebrovascular disease (heart attacks, sudden death, and strokes). Coller (1997) emphasized that this drug is a leading example of rational drug design\u2014identifying adhesion molecules as therapeutic targets and then producing successive generations of effective inhibitors that meet the stringent safety standards for drug approval. The evolutionary pressure for life-saving hemostasis led to notable redundancy in our hemostatic systems; thus, treatments of patients with anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, or thrombolytic agents have excellent safety profiles. Moreover, this glycoprotein is expressed only in megakaryotypes (platelet precursors) and platelets, so it is truly a specific target. Reflecting the need for instantaneous response to hemorrhage, the density of GPIIb/IIIa receptors on platelet surfaces is about 80,000 copies per platelet less than 200 A apart, with an additional internal pool of receptors in alpha granules. These receptors are activated by molecular signals of vessel damage, followed later by a complex process of inactivation. A vast pharmacologic and clinical literature supports our understanding of this highly evolved, complex system of cell adhesion, responses to hemorrhage, and thrombotic and antithrombotic effects.",

The recognition of limited variation within haplotypes to identify recent positive selective pressure is illustrated with SNP 44 of Calpain-10, involved in regulation of blood glucose levels (Vander Molen et al. 2005). The sodium hypothesis, that sodium-conserving mechanisms conferred a survival advantage among human populations in the hot, humid climate of Africa, but then predisposed to high blood pressure in temperate climates, is well-supported. The newly-discovered regulator of the low-density lipoprotein receptor, PCSK9, has multiple interesting evolutionary features; it is also a prime target for new drug development.

Global average surface temperatures have increased 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) over the past century, mostly in the past 30 years, with a driver to further increases from carbon dioxide already accumulated in the atmosphere. We can expect an increasing focus on modeling and predicting coevolution of humans and many relevant plant, microbial, invertebrate, and vertebrate species under the selective forces of global climate change and our attempts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Geographic shifts with temperature and humidity will have major effects on agriculture, vector-borne diseases, and migrations of populations (Last 1993; Ebi and Semenza 2008). The Arctic is particularly susceptible to climate change, with warming occurring at a rate twice that of moderate zones, leading to striking changes in the forests and viability of crops, appearance of unfamiliar insects and microbes, and thinning and breakup of the arctic ice. We can anticipate progressive major changes in temperature, humidity, habitats, vectors, and transmission for a host of infectious agents. Seasonality is another important climate variable for infectious diseases, recognized since the time of Hippocrates. Seasonality produces alternating periods of high transmission and population bottlenecks that limit strain diversity and cause rapid genetic shifts. Models show that small seasonal changes in host\u2013pathogen dynamics, including host social behavior and contact rates, may be sufficient to create large seasonal surges in disease incidence, which are likely to become more extreme with climate change.",
