            "text": "Aging is characterized by an increased susceptibility to infectious diseases as the ability to fight new infections decreases, and latent infections re-emerge and increase in severity. Infections, such as influenza, pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Powers 1994; Treanor and Falsey 1999; Gavazzi et al. 2004), thus account for nearly one third of deaths in the aged population (Groen et al. 1998; Schildgen 2009). Alterations in the adaptive immune system, particularly the T cells, are thought to account for these age-related immune deficiencies. Studies have shown that aged subjects exhibit significantly lower CD8+ cytotoxic responses to influenza virus when compared with young subjects (Mbawuike et al. 1990, 1993; Powers and Belshe 1993; Christensen et al. 2000; Effros et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2009). Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 secretion from both CD4 and CD8 T cells also decreases with age (Powers and Belshe 1993; Castle et al. 1997; Kang et al. 2004). Although the decline in T cell immunity is considered a key factor in the increased susceptibility to infections in the elderly, the impact of aging on the innate immune system is not well understood (Pawelec et al. 1998; Solana et al. 2006). Since the innate immune system plays a crucial role in controlling pathogen invasion, and in instructing the adaptive immune system to initiate an antigen-specific response, it is important to determine the extent to which aging affects the innate immune responses.",

            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are innate immune cells that are key players in the establishment of an effective immune response against invading pathogens, particularly viruses. PDCs are present in the peripheral blood (0.2\u20130.5%) and secondary lymphoid organs and express the IL-3 receptor (CD123). They are characterized by their plasma cell-like morphology, low phagocytic capacity, and copious production of type I IFNs in response to viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (Cella et al. 2000; Liu 2005). A single cell is able to produce 1\u20132 IU of IFN in response to viral stimulus, an amount that is 10\u2013100 times more than most other cells. PDCs owe their ability to detect and respond to microbes to a specific repertoire of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TLR7 and TLR9 (Takeuchi et al. 2004; Ito et al. 2005; Seeds et al. 2006), which are located in the endosomes and recognize certain nucleotide motifs in viral and bacterial RNA and DNA (Hemmi et al. 2003; Diebold et al. 2004; Heil et al. 2004), respectively. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated 2\u2032-deoxyribo (cytidine\u2013phosphate\u2013guanosine) (CpG) DNA motifs (Hemmi et al. 2000) that are present at high frequencies in pathogens such as viruses and bacteria but are rare in vertebrates. TLR7 recognizes viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA; influenza) and imidazaquinolones (Hemmi et al. 2002). Unlike other receptors, TLR7 and TLR9 can sense inactivated viruses and thus do not require infection of PDC by viruses to be activated. This is beneficial, as many viruses have developed mechanisms to block the production of type I IFNs early after infection. PDCs constitutively express high levels of the transcription factor IRF-7, which allows rapid production of IFNs in response to infections (Honda et al. 2005). IFNs are considered the first line of defense against pathogens because of their ability to orchestrate numerous biological and cellular processes. Type I IFNs enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural killer and CD8 T cells (Biron 1998; Stetson and Medzhitov 2006; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly and Feng 2007) and regulate the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 by both CD8 and CD4 T cells (Biron 1998, 2001; O\u2019Shea and Visconti 2000; Stetson and Medzhitov 2006).",

            "text": "Recent studies have reported that PDCs also produce type III IFNs (IL28/29 or IFN \u03bb) in response to viruses (Coccia et al. 2004). Studies of the molecular events leading to type III IFN (IFN-III) production suggest a common mechanism with IFN-I (Ank et al. 2006; Onoguchi et al. 2007). IFN-III signal through a receptor complex composed of a unique IFN-\u03bbR1 chain in addition to a shared IL-10R2 chain, which is also the second subunit of the IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26 receptor complexes (Kotenko et al. 2003). However, whereas IFN-I receptors are expressed in most cell types, IFN-\u03bbR1 demonstrates a more restricted pattern of expression, limiting the response of IFN-III to primarily epithelium-like tissues (Witte et al. 2009; Khaitov et al. 2009; Mordstein et al. 2010). Using mice lacking functional receptors for type I IFN, type III IFN, or both, it was observed that IFN-III plays an important role in the defense against several human pathogens that infect the respiratory tract, such as influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS Coronavirus (Mordstein et al. 2010). Many studies (Shodell and Siegal 2002; Stout-Delgado et al. 2008; Jing et al. 2009; Canaday et al. 2010; Panda et al. 2010) document impairment in the secretion of IFN-I by PDCs from aged subjects in response to viruses. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of information on the status of IFN-III secretion by PDCs from aged subjects. Age-related alterations in IFN-III secretion may therefore be of great relevance since infection of soft or mucosal tissues are most common in the elderly.",

Recent reports suggest that secretion of IFN-III or IL-28/29 by PDCs also plays an important role in fighting microbial infections, particularly at mucosal surfaces (Coccia et al. 2004; Mordstein et al. 2010). Since IFN-III induction requires similar signals as IFN-I (Ank et al. 2006; Onoguchi et al. 2007), we determined if there was also an age-associated reduction in IFN-III secretion (Fig. 1b). We observed a highly significant reduction in the levels of IFN-III secretion by aged PDCs in response to influenza (Ag ~ 350 pg/ml, Yg ~ 908 pg/ml, p = 0.017) as compared with young subjects. The level of IFN-III reduction in the aged was more pronounced than the age-related decrease observed for IFN-I. In contrast to influenza, CPG induced low levels of IFN-III. Although CPG stimulation showed reduced IFN-III production by aged PDCs compared with young PDCs, the difference was not significant (Ag ~ 125 pg/ml, Yg ~ 200 pg/ml, p = 0.19).",

However, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) in the secretion of these cytokines and chemokines between the aged and young PDCs (Fig. 1c). These data demonstrate that PDCs from aged subjects show a selective impairment in their ability to secrete IFN-I and IFN-III in response to influenza virus. Since the impairment of cytokine secretion by aged PDCs is restricted to IFNs it suggests that the uptake of ligands by the TLRs is not compromised with age and the reduced IFN secretion may be a consequence of age-associated alterations in the signaling pathway responsible for production of IFN-I and IFN-III.",

The formation of the IRF-7, IRAK-1, and MyD88 complex is thus essential for IFN-I and IFN-III production. To investigate whether reduced IFN secretion by aged PDCs is due to a reduced expression of any of these signaling and adaptor molecules, we determined the level of expression of IRF-7, MyD88, and IRAK-1 between aged and young PDCs using real-time (RT) PCR. As shown in Fig. 3a, IRF-7, MyD88, and IRAK-1 gene expression levels are comparable between aged and young subjects, suggesting that the decrease in the expression of these genes is not responsible for the reduced IFN-I and IFN-III secretion in the aged.\n",

PDCs are critical in mounting an effective immune response against viruses because of their ability to secrete very high levels of IFNs (Liu 2005). Here, we demonstrate that purified PDCs from aged subjects secrete reduced quantities of IFN-I after stimulation with CPG and influenza virus relative to their young counterparts. This finding is consistent with numerous other studies that reported a decline in IFN-I production by PDCs from aged subjects in response to CPG and influenza in humans and mice (Shodell and Siegal 2002; Stout-Delgado et al. 2008; Jing et al. 2009; Canaday et al. 2010; Panda et al. 2010). Furthermore, we report a more pronounced decline in the production of IFN-III by aged PDCs in response to influenza. IFN-III is a recently discovered antiviral cytokine that has a similar activity as IFN-I except that its action is restricted to renal and mucosal epithelial surfaces (Dumoutier et al. 2004; Ank et al. 2006; Onoguchi et al. 2007; Sommereyns et al. 2008; Khaitov et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009; Mordstein et al. 2010). The IFN-III system is believed to have been evolved as a specific protection of epithelia and to prevent viral invasion through skin and mucosal surfaces. In a model for a localized Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) infection, it was observed that IFN-III completely blocked viral replication in the vaginal mucosa and prevented development of disease. This is in contrast to IFN-I, which had a more modest antiviral activity (Ank et al. 2006). IFN-III displayed moderate antiviral activity against systemic HSV-2 infection emphasizing its role in protection from microorganisms at mucosal surfaces. More recently, Mordstein et al. (Mordstein et al. 2010) observed that IFN-I and IFN-III receptor double-knockout mice showed enhanced susceptibility to various viruses that primarily replicate in lung epithelial cells such as influenza, RSV and SARS-Coronavirus. In contrast, they observed that IFN-III did not provide protection against intra-nasal infection with lassa virus. It was suggested this was because the expression of functional IFN-III receptors in the lung was restricted to epithelial cells. Our observation of a severe age-associated decline in the production of IFN-III may explain the increased risk of influenza and other respiratory infections in the elderly. It may also be important in defense against other infections such as those of skin and urinary tract that are prevalent in the elderly. The role of IFN-III has not been previously explored in aging. In contrast to influenza, we did not observe a significant age-associated reduction in IFN-III in response to CPG. This could be due to low levels of induction of IFN-IIIs by CPG. Reports indicate that IFN-III is induced after stimulation with several ssRNA viruses, whereas the information on viruses with other genomes (DNA and double-stranded RNA [dsRNA]) and bacteria is sparse (Brand et al. 2005; Ank et al. 2006).",

Contrary to these reports, our observations suggest that decreased IFN-I and IFN-III secretion by aged PDCs is due to an impaired phosphorylation of IRF-7, a key transcription factor responsible for the production of IFNs (Honda et al. 2004). Since PDCs constitutively express high levels of IRF-7 (Fitzgerald-Bocarsly and Feng 2007), activation via TLRs causes the phosphorylation of IRF-7 by IRAK-1. The phosphorylated IRF-7 translocates to nucleus to induce transcription of IFN-I. IFN-III induction in PDCs has also been observed to utilize a similar mechanism (Ank et al. 2006; Onoguchi et al. 2007). Age-associated declines in the activation of IRF-7 have been shown to be responsible for the decreased IFN-\u03b1 (IFN-I) secretion in PDCs in mice (Stout-Delgado et al. 2008). Further evidence that reduced expression of the TLR7 and 9 is not responsible for the decline in IFN production with age comes from the fact that aged PDCs display normal secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines (IP-10) after TLR stimulation, suggesting that the age-related defects in cytokine production may be limited to defective IFN signaling pathways.",

Reduced IFN-I secretion by aged PDCs may account for this decrease. Several studies have demonstrated that IFN-I plays an essential role in the differentiation and function of effector CD8 T lymphocytes. Kolumam et al. (2005) found that CD8 T cells lacking the type I IFN receptor were profoundly impaired in their ability to expand and differentiate into effector CTLs after LCMV infection, demonstrating that type I IFNs provide a non-redundant costimulatory signal in vivo. Similar to IFN-I, IFN-III can be induced by viral infections and has been observed to have potent antiviral activity against viral infections in vivo (Bartlett et al. 2005; Ank et al. 2006, 2008; Almeida et al. 2008). Several reports have now demonstrated that IFN-III has the ability to inhibit the replication of a number of viruses, including hepatitis C virus (Robek et al. 2005). IFN-III has also been shown to provide protection in mice from genital herpes infection and disease progression (Ank et al. 2006, 2008; Iversen et al. 2010). Type III IFNs are capable of inducing the expression by cells infected with virus of many antiviral proteins, such as dsRNA-activated serine/threonine protein kinase, 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS, and MxA (also known as MX1) proteins, which mediate antiviral protection (Brand et al. 2005; Ank et al. 2006). However, whether IFN-III has a direct effect on CD8 cytotoxicity is not clear at present.",

The efficiency of PDC as antigen-presenting cells has not been characterized in aging. Our data demonstrate that the PDC's ability to present antigens is severely compromised with age. Aged PDCs are impaired in their ability to induce CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion (Fig. 5). This suggests that aberrant PDC functions can adversely affect the adaptive immune response in older individuals.",

            "text": "In summary, we demonstrate that advancing age significantly affects the functions of PDCs at all levels from secretion of antiviral cytokines to priming of T cell responses. Therefore, the age-associated decline in PDC function may be a major factor responsible for the increased susceptibility of elderly individuals to infections. Delineating this functional decline may help in designing optimal therapies to treat infections in the elderly. For example, our findings suggest that administration of type III IFNs may be a novel approach to treating of respiratory viral infections in adults, particularly because the restricted expression of the IFN-III receptor will result in fewer side effects.",
