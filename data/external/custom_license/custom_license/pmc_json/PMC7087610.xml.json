The One Health or Ecohealth approach and its integration of human, animal, and environmental health and the concomitant critique of the epistemological fragmentation of the Western scientific tradition can be applauded, but scientific and political focus needs to shift from zoonotic disease to Human-Induced Disease. Human-Induced Disease includes both infectious\u2014i.e., zoonoses and disease from animal origin\u2014and non-infectious anthropogenically driven diseases. Human-Induced Disease as the label for diseases\u2014both infectious and non-infectious\u2014caused by human activities and their environmental impact emphasizes the role of the human in disease transmission and could serve reshaping our approach to disease management and prevention.",

Zoonoses incurred an estimated $20 billion in direct costs and over $200 in indirect losses in the last 10 years (World Bank 2010). These events generate moral panic, legitimate new spheres of legal activity, and spur new arguments for the funding of research. The arsenal of disease-combatting weapons grows constantly, evidenced by mass immunization or eradication of animal reservoirs. This dynamic derives from an anthropocentric perception and the psychologically useful imagination of a species barrier.",

Bacteria have a vital role in human bodily function and are integral elements of human cells (mitochondrion), and viruses constitute at least 10% of human DNA. Humans share most of the viruses, bacteria, and fungus with the rest of the animal kingdom, and thus it should come as no surprise that zoonotic pathogens were the cause of more than 65% of emergent infectious disease events in the last 60 years, with 75% of these originating in wild fauna (Keusch et al. 2009). The biologically relevant question is what allows or prevents infection by microorganisms, whether or not the infected species is human.",

Land use modification for urbanization, food production, and agricultural change accounts for around 50% of all zoonotic Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) (Keesing et al. 2010). Demographic, societal, and behavioral change gave rise to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS) (de Sousa et al. 2010) and outbreaks of syphilis (D\u2019Angelo-Scott et al. 2015). Anthropogenic environmental change leads to the emergence of infectious diseases in wildlife (Daszak et al. 2001) The advent of mass travel exacerbates the historically established dissemination of infectious disease along pathways of migration. Examples are bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis), cholera (Vibrio cholerae), seasonal influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) (Tatem et al. 2006). The trade in goods and animals is directly linked to outbreaks such as human monkeypox virus in North America (Karesh et al. 2005) or H5N1 in the United Arab Emirates (Naguib et al. 2015).",

Human activity gives rise to multiple forms of toxic pollution affecting both our health and the environment. For example, production of garments for international markets takes place mainly in developing countries and involves unregulated tannery operations that generate chromium pollutants known to have carcinogenic effects on both animals and humans. In 2013 industrial plants with poor waste treatment and disposal infrastructure were responsible for the lead pollution linked directly to the death from chronic illness of 853,000 people living mainly in low and middle income countries (Harris and McCartor 2011). The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation also estimated that lead exposure accounted for 9.3% of the global burden of idiopathic intellectual disability, 4% of the global burden of ischemic heart disease, and 6.6% of the global burden of stroke. UNESCO\u2019s World Water Assessment Programme estimates that industry is responsible for the annual accumulation of 300\u2013500 million tons of sludge, heavy metals, and other toxic wastes, and that 70% of untreated industrial waste in developing countries is dumped directly into water systems (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 2016).[For people of] poor countries, resource degradation is the most tragic, forced as they are to overuse natural resources from which depends their survival. They are driven to sacrifice their future to ensure precarious everyday life.
