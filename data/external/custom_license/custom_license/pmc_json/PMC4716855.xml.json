            "text": "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a major etiologic agent for malignant diseases of epithelial and lymphoid cell origin 1-3. Despite clear evidence supporting the correlation of EBV and many malignant tumors 4, 5, the underlying nature of EBV-host interaction remains elusive. The mode and influence of EBV integration is still not clear due to the lack of an impartial method to detect and survey genome-wide EBV integration sites, although EBV integration into host genome has been reported 6-11. Recently, the advancement of sequencing technology 12-17 offers an opportunity to study the global extent and functional impact of EBV integration into the cancer genome. C666-1 18 and Raji 19 are typical EBV positive cell lines. They are classic models to research viral-host interaction and used worldwide 20-28. A rare few EBV integrations sites in Raji were reported in previous research by traditional methods such as genome library construction 8 and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 9. Here we sequenced the C666-1 and Raji cell line genomes by deep (>60 coverage) whole genome sequencing to survey the entire viral integration distributions on virus and the host genome. Meanwhile, whole genome sequencing of C666-1 and Raji offered a chance to assemble their EBV genome strains, which should be useful resources for EBV-relative studies. To that end, sequencing the EBV-positive cancer cell genome provides a great solution to reveal the EBV integration distribution, the functional impact of viral integration on the host genome and the EBV genome characteristics.",

Paired-end reads with fragment length of about 500bp were aligned to the hybrid reference genome with Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA) 35. All mapped reads were subjected to a filtering process to remove possible PCR duplicates. Reads cover fuse boundaries of the human genome and the EBV genome are called split reads, which are partially mapped to the human genome (hg19) or the EBV genome (EBV-WT) in the original alignment result. Split reads are used to identify EBV integration positions. Extract split reads from the original alignment result and assemble the split reads into contigs. Match rate cutoff is set to 0.95. Split reads cover the same fuse boundary will be assembled into the same contig. Then realign the clipped part of the contigs to the hybrid reference genome. If the partially mapped part and the clipped part of a junction read respectively and uniquely mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) and the EBV genome (EBV-WT), the integration position is reported. After that, filter the integrations which length of sequence near the breakpoint are smaller than 30. The integrations need at least one split read to support them. Finally, pooled split reads come from the same integration position to get all integration events and its supporting split read numbers.",

First, we aligned all short reads from whole-genome sequencing to the human (hg19) and EBV reference genome sequence (NC007605) (Figure 1). The total raw data of viral sequence in C666-1 is 117,172,040 bp and 114,444,102 bp in Raji. This approach yielded very high coverage depth (759 \u00d7 in C666-1 and 1,312 \u00d7 in Raji). Aligned to the reference human sequence, the total raw data of C666-1 is 182,230,285,487bp, and Raji is 183,866,611,697 bp, and average coverage depth of human genome in C666-1 and Raji are 62.90 \u00d7 and 63.46 \u00d7, respectively (Table 1). Based on the total number of viral and human sequencing data, we estimate that, on average, C666-1 contains 12 (759.39/62.9) copies of the viral genome per diploid human genome and Raji contains 20 (1312.05/63.46) copies, approximately. We identified EBV integration sites by searching for human-EBV chimeric reads, in which one end mapped to the human genome and the other mapped to the EBV genome. Chimeric reads supporting the same EBV integration event were then clustered, yielding 909 unique EBV insertion sites in the two cell line (350 in C666-1 and 559 in Raji). (Figure 2A & 2B), 26 of which are supported by at least 2 chimeric reads (9 in C666-1 and 17 in Raji, Additional File 1: Table S1). Compared to the > 60\u00d7 sequencing coverage of human genome, integration event supported by relative less chimeric reads (maximum 33 reads) reveal heterogeneous, random viral integration events in both C666-1 and Raji cells.",

This indicates EBV is more suitable for whole genome sequencing to identify integration sites. Based on the result that C666-1 contained about 12 EBV genome copies per diploid human genome and was detected 350 sites, and simultaneously Raji included nearly 20 EBV genome copies per diploid human genome and was detected 559 sites, it is reasonable to speculate that the more copies of EBV genome exist per diploid human genome, the more likely viral integrations occur.",

Our validation result was similar to Jiang's study of HBV integration 55. Using whole genome sequencing, they found a lot of HBV low frequency integration sites and only validated 3 cases out of 24 sites (supporting reads = 2) by PCR. Hence, we could logically presume that EBV randomly integrates into human genome in most cases. Moreover, for detecting these low frequency sites, NGS is more sensitive than PCR. However, why most of integration sites are low frequency? There might be many potential reasons: Firstly, we observed the number of the chromosome viral integration sites was positive correlated with the total amount of the SVs and CNVs, and most breakpoints located inside or nearby genome structural variation regions, which is consistent with hit-and-run mechanism proposed by Jox 7. He assumed the integration might constitute a chromosomal region prone to break events akin to the phenomenon of fragile sites, leading to the loss of viral DNA as well as chromosomal DNA. Therefore, the EBV integration sequences could easily be lost due to the genome instability. Secondly, the integration might cause fatal cell damage so that the EBV integration sequence could not be preserved during cell culture. Thirdly, the EBV integration sequences are probably eliminated by host defending and repairing mechanism. Fourthly, comparing to the reference genome (hg19, NC007605), the host and virus genome in the two cell lines have great sequence variations, so we might lose some potential integration sites by our detecting methods aligning to the reference genome.",

The sequencing depth of the EBV strain in C666-1 was nearly 760\u00d7, and in Raji was 1312\u00d7. We assembled about 171 kb EBV whole genome sequence in C666-1 and 166 kb in Raji by de novo assembly. Compared with EBV-WT (NC_007605), 891 SNVs were found in C666-1 and 654 SNVs in Raji. Then, we constructed phylogenetic trees (Figure 6) of 20 EBV subtypes (C666-1, Raji, EBV-WT, B95-8, AG876, Akata, Mutu, K4123-Mi, K4413-Mi, GD1, GD2, HKNPC1 ~ HKNPC9) and the result showed that subtypes derived from the same disease were closely clustered, which indicated the high-accuracy of NGS and the correlation between subtypes and diseases. Compared with traditional EBV sequencing methods, NGS technology showed immense advantage in EBV genome sequencing, viral genome variations analysis, viral genome comparison and phylogenetic analyses to other subtypes. Before NGS technique has been developed, it was very difficult to obtain EBV genomic sequence. We knew little about the association between viral subtypes and EBV-relative diseases due to the limitations of traditional sequencing methods. Our study also supports the idea that a genome-wide survey of EBV integration variation is feasible for correlation analysis of EBV subtypes and viral integration capability.",

NGS improves our understanding on the essence of EBV-host interaction. In addition, our work could serve as a model for studies of other diseases with viral integration. In future study, a construction of cell line model before and after viral integration is helpful to observe transcriptional impact of integration. At present, most NGS platform can only sequence reads whose length is less than 400bp. With the advent of advanced sequencing technologies, such as single cell genome sequencing 56, 57 and the third generation sequencing technology which is able to sequence longer reads 58, we can reveal the mechanism of virus integration more deeply.",
