A new generation of biotech firms is focusing on antibody treatments and nucleic acid therapies that target cellular proteins as well as viral components. But progress has been slow and fitful. And the combination of rapidly adaptive and elusive viral pathogens with a profusion of new therapeutic strategies and novel targets could spell trouble in the clinic.",

            "text": "As illustrated by this focus (funded by principal sponsor Pfizer and supporting sponsor Gilead Sciences), the vast majority of the 50 or so antiviral treatments now approved are small molecules targeting a limited number of viral enzymes. The hegemony of the small molecule should be no surprise: viruses are intracellular parasites and the limitations of antibodies and most other biologics in penetrating cell membranes is well known. In addition, the heterogeneity of many viral pathogens (hepatitis C virus (HCV) has six different major genotypes varying in sequence by as much as 30%) and their propensity to mutate (HIV can evolve in days) has made it difficult to identify cross-reactive antibodies that are able to neutralize a variety of primary isolates. This is one reason why many biotech firms are developing either polyclonal antibody approaches or cocktails of two or more monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting different viral epitopes.",

With over 2,000 unique viral genomes already lodged in GenBank, advances in sequencing technology are transforming our ability to characterize emerging viral pathogens or resequence existing ones to look for drug resistance or a change in receptor tropism. It is a mark of progress that the genome sequence of SARS (severe acquired respiratory syndrome) coronavirus was obtained in a mere six days following isolation of the viral nucleic acid.",

Although the ability of both viral RNA and DNA to activate IFN production was reported by Isaacs back in 1963, it took four decades to identify the role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in sensing viral infection; RIG-I and MDA5 were only recently identified in the cytoplasm as sensors of viral RNA; and DAI, the first reported cytosolic sensor for viral DNA, was just reported in October (Nature\n448, 501\u2013505, 2007).",

New members of the expanding IFN protein family (e.g., recently identified type III IFN-\u03bb; interleukin 29) are also being turned into therapies.

In addition, many of the direst outcomes of viral disease are due to aberrant host immune responses (e.g., the cytokine storm elicited by 1918 influenza or Ebola virus); if it were possible to reduce the severity of such responses, patient outcomes might be improved. By addressing host proteins co-opted by different types of viral pathogen, broad-spectrum agents might also be created, maximizing commercial potential for companies and facilitating treatment selection by physicians.",

First, the complexity of human biology means that the task of identifying the key points for medical intervention could be more difficult than for simple viral targets. And drugs that target essential or integral cellular proteins may also induce harsher side effects (although this has not been insurmountable for other indications and current antiviral treatments are not exactly nontoxic).",

The best large animal model for HIV, for example, is simian immunodeficiency virus infection of macaques (chimpanzees injected with HIV fail to develop a human-like disease). To recognize the limitations of such models, look no further than the recent high-profile failure of Merck's HIV trivalent V520 vaccine\u2014which monkey studies had predicted would be protective.",
