The proteins VP0, VP1, VP3, Lpro, 2B, 3A, and 3Cpro play roles in inhibiting the host innate immune response (Li et al.2013, 2016a, b; Zhu et al.2016; Fan et al.2017; Rodriguez Pulido and Saiz 2017; Rodriguez Pulido and Sanchez-Aparicio 2018).

An interaction between the host factor Sam68 and 3D has been reported (Rai et al.2015).

            "text": "In general, viral infection triggers host innate immune responses through the activation of pattern recognition receptors, resulting in the anti-viral state of an organism (Xue et al.2018). DDX1, a dsRNA sensor, can activate type I IFN responses through the TRIF pathway (Zhang et al.2011). Thus, DDX1 may be involved in the activation of innate immune signaling pathways during viral infection. A recent study confirmed that DDX1 is involved in TGEV nsp14-induced IFN-\u03b2 production (Zhou et al.2017). Based on the results in the present study, we suggest that DDX1 is also involved in FMDV-induced type I IFN production. Notably, both TGEV and FMDV are single-stranded RNA viruses, and further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms by which DDX1 activates type I IFN during such infections. FMDV is sensitive to type I IFN (Zhu et al.2016). We therefore infer that DDX1 may inhibit FMDV replication by regulating type I IFN.",

Therefore, we speculated that the DDX1-DGAD mutant would fail to induce type I IFN, thereby compromising its inhibitory effect on FMDV replication. Our results are consistent with DDX1 being a mediator of FMDV-induced type I IFN production. However, the DDX1-DGAD mutant suppresses FMDV replication, indicating that DDX1 may exert its anti-FMDV effect through multiple mechanisms. In addition, our results confirmed the interaction between FMDV 3D and the DDX1-DGAD mutant (Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting that the conserved DEAD-box motif is not essential for the 3D-DDX1 interaction. This finding suggests that the 3D-DDX1 interaction may not affect the ATPase/helicase activity of DDX1 or DDX1-induced signaling pathways.",
