            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, or relapsing and remitting demyelinating disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS) specifically and ranks as a major cause of nervous system disability in young adults aged 20 to 45 [1\u20133].   It has long been hypothesized that oligodendrocytes (OLGs) and/or the myelin sheath are the target of immune system-mediated destruction in MS.  Recent studies have demonstrated that axonal damage [4, 5] also occurs and is likely to be a major component of long-term disability observed in MS. The etiology of MS is not very clearly known but the process of demyelination is believed to involve a Tcell-mediated phenomenon that may be triggered by one or more viral infections. Clinical studies show that infectious agents encountered during adolescence prime the diseases, which appear clinically later in the adult after a variable period of quiescence [6, 7].  Despite numerous attempts, a particular responsible virus has not been identified.  Our research has focused on understanding the mechanisms of demyelination.  We use the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model of murine demyelination in order to dissect the inflammatory and molecular mechanisms of viral-induced demyelination.",

There are other but not many CNS disorders in which increased amounts of IgG and OGBs are found.   All those diseases are inflammatory, and most are infectious.  Furthermore, when the specificity of the increased IgG and OGBs in those diseases was studied, the IgG in every condition was shown to be antibody directed against the agent that caused disease.  For example, the oligoclonal IgG found in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) brain and CSF is directed against measles virus [9] not herpes simplex virus or mumps virus; in cryptococcal meningitis, the IgG is directed against cryptococcus and not another fungus such as candida [10].  These findings provide a rationale for the notion that the oligoclonal IgG in MS brain and CSF is antibody directed against the agent that causes disease.",

In virus-induced demyelination, infection is a necessary prerequisite for demyelination, and the cause/effect relationship makes this model an attractive platform for exploring the etiology and pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases.  Chronic viral-induced demyelination is associated with viral persistence [24, 25] and concomitant enhancement of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens [26\u201330].  These features parallel many of the pathologic findings seen in MS, in contrast to monophasic viral or postviral human demyelinating diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) [31] and PML [32].",

Thus, different related strains of MHV may induce demyelination via unique mechanisms, and it is likely that in the absence of an intact immune response, some strains of MHV infection in the CNS are responsible for the onset of demyelination, possibly through the direct destruction of OLGs. MHV-induced demyelination can serve as a model for oligodendroglial tropic, nonimmune-mediated mechanisms of demyelination that may have important relevance for our understanding of MS.",

These serve as mechanisms of virus evolution and modulation of viral pathogenesis, a largely unexplored area of study which offers deep insight into the genomic control of biological properties.  But for a long time the large genome size was a technical obstacle to achieving such a goal with coronaviruses. This problem was circumvented by molecularly cloning defective interfering-like RNA, leveraging the high RNA recombination frequencies during mixed infection. This targeted recombination technique in MHV was developed by Dr. Paul S. Masters and colleagues  and used extensively to introduce alterations into the 3\u2032 end of the MHV genome [62\u201364].  It was able not only to exchange specifically the structural and non structural genes among the MHV strains but also to introduce single amino acid substitutions.

They also showed that axonal damage is, in large part, immune mediated in MHV-infected mice and occurs concomitantly with demyelination. Concurrent axonal loss and demyelination have recently also been observed with S protein recombinant DM strain-infected mouse spinal cord as shown in Figure 3 ((a) demyelination; (b) axonal Loss) [73].",

Clearance of infectious virus is mediated by both cytolytic-and cytokine-mediated mechanisms. Exact mechanisms of MHV-induced demyelination are unclear although both macrophages and T cells modulate pathologic changes [41, 77].  Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, Rag-1 knockout mice, and UV-irradiated mice infected with MHV-JHM have few lesions 7\u201315 days p.i despite viral replication [40, 41, 76\u201378]. These data suggest that lymphocytes are required for demyelination.  However, demyelination mediated by \u03b3\u03b4T cells still occurs in nude mice that lack CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [79].  Interestingly, demyelination occurs to a similar extent in wild type, B cell-deficient, and Rag-1 knockout mice and in mice lacking antibody receptors or active complement pathways, when infected with MHV-A59 [42].",

Viral RNA persistence has been demonstrated in infections with all of the neurotropic demyelinating strains of MHV including JHM and MHV-A59 [24, 25, 80].  Viral RNA persistence appears to be an important factor and perhaps even a prerequisite for MHV-induced demyelination during chronic immune-mediated demyelination.  MHV strains that do not persist, such as MHV-2 and Penn 97-1 (laboratory recombinant strains of MHV) [81, 82], also do not demyelinate.  However, the persistence-positive, demyelination-negative phenotypes of Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 (S protein recombinant strain of MHV) [81] indicate that viral persistence per se is insufficient to induce demyelination.  Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 (S protein recombinant strain) [81] may persist in neuronal cells of gray matter while demyelinating strains, such as MHV A59, persist in white matter, suggesting that cell-specific persistence is necessary for demyelination.  During chronic infection, MHV RNA persistence in the white matter has previously been demonstrated [25].  However, it is not known which glial cells are mainly responsible for the induction of demyelination.",

On the other hand, neurotropic nondemyelinating MHV3 has an in vitro affinity for neurons, ependymal cells and meningothelial cells but not for astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. MHV3 can induce an initial ependymitis, meningitis, and encephalitis in the absence of white matter lesions [49]. These observations reinforce the importance of glial cell infection in the onset of demyelination. Astrocytes and microglia play an important defensive role in MHV pathogenesis by secreting cytokines [85\u201387]. Cytokines are believed to aid in host defense against MHV by contributing to elimination of the virus from the CNS.  It has been reported that specific cytokines and chemokines (such as Interferon \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF- \u03b1), IL-2, Il-6, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 are all induced during the acute stage of MHV infection in the CNS [88]. TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 are reportedly secreted by astrocytes of persistently infected spinal cords [89]. The role of individual CNS cells in the induction of demyelination remains to be further elaborated.",

Similar to brain, H & E and LCA staining demonstrated that both MHV-A59 and MHV-2 induced meningitis whereas only MHV-A59 induced myelitis (Figures 6(a) and 6(c)). In MHV-2 infection, inflammatory cells were rare and restricted near the ependymal cell lining of the central canal (Figures 6(b) and 6(d)). Similar to the brain, the majority of inflammatory cells in MHVA59 were CD11b+ (Figure 6(c)). Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining was performed to visualize myelin [94]. Demyelinating plaques developed as early as day 5 post inoculation in MHV-A59-infected mice (Figure 6(e)), with no demyelination in MHV-2-infected mice (Figure 6(f)). Day 30-post inoculation tissue sections from MHV-A59-infected mice showed a similar pattern of demyelination as on day 5, but the number and area of plaques were larger, and MHV-2-infected mice did not exhibit any demyelination. To avoid a high mortality rate of MHV-2 due to hepatitis, 0.5 LD50 doses (50 PFUs) were used. However, to ensure that the inability of MHV-2 to cause encephalitis or demyelination is not dose dependent, mice  were also inoculated with MHV-A59 at 50 PFUs. MHV-A59 produced larger demyelinating lesions given at 2,000 PFUs than at 50 PFUs, but with both doses, 100% of mice were affected. Results confirm earlier findings that MHV-A59 induces demyelination whereas MHV-2 is nondemyelinating at day 30 [47].  Demyelination was not previously assessed at earlier time points.  Demyelination begins as early as day 5 post inoculation, indicating that MHV-A59-induced myelin damage begins at the time of acute inflammation, similar to what is observed in MS and EAE lesions [95].",

Optic nerves from MHV-A59- and MHV-2-infected mice were cut into 5 \u03bcm longitudinal sections and stained with H & E and inflammatory cell markers. For comparison, relapsing EAE was induced in 8-week-old SJL/J mice by immunization with proteolipid protein peptide as described previously in [96]. Mice were sacrificed on day 11 post immunization, when incidence of ON peaks and optic nerves were isolated. Inflammatory cells infiltrating the optic nerve sheath and parenchyma are shown by H & E and LCA staining (Figures 7(a) and 7(b)) 5 days post inoculation with MHV-A59, similar to inflammation seen in EAE ON [94]. In contrast, optic nerves from MHV-2-infected mice did not develop ON (Figures 7(d) and 7(e)), with histological appearance similar to control optic nerves. Both CD11b+ and fewer CD3+ cells were noted in MHV-A59-infected optic nerves similar to brain. By day 15 post MHV-A59 infection, optic nerve inflammation completely resolved.  Detection of viral antigen in optic nerves was limited to axons because there are no neuronal cell bodies present. Light diffuse staining detected in optic nerves from MHV-A59-infected mice (Figure 7(c)), but not MHV-2-infected mice (Figure 7(f)), suggests that MHV-A59 viral antigen is likely present in optic nerve axons. Consistent with the observed pattern of inflammation, optic nerves from MHV-A59-infected mice had areas of demyelination detected by LFB staining 30 days post inoculation whereas no demyelination occurred in MHV-2-infected mice. The degree of optic nerve inflammation was scored on a 0 (no inflammation) to 4 (severe inflammation) point scale described previously in [96\u201398], with any amount of inflammation (score 1\u20134) considered positive for ON. ON was detected as early as 3 days post inoculation with MHV-A59, with peak incidence at day 5 (Figure 8(a)) and resolution by day 15. At the peak of ON (day 5), almost 50% (10 of 21) of optic nerves examined from MHV-A59-infected mice had ON (Figure 8(b)), with an average relative inflammation score of 1.7 \u00b1 0.21 whereas, only one of 21 nerves from MHV-2-infected mice had even mild inflammation (score 1.0). Incidence of ON in EAE was 60% (6 of 10) with a 1.83 \u00b1 0.31 average inflammation score, similar to prior studies [96, 98] and comparable to the incidence induced by MHV-A59 infection.",

Inflammation triggered by MHV infection consists of mixed inflammatory cells, predominantly macrophages/microglia, which differs somewhat from immune-mediated models of MS where infiltrating T cells are significant contributors to pathology [95, 100]. Importantly, MHV-A59 also induces ON with similar severity and incidence as seen in the autoimmune antigen-triggered model EAE. Experimental ON is an important model being used to characterize neuronal damage and develop novel therapies for MS [98, 101\u2013103], but studies have shown that different EAE models, induced by distinct antigens, lead to different mechanisms of RGC loss [96, 104]. The MHV-A59-induced ON model will provide a critical adjunct to study the pathophysiology of ON secondary to viral-mediated inflammation as this is one mechanism that can cause ON and MS in human patients.",

Among the structural proteins the S protein interacts with the host receptor and mediates viral-cell membrane fusion during viral entry [105]. The ~1300 amino acid spike protein in MHV-A59 is usually posttranslationally cleaved into two domains which associate with each other to form a functional dimer.  In the S protein from MHV-2 strain, however, this cleavage does not occur, the reasons for which are not clearly evident. A look at the pairwise alignment between the S proteins from MHV-A59 and MHV-2 reveals that around 84% residues are common in both the chains and an additional 10% residue is similar. The 6% residues with no identity or similarity, include a 43-residue insertion in MHV-2. This insertion is by far the most significant difference in the sequence. ",

Molecularly cloned vector pMH54 [111, 113], which contains the entire 3' end of the genome from MHV-A59, was used for construction of the recombinant viruses.  Comparative pathological studies between recombinant DS (wtR13) and the NDS Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 demonstrated that Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 exhibit similar inflammatory infiltration (encephalitis) (Figures 9(a) and 9(b)) in the CNS during the acute stage. While wtR13 can induce demyelination at day 30 p.i. (Figure 9(c)), Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 are unable to induce demyelination (Figure 9(d)).   Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 also exhibited chronic stage persistence in the spinal cord [81]. For convenience and clarity, in subsequent sections these recombinant strains were labeled in different names though they are the same but presented in different names, Penn 98-1 and Penn 98-2 are referred to as RSMHV2 (viruses expressing the MHV-2 spike in the MHV-A59 background) and wtR13 as RSA59 (viruses expressing the MHV-A59 spike in the MHV-A59 background).

Previously this type of study was carried out using specific antibodies that detect viral antigen in tissues.  Targeted recombination was used to select MHV isolates with stable and efficient expression of the gene encoding EGFP to facilitate the in vivo detection of virus in the mouse CNS as well as to trace the viral entry and spread in tissue culture [114]. The EGFP gene was inserted into the MHV genome in place of the nonessential gene 4, as interruption of the ORF 4 did not decrease neurovirulence in JHM [115]. The viruses replicated with similar kinetics as wild-type virus both in tissue culture and in the mouse CNS. They caused similar encephalitis and demyelination in animals as the wild-type virus or their recombinant strains; however, they were somewhat attenuated in virulence. Isogenic EGFP-expressing viruses differ only in the S gene and express either the S gene of the highly neurovirulent. Previously used names for RSJHMEGFP and RSA59EGFP are S4REGFP and SA59REGFP, respectively. JHM spike-mediated neurovirulence was associated with extensive viral spread in the brain [114].  The difference in virulence and patterns of spread of viral antigen between the two isogenic recombinant strains reflected the differences between parental viruses expressing each of these S genes [81, 107]. These EGFP-expressing viruses are powerful tools that can be used to follow viral spread over time without terminating infection by the fixation necessary for immunofluorescence. In order to further compare the differential pathogenesis and the CNS cell tropism between DM and NDM strain of MHV, an EGFP-expressing NDS of MHV RSMHV2EGFP, which contains the MHV-2 (NDS) S gene in the MHV-A59 background, was constructed [114]. A cartoon representation of construction of EGFP-tagged strains of MHV has been shown in Figure 10. Detailed molecular studies show the EGFP gene is inserted and expressed at high levels that can be readily detected by microscopy [114].",

To examine this, serial sections of spinal cords from RSA59EGFP- (DM) and RSMHV2EGFP- (NDM)-infected mice were stained parallaly by LFB and Bielchowsky silver impregnation.

In addition, there are numerous hypomyelinated fibers and naked axons without any myelin sheath, indicative of a demyelinating process (Figures 14(b)\u201314(d)).  These naked axons are fully intact with surrounding axolemmas and axoplasm with preserved microtubules and intermediate filaments (Figure 14(e)).

On day 7 p.i., the DM fluorescence was mainly restricted to white matter (Figures 17(a) and 17(b)) with limited involvement of gray matter whereas NDM fluorescence was restricted to gray matter (Figures 17(c) and 17(d)).  High-magnification fluorescence images in brain from day 7 p.i. demonstrate numerous neurons and their axons following DM infection (Figure 17(e)) whereas far fewer fluorescent neurons and axons are observed following NDM infection (Figure 17(f)).  The ability of DM and NDM to replicate and spread in vitro was compared using primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and described in very recent studies.  Immunostaining of MAP2b [117] and GFAP [118] demonstrated that cultures consisted primarily of neurons. At 12 hours intervals, from 0 to 72 hours p.i., cultures were monitored for viral antigen spread by fluorescence microscopy.  At 24 hours p.i. several infected foci were observed in DM-infected cultures (Figure 17(g)) whereas, in NDM-infected cultures, very few discrete cells were positive for EGFP (data not shown).  At 72 hours p.i., the average number of EGFP positive cells was significantly increased following infection with DM (Figure 17(h)).  In contrast, NDM-infected cultures had viral infection restricted only to the initially infected neurons, with little or no spread to adjacent cells, consistent with in vivo studies (Figure 17(i)) [73].

The relative contributions of these two components differ depending on a number of virus and host factors including viral tropism, rate of viral spread, and specificity of the immune response.  During acute infection, neurotropic and demyelinating strains (DM) of MHV infect a number of cell types in the CNS such as neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia [21, 70, 91, 118, 119]. Recently by using the S gene recombinant virus (S4 R, containing S gene from a highly neurovirulent MHV-4 on the background of MHV-A59) it has been demonstrated that S gene-mediated neurovirulence of MHV is associated with extensive viral spread in the brain in both neurons and astrocytes [108]. Thus far it was not known whether NDM of MHV infects the same cell types as DS. The phenomenon of demyelination may be due to primary infection of a single cell type, or alternatively, infection of diverse CNS cell types leading to the final destruction of OLGs/myelin sheath and the axon.

            "text": "Localization studies showed that MHV strains differ in their neurovirulence and ability to demyelinate and also differ in their ability to infect particular CNS cell types.  RSJHMEGFP infects neurons with greater efficiency, and infection may spread more rapidly than in RSA59EGFP,   while RSMHV2EGFP infects neurons with limited efficiency.  This is consistent with previous findings that the degree of neurovirulence is not only dependent on neuronal tropism but also on the number of infected neurons and spread of the infection through neurites [108].  Evidence from closely related strains of neurotropic viruses including HIV,  TMEV, and reovirus supports the hypothesis that CNS cell tropism and spread in CNS cells play a major role in the distribution and type of CNS lesions [120, 121]. Studies with LCMV and HIV also suggest that virus strains that exhibit rapid spread are associated with increased immune-mediated pathology [122, 123].  Recently, it has been demonstrated that MHV spread to the spinal cord white matter occurs very rapidly, and protection from demyelination can be achieved by inhibiting this viral spread during the acute phase of infection by recruiting high numbers of MHV-specific CD8+ T cells [124].   Nondemyelinating strain is less able to infect neurons and spread through neurons; on the other hand, demyelinating strains are highly neuron tropic and spread rapidly through neurites. In contrast, it has been observed that a temperature-sensitive demyelinating mutant of JHM infects mainly nonneuronal cells, having a strong tropism specifically for astrocytes and causes white matter lesions. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody selected JHM variant, a S protein mutant, infects the glial cells predominantly in the CNS, causing subacute demyelination. Interestingly, the neurotropic and nondemyelinating MHV3 strain, which has an in vitro tropism for neurons, ependymal cells, and meningeal cells but not for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, can induce initial ependymitis, meningitis, and encephalitis in the absence of white matter lesions.  Our in vivo data demonstrate that the highly neurovirulent strain RSJHMEGFP has very little tropism for astrocytes.  RSA59EGFP and RSMHV2EGFP infect astrocytes with similar efficiency.  As demyelinating and nondemyelinating strains produce similar infections in astrocytes, it appears that astrocytic infection during the acute stage alone may not determine the onset of demyelination.  Our observations suggest that astrocyte tropism may be a relevant factor in persistent infection but direct astrocytic infection alone may not be sufficient to induce demyelination.  This study highlights the important role of neural cell tropism of viral antigen in MHV-induced demyelination in the CNS.",

            "text": "The development of chronic demyelination involves replication and spread of viral antigen in the spinal cord during the acute stage of infection and the persistence of viral RNA in white matter. This is substantiated by current observations on viral spread of NDM MHV in the spinal cord, where viral antigen during the acute phase of infection is mainly restricted to gray matter. In contrast, viral antigen from demyelinating strains spreads from gray to white matter during the acute stage of infection [73, 116]. Specifically, after intracranial infection and replication, viral antigens from the demyelinating strains RSJHMEGFP and RSA59EGFP  are mostly seen in spinal cord gray matter at day 5 post infection and then in the white matter at day 7 post infection.  This finding establishes that demyelinating and nondemyelinating strains differ in their viral antigen distribution in gray matter and white matter during acute infection. Viral persistence observed previously in RSMHV2-infected mouse spinal cord during the chronic phase of infection may be due to the presence of viral RNA in gray matter.  Viral RNA for demyelinating strains is known to persist mainly in the white matter. Due to lack of viral RNA persistence in the white matter, essential for the induction of demyelination during chronic infection, RSMHV2 is unable to induce demyelination.  It is possible that cell-specific viral RNA persistence is necessary for demyelination.  These combined observations reinforce the importance of glial cell infection in the onset of demyelination.",

Both DM and NDM strains infect neurons; however, these strains differ in their capacity to translocate to white matter as determined by fluorescence of EGFP tagged viral particles. The current experiments indicate that axonal transport of viral particles is an important mechanism mediating not only the extent of axonal damage but also the subsequent induction of demyelination in the spinal cord.  DM strain shows white matter involvement early (by day 7 p.i.) and at later time points that gray matter involvement is essentially absent in the spinal cord, with only minimal involvement in the brain.  This observation further supports earlier findings that DM and NDM strains differ in their viral antigen distribution during acute infection in the spinal cord [116]. Evaluation of axonal loss and demyelination in the spinal cord, where there is clear separation of gray matter and large tracts of white matter, demonstrated that DM MHV infection begins in the neuronal cell body and propagates centripetally to the axon [73] which subsequently induces axonal degeneration and demyelination.  NDM strains were unable to propagate from gray to white matter and as a result and were unable to induce demyelination.  ",

A less likely possibility is that infection proceeds indirectly from neurons to oligodendrocytes by intermediary cells such astrocytes, microglia, or endothelial cells.  Regardless of the mechanism of viral spread, ultimately, macrophages and microglia are recruited to the areas of infection.  In this way, MHV infection triggers axonal loss and macrophage-mediated demyelination.  However, we have also observed in NDM strain infection, that axonal degeneration and myelin disruption can occur in the absence of macrophages.  Therefore, MHV infection can both directly and indirectly cause axonal loss and demyelination.

Similar mechanisms of axonal transport of virus particles have been observed for the alpha herpesviruses, Herpes simplex virus and pseudorabies virus [125, 126]. Furthermore,  Theiler's murine encephalitis virus (TMEV), a nonenveloped virus that, like MHV,  causes chronic demyelination in mice, is able to traffic from the axon into the surrounding myelin in the absence of cell lysis [127].  Thus, by a mechanism involving transneuronal spread, MHV may gain access to synaptically linked neuronal circuits and glial cells.  It is not clear, however, which type (s) of glial cells must be infected in order to promote the development of MHV-induced chronic demyelinating disease. ",

            "text": "The current studies further demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms underlying axonal damage are mediated by the S glycoprotein.  The recombinant DM and NDM viruses used are isogenic on a background of the DM MHV-A59 strain and differ only by the virus-host attachment S glycoprotein.  In vivo, the S protein host receptor is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which functions as an intercellular adhesion molecule [56, 133, 134]. However, there is evidence that other viral entry host factors may also be permissive for viral infection [135].  Evidently, the difference in the S proteins between the DM and NDM strains does not impair host-receptor interactions or viral entry since both strains effectively cause encephalitis following transcranial inoculation.  The S protein does, however, appear to play a critical role in axonal transport, with a lack of viral antigen spread and subsequent inflammation extending into spinal cord white matter following infection with the NDM strain in contrast to extensive white matter involvement secondary to DM strain infection being observed.  As mentioned earlier, MHV S is synthesized as a 180kDa glycosylated precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved into two 90kDa subunits, S1 and S2 [136], with a receptor-binding domain in the S1 subunit [137] that is responsible for the initial attachment of MHV to cell surface receptors. This binding event triggers a conformational change in S that allows S2 to initiate fusion of the virus and host membranes [138\u2013140]. A candidate fusion peptide domain has been identified within S2 [141]; however, the actual fusion peptide for the MHV S has not been definitively identified. MHV-A59 and MHV-2 S proteins have 82% amino acid sequence identity and 94% similarity, with the S2 domain relatively more conserved and S1 more variable [93]. They also differ in their cleavage signal site whereby MHV-A59 S is cleaved posttranslationally into S1 and S2 subunits, but MHV-2 S protein is not cleaved and unable to cause fusion in vivo and in vitro. Thus, variable regions of the S1 domain or differences in the cleavage signal site between DM and NDM strains are candidate domains that may potentially explain the differential axonal transport and demyelination observed in our studies and need to be evaluated further in future studies.

            "text": "Genes other than the S sometimes referred to as \u201cbackground genes\u201d also influence pathogenesis.  In addition to structural proteins and replicase, all MHVs encode small unique proteins with unknown functions (ORF2a, 4, and 5a) [142]. The proteins encoded in these three ORFs appear to be nonessential for replication.   It is instructive to note that, apart from the molecular role of the S gene in MHV pathogenesis, several additional genes have also been implicated in the disease etiology.  Asides from their structural roles, N and M proteins are believed to function in host interactions. In porcine coronavirus, TGEV, mutations in the M protein ectodomain that impair N-glycosylation decrease the interferogenic activity and antibodies directed to the TGEV M ectodomain block IFN-\u03b3 induction [143]. For MHV, the glycosylation state of M protein may effect the ability to induce IFN\u03b3 and also to replicate in the liver [144]. In measles infection, a defective M transmembrane protein has been related to the difference in the ability of the virus to persist in the CNS and cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) [145].  The N protein has been implicated in MHV-induced hepatitis [146, 147]. In addition, the replicase and other non structural proteins could affect tropism and pathogenesis by influencing the rate of viral replication perhaps by interactions with cell type specific factors or with elements of the immune response [148].",

            "text": "Current available studies demonstrate that the mechanisms of white matter injury in this model of CNS demyelinating disease are due to a combination of both axonal injury/loss and myelin damage.  In DM infection, there is concomitant axonal loss and demyelination, and at least some demyelination is due to macrophage-mediated myelin stripping.  One can hypothesize that axonal degeneration follows in this immune-mediated pathogenesis.  Partial axonal loss also appears to occur secondary to direct viral-induced cytopathic effects, a non-immune-mediated mechanism. Following NDM infection, although relatively rare, myelinated fibers in the spinal cord white matter exhibit early axonal degeneration in the absence of any associated inflammation.  Therefore, MHV infection exhibits diverse mechanisms of axonal loss and demyelination that are both immune and nonimmune mediated. While the underlying mechanisms leading to the development of MS in patients are not known, numerous studies have provided evidence to suggest that a viral infection may trigger this autoimmune demyelinating disease.  The critical role of the S glycoprotein in viral transport and subsequent axonal and myelin damage demonstrated in the current studies suggests that targeted disruption of the S glycoprotein-host interaction has the potential to prevent the onset or progression of demyelination. Future experiments need to be geared toward identifying how the S proteins interact with the axonal transport system.  Clues may be provided by other human viral neurologic infections, including those caused by such diverse viruses as Herpes Simplex and Rabies, as they take advantage of the axonal transport system in order to maximize spread and neurovirulence. Experimental mouse model provides an excellent means by which the particular host-virus interactions responsible for successful axonal transport can be dissected and clarified.",
