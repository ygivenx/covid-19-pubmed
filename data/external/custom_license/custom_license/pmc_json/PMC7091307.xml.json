However, more recent data suggest that over the past 5\u201310 years, the overall global trends of asthma incidence have begun to stabilize [1]. Urbanization and industrialization has contributed to the increase in developed countries, but the reasons for this are still unclear. Asthma is estimated to be responsible for one in every 250 deaths worldwide. Many of these deaths are preventable, and specific issues have been identified that may contribute to this high mortality rate. Factors that contribute to high mortality and morbidity include slow access to care and medications, inadequate environmental control of allergens and irritants, dietary changes, genetic variations, cultural barriers, lack of education among patients and providers, insufficient resources, and improper use of health care dollars.",

Hospitalizations for asthma have clearly decreased as a result of the use of controller medications. Quality of life has been identified as a significant metric to measure asthma treatment success. On the other hand, despite our improved knowledge of the pathogenesis of asthma, newer medications with fewer adverse effects, and increased standardization of treatment protocols, there has been a paradoxical increase in asthma mortality. The reasons for this observation are debatable but may include lifestyle changes [5], dietary changes [6], the increase in obesity rates in the Western hemisphere [7], coding anomalies [8], poor patient and/or caregiver education, and the overall increase in the incidence of allergies and asthma. What is clear, however, is that the development and introduction of new pharmaceuticals is not by itself the answer to improving outcomes in children with asthma. Patient education, environmental avoidance measures, proper use of medications, and immunotherapy are all equally important in the successful treatment of the pediatric asthmatic. The good news is that with our awareness of these factors, mortality has at least stabilized over the past 5 years.",

The diagnosis of asthma in children may be difficult to make in the infant because of the prevalence of viral-associated wheezing in this age group of patients. The impact of viral illness on the development of asthma in later years is addressed below, along with the role of allergies in childhood asthma. Certain medications are not always appropriate for all ages, and devices that are used to evaluate asthma status may not be usable by young children. Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is particularly important in childhood as physical activity is critical to controlling the epidemic of obesity in developed countries, especially the USA. Lifestyle changes, including the use of television, Internet, and other video devices, may play a role in childhood asthma. Finally, the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d has introduced the concept that early exposure to animals, foods, or endotoxin may actually be protective against allergic sensitization. While this is still a controversial issue, it illustrates the complexity of asthma as a heterogeneous disease, with genetic and environmental influences. Indeed, we now know that there is no single asthma gene, rather that there are multiple genetic variants that, under the proper environmental conditions, can result in asthma.\n\n",

A good history includes current or past history of cough, wheezing, viral respiratory diseases, accompanying allergy symptoms or signs, shortness of breath, and sinus problems. It is also important to ask an exposure history, to try and determine triggers for the episodes. This can include indoor allergen exposures, outdoor pollens, viral upper respiratory infections and exercise, exposure to foods that may be causing symptoms, and an occupational history of both the child (if old enough to be working) and the parents or caregivers. Exposure to day care is also important and environmental tobacco smoke and pollution exposure should also be documented. A past medical history asking about previous hospitalizations, doctor visits, frequent otitis media, sinusitis or pneumonia, and a complete medication history, including use of nebulizers or inhalers and any other pertinent medications, should be elicited.

Common allergens can be categorized into either indoor or outdoor allergens. The outdoor allergens are mostly linked to seasonal allergic rhinitis, while indoor allergens are linked to perennial allergic rhinitis. There are geographical differences in the seasonal distribution of pollen allergens. Recently, it has been suggested that climate change may be impacting the prevalence of various outdoor allergens through different mechanisms. In addition, environmental exposures and host factors can lead to changes in an individual\u2019s sensitivities throughout life.

The smaller the particle, the greater the penetration into the airway. Particles greater than 10 \u03bcm in diameter are generally cleared in the upper airway. Although these larger particles can indirectly trigger early- or late-phase asthma reactions by virtue of their action in the upper airways, fine and ultrafine particles present a more significant problem due to their deeper penetration into the smaller airways [26]. Recently, evidence has surfaced that these ultrafine particles indeed possess effects on inflammatory cells such as neutrophils or eosinophils that can lead to asthma symptoms.

Lack of exercise also promotes obesity, which has been linked to asthma [28]. Therefore, we no longer recommend that children with asthma stop exercising. In fact, exercise can help to build lung reserve. With proper control of asthma using controller medications, a patient with exercise-induced asthma can almost always participate in regular cardiovascular training without adverse effects. Asthma can even be managed successfully in the elite athlete [29]. The severity of a patient\u2019s EIA can be evaluated using an exercise challenge test. Historically, the methodology of exercise challenge tests has been very inconsistent, but recently the American Thoracic Society has proposed a set of criteria that should be met in order to ensure an accurate and valid test [30]. These criteria and a typical protocol are illustrated in Fig. 3.\n\n",

Better distinction is made between monitoring asthma control and classifying asthma severity. Severity is defined as the intrinsic intensity of asthma and is still grouped into the original classification of mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent. Categorizing severity in this manner is helpful for initiating therapy. Control is defined as the response to therapy, in terms of the degree to which manifestations of asthma are kept to a minimum.

Because sometimes patient history, especially in children, can be inaccurate, spirometry provides an objective assessment of the child\u2019s condition. Spirometry can be attempted at about 4 to 5 years of age, but at these very young ages, obtaining reliable results depends on the child\u2019s ability to follow instructions and their physical coordination. Data on predicted values of spirometry parameters have been obtained by several investigators and are dependent on age, gender, height, and ethnic background. However, as in the case of peak flow measurement, there is significant individual variability, and it is important to establish each child\u2019s baseline spirometry. Obviously, as the child grows, this will change, so frequent updates may be needed.

Monitoring of peak flows not only gives a continuous assessment of the patient\u2019s condition but also may help as a reminder for patients to take their control medications, thus improving compliance. Patients should be instructed to bring their asthma diary sheets to their doctor visit, so that their progress can be reviewed.

ECP was not predictive for any other respiratory disease [57]. When patients with asthma are bronchial challenged with allergen, activation of eosinophils and generation of specific eosinophilic mediators result. Evaluation and continued monitoring of eosinophil and ECP may be a way to assess efficacy of asthma therapy and airway inflammation in children with allergic asthma [58]. Both leukotriene receptor antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with a reduction in sputum ECP levels in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma [59, 60].

Most of these have been attributed to oral or parenteral steroids. In children with asthma, the major concerns regarding inhaled or nebulized steroids have been the effect on growth [65\u201367]. Studies to determine if inhaled corticosteroids indeed have such an effect are difficult to conduct because asthma itself has been associated with growth retardation [68]. Results have therefore been inconsistent; however, the bulk of the evidence suggests that even if there is growth retardation, this is usually reversible and there is a period of \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth. Moreover, even if corticosteroids do indeed affect growth, the extent of growth retardation is minimal. Thus, the risk of growth retardation is small compared to the potential for serious asthma exacerbations. Adrenal suppression in children on inhaled steroids is also not a significant problem. In a study of 14 children on a dry powder beclomethasone dipropionate inhaler, there was no suppression of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis [69]. The dose of beclomethasone was 12\u201325 \u03bcg/kg/day. Other studies have failed to demonstrate adverse effects on the HPA axis [70, 71]. On the other hand, use of high doses of fluticasone has been shown to cause HPA axis suppression [72]. It is not known if there is any clinical significance to these observed effects. A list of the available inhaled corticosteroids and their daily dosing regimens in pediatrics is shown in Table 12.\n\n\n",

Salmeterol xinafoate possesses a long hydrocarbon chain connecting the binding site with the active site of the molecule. Theoretically, this conformation allows repetitive interaction between the active site and the target receptor, as the binding site is firmly attached to an alternate site on the cell membrane and the long chain acts as a tether. Salmeterol is indicated down to age 4. It used to be available as an MDI and the diskus, but now only the diskus is available.

They should also provide some benefit, especially in children, where the greater proportion of asthma is associated with allergies [79]. The currently available second-generation antihistamines in the USA are cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine. These drugs block the allergic effect of environmental allergens, but cetirizine also inhibits leukocyte recruitment and activation and eosinophil migration [80] and has been shown to decreases late leukocyte migration into antigen-challenge skin blister fluid chambers [81].

Systemic steroids, administered orally or parenterally on a chronic basis, are associated with a long list of adverse effects, many of which are potentially more serious than the disease they are being used to treat. These side effects are listed in Table 11. One important side effect that is sometimes forgotten is osteonecrosis. While corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis is more common in autoimmune diseases and transplant patients than in asthma, one should still have a high index of suspicion when treating an asthmatic child who has been on steroids for a long time [88]. Generally speaking, a short course of steroids to treat an asthma exacerbation is acceptable from a risk benefit standpoint. In this case, if the corticosteroid course is less than 7 days, no tapering of dose is needed. A tapering schedule should be formulated for those patients in whom steroids are being used for longer than 1 week. If the patient requires multiple courses of steroids, then the possibility of developing serious side effects should be considered.",

Short-acting \u03b2-agonists are widely used, whereby the child takes two puffs of an albuterol inhaler prior to exercising. This has the effect of shifting the stimulus response curve to the right. Inhaled albuterol or terbutaline provide relief for up to 1 h during exercise [89]. Other short-acting bronchodilators that have been used in EIA include fenoterol [90] and bitolterol [91]. Oral bronchodilators have provided longer relief, up to 6 h for albuterol [92] and 2\u20135 h for terbutaline [93]. Cromolyn and nedocromil have been found to protect against EIA for 120 and 300 min, respectively [94, 95]. Theophylline has also been used in EIA, but the narrow therapeutic window and the lack of benefit observed at lower doses has hindered its widespread use [96]. The use of ipratropium bromide in EIA has not produced consistent results [97]. Controller medications that have played a role in preventing EIA include inhaled corticosteroids and the long-acting bronchodilators salmeterol [98] and formoterol. Leukotriene receptor antagonists have also been shown to be of some value in preventing EIA in children [99].

The devices have undergone significant evolution since then and now are the most common device to carry drugs to treat asthma. Dry powder inhalers (DPI) are an alternative to metered dose inhalers. While the ability to deliver drug straight to the airways has revolutionized asthma treatment, the use of these devices in children presents some special considerations. The most important of these is the ability of young children to use these devices effectively. Specifically, this is the ability of the child to (1) understand how to use them and (2) be coordinated enough to use them accurately and effectively. Metered dose inhalers require considerable more coordination than DPIs, although spacer devices do help. If a child is found to be unable to effectively use one of these devices, then it would be much more beneficial to the asthmatic child to continue with the use of nebulizers. A comparison of the various drug delivery devices is shown in Table 16. The table also shows the most common age at which these inhalers can typically be used, although it is important to appreciate that there is a significant variability to these ages.\n\n",

Moreover, patients under the age of 20 years were three times more likely to improve than those more than 51 years of age [118]. Indications for immunotherapy include clear evidence of symptom\u2013exposure relationship, perennial symptoms, and inadequate control with medications.

However, if \u03b2-agonist nebulization is not effective in resolving respiratory distress, theophylline can be administered first as an intravenous bolus followed by a continuous intravenous drip. Once theophylline is started, the child should be admitted to the hospital. Each milligram per kilogram of theophylline IV bolus results in a 2-mg/dl rise in theophylline levels. The therapeutic window of theophylline serum levels is between 10 and 20 mg/dl. Thus, a commonly used bolus of 6 mg/kg results in a level that should fall well within the therapeutic window. An intravenous theophylline drip of 0.8\u20131 mg/kg/h will result in a steady-state serum level. Theophylline levels must be monitored carefully because of the serious side effects that can occur at higher serum levels (Table 11). Another disadvantage of using theophylline is that multiple factors can affect theophylline metabolism, sometimes leading to unpredictable serum levels. These factors are shown in Table 13.",

Environmental modulation can stem from allergenic exposure, exposure to other agents such as endotoxin, irritants, ozone, particulates, and even temperature.

Early experience in the USA suggests that it is of comparable efficacy to SCIT, but with significantly diminished side effects or risk of anaphylaxis. One potential drawback of SLIT compared to SCIT is the lack of supervision associated with self-administration of oral or sublingual preparations of extracts [155]. Better patient education may circumvent this objection, however, and SLIT may yet become widely used in the treatment of asthma. The other potential road block with SLIT is the absence of an established regimen for prescribing SLIT in polysensitized individual. A study of 51 polysensitized children with allergic rhinitis and/or mild to moderate asthma treated with SLIT for 1 year showed an improvement in symptoms of allergic rhinitis severity and classification, nasal, ocular, and bronchial symptoms and medication use. While the majority (42) of these children was treated with a single allergen, seven were treated with two or more extracts and experienced benefit as well [156]. Studies on the efficacy of SLIT have been done for dust mite [157, 158], Olea [159], grass pollen [160], and others.",

Multiple studies have shown that management by an asthma specialist (allergist or pulmonologist) leads to reduced morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life. Treatment by a specialist leads to fewer hospitalizations, fewer exacerbations requiring emergency care, better quality of life, and better outcomes [163]. However, the availability of financial resources and, more important, the failure to properly allocate such resources can be such an economic burden that optimal systems of healthcare are not implemented. As a result of this, many asthmatic children receive the bulk of their care from generalists and even mid-level practitioners, even in those cases where referral to a specialist may be indicated.",

Future research may be able to identify which treatment might be preferred based on the patient\u2019s pharmacogenetics, but we have not yet reached this point. Environmental control has become a mainstay in asthma treatment, and new modes of immunotherapy have contributed to a significant less morbidity over the past two or three decades.
