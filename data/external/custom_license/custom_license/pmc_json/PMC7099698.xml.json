However, IL-17A released by gamma delta cells was also shown to be important for the development of asthma.15 IL-17A is also involved in mucosal and epithelial host defense against fungi and extracellular bacteria.16, 17 Furthermore, Th17 cells and IL-17A seem also to modulate immune pathophysiology of viral infections.18",

The average age of controls and cases was 4.8 years (\u00b10.2 years). In total, 70.6% of the control children and 60% of the asthmatic children were males and thus 29.4% of the controls and 40% of children with asthma were females. By rating the severity of the disease according to Global initiative for Asthma guidelines (2005), 60% of the children have intermittent, 25% mild persistent, and 10% moderate persistent asthma. In 65% of the cases a viral infection was a triggering factor for the development of the disease. A combined treatment with steroid and non-steroid drugs was used by 50% of children with asthma. In 45% of the cases the asthma was controlled and partially controlled, respectively (see Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of the lung function of cases and controls showed that 76.5% of controls and only 40% of the cases had a FEV1 above 100%. Both, control and asthmatic children, suffered from several upper respiratory infections (e.g., common cold) during the last 12 months before they were included in the PreDicta (post-infectious immune reprogramming and its association with persistence and chronicity of respiratory allergic diseases) study. By contrast, children with asthma were more susceptible to infections of the lower respiratory tract such as pneumonia (50% compared with 5%) (see Supplementary Table S2). This can also be seen in Figure 1a, where the average number of lower respiratory infections during the last 12 months was significantly increased in cases compared with control children. Furthermore, control children as well as children with asthma suffered more often from upper respiratory infections than lower respiratory infections during the last 12 months before the time of recruitment (Figure 1a).",

Here, we detected an increased expression of the antiviral cytokine type I interferon-\u03b2 (IFNB) in the PBMCs of children with asthma and a positive RV test in their NPF at the time of recruitment (RV+; Figure 1b). Furthermore, we found that TBX21, the main transcription factor for IFNG24 and an inhibitor of IL-17A,25 was upregulated in the PBMCs of these children (Figure 1c). Finally, we found a perfect positive correlation between TBX21 and IFNB mRNA production in the PBMCs of these children with a RV infection in their NPF (Figure 1d and e). Consistent with the latter findings, the PBMCs of these children also released significantly less IL-17A compared with those isolated from asthmatic children without RV infection in their nasopharyngeal fluid (Figure 1f), at the same time point. Furthermore, by correlating the gene expression levels of TBX21 and IL17A in whole-blood samples (Figure 1g\u2013j), we could observe an inverse correlation between these two factors in control children without a viral infection in the upper airways (Figure 1g). In control children, the presence of RV in their NPF abolished this negative correlation (Figure 1h). By contrast, children with asthma and no RV infection in the upper airways showed only a slight inverse correlation between TBX21 and IL17A (Figure 1i), whereas the negative correlation was found in children with asthma and an additional viral infection in their NPF (Figure 1j).",

Therefore, we also analyzed OAS1 mRNA expression in the PBMCs of the PreDicta children at our department (MP-UK-ER). Here, we observed a significant downregulation of OAS1 gene expression in the PBMCs of children with asthma and an additional RV infection in the upper airways compared with asthmatic children without a viral infection (Figure 2a). As both factors, OAS1 and IL-17A, were decreased in asthmatic children with a RV infection in the upper airways, we thought about a direct impact of IL-17A on OAS1 expression. Therefore, we started to analyze the epithelial cell line A549, as airway epithelial cells are the first cell type encountered by infectious agents entering the airways. We then asked about the role of IL-17A on RV1b infection in lung epithelial cells. With this aim we infected the human lung epithelial cell line A549 with RV1b and then cultured them for 24 h with increasing concentrations of rhIL-17A. Here we found a significant upregulation of OAS1 gene expression after treating the A549 cells with 25 ng/ml of rhIL-17A (Figure 2b). To find out, if we could gain an even better induction of the antiviral immunity with higher concentrations of rhIL-17A, we treated the cells, after infection with RV1b, with up to 100 ng/ml rhIL-17A and concluded that 25 ng/ml of rhIL-17A were sufficient to reduce RV1b mRNA (Figure 2c). To determine whether IL-17A decreased RV1b expression via OAS1, we first treated A549 cells with OAS1 siRNA or non-targeting (NT) siRNA, infected them with RV1b, and afterwards cultured these cells with increasing concentrations of rhIL-17A. In these experiments, we also analyzed the impact of IL-17A concentrations inferior to 25 ng/ml on OAS1 gene expression. We could only observe a significant increase of OAS1 mRNA expression in A549 cells infected with RV1b and treated with NT siRNA and 25 ng/ml rhIL-17A compared with A549 cells infected with RV1b and treated with NT siRNA and lower amounts of rhIL-17A (Figure 2d and see Supplementary Figure S2). We could also observe that this effect was IL-17A dependent and RV1b independent, as we saw a similar induction after infection with UV-RV1b (see Supplementary Figure S2). Next, we measured RV1b mRNA expression in A549 cells infected with RV1b and treated with OAS1 siRNA and 25 ng/ml rIL17A. We found out that IL-17A had also in the absence of OAS1 an impact on viral replication, as we observed a significantly downregulation of RV1b mRNA expression in A549 cells transfected with OAS1 siRNA and 25 ng/ml rhIL-17A, indicating that IL-17A influences viral replication also by affecting other antiviral yet unidentified factors (Figure 2e). In conclusion, these experiments show that antiviral properties of IL-17A are linked at least in part to OAS1 in lung epithelial cells.",

In this model, we found that lung CD4+ T cells secreted significantly increased amounts of IL-17A when purified from the lung of OVA-sensitized mice (see Supplementary Figure S3a). Moreover, by using an invasive plethysmography method, we found a significant increase in AHR in Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) mice at lower doses of methacholine (MCh), whereas at higher doses of MCh the wild-type littermates showed an increased AHR as compared with the Il17a-deficient mice (see Supplementary Figure S3b). Consistent with a role of the Th2-type cytokines in allergic asthma, the Th2 cytokine IL-4 was found to be significantly induced in the airways of OVA-sensitized Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) mice as compared with wild-type littermates (see Supplementary Figure S3c). Consistent with this increase in IL-4 OVA-treated Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) mice showed a significant decrease of IFN-\u03b3 in BALF (see Supplementary Figure 3d). IL-5 and IL-13, two cytokines produced by Th2 cells and by the innate ILC2 cells,26, 27 were found to be similarly induced in the airways of OVA-sensitized wild-type and Il17a-deficient mice (see Supplementary Figure S 3e and f). Consistent with the levels of IL-5 in the airways, the amount of eosinophils was equivalent in OVA-sensitized Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) and wild-type mice (see Supplementary Figure S4a). By contrast, Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) OVA-sensitized mice have reduced neutrophils in their airways (see Supplementary Figure S4b) and a reduced number of mucus producing cells in the airways as compared with their wild-type littermates (see Supplementary Figure S4c). Both these latter components are known to be involved in the clearance of infectious microorganisms.28, 29 IL-4 is known to induce IgE immunoglobulin class switching in B cells.30 However, in our model system, the serum levels of IgE in OVA-sensitized Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) mice were comparable to those measured in the wild-type littermates (see Supplementary Figure S4d). We further investigated Batf mRNA expression, a transcription factor31 that is expressed in lymphocytes and is also involved in immunoglobulin rearrangements and thus in IgE induction in allergic asthma.32 Furthermore, it could be shown that BATF is increased in asthma.32 Consistently in this murine model of allergic asthma Batf mRNA was found to be increased in allergic asthma in an Il17a-independent manner (see Supplementary Figure S4e).",

Thus, we sorted out lung CD4+ T cells from OVA-sensitized wild-type and Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) mice and isolated total RNA and performed gene array analysis.

Furthermore, it could also be demonstrated that RV, in contrast to RSV, is able to directly infect and activate CD4+ T cells.35, 36, 37 To address the role of IL-17A during RV infection in asthma, we infected lung CD4+ T cells obtained from OVA-sensitized wild type and Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) mice with RV1b and cultured them for 24 h (Figure 3a).

Furthermore, confrontation with the allergen OVA resulted in a significant upregulation of the expression of this receptor in CD4+ T cells of wt mice, whereas Il17a-deficient CD4+ T cells show a downregulation of the Ldlr mRNA expression (Figure 3b). By using PCR analysis (see Supplementary Figure S6) we could confirm the infection with RV1b and after quantification of the PCR bands we found out that lung CD4+ T cells of na\u00efve Il17a (\u2212/\u2212) mice are more susceptible to viral infection than lung CD4+ T cells of na\u00efve wt mice (Figure 3c).

Subramaniam and colleagues3839 observed that IL-17A induced\u2014amongst others\u2014in a time-dependent manner the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 as well as of STAT1 and STAT2. This might be the underlying signaling mechanism by which IL-17A induces OAS1 gene expression. Furthermore, it is already known that IL-17A activates nuclear factor-\u03baB40 and this transcription factor is involved in the transcription of IFN-\u03b2,41 which in turn leads to the activation of antiviral factors such as OAS1 via JAK1/TYK2, STAT1/2 and IRF9. But our data also suggest that RV is able to inhibit the release of IL-17A and therefore escaping the immune system (Figure 4).To elucidate these molecular mechanisms in more detail, further investigations are needed.",

OAS1 activates RNaseL, which mediates RNA virus degradation.19, 20 The reduced release of IL-17A by the PBMCs of these children might be due to the induction of TBX21 in the PBMCs of these children, a transcription factor that is known to negatively regulate IL-17A.25 Furthermore, we found that IL-17A inhibited RV replication in human lung epithelial cell line infected with RV1b. We could also show that IL-17A upregulated OAS1 in this setting. This IL-17A/OAS1 pathway seems to be independent of IFNB, as we found increased expression of IFNB in children with asthma and an additional RV infection in their upper airways, whereas IL-17A and OAS1 were reduced. This observation is in line with previous findings on increased levels of INFB in PBMCs after infection with RV in vitro.42, 43 In contrast to these results in PBMCs, in bronchial epithelial cells and in the lung epithelial cell line A549 it has been previously reported that RV inhibits type I interferons.43, 44, 45, 46 Therefore, it is possible that epithelial cells, which are the first target of the RV, exhibit different immune response as compared with PBMCs.

However, we found increased IL-4 levels and decreased IFN-\u03b3 in the lung of Il17a-deficient mice which could explain the different responses to MCh.

Similarly to what we observed in the PBMCs of asthmatic children, RV1b reduces IL-17A production in infected CD4+ T cells from OVA-sensitized mice. This results in IL-17A deprivation which cannot anymore signal in cells of the innate immune response like epithelial cells. We further demonstrated that IL-17A via OAS1 activation shreds the RV RNA which replicates preferentially in epithelial cells. These findings have important implication for the treatment of RV-induced asthma in children.",

In the nucleus, OAS1 (2\u20325\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1) is transcribed upon induction of IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs). In the cell cytoplasm OAS1 protein accumulates as an inactive monomer. Upon binding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the enzyme oligomerizes to form a catalytic active tetramer. This active form synthesizes 2\u20325\u2032 oligoadenylates (2-5A) using ATP as substrate. 2-5A binds to inactive RNaseL and triggers the dimerization of monomers. RNaseL then degrades RNA of viral and also cellular origin.
