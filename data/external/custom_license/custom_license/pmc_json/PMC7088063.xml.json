However, no matter if the fusion tags are large or small, they will possibly interfere with the structure or normal functions of the fused proteins (Horchani et al. 2009). Therefore, protein tags sometimes need to be removed by chemical agents, proteases or possibly self-splicing intein. For example, ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) have been expressed with SUMO fusion technology and purified with Ni-NTA but the SUMO-tag needs to be cleaved for further NMR studies (Rutkowska et al. 2009).",

Ulp1 was the first described SUMO protease in S. cerevisiae (Li and Hochstrasser 1999). It can cleave the epsilon-linked peptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of the mature SUMO and the lysine epsilon-amino group of the target protein (Malakhov et al. 2004). Ulp1 is expressed in soluble form, it is easy to use and is widely used for protein purification. However, there are some problems for the application of Ulp1: the activity of Ulp1 is gradually lost during preservation especially after long time storage, even at \u221280 \u00b0C. Free Ulp1 cannot be reused, and further purification process is needed to remove Ulp1 and SUMO from cleaved proteins.",

As for the free Ulp1, its activity was sharply decreased with DMSO up to 5% (v/v). We also examined the influence of ethanol (Fig. 2b) and found both free and immobilized Ulp1 work well when ethanol was up to 20% (v/v). Stability in these solvents indicates that DMSO or ethanol can be added to minimize bacterial growth and be useful for some catalyzing and modification reactions (Yang et al. 2014). Interestingly, SUMO was degraded when no DMSO was added while no perspective degradation existed after 10% DMSO was added (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, presumably the existence of DMSO prevented the degradation of cleaved SUMO. Both free and immobilized Ulp1 are resistant to some small molecules such as NaCl, imidazole, DTT and urea (Supplementary Fig. 3a\u2013d). These properties will be helpful for purifying some specific proteins (Rutkowska et al. 2009).\n",

With storage at 25 \u00b0C free Ulp1 maintained about 50% of its initial activity over 7 days (data not shown) but lost 77% of its activity after 14 days, whereas only 7% decreasing of activity for the immobilized Ulp1 within the same period (Fig. 3b). Immobilized Ulp1 also showed good stability at 4 and 30 \u00b0C (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, cleaved SUMO (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 4) was degraded which is consistent to the speculation that DMSO will prevent degradation of cleaved SUMO. The cleavage efficiency of Ulp1 usually increases with the increase of temperature, the optimum temperature is generally 25\u201337 \u00b0C, and increasing hydrolysis time can reduce the cost of Ulp1. Ulp1 used in its immobilized form has greatly enhanced thermal stability and can be utilized in rapid cleavage and industrial applications (Kokufuta 1992).\n",

The immobilized Ulp1 retained full activity at pH 4.5\u20138.5, only a slightly activity decreasing at pH 10.5. It seems that Ulp1 is an acid-tolerant protease and immobilization enhances its pH stability. Carrier-bound active group (CAG) used here was NHS. NHS can react with amino group of lysines to form stable amido bond and may improve structural stability of immobilized Ulp1 (Ferreira et al. 2003).\n",
