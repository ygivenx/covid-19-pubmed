In 1915, the Rockefeller Foundation decided, based on its studies of Asian countries, to establish a first-rate medical college in Beijing. The Foundation acquired all the assets of the Union Medical College from the London Missionary Society and then purchased all the real estates of a royal palace in Dong Dan San Tiao hutong in downtown Beijing. It took USD 7.5 million to build this complex of 22.6-ha coverage, comprising 14 buildings of the college, hospital, offices, an auditorium, power room, etc. The complex was designed and built as a classic Chinese architecture featuring glazed tiles, upturned eaves, carved beams, and painted rafters to add to the bright coloring (Fig. 2). All these were in harmony with the constructing style of Beijing as an ancient capital city of China. The interior was designed and decorated at the highest standards of the time to meet medical education, medical services, and medical research needs. PUMC was unparalleled in Asia for its library collection at the time. Most noteworthy of all was its elites of entrepreneurship recruited as executives, managers, and discipline leaders, from not only the USA but also UK, Canada, and within China. They were mostly young and vigorous people; for example, the first dean Franklin McLeam was only 28 years old when he took office. For these young people born in industrialized countries, it challenged their courage and dedication to come to China, a nation in the east so mysterious and remote at that time. September 15\u201322, 1921 witnessed a solemn opening ceremony of Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), attended by principals and professors from China, other Asian countries, Europe, and America, as well as 50 delegates from academic associations and international health organizations.\n\n\n",

The guidelines for PUMC were established in view of the conditions and requirements specific of China: build a first-rate medical college to educate first-class medical professionals of clinicians, medical educationists, medical scientists, and public health administrators, contributing to medical science in China and medicine of the world. In this regard, the capacity of PUMC was designed as 30 students per class (50 at maximum), a scale matched by its classrooms and laboratories. Peking Union Medical College\u2019s hospital (PUMCH), a hospital designed as 250 beds, was open to admit in-patients since June 1921. Founded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the nursing school of PUMC was also the best in China, which is known for its advanced teaching methodology, education quality, especially its courses on public healthcare, which are followed by counterparts in the country. To ensure the command of natural sciences and English proficiency of the students, PUMC established pre-medical programs in a number of universities in China. Other characteristics of PUMC include the \u201cknock-out\u201d mechanism in the entrance exam, teaching in English, emphasis of hands-on practice, and public health courses, with which PUMC became the pioneer of an 8-year curriculum on medical education and undergraduate nursing programs in China.",

As early as PUMC was founded, scientific research had been earmarked as one of its key commitments. A recruitment policy was clearly laid down that senior teachers must be capable of both education and scientific research, a policy adhered to as of now. Another policy for research subjects insisted on the emphasis of significant and pressing issues in medicine and healthcare specific of China. PUMC was a major contributor of first-class academic publications carried on prestigious medical magazines such as Chinese Medical Journal (Chinese/English edition) and Chinese Journal of Physiology at that time. Papers and reports were also frequently published on overseas medical journals. For example, the world-known discovery and studies of \u201cPeking Man\u201d skulls made by Professor Black Davidson of anthropology of the Department of Anatomy based on the fossil teeth excavated from Zhoukoudian in Beijing. Invention and studies of ephedrine, translation and study of the Compendium of Materia Medica (the most famous work on Traditional Chinese Medicine in Ming Dynasty), biochemical inspection, and study of blood, all of which effectively propelled the development of medical research in China.",
