            "text": "When operating on the human body (electro-) mechanical tools are often used. Although cutting incidents with sharps or needles are well known health hazards, inhalation of surgical smoke or aerosols (solid or liquid airborne particles) produced by tools is often overlooked and can lead to, for example, respiratory irritations, transmission of infections, and genotoxicity [1]. Safety awareness for high risk airborne transmissible pathogens such as tuberculosis (TB) [2] or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) does exist [3], however, the health risks associated with the aerosolization of pathogens in the skin, blood or other bodily material remain uncertain. These aerosolized pathogens could include Hepatitis B and C, Streptococci, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), of which airborne transmissions are rare but have been reported or proven plausible during surgery or autopsy sessions [4]. Additionally, non-pathogen-carrying aerosols can pose health hazards when inhaled and deposited in the airways, as with industry smog, car exhaust gas, cigarette smoke or urban pollution [5].",

It was found that active ventilation within the tested autopsy table can remove nearly all of these aerosol dust particles from the air. A proper choice of sawing parameters could minimize the production of aerosols: sawing by hand using a sharp, fine toothed hacksaw was found to be the best option. When an electric oscillating saw is used, decreasing the saw blade frequency or increasing the saw blade contact load can be used to minimize aerosol production. However, even for the parameters with the lowest production this intrinsic decrease in particles is slight, and the number of aerosol bone particles that are produced still pose a serious health hazard to anyone near the sawing site. Adequate protective breathing gear, ventilation systems and safety protocols should be used to minimize the risks faced by practitioners.",
