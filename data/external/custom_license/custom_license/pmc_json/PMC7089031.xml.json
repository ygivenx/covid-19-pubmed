Domestic chicken is the most important but not the only host for IBV [1]. IB has been reported in peafowl, teal, partridge, turkey, pheasant, racing pigeon, and guinea fowl [2\u20135]. IBV is the prototype of Coronaviridae, which is a diverse family consists of three groups based on genetic and serologic properties [6, 7]. IBV belongs to Coronaviridae group 3, which differs extensively from group 1 and group 2 that are consisting of mammalian coronaviruses.",

The whole IBV genome has at least 10 open reading frames (ORF), from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 are as follows: 5\u2032-1a-1b-S(S1,S2)-3a,b,c(E)-M-5a,b-N-Poly(A)-3\u2032, consisting of four main structural proteins (glycosylation spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N)) and numerous non-structural proteins of known and unknown functions [1, 9\u201312]. S protein was cleavaged into N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 glycopolypeptides. The S1 spike glycoprotein carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific antigenic determinants, which can evolve rapidly especially within the three hypervariable regions (HVR). S2 protein anchors to viron and can affect S1 protein fusion to membrane. N protein plays important role in virus replication, assembly, and cell immunity. E and M proteins are required in virus assembly and budding. Gene 1 codes two polymerase proteins 1a and 1b, which are incised into 15 non-structural proteins (nsp) and are associated with RNA replication and transcription. NS proteins, encoded by gene 3 and gene 5, are not essential in virus replication, but they may play a role in antagonism of innate immune responses. They can also serve as targets for rational attenuation of IBV pathogenicity [1, 8, 13\u201316].",

Choosing appropriate vaccine to control IB infection is very important due to the poor cross-protection among the different serotypes. In North America, the mainly used vaccines are Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Arkansas serotypes. California strains and other important region serotypes are also used. In Europe, various \u201cHolland variants\u201d are available. In Australia, native B and C serotypes are used to control IB.",

All gene 1 fragments of A2 had highest identity with S14, except for nsp9 and nsp11-nsp13 (Table 3). For nsp9 and nsp11-nsp13, A2 was 97.1% and 93.2% identical to BJ, whereas was 97.0% and 92.2% identical to S14, respectively. Nsp2 is the putative 3C-like proteinase (3C-LP), also known as the main proteinase (Mpro), which plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication as well as in proteolytic processing of gene 1-encoded polyproteins in coronaviruses. Between different IBVs 3C-LP is highly conserved [25\u201327]. But compared with other gene 1 fragments in this study, nucleotide identity between A2 and other strains for 3C-LP was relatively low.\n",
