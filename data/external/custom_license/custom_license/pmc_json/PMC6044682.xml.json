On the basis of our experience, the AAO surface\nto be used in glycan microarrays should have the following properties:\n(1) The aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) layer should be smooth enough for\nthe covalent coupling reaction with sugar derivatives of phosphonic\nacid.29,30 (2) The thickness of the Al-oxide layer\non the surface should be adjusted to provide optimal fluorescence\nintensity for the detection of the protein\u2013sugar interaction.\nIn this study, we use the glass slide with electron-beam (E-beam)-coated\naluminum to produce ACG slides with various thicknesses under various\nanodization conditions and then study their effect on the fluorescence\nintensity in sugar\u2013protein interactions. Mannose with an \u03b1-5-pentylphosphonic\nacid tail was\nused as a model compound for covalent attachment to the Al-oxide layer,\nand the fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor-488-tagged ConA (ConA-A488)\nthat interacts with the covalently bound sugar was used to evaluate\nand optimize the system. Computer software\nwas used to design experiments to fabricate the surface with various\nthicknesses and roughness of the AAO layer for the study. Data analysis\nof the result was conducted mathematically and used for the development\nof optimized conditions for the preparation of ACG slides.",

These\nVDP screening studies included (1) Al-oxide of 50 nm thickness produced\nusing atomic layer deposition onto the Al-coated (with e-beam evaporation)\nglass slide; (2) Al-oxide of 2 nm thickness obtained from direct oxygen\nplasma treatment on a 300 nm thick aluminum (with e-beam evaporation)\ncoated on glass slides; and (3) Al-oxide of 36 nm thickness produced\nusing magnetron sputtering on the Al-coated (with magnetron sputtering),\nthe nickel-coated (with e-beam evaporation), or the chromium-coated\n(with e-beam evaporation) glass slides. All of these substrates were\nexamined using the GenePix fluorescent scanner. The original purpose\nof screening diversified methods was to create different Al-oxide\nmicrostructures on the surface to identify an optimal way to enhance\nthe signal. However, the best fluorescence intensity produced from\nthese slides was the AAO grown on glass slides. Without further investigation\nof the VDP techniques, we then focused on the use of E-beam evaporation\nwith argon plasma to coat a layer of pure aluminum on the glass slide\nfollowed by acid anodization of the aluminum surface. Our pervious\nstudy15 showed that the slide surface roughness\nwith rms (root mean square) < 18 nm can be used for microarray\nprinting. Schott\u2019s glass slides provided a smooth surface (rms\n0.33\u20130.42 nm scanned using AFM over 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm2 area) for aluminum coating. The Al-coated glass slides produced\nin this way have a smooth surface with a rms of 0.75 nm (for 100 nm)\nand 2.33 nm (for 300 nm) of coated aluminum. An optimized AAO surface\ngave a rms of 2.31 nm, with surface roughness similar to that of the\nAl-coated glass slide. The same results were obtained when glass slides\nwith higher rms were used for Al-oxide preparation. We believe that\nduring the electrochemical surface anodization, the electropolishing\nprocess42\u221244 occurred simultaneously to remove the convex, sharp,\nand rough materials from the surface. Therefore, a thin layer of AAO\nwith surface roughness similar to glass can be prepared under the\noptimized surface anodization reaction condition.",

Figure 8D shows\nthe analysis of spot 1\u20135 (the first row and the fifth spot\ncounting from the right) of ACG versus NHS slides as shown in Figure 8A,B. The result from\nthe GenePix scanner recorded the spot dimension (Dia.), average fluorescence\nintensity per pixel (F488 Mean) with standard deviation (F488 SD),\ntotal fluorescence intensity of the spot (F488 total intensity), percentage\nsaturation (F488% sat.), and coefficient of variation within the spot\n(F488 CV) are tabulated in Figure 8D. Even though the individual pixel intensity cannot\nbe resolved visually with the naked eye, the coefficient of variation\nof pixel intensities (F488 CV) of 17 versus 65 indicates that the\nConA-A488/mannose distribution within a specific array spot on the\nACG slide is more uniform than that on the NHS glass slide.",
