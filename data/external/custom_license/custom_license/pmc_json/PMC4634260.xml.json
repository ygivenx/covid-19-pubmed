This finding may suggest that for future efforts in assessing the economic impacts of a respiratory disease, the measurement of infection duration should be taken into account as a proxy for economic burden. Of the four variables that increased the number of healthcare visits with an ILI, we believe that two of them (living in a detached house and having working parents) are associated with potentially higher socio\u2010economic status. In the literature, it is evident that those of higher economic class are more likely to seek medical visits for their health issues.23, 24, 25 However, our study did not collect related information to prove the potential link between socio\u2010economic status and health\u2010seeking behaviours.",

The use of RT\u2010PCR has contributed to ongoing discovery/detection of simultaneous multiple respiratory pathogens from a single specimen in one child,26 but the real impact of these simultaneous detections remains unclear. There are some reports documenting that (i) the single infection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and (ii) the co\u2010infection of HMPV plus respiratory syncytial virus increase hospitalisation rates,27, 28 while other studies did not detect an association between a multiple viral infections and illness severity.29, 30, 31 Future research should endeavour to better correlate clinical/economic disease severity with viral quantity.",

The recreation time loss is likely to cause opportunity costs, which needs to be assessed in an economic analysis.",

This may be due to inflation, different methods of valuing time and the fact that our study included a higher proportion of families where both parents worked (89% in this study versus 49% in Lambert et al.8).
