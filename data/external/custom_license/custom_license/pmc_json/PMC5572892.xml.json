However, instead of finding ferret HEV particles, we observed many coronavirus-like particles in fractions 4, 5, and 6, with densities of 1.230 g/cm3, 1.214 g/cm3, and 1.198 g/cm3 (data not shown). These particles ranged from 60 nm to 120 nm in diameter; most of them had a spike structure, suggesting that the ferrets were infected with a CoV-like virus.",

The coronaviruses have a pseudoknot tertiary structure that allows a ribosomal shift of the reading frame between ORF1a and ORF1b (7\u20139).
