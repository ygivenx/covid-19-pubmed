HCoV-OC43 belongs to subgroup A of the betacoronaviruses. These are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a large genome size at 30,780 bases [1]. The viral proteins that contribute to the structure of coronaviruses include the Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N), Envelope (E) and Spike (S) glycoprotein. Betacoronaviruses possess a unique protein on the surface alongside the S glycoprotein called Hemagglutinin esterase (HE). Each coronavirus possesses its own set of unique accessory proteins. The accessory proteins of HCoV-OC43 are called ns2a and ns5a [2].",

Subclinical or very mild infections are common, and can occur throughout the year. However, human coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are responsible for 10 to 20% of hospitalisations of young children and immunocompromised adults with respiratory tract illness [7]. HCoV-OC43 seems to have also the potential for both neurotropism and neuroinvasion that are associated with multiple sclerosis [8, 9]. Moreover, HCoV-OC43 was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of a child with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [10]. A case of fatal encephalitis associated with HCoV-OC43 infection was recently reported in an immunodeficient 11-month-old boy [11].",

In Vero E6 cells expressing SARS-CoV N protein, interleukin 6 (IL6) was activated through nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) [12]. On the contrary, the M protein of SARS-CoV suppresses NF-\u03baB activity and contributes to the pathogenesis of the virus [13]. In addition, many proteins in SARS-CoV were shown to have the ability to antagonise interferon (IFN) and counteract the innate immune response. The ORF3b and ORF6 accessory proteins have the potential to antagonise IFN by different mechanisms [14]. SARS-CoV M protein was recently shown to suppress IFN production [15]. The structural and accessory proteins M, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 of MERS-CoV were shown to be potent IFN antagonists [16, 17]. It is still unknown whether the evasion mechanisms described above have a certain role in the severity of SARS and MERS. It is noteworthy that several people infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV do not develop severe symptoms [18\u201321].",

None of the studies conducted so far have compared results with those of HCoV-OC43 that is associated with low mortality rate. HCoV-OC43 may have the same ability as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to evade innate immunity. Indeed, there are few studies investigating HCoV-OC43 interaction with host cells and the innate immune response. The N protein was shown to cause prolonged activation of NF-\u03baB in N-expressing HEK-293T cells [22]. Furthermore, HCoV-OC43 infection of cell lines derived from human respiratory tract epithelia and hepatocytes, was enhanced by all three types of IFN, due to the interaction with the IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins [23]. Moreover, the acetyl-esterase activity of HE protein strongly enhances the production of infectious virus [24].",

The antiviral gene expression in transfected HEK-293 cells expressing one HCoV-OC43 protein was compared to that in mock- and non-transfected cells. Only the expression of the oncogene FOS was upregulated across all samples (Table 1). Nevertheless, over 30 genes were downregulated in the presence of one of the HCoV-OC43 proteins, e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP3K7), toll-like receptors (TLR3 and TLR8), caspases (CASP1), cathepsins (CTSS), interferons (IFNA1), interleukins (IL1B, IL12A, IL15, and IL18), and signaling transduction proteins (MYD88 and MAVS) (Table 1). Similar results were obtained in the presence of the influenza A NS1 protein, a well-known IFN antagonist [14] (Table 1). The mean negative fold change for CARD9 in the presence of the structural protein M or N was larger than that in the presence of the accessory protein ns2a (p < 0.01). In contrast, the expression of the MAP3K7 gene was more downregulated in the presence of ns2a or ns5a protein than in the presence of M or N protein (p < 0.01). Downregulation of CTSS gene expression was greater in the presence of ns2a, ns5a or N protein than in the presence of M protein (p < 0.01). IL1B, CASP1, and TLR3 gene expression was more downregulated in the presence of ns2a or ns5a protein than in the presence of M or N protein (p < 0.01). On the contrary, CD86 was more downregulated in the presence of M protein than in the presence of N, ns2a or ns5a protein (p \u2264 0.01).\n\n",

HCoV-OC43 ns5a accessory protein is known to be a viroporin involved in virion morphogenesis and pathogenesis [30]. In its absence, there is a reduction of virulence, inflammation and replication in infected mice [30]. Murine coronavirus accessory protein 5a is homologous to ns5a protein, and it has been found to antagonise IFN induction [31]. Our results showed that the expression of PRRs, IFNA1, IRF7, MYD88, and MAVS, all important for the induction of an antiviral response, was downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 accessory proteins ns2a and ns5a. Moreover, the expression of interleukins, chemokines, FOS, JUN, IRFs, and IFNA1 was downregulated in the presence of ns5a protein. FOS and JUN are transcription factors involved in the induction of inflammatory cytokines [32, 33]. Altogether, our results suggest HCoV-OC43 ns2a and ns5a have the potential to induce a shift towards an anti-inflammatory response and blockage of the type I IFN pathway. However, in vivo studies are required to confirm the type of immune response HCoV-OC43 elicits during infection. In the absence of adequate immune responses, the virus will be able to replicate and spread freely.",

SARS-CoV M protein suppresses the activation of NF-\u03baB [13]. It can also halt IFN production by blocking the formation of the TRAF3 complex [15]. MERS-CoV M protein is also a potent IFN antagonist, targeting the TRAF3-TBK1 interaction to inhibit phosphorylation of IRF3 [17, 35]. Moreover, TRAF6, TRADD and FADD are key players in the NF-\u03baB and apoptosis pathways [36]. Our results showed that the expression of TRAF6 was downregulated in the presence of M or other tested HCoV-OC43 proteins, but this downregulation could not be confirmed after stimulation with Sendai virus. In contrast, the downregulation of TRADD was only observed after challenge with Sendai virus. However, the expression of FADD was not downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43M protein before or after challenge with Sendai virus. Furthermore, the expression of MAVS, MYD88, IRFs and IFNA1 that are essential in the induction of the type I IFN signaling pathway, was downregulated in the presence of M protein. This suggests that HCoV-OC43M protein has similar downregulatory effects on the induction of type I IFN and NF-\u03baB as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M protein. Further studies are needed to confirm the effects of HCoV-OC43M protein on the type I IFN and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.",

TAK1 is a protein kinase known to be a critical mediator of the inflammatory response as it is activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other TLR/NLR agonists, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 [41]. Binding of IL-1 and LPS to their receptors activates TAK1 through a common pathway whereby the kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4 recruit TRAF6. TNF-\u03b1 activates TAK1 via a similar mechanism, which is mediated by RIP1 and TRAF2. Activation of TRAF2 and TRAF6 leads to the generation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which bind to the adaptor proteins TAB2 or TAB3. TAK1 is bound constitutively to the accessory protein TAB1 and to the homologs TAB2 or TAB3. Once activated, TAK1 transduces the signal to NF-\u03baB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 via phosphorylation of IKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4/7 (MKK4/7), and MKK3/6, respectively. Ultimately, NF-\u03baB and other transcription factors downstream of p38 and JNK are activated, resulting in the transcription of genes important for inflammatory and immune responses. Interestingly, Protein kinase R (PKR) interacts with TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 as a scaffold protein to mediate TLR3-dependent NF-\u03baB and MAPK activation [42, 43]. The strong downregulation of TAK1 expression observed in our study could be due to: 1) the inhibition of TAK1 expression by direct interaction of HCoV-OC43 protein with TAK1 preventing binding of other mediators like TRAF2/6 or TAB2/3; 2) the upregulation of expression of negative regulators of TAK1 like PP2C or PP6 phosphatases, and deubiquitinases such as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 4 (USP4) [41].",

Our study showed that all tested HCoV-OC43 proteins were able to downregulate the expression of IFNA1, suggesting resistance to IFN-\u03b1 induction. The interaction between HCoV-OC43 proteins and the host cell requires further investigation to understand the processes that could contribute to overall resistance to the antiviral state. Having all these HCoV-OC43 proteins with potential inhibitory effects expressed in close proximity in infected cells indicates a high replicative capacity of the virus.",

While SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to induce proinflammatory cytokines in vitro [44, 45], HCoV-OC43 accessory and structural proteins have the potential to inhibit inflammatory response in HEK-293 cells. Further studies are in progress to confirm the role of HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins in antagonising antiviral gene expression, and to elucidate the nature of the immune response and the level of inflammation seen during HCoV-OC43 infection.\n",
