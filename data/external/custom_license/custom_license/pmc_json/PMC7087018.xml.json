A genetic cause was suspected and parents gave permission to study the genes encoding the most important alternative complement pathway proteins (factor H, factor I, membrane cofactor protein, complement factor B [CFB], and C3). In both siblings, a previously unknown deletion of one nucleotide was identified in exon 21 of the gene encoding C3 (c.2696delT, p.Val899AlafsX5). This mutation causes a frameshift, leading to a preliminary stop (five amino acids after the deletion) in the MG7 domain of the protein. The mutant protein is almost 46 % shorter than wild-type C3, resulting in the loss of important binding sites for CFB and the loss of the thioester bond important for the function of the protein (Fig. 1) [5]. Genomic DNA analysis in both parents showed a maternal inheritance; the mother of the twins is generally healthy, but recalls being frequently sick and suffering from upper respiratory tract infections as a child.\n",
