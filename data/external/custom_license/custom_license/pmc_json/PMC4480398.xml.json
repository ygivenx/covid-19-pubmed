The nasal swab samples were placed in virus transport medium and later tested by real-time PCR targeting open-reading frame 1a and upstream of envelope protein gene, as previously described (7); all samples were negative for MERS-CoV RNA. The serum samples were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV antibody by using a validated MERS-CoV (strain EMC) spike pseudoparticle neutralization test (8); no samples were positive, indicating a lack of recent or past MERS-CoV infection. A random sample of 5 serum samples each from camels in Umnugovi and Dundgovi Provinces was tested by using a microneutralization test against bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as previously described (8); all 10 samples were positive (titer range 1:20\u20131:640).",

Thus, the negative test results indicate that MERS-CoV is not circulating among Bactrian camels in southern Mongolia. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV among adult dromedaries in the Middle East and Africa is typically >90%, so the lack of any serologic reactivity in camels from Mongolia implies that MERS-CoV infection does not infect Bactrian camels or that the geographic range of the virus does not extend to northeastern Asia. In contrast, infection with a BCoV-like coronavirus seems ubiquitous in Bactrian camels, as it is in dromedaries (7).",

So far, Australia is the only country where dromedaries appear to be free of MERS-CoV; however, as with dromedaries elsewhere, dromedaries in Australia are infected by a BCoV-like virus (8). Dromedaries in Australia originated from Afghanistan; these camels were shipped to Australia in the early part of the twentieth century to work on railroad construction projects. There are 2 plausible explanations for the lack of MERS-CoV in Australia: the small numbers of adult animals that were transported from Afghanistan to Australia might not have been sufficient to introduce the virus into Australia or the virus might have been absent from dromedaries in Afghanistan.",
