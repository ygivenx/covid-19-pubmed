            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an important disease throughout the world, leading to significant economic losses in pig production (Neumann et al. 2005; Tong et al. 2007). PRRS virus (PRRSV) was identified as the etiological agent of the disease (Thiel et al. 1993). PRRSV genome is a positive-strand RNA of approximately 15,000 nucleotides, comprising 8 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 is comprised of two large overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b (Meulenberg et al. 1993; Thiel et al. 1993). ORF1a is translated directly whereas ORF1b is translated by a ribosomal frame shift, yielding a large ORF1ab polyprotein that is cleaved by virus-encoded proteinases into products related to the virus transcription and replication (Allende et al. 1999). After the autocatalytic release of nonstructural protein 1\u03b1 (Nsp1\u03b1), Nsp1\u03b2 and Nsp2, the remainder of the ORF1ab polyprotein is cleaved into at least 10 nonstructural proteins (Nsp3\u201312) by Nsp4 (Ziebuhr et al. 2000). PRRSV Nsp4 belongs to the 3C-like serine proteinases (3CLSP), or 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro). The predicted catalytic triad of PRRSV 3CLpro consists of His39, Asp64, and Ser118 (numbered according to the Nsp4 amino acid sequence) (Snijder et al. 1996). The three-dimensional structure of PRRSV 3CLpro has recently been determined by X-ray crystallography (Tian et al. 2009), which makes it possible to identify amino acid residues on its active site by using site-directed mutagenesis assay.",

In contrast with this finding in PRRSV, high concentrations of Na+ strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of 3CLpros of the Chiba strain of Norovirus and equine arteritis virus (Someya et al. 2005; van Aken et al. 2006). K+ (500 mM) did not inhibit proteolytic activity either (data not shown). Neither did Mn2+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ at 5 mM (102, 95, and 103%, respectively), suggesting that PRRSV 3CLpro might be located or work in a confined environment inside infected cells rather than spreading throughout the whole cells. Further study is necessary to elucidate where and how PRRSV 3CLpro works in infected cells. Cu2+ and Zn2+ at 5 mM decreased the proteolytic activity to 62 or 50% (Fig. 5b). Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibit several viral proteinases, such as 3CLpros of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus and norovirus (Hsu et al. 2004; Someya et al. 2005). These results may facilitate designing anti-PRRSV drugs that contain metal ion-conjugated compounds, which have been used in 3CL protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV (Hsu et al. 2004).\n",

The proteolytic activity of exfoliative toxin A, which is also a serine proteinase, has been reported to depend on Cu2+ (Sakurai and Kondo 1978). The proteolytic activity of PRRSV 3CLpro may also depend on the presence of some divalent cations. Antipain, leupeptin, TPCK, E-64 and benzamidine did not show significant inhibitory effect.\n",

The proteolytic activities of these mutant proteins were measured in the trans-cleavage assay described above. As expected, all the substitutions of amino acids His39, Asp64 and Ser118 abolished the proteolytic activity (Fig. 7). In a previous study, substitution of the predicted nucleophilic Ser118 with Ala in PRRSV 3CLpro produced an inactive enzyme (Tian et al. 2009). The X-ray crystal structure of PRRSV 3CLpro revealed that the protein folded into two \u03b2-barrel structures (domains I and II), typical of the catalytic domain of chymotrypsin-like proteinases. The canonical catalytic site was located at the opening of the cleft between domains I and II and consisted of residues His39, Asp64 and Ser118 (Tian et al. 2009). Taken together, these results supported the prediction that His39, Asp64 and Ser118 formed the catalytic triad of PRRSV 3CLpro (Snijder et al. 1996).\n",
