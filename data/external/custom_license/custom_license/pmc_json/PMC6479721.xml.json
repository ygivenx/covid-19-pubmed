            "text": "To develop PLANT-Dx, we first sought to create pathogen detecting\nmolecular sensors based upon the Small Transcription Activating RNA\n(STAR) regulatory system.11 This transcription\nactivation system is based upon conditional formation of a terminator hairpin located within a target\nRNA upstream of a gene to be regulated: alone, the terminator hairpin\nforms and interrupts transcription of the downstream gene, while in\nthe presence of a specific trans-acting STAR the\nhairpin cannot form and transcription proceeds (Figure S2). Previous work showed that the STAR linear binding\nregion can be changed to produce highly functional and orthogonal\nvariants.15 Here we sought to utilize this\nby replacing the linear binding region with sequences derived from\ngenomic pathogen RNA to create new viral sensors. To do this, we utilized\nthe secondary structure prediction algorithm NUPACK to identify regions\nwithin the genomes of CMV and PVY, that are predicted computationally\nto be unstructured for target RNA design (Note S1).16 Once viral STARs were designed,\nreporter DNA constructs were then created in which these target sequences\nwere placed downstream of a constitutive E. coli promoter and upstream of the CDO reporter gene coding sequence.\nWe next designed RPA primer sets to amplify and transform a pathogen\u2019s\ngenomic material into a DNA construct capable of synthesizing a functional\nSTAR. Specifically, a T7 promoter and antiterminator STAR sequence\nwere added to the 5\u2032 end of a reverse RPA primer, which when\ncombined with a forward primer, amplified an approximately 80 nucleotide\n(nt) viral sequence to produce a double-stranded DNA encoding the\ndesigned STAR which contained the target viral sequence. In this way,\nwe anticipated that combining the CDO-encoding reporter construct\nand RPA amplified DNA into a cell-free gene expression reaction12,17 would lead to the production of a detectable colorimetric output\nsignal.",

We observed rapid color\naccumulation in samples containing 1 nM of purified transcription\nproduct versus the no-RNA negative control (Figure 1b). To test for modularity,\nwe further developed sensors and primer sets for the detection of PVY,\nand confirmed function with the same assay (Figure 1c). The specificity of our system was also\ntested by interrogating the crosstalk between the product of various\nRPA reactions and noncognate molecular sensors. Specifically, we tested\ncolor production from cell-free reactions containing the reporter\nDNA construct for CMV with the PVY IVT-derived RPA product, as well\nas the converse, and found color production only between cognate pairs\nof input RPA and reporter constructs (Figure 1d). We next interrogated the inherent limit\nof detection of our system through titration of input IVT products\n(Figure 1e) and found\nit to be between 44pM and 4.4pM of input IVT RNA material. This demonstrated\nour ability to detect the presence of target nucleic acid sequences\ndown to the picomolar range. Surprisingly, this sensitivity is lower\nthan that previously reported for RPA3 and\nis most likely due to loss in amplification efficiency from the addition\nof the long overhangs present within our primer sets.",

To test\nthis, we input 1 \u03bcL of CMV-infected plant lysate, or\nan equivalent volume of a noninfected plant lysate control, into the\nPLANT-Dx reaction system. Here, we observed rapid color change only\nfrom reactions with infected lysate when compared to healthy lysate\n(Figure 2a). Interestingly,\nthe leak in the system was reduced when challenged with plant extract\nin comparison to previous results using IVT product. This is most\nlikely due to a slightly inhibitory effect plant lysate may have on\nthe efficiency of the RPA reaction and presents a positive benefit\nof reducing off target signal production. Despite the great benefits\nderived from colorimetric enzymes, their usage dictates that any leak\nin the system will eventually result in the complete conversion of\nsubstrate into a visible signal. Therefore, it is important to determine\na time point cutoff in which to analyze data for the presence or absence\nof the color signal to minimize false positives associated with expression\nleak. In this work using PLANT-Dx for detection of CMV, we suggest\nutilizing 150 min (Figure 1a). To demonstrate that this assay can be monitored by eye,\nreactions were carried out and filmed within a 31 \u00b0C incubator\n(Figure 2b). With the\nnaked eye, we detected accumulation of a yellow color only within\nreactions that were incubated with infected lysate, while no such\nproduction was observed in reactions with uninfected lysate.",

Building\noff of previously elucidated STAR design rules,15 we have shown that our molecular sensors can be efficiently\ndesigned, built, and implemented for use in this important plant diagnostic\ncontext. The use of STARs in PLANT-Dx complements previous uses of\ntoehold translational switches for similar purposes in human viral\ndiagnostics,5 and could lead to more powerful\ncombinations of the two technologies in the future. In addition, we\nhave shown that these reactions can be readily run without the need\nfor extraneous heating or visualization equipment. In particular,\nthe rapid mechanical disruption of infected leaf tissue into a reaction-ready\nlysate buffer eliminates the need for any nucleic acid isolation.\nWhile in these experiments the lysate was snap-frozen, they could\nequally be used for immediate analysis in the field. The ability of\nour methodology to selectively detect genomic sequences from CMV\nand PVY highlight the ability of the growing methodologies and\ndesign principles within RNA synthetic biology18 to contribute to real world applications. Further modifications\nto sample preparation will undoubtedly be needed to simplify the user\ninterface still further while improving the sensitivity of detection\nof lower replicating and genetically more diverse virus species. We\nhope that these developments can be incorporated within other synthetic\nbiology-based diagnostic platforms5 to\nenable PoUDs to be developed and delivered to regions of the world\nthat need them most.",
