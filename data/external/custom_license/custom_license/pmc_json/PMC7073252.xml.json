            "text": "Diet has traditionally been advocated before drugs to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Statins, the most commonly used drugs to prevent cardiovascular disease, were developed specifically to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Numerous studies have documented their effectiveness in both reducing serum cholesterol and also the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group, 1994; Downs et al, 1998; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002; Shepherd et al, 1995; Sacks et al, 2000; Herrington et al, 2002). Now interest in this class of drugs has been extended to their pleiotropic effects which include anti-inflammatory actions, typically focusing on the reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) as a marker of inflammation (Ridker et al, 2001). Inflammation is considered by many to play a key role in cardiovascular disease (Rifai & Ridker, 2002), and CRP has been proposed as an important biomarker of CHD risk (Ridker et al, 1998a, 1998b, 2002).",

Recently, we demonstrated in a parallel study involving 46 subjects that by using a combination of cholesterol-lowering foods, a marked reduction in serum cholesterol could be achieved (Jenkin et al, 2003). This diet also appeared to reduce CRP by 28% (Jenkin et al, 2003). Of the 46 original subjects, 34 subjects have now taken all three treatments; control, statin, and combination diets, in a randomized crossover design to allow the effects of a statin to be compared directly with the combination diet taken by the same subjects. The detailed lipid results are the subject of a separate publication (Jenkins et al, 2005). This report documents the direct comparison in the same subject of changes in CRP following control, statin, and portfolio treatments.",

Participants\u2019 baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. In all, 55 participants were recruited from hyperlipidemic patients attending the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor Modification Center, St Michael's Hospital and from newspaper advertisements. Four participants who were randomized did not start the study. Seven participants were withdrawn or withdrew during or following a control treatment, the respective figures for the statin and portfolio treatments were seven and three participants. Five participants could not begin their third phase of the study due to precautions undertaken to minimize exposure to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus (Figure 1). All participants had previously raised LDL-cholesterol levels (>4.1 mmol/l) (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001). No participant had a history of cardiovascular disease, untreated hypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mmHg), diabetes, renal or liver disease and none were taking medications known to influence serum lipids apart from three women who were on stable doses of thyroxine, one of whom was also taking stable estrogen replacement therapy. Of the 34 participants who completed all treatments, 16 participants had been placed on statins and had discontinued them at least 2 weeks prior to each treatment period. Five participants were taking antihypertensive medications at a constant dose prior to and during the study and seven participants took aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the study on a regular basis, 10 participants had colds and \u2018flu\u2019-like episodes immediately before or at the time of blood sampling, and five subjects suffered from hard or soft tissue injury (osteoarthritis, tendonitis) with occasional use of analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs.",

No significant differences in blood CRP were seen between weeks 2 and 4 values; week 4 values were therefore used throughout for all analyses as the end point value. The significance of the differences between treatments was assessed by least squares means with Tukey\u2013Kramer adjustment for multiple comparisons (SAS Institute, 1997). The ANOVA model used the absolute CRP reduction as well as percentage change from baseline as the response variable and treatment, sex, sex by treatment interaction and a random participant term nested within sex by sequence as main effects. The absolute CRP reductions were also assessed using the ANCOVA model with baseline as the covariate. To minimize the risk of including subjects who may have had transient elevations of CRP due to infections or injury, the primary analysis eliminated values above 3.5 mg/l since in a recent analysis of studies measuring CRP in men and women the 75th percentile for women was 3.48 mg/l and for men the value was 3.2 mg/l (Ockene et al, 2001; Rifai & Ridker, 2003). The distribution of responses was far from normal, and because such extreme departures from normality can bias the results of an F-test (Neter et al, 1985), data were transformed to obtain a more normal sample distribution. To achieve this, the two-parameter family of Box\u2013Cox transformations (Box and Cox, 1964) was used. We applied a grid search procedure to maximize the Shapiro\u2013Wilk statistics, the statistics applied most often to test the hypothesis of an underlying normal distribution. A special macro was written by using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) to estimate the parameter in Box\u2013Cox transformation. A secondary analysis was also carried out including all participants who had completed at least one or two of the three phases (three and nine participants, respectively) as part of an intention to treat analysis, increasing the total number of subjects from 34 on control, statin and portfolio to 41, 40, and 42, respectively. This analysis did not include subjects who had no post baseline value, but included two subjects whose week 2 value was carried forward to week 4. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess the significance of the change from pretreatment. The nonparametric sign test was used to assess whether the statin or portfolio diets were significantly different in reducing CRP for completers and with the intention to treat analysis of the total group including noncompleters. Spearman correlation was used to assess association between CRP and anthropometric data, due to the skewed nonnormal distribution of the CRP data (SAS Institute, 1997). The data were analyzed three times: first as the complete data, and subsequently, on the basis of these results, by two post hoc analyses. The aim of these post hoc analyses were to determine the effect of reducing the scatter seen with CRP that is often related to acute infection and other nondiet related events. For these analyses maximum levels of 10 mg/l, a commonly accepted upper level (Ockene et al, 2001) and 3.5 mg/l, the 75% from a large meta-analysis (Rifai & Ridker, 2003), were used as the upper levels of values for inclusion.",

The situation is therefore similar to homocysteine where strong associations have been demonstrated with cardiovascular disease (The Homocysteine Studies Collaboration, 2002), but the results of large randomized control trials are not yet available to provide more definitive evidence for a cause and effect relation. At present, there are strong associations between CRP and cardiovascular disease (Ridker et al, 1998a, 1998b, 2002) especially in women (Ridker et al, 2002), which appear to have a powerful predictive value similar to the LDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio (Ridker et al, 1998a). Furthermore, a large reduction in CHD risk by statins is seen in subjects with normal LDL-cholesterol levels but high CRP levels at baseline (Ridker et al, 2002). Increased body weight, central adiposity, and insulin resistance are associated with raised CRP levels (Ford, 1999, Yudkin et al, 1999; Lemieux et al, 2001). In the present study, BMI at baseline was one of the determinants of CRP. The link is presumably through adipose tissue-derived proinflammatory cytokines (eg IL-6) and their effect on hepatic acute phase proteins (Rattazzi et al, 2003).",

            "text": "However, one concern with CRP and its potential predictive value in CHD is how to control for physiological and noncardiovascular pathological variations in CRP. This variability is also a likely explanation for why not all statin trials have shown reduced CRP concentrations (Dangas et al, 1999; Cortellaro et al, 2000; Kalela et al, 2001). CRP concentrations are increased by infection (Tillet and Francis, 1930; Ledue & Rifai, 2003) and estrogens (Ridker et al, 1999; Pradhan et al, 2002), and influenced by lifestyle manipulations, including alcohol intake and regular exercise, which tend to depress CRP (Cushman et al, 1999; Albert et al, 2003), and smoking which may increase it (Albert et al, 2003; Frohlich et al, 2003). Although many of these factors are also associated with CHD risk and may therefore contribute to the overall usefulness of CRP, acute changes may reduce the predictive value of CRP seen in cohort studies (Danesh et al, 2004; Tall, 2004) and confound short-term intervention studies such as this one. In this respect, it may be noteworthy that the phases two and three of the present study were carried out during the winter months and on into Spring. Phase one, which was also the focus of a previous study, and which showed a clearer effect of the dietary portfolio in lowering CRP, was carried out largely in the late Summer and Fall. It may be that unreported respiratory infections, common in winter, may have resulted in increased variability in the CRP data as reflected in the current analysis. The present study was well complied with both in terms of percentage of tablets taken and dietary calories reported as consumed. In addition, a relatively uniform reduction in LDL-cholesterol was seen at 2 and 4 weeks on both the statin and portfolio treatments (Jenkins et al, 2003, 2005). The present study had the advantage that alcohol intake was limited in the prestudy period and was not allowed on the metabolic diets. Exercise was also held constant throughout the study period and only one subject smoked (<5 cigarettes daily) during the study period. Nevertheless, despite these precautions, when using unrestricted CRP data no treatment effect was observed. In order to obtain sufficient definition to establish the effects of statin and dietary portfolio on CRP it was necessary to eliminate values exceeding 3.5 mg/l. This value was selected because it was the 75th percentile in pooled analysis of the Physicians\u2019 Health Study (PHS), the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), and the Women's Health Study (WHS) (Ockene et al, 2001) and the 84th percentile in our group of both men and women. Currently the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control recommend CRP as part of the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk, where \u22641 mg/l is low risk, 1\u20133 mg/l is intermediate risk and >3 mg/l is high risk (Pearson et al, 2003). Our study therefore covers the intermediate risk range. Of those subjects with values greater than 3.5 mg/l, 41.4% had a reason, such as \u2018flu\u2019-like illnesses, infections or tissue injury for a raised CRP compared to 20.4% for those individuals with values less than 3.5 mg/l. The respective values from other studies where 10 mg/l was the upper level for CRP (Jenkins et al, 2002b) were 80% for subjects with values above 10 mg/l and 30% for those below (Ockene et al, 2001). These studies have been much more inclusive in defining infections that may have been associated with raised CRP levels. They have included infections that occurred up to 90 days prior to blood sampling (Pischon et al, 2003). Our data are likely to have underestimated the effect of infections. Increasing the range to as little as 2 weeks prior to blood sampling would have increased the percentage of raised CRP levels for which we could account to 48.2%.",

            "text": "Few previous studies have demonstrated an effect of diet on CRP. Recently \u03c9-3 vegetable oils and monounsaturated fats have been shown to reduce CRP as have low glycemic index diets (Pischon et al, 2003; Blok et al, 1997; Liu et al, 2002). Soy isoflavones appear to increase IL-6, although a significant increase in CRP has not been reported (Jenkins et al, 2002a). Almonds do not appear to influence CRP concentrations (Jenkins et al, 2002c). No data have been reported on fiber or plant sterols and CRP. An exact reason why the portfolio of dietary components we used appeared to reduce CRP levels cannot at present be provided. The carbohydrate foods on the dietary portfolio tended to have low glycemic indices including oat bran (Foster-Powell et al, 2002), barley (Foster-Powell et al, 2002) and viscous fibers such as psyllium, which also reduce postprandial glycemia (Jenkins et al, 1978). It has been suggested that reduced postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in turn result in less free radical generation and oxidative stress (Ceriello & Motz, 2004) and less cytokine release from adipose tissue including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The adipose tissue-derived cytokines then stimulate hepatic acute phase protein production and so lead to increased serum levels of CRP and serum amyloid A. Recent studies suggest a link between the consumption of low glycemic index diets and reduced plasma CRP correlations (Wolever et al, 2004).",
