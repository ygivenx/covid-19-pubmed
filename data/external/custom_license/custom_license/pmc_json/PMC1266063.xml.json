To generate high-quality draft, usually \u223c8\u00d7 coverage is optimal (1). Finished sequence, without gaps or ambiguous base calls, usually requires 8\u00d7 to 10\u00d7 coverage, along with additional analyses, often manual, to orient the contigs relative to one another and to close the gaps between them in a process called finishing. In fact, it has been stated that \u2018the defining distinction of draft sequencing is the avoidance of significant human intervention\u2019 (1), although there are computational tools that may also be capable of automated finishing in some circumstances (2).",

By a \u2018signature\u2019 we mean a short region of sequence that is sufficient to uniquely identify an organism down to the species level, without false negatives due to strain variation or false positives due to cross reaction with close phylogenetic relatives. In addition, for DNA signatures, we require that the signature be suitable for a TaqMan reaction (e.g. composed of two primers and a probe of the desired Tms). Limited funds and facilities in which to sequence biothreat pathogens mean that decision makers must choose wisely which and how many organisms to sequence. Money and time saved as a result of draft rather than finished sequencing enables more target organisms, more isolates of the target and more near neighbors (NNs) of the target to be sequenced. However, if draft data do not facilitate the generation of high-quality signatures for detection, the tradeoff of quantity over quality will not be worth it.",

Marburg and variola viruses were used as model organisms for these analyses, due to the availability of multiple genomes for these organisms. We hope that variola may serve as a guide for making predictions about bacteria, in which the genomes are substantially larger, and thus the cost of sequencing is much higher than for viruses. Variola was selected as the best available surrogate for bacteria at the time we began these analyses because:\nit is double-stranded DNA;it has a relatively low mutation rate, more like bacteria than like the RNA or shorter DNA viruses that have higher mutation rates and thus higher levels of variation;it is very long for a virus, albeit shorter than a bacterial genome;we have access to many genomes, which were sequenced by our collaborators at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA;there are finished genomes available, so we can compare actual finished data with simulated draft data.\nOnly recently have a fairly large number of Bacillus anthracis genomes become available to us.

First, target genomes are aligned using WGASA. A set of gene (start, end) pairs for both the plus and minus strands relative to the reference genome is required. This implies that coding frames for the translation of nucleic acid codons into amino acids for each protein of the target organism's genome have been correctly determined. From the aligned genomes, nucleotide codons are translated into amino acid sequence based on the gene locations, and conserved strings of six or more amino acids among all the target genomes are recorded. These conserved fragments are then compared with the NCBI GenBank non-redundant (nr) database of amino acid sequences, unveiling peptides that are unique to the target species. For our computations, we require that if a peptide signature is longer than six amino acids, then every sub-string of length six amino acids is also conserved and unique. There may be many conserved and unique peptide signatures on the same and on different proteins. The resulting conserved, unique peptides that are at least six amino acids long from open reading frames are considered to be protein signature candidates.",

Then the regions between the anchors are aligned using a tool, such as clustalw or HMMer. The algorithm functions most efficiently if anchors are frequent and dispersed across the genomes to provide even coverage. If substitutions, deletions, insertions or gaps in sequence information (e.g. between contigs) result in an anchor's absence in one or more of the genomes, then those regions must be aligned using clustalw, which is slower and more memory intensive for large amounts of sequence data.

A second pool was created of all available NN complete genomes, with the total count of sequences called N. Next, we selected 10 random samples of size t targets and n NNs, for all t ranging from 1 to T and all n ranging between 1 and minimum(10,N). We ran the DNA Signature Prediction Pipeline for each sample, with signature prediction based on conservation among the t target strains and uniqueness relative to a >1 Gb database minus those NNs in the NN pool that were not chosen in that sample. Thus, for each sample, signature candidates were predicted as though we had only t target and n NN sequences, as well as the rest of the less-closely related organisms in our database that are not considered NNs. In addition to the number of TaqMan signature candidates, the fraction of the genome that is conserved among the t target sequences was also calculated. Based on the combined results of the many signature pipeline runs using random target samples of size t and n, we assessed how much sequence data, that is, the values of t and n, was required to approximate the number of signature candidates c that were predicted when the full data set (all target and NN sequences, t = T and n = N) was analyzed with the signature pipeline. Using the full data set will yield the fewest signatures, because lack of conservation or uniqueness will winnow away all unsuitable candidates.",

For long, double-stranded DNA viruses (e.g. variola) and bacteria, the sequencing error rates are larger at the beginning and end of a contig than in the middle, and small contigs are more likely to contain sequencing errors than are large contigs. In contrast, due to differences in generating the products for Sanger sequencing that are employed for smaller RNA and DNA viruses, there are often more sequencing errors in the middle of contigs for such smaller viral draft genomes. Although we did not specifically simulate draft for RNA and short DNA viruses, our simulator should work with minor modification to a few parameters. Thus, there are four parameters that must be specified for simulating sequencing errors: (i) the size cutoff for small versus large contigs, (ii) the probability of errors in the middle portion of small versus large contigs, (iii) the length of the contig ends where sequencing is either less accurate (bacteria and long double-stranded DNA viruses) or more accurate (small viruses, RNA viruses) and (iv) the probability of sequencing errors at the contig ends. If there is a sequencing error at a particular base, we assumed that that base is randomly changed to one of the other three bases with equal probability.

In addition, the $0.40/bp figure for draft of 6\u00d7 to 8\u00d7 coverage could range from $0.30 to $0.50/bp using shotgun sequencing, but may be as low as $0.10\u2013$0.20/bp if primer walking works well (i.e. known primer sites are found in new isolates).

However, draft sequencing of this low quality (3\u00d7 to 6\u00d7) for Marburg causes a dramatic decline in the ability to computationally eliminate regions of poor conservation, and thus to exclude poor signature regions (Figure 2).

These results differ from those using finished genomes, where the lack of sequence conservation is more evident and there are zero TaqMan signatures conserved among all strains. Most combinations of four finished genomes are sufficient to eliminate non-conserved signatures (Figure 3A).

First, a conservation gestalt is generated from the sequence alignment, in which non-conserved bases are replaced by a dot (\u2018.\u2019). Then uniqueness is calculated based upon perfect matches of at least 18 bp long between the conservation gestalt and a large sequence database of non-target sequences. Non-conserved bases in the conservation gestalt may break up a region into conserved fragments of <18 bases long, and as a result these short fragments are not tested for uniqueness. Consequently, if there is a low level of conservation, then we may overestimate the fraction of the genome that is unique. For example, in Table 1 the conserved+unique fraction is 4% with finished variola target data, but is overestimated at 58% with low-quality draft. This artifact does not, however, affect TaqMan signature prediction, since the regions suitable for primers and probes must have at least 18 contiguous, conserved bases, and all of these are tested for uniqueness, i.e. there is no underestimation of uniqueness in conserved fragments that are at least 18 bp in length, and thus no underestimate of uniqueness in the predicted signatures.

With 16 genomes, the 75% quantile mark approaches the final predicted number of 97 signatures (Figure 8A). This pattern indicates that there is a set of 97 peptides that are highly conserved among all currently sequenced variolas, which are unlikely to be eroded even as more sequence data are obtained.

This occurs since sequencing errors occur at random, in different locations in each of the draft target genomes, and obscure the truly conserved peptides. One might falsely infer from peptide SAP results based on the draft data that additional sequencing (beyond the 28 variola major genomes used here) would be useful in generating peptide signature candidates.
