Various kinds of lung injuries due to infection, allogeneic transplantation, and exposure to toxic fumes have been reported to cause BO [1, 2]. It is known that these diverse medical conditions share some common pathways that result in a characteristic histopathology of BO, subepithelial inflammation, and fibrotic narrowing of bronchioles [2]. In young children, BO occurs most often after respiratory infection and common pathogens including adenovirus, influenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been associated with the development of post-infectious BO (PIBO) [3]. Many children diagnosed with PIBO, in contrast to those with post-transplant BO, show clinical improvement during lung development. However, radiological findings and impaired lung function are persistent or sometimes progressive [4\u20136].",

In our study, serum levels of VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 were significantly higher in the PIBO group than those in the controls. These results suggest that those growth factors might also be involved in the pathogenesis of PIBO in young children.

Those growth factors are known to be involved in remodeling of asthmatic airways. Although thickening of reticular basement membrane and subepithelial fibrosis are components of airway remodeling in asthma, similar changes are observed in BO [31]. A previous study reported that the structural changes were observed only in atopic but not in non-atopic subjects with asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness [32]. A recent study also showed that atopy was associated with increased airway smooth muscle area in preschool children with severe recurrent wheeze [33]. Although there was no significant difference in clinical findings, taken together with these previous results, our study seems to suggest that the molecular pathogenesis might be different between atopic and non-atopic children with PIBO. We think a future long-term follow-up study is needed to determine the outcome of PIBO in relation to atopic status of the children.",

However, to our knowledge, our study showed for the first time that YKL-40, known to play a role in the development of BO after lung transplantation or other lung injuries, is also increased in the serum of the children who developed BO after respiratory infection.",
