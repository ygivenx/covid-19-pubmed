Purified supernatant of these cell cultures was subjected to negative-staining electron microscopy, which showed numerous adenovirus-like particles (Figure 1, panel A). The family Adenoviridae was verified by the first reaction of a generic adenovirus-specific nested PCR (10). The obtained sequence of a fragment of the DNA polymerase gene (\u2248550 bp) indicated that the viruses were a novel virus type within the genus Mastadenovirus and was tentatively named bat adenovirus 2 (bat AdV-2) strain P. pipistrellus virus 1 (PPV1).",

The partial sequence of the bat AdV-2 DNA polymerase (3,408 bp; GenBank accession no.

After repeated sequence analysis of the partial DNA polymerase gene for validation, we found that the identities of bat AdV-2 PPV1 to closely related adenoviruses ranged from 68% to 74% on nucleic acid level (Table 1), with the closest relationship found to canine adenoviruses 1 and 2. So far, the only other adenovirus in bats has been accidentally isolated from primary bat kidney cells of a healthy Ryukyu flying fox (Pteropus dasymallus yayeyamae) (12), which proved to have a rather distant phylogenetic relationship to bat AdV-2 (Figure 2).",

(12), who postulated the necessity of primary bat cells to isolate DNA virus from chiroptera, our isolation of a DNA virus from an European bat in a permanent cell line (monkey kidney cells) proved the opposite. We believe that the rare detection and isolation of viruses might be attributed to the fast natural degradation of bats of the suborder Microchiroptera in comparison to that of other animal carcasses, most likely due to their extremely low weight (2\u201310 g). Although viruses were not detected by various generic PCR assays from homogenized frozen tissue samples, we isolated a novel virus from a hibernating insectivorous bat species. This virus was detected in high DNA copy numbers in the intestine of 3 bats that died of natural causes.",

Here, in all 3 infected bats, the highest copy number of adenovirus DNA was detected in the intestine, which suggests a correlation with a gastrointestinal disease. The host range of mastadenoviruses is known to be limited to a single (or a few closely related) mammalian species (13) with a probable co-evolution between virus and their hosts (14). The acquired partial sequence of the bat AdV-2 DNA polymerase with the closest relation to canine adenovirus (only 74% at the nucleic acid level) and the isolation from a new animal host suggests that this virus is a new adenovirus species within the genus Mastadenovirus. A comparison to the only other adenovirus found in a bat (flying fox, order Megachiroptera) with the available sequence information of a \u2248550-bp fragment of the DNA polymerase gene showed their distant relationship. This strict separation reflects either the co-evolutionary development between the 2 adenoviruses (bat AdV-1 FBV1, bat AdV-2 PPV1) and their host families Pteropodidae and Vespertilionidae or a host switch of the virus originating from a yet-undetermined vertebrate host. To elucidate this problem, further research will be necessary.",
