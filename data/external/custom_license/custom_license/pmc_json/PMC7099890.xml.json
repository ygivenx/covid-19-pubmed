Data on the incidence of influenza-like illness in the community of Ljubljana region were obtained from the Slovenian Sentinel Network.

Nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma specimens were collected from all participants at each of the 16 predetermined study time-points for the detection of selected respiratory viruses. Basic demographic information was also collected from all study participants at enrollment. At enrollment, and at each of the follow-up time-points, information on the presence of any acute respiratory symptoms was obtained, as well as information about sick contacts at home. Symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, hoarseness, sore throat, or cough were considered indicative of upper respiratory tract infection. Visitors were advised not to come to visit if they had acute respiratory symptoms and to wear a surgical mask if they decided to come anyway.",

Tubes with swabs were vigorously vortexed for 30 s, and 200-\u03bcl samples were used for extraction. Nucleic acids were eluted in 100 \u03bcl of elution buffer. Plasma was separated from the cell fraction of the blood and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for eventual further processing. All respiratory samples were tested by single real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for each virus by using TaqMan or MGB probes as described previously [8\u201314]. The following respiratory viruses were tested: influenza (INFV) A and B, parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) strain A and B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (RV), human bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus, and coronavirus (CoV), including the HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E subtypes. For all patients with at least one nasopharyngeal swab sample testing positive for viral particles, we performed PCR analysis for the detection of the corresponding viruses in plasma specimens, which were obtained concomitantly with the first positive respiratory sample.",

The exact proportion of asymptomatic patients was impossible to determine accurately. Because of the poor general health condition of the ICU patients, we only assessed lower respiratory tract infection in the patient cohort, which might has resulted in an overestimation of the proportion of asymptomatic infections.

The vaccination rate among employees was comparable to that against the 2009 pandemic INFV A virus among healthcare workers reported by Poeppl et al. [19]. Although INFV was not detected among our ICU personnel, vaccinated employees were less likely to be symptomatic than unvaccinated ones.

Among our employees, a higher proportion (24/41; 58.5%) of participants developed acute respiratory tract infection during a much shorter time period (8 weeks), but the ratio of virus-positive symptomatic episodes was substantially smaller (8/59, 13.6%). A partial explanation for the latter distinction might be that in our study the timing of swab collection was predetermined and not always concomitant with the beginning of respiratory symptoms, when viral load is supposedly at its peak [21]. As only selected viruses known to cause respiratory symptoms were tested in our study, acute respiratory symptoms in virus-negative employees may have been caused by other viruses or micro-organisms.",

These results are in accordance with previous reports that virus detection does not necessarily mean viral disease [22]. Even if we considered recent or near future symptoms as being related to positive swab results, the proportion of symptomatic employees (9/17 = 52.9%) or swabs (11/30 = 36.7%) was lower than that reported by Nokso-Koivisto et al. who found that in most cases (87%) rhino- and enteroviral RNA detection in the nasopharynx of children could be linked to concurrent, past, or near future respiratory symptoms [23]. Similarly, Falsey et al. found that only 11% of RSV A and 9% of INFV A infections were asymptomatic in healthy elderly and high-risk adults [3]. We suggest that the higher proportion of asymptomatic infections in our employee cohort may be due to the fact that in the cited studies different populations of patients were evaluated, while our employee cohort comprised healthy adults, among whom only 3/41 (7.3%) were on sick leave during the study period because of acute respiratory symptoms and none was hospitalized. Another possible explanation for the higher asymptomatic rate among our employee cohort could be immunity due to frequent healthcare-related exposure to respiratory viruses. A higher immunity resulting from previous infections or vaccinations may also be an explanation for the finding that older employees in our study cohort were less often virus-positive. When only virus-positive employees were considered, we found that employees with acute respiratory symptoms had a higher viral load than asymptomatic employees; however, we did not perform a formal statistical analysis of this association due to the small number of virus-positive swabs.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study which has simultaneously evaluated the frequency of multiple respiratory viruses in patients and employees in an ICU setting. Despite the implementation of strict hygiene precautions in our ICU we had expected the spread of respiratory viruses within ICU to be the major outcome of our study. However, our results indicate only a limited possibility of virus transmission between the two groups, which is quite the opposite to their greater risk for nosocomial transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [24]. Our comparison of findings in patients and employees revealed that the distribution of the tested viruses differed noticably between the two groups (Fig. 1; Table 2). INFV A was present in one-fifth of patients, but there was not a single case of this infection among employees, despite the fact that less than half of the employees had been vaccinated against it. In contrast to INFV A, RSV A was predominantly isolated from employees, while CoV was evenly distributed in both the patient and employee cohorts. We can conclude with certainty that, during the study period, INFV A (zero INFV A cases among employees) and RSV A (21 days between RSV A case in patients and first RSV A case in employees) were not transmitted from patients to employees or vice versa. We can only speculate on the transmission of CoV. The detection of the first CoV case in patients and subsequently in employees suggests transmission from patients to employees. When the estimated median incubation period of human CoV, i.e., 3.2 days [25], and the absence of sick household contacts in the first two CoV cases among employees are taken into account, this mode of transmission seems even more likely. However, a strong association between the presence of sick contacts at home and being virus-positive indicates that in employees, the risk of community infection was higher than the risk of work-related infection. In patients, the probability of testing positive decreased with the length of the ICU stay, which again points to a greater importance of the community over the hospital environment for acquisition of viral respiratory infections. In addition, in both patients and employees, the estimated effect of calendar time on the probability of virus positivity was very consistent with data on the frequency of influenza-like illness in the general population. Although this association was not statistically significant in the patient group, presumably due to the limited sample size in our study, it further supports the concept of the predominant influence of community over the nosocomial environment for respiratory viral infections.",
