Other clinical manifestations may include lingual ulcers [23], chronic gingivitis, pharyngitis [31], chronic stomatitis [30], pneumonia [30], acute arthritis [6, 21], jaundice with virulent systemic FCV disease and multi-organ failure [1, 15, 22, 27], and death from in utero infection [7]. However, existence of an asymptomatic carrier state is not uncommon, with up to 20\u201325% of apparently healthy cats shedding the virus [32, 33]. In addition to its isolation in domestic cats, FCV has been isolated from exotic felids, including captive cheetahs [25]. Antibodies specific for FCV have also been detected in free-ranging species including Namibian cheetahs [17], free-ranging African lions and mountain lions [14, 20], and Florida panthers [24].",

            "text": "A member of the genus Vesivirus, family Caliciviridae, FCV is a non-enveloped virus with a 7.7-kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome [5]. Nucleotides 1\u201319 of the genome are untranslated, followed by three open reading frames (ORF): ORF1 (nucleotides 20\u20135,305) encodes a large polyprotein that includes the viral polymerase; ORF2 (nucleotides 5,314 to 7,317\u20137,326) encodes the major structural capsid protein VP1; and ORF3 (nucleotides 7,617\u20137,626 to 7,634\u20137,643) encodes the minor structural protein VP2, with an unknown function [3, 4, 10, 13, 19, 28]. The FCV genome has relatively high genetic variability; however, genetic analysis of a variety of isolates from a previous investigation has shown that the first 52 nucleotides in all known sequences are 100% conserved. Nucleotides 101\u2013120 of the genome were also found to be highly conserved among FCV isolates [1, 10]. Virus isolation and conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the most common methods used for FCV diagnosis [9, 29]. Real-time RT-PCR has been developed for FCV; however, previous attempts to develop real-time RT-PCR for FCV have used SYBR green instead of a specific hybridization probe [12, 26, 34]. One study employed a sequence-specific probe targeting a 67-bp product from ORF1 (nucleotides 2,466\u20132,532 from accession number M86379), but the sequence of the targeted probe was variable among the FCV isolates [11].",

Most previous reports of real-time PCR for detection of FCV were limited to the use of SYBR green dye; however, using a specific molecular probe increases the specificity of the assay and provides opportunities for developing multiplex PCR for other feline respiratory tract pathogens [12, 26, 34]. Another assay utilized the hybridization probe, but the sequence of the targeted probe was variable among the FCV isolates [11].
