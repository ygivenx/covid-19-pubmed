Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have caused pandemics in humans, and subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 circulate in humans as seasonal influenza. Pandemic influenza arises when an animal influenza virus evolves through the reassortment of animal and human virus gene segments (antigenic shift) to sustainably transmit in humans. Avian and swine influenza viruses have caused zoonotic infections, some resulting in fatal disease. Thus, influenza virus surveillance in animals is needed for pandemic preparedness (1).",

The dromedary influenza A virus isolated in Nigeria in January 2016 was similar to other influenza viruses circulating in humans at the same time. The sampling dates for the influenza viruses detected in camels in Nigeria overlapped with the human influenza virus season, which typically occurs during October\u2013March (Appendix Table) (7). This finding suggests reverse zoonosis of influenza viruses from humans to dromedaries. Whether these viruses were subsequently maintained in dromedary populations via camel-to-camel transmission is not clear. Further studies are needed to address this question. Transmission of influenza A virus also occurs from humans to swine, and these viruses can be maintained in swine populations for variable periods, sometimes decades (8).",

The dromedaries that had influenza A virus RNA\u2013positive nasal swabs were negative for HI antibody. Dromedaries recently infected with a virus are expected to be seronegative for that virus because antibody responses against viruses take around a week to develop (9), by which time nasal swab specimens are often negative for that virus\u2019s genomic material. Microneutralization tests are more appropriate for testing antibody to contemporary H3N2 viruses (10); hence, we also tested serum samples for antibody to A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus using the microneutralization test (Appendix).
