During an artistic career that spanned 7 decades, he signed his works with more than 30 different names\u2014typically in tandem with a shift in his artistic style and technique. Though this practice was common in Japan during his lifetime, Hokusai changed his name more often than any other major Japanese artist.",

Hokusai is one of the outstanding figures and innovators of the Ukiyo-e or \u201cpictures of the floating world\u201d (that is, scenes of everyday life) school of printmaking. He is credited with expanding the range of subjects from traditional Ukiyo-e depictions of courtesans and kabuki actors to encompass landscapes and to include people from various social levels.",

            "text": "Though the exact date of its publication is unknown, Hokusai\u2019s defining work, \u201cThirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji,\u201d was created from 1826 through 1833. Mt. Fuji, which is tied firmly into the cultural, spiritual, and social identity of Japan, had long served as inspiration for Hokusai and his art. In response to brisk sales of the initial set of 36, the artist expanded this popular collection to comprise 46 woodblock prints. Art scholar Sarah Thompson notes that the universal appeal of Hokusai\u2019s works relates to his use of Western style perspectives and to \u201ctheir strong internal structure. Many prints in the Fuji series explicitly contrast the strikingly triangular shape of the mountain with triangles, rectangles, trapezoids, or curved shapes formed by other elements of the design.\u201d",

Some stoop and clutch their hats and clothes as others fruitlessly reach toward their papers and hats blowing skyward, mixing with the leaves stripped from the bending trees. The British Museum offers this description: \u201cThe silhouette of Mt. Fuji is drawn with a single line, providing a backdrop for the figures and trees battling the wind in the foreground. Bending their bodies and clutching at scarves and hats, all turn their faces away from us\u2014as if we were the source of the blast that carries off the tissues that had been tucked into the woman\u2019s kimono.\u201d",
