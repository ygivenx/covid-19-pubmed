Chinese authorities made a preliminary determination that the causative agent is a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and other respiratory pathogens have been ruled out as the cause (WHO). A consortium of researchers, government agencies and institutes released six sequences of the coronavirus associated with the outbreak in Wuhan on virological.org and on Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the new virus clusters with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus clade, and the virus has since been isolated.",

In addition, the virus has spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the United States, and additional cases in other countries are likely.",

SARS first emerged in the Guangdong province, China, causing the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. The virus spread rapidly among humans, affecting ~8,000 individuals in more than 30 countries and causing the death of ~800 patients. SARS and MERS coronaviruses likely originated in bats and have been transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels.",

The market has since been closed for environmental sanitation and disinfection, and environmental specimens from that and other markets are being collected and tested. The UN health agency has urged China to continue the efforts to identify the source, reservoirs and possible intermediate hosts of the new virus. The Wuhan Health Commission reported that \u201cthe possibility of limited human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out\u201d and infections of the health-care workers as well as infections of family members suggest that person-to-person spread is occurring (Nature).",
