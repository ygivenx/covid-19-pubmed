Two gap-free nucleotide alignments (817 bp and 1,221 bp) were generated. Tree topologies were determined on both datasets by using MrBayes version 3.1 (20). The analysis used a general time reversible (GTR) substitution model with 6 rate categories to approximate a gamma-shaped rate distribution across sites and an invariant site assumption (GTR + \u03936 + I). Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains of 107 iterations were sampled every 500 generations, resulting in 20,000 sampled trees. Two Metropolis-coupled chains (1 cold and 3 heated chains each) were run in parallel, compared, and pooled. Convergence of chains was confirmed by the potential scale reduction factor statistic in MrBayes (21) and by visual inspection of each cold chain using the TRACER program (22). Phylogenetic dating was conducted by using Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees (BEAST) (22). Chain lengths in BEAST were at least 20,000,000 generations with sampling every 500 generations. Convergence of the model was checked visually and by the effective sample size statistic with TRACER.",

Because 2 morphotypes were present (Figure 2), the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was sequenced as described (23). Both morphotypes belonged to phylogenetic lineages distinct from H. caffer and possibly represented 2 distinct species (P. Vallo, personal ongoing investigation). Both are collectively referred to as H. caffer (cf.) ruber in this study. A fraction of 15.4% of H. cf. ruber specimens yielded CoV, without a difference between sexes (14%/19%, n = 57/21 [M/F], respectively).

Phylogeny was inferred using a GTR + \u03934 + I model. The resulting MRCA date of the CoV2b (SARS-like)/GhanaBt-CoVGrp2 clade was 260 ad and that of the hCoV-NL63/-229E pair was 981 ad (see Table 2 for details). To include the novel GhanaBat-CoVGrp1, we repeated the same analysis by using the 817-bp dataset. The resulting MRCA date of the hCoV-NL63/229E pair was 816 ad in this analysis, which was in good concordance with results from the 1,221-bp dataset (Table 2) and also with previously published data (26). The diversification estimate for the novel group 1 bat-CoV and hCoV-229E then was 1803 ad.",

A Bayes factor test conducted in TRACER yielded a strong estimate of superiority of the codon-based model over the GTR + \u03934 + I model (log10 Bayes factor 139 [20 is highly significant]). To further optimize the prediction of MRCA dates, the constant population size assumption used in all analyses was exchanged against expansion growth or exponential growth assumptions. Both assumptions were predicted to fit the data better than the constant size model (Bayes factors 13.5 and 13.9). There was no difference between the expansion and exponential models (Bayes factor 0.34 in favor of expansion). The MRCA date of hCoV-229E and the GhanaBt-CoVGrp1 was 1686 (expansion) or 1800 (exponential growth). Table 2 summarizes the results.

Together with recent data from Germany, North America, Trinidad, and Kenya (11,12,28), these findings suggest that the association of CoV with bats is a worldwide phenomenon. The prevalence of CoV in insect-eating bats (9.76%) matched our previous findings in Germany. However, in that study we sampled during the breeding season and showed that CoVs are most likely amplified in maternity roosts (11). The composition of the catch in this study (no lactating females, no young bats) suggests sampling outside the breeding season and may not be directly comparable.

Several groups have shown that CoVs are almost exclusively detected in bat feces and not, as hypothesized earlier, in saliva (3,4,28,29). Surprisingly, little virus was found in all fecal samples tested in our study. We estimated the RNA concentration per full sample (100 mg feces = 2\u20134 fecal pellets) to be only up to 4.5 \u00d7 104 RNA copies. Human pathogenic viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route generate much higher virus concentrations in stool, up to \u22481012 RNA copies/mg, e.g., for different picornaviruses (30\u201332). Based on these data it would be difficult to postulate that humans can acquire CoV from bat feces. However, studies in other locations and at different times are needed to address virus concentration in bat droppings in more detail. Because virus in this study was only observed in insectivorous bats and not in frugivorous bats, future studies should investigate whether insects might constitute a source of CoV infection for bats.",

Although it has been suggested that RNAlater solution may preserve virus infectivity (33,34), our observations showed that the solution has to be diluted at least 1:20 in cell culture medium to avoid cytotoxicity (data not shown). Because of the low virus RNA concentrations observed, we did not attempt to isolate the virus. However, the absence of successful virus isolation from bat feces in previous studies (3\u20136,8,11,12) may not reflect the incapability of bat CoV to infect human cells.

            "text": "Reconstruction of phylogenetic and temporal relationships between bat CoV and other mammalian CoV is another way to obtain information on their zoonotic potential. Unfortunately, for CoV long sequence fragments must be analyzed before valid phylogenies can be inferred from the conserved nonstructural genome portion (28,36). Because of the low concentration of RNA in bat samples, generation of long sequences from novel bat CoV is tedious and technically demanding, which may be why some published phylogenies of bat CoV are based on short datasets, making it difficult to use these data for reference. For molecular clock dating, we have therefore relied on reference viruses mainly from other mammals that covered our 1,221-bp fragment in the conserved RdRp region. We assumed that the RdRp would be under less selective pressure than the structural genes and other nonstructural genes, and therefore could be used to infer nucleotide substitution rates over distantly related CoVs (7,25,26,36\u201338). We have confirmed all tree topologies using alternative methods of phylogenetic inference, including an MCMC algorithm implemented in MrBayes that eliminates artifacts contributed by fixation of MCMC chains in suboptimal prosterior probability maxima (20). Calibration was conducted on reliable isolation dates of prototype and novel bat CoV from the literature, as well as on the MRCA of the hCoV-OC43/Bovine CoV clade. For dating of only this specific CoV clade, a wide range of dated virus isolates has been available that covered as much as 34% (1965\u20132004) of the projected time of virus evolution from root to tip (1890\u20132004) (25). A probabilistic calibration prior was used, which is favorable for dating in combination with relaxed molecular clock assumptions (39). The determined mean substitution rates were in good concordance with earlier studies on non-bat\u2013CoV that used maximum likelihood-based methods in addition to Bayesian inference (25,26,38,40).",

Because Pyrc et al. generated these data by 3 alternative approaches (Bayesian, serial unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, maximum likelihood [26]), we used their MRCA to validate our results, and consequently prefer the MRCA dating from the exponential growth population model (as presented in Figure 3 in plain type). One earlier study on bat and non-bat CoV suggested a much faster evolutionary rate for CoV than other studies (7). As Vijaykrishna et al. pointed out, their results were associated with large confidence intervals caused by the lack of available data on Bt CoV at the time the study was conducted (7). The increase of available sequence data now enables a better account of CoV evolutionary history.",

The genus Rhinolophus from the sister family Rhinolophidae was found to host SARS-like viruses in several studies in China. One of our Hipposideros CoVs was in a basal phylogenetic relationship with the SARS-like clade (group 2b); their most recent common ancestors date back to \u2248400 bc. Tong et al. (17) have detected a sequence fragment of a bat CoV in Kenya that also belongs to the 2b clade but is associated with the genus Chaerephon, a free-tailed bat that is rather distantly related to the genus Hipposideros. Although these authors analyzed only a short sequence fragment, their 2b CoV seems to be related more closely to SARS CoV than the virus found in our study. In the many studies conducted in China, only closely related members of the 2b group were detected, with the most basal members dating back only to the 17th century, according to our analysis. The co-occurrence of basal and closely related viruses in Africa, as well as the existence of the same virus clade in bats other than those of the family Hipposideridae, may entail speculations about a possible origin of the SARS-like group of CoVs in Africa rather than in Asia.",

Further to the proven recent host switching of SARS CoV, Vijgen et al. have suggested that hCoV-OC43 entered the human population \u2248120 years ago, causing a pandemic (25). This virus was most likely acquired by humans from domestic cattle. Results of our study show that it is not unlikely that hCoV-229E, which today is circulating worldwide in humans, resulted from a host switching event not more than 208\u2013322 years ago. However, as with molecular clock dating of viruses, associated confidence limits should not be overlooked.",

Despite the statistical limitations of our rather small sample size, the absence of CoV in bats of the closely related species H. abae that were tested in our study in two different caves speaks in favour of tight host restriction. Another supportive argument is the absence of CoV in C. afra, a bat species sampled in sufficient numbers at the Booyem cave. This cave was coinhabited by CoV-positive H. cf. ruber bats. If tight host restriction to nonmigratory H. cf. ruber bats existed, this would indicate an origin of hCoV-229E within the geographic range of its host, i.e., the rainforest belt and the wet forested savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa (23). Unfortunately, it will be difficult to reconstruct whether the projected host transition event might have been associated with human epidemic disease.",
