Information collected by this surveillance system constitutes the primary phenotypic information used in this study and includes underlying health status and chronic medical conditions, influenza vaccination status, clinical course and features, and results of microbiologic and virologic testing. Reporting to this surveillance system does not require submission of tissue samples; however, CDC routinely receives tissue samples for a subset of fatal pediatric influenza cases for diagnostic confirmation.

Extraction of the supernatant was completed with an EZ1 DNA Tissue Kit or a MagAttract DNA Mini M48 Kit (QIAGEN), with DNA eluted into a final 100-\u00b5L volume. DNA quality was assessed with a human RNase P real-time PCR in 25-\u03bcL volumes by using Agilent Brilliant II QPCR Master Mix as described (4). Validated TaqMan assays were used to genotype each SNP (protocols, primers, and probes available at http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov). Each 25-\u03bcL real-time PCR consisted of 12.5 \u03bcL of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 900 nmol of assay-specific primer, 200 nmol of assay-specific probe, and 5 \u03bcL of DNA. All controls (extraction blanks, no template controls, and positive controls for each genotype used at 5 ng per PCR; Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ, USA) and unknown samples were assayed in duplicate. Thermal cycling conditions consisted of 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 50 cycles of 92\u00b0C for 30 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min.

For MBL2, we examined 5 SNPS, 3 in the coding region of exon 1 and 2 in the promoter region. The 3 structural SNPs in MBL2 that we examined encode variant alleles known as D (codon 52, rs5030737), B (codon 54, rs1800450), and C (codon 57, rs1800451); the wild-type is A (7,8). These variants are typically pooled and designated as the O allele. The MBL2 genotype A/A refers to wild-type homozygotes, A/O refers to heterozygotes, and O/O refers to homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Promoter polymorphisms at positions \u2212550 (H/L variant, rs11003125) and \u2212221 (X/Y variant, rs7096206) encode variants that mediate MBL2 expression. Case-patients were classified as low, intermediate, or high producers of MBL on the basis of their structural and promoter variants (referred to as a \u201ctruncated haplotype\u201d) (7). Case-patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for any of the 3 variant structural alleles and case-patients with a variant structural allele on 1 chromosome and the X variant on the other were categorized as low MBL producers. Case-patients homozygous for the wild-type structural allele were categorized as high MBL producers except for those also homozygous for the X variant, who were classified as intermediate MBL producers on the basis of evidence that possession of the X/X promoter genotype significantly down-regulates MBL production (9). Case-patients with the YA/O genotype were classified as intermediate MBL producers on the basis of analyses indicating that this genotype confers intermediate levels of functional MBL (9). For some analyses, the intermediate and high producers were combined into 1 group and compared with MBL low-producers.",

In a subgroup analysis, the minor allele frequency of rs5030737 was significantly less common among case-patients <5 years old than in the reference sample (2% vs. 7.2%; p = 0.02). Among low producers of MBL, we observed an estimated odds ratio of 7.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6\u201332.1) for invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) co-infection compared with case-patients with high or intermediate MBL production, according to MBL2 genotype (p = 0.02 by Fisher exact test; Table 3). Low-producing MBL2 genotypes were also associated with an approximate 3-fold increased risk for bacterial co-infection in general and with S. aureus infection overall, but these associations did not reach statistical significance. Characteristics of case-patients with invasive MRSA co-infection are shown in Table 4.",

One possibility is that MRSA is a marker for other strain characteristics. For example, such an association could arise if MRSA infections were predominantly the USA300 strain while other S. aureus infections were predominantly the USA100 strain. Unfortunately, we do not have data on S. aureus genetic strain types. We also found that of the 4 fatal influenza cases in which patients had both MRSA co-infection and low-producing MBL genotypes, 2 patients reportedly also had asthma. It is well-established that asthma increases the risk for serious complications of influenza, and although we know of no evidence suggesting that low-producing MBL genotypes are associated with increased risk for asthma (40), this finding may be worth further exploration in future studies.",

An obvious next step is examination of all functional variants of the MBL2 gene in conjunction with gene expression and functional assays in a larger group of severely ill influenza case-patients with sufficiently detailed clinical data to define important phenotypes (e.g., MRSA co-infection). Interest in association studies of rare variants, the availability of new sequencing technologies that dramatically decrease the cost of sequencing, and access to reference human sequence data suggest that investigating rare variants in candidate genes (including MBL2 and TNF) and their functional effects may be a promising avenue of research. Large-scale genotyping of a sample of case-patients to look for common variants by using methods such as genomewide association studies may be possible if a network of collaborators capable of pooling a sufficient number of case-patients is developed. Recent initiatives such as the Genome-based Research and Population Health International Network (www.graphint.org/ver2) are aimed at encouraging such networks. Given the rapid acceleration in laboratory technologies, enhancement in bioinformatics methods and capacity, and trends toward collaborative research within large consortia, exploration of the role of host genomic factors in serious illness associated with influenza and other viral pathogens is increasingly feasible. We believe that host genomics is a promising area for future research regarding who is at risk for severe complications of acute infectious diseases, including influenza.",
