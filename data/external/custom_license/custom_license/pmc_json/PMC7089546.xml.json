            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new infectious disease typically associated with fever, shortness of breath, cough, and pneumonia, first emerged in southern China in November 2002. Within months of the outbreak, SARS had spread globally, affecting over 8,000 patients in 29 countries with 774 fatalities [1]. The etiology of SARS is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2\u20134]. SARS-CoV infects many organs, including lungs, liver, and immune cells [5, 6]. Subsequent studies have indicated that the SARS-CoV is of animal origin [7], and its precursor is still present in animal populations within the region. Although the global outbreak of SARS has been contained, there are serious concerns over its re-emergence. To date, no specific treatment exists for this disease. Thus, further basic and clinical research is required to control the disease.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is phylogenetically distinct, and only distantly related to the other coronavirus clades [8, 9]. Coronaviruses are exceptionally large RNA viruses and employ complex regulatory mechanisms to express their genomes [10]. The genome structure, gene expression pattern and protein profiles of SARS-CoV are similar to those of other coronaviruses. Nine SARS-CoV specific mRNAs were synthesized in virus-infected cells [11]. These RNA were predicted to encode 4 structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins), 16 non-structural proteins, and 8 accessory proteins. Previous studies on various coronaviruses indicated that the four structural proteins (S, E, M, and NC) play roles in virion morphogenesis [12, 13]. NC binds to viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid. Co-expression of M and E proteins together can form virus-like particles [14, 15]. Interactions between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsids result in virus budding through the cellular membrane [16]. Through the interaction with M protein, S protein is incorporated into the viral envelope [17, 18] and the mature virions are released from the cells. These studies suggest that coronavirus M protein [19, 20] plays a crucial role in the assembly of virus particles. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV assembles at and buds into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment [21]. Accumulation of the viral envelope proteins at this compartment is a prerequisite for virus assembly [22]. Immuno-EM (electron microscopy) revealed that budding occurred at membranes of the ERGIC and the Golgi region as early as 3 h post infection, demonstrating that SARS-CoV replicated surprisingly fast. Previous data also suggests that SARS-CoV established replication complexes at ER-derived membranes [21]. Later on, viral nucleocapsids were transported to the budding sites in the Golgi region where the viral glycoproteins accumulate and particle formation occurs. Assembly of SARS-CoV RNA packaging signal into virus-like particles is nucleocapsid dependent [23]. In this report, the protein-protein interactions among SARS-CoV structural proteins were studied using confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting analysis. Results from this study indicate that, similar to the M protein of other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV M protein plays a crucial role in the interactions between SARS-CoV structural proteins.",

Fixed cells were washed with incubation buffer (0.05% NaN3, 0.02% saponin, 1% skim milk in PBS) twice for 5 min each time, then incubated with primary antibody (e.g., mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody, Invitrogen), which was diluted 200 fold, at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Samples were washed with PBS three times (5 min each time at room temperature), then incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (e.g., goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, diluted 20\u00d7) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Samples were again washed with PBS three times (5\u201310 min each time at room temperature). DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Merck, Germany) was used to stain DNA to localize the cell nuclei. Samples were then observed with confocal microscopy. To quantify the average percentage of co-localization, the Image J (NIH website) program was used [25].",

As shown in Fig. 4a, the V5-tagged M protein without the first 100 amino acids was immunoprecipitated by the anti-myc antibody in the presence (lane 8), but not in the absence (lane 6) of NC protein, while the first 100 amino acids of M protein with V5 tag could not be immunoprecipitated by the anti-myc antibody in the presence of the NC protein (Fig. 4b). This result indicates that the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of SARS-CoV M protein was responsible for the binding with NC protein. To determine whether different topologies of the C-terminus domain of M protein could still interact with NC protein, the first (amino acids 21\u201337) or the second (amino acids 46\u201368) transmembrane domain of M protein was deleted. M protein without the first transmembrane domain still left its C-terminus domain in the cytoplasm and it was not glycosylated, while M protein without the second transmembrane domain left its C-terminus domain in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (Supplementary Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 4c, M protein without the first transmembrane domain interacted with NC protein while M protein without the second transmembrane domain did not. To identify the regions within the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of M protein responsible for binding to NC protein, different regions (amino acids 101\u2013135, 136\u2013170, and 171\u2013221) within the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of M protein were deleted separately.

The first 50 amino acids of this truncated M protein were further deleted and still interacted with E protein. M protein without this region (amino acids 51\u2013170) still interacted with E protein. These results suggest that multiple regions within M protein interacted with E protein. The second and third transmembrane regions (amino acids 46\u201368 and 78\u2013100) of M protein by themselves, penetrated into the cell membrane, while the first transmembrane region (amino acids 14\u201336) was stabilized by interaction with the other transmembrane segments [25]. To determine whether the second or third transmembrane region alone interacted with E protein, these two transmembrane regions were fused with the first 115 amino acids of HCV core protein separately [25]. As shown in Fig. 5b, the second or the third transmembrane region of M protein alone was sufficient to bind E protein. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of M protein (i.e. M protein without its first 100 amino acids) also interacted with E protein (Fig. 5c). In this case, the unglycosylated, but not glycosylated, E protein was preferentially immunoprecipitated.
