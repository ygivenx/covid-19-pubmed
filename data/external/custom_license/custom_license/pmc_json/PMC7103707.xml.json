While regular infusions with IG prevent the vast majority of serious bacterial infections within this population, there is no single prophylactic regimen that provides protection against the wide range of viral pathogens to which these patients are susceptible [2\u20138]. In the USA, there are several commercially available IG products that meet minimum standards of concentrations of antibodies to diphtheria toxoid (\u22651.21 U/mL), measles (\u22650.60 CBER reference), and polio (\u22650.28 CBER reference) viruses in conformance with the US FDA guidance 21CFR 640 subpart J [9]. Although the FDA defines minimum concentrations of these antibodies, standards for antibodies against pathogens that are the most important to PIDD patients are not required. Titers of these antibodies in commercial polyclonal IG vary widely [10,11]. While the optimal dose of therapeutic polyclonal intravenous IG appears to be specific to the individual patient [4,12], increasing IG dosage is associated with better outcomes and a decrease in the incidence of infection [3,13]. Even with appropriate IG therapy, PIDD patients remain at an increased risk of infection, including those caused by upper and lower respiratory viral pathogens including RSV and influenza.",

At present, the only prophylactic treatment available for RSV infection is palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD), an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody that is used to confer seasonal passive immunity and has been shown to be effective in preventing RSV-related hospitalizations, particularly in low birthweight infants [15\u201317]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently revised its recommendation for use guidelines and available evidence suggest that use of this monoclonal antibody for RSV should be reserved only for patients born prematurely under 29 weeks gestation and under 1 year of age. There currently is no approved, recommended treatment for older age groups for the prevention of RSV disease. Although treatment of established disease is primarily supportive care, ribavirin (Virazole\u00ae) is the only FDA-approved treatment for RSV pulmonary infection in pediatric patients. Presently, the efficacy of ribavirin in RSV treatment is controversial and there is the potential for significant side effects in both patients and caregivers who administer it [18\u201323]. Because ribavirin is costly and must be administered in a hospital-based setting adding to the costs in the context of uncertain efficacy, an alternative therapy is needed. A polyclonal RSV-IVIG product (RespiGam\u00ae, MedImmune Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) enriched for antibodies against RSV derived from plasma donors with high-titers of anti-RSV antibodies was previously available and approved for the same indication as palivizumab, but was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market following approval of palivizumab. RI-002 was developed to meet an unmet medical need to provide both RSV protection and simultaneously supplement humoral immunity in patients with PIDDs or other immune compromised states.",

This hyperimmune globulin product was derived from a plasma pool of only a few hundred donors who had high neutralizing titers of anti-RSV antibody. The product was not developed for, nor was ever intended to be used in PIDD and as such, its manufacturing specifications did not adhere to FDA standards for collection of plasma from at least one thousand donors and was not tested for standard IG potency requirements. The product was never evaluated for efficacy in PIDD populations. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of this RSV-IVIG product in preventing RSV infection. In a study of 249 infants and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to congenital heart disease, or prematurity, 750 mg/kg of RespiGam reduced the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections (7 vs. 20 in the control group, p = 0.01), hospitalizations, hospital days, and days in intensive care [25]. In the PREVENT study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study conducted during the 1994\u20131995 RSV season, administration of 750 mg/kg RespiGam every 30 days reduced the incidence of hospitalizations due to RSV infection by 41% compared to placebo in 510 children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or a history of prematurity [26]. In addition, administration of RespiGam in the PREVENT study also reduced hospitalization for respiratory illness of any cause by 38% suggesting a protective effect for other, non-RSV-related respiratory tract infections. Additionally, a post hoc analysis of 109 of the 249 children in the Groothuis study demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in episodes of acute otitis media compared to the placebo group (0 vs. 5, p = 0.047) following immunoprophylaxis with 750 mg/kg of RespiGam, suggesting that the protective effects of RSV enriched hyperimmune globulins may not be limited to RSV alone [27].",

If these infants and children are receiving standard immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) monthly, physicians may consider substituting RSV-IGIV during the RSV season\u2019 [28]. This recommendation and subsequent clinical practice failed to consider that RespiGam did not meet 21CFR640 subpart J requirements that are intended to ensure appropriate immunoprophylaxis in this high-risk population. While the product was available, there were numerous published reports regarding the successful use of RespiGam for treatment and prevention of RSV in various at-risk immunocompromised patient populations [25,27,29\u201331]. There have also been reports that the efficacy of combination therapy of ribavirin + RSV-IVIG may lead to better outcomes than either product used alone [32]. RespiGam was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2004, at least in part because the newly approved anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, did not require IV access.

Further, the adult (\u226518 years old) survivors were treated with RI-001, on average, 13.4 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms while the non-survivors were not treated until 29 days after symptom onset. A similar trend was observed in pediatric patients (<18 years old) with survivors receiving RI-001 treatment earlier (19.8 days) than non-survivors (39.5 days). Similarly, the time from positive RSV test to first treatment with RI-001 was also shorter in survivors (adults, 3.6 days; children, 4.7 days) versus non-survivors (adults, 12.5 days; children, 8.5 days). Of note, RI-001 was associated with significant increases in RSV serum neutralizing antibody titer in a subset of 7 immunocompromised adults with good clinical outcomes that were enrolled in the compassionate use study [35]. These subjects experienced a 3\u2013151-fold rise in anti-RSV antibody titers compared to baseline for up to 30 days posttreatment. Taken together, these data suggest that early intervention with RI-001 is likely to be important in improving survival.

Enhanced levels of antibody to F protein and G protein (1.5-fold or greater compared to commercial IVIG lots) were observed in RI-002 lots compared to commercial IG, suggesting that selection of donors based on high anti-RSV titers in microneutralization assays enhances anti-RSV antibodies for multiple RSV surface proteins (Table 1).\n\n",

Orange et al. performed ELISA to evaluate virus-specific IgG titers for 9 respiratory viruses in RI-002 produced from 3 plasma pools and 10 commercially available IVIG lots representing 7 brands (Table 2) [11]. Respiratory viruses tested include influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3, hMPV, and coronavirus 229E and OC43.

RSV gene expression measured by qPCR confirmed systemic dissemination of RSV in lung, liver, and kidney as well as undetectable RSV RNA in lungs and diminished RNA levels in liver and kidney following treatment with RI-002. In the same study, pulmonary histopathology of immunosuppressed cotton rats treated with high-dose RI-002 was approximately equivalent to that observed in normal uninfected rats unlike the extensive inflammatory infiltration observed in lungs of saline-treated animals (Figure 1).

An equivalent prophylaxis study, in which immunosuppressed cotton rats were treated with RI-002 1500 mg/kg or 750 mg/kg 24 h prior to RSV challenge, showed a 3\u20134 log10 reduction in RSV viral titers from lung homogenates at both doses demonstrating that a single dose of RI-002 prior to exposure is sufficient to protect cotton rats from infection.\n",

Since a polyclonal antibody contains thousands of antibodies of different antigenic specificities, the concentration of each specificity can never be as high as that of a monoclonal which is of a single specificity. For this reason, higher doses of a polyclonal antibody would have to be administered compared to a monoclonal antibody to achieve comparable final concentrations of a given specificity. Palivizumab 15 mg/kg reduced wild-type RSV/A Tracy lung titers by greater than 2 logs but this decrease was not observed with the palivizumab-resistant strain. RI-002 1500 mg/kg reduced lung titers by greater than 2 logs in both wild-type and palivizumab-resistant strains compared to palivizumab (p \u2264 0.00001). An independently validated microneutralization assay established that mean RSV serum neutralizing titers from S. hispidus were increased by 1.5\u20131.9 log2 following prophylaxis with RI-002 versus palivizumab. These results were confirmed by a third laboratory that found an approximate 2 log reduction in viral load following prophylaxis with RI-002 1000 mg/kg and elimination of detectable virus with RI-002 1500 mg/kg. In the same study, virus was also eliminated from lung tissue by palivizumab 15 mg/kg (Figure 2). Reduction of RSV/A Long strain viral titer in the nasal tissue of normal cotton rats was also observed with both RI-002 doses and palivizumab at 15 mg/kg, with the greatest decrease achieved with RI-002 at 1500 mg/kg [38].\n",

The protective activity of RI-002 against multiple influenza strains has also been investigated in hemagglutination inhibition assays (HAI) and in the S hispidus model [49]. It is well established that protective activity against influenza correlates with HAI inhibition titers greater than 1:40 [53,54]. HAI inhibition titers from six lots of RI-002 were measured against 10 influenza strains. Protective titers ranging from 1:160 to 1:640 were observed for A (H1N1)pdm 09 control antigen (A/California), Influenza A (H3) (A/Texas/50/2012), Influenza B, Yamagata lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013), and Influenza B Victoria lineage (B/Brisbane/60/2008).

While RespiGam was not appropriately indicated for use in this population without additional supplementation, RI-002 may be uniquely poised to fill this therapeutic role. Data collected in the S. hispidus model for multiple agents has proven its reliability in predicting the efficacy of new therapeutic agents against RSV and, importantly, this model can be extended to young, elderly, and immunosuppressed populations. RI-002 achieved protective titers in S. hispidus, protected animals from infection, and was successful in maintaining normal lung histology and in eliminating infection in treated animals [11,33,34,50]. These findings extended to both immunocompromised animals and animals infected with palivizumab-resistant RSV [48,50\u201352]. Data collected in S. hispidus are similar to the trends observed in the phase II and compassionate use study of RI-001, which provided equivalent anti-RSV neutralizing titers compared to RI-002. The neutralizing titers that were reached in the animal model were on average twofold higher than that achieved with the clinical dosing regimen of palivizumab. Although limited in size, these studies demonstrate that RI-002 achieves high RSV neutralizing antibody titers that can be considered protective in humans and could result in improved outcomes in RSV-infected patients when treatment begins soon after the onset of symptoms.",

In addition to reduction in the incidence of serious bacterial infection and RSV, neutralizing antibody titers against other respiratory pathogens are also elevated [11]. In S. hispidus, RI-002 achieved protective titers against four strains of commonly circulating influenza, improved lung histology post-infection, reduced or eliminated influenza viral mRNA, and suppressed chemotactic signaling [49,50]. Taken together, these data suggest that a comparable effect is possible in humans although this remains to be determined. The process of enriching for anti-RSV antibodies within the donor pool is strongly correlated with increased antibody titers against other respiratory viruses and this finding is reproducible in all lots tested [10]. The impact of increased humoral protection against a range of commonly circulating respiratory viruses that pose a risk to PIDD patient is not yet known, although consistent supplementation with IG against respiratory illness is likely to be of clinical benefit based on previous data generated by the PREVENT study group.",

In addition to these patients, it could be used in patients who have been hospitalized with severe RSV respiratory infections who have not responded to conventional therapy.

Further, this selection also yields consistently higher (1.5-fold higher aggregate mean) neutralizing antibody titers against other respiratory pathogens.Evidence from S. hispidus preclinical testing demonstrates that RI-002 is effective for RSV treatment and prophylaxis in both normal and immunocompromised hosts and also shows some efficacy against commonly circulating strains of influenza. Further, RI-002 is protective against palivizumab-resistant RSV, probably because RI-002 contains antibodies targeting multiple RSV surface proteins.RI-002 was well tolerated in a Phase III clinical trial and met the primary efficacy endpoint of <1 serious bacterial infection per person year, with no serious bacterial infections documented over 56 person-years.",
