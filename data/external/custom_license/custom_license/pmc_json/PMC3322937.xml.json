In addition, information was collected regarding any clinical signs or symptoms in the worker up to 10 days after exposure, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, or radiographically confirmed pneumonia. A single convalescent-phase serum sample was collected from healthcare workers at least 28 days after their last exposure to the patient. In some situations early in the outbreak, samples were collected between days 22 to 28 early in the outbreak, consistent with CDC recommendations at the time. Serum samples were tested for anti\u2013SARS-CoV serum antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (9).",

One institution in which healthcare workers were exposed to two SARS-CoV\u2013positive patients was not included. Active surveillance performed by state and local public health officials, as well as hospital infection-control practitioners, identified no symptomatic healthcare workers among the exposed (J. Rosenberg, pers. comm.). Also, completeness of recruiting varied between institutions, although we had a high participation rate overall of approximately 85% of healthcare workers identified as being at high risk.",

Evidence from other studies shows that most case-patients case will seroconvert by day 20 (13).
