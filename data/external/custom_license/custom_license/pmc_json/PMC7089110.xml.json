Data from recent MERS-CoV outbreak investigations suggest that camels could be a source of human infections [2]. MERS-CoV sequences obtained from humans and camels in Oman, Qatar, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia revealed a close link between the virus detected in camels and that detected in people in the same geographic area [3\u20135]. However, the exact route of transmission from camels to humans remains unclear. MERS-CoV possible routes of transmission in humans and camels include camel-to-human, human-to-human, camel-to-camel, and human-to-camel. [6]. It is worth noting that the presence of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein as a viral receptor suggests that not only dromedary camels, but also other animal species may be potential targets of this virus [7].",

All assays were optimized by the use of a real-time 1-step RT-qPCR kit for analysis of viral RNA and cycling system (Roche Diagnostics).

The detection of MERS-CoV RNA in camels with pre-existing antibodies in a herd in KSA together with the lack of correlation between viral RNA loads and levels of neutralizing antibodies in camels for slaughter in Qatar indicated a limited immune protection and a potential for reinfection despite previous exposure [23, 24] Indeed, circulation up to 2\u20134 months of the same virus strains at the herd level has been demonstrated in other studies [21, 24].
