We also estimated the outbreak size required under alternate scenarios, including no additional exported cases to any other international destinations despite perfect case detection and 1 additional exported case to IRQ, AZE, or SYR (independently or to all 3 countries). Mean and 95% CIs are presented. The rate at which persons become infected while in Iran was assumed to be the same for residents and visitors. The rate of infection among air passengers (\u03bb) was estimated as number of exported cases \u00f7 person-time at risk while in Iran. Person-time at risk was calculated as number of outbound air passengers \u00d7 (average length of stay for visitors \u00d7 proportion of air passengers who are visitors + outbreak duration \u00d7 proportion of air passengers who are residents of Iran).\nOutbreak size in Iran was then estimated as \u03bb \u00d7 population size of Iran \u00d7 outbreak duration.
