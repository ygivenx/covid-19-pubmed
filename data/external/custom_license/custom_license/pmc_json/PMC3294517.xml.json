A case of pandemic influenza was defined as illness in a person with positive RT-PCR results for that virus. Further subtyping was conducted for 44 of 100 patients with positive influenza A but negative pandemic influenza virus results by NAT; all had positive results for seasonal influenza virus. Consequently, we defined a case of seasonal influenza as illness in a person with positive influenza A virus results by NAT but negative pandemic influenza virus results and in whom influenza subtyping for seasonal influenza virus by RT-PCR either produced positive results or was not conducted. A primary case was defined as illness in the first person in a cabin to report ILI symptoms; a co-primary case, as illness in a person who reported symptom onset within 24 hours after a primary case; and a secondary case, as illness in a person whose symptoms developed >24 hours after symptom onset in the primary case-patient. Case-patients were considered infectious for 24 hours before and 7 days after symptom onset. For the childcare center investigation, children who remained asymptomatic throughout the cruise were considered susceptible to influenza infection at each childcare session attended. Children in whom ILI developed were considered susceptible before the infectious period began.",

Consistent with findings in other studies, the symptoms of pandemic and seasonal influenza were similar (9\u201312). After adjusting for underlying medical conditions, we found that hospitalization rates and activity-limiting effects were higher for case-patients with seasonal than with pandemic influenza; however, this finding may be explained in part by differences in the age-specific attack rates.

Despite enhanced community awareness of the emerging pandemic, the ship\u2019s medical clinic staff underestimated the case count by 13-fold. The number of passengers who sought treatment at the ship\u2019s medical clinic does not accurately reflect the extent of the influenza outbreak on board, possibly because the decision to seek treatment may have been influenced by a number of factors including cost, severity of symptoms, and unwillingness to be isolated while on holiday.",

First, the case definition depended on NAT detection of virus in clinical samples, which may have resulted in misclassification of cases. Second, although the epidemiology is consistent with the first cases of pandemic influenza appearing in the childcare center, undetected or asymptomatic infected passengers or crew could have carried the viruses onto the ship. However, this scenario is unlikely because the symptoms developed in the index case-patient 2 days after embarkation. Third, although most ill passengers were interviewed within 2 days after onset of illness, interviews about severity, length of illness, and the experience in isolation and quarantine were conducted some weeks later, introducing possible recall bias. Fourth, although 2 cases of co-infection were detected, only the first 2 pandemic influenza\u2013positive specimens from childcare attendees were subtyped for other influenza A subtypes; it is possible that some of the remaining pandemic influenza case-patients were also infected with seasonal influenza. Fifth, some of the remaining pandemic influenza case-patients may have been co-infected. Sixth, the secondary attack rate for cabin contacts may be an overestimate because passengers with negative NAT results were not tested for other respiratory infections, and passengers with onset of symptoms >24 hours after symptoms developed in a cabinmate were assumed to be secondary, rather than co-primary cases.",

In some countries, isolation and quarantine measures have been used in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (15\u201318), but these measures have rarely been used for influenza control. In the influenza outbreaks reported here, direct follow-up of passengers in isolation and quarantine, supported by intense media coverage, resulted in a high degree of compliance and successful outbreak containment. Additionally, providing oseltamivir prophylaxis for crew members may have contributed to the successful containment of the infection during cruise B. Although the robust application of containment measures can stop the spread of novel influenza viruses, public health resource requirements are labor-intensive and expensive and may not be sustainable except for the most virulent of pandemic viruses.",
