The virus responsible was the Albiston Gorrie strain, which nucleotide sequence analysis revealed had an F0 cleavage signal of 112RRQKRF117 and an HN extension of seven amino acids [5]. It was not until the mid-1960s that it was recognized that Australia had its own endemic, avirulent strains of NDV, represented by the Queensland D26 and V4 strains [27]. These strains have since been characterized at the molecular level and shown to have avirulent F0 cleavage sites and HN extensions of 45 amino acids [25, 28]. Hooper et al. [13] reported that certain strains of NDV were involved in a respiratory form of the disease; however, these viruses were still considered to be of low virulence [14]. The first occurrence of virulent NDV since the 1930s occurred in NSW at Dean Park in 1998 [7]. These virulent viruses were characterized by sequence analysis and shown to have F0 cleavage sequences of 112RRQRRF117 and HN extensions of 45 amino acids. Using phylogenetic analysis, the virulent viruses were postulated to have emerged from an avirulent progenitor virus by the accumulation of two nucleotide changes at the F0 cleavage site [7, 8].",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated experimentally that the appearance of virulent NDVs can occur by the introduction of avirulent viruses into chickens followed by repeated passages in these bird populations [26]. Previous molecular analysis of NDV associated with outbreaks of virulent disease in chickens in Australia (1998\u20132002) demonstrated that some field isolates were capable of harbouring virulent virus in their quasispecies without causing overt clinical signs of disease [16]. In one particular field isolate (PR-32) isolated during this study, 26% of the quasispecies consisted of virulent viruses; however, when inoculated into birds, the virus appeared to be avirulent. In the quasispecies model of RNA virus genomes, mutations occur through errors made in the process of copying existing RNA genome sequences. Due to the ongoing production of mutant sequences during the replication of the RNA virus genome, the virus population is made up of a \u201cmutational cloud\u201d of closely related sequences referred to as quasispecies [6].",

Of interest, during the course of the NDV outbreak, several other viruses, notably the S vaccine strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were co-isolated with NDV, and it was decided to investigate the possible effect(s) of a co-existing infection with these viruses on that of NDV. To these ends, we have developed a real-time PCR that was capable of effectively detecting the presence of both virulent and avirulent sequences in a viral quasispecies and investigated some selection parameters that could affect changes in this ratio, such that virulent virus was able to replicate in the brain of a bird and alter what would generally be an apparent avirulent infection into an outbreak of virulent virus in chickens. We also investigated the rate at which nucleotide mutations occurred in the NDV genome with passage in tissue culture and in vivo, with particular attention paid to the F0 cleavage site of the F gene.",

Fourteen days after infection with NDV, brains from these birds were examined by PCR and immuno-peroxidase staining for the presence of NDV genome and antigens, respectively. The presence of virulent virus was confirmed in the brains and tissues of these birds by sequence analysis of PCR products, which identified the virus as being derived from the plaque-purified PR-32 isolate.\n",

However, using RRT-PCR (reverse transcription real-time PCR), which is used as a quantitative method to determine the presence of individual sequences within nucleic acid mixtures [19], it was possible to determine the ratio of virulent to avirulent F cleavage sequences within a mixed population of nucleic acid sequences to a much lower level of 1:1 \u00d7 10\u22123\u20131:5 \u00d7 10\u22123. This low level of virulent virus remains in the viral population without apparent affect in infected birds until a selection pressure is placed upon it. Infection of chickens with an NDV field isolate (PR-32) for which 26% of its viral population consisted of virulent virus was still defined by sequence analysis of the consensus sequence as an avirulent isolate. Moreover, the observed clinical signs in infected birds inoculated with this field isolate were also consistent with that of an avirulent infection, with no virulent clinical signs observed [16]. Thus, it appears that virulent sequences can remain undetected in the viral quasispecies until a selection pressure is placed upon the isolate so that the virulent virus becomes the dominant sequence present in the quasispecies and virulent clinical signs are observed upon infection.",

Avirulent plaque-purified NDV (98-1154) grown in CEF cells in the absence of trypsin resulted in the emergence of virulent virus after a period of 6\u20139 days of tissue culture, presumably due to mutations accumulating at the F0 cleavage site to alter the sequence to 112RRQRRF117. The level of virulent virus that emerged after tissue culture was shown by quasispecies distribution to increase from an undetectable level to 1\u201318% of the total viral population. Virulent virus was also demonstrated to be present in field isolates of NDV isolated in Australia in the 1980s, which belonged to a separate clade from those associated with the 1998\u20132002 NDV outbreaks. These latter viruses were shown to have HN extensions of seven amino acids. The presence of these virulent viruses in an avirulent background remained undetected until a selection pressure was applied. This observation demonstrated that there exist at least two clades of Australian ND viruses that are two nucleotides away from having a virulent F cleavage motif and have the potential to cause virulent NDV outbreaks.",

In the field, several mechanisms could be responsible for these selection pressures, e.g. tissue tropism or altered host states, such that replication of the virulent virus is favoured over that of an avirulent virus. One mechanism explored was the presence of a pre-existing avian virus prior to subsequent NDV infection. In many instances, field isolates of viruses from infected poultry contained other avian viruses such as the vaccine strain S of the coronavirus IBV, the birnavirus IBDV or NDV. Therefore, the possibility that a pre-existing viral infection could alter the tissue tropism of NDV was investigated.",

After a delay of several days, respiratory clinical signs began to appear, followed by the appearance of classic neural signs. Virulent virus was isolated from these birds from both neural tissue and swabs. Of interest were some of the birds that survived the transient expression of neural signs seen with the PR-32 virus and IBV pre-infection. The two birds that survived recovered completely within 24 h and thereafter could not be distinguished clinically from other birds in the flock. This had been observed with other birds infected with virulent NDV during the Australian outbreaks and may be an important factor in the ability to clearly diagnose the clinical signs associated with these viral infections. PCR amplification of tissues and cloacal swabs of the two surviving birds from the IBV experiment were negative for IBV and NDV at the termination of the experiment. It has been noted that if a prior infection with IBDV exists, this can cause transient immunosuppression in infected birds [4, 29]. This may explain the observation that after IBDV inoculation, NDV infection occurred and immunosuppression allowed rampant NDV replication of the PR-32 isolate, which then acquired a mutation at its F0 cleavage site. This virus could then reach neural tissue and replicate prior to elimination of the virus by the immune system, resulting in virulent virus dominating the quasispecies and with virulent clinical signs being seen in the infected bird.",

Thus, this method is unable to detect quite high levels of virulent virus hiding in the population, as was demonstrated with the original field isolate of PR-32. This isolate had a quasispecies population comprising 26% virulent sequences [16], but sequence analysis resulted in an avirulent consensus sequence. Thus, sequence analysis as currently performed may not detect virulent sequences present in field isolates of NDV. It has been postulated that virulent and avirulent NDV strains arose from each other by spontaneous mutation [17]. It is widely recognized that mixtures of virulent and avirulent viruses often co-exist in a single NDV sample, but only the majority phenotype is expressed [9]. This variation has been found regardless of whether the virus population originated from a single particle or from many. Most subpopulations in an NDV strain exist at ratios to each other that range from 1:1 to 1:50 [10]. Virulent strains of NDV have been found to be more consistently heterogeneous than strains of lower virulence [22].",

The fastest way to disrupt stable virus equilibrium is to change its adaptive landscape, which happens frequently in nature through the host immune response, infection of a new host or tissue or interference from defective interfering particles [12]. Thus, it may be inferred that outbreaks caused by virulent NDV can occur by coinfection with other viruses in poultry, followed by repeated NDV re-infection in these bird populations. The suggested implication of an involvement of immunosuppression in the emergence of virulent NDV (by IBDV) and the possibility that other avian viruses may exert an influence on the host are worthy of further investigation.",
