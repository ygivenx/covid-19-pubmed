Identification and analysis of RNA viruses are important for the diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of human and animal infectious diseases [4]. Since the development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, great progress has been made in the rapid identification and characterization of RNA viruses [5\u20138]. Numerous viruses and variant strains have been identified using NGS approaches. Unlike insensitive traditional virological methods and highly specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), NGS methods have the advantage of being able to sequence total or targeted DNA and RNA from samples in an unbiased way, without a priori knowledge of the possible viral agent(s) present, thus making them the ideal tool for novel and divergent viral genome discovery. This facilitates research in virus ecology, novel virus discovery, and the development of larger datasets of complete virus genomes for studies on virus evolution and pandemic prediction.",

Among these platforms, Ion Torrent PGM is competitive for detection of viruses and bacteria with respect to instrumental price, sequencing cost, and simplicity of operation, although its sequencing throughput is lower than MiSeq and Proton [10]. Each NGS platform has its own sequencing library preparation procedure. A suitable pipeline of library construction is very essential for virus genome sequencing by NGS. In order to establish the NGS platform in diagnosis and surveillance of viral infection, we developed a NGS library preparation method based on RT-PCR random primers. The effectiveness and practicality to identify viruses and sequence their genomes using this method are discussed in this study.",

The swab sample was collected through taking smears at both cloacal and oropharyngeal tracts, and stored in 1.5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol [10, 12]. The sample was negative for Avian influenza virus (AIV) detection, but caused death to specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs in 72 h. The swab sample was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7g for 5 min, and the supernatants were inoculated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs via the allantoic sac route. The SPF embryonated eggs were purchased from Shandong Healthtec Laboratory Animal Breeding Company (Jinan, China). The inoculated eggs were further incubated for 3 days, and checked twice each day during the incubation period. Dead ones were picked out and stored in a refrigerator. After the incubation period, allantoic fluid was collected to evaluate the unknown virus identification ability of the cDNA library preparation method and the suitable length of reverse transcription time for the first stand cDNA synthesis in the library construction process. Another unknown virus sample was taken from the mixed feces of 52 dead ducks in a poultry farm of Shandong province, China, in June 2014. The fecal sample was collected from approximately 0.5-ml wet and fresh feces, and stored in 3.5 ml PBS (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol [10, 12]. The samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C and tested in 3 days after collection. The samples were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C after detection.",

During the synthesis of the second strand cDNA, the other adaptor was introduced. Primers based on the two adaptors were used to generate the expected cDNA library. The application of random primers in sequencing viral genomes has been reported previously, but reverse transcription time for the first strand cDNA synthesis is variable. To meet the requirements of NGS on a PGM platform, it is better to produce a cDNA library with DNA fragment sizes between 200 and 500 bp. To decide a suitable reverse transcription time for first strand cDNA synthesis in the preparation of NGS library samples, the size distribution and concentration of the first strand cDNA synthesis produced with different reverse transcription times were analyzed by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, in the NGS library preparation of the first sample. First strand cDNA synthesis produced from reverse transcription times of 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, and 60 min of the first sample were selected for the analysis.",

From these, 2,257,158 (49.62%) reads belong to host cellular organisms, 1472 (0.03%) reads belong to viruses, and 2,134,992 (46.93%) reads belonged to \u201cnot assigned\u201d group, which matched the sequence without taxon ids in the GenBank nucleotide database. There were 155,266 (3.41%) reads in the \u201cno hits\u201d group, which did not match any sequence in GenBank nucleotide database. Among the virus reads, 622 belong to Caudovirales (42.26%) and 82 (5.57%) belong to Paramyxoviruses. In the uncultured duck fecal sample collected from Shandong, a total of 2,072,054 reads were produced by Ion Torrent PGM NGS. The average read length was 183 bp, and GC content is 45.93%. From these, 758,547 (36.61%) reads belong to host cellular organisms; 70,430 (3.40%) reads belonged to the \u201cnot assigned\u201d group, and 1,220,605 (58.91%) reads belonged to the \u201cno hits\u201d group. Because the sample had not been cultured, most reads were non-hit vial genome sequences. There were 22,472 reads (1.08%) in the \u201cviruses\u201d group, including 18 families (Table 2) and 4190 Phages reads. Most (84.75%) of the reads belonged to Coronaviridae. The main pathogen infecting the ducks was coronavirus.",

            "text": "It is important to develop a method which would not require prior knowledge of the virus. Identification methods based on culture have disadvantages, such as long turnaround time, increased biohazard risks, and culture bias. Improvements in sequencing and detection technologies over the past 15 years have led to increased detection rates of existing, neglected, and unknown pathogens. To identify unknown viruses by NGS, a shotgun sequencing DNA library or a cDNA library synthesized from RNA with random priming RT-PCR is often used. These methods may result in a huge amount of host cell sequences included in the sequencing data, even in a sample with a very high percentage of viral RNA [16, 17]. Library construction methods based on random primers were reported and applied in viral genome sequencing by NGS platforms [18, 19]. In this method, although host genomic DNA and rRNA was depleted by centrifugation, filtration, and naked DNA/RNA digestion to increase the percentage of viral-specific RNA in the sample, there was also a huge number of host cell and bacterium sequences achieved by NGS. The key to lowering the amount of host contamination is not only the sample pre-processing but also the library preparation method. In order to generate a large number of target size distributions in the NGS library, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used to characterize size distribution during the random primer reverse transcription over various incubation times. The results showed that a reverse transcription time for 30 min can produce cDNA fragments with an average size of 353 bp. Although the experiment has not been replicated several times, this part of the study was useful in the further research of the relationship between the reverse transcription time and the first strand cDNA fragment sizes, as well as in obtaining a library with suitable fragment sizes and enhancing the quality and quantity of sequencing data. The method has been replicated and compared to the existing standard RNA-seq library preparation protocol. The results showed that more classified viral families and genera were identified using this method than the others [10].",

In the cultured swab sample collected from a healthy duck from Guizhou province, only Paramyxovirinae was detected. In the uncultured fecal sample mixed from 52 dead ducks in a poultry farm of Shandong province, 12 families of animal virus (Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Retroviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, Nimaviridae, Circoviridae), 4 families of plant virus (Potyviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Virgaviridae, Nimaviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae), 2 families of insect virus (Dicistroviridae, Togaviridae,) were identified. The 12 families of animal virus were the main viruses infecting the 52 dead ducks in the farm, which were not the virus infecting one duck. Regarding some virus (Zucchini yellow mosaic virus, Sindbis virus, and Diatraea saccharalis densovirus), they were assumed to be from duck feed sources, as similar viruses had been identified from plants, insects, or shrimps previously. Interestingly, the number of the reads hitting to Avian encephalomyelitis virus was lower than the virus infecting plants and insects. The reason might be that the detected host was not in shedding period of Avian encephalomyelitis virus, which was less than 5 days in adults [20].",
