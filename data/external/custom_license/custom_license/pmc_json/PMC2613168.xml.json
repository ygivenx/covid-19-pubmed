Some authors have argued32 that the \u201cTrue Interactome\u201d should be defined as all possible interactions encoded by a genome\u2014 i.e., the set of all pairwise protein interactions that occur in at least one biological condition or cell type. The assumption is that every true interaction will be detectable by some assay, and that given enough independent measurements, most of the interactome could be detected. Many assay types have been described for detecting protein-protein interactions, a few of which have been adapted to large-scale screening1,32\u201334. On the other hand, some interactions may be immeasurable by any available assay, or will not arise in the conditions surveyed. Therefore, we use the term \u201cMappable Interactome\u201d for the subset of true pairwise interactions that are reproducibly detectable by any given assay method or combination of methods.",

For pools that test positive, pairwise tests are immediately conducted between the bait and each prey in the pool (phase II\u2014this second phase can also be conducted by sequencing3,5). The benefit of pooling is that large numbers of potential interactions can be sampled at relatively low cost. This comes at the expense of FNR, as the chance a true interaction is missed in the pool is higher than the chance it would be missed by direct pairwise tests38. Through simulation, we found that basic two-phase pooling (Pooling strategy) does indeed achieve a four- to five-fold reduction in coverage cost over pairwise testing (~4 million plates for Pooling compared to ~20 million plates for Basic-serial, Table 1). However, assuming the rate of interaction screening of a typical laboratory (e.g., ~2400 plate-matings per person per year), pooled screens would still require approximately 1700 person-years to achieve completion of the Drosophila protein network.",

All probabilities start at the background frequency of interaction for random protein pairs (as for Basic-serial and Pooling). Protein interactions are initially tested using pooled screening, and after each two-phase pooled experiment the probabilities increase for interactions that are observed and decrease for interactions that are tested but not observed. Unlike previous strategies, however, protein pairs with probability greater than an upper threshold (i.e., 95%) are declared to be definite \u201cinteractors\u201d and are removed from subsequent testing (Fig. 1b). Likewise, interactions with probability beneath a lower threshold are declared to be \u201cnon-interactors\u201d and are also removed from further consideration. The motivation for thresholding is to more quickly exclude the overwhelming number of non-interacting protein pairs. Finally, candidate interactions are defined as those with probabilities between the upper threshold and background. When candidates are available they are always tested immediately using pairwise assays, before resorting to pooling, until their probabilities are pushed above the upper threshold or below background. The motivation for prioritizing candidate interactions is to more quickly cover the interactions likely to be positive. Overall, Thresholding resulted in more than a two-fold cost reduction compared to Pooling (Table 1 and Fig. 3a).",

A variety of prediction methods have been proposed based on evolutionary conservation39\u201341\u2014i.e., transfer of interaction measurements from one species to another\u2014or based on integrating conservation with additional features such as co-expression and co-annotation42\u201347. Such predictions impact the experimental design by setting the prior probabilities of interaction for each protein pair in lieu of background probabilities. In the Prediction strategy, we explored the effect of setting these prior probabilities using theoretical prediction methods simulated over a range of predetermined prediction accuracies (a range of different values for FPR, FNR, and corresponding FDR of the predictions). We found that even predictors with very high FDRs could have a major impact on the mapping cost (Table 1 and Fig. 3b). For example, a predictor with 92.2% FDR gave a four-fold reduction in cost over Pooling, with a >50-fold reduction in cost to achieve 50% coverage and a savings of hundreds of fold in the early stages of mapping. Moreover, the 92.2% FDR means that even a predictor that makes 12 false predictions for every true one can lead to a major reduction in the cost of interactome completion. The best prediction method required approximately 385 person-years to achieve 95% coverage of the Drosophila protein network and 12 person-years to achieve 50% coverage. Thus, while obtaining full coverage of an interactome map may still be some years away, a draft scaffold providing half coverage might be feasibly achieved by a team of ~12 technicians working over a period of one year.",

We used this approach to generate 24,798 high confidence predictions. We randomly selected 2,047 of these for testing using forward-orientation Y2H and, as above, retested the negative pairs using reverse-orientation Y2H (for which clones were available). In total, this procedure added 279 new high-confidence interactions to the map for a 13.6% success rate. Combined over both conservation-based and multiple-evidence-based predictions, 450 new protein-protein interactions were added to the Drosophila map using 47 96-well plates (Fig. 3a,b). To establish the background rate of interaction, we also tested 2,354 randomly chosen pairs, 72 of which were positive yielding a 3% background rate (Fig. 4b). These results show that both types of prediction are highly enriched for true interactions.

The second set of predictions, made by integrating various lines of evidence, had a lower success rate than the predictions based solely on conservation.

Our study makes it clear that achieving 95% coverage of an interactome requires many more screens than one pass through all pools or over all protein pairs. If complete coverage is to be obtained in the near future, it will be necessary to invoke better strategies for experimental design, technologies reporting fewer false negatives, or both. In terms of experimental design, we have shown that the cost of completion is reduced substantially by careful ordering of pooled screens. In terms of technology, our study underscores the importance of decreasing the FNR or of different assays that provide independent samples of a protein pair. Even if the error rates are lower than assumed here, advanced mapping strategies are still likely to be worthwhile (Suppl. Table 1). Here we have used two types of Y2H assay, forward and reverse orientations, to obtain multiple samples which appear largely independent. If the assays were partially dependent, multiple tests might still be worth the cost as long as they were not perfectly correlated (and the dependence could be handled quantitatively using a statistical model). In the present study, the conditional independence assumption leads to a \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d or lower-bound on the number of interaction tests that will likely be required to achieve full coverage of an interactome. Further work will be needed to better characterize the relative dependencies among the wide range of other interaction assays that are currently available\u2014 if the current assays are highly dependent, then the required number of tests will be greater than was estimated here.",

The interaction probabilities and experimental history are used to design a 96-well plate Y2H experiment according to one of the strategies. The result of this experiment is simulated based on the detectability of the tested interactions (given the assay type) and the pooling sensitivity. The new experimental results are recorded in the history and also (b) used to update the interaction probabilities of the relevant protein pairs. The pyramid represents the ordered list of protein pairs ranked by probability. It is wider at the bottom than at the top to reflect that most pairs are negative\u2014i.e., most pairs will have low probability and only a few pairs will percolate to the top of the list with high probability. Interactions with probability above an upper threshold are added to the mapped interactome, which is compared to the simulated \u201cTrue Network\u201d at intervals of 1,000 plates for reporting coverage and FDR.",
