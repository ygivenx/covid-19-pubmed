Some say the policy, together with the earlier dissolution of the state monopoly on purchasing vaccines, will make the biotech sector in China more competitive and allow entry of foreign vaccine developers. Others believe it can put new vaccines onto the Chinese market if vaccine companies invest in research and introduce marketing strategies that raise awareness among the general population of the need for vaccines.",

That measure comes on the heels of a new rule introduced in June 2005, where the Chinese cabinet deregulated the vaccine sector, thus breaking the monopoly of the State-controlled Chinese Center for Disease Control (CDC) to purchase vaccines. The new measure allows local hospitals and desease control departments to buy commercial vaccines directly from producers for the first time.",

Triprime Biotech's president Cheng, who has participated in the discussion on the policy, says that for each eligible vaccine developer, at least several million Yuans (8 Yuans equal $1) of funding will be available. \u201cIf we could obtain the financial support from NDRC, it will be easier for us to speed up the clinical trial process,\u201d comments Zixin Qiu, president of Beijing-based Wantai Biopharmaceutical. \u201cThe overall strength of our company will be improved.\u201d",

In November 2003, Beijing-based, AMEX-listed Sinovac Biotech developed the first vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). And in November 2005, China's State Food and Drug Administration gave the green light for Sinovac to launch the clinical trial for a human H5N1 avian flu vaccine. Last December, Wantai Biopharmaceutical completed phase 2 testing of a new vaccine against hepatitis E virus.",

And the market does not belong to Chinese biotech firms alone. According to Yin, major foreign developers, such as London-based GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine subsidiary of Sanofi Aventis located in Lyons, France, and Chiron, now part of Novartis, Basel, have already conquered about half of the Chinese commercial vaccine market.",

Compared with the vaccine landscape of mature markets, there are still too many vaccine producers in China; there are about 28 major vaccine developers in the country according to Yin's estimates. But few of them have a sales volume of more than RMB 100 ($12) million. The cutthroat competition has therefore severely thinned their profits. Yongqiang Wu, an executive of the strategy planning department at the state-owned vaccine company China National Biotech, says the low profit margin has made it very diffictult for the largest biotech firm in China to reinvest money in research and to improve vaccine production techniques\u2014unlike their foreign competitors.",

In China, people are poorly informed about vaccinations. Most adults, for example, think they received all the necessary vaccinations before they were two years old. Therefore, a vaccine marketing strategy has to be focused not only on how good a product is, but also on why it is necessary for an individual to get vaccinated. For businesses to do this on their own is an enormous task, if not a burden.",
