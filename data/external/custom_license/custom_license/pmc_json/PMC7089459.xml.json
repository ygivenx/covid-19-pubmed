It is the first country in Asia to implement an influenza vaccination program by the health authority for all hospital health care at no charge since the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The influenza vaccine is also available for the general public not included in the above groups, but with a charge. Almost all hospital employees are reported to receive the vaccine. Overall, about 68.4% of people in high-risk groups and about 10% of the general population receive the vaccine each year [1]. This high vaccination rate can be attributed to the fact that risk-groups receive it free of charge, and also to the promotion of vaccination in the mass media. In November 2005 about 60% of the high-risk groups received the vaccine because of the fear for the outbreak of the bird-flu.",

They found that the vaccination rates are still low in western countries although the effectiveness in reducing influenza infections, absenteeism and also the cost saving have been shown in some studies [13]. The main reasons given for not being vaccinated were: do not think it was needed, not aware of the vaccine and concerned about side-effects as well as low effectiveness of the vaccine. But the vaccination rates in our country are almost 100%, because our health authority provides the influenza vaccination program to all healthcare workers at no charge. This mass vaccination program is expensive, and there are only very few studies that evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an implemented vaccination program, except some studies conducted nearly two decades ago. Therefore, we conducted this pilot study to assess whether the mass vaccination program for all healthcare workers was cost-effective.",

Therefore this pilot study was conducted to determine if there was a potential savings by hospitals delivering free influenza vaccine to employees. Although the preliminary result of present study showed that the providing free influenza vaccine to healthcare workers in the selected hospital may reduce the incidence of ILI, absenteeism and the financial losses associated with absenteeism during the influenza season, the results of this study may have potential biases. The bias may result from the fact that the number of non-vaccinated subjects was much lower than the number of vaccinated subjects. This big difference in the number of employees in the two groups was due to the provision of free vaccination and the requirement that all employees should be vaccinated.",
