The Ethics Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, approved the study. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 169 hospitalized children, ages 7 days\u201315 years, of whom 104 had respiratory symptoms, 23 had enteric disease, and 3 had both (4). The mean age of the study population was 19.6 months (median 7 months). Viral nucleic acid was extracted from specimens by using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA was then submitted to reverse transcription PCR with a High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) by using random primers according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA obtained was screened with primers able to amplify a 220-bp product in the conserved polymerase region of all known HCoVs (5) and other coronaviruses (e.g., bovine coronavirus). We used cDNA obtained from cultured human rectal tumor cell line HRT-18G cells inoculated with bovine coronavirus strain Kakegawa as positive controls for PCR.",

This nested assay was designed on an alignment of our HKU1-positive sample sequence (BRA169) and different HKU1 genotype sequences deposited in GenBank. Primers Fn-HKU1 (forward 5\u2032-CGTGCYATG CCAAATATTTTGCG-3\u2032, HKU1-NC_006577, nt 15433\u201315454) and Rn-HKU1 (reverse 5\u2032-TAGCAACCGCCACACATAAC-3\u2032, HKU1-NC_006577, nt 15562\u201315581) produced an amplicon of 149 bp. The nested PCR was run in a 50-\u00b5L reaction comprising 10 \u00b5L of PCR product, 1.5 units of DNA Polymerase (Biotools, Madrid, Spain), 1 \u00b5mol/L of each primer, 200 \u00b5mol/L of each dNTP (Applied Biosystems), 2 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1\u00d7 buffer. PCR mixtures were heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 62\u00b0C, and 40 s at 72\u00b0C, followed by a final 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Clinical samples positive for HKU1 were used as positive controls in the HKU1 nested PCR. All fragments obtained from PCR and nested PCR were analyzed in a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel by electrophoresis, stained with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL of ethidium bromide, and subsequently sequenced to confirm the type of coronavirus. Nucleotide sequencing reactions were performed on both amplicon strands by using an ABI PRISM Big Dye Cycle Sequencing Kit with the ABI PRISM 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems).",
