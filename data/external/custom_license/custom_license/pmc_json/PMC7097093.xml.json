Dubbed Bombali after the district where the bats were captured, this new species is the first Ebola virus to have its initial identification in an animal host rather than from a sick person. According to Tracey Goldstein, associate director of the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis, who led the team behind the research, it isn't yet clear whether Bombali can infect people in the field, although it has been shown to infect cultured human cells1.",

For instance, scientists still can't purify the viral content in a given sample completely. Some may be lost during filtration, for example. And the short reads that one gets from sequencing often have uncertain origins: they could be viral or derived from some other microbe. To confirm their sources, scientists stitch the reads together into 'contigs', or longer sequences that may have recognizable functions. According to Roux, that process requires bioinformatic algorithms that look for features unique to viruses that other microbes don't share. For instance, newly formed viruses\u2014but not other microbes\u2014come wrapped in a protein capsid that can give away their identity. And microbial sequences that look completely unlike anything seen previously are often assumed to be viral simply because they are so novel. \u201cSay you've gotten ten genes in your contig, and one looks like it encodes for a capsid, and the other nine genes are totally new and we have no idea what they're doing,\u201d Roux says. \u201cThat's what you'd expect with a new virus genome.\u201d",

To further characterize those viruses, PREDICT researchers will isolate them or, if need be, synthesize them to see how they behave and replicate in a cellular host.

Newer sequencing tools, he says, provided an opportunity to investigate whether these fragments were indeed viral, as opposed to bacterial, human \u201cor just low-quality reads.\u201d Others had found that 95% of DNA sequences in blood were from human cells, and they typically ignored the rest. Telenti wanted to characterize those residual sequences, since the presence of pathogenic viruses in transfusion blood products (for example, red cells, platelets and plasma) constitutes a major hazard, particularly for immunocompromised patients. So, with funding from Human Longevity in San Diego, a company cofounded by J. Craig Venter (who was a coauthor on the subsequent publication but has since retired), he led a team that sequenced blood samples from more than 8,000 healthy participants in a large-scale investigation of the whole human genome. The findings revealed 94 different phages and eukaryotic viruses8. Although Telenti says some were likely introduced as contaminants in sequence reagents, he posits that the others, which include species from the Herpesviridae (herpesviruses) and Anelloviridae (for example, the torque teno virus), may reside permanently in healthy blood. \u201cSometimes viruses will attack us, but we also have to embrace the fact there's probably much more symbiosis than we anticipated,\u201d Telenti says. \u201cEveryone seems to have a herpesvirus, so you have to wonder why they might be useful.\u201d One possibility, Telenti adds, is that persistent, latent herpesviruses have roles in modulating and \u201ceducating the immune system.\u201d",

He's now exploring how phage composition varies in response to new IBD treatments. That research was prompted by findings showing that the gut's bacterial composition varies in tandem with IBD flareups and remissions. Plevy describes those bacterial changes as merely \u201cthe tip of the iceberg in terms of the diagnostic information we can extract from the gut.\u201d Corresponding phage changes, he says, could offer even deeper insights into how patients respond to therapeutic interventions. And ideally, that could pave the way toward phage therapy\u2014using phages as medical treatments to kill the bacteria that might cause or exacerbate IBD.",

The field of virome research is a decade behind the study of the microbiome, according to Wang, and many of the tools that are being used to do functional testing of elements of the microbiome (fecal transplantation, gnotobiotic mice, and even antibiotics) are simply not available for the virome. \u201cThe first [thing we have to do] is to develop culture systems for any virus that we find an association for. If we don't have a culture system, we can't begin to try to do infection experiments in different settings,\u201d he says. Wang has developed one of the few systems to date for culturing a novel virus detected in human stool. In a 2017 paper, his group described a Caco-2 culture system for astrovirus VA1/HMO-C, which is prevalent in human encephalitis12. But, he points out, this is only the first step. Once it is established that a novel virus infects human cells, animal models will have to be established to study pathogenicity. According to Wang, until these systems are developed\u2014and they are both challenging to implement and difficult to get funding for\u2014the field will be limited to association studies.",

And it's going to take a dedicated effort, not something a microbiome company can do by having one or two scientists looking at viruses, according to Radovic-Moreno.
