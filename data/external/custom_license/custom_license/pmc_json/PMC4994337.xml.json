Contact tracing was initiated immediately after we detected the case-patient. We communicated with the airline and bus operators to collect passenger information and undertook personal interviews in related communities. A hotline was set up, and the case-patient\u2019s travel information was published in the media. We investigated hotline callers and identified suspected contacts. We also reviewed video footage from closed circuit television in hotels and restaurants visited by the case-patient, enabling us to identify contacts and measure duration and distance of exposures. Information about bus passengers was limited; consequently, with help from police departments, we analyzed video footage recorded by public surveillance cameras at bus stations and surrounding communities and traced the whereabouts of related passengers.",

Evidence supports this aggressive policy. First, the MERS outbreak in South Korea, from where the case-patient traveled, was ongoing, and superspreading was observed there (9,10). Second, the patient was symptomatic and potentially infectious during his travel and stay in China. Previous clusters have been detected in hospitals and households (11\u201313), and MERS-CoV transmission might occur in enclosed settings.

Publicizing information and hotlines can facilitate contact tracing and risk communication and helped us identify >50% of the case-patient\u2019s travel contacts. However, we also had to rule out large numbers of false hotline calls that resulted from inaccurate recall and excessive worry. Review of video footage is another active solution for identifying contacts, especially for anonymous contacts. In our investigation, we directly located some bus passengers who resided near the station by reviewing footage from surveillance cameras. Other bus passengers left the station by private cars, which were captured by cameras. Our inquiries into car registration information traced these contacts successfully. Reviewing video footage can also measure a contact\u2019s exposure objectively and quantitatively. Investigators should combine and compare video footage meticulously to gather pieces of information.

Furthermore, lack of knowledge about MERS made some contacts less willing to comply with mandatory monitoring. Nevertheless, we traced and monitored all contacts eventually. We suggest combining multiple approaches and data sources beyond ordinary investigation to trace contacts of persons with imported cases of MERS. ",
