Past epidemiologic studies used routine diagnostic methods such as culture for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens [7, 38]. However, viral culture requires 3 to 5 days to detect most agents and detects rhinovirus or coronaviruses poorly or not at all. Multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR has been shown to be more sensitive than standard respiratory virus culture, bacterial culture, and antigen detection methods [5, 8, 18, 27]. Moreover, PCR is much faster. For the recently characterized hMPV, RT-PCR-based techniques are generally the method of choice for detection [35]. No antigen detection methods are commercially available for hMPV.",

Studies have shown that older adult patients shed lower titers of viruses, which demands the use of a highly sensitive methodology such as RT-PCR over conventional culture or DFA [36]. It is possible that the multiplex PCR assays now available may still not be sensitive enough to detect the lower titers of virus shed by older adult patients. It is also possible that adult patients may have other bacterial infections causing the respiratory infections that are not detected by the PCR, such as Legionella or Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

Young children may seek healthcare earlier in the course of disease, and the reasons for testing in young children may be different in adults compared to children and young adults.",

For example, some investigators have advocated performing multiplex respiratory PCR on all symptomatic infants during the RSV season, recommending that the RSV-positive patients be cohorted and placed on gown and glove precautions, noting a reduction in nosocomial infection in newborn nurseries after putting such practices into place [19, 37]. Ideally, active respiratory PCR surveillance could help predict seasonal respiratory epidemics so that additional infection control measures can be instituted.",

Some of the pathogens detected in the multiplex PCR have specific therapies [2]. The multiplex respiratory PCR detects three bacterial pathogens that can all be treated with specific antibiotics, including C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, and B. pertussis. Adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors are available for the influenza viruses. Intravenous polyclonal immune globulin enriched against RSV and palivzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion glycoprotein, have been recommended for high-risk infants. Ribavirin has been also been approved for use with RSV and has had some apparent success in cases of infection with hMPV, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses. Most conventional immunoglobulin preparations seem to contain sufficient amounts of neutralizing titers against hMPV.",
