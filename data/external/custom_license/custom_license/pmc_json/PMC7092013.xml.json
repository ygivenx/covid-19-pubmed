The best-characterized early onset lung injury after SCT is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), whereas bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP) occur later in the post transplant period. The most common complication is the idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), which is defined as evidence of widespread alveolar injury in the absence of lower respiratory tract infection15 and may develop in the early but more commonly in a later setting.

Recently, it was shown in a group of 53 patients that the rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity was low after non-myeloablative conditioning without irradiation: infectious pneumonia occurred in nine patients, two patients developed IPS and no cases of DAH or BO were encountered.10 The overall incidences of acute GVHD grade I/II, grade III/IV and extensive chronic GVHD were 19, 19 and 11%, respectively. Another report demonstrated that reduced-intensity conditioning decreased the incidence of BO, whereas chronic GVHD was not a risk factor.38 Moreover, non-myeloablative patients experienced a significantly lower rate of lung function decline after SCT than myeloablative patients.39 Both the intensity of the conditioning regimen (conventional versus non-myeloablative) and the occurrence of severe acute GVHD (grades III\u2013IV) were prognostic for the development of IPS in a multiple regression analysis.7 In our large cohort, patients with pulmonary complications and controls were comparable with respect to well-known risk factors for lung injury, and acute GVHD \u2a7egrade II was significantly related with pulmonary toxicity. There was no difference in the incidence of acute GVHD between patients with infectious and those with non-infectious pulmonary complications. We could not identify viral respiratory tract infections as a risk factor for progression to lung injury. Interestingly, we noted an association between pulmonary complications and CMV reactivation, which is not among previously reported risk factors. Therefore, the role of CMV reactivation and the effect of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy on the development of pulmonary complications deserve further evaluation.",
