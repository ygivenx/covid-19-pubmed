Many viruses are known to manipulate this pathway in favor of their replication, such as influenza A virus [29], hepatitis B virus [16], hepatitis C virus [17], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [23], Jun\u00edn virus [19], human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [20], bovine herpesvirus type 1 [40] and infectious bursal disease virus [34].

            "text": "\nIn vivo, the virus shows a very narrow cell tropism and infects a specific subpopulation of porcine macrophages [13, 33]. In vitro, efficient PRRSV replication is only observed in primary pig macrophages (e.g., alveolar macrophages), differentiated monocytes [13] or cells derived from African green monkey kidney, such as MARC-145 [18]. For easy manipulation, MARC-145 cells provide an important tool for the study of PRRSV replication. Previously, it was reported that the PI3K/Akt pathway is regulated by PRRSV in a complex manner in Mo-DCs [37], but whether this is a universal phenomenon in all permissive cells is unknown. A number of studies have shown that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is functionally dependent on downstream substrates of Akt such as FoxO1, Bad and mTOR for regulation of cell survival [3, 11, 15, 25]. The downstream targets of Akt controlled by PRRSV have not been identified. The objective of this study was to address how the PI3K/Akt pathway is modulated in infection of MARC-145 cells and PAMs with highly pathogenic PRRSV. We demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt pathway was activated by HP-PRRSV in a cell-culture-dependent manner and that the downstream targets FoxO1 and Bad were regulated through this pathway. In addition, we found that activated PI3K was required for the development of CPE in MARC-145 cells, but not for production of infectious progeny.",

Thus the UV-irradiated HP-PRRSV virus was employed to address this issue. Under the conditions described above, the virus could be completely inactivated (data not shown). Such inactivated virus fails to express viral proteins due to the formation of thymidine dimers, which prevent the transcription of viral genes but do not interfere with the capacity of the virus for receptor binding and entry into host cells by endocytosis [2]. As showed in Fig. 3, the exposure of cells to UV-irradiated virus led to phosphorylation of Akt at 5 and 15 min postinfection in PAMs (Fig. 3B), but not in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 3A). This indicates that virus-cell interactions during the binding or entry process are probably responsible for this event in PAMs, whereas in MARC-145 cells, a different mechanism may account for this activation.\n",

Compared to the mock-infected control, virus replication resulted in significantly increased phosphorylation of both FoxO1 and Bad, while no change in mTOR was observed (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation with both FoxO1 and Bad were most evident at 24 h p.i., which corresponds in time to the change in phosphorylated Akt.

            "text": "Many viruses interfere with signaling pathways in their infected host cells to favor productive infection, which can also impact on the physiology of the host cell as well as pathogenesis. Therefore, the identification of cellular factors involved in virus replication is important for the design of novel antiviral strategies. In this regard, the manipulation of cellular pathways regulating cell apoptosis or survival affords great advantages to virus replication [35], and many viruses have been demonstrated to regulate cell survival via the regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway [4, 14]. A previous report has indicated that the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in the early phase and subsequently inhibited at 12 h p.i. during PRRSV infection of Mo-DCs [37]. Here, HP-PRRSV strain HuN4 was used to further investigate how and why this pathway is controlled by the virus. Here, we report that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway was significantly enhanced by the HuN4 virus at both the early and late stage of infection of MARC-145 cells, while a distinct pattern was adopted during infection of PAMs in which the phosphorylation of Akt occurred exclusively in the early stage, as early as 5 min p.i., and then returned to the basal level at 45 min p.i. (Figs. 1A and 2). When the cells were exposed to the UV-irradiation-inactivated virus, significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt was observed in PAMs, but not in MARC-145 cells. Entry of macrophages by PRRSV occurs via a few similar but also different mechanisms compared to entry into MARC-145 cells [12]. It could be inferred that the virus entry process in PAMs was enough to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, while a different mechanism of activation was used in MARC-145 cells. It is possible that a different entry mechanism results in this difference in the regulation of Akt. Together with previous data reported by Zhang et al. [37], we generalize that PRRSV regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway by different mechanisms in Mo-DCs, PAMs and MARC-145 cells.",

They are normally regulated in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. For example, the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser-136) was decreased but the phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448) and FoxO1 (Ser256) was increased by infection with varicella-zoster virus [27]. Similarly, it has been shown that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade contributes to the establishment of persistent HCV infection [21]. In the present study, we demonstrated that both FoxO1 and Bad were regulated by PRRSV through the control of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the late stage of infection in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 4), and therefore the, PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 and PI3K/Akt/Bad cascades may be manipulated by PRRSV to control host-cell survival.",

For example, this pathway has been shown to be involved in the regulation of Ebola virus entry of host cells [28], to contribute to arenavirus budding [32], and to be involved in the control of synthesis of viral RNA of nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses [30]. Unexpectedly, our investigation with the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway has a negligible effect on the titer of infectious PRRSV progeny in MARC-145 cells (p > 0.05), as determined at both 36 and 48 h p.i. (Fig. 5A), but inhibition of this pathway significantly blocked virus-induced CPE formation. To our knowledge, similar results have not been documented for other viruses. Therefore, it will be worthwhile in the future to investigate how the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates CPE formation during PRRSV infection.",

FoxO1 and Bad were employed by the virus as downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Unlike other viruses for which the control of this pathway contributes significantly to virus replication, for PRRSV, it is not important for generation of infectious progeny, but this modulation changes the physiology of the host cell, as revealed by the significant alleviation of CPE. This finding may offer a new and important insight into the role of PI3K/Akt in virus infection, or even in viral pathogenesis.",
