For rural populations in tropical regions, such as Subsaharan Africa, bushmeat is a major source of protein (Fa et al. 2003), and also a vital source of financial income for households living in extreme poverty (de Merode et al. 2004). Hunting of wild animals is significantly increasing not only due to the continuous increase in the human population, but also as earlier impenetrable rainforests become accessible through the expansion of roads related to extractive industries such as logging (Wilkie et al. 1992; Laurance et al. 2006) and mining (Edwards et al. 2014). When tackling the species composition of bushmeat, most studies focus on large-bodied mammals and birds. However, since overexploitation depleted populations of the more sought birds and mammals (Nasi et al. 2011), large-bodied reptiles, such as snakes, monitors, crocodilians, turtles and tortoises, are also found in increasing numbers at bushmeat markets (Chifundera Kusamba et al. 2014).",

As a consequence, new zoonotic diseases are likely to emerge. Bats (Chiroptera), for instance, are important reservoirs of emerging viruses, including filoviruses (Changula et al. 2014), SARS coronavirus and others (Calisher et al. 2006). Recently, zoonotic parasites like Paragonimus westermani and Strongyloides fuelleborni have also caused emerging epidemics (Aka et al. 2008; Olsen et al. 2009). Among those infections, the reptile-borne pentastomiasis is an unusual and under-researched, neglected tropical disease in Africa, Asia and South America (Sulyok et al. 2014).",

Armillifer grandis and A. armillatus have recently been identified as more widespread human pathogens in rural tropical Africa than previously thought. Their typical intermediate hosts are rodents and small-bodied primates, while they utilize snakes as definitive (final) hosts (Tappe et al. 2015). Specifically, adult A. armillatus are presumed to occur in the respiratory tracts of African pythons (e.g., Python sebae and P. regius), while adult A. grandis inhabits the lungs and tracheae of large-bodied African \u2018puff adders\u2019 (e.g., Bitis gabonica and B. nasicornis) (Christoffersen and De Assis 2013). Unfortunately, host specificity data provided by early authors have limited values due to low sample sizes and the often unreliable identification of parasites. These snakes are among the most harvested reptile species sold for human consumption at Central and West African bushmeat markets (Chifundera Kusamba et al. 2014).\n",

In contrast, the highly symptomatic ocular pentastomiasis (when parasites reside in or around the eye) cases are rare, representing only the tip of the iceberg of the disease burden (Sulyok et al. 2014).

Snake body length and mass were measured when possible, or at least estimated if the snake was already decapitated. Subsequently, snakes were dissected on the spot, and the respiratory organs (and their surrounding tissues) were inspected for adult pentastomids that are well visible to the naked eye (Fig. 1). Parasites were extracted using forceps and placed in 97% ethanol for subsequent morphological examination. Specimens with 19 annulations were identified as A. armillatus, and those with 26\u201328 (most often 26) annulations as A. grandis (Pantchev and Tappe 2011).\n",

For the first time, we provide statistical description of the frequency distribution of these parasites within the populations of their definitive hosts. Not surprisingly, these distributions are characteristically left-biased (aggregated) as it is often the case in macroparasites (R\u00f3zsa et al. 2000).

However, our data show that A. grandis prefers vipers and most vipers indeed host A. grandis, whereas A. armillatus prefers to parasitize pythons and accordingly, most pythons host A. armillatus. Our identification of parasite species was based only on morphology (the number of ring-like annulations), a field method that a recent molecular study had confirmed (Tappe et al. 2016).

Consumption of snakes as bushmeat seems to be the general reason behind the emerging epidemics of human pentastomiasis. However, the precise way of parasite transmission is still not known. We suspect that infective eggs are likely transmitted to people (1) directly through eating uncooked snake meat, (2) through kitchen tools like pots and knives as fomites, (3) through recycling the water used to wash these tools (4) or by improper hand hygiene while handling snakes.

The specific gender-related food taboos of the Songye people, provided they are actually obeyed in practice, may offer the chance to deduce the route of infection by future gender-based prevalence studies.

There is a clear necessity of surveillance of parasite infections in bushmeat, and particularly in large-bodied vipers and pythons offered for human consumption to detect and prevent zoonotic diseases (Karesh and Noble 2009). In the short run, pictured brochures are needed to disseminate basic knowledge to local tribesmen about the role of snakes as sources of zoonotic threat and the necessary hygienic measures to avoid it.
