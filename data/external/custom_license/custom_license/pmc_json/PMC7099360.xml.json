            "text": "According to current knowledge, the mechanism of RNAi is initiated when long dsRNAs are processed by an RNase III-like protein known as Dicer. The protein Dicer typically contains an N-terminal RNA helicase domain, an RNA-binding so-called Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille (PAZ) domain, two RNase III domains and a dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD),[3] and its activity leads to the processing of the long dsRNA into 21\u201324 nucleotide double-stranded siRNAs with two base 3\u2032 overhangs and a 5\u2032 phosphate and 3\u2032 hydroxyl group. The resulting siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into the effector complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where the antisense or guide strand of the siRNA guides the RISC to recognize and cleave target messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences[2] upon adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent unwinding of the double-stranded siRNA molecule through an RNA helicase activity.[4] The catalytic activity of RISC, which leads to mRNA degradation, is mediated by the endonuclease Argonaute 2 (AGO2).[5,6] AGO2 belongs to the highly conserved Argonaute family of proteins. Argonaute proteins are \u223c100 kDa highly basic proteins that contain two common domains, namely the PIWI and PAZ domains.[7] The PIWI domain is crucial for the interaction with Dicer and contains the nuclease activity responsible for the cleavage of mRNAs.[6] AGO2 uses one strand of the siRNA duplex as a guide to find mRNAs containing complementary sequences, and cleaves the phosphodiester backbone between bases 10 and 11 relative to the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand.[2] An important step during the activation of RISC is the cleavage of the sense or passenger strand by AGO2, removing this strand from the complex.[8] Crystallography studies analyzing the interaction between the siRNA guide strand and the PIWI domain reveal that it is only nucleotides 2\u20138 that constitute a \u2018seed sequence\u2019 that directs target mRNA recognition by RISC.[9] Once the mRNA has been cleaved, and because of the presence of unprotected RNA ends in the fragments, the mRNA is further cleaved and degraded by intracellular nucleases and is no longer translated into proteins,[10] while the RISC is recycled for subsequent rounds.[11] This constitutes a catalytic process leading to the selective reduction of specific mRNA molecules and of the corresponding proteins. It is possible to exploit this native mechanism for gene silencing with the purpose of regulating any gene(s) of choice by directly delivering siRNA effectors into the cells or tissues, where they will activate RISC and produce a potent and specific silencing of the targeted mRNA.",

One of these mechanisms is that mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which are functional, naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs that require only partial complementary targets to bind to their target mRNAs through their 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032 UTRs).[12,13] miRNAs act as guide sequences to regulate the expression of multiple genes that are often functionally related. Furthermore, the translation of many mRNAs is regulated by multiple different miRNAs. They are critical factors in coordinating the development, differentiation, and functions of cells and tissues and it is estimated that there are hundreds of these molecules in humans. There are approximately 500 miRNAs that have been identified in the human genome and they are believed to regulate the expression of up to 30% of all human genes by preventing translation of mRNAs into proteins.",

            "text": "miRNAs arise from class II RNA polymerase transcripts, termed primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), that vary in length from a few hundred bases up to tens of kilobases and have significant secondary structures. These pri-miRNAs are then recognized by the microprocessor complex, consisting of the proteins Drosha and DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8), which cleaves the pri-miRNA into \u223c70 nucleotide hairpin containing a 2-nucleotide overhang on its 3\u2032 end.[14] This precursor (pre)-miRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the protein exportin 5 (Exp5),[15] where it is processed by a Dicer-containing complex to \u223c21\u201325 nucleotide imperfect dsRNA duplexes that constitute the mature miRNAs.[16,17] Once processed by this Dicer complex, consisting of Dicer, the HIV transactivating response RNA-binding protein TRBP,[18] and the protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase, PACT,[19,20] the miRNA duplex is assembled into the RISC;[21] however, because the miRNA duplexes are almost always asymmetric and not completely complementary, they do not have an antisense stretch of nucleotides as happens with siRNAs. The mechanism of selection of one strand above the other is not completely clear, but once one strand has been loaded into the RISC, imperfect sequence complementarity between both strands of miRNA might prevent AGO2 from cleaving the passenger strand,[21] which is instead unwound and discarded. The remaining strand then guides the RISC to the 3\u2032 UTRs of the mRNAs, leading to the repression of protein expression by a number of mechanisms,[22,23] often accompanied by mRNA degradation in cytoplasmic compartments known as processing bodies or P-bodies.[24] When miRNAs share complete sequence complementarity with their target sequence they instead direct their cleavage by RISC activity.[25] A specific stretch of the mature miRNA, which includes the first 2\u20138 nucleotides from its 5\u2032 end,[26] must have complete complementarity with the target in order to obtain effective silencing, whereas mismatched nucleotides in the 3#x2032; end are better tolerated.",

The double-stranded region of shRNAs is formed though a hairpin structure and intramolecular hybridization that resembles that of miRNA precursors.[27,28] These shRNAs molecules are recognized by Dicer, leading to the formation of siRNAs homologous to the target mRNA. The main difference with siRNAs is that while these mediate only transient silencing because their concentrations in the cytoplasm are diluted over time with successive cell divisions, shRNAs mediate a very potent and stable silencing effect for as long as their transcription takes place. On the other hand, the obvious problems with this approach are the same ones encountered with gene therapy and those related to the expression of long exogenous RNAs. shRNAs also enter the endogenous silencing pathway at an earlier stage than siRNAs, having a higher chance of saturating the natural miRNA natural pathways.[29] Recent studies have sought to address this issue by showing that it is possible to avoid at least some of the safety concerns by seeking localized expression of shRNAs using vectors harboring tissue-specific polymerase II promoters with improved tolerability.[30] Nevertheless, most current efforts rather lean towards the therapeutic use of synthetic siRNAs. All the mechanisms of action described above for siRNAs, miRNAs, and shRNAs are summarized, in figure 1.\n\n",

            "text": "It is well documented that dsRNAs longer than 30 nucleotides can trigger potent immune responses. However, siRNAs largely circumvent this problem as they seem to be too small to induce cellular toxicity. Nevertheless, this does not always appear to be true. Two pathways can lead to the activation of immune responses: one involves recognition by cytosolic RNA-binding proteins such as the serine/threonine protein kinase R (PKR), the helicase retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5),[33] and the other includes three members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8).[34] Detection of RNA molecules can also be triggered in a sequence-specific manner and recognition seems to be cell specific.[35,36] The work to identify immunostimulatory motifs and the mechanisms of interferon responses to foreign pathogens and nucleic acids can be of great relevance in the design of synthetic siRNAs so that unwanted activation of the immune system can be prevented. For example, plasmacytoid dendritic cells can be activated via their endosomal TLRs by a specific GU-rich region, so called \u2018danger motifs\u2019, such as 5\u2032-UGUGU-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GUCCUUCAA-3\u2032.[34,37,38] This is reminiscent of the immunostimulatory cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs in anti-sense oligonucleotides (ODNs) that give \u2018danger signals\u2019 to the cells via their TLR9 receptors. Therefore, even though such warning signals can be beneficial under certain situations, they should be avoided in order to achieve safe therapeutic use of RNAi. It has also been shown that in vitro T7-transcribed siRNAs potently induce interferon responses due to the presence of a 5\u2032 triphosphate moiety.[39] Several reports have shown that the presence of 2\u2032-O-methyl, 2\u2032-F and phosphoro-thioate backbone modifications within the siRNAs can be used to avoid their binding to TLRs and prevent cytokine induction while maintaining silencing activity.[34,40,41]",

The rules defining miRNA targets are still not fully understood, so it is difficult to predict when any given siRNA will elicit off-target silencing. Very limited sequence homology at the \u2032 end UTRs of the off-target genes might suffice to induce gene silencing. Target specificity of miRNA depends on a 7-nucleotide region called the \u2018seed region\u2019 or \u2018seed sequence\u2019, comprising nucleotides 2\u20138 from the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand of the miRNA.[46] Thus, such small sequence homology is enough to trigger off-target effects (OTEs) and the chances of finding 7-nucleotide complementary regions in the entire human transcriptome are far greater than would have been desirable.",

Snove and Holen[48] performed an independent investigation of 360 published siRNA sequences and found that almost 75% of these oligonucleotides had the potential to trigger unwanted OTEs. They suggested that use of inappropriate programs, such as basic local alignment and search tools (BLAST), to design effective oligonucleotides leads to abundant OTEs because a precise homologous stretch of six or seven base pairs is necessary for detection through BLAST. This would eliminate the detection of very closely related sequences of 5\u201310 base pairs that could have one or two mismatches, enough to allow hybridization to off-target sequences. Additionally, nonspecific OTEs are not limited to the guide strand and can also be triggered by the passenger strand if it incorporates into RISC and binds to mRNAs bearing total or partial sequence homology.[43] RISC incorporation favors the strand with the least tightly bound 5\u2032 end, such that it becomes the active strand. Strand selection can in fact be manipulated by designing siRNAs destabilized at the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand, e.g. by making a single nucleotide substitution at the end of the duplex to alter the relative binding of the ends, thereby promoting incorporation of this strand and not the passenger into RISC and minimizing potential OTEs.[49\u201351] A comparison of the effectiveness of siRNAs using different delivery methods has also shown that many OTEs largely depend on the lipid-based transfection reagent more than on the siRNA itself.[52]",

This may be the case with RNAi-based drugs. shRNAs and siRNAs are very similar to miRNA precursors before and after Dicer processing, respectively, and rely on endogenous miRNA machinery to achieve target silencing. Therefore, miRNA pathways might become saturated by high doses of exogenous RNAs. One of the ways adenoviruses avoid potential host RNAi antiviral activity is by expressing large quantities of a non-coding RNA stem-loop that interferes with transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by binding to the nuclear karyopherin Exp5, thereby inhibiting transport and subsequent processing of cellular pre-miRNAs.[53] Similar to this process, some reports have described that in vivo adeno-associated virus-encoded overexpression of liver-directed shRNAs can saturate Exp5. This results in inhibition of endogenous pre-miRNA nuclear export and, ultimately, causes death.[29] Strong expression of shRNAs has also been shown to induce cytotoxicity in primary lymphocytes, whereas the same shRNA expressed using a weaker promoter presents no toxic effects[54] and robust levels of antisense RNAs emerging from shRNA expression systems cause toxicity in the mouse brain, regardless of the sequence.[55] The export function mediated by Exp5 is not required for the activity of synthetic siRNAs;[56] however, a recent report has shown that synthetic siRNAs and expressed shRNAs compete against each other and with endogenous miRNAs for transport and incorporation into RISC and that TRBP is one of the sensors for selection and incorporation of the guide sequence of interfering RNAs.[57]",

In general, enrichment in adenosines and uracils along the first 6\u20137 base pairs of the sequence, and consequently, weak hydrogen bonding, allows the RISC to easily unravel the double-stranded duplex and load the guide strand.[62]",

This can be achieved using gene therapy approaches in which a short hairpin RNA expression cassette is stably integrated into the host cell genome or expressed episomally. Retroviral, adenoviral and adeno-associated and herpes viral shRNA delivery systems have been successfully used to silence genes both in vitro and in vivo. Stable integration can be mediated by lentivirus-based vectors that are well suited for these applications since they are able to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells.[68] Singer and colleagues[69] demonstrated how intracranially injected lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs targeting \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) significantly reduced amyloid production, the main cause of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More transient expression without genome integration can be provided by adenoviruses, resulting in short-term gene silencing. Adeno-associated viruses have been used for the delivery of specific siRNAs targeting mutant ataxin-1 in a spinocerebellar ataxia-1 (SCA1) mouse model, showing that reduction of the expression of ataxin-1 could improve motor coordination and restore cerebellar morphology.[70] Sabbioni and co-workers[71] use herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1)-based vectors for siRNA delivery into mammalian cells. Using human polyomavirus BK (BKV)-transformed cells as a model system, the ability of amplicon vectors to inhibit the expression of BKV-T-antigen has been demonstrated. The use of these amplicon vectors is highly efficient for the delivery of siRNA molecules and their ability to deliver multiple copies may constitute a useful tool in the development of novel therapies. Suckau and colleagues[72] used a rat model of transaortic banding to demonstrate how an RNAi-based therapy can be used to rescue heart failure and restore cardiac function. After intravenous injection of an adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV9-shPLB) targeting phospholamban, a key regulator of cardiac Ca2+ homeostasis, cardiac phospholamban protein was reduced to 25%. Suppression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase was rescued in the heart failure groups. Moreover, rAAV9-shPLB displayed high affinity for the myocardium, low affinity for the liver and other organs and no hepatotoxicity or miRNA deregulation.",

Different groups demonstrated that siRNA injected either intravitreally or subretinally into monkey and rat eyes efficiently silenced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and accordingly reduced ocular neovascularization.[82,83] Based on these results, anti-VEGF siRNAs have been one of the first to be tested in a clinical setting. In general, the advantages of local administration include the fact that siRNAs might require only a simple formulation and, therefore, be easier to produce and administer. Additionally, site-specific delivery might facilitate a localized effect and is likely to require a lower dose of the siRNAs for them to carry out their therapeutic function, exerting minimal systemic effects and reducing the risks of OTEs. Thus, whenever possible, local delivery of siRNAs is likely to be the most cost-efficient strategy in vivo.",

The cholesterol-siRNA conjugate could induce intracellular RNAi without any significant loss of gene silencing activity compared with the unconjugated version. In addition, the conjugate exhibited significantly higher cellular transfer efficiency in cultured cells without the aid of any transfectant agent. Significant silencing of APOB gene, which encodes a protein essential for cholesterol metabolism, was observed in the liver and jejunum after intravenous administration of the cholesterol-siRNA conjugate in vivo. Silencing of the APOB gene resulted in decreased plasma ApoB protein levels and, consequently, in a reduction in total cholesterol levels. Conjugation to cholesterol also improved siRNA pharmacokinetic behavior in vivo: conjugates showed an elimination half-life (t\u00bd) of 95 minutes and plasma clearance (CL) of 0.5mL/min, whereas unconjugated siRNAs had a t\u00bd of 6 minutes and a CL of 17.6mL/min.[84] Other studies have also shown that conjugation of nucleic acids with cholesterol enhances cellular uptake in human liver cells without the use of any transfection reagent in vitro[85,86] and good hepatic deposition after systemic administration in vivo.[86]",

At a 1:10 ratio of negative nucleic acid to positive peptide charges, a decrease in luciferase activity of about 80% was found in HeLa or Cos-7 cells. The investigators showed that cell entry is independent of the endosomal pathway and that the NLS of the MPG peptide is involved both in electrostatic interactions with the nucleic acid and in nuclear targeting.[96] Davidson and co-workers[97] showed a remarkably strong RNAi effect in primary neuronal cells using a penetratin-coupled siRNA against several endogenous proteins.

The siRNA found in PEG-siRNA conjugates is much more stable than its naked counterpart when incubated in the presence of 50% serum, lasting up to 16 hours without a significant loss of integrity.[98] The PEG-siRNA/polyethylenimine (PEI) PEC micelles have been used for local and systemic treatment of tumors in animal models.

            "text": "Initially introduced as DNA transfection reagents, many cationic liposomes have been tested for in vitro and in vivo transfection of nucleic acids. The flexibility in the design of cationic lipid structures and liposome composition, combined with the diversity of methods for their preparation and in vivo efficiency, have promoted the notion that cationic lipids can be efficiently used for human gene transfer. Nucleic acids, including siRNAs, are able to electrostatically interact with cationic liposome-forming particles. However, in contrast to large DNA plasmid molecules, the considerably smaller siRNAs cannot condense into particles of nanomeric dimensions.[99] Additionally, electrostatic interactions between siRNAs and cationic liposomes pose two potential problems: (i) a relatively uncontrolled interaction process, leading to lipid-siRNA complexes of excessive size and poor stability; and (ii) incomplete encapsulation of the siRNA molecules, thereby exposing the siRNAs to potential enzymatic or physical degradation.[88] Several liposomal systems have been developed over the years. Zhang and colleagues[100] successfully delivered siRNAs into lung tumor cells by loading siRNAs into liposomes bearing arginine octamer (R8) attached to the liposome surface. The R8 liposomes containing siRNAs showed high stability and protection of incorporated siRNA, achieving very high transfection efficiency in lung tumor cells. Another new liposomal system was able to deliver siRNA into different cell lines (HeLa and human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVEC]) at very low concentrations. These siRNA-containing liposomes were able to silence protein kinase 3 (PKN3) expression in a concentration-dependent manner and improve the cellular uptake of siRNAs escaping from the endosomal/lysosomal pathways.[101] Another example of liposomes used for delivery are stable nucleic acid lipids particles (SNALPs). In an in vivo mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, stabilized siRNAs incorporated into specialized liposomes to form SNALPs had a longer t\u00bd in plasma and liver compared with unformulated siRNAs, and when injected into mice, were associated with a reduction in serum HBV DNA. This effect was dose-dependent and persisted for 1 week after dosing. Likewise, treatment of guinea pigs with a pool of SNALP-formulated siRNAs targeting polymerase (L) gene of Zaire species of ebola virus (EBOV) completely protected the animals from death when administered shortly before EBOV challenge.[67]",

The core molecule is referred to as \u2018generation 0\u2019 and each successive repeat unit along all branches forms the next generation, i.e. \u2018generation 1\u2019, \u2018generation 2\u2019, and so on until the terminating generation. Successive branches are created using a stepwise synthesis that allows particle size to be precisely controlled and, with each step of branch synthesis, the number of branches increases exponentially, causing an increase in polymer density.[102] This pattern creates a physically protected void within the macro-molecule, which has chemical properties that differ from those of the surface and that can be exploited to host nucleic acids. The most well studied molecules are those based on ethylene diamine or ammonia cores with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrites or those based on butylenediamide cores and poly-propylenemine dendrites. Solubility of PAMAM dendrimers can be enhanced by partial acetylation of the reactive amino groups, which can then be conjugated with various targeting entities, such as folic acid to target receptors on specific cancer cells.[103] Although PAMAM dendrimers have been largely applied for delivery of plasmids and ODNs[104,105] and some studies have reported the use of monoclonal antibody-targeted dendrimers to target specific cells,[106] the latter strategy has not yet been shown to be effective for siRNA delivery. Kang and co-workers[107] reported the use of PAMAM dendrimers for delivery of siRNAs targeting multidrug resistance 1 protein (MDR-1) in NIH-3T3 MDR cells, but this strategy was not effective.",

The densely cationic nature of pure PEI can cause the polymer to be cytotoxic. Linear PEI usually shows higher transfection efficiencies and lower cytotoxicities than branched PEI. Grzelinski and colleagues[109] showed that the complexation of unmodified siRNAs with PEI leads to the formation of structures that condense around and completely cover siRNAs. These investigators reported that delivery of siRNAs against the growth factor pleiotropin complexed with PEI was able to generate antitumoral effects in an ortothopic mouse glioblastoma model with U87 cells growing intracranially. Urban-Klein and co-workers[108] showed that non-covalent complexation of synthetic siRNAs with low-molecular-weight PEI efficiently stabilizes siRNA and delivers it into cells where it can display full bioactivity at nontoxic concentrations. PEI polymers can be complexed to other molecules such as PEG and peptides, contributing to the PEI complex stabilization. Kim and collaborators[110] conjugated a prostate cancer-binding peptide with PEI via a PEG linker to deliver a VEGF small interfering molecule to human prostate carcinoma (PC)-3 cells. They reported an enhanced gene-silencing activity that was maintained even under serum conditions. Another example is the anti-VEGF siRNA/PEI-hyaluronic acid (HA) that achieved inhibition of tumor growth using the HA receptor-mediated endocytosis in tumor cells in vivo. These complexes can be successfully applied as specific antiangiogenic therapeutics for the treatment of diseases in tissues with HA receptors, such as liver and kidney.[111]",

Cyclodextrin-containing polycations (CDP) functionalized with transferrin to achieve preferential uptake into transferrin receptor-expressing tumor cells were employed in a murine model of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, targeting the Ewing\u2019s sarcoma-Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) gene product.[118] Similarly, a tumor growth reduction in Neuro2A tumor xenografts was reported after targeting of ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 (RRM2). Non-targeted nanoparticles were significantly less efficient upon intravenous injection compared with their funtionalized counterparts.[67,119] Recently published results have shown the first targeted delivery of synthetic siRNA in humans via a self-assembling cyclodextrin-based nanoparticle.[120] This study reported targeted in vivo delivery of a siRNA against RRM2, reducing the proliferative activity of a broad spectrum of human, mouse, rat, and monkey cancer types. Another RRM2 targeted nanoparticle formulation is CALAA-01, which in addition to the specific siRNA contains CDPs, PEG as a steric stabilization agent and transferrin. This four-component formulation is self-assembled into nanoparticles and administered intravenously to patients, in whom the nanoparticles circulate and localize to the tumors. The CDP contains organic groups that are protonated around pH = 6. This chemical-sensing mechanism triggers a number of processes of escape mechanisms from endocytic vesicles and releases the nucleic acid into the cytoplasm. Each of the components of the formulation is small enough to be cleared from the body via the kidney after the nanoparticle has disassembled into its individual parts. CALAA-01 was used to treat the first patients in a phase I clinical trial in May 2008. The trial was a safety study treating adults with solid tumors who were refractory to standard-of-care therapies.[120]",

            "text": "An important consideration to take into account for the therapeutic application of RNAi is the dosage of siRNA needed to achieve efficient silencing. An important disadvantage of systemic delivery systems is the large amount of siRNA that needs to be administrated to achieve efficient in vivo gene silencing at the target site. Therefore, strategies that would facilitate cell-type-specific delivery could allow a reduction of the amount of siRNA needed and/or the number of doses to be administered. Selective ligands that bind cell-specific receptors expressed by target cells can be conjugated to polymers and cationic lipids in order to promote specific cell uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis. This ligand-targeted delivery can be accomplished by direct attachment of the ligand to the siRNA moiety or by incorporation into the siRNA complexing formulation.[121] Several groups have exploited this specific delivery strategy. Schiffelers and collaborators[122] developed a tumor-selective delivery system where siRNA was complexed with PEGylated PEI and an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide was attached to the distal end of the PEG to target integrins expressed on the tumor neovasculature. This PEG-PEI-RGD system was used to deliver siRNAs inhibiting VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2), improving serum stability compared with unformulated siRNAs. Alternatively, Kim and co-workers[123] developed an approach by which siRNAs silencing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were complexed in PEI-PEG nanoparticles functionalized with folate. These nanoparticles were efficiently targeted to GFP-transfected human epidermal carcinoma cells overexpressing the folate receptor, which is abundant in many cancers and frequently used for targeted drug delivery. Mannose receptors and mannose-related receptors are highly expressed in dendritic cells and can be used to target these cells.[124] Transferrin receptor, typically upregulated on cancer cells, has also been used to target siRNA-cyclodextrin-containing polycations to transferrin receptor-expressing tumor cells in the lungs,[118] in gastric cancers[125] and in Ewing\u2019s sarcoma.[120] Alternatively, apta-mer-siRNA chimeric RNAs have been shown to be capable of cell-type-specific binding and delivery. McNamara and co-workers[126] have used an aptamer against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a cell surface receptor overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and tumor vascular endothelium, to downregulate polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) in a xenograft model of prostate cancer, inducing tumor growth inhibition and tumor regression.",

            "text": "HIV is the perfect example of a virus where immediate intervention is needed. Although significant success has been achieved with current antiviral therapies, their toxicity, complexity, cost, and, mostly, the appearance of drug resistances call for novel methods of intervention. It has been previously shown that silencing of the primary HIV receptor, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5), using siRNA results in the prevention of viral entry in human peripheral blood lympho-cytes[131] and primary hematopoietic cells.[132] Since then, most HIV viral transcripts have been effectively targeted using RNAi. However, targeting single sequences might be hampered by viral escape mechanisms in the same way as other failed monotherapies. Alternative strategies can be developed to avoid this genetic variability of HIV that can lead to a decreased therapeutic effect of the RNAi-based agents. Several versatile strategies involving multiple RNAi effectors or other gene expression inhibitors, called combinatorial RNAi (coRNAi), have been suggested, e.g. targeting a single region of viral DNA with multiple shRNAs expressed from individual promoters or as concatemers from one promoter. Other strategies have been targeting several regions of viral DNA, or both viral and host cellular DNA, with constructs expressing multiple shRNAs from one or separate promoters, expressing a long hairpin RNA from one promoter to silence numerous regions on a single target, or using coRNAi vectors co-expressing shRNAs with other nucleic acid-based inhibitors such as aptamers, ribozymes, trans-acting response element (TAR) decoys or therapeutic proteins.[133] An example of this kind of therapeutic strategy is Benitec\u2019s RNAi-based anti-HIV candidate.[68] Their product mediates DNA-directed RNAi (ddRNAi) using a lentiviral vector containing three genes for an shRNA targeting the tat-rev exon of HI, an anti-CCR5 ribozyme and a nucleolar-localizing TAR decoy. The therapy is delivered to mobilized hematopoietic stem cells. Once stem cells are circulating peripherally, they are collected, isolated and genetically modified with the lentiviral vector expressing the therapeutic products. Patients undergo full chemoablation, the regenerative cells of both the bone marrow and lymphoma cells are killed, and the treated stem cells are infused back into their bloodstream.",

New therapies for this infection are required every year, as these viruses change their viral determinants, giving rise to new virulent strains. Influenza A virus genome contains eight pieces of a segmented negative-sense RNA that codes for a total of 11 proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), neuroaminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), M1, M2, NS1, NS2, PA, PB1, PB1-F2 and PB2. Separation of the genome into these segments of viral RNA allows for re-assortment of viral RNA if more than one type of influenza virus infects the cells. The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces antigenic shifts. These changes allow the virus to infect new host species. The WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have expressed major concerns about the potential for this virus to mutate and to be responsible for a global pandemic. In humans, current vaccines and existing antiviral agents may not protect against newly emerging strains of influenza. Additionally, most flu vaccines are manufactured using chicken egg-based systems, which return low yields and are not amenable to scaling up and would be inadequate to fight a pandemic flu. Despite the high mutation and recombination rate, new chemically synthesized and easily scalable RNAi-based drugs could be designed, and multiple specific siRNAs targeting the most conserved regions required for viral replication could be used with antiviral activity across multiple strains of flu.[137] Several pharmaceutical companies, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Novartis, are collaborating to develop RNAi-based drugs targeting pandemic influenza infections.",

            "text": "In contrast to viruses, bacteria are not generally amenable to silencing by siRNA because they replicate mostly outside the host cell. However, it might still be possible to reduce morbidity and mortality from life-threatening bacterial infections by silencing host genes involved in aspects of the immune response that lead to adverse consequences. For example, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), lessened septic shock in mice treated with lipopolysacharide without jeopardizing the development of protective immunity.[142] Similarly, silencing host genes involved in mediation of bacterial invasion constitutes an interesting approach, e.g. silencing of caveolin-2 in murine lung epithelial cells inhibited invasion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (the major pulmonary pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients) by a lipid raft-dependent mechanism.[143] Mycobacterial infections are very difficult to treat because of their characteristic extremely hard cell wall and because they are naturally resistant to all antibacterials that work by destroying cell walls. Moreover, these pathogens elude sterilizing immunity by residing in the intracellular compartment of host cells, where they are protected from microbicidal attacks. Therefore, mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis are perfect candidates for treatment with RNAi-based therapeutics targeting host genes involved in mycobacterial invasion and growth inside the cells. The feasibility of using antisense therapies to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was proven in a study in which phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligodeoxyribonucleo-tides against glutamine synthetase transcripts were used.[144] This enzyme is associated with mycobacterial pathogenicity and with the formation of poly-L-glutamate/glutamine cell wall structures. Therefore, reducing the activity of this enzyme would have a great impact on bacterial replication. One recent study also showed inhibition of mycobacterial growth by reduction of the lysosomal enzyme \u03b2-hexosaminidase, which is a peptidoglycan hydrolase that facilitates mycobacterial-induced secretion of lysosomes at the macrophage plasma membrane.[145]",

            "text": "Protozoan parasites cause diseases of considerable medical and veterinary importance throughout Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The first report of RNAi in protozoan parasites was made in 1998 in Elisabetta Ullu\u2019s laboratory, where investigators found that dsRNA could induce sequence-specific mRNA degradation in Trypanosoma brucei.[146] Since then, RNAi has not only provided an invaluable tool for the study of T. brucei biology, but has additionally been tested as a therapeutic tool against T. brucei infection in vivo.[147,148] In a similar manner, T. congolense, the causative agent of Nagana disease in cattle, has also been shown to possess RNAi machinery.[149] The widespread resistance of common anti-malarial drugs is showing the needs of efficacious and innovative drugs and vaccines to fight Plasmodium parasites. During the latter part of the 20th century, there was an alarming increase in the number of cases of malaria reported in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and South America.[150] Chloroquine remains the gold standard treatment for malaria today. However, chloroquine resistance is a growing concern.[151] The causative agent of disease, Plasmodium falciparum, is a member of the intracellular protozoan phylum Apicomplexa. While RNA-like silencing has been reported in Plasmodium parasites, it remains controversial whether this phenomenon actually takes places in this organism. Kumar and co-workers[152] silenced a serine-threonine protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) in the parasite and showed that this enzyme plays an essential role in its life cycle, therefore offering a potential target for drug development. The downside to this approach is that PP1 is highly conserved throughout evolution. Therefore, toxic side effects can be expected unless specific variants of the protein are identified.[153] Another protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica causes human amebiasis. Once inside its host, the parasite invades the intestinal mucosa, causing dysentery, and travels through the circulatory system to the liver, where it causes development of abscesses. Vayssie and colleagues[154] achieved a specific and efficient silencing of \u03b3-tubulin mRNA, resulting in loss of the parasites\u2019 highly organized microtubule array. These results showed that \u03b3-tubulin is essential for microtubule nucleation and cycling of the parasite. Importantly, the protein primary amino acid sequence is homologous (46%) but not identical to its human homolog. Therefore, specific siRNAs may be developed to destroy the parasite\u2019s \u03b3-tubulin while leaving the host\u2019s counterpart untouched.[153]",

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by several different mutations, usually loss-of-function mutations. While >65% of DMD mutations are genomic deletions, a large number of exonic and intronic point mutations can cause the disease through aberrant splicing that abolishes the production of the functional protein. Dystrophin is positioned at the cytoplasmic side of the skeletal muscle sarcolemma, where it communicates signals between the extracellular matrix and the cellular contractile apparatus and stabilizes the cell membrane. A particularly revealing T\u2799 A substitution in exon 31 not only creates a premature termination codon, but also introduces an exonic splicing silencer that binds to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1), resulting in partial skipping.[158] Interestingly, mRNAs coding for one spectrin-like repeat but retaining the correct reading frame produce a partially functional protein, explaining why an individual harboring this mutation has a milder form of the disease.[159] Recent studies show a novel strategy for the treatment of this pathology employing steric block methylphosphorothioate antisense oligoribonucleotides (2\u2032-O-MeAO)[160] or morpholino oligomers conjugated with a dendrimeric octoguanidine (Vivo-Morpholinos).[161] These studies show how a local administration of a specific 2\u2032-O-MeAO in the dystrophic mouse model bearing a nonsense mutation or a Vivo-Morpholino systemic delivery, respectively, can effectively skip the mutated exon in the dystrophin gene, creating a shorter but in-frame transcript that is translated and leads to near-normal dystrophin expression in both skeletal and cardiac muscles.",

            "text": "A siRNA therapeutic approach has been applied in a number of contexts, including dominantly inherited and untreatable single-base mutations that lead to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In recent studies by Miller et al.,[162] amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau genes were chosen as candidate RNAi targets because of their central role in inherited and acquired forms of age-related dementia. AD is characterized by two major pathological hallmarks: senile plaques, which contain \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) derived from cleavage of APP, and neurofibrillary tangles, which contain filamentous tau proteins. It is well known that A\u03b2 production plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of all forms of AD, both in sporadic and inherited forms. Mutations in three genes known to cause familial AD, the genes encoding APP, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2, act dominantly to enhance the production of neurotoxic A\u03b2. The best studied AD mutations are the well characterized V337M mutation in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene and the Swedish double mutation in APPsw, in which two consecutive missense changes alter adjacent amino acids near the \u03b2-secretase cleavage site. Both have been used as target models for the design of allele-specific siRNAs. These siRNAs displayed successful and optimal allele-specific silencing against mutant tau and APP alleles.[162] Other single-nucleotide APP substitutions followed by amino acid substitutions (V717I, V717L, V717G) have been successfully targeted by a forked-siRNA (F-siRNA) approach, showing a high allele-specific gene silencing.[163] Mutations within and downstream of the alternatively spliced exon 10 of the MAPT gene encoding the tau protein, disrupting the 1 : 1 ratio of mRNAs that include or exclude this exon, have also been found. Exon 10 encodes the fourth of four repeated microtubule-binding domains (R) and disruption of the balance between the four repeat microtubule binding domain (4R-tau) and the three repeat microtubule binding domain (3R-tau) isoforms results in hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau proteins in neurofibrillary tangles that are hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Numerous mutations within and around MAPT exon 10 disrupt exonic and intronic splicing elements and cause the inherited neuropathological disorder frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTPD-17), demonstrating a direct relationship between aberrant expression due to alternative splicing disruption and neuropathology.[164] Miller and collaborators[165] successfully targeted four missense tau mutations that are responsible for FTPD-17. They employed a series of 21\u201324 nucleotide siRNAs designed against MAPT G272V, P301L, V337M and R406W mutations. Their results demonstrate how siRNAs can be engineered to silence expression of disease alleles differing from wild-type alleles by as little as a single nucleotide.",

This poly Q neurodegenerative disorder consists of at least nine diseases caused by CAG-repeat expansions that encode poly Q in the diseased protein. Poly Q expansion confers a dominant toxic property on the mutant protein that is associated with aberrant accumulation of the disease protein in neurons. To selectively inactivate the mutant allele, Miller and co-workers[165] took advantage of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MJD1 gene, a G to C transition immediately 3\u2032 to the CAG repeat (G987C). This SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with the disease-causing expansion, in most families segregating perfectly with the disease allele. Worldwide, 70% of disease chromosomes carry the C variant. To optimize differential suppression, siRNAs containing a centrally placed mismatch were designed. Central mismatches might discriminate between wild type and mutant alleles. Designed siRNAs placing the C of the SNP at position 10 (siC10) preceded by the final three triplets in the CAG repeat caused allele-specific suppression of the mutant protein.[165] Other RNAi approaches are showing promise for the treatment of several other neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington\u2019s disease, spinocerebellar ataxia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).[70,166]",

They are integral components of the genetic program that account for approximately 1\u20135% of the predicted transcripts in plants, worms and vertebrates, and their genes are localized in the introns of protein-coding genes or in the non-coding regions of the genome.[175] Interest in the role of miRNAs in the regulation of fundamental biological processes emerged rapidly following the discovery of the first miRNA, lin-14, in C. elegans a decade ago.[14] Distinct classes of miRNAs have been identified as key regulators of gene activation and suppression and they are highly specific for different tissues and developmental stages. Their functions have been appreciated in fundamental biological processes and cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, stem cell division, cell differentiation, stress response, apoptosis, immunity and transcriptional regulation. miRNA sequences are freely available to all through the web interface at http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/.[176] Actually, more than 8000 unique precursor and mature miRNAs have been identified and tabulated in the last miRNA base registry (release 12.0), including those in primates, rodents, birds, fish, worms, flies, plants, and viruses. Given the remarkable spectrum of biological pathways regulated, at least in part, by miRNAs, it is not surprising that abnormal miRNA signatures have been identified in disease states and that they may be valuable diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for disease. Furthermore, modulation of their activity may be of therapeutic benefit.[177] Recent use of synthetic analogs of these small RNA molecules, termed \u2018antag-omirs\u2019, has shown that genes of interest can be specifically targeted.",

Targeted degradation of the pri-miRNA transcripts in the nucleus with an RNase H-based antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) may be feasible and could constitute an interesting approach to inhibition of the production of multiple miRNAs from polycistronic pri-miRNA transcripts. RNAse H recognizes RNA-DNA duplexes, cleaving the RNA strand. siRNAs targeting the pri-miRNA are not likely to be effective, as siRNAs loaded into the RISC work primarily in the cytoplasm, where the pri-miRNA substrate is inaccessible. Alternatively, targeting the loop of the hairpin with an RNAase H ASO or siRNA may be possible. Indeed, several investigators have developed chemically engineered single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides as specific silencers of miRNA expression.[178,179] Krutzfeldt and co-workers[178] designed a cholesterol-conjugated single-stranded RNA molecule of 21\u201323 nucleotides complementary to the mature miRNA miR-122. They specifically silenced miR-122 in the liver, lungs, intestine, heart, skin, and bone marrow for more than a week after a single intravenous injection. As a result, up- and downregulation of hundreds of genes regulated by this miRNA was achieved. Davis and colleagues[179] extended these studies and highlighted how inhibition of miRNAs may be a possible therapeutic approach to the treatment of disease. They reported inhibition of miR-122 in both normal and high-fat-fed mice with a 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl (2\u2032-MOE) phosphorothioate modified antisense oligonucleotide for over 5 weeks. A significant reduction in hepatic sterol and fatty-acid synthesis rates and stimulation of hepatic fatty-acid oxidation was observed. These results suggest that miR-122 is a key regulator of cholesterol and fatty-acid metabolism and that it could be a therapeutic target for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.[179] Additionally, miR-122 contributes to the liver trophism of hepatitis C virus (HCV), accelerating binding of ribosomes to the viral RNA and thereby stimulating HCV translation. The involvement of miR-122 in HCV infection reveals how this viral factor is a potential target for RNAi and miRNA-based antiviral strategy and a possibly very important and novel therapy for HCV infection.[180] Several pharmaceutical companies, such as Regulus Therapeutics and Santaris Pharma, are developing a portfolio that is built on miRNA biology, with different miRNAs being targeted. This is evidence that a new kind of therapeutic field is emerging.",

This has broad implications in a clinical setting, as it would mean less frequent and/or lower doses, increasing patient compliance and decreasing the risk of adverse effects. siRNA are also natural cellular components, meaning cells should have the capacity to handle breakdown products, thus reducing their toxicity. Development of siRNA-based drugs also requires a shorter pharmacological development than that of conventional drugs (2\u20133 vs 4\u20136 years since proof of concept). siRNA compounds are made from strands of RNA that are manufactured by an RNA synthesizer, which greatly facilitates large-scale production.

Furthermore, even though any gene target could potentially be silenced using RNAi, in practice some genes are harder to target than others.

Fomivirsen is 21 nucleotides long and blocks the translation of viral mRNA by binding to a coding segment of a key CMV gene[183,184] that is administered as an intraocular injection. Antisense-mediated reduction of CMV proteins limits viral replication and inhibits adsorption of CMV to host cells, possibly by interaction with virions that may prevent adsorption or uncoating.[184,185] Its approval was important to antisense technology because it demonstrated that antisense drugs were effective in the treatment of local disease, that they could gain marketing approval by regulatory agencies around the world and that antisense drugs could be manufactured for commercial use. Although this drug changed the course of the disease, it can hardly be considered as commercially successful; it is offered only on a limited basis and sales have been extremely small as the number of HIV-infected individuals with CMV retinitis has declined with the appearance of new anti-HIV drugs (particularly protease inhibitors and combination treatment regimens). In addition, fomivirsen was shown to induce ocular inflammation as one of its major adverse effects.",

By targeting VEGFR-1, AGN-745 is designed to shut down activation of pathologic angiogenesis initiated by both VEGF and PGF. AGN-745 showed promising results in a phase 1 study that evaluated safety, tolerability and biological effect of single-ascending doses of AGN-745 in patients with AMD but Allergan has recently halted its development after the drug failed to meet a key efficacy endpoint in a phase II study. Although AGN-745 had initially held promise as the second RNAi drug to enter human testing, Allergan\u2019s decision to shelve the drug was not entirely unexpected in light of a recent report on the immunostimulatory nature of siRNAs[186] in which Jayakrishna Ambati\u2019s group showed that siRNAs at least 21 nucleotides in length, including AGN-745 and bevasiranib, suppressed neovascularization in mouse models of choroidal and dermal neovascularization, regardless of their sequence and targets, by triggering TLR3. However, even if AGN-745 or bevasiranib had proven effective in the clinic, the drugs were expected to face difficulties in attempts to share the AMD market with ranibizumab, given the strong safety and efficacy record of the latter. Indeed, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals had been developing its own VEGF-targeting siRNA drug, ALN-VEG01, but in fall 2005, the company dropped this program in light of the growing competition and decided to focus its efforts on RSV. Despite the loss of these three drug candidates for AMD, it appears that the target, rather than the indication, may have been the main issue. The real value of siRNAs is tackling targets that are not accessible through antibodies or small molecules; aiming at VEGF loses the real benefit of a siRNA approach.",

Unmodified naked siRNAs are rapidly degraded by endo- and exonucleases, resulting in short half-lives in vivo. As discussed in section 3, chemical modifications can be introduced in the RNA structure to enhance their biological stability without adversely affecting gene-silencing activity. However, good delivery systems are considered by many to be the most important remaining hurdles to the widespread therapeutic use of RNAi-based compounds. Selection and formulation of siRNAs with appropriate biocompatible and \u2018genocompatible\u2019 delivery systems is necessary to improve biological stability, targeted cell uptake and the pharmacokinetics of siRNAs in the organism.[188] Delivery of a drug to its target is as important as the efficacy of the drug itself. Failure to reach the target means failure to provide a therapeutic effect. Multifunctional delivery systems must be implemented to accomplish many tasks at the right place and at the right time. This integration of numerous functions in a delivery system successfully improves the therapeutic efficacy of siRNA-based drugs. Different design criteria must be considered. A complete delivery system must be adaptable, meaning it should be able to be modified in response to new mechanistic information, yielding bioactive molecules with easily modifiable surfaces, well defined structure and controllable sizes, thereby ensuring reproducible pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A good delivery system should also facilitate enhanced penetration and retention of siRNAs into specific cells and/or tissues. All of the delivery formulation components must be scalable at current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) conditions to facilitate large-scale production. It would also be necessary to develop non-immunostimulatory formulations that would enable repeated dosing if necessary. The formulation should additionally allow complete siRNA encapsulation to protect it from nucleases and recognition by TLRs on the cell surface. Moreover, all system components should be non-toxic and of such a size that would allow them to be cleared via the kidneys when the delivery systems are disassembled. Finally, an optimal delivery system should be achieved without compromising siRNA gene-silencing activity and specificity.",

Toxicity by oligonucleotide-based therapeutics can be induced through hydridization in two ways: excessive silencing of the intended gene product or reduction in expression of an unintended target by an antisense mechanism. The first type of toxicity can usually be avoided by selecting gene products that are not critical for survival and, in any case, can usually be easily detected at an early preclinical stage. The second type of toxicity is based on the low probability of the short RNAi sequence having a perfect or almost perfect match with more than one site in the genome. This eventuality can be minimized by performing complete BLAST searches for matches at other sites of the transcriptome and selecting unique sequences for the drug candidates. Nevertheless, the potential for unintended OTEs is probably greater than initially expected. As mentioned in section 2.2, in any siRNA two different strands are being administered, the sense and antisense, and both are potentially able to elicit unwanted effects. Additionally, since a perfect match is needed only in the so-called seed region, this allows for many more potential binding sites than if full complementarity was required. Therefore, these issues should be fully addressed with appropriate and complete toxicity studies.",

Some of these differences are due to the biological differences between species. For example, the pattern of TLR expression is different in rodents and humans (TLR9 is not expressed in human myeloid cells, TLR8 is lacking in mice, etc.). Additionally, in many cases there are also important species-dependent sequence differences, such that an oligonucleotide-based drug perfectly complementary to a human target may not hybridize with the corresponding mRNA in the animal species used in toxicity studies. In such cases, it might be appropriate to design and synthesize a surrogate oligonucleotide species-specific drug that is complementary to the mRNA for the target gene in the relevant animal species; however, ultimately, it will be critical to evaluate the immunological properties of candidate nucleic acid drugs in human primary immune cells. From what is known about the synthetic process and what is understood about synthesis-related impurities, we can predict that species-specific oligonucleotides will have similar chemistry manufacturing and controls as the sequence used in clinical trials. These animal sequence surrogates could be tested alongside the human sequence in toxicity studies to establish if there are biologic effects due to excessive silencing of the target gene and whether possible toxicities in rodents, such as immunostimulation, would be clinically relevant in humans. This concept has been part of the toxicity profiling of antisense drugs for the last decade.[190,191] There are cases when surrogate drugs are not needed simply because the target does not exist or has a completely different function in the species in which the toxicity studies will be performed. Such is also the case when the target mRNA is derived from an infectious agent not present in the host.",

If there are one or two mismatches near the termini of the siRNA or if these mismatches are not within the seed sequence, it is possible that there would still be a silencing effect, i.e. the degree of activity will largely depend on the placement of the mismatches and might largely be target specific. The general recommendation in such cases is to test whether slight differences in sequences are reflected in the activity of the compound. If this is not the case, we believe there would be no need to use surrogate sequences to characterize unwanted effects due to excessive pharmacologic effects. On the other hand, what if these few mismatches do have a great impact on the activity of the compound? Would it be preferable to change those few mismatches into the nucleotides that will confer full sequence complementarity and run the toxicology studies with such a surrogate only? Or should a completely new species-specific sequence be designed and analysed for toxicity effects in parallel with the human-specific one? The answer to these questions will have a broad impact on the candidate sequence choice because development process costs will increase dramatically if full toxicology studies are needed with the human-specific and surrogate sequences in parallel. The scope of the toxicity studies when surrogate molecules have been used includes pharmacology studies, subchronic and chronic studies, reproductive toxicity studies, immunotoxicity studies, and even carcinogenicity studies.[189] Short-term assays such as safety pharmacology studies are too short for there to be an antisense effect, so have not been widely performed in the case of surrogates, except when safety pharmacology endpoints are included in chronic and subchronic studies.",

The company has encountered a number of legal difficulties, primarily as a result of disputes in various jurisdictions by Nucleonics Inc. Benitec has a number of licensees, including a strategic cross-licensing with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (CombiMatrix Corporation).",

            "text": "Fig. 1: Mechanism of RNA interference in mammalian cells. RNA interference is an intracellular mechanism triggered through small RNAs that include small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). The siRNA pathway begins when double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are trimmed down by the Dicer complex into siRNAs. Alternatively, synthetic siRNAs can be introduced directly into the cell cytoplasm. These siRNAs are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where they are unwound. If the siRNA has perfect sequence complementarity, the Argonaute 2 the messenger RNA (mRNA) to direct mRNA cleavage. This cleavage is performed by the catalytic domain of AGO2. The miRNA pathway starts when primary miRNA (pri-miRNAs) are transcribed from RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoters, forming hairpin-shaped structures. These are processed by the Drosha-containing microprocessor complex, giving rise to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), which are also stem-like structures with a 2-nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang. Pre-miRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm by exportin 5 (Exp5), where they are processed by a Dicer containing complex to \u223c21\u201325 nucleotide (nt) imperfect dsRNA duplexes that constitute the mature miRNAs. Once the miRNA duplex is processed, the guide sequence is loaded into RISC and then mediates binding to the target sequence in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of cellular mRNAs. If the miRNA guide sequence is fully complementary to its target site, it triggers site-specific cleavage and degradation of the mRNA through the catalytic domain of AGO2. On the other hand, if the base pairing is incomplete but fully complementary in the seed region (nucleotides 2\u20138 of the miRNA), repression of protein expression occurs, often accompanied by mRNA degradation in cytoplasmic processing (P)-bodies. Mimicking the miRNA mechanism, synthetic DNA vector constructs or viral particles code for stable shRNAs, which are transcribed from an RNA polymerase II/III promoter and form hairpin-like structures. These shRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm by Exp5 and recognized by Dicer, leading to the formation of siRNAs homologous to the target mRNA and, subsequently, to mRNA degradation.
