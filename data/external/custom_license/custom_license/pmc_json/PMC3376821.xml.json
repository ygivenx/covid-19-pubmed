More than 725,000 trimmed reads were assembled by using de novo assembly and analyzed according to BLAST searches (Technical Appendix Figure 1 and Table 1) (6,7). Sequences were classified on the basis of the taxonomic origin of the best-hit sequence (6,7). An E (expect) value of 0.001 was used as cutoff value of significant virus hits.

A previous study found high prevalence of virus-neutralizing antibodies against a closely related calicivirus, Recovirus Tulane, in serum samples from animal caretakers (15). Larger epidemiologic studies using genetic and serologic screening will be necessary to provide more insight into the distribution and pathogenic potential of recoviruses in humans.",

Indicated are the poly(A)-tail (An); putative cleavage sites indicated by XX\u2193XX. The 5\u2032 end of the genome was not obtained. The bottom of the panel shows a schematic outline of the reverse transcription PCRs employed to amplify calicivirus Bangladesh/289/2007 sequences by using random amplification, degenerate PCR, and 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. The orientations and positions of the oligonucleotides on the calicivirus genome are depicted and sequences shown in Technical Appendix Table 2. B) Genome organization of caliciviruses in the genera Vesivirus, Nebovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, and Lagovirus and proposed genera Valovirus and Recovirus, for comparison with the new calicivirus Bangladesh/289/2007.
