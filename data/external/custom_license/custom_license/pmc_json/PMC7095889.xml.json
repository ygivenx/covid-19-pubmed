Earlier this year, a team led by Haagmans identified dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as the surface receptor employed by the MERS coronavirus to gain entry into host cells, including human ones3. Using crystallization techniques, George Gao and his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing on 7 July described the molecular basis of the binding between the virus and DPP4 (ref. 4). And also last month, a group led by Shibo Jiang published a study demonstrating the immunogenic potency of a 286\u2013amino acid stretch on the MERS coronavirus's binding domain5\u2014a first step toward an eventual MERS vaccine.",

The same NIAID team, led by Heinz Feldmann, showed in April that pneumonia-like symptoms develop in macaques infected with MERS within 24 hours of infection, resulting in a respiratory disease similar to, but less severe than, that found in people with MERS7. The macaque system is not as practical and widely applicable as a small-animal model, and not that many research groups are working with it. But the NIAID team, for one, is now moving ahead with drug tests in the monkeys. Specifically, the researchers are evaluating whether two antiviral compounds\u2014alpha-interferon and ribavirin, both of which are used to treat hepatitis and other infections\u2014can clear MERS coronavirus infections. Both drugs inhibit viral replication in monkey cell lines with synergistic effects when administered together, Feldmann and his colleagues have shown8.",
