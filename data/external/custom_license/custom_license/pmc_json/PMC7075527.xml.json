            "text": "Boronic acid derivatives have been proposed as low-toxicity agents for inhibiting the\nentry of various viruses.15,16 To test if such concepts can be extrapolated to human coronavirus\nHCoV-229E infections, boronic acid functional groups were chemically integrated onto\nCQDs-1 formed through hydrothermal carbonization of ethylenediamine/citric acid (Figure 2A). The approach consists of sealing the\norganic precursors in a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber and performing the formation of\nCQDs at elevated temperature under reduced pressure for 5 h. The pH value of the\nresulting CQDs suspensions was found to be 7.2 \u00b1 0.2 (n = 5). To\nremove larger precipitates, the as-obtained CQDs suspension was first centrifuged and\nthen dialyzed against water for 24 h with a final yield of CQDs of 40%. CQDs-1 exhibit\na spherical shape with an average diameter of 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 nm (Figure 2B). XPS analysis (Table 1) indicates the presence of C, O, and N. The C1s\nhigh-resolution XPS spectrum of CQDs-1 depicts three different carbon features: the\ngraphitic C=C at 283.4 eV, 284.9 eV (C\u2013H), and 286.4 eV (C\u2013O,\nC\u2013N) (Figure 2C). Analysis of the\nN1s high-resolution XPS shows the presence surface NH2 groups\n(399.9 eV) (Figure 2D). The Raman spectrum of\nthe CQD-1 (Figure 2E) displays the\ncharacteristic G band at 1570 cm\u20131 related to in-plane vibration of\nsp2 carbon, and the D band at 1350 cm\u20131 attributed to\ndisorder and defects. The ratio of the intensity of these bands\n(ID/IG), used to express the\nextent of sp2/sp3 hybridization of carbon atoms,17 is found to be 0.93 \u00b1 0.15 for all particles.18 XRD patterns indicate their crystalline nature (see Figure S1A) with a broad diffraction peak centered at 25.5\u00b0\ncorresponding to an interlayer spacing of 0.35 nm. This is larger than the spacing\nbetween (100) planes in bulk graphite (0.23 nm) due to the incorporation of functional\ngroups along the edges of the CQDs.19 The UV\u2212vis of CQDs-1\n(see Figure S1B) reveals an absorption maximum at \u223c242 nm attributed\nto \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition of C=C and a band at 344 nm due to\nn\u2212\u03c0* transition of C=O and C=N bonds.20,21 The fluorescence quantum yield\n(QY) is 0.33 as compared to that of quinine sulfate used as reference (QY, 0.54 in\n0.12 M H2SO4) (see Figure S1C). A wavelength-dependent fluorescence emission is observed\n(see Figure S1D) where upon increasing the excitation wavelength, the\nemission gradually shifts to the red region with an increase in fluorescence\nintensity. The phenomenon of excitation-dependent emission is typical for such\nnanostructures.5\u22127 The zeta potential\nand hydrodynamic size of the CQDs-1 are summarized in Table 1.",

These data reveal two important findings.\nFirst, it highlights that boronic acid functions, where the mode of action is the\nselective and reversible formation of tetravalent complexes with\ncis-diols and thus glycan units,24 are interacting\nwith HCoV-229E. CQDs-3 are in this context speculated to be pseudolectins, targeting the\nS protein of HCoV-229E via a lectin\u2013carbohydrate binding mechanism, similar to\nthat of the oligomannose-specific lectin Griffithsin.25 Thus, the\npresence of mannose is blocking the antiviral activity in favor of this mechanistic\nbehavior. The presence of some antiviral activity of the mannose saturated CQDs-3 might\nbe due to the presence of the triazole function on the particles\u2019 surface.\nIndeed, the control particles CQDs-4, bearing no boronic acid function but a triazole\nring, display some antiviral activity, even though largely decreased when compared to\nCQDs-3.",

Moreover, the inhibition activity of CQDs was\nstronger when the nanoparticles were added during the entry step, that is, 30 minutes\nbefore and after inoculation and during inoculation. These results agree with our\nhypothesis of an interaction of CQDs with HCoV-229E S protein, or an interaction of CQDs\nwith entry factors. Surprisingly, a strong inhibitory activity of CQDs was also observed\nwhen they were added after 5.5 h after the entry step, the replication step.

This suggests that, in addition to its major effect on HCoV-229E entry,\nCQDs can also affect the genomic replication of this virus.

The possibility to interfere with viral attachment to cells\nas well as viral replication to reduce viral infection and spreading is an appropriate\nantiviral approach. We presented here the antiviral performance of seven different CQDs with\ntheir main features summarized in Table 3. Three of\nthese CQDs (CQDs-3, -5, -6) were shown to interfere significantly with HCoV-229E-Luc\ninfection in a concentration-dependent manner, while CQDs-4 showed a very moderate antiviral\nactivity. The estimated EC50 value decreased considerably from CQDs-3, boronic\nacid-modified quantum dots, derived from ethylenediamine/citric acid as carbon precursors\n(EC50 = 52 \u00b1 8 \u03bcg mL\u20131) to 5.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcg\nmL\u20131 in the case of CQDs-6. While the presence of boronic acid functions\nproved to be vital for covering CQDs-3 with antiviral activity, CQDs-5 and CQDS-6 did not\ncarry a substantial amount of boronic acid functions, as revealed by 11B NMR and\nvalidated by mannose addition experiments. These findings reveal the complex nature of\nidentifying viral inhibitors for human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E-Luc. Mechanistic\nstudies suggest that the particles are acting at the early state of virus infection through\nthe inhibition of entry that could be due to inhibition of protein S-receptor interaction\nwith the host cell membrane. All different particles interfere in addition with the viral\nreplication step, something less common. These results are extremely encouraging to replace\ncurrently used antiviral agents such a ribavirin and IFN known to have major side effects\nsuch as confusion, short-term memory loss, deficits in executive functions, as well as\nextrapyramidal effects. Further experimental confirmations are required if this approach can\nbe extrapolated to other coronaviruses, notably to the clinically relevant MERS-CoV, to\nvalidate the potential of these nanostructures as alternative anti-MERS therapeutics and\napproaches to confront this severe and life-threatening disease.
