            "text": "Public health infectious disease surveillance employs two strategies to detect cases and outbreaks of communicable diseases: laboratory-based surveillance and syndromic surveillance, which relies on non-laboratory data. Although syndromic surveillance is sometimes the only viable option for population-level monitoring of certain diseases, laboratory-based surveillance is usually more accurate, as the definitive diagnosis of most infectious diseases requires laboratory confirmation. A range of methods are available in public health laboratories: traditional assays include microscopy and culture-based analyses, as well as immunoassays that detect antigens from the pathogen or immune responses from the host; modern techniques include nucleic acid amplification tests. Nevertheless, many samples entering a public health laboratory remain undiagnosed despite being subjected to a battery of conventional laboratory tests.",

Presuming a pathogenic agent is present in the sample, the undetected disease agents in these cases may simply be known species that are not targeted by a laboratory\u2019s testing algorithm or they may be truly novel pathogens. The emergence of novel microorganisms challenges laboratory surveillance efforts, which must constantly evolve to identify new pathogens, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3,4] and H7N9 influenza [5]. Over 60% of these emerging pathogens are zoonotic in origin [6], with their entry into human populations facilitated by both human encroachment into previously uninhabited regions and vector redistribution resulting from habitat loss and climate change [7].",

Metagenomics, the culture-independent sequencing and analysis of all nucleic acids recovered from a sample, has the potential to revolutionize the detection of both known and novel microorganisms. Its holistic nature means that instead of performing multiple targeted assays, each looking for a specific pathogen, laboratories can use a single sequencing-based test that is capable of identifying most, if not all, microorganisms in a sample without the need for culture. Furthermore, the use of sequencing technology permits the assembly of the complete, or near-complete, genomes of pathogens from a sample. These sequence data can then be used to predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes, to identify virulence genes and to inform enhanced outbreak investigations [8].",

Computational analyses are used to identify conserved regions in the genomes of known species or genus members; these regions are chosen as primer or probe targets. In multiplexed assays, regions from multiple targets can be selected to detect the most common pathogens known to be associated with a clinical syndrome. Consensus PCR using degenerate primers has also been used successfully to identify a large variety of bacteria and viruses from various hosts and environments, including the recently emerged MERS-CoV [23].",

By designing PCR primers to amplify regions within these genes, researchers generate PCR products called amplicons. The DNA sequences of these amplicons are specific to different microbial species, allowing the identification of the various members of the microbial community. Using next-generation-based \u2018deep sequencing\u2019, the many different amplicons in a sample can all be sequenced.

Extracted material is sequenced on a next-generation sequencing platform, and the resulting reads compared to a reference database. These databases are much larger than those used in DAS, as they must contain all known sequences from all organisms rather than a set of sequences from a single gene family. Although this makes the analytical part of a shotgun study computationally intensive, the advantages over DAS are numerous. Shotgun methods are less biased and generate data that better reflect the sample\u2019s true population structure, as recently shown by the HMP team [39]. Furthermore, only shotgun methods can interrogate the accessory genome, that is, the non-core set of genes that often differentiate pathogenic bacteria within a genus or species from closely related commensal strains. For example, Escherichia coli strains K12 and O157:H7 are identical by 16S rRNA DAS analysis, yet the latter strain is considerably more virulent [13].",

They can also be used to calculate the microbial genotype by using in silico techniques in concert with epidemiological information to identify person-to-person transmission events and outbreak or epidemic dynamics [74,79]. In the case of functional profiling, metagenomics offers the significant advantage of replacing multiple tests with a single analysis (Figure 2), although it must be noted that it is not always possible to detect which species within a metagenome a particular gene comes from [78].",

Two recent studies investigating metagenomic associations with type 2 diabetes highlight such difficulties. The studies used two populations, one of mixed gender from China and the other of elderly European females. Although both populations demonstrated an association between butyrate-producing bacteria and type 2 diabetes, other discriminatory characteristics differed between the two groups; when the classification generated from one sample set was used on the other, its predictive power was much reduced [14,84,85].",

Discovering a novel pathogen or an unusual collection of microorganisms within a clinical sample is, however, merely the first step in the process of determining its role in a disease. The identification of a microbial species through its genome alone does not establish causation. In fact, many of the pathogens that have been discovered through this approach fail to meet Koch\u2019s postulates for causality as it is sometimes not possible to culture the pathogen or to identify a suitable animal model for further studies [99]. Confronted with these challenges, several groups have suggested alternative Koch\u2019s postulates. After the introduction of PCR- and DNA-based identification methods, Fredericks and Relman [99] suggested modified postulates, but even these might not be adequate for recognizing complex diseases in which a combination of multiple microorganisms and/or environmental factors are required to cause disease. More recently, a set of postulates that are applicable to metagenomics has been suggested [96]; but even these require inoculation into a host, which may not be possible for all pathogens.",

For ubiquitous viruses (for example, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6 and torque teno virus) or for diseases for which additional variables such as host genetics and environmental factors play a significant role, however, proof of causality can be exceedingly difficult [14,15]. In such circumstances, care must be taken not to create spurious links between infectious agents and disease, since such false associations could lead to potentially dangerous treatments and might be harder to disprove than to generate initially [75]. For other complex diseases with a polymicrobial etiology, metagenomics can provide a foundation for more targeted quantitative analyses on larger cohorts in order to differentiate between the microorganism(s) driving the disease and non-pathogenic commensals [101].",

Research findings are more likely to be true when the prior probability of the finding is high [102]; thus, for unusual metagenomics results, additional lines of evidence are required for confirmation. For example, in a study of nasopharyngeal swabs taken from individuals in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, one sample contained a pair of reads that mapped with 97% nucleotide identity to Ebola virus, but after further investigation, this finding was concluded to be contamination [13]. Since shotgun metagenomics is a relatively new field, all the possible causes of contamination are not yet known, but they can include experimental reagents, DNA extraction columns [103,104], cross-contamination during sample processing, and carry-over between sequencing runs [97]. Despite these caveats, all new discoveries must initially arise from novel and unexpected findings, but they must be followed up with the appropriate control samples and experiments.",

As metagenomic approaches mature and the methods are clinically validated, metagenomics-based approaches might become front-line diagnostic tests for infectious diseases in the public health setting. When faced with an unknown or complex infectious disease, multiple conventional diagnostic tests are often used, potentially leading to unnecessary costs and delays in diagnosis. Instead, metagenomics might be used as a single comprehensive screening test for potential pathogens, both known and novel, as well as to assess the state of an individual\u2019s microbiome (Figure 2). Additional targeted diagnostic tests could then be used to further understand the clinical disease and determine management options.",

Similar procedures could also be applied to environmental microbiomes in healthcare settings; for example, urinary catheters could be treated with prebiotics to reduce the risk of colonization by harmful bacteria [105]. In fact, it has been suggested that metagenomic investigations of the microbiome could become so standard that DNA sequencers could be used in household toilets to monitor changes in stool microbiome content, which could then be used to guide interventions to maintain health [106].",

Thus, although metagenomics might one day be used for screening clinical samples, it is currently best positioned as a complementary technique to be used alongside culture and other traditional methods. The greatest value of metagenomics is in clinical cases where conventional techniques fail to find a microbial cause. Even then, metagenomics requires skilled scientists to perform the experiments and to analyze the data, and thus, to date it has been exercised primarily in the realm of academic research rather than at the frontlines of public health. To be considered a bona fide clinical test for pathogen detection in a public health laboratory, standard metagenomic protocols are necessary both for testing and analyzing samples and for inter-laboratory comparison of results. As whole-genome sequencing technologies decrease in price and increase in speed and simplicity, however, it is expected that metagenomics approaches will be applied more often in public health emergencies, and routine pipelines are likely to evolve from ongoing collaborations between researchers and clinicians. Such forward steps will be crucial for increasing our arsenal of tools in public health, thus allowing us to rapidly detect and to manage novel and emerging infectious diseases.",
