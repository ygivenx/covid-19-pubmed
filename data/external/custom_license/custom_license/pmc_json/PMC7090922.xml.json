The most common chronic lung disease is asthma, but there is an immunological basis for many other lung diseases, which span a vast clinical spectrum of lung disorders ranging from infectious lung disease to cancer. Several significant challenge areas include the diagnosis and treatment of certain specific infectious lung diseases, including viral lower respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronovirus, and enterovirus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoA) was responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the early 2000s that originated in Asia and led to significant mortality in those afflicted. Other viruses such as bird flu and swine flu have the ability to cause respiratory tract disease as well. Tuberculosis is another primarily respiratory infection that has been resistant to eradication. New strains of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have emerged. Other challenges involve the genetic diseases cystic fibrosis and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune lung diseases, lung diseases that are part of a systemic autoimmune disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The diagnosis and treatment of hypersensitivity pneumonitis still poses problems to clinicians. Biomarkers are continually being developed in lung and other cancers, but more research is needed [1]. The genetics of cystic fibrosis are now well elucidated, but the development of a successful gene therapy has been unexpectedly slow (Table 1).\n",

This attributes the rise in incidence to the reduced rate of infectious diseases, cleaner living environments, and, in general, those features that accompany a higher standard of living. But, conversely, the annual death rates per 100,000 asthmatics tend to be higher in the economically poorer countries. This emphasizes the most significant global concern regarding asthma care, which is access to care and medications. In developed countries, this problem is less prevalent, and in countries such as the USA, we are primarily focused on asthma education and compliance issues. In both situations, severe asthma is still a problem in that it impacts quality of life and still contributes to considerable morbidity and mortality.",

It is increasingly clear that there is no single medication that works for all patients with severe asthma. While patient compliance is an issue, we frequently fall into the trap of believing the problem is always patient compliance, when in fact, it may be that patients are not taking their medications because they perceive that they do not work. Nevertheless, the explosive growth in the availability of new pharmaceutical interventions provides us with an arsenal of controller medications, at least in the developed world. More medications are being developed every day, including the newer class of biological modulators against cytokines and chemokines [3], such as anti-IL5 [4, 5] and anti-IL4r\u03b1 [6, 7]. The next challenge will involve the identification of suitable patients for these new and existing treatments.",

Moreover, asthma in children is also significantly different from that in adults, and the response to medications varies based on multiple and not a single factor. The choice and exclusion of confounding variables has been a thorn in the side of those attempting to define a specific asthma phenotype.

The initial study describing the gene named \u201ccystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR)\u201d was first published in the late 1980s by Tsui et al. [26, 29\u201336]. This discovery led to a localization of the gene to chromosome 7, leading to widespread belief that a cure for CF utilizing gene therapy was right around the corner. The landmark development of a molecular biology technique which became known as genetic targeting in mice, pioneered by Capecchi [37\u201340], Evans [41, 42], and Smithies [43\u201347], promised gene replacement in humans in a similar way to that performed in mice. Twenty-four years later, there are new advancements in the management of cystic fibrosis with regard to pharmacological and supportive respiratory treatment, but still no cure. These advancements have prolonged the longevity of patients with CF, but their life expectancy still only averages to be about 35 years. So, what happened to gene therapy? What happened to all that promise that buoyed the cystic fibrosis community back in the 1980s?",

This technique can either target cells globally or be restricted to a certain group or location of cells. But gene therapy has not progressed as smoothly or as quickly as anticipated. Previously unrecognized barriers became apparent [48]. These included the fact that studies were initially focused on molecular or biochemical outcomes and not on clinical efficacy. Moreover, the administration of the gene would need to be repeated due to epithelial turnover. Repeated administration leads to host recognition, which may inhibit gene expression. Questions on which cells to target in order to achieve efficacy has slowed research. The use of viral material, including viral DNA and liposomes, could potentially lead to inflammatory responses. The point is that unexpected consequences were discovered as research proceeded, and this has had an impact on the progress of gene research.",

Globally, there are over 30 million new lower respiratory tract infections per year and approximately 200,000 deaths per year in children fewer than 5 years of age. The majority of these deaths occur in low-income countries where access to care may be limited. The search for a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been ongoing for many years, but like the previous case of gene therapy in cystic fibrosis, this also has been a challenge to achieve. In the absence of a vaccine, researchers have developed passive immunization to the virus in the form of a monoclonal antibody to RSV, named palivizumab. The current global strategies for the development of an RSV vaccine now target four areas: infants <6 months of age; infants >6 months of age and young children; pregnant women for whom passive immunization can be implemented; and the elderly, in whom RSV can also have significant morbidity [52\u201354].",

This may also apply to older infants or young children who may still be RSV-naive. The issues in adults are just the opposite as most adults have been exposed to RSV and thus have RSV antibodies. The effectiveness of passively immunizing pregnant women in order to deliver IgG across the placenta to the fetus must be weighed against possible adverse effects of such a \u201cvaccine\u201d on the fetus.

Thus, drug resistance is a significant challenge in the treatment of TB in the twenty-first century.

One of the areas that are being focused on now has to do with the identification of biomarkers. Biomarkers can play several roles in the improvement of treatment of TB in the world. The main areas of focus for research in biomarkers are to identify those that can perform the following functions: (1) prediction of a curative state, (2) prediction of reactivation of TB, and (3) prediction of immunity to TB. In the past, biomarkers for TB would normally involve culturing for the organism, but the development of molecular biology techniques has afforded us the use of non-culture biomarkers.",

Efforts to reduce the length of treatment are dependent on the discovery of more effective treatment as well as being able to monitor the treatment.

The addition of second-line drugs for the treatment of these more difficult to treat patients is plagued by longer periods of treatment, higher cost, and reduced efficacy. The drugs often used for second-line treatment include aminoglycosides, terizidone, protionamide, capreomycin, fluroquinolones, cycloserine, and ethionamide. The mortality of MDR and XDR TB in HIV patients is particularly high, and researchers have focused on novel approaches to combat this global health issue, including revamping of efforts to develop a vaccine for TB [87\u201392], treatment of latent infection to reduce reservoir pools of infection, and the development of predictive biomarkers. One should not forget that for years we have had a vaccine for TB, the BCG vaccine named after Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin. While this vaccine has been used primarily in underdeveloped countries and has been administered to over 4 billion people worldwide, the limitations include an inability to protect against adult TB and adverse effects when used in HIV-positive TB patients.

The willingness of patients to contribute to research, and the regulatory landscape for the collection of samples for research, could potentially negatively impact the ability to conduct large-scale studies on biomarkers. For a comprehensive review of biomarkers, diagnostics, drug treatment, and vaccine development, the reader is referred to an excellent series of articles published in Lancet in 2010 [74, 89, 101].",

This trend flies in the face of an availability of, first, the killed whole organism pertussis vaccine DTwP and, subsequently, the acellular vaccine (DPaP). The acellular vaccine was less reactogenic because it incorporated a step during manufacturing that removed endotoxin, which was a major reason for the adverse side effect profile. It was clear that vaccination against pertussis afforded much improved prevention of the disease, as illustrated by the 157-fold decreased rate for pertussis between the 1930s and 1940s. DTwP vaccines were used until the 1990s, when technological development in the 1970s and 1980s led to the introduction of commercially available acellular pertussis vaccines [102].",

Earlier, we discussed several examples that illustrate the difficulty of bringing an effective vaccine to market (TB and RSV). The problems associated with pertussis are clearly different. There are several reasons that may explain why we have not eradicated the disease. It is well documented that the DTaP vaccine is not as immunogenic as the whole organism DTwP vaccines. Studies have indicated that the overall efficacy of DTaP vaccines is below 70 %. We do not normally test for pertussis titers following vaccination, except in studies. But there are those who suggest that the increase in pertussis cases is mainly due to the increased ability to diagnose the disease and to an increased awareness. Yet another challenge may be that pertussis has mutated over the years, rendering the vaccine less effective. Because our current vaccine is <70 % effective, the ability of mutant strains to evade destruction would lead to their preferential survival.",

It has also become apparent that the balance of antigens in the vaccine may play a role in determining efficacy. For example, a whole-cell pertussis vaccine with antigenic components PT, FHA, and FIM was compared to an acellular pertussis vaccine in children. The whole-cell vaccine produced high levels of antibodies to PRN and FIM, but low levels to PT and FHA, in contrast to the acellular pertussis vaccine which produced high levels of antibody to PT and FHA. More than one study has suggested that the vaccine components may antagonize each other. It has been found that the antibody levels to FHA do not correlate with the efficacy of the vaccine; furthermore, it has been suggested that adding FHA to a vaccine may actually suppress efficacy.",

Understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases is another significant unmet need which requires commitment of funding and resources [140]. The respective contributory roles of genes, epigenetics, and the environment in the pathogenesis of lung diseases must be better elucidated [141\u2013148]. With better understanding of disease comes better diagnostic markers and better treatment.",

New techniques for vaccination which will hopefully alleviate concerns of vaccines among vaccine-apprehensive patients may help lead to the eradication of infectious respiratory disease such as TB, pertussis, and RSV. There is much work yet to be done, and it is important to remember that diseases are not static either, especially in the context of pathogen-related diseases as pathogens are also very adept at evading our efforts to destroy them.",

More specifically, these would include the identification of biomarkers to provide less invasive methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, as well as determining prognosis, the development of new drugs and treatment modalities, and also the development of vaccines or other environmental controls to reduce the incidence of the disease.\n",
