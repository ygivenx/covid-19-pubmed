Genome-sequence analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV has an animal origin, from an as-yet unknown reservoir2. SARS is most commonly spread by close person-to-person contact, which involves exposure to infectious respiratory droplets. Estimates of the incubation period have converged at 2\u201310 days3, and modelling data from Hong Kong indicate that 95% of cases have incubation periods of up to 14 days. An incubation period of 1 day has been reported in a small number of cases4. Transmission is amplified in healthcare settings, although community transmission also occurs2. The sentinel event for the international spread of SARS has been attributed to environmental contamination in a hotel5, and point-source outbreaks have occurred through faecally contaminated aerosols in housing estates in Hong Kong6.",

As of 26 September 2003, the WHO had received reports of more than 8,000 probable cases of SARS and 774 deaths due to SARS, giving a global fatality rate of 9.6% (Ref. 10).

The WHO, together with its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners, brought together an international team of health professionals \u2014 including clinicians, virologists, epidemiologists, public health professionals and environmental engineers \u2014 to study and contain the disease. This international response enabled the rapid identification of the infectious agent, its mode of transmission and the development of diagnostic tests. Traditional public health measures (for example, case detection and isolation, stringent infection control, contact tracing and surveillance) were used globally to successfully break the chain of transmission11. SARS remains a public health challenge for several reasons, including nonspecific symptoms and signs, a lack of diagnostic tests that can be used to reliably detect SARS-CoV in the first few days of illness, the risk of superspreading events (which fuelled large disease clusters in the 2003 outbreak), the lack of a vaccine or agreed treatment modalities and limited data on the ongoing risk of interspecies transmission. Re-emergence of SARS on a large-scale is possible and preparedness of public health and healthcare systems is important to prevent and control the disease.",

The recommendations made include further elucidation of the transmission dynamics, such as interspecies transmission; a risk-benefit analysis of therapeutic modalities used during the outbreak; the development of protocols for future multicentre clinical trials, diagnostic quality assurance and laboratory biosafety; and analysis of the social and economic impact of SARS and the public health measures used to control it.
