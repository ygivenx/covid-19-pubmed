Coronaviruses interacting with the cell membrane or inside the cell cytoplasm were easily seen when grown in swine testicle cells (Figure, A and C). Coronaviruses bud at the intermediate compartment and Golgi membranes (Figure, C) and the cytopathic effect on infected cells differed from that observed after infection by the EBN-associated virus. The most characteristic features of EBN-associated virus infection were the accumulation of stacked intracellular membranes and a general disorganization of the cytoplasmic membranous system (Figure, D). No apparent effect on the nucleus structure was observed. Electron-dense spherical virus particles approximately 30 nm in diameter were observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells but not in the nucleus. The size of these particles corresponds to that of the virions partially purified from the same cells. The particles appear to have an internal dense nucleocapsid (Figure, C). No viral factories were identified in association with the membranous structures. No viruslike particles were observed in uninfected Vero cells that resembled the virions described in the infected ones.",

In contrast, electron microscopy preparations of TGEV observed in parallel showed virions approximately 120 nm in diameter, with a corona of typical projecting peplomers 8,9 (Figure, C). The morphology of TGEV clearly differed from that of the EBN-associated virus that had no peplomers.

The dominant and only virus detected in the cell cultures infected with the EBN-associated virus was unrelated to coronaviruses. Accordingly, we think that the involvement of a coronavirus should no longer be considered in EBN induction. Further studies are needed to clarify the nature of the 28.4-nm, non-enveloped virus particles found in the kidney cells of patients with EBN and to determine whether this virus is the causal agent of the disease.",
