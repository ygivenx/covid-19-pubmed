            "text": "The dynamic nature of proteins is one of the key elements of their function. Although this principle is widely accepted, the detailed characterization of protein motions at atomic resolution is much more challenging than determining the average static structure. High field NMR is a particularly powerful method for studying protein dynamics at atomic resolution over a wide array of time scales and has therefore extensively been used in the last two decades. The major emphasis on the development of ultra-high-field magnets for an increase in sensitivity and resolution has allowed investigations on ever-larger biomolecular systems. Ironically, this high-field regime is not as sensitive to mesodynamics as relaxation data at lower fields. Low-field R1 relaxation experiments covering 1H Larmor frequencies up to several tens of MHz have been performed using field-cycling relaxometers (Kimmich 1996; Luchinat and Parigi 2007). Due to the low resolution, these experiments have usually probed the relaxation of solvent protons as reporters, and are therefore limited. Here we report R1 relaxation data of a protein at low field, but with atomic resolution, using a field-cycling apparatus in a commercial 500 MHz magnet (Redfield 2003). By physically moving the sample in the magnet bore the relaxation behavior can be investigated at various low fields; however, the return of the sample to its initial position allows these measurements with the resolution and sensitivity of the high field.",

Previous experiments have indicated a flexible \u03b2-hairpin in addition to a relatively rigid antiparallel \u03b2-sheet based on the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE at 500 MHz (Huang et al. 2004). Sampling the spectral density over this wider range enabled us to robustly determine the time scale of motions of the hairpin and additional loops (Fig. 1). Heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE at differing fields (50.7\u201391.2 MHz) were particularly useful for establishing the internal correlation times in the disordered regions. Matching internal correlation times of about 0.8 ns for many of these residues are suggestive of correlated motions, which were buttressed by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent.",

A standard thin-walled 5 mm NMR tube is modified with plastic inserts epoxied above and below the sample to avoid bubbles. Previous iterations of this device used a pneumatic driver for the shuttle, but the violent deceleration of the sample at either end of transit apparently led to protein denaturation, even though samples are tightly sealed and degassed to minimize turbulence as described previously (Redfield 2003). The system has therefore been rebuilt to use a stepper motor to drive a timing belt and push rod to move the sample, allowing for more controlled deceleration (Redfield, in preparation). Experiments with ferro-cytochrome c were performed to verify that temperature variations during field-cycling could be neglected (data not shown).",

The position of the sample in the fringe field was controlled by digital input to the stepper motor. The field strengths reported in the results reflect the measured field at the center of the sample. R1 measurements at low field used a standard experiment (Farrow et al. 1994) with the addition of commands to control the field-cycling apparatus, and 100\u2013150 ms delays to accommodate the raising and lowering of the sample. This transit delay was adjusted to account for the greater distance necessary to sample low fields. In order to compensate for signal attenuation due to relaxation in transit, 4\u20138 times as many transients were acquired for these experiments as at high field. Field-cycling did not affect the lock to a greater extent than did a strong gradient pulse, and no degradation of the lock was observed over the course of the experiment. Proton inversion pulses during the relaxation period were not feasible because of the inhomogeneity of the fringe field and absence of a transmitter coil at the relevant height.",

For R1 and R2, peak intensities were fit to mono-exponential decay equations using an in-house program. Errors in the measurements were assessed from base-plane noise and duplicated points; because of the interleaved acquisition, both approaches resulted in similar estimated errors. Model-free fits were performed using relxn2.2 (Lee et al. 1999) and the graphical front-end rvi (Clarkson et al. 2006); only relaxation data from 50.7 MHz and above were used in the final fits. Data were weighted by error for \u03c72 minimization, which for purposes of fitting was defined as the larger of the fitted error or 5%. Excluding flexible residues (Vuister et al. 1993), a \u03c4m of 11.9 ns was determined by global minimization and used in all subsequent fits. An estimation of tumbling anisotropy using local fits of \u03c4m and the 1SSK structure (Huang et al. 2004) with the program qfit (Lee et al. 1999) indicated D\u2016/D\u22a5 of 0.94, and anisotropy was therefore disregarded in subsequent fitting procedures. Errors in single fits were assessed using a Monte Carlo method in which random values consistent with the measured errors were added to the original data and the fit repeated. The total number of Monte Carlo simulations used was 150 for each residue.",

Residues for which more than one violation of model-free constraints (order parameters greater than one or less than zero, or \u03c4e/\u03c4s \u2265 \u03c4m) occurred during the jackknife procedure were shifted to a simpler model. No residues experienced multiple violations during the jackknife when model 2 was used. The initial rounds of model selection included models that incorporate REX corrections to the R2 data (models 3 and 4). However, these models were not ultimately selected for any residues because CPMG relaxation dispersion gave no indication of REX (data not shown), and refinement of model selection excluded those models. Accordingly, the only models used in the final analysis were model 2 (S2, \u03c4e) (Lipari and Szabo 1982), and model 5 (\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}$$ S^{ 2}_{\\text{s}} $$\\end{document}, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}$$ S^{ 2}_{\\text{f}} $$\\end{document}, \u03c4s) (Clore et al. 1990).

The attenuation of the NOEs at higher fields strongly suggests an internal mesodynamic fluctuation. The 15N NOE is the ratio RNOE\u03b3H/R1 \u03b3N, where RNOE is approximately proportional to J(\u03c9H) since \u03c9N \u226a \u03c9H, and R1 is proportional to J(\u03c9N) (Abragam 1961). This ratio changes little for rigid residues over a twofold change in Larmor frequency because the respective spectral density values are essentially constant over this frequency range. In contrast, the observed field-dependence of the NOE for flexible residues indicates the presence of a transition in the spectral density over this frequency range. Moreover, the range of Larmor frequencies sampled defines upper and lower bounds for the internal correlation time \u03c4 (\u03c9\u03c4 \u2248 1 for the center of the transition) of 150 ps < \u03c4 < 3 ns.

Error from interference between CSA and dipolar relaxation mechanisms is of particular concern here, due to the inability to regularly invert proton polarization during the relaxation period in the field-cycled experiments. While this effect certainly contributes to the observed bias towards too low R1 values, it is not possible to account for the entire effect at 17.3 and 30.2 MHz using analytical calculations of \u03b7z, implying that the observed bias cannot be attributed to any single source of interference.",

As a result, the field is inhomogeneous over the 1.5 cm length of the sample, with a maximal variation of 1.4 T at 30.2 MHz (7 T). The remaining difference between prediction and experiment could in part result from this field inhomogeneity, but could also arise from technical error or from some previously unrecognized shortcoming of the model-free theory. These questions should be investigated further in future by a more complete survey between 5 and 9 T, or possibly at lower field using 13C carbonyl relaxation. Below 4 T the relaxation rate is expected to be too fast to be measured with our shuttle device for any nuclear spin adjacent to a geminal proton because of relaxation of the measured nuclear spin by the proton. For the results presented here, this uncertainty does not significantly affect the conclusions.",

The MD simulations now provide a rationale for this observation: during the simulations, direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds form between several residues in the hairpin and these flexible loops. For example, the side-chain of R90 hydrogen-bonds temporarily to residues in both loops (Fig. 7c). These interactions seem to be responsible for coordinating motions of the hairpin and those loops, explaining the similarity of relaxation dispersions at these sites. Strikingly, the MD simulations elucidate the collective nature of the mesodynamics of the entire \u03b2-hairpin and the correlation of motions between the hairpin and the 60\u201364 loop. These correlations can be computed from the time traces of atomic fluctuations within one molecule through a covariance matrix (Fig. 7d), emphasizing the value of MD simulations to complement the NMR experiments.",

Given that these residues have very similar internal correlation times and cluster structurally together, we suggest that the relaxation behavior is the result of correlated motions of the hairpin and the 60\u201364 loop. This model is buttressed by MD simulations. The \u03b2-hairpin and the 60\u201364 loop coincide with several previously-identified sites where SARSN engages in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, including a ubiquitination site at K62. That areas of significant flexibility in SARSN coincide with residues important for binding interactions is not surprising, because disordered regions in proteins are often associated with promiscuous binding activity (Fink 2005). However our current data do not provide mechanistic insight into the relation between dynamics and SARS function.",

The methods of field-cycling (Roberts et al. 2004; Sivanandam et al. 2009) will continue to be very useful in other contexts: for example, experiments with 13C carbonyls where the absence of an attached proton will probably make measurements to zero field feasible, as they are for 31P.",
