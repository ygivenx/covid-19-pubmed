This species has adapted to urban areas, occupying roofs, ceilings, and other human constructions, and often coexists with other bat species and humans (2), enabling epidemiologic risks (3). In recent studies, an alphacoronavirus has been detected in urban bat species Molossus molossus, M. rufus, and Tadarida brasiliensi in Brazil (4,5). Evidence suggests that alphacoronaviruses may use bats as hosts to spread human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, which originated by evolution of Appalachian Ridge CoV strain 2 (ARCoV.2) (6).",

The sequences obtained had 87.5% (126/144) nucleotide identity with ARCoV.2, an unclassified alphacoronavirus (GenBank accession no. JX537912) for which a zoonotic role has been suggested (6). Preliminary analysis indicated good coverage of the polymerase region of the ARCoV.2 reference sequence by the reads (quality index >40) by using reference assembly against CoV complete genomes. This finding reinforces the hypothesis of this viral agent in the specimens analyzed. Moreover, molecular assays are underway in our laboratory to elucidate the alternative hypothesis of PEDV presence in bats in Brazil.",
