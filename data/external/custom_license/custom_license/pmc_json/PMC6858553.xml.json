They cause severe encephalitis and respiratory illness, with fatality rates of 50\u2013100%, and are classified as biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) select agents1. Unlike several other paramyxoviruses, HNVs have a broad species tropism (as is the case for canine distemper virus2) and can infect animals from at least six mammalian orders1. Pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes) appear to be the predominant natural reservoir hosts of HNVs3. Since the first outbreaks of HeV in Australia in 1994 and of NiV in Malaysia in 1998, HeV repeatedly infected horses in Australia with resultant human exposures4, while food-borne mediated NiV spillovers have occurred nearly every year in Bangladesh5. Furthermore, NiV outbreaks have occurred in the Philippines and in India6. Besides Asia and Oceania, the detection of anti-HNV antibodies in humans and Pteropus bats in Africa, a continent in which no documented NiV or HeV outbreaks have occurred, further suggests that future HNV zoonotic emergence is likely to happen7. Although more than two billion people live in regions threatened by potential HNV outbreaks, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutics against these pathogens.",

            "text": "Paramyxoviruses deliver their genome to the host cytoplasm by fusing their lipid envelope with the cellular membrane to initiate infection. This process requires the concerted action of two surface glycoproteins, attachment (G/H/HN) and fusion (F), which sets the paramyxovirus entry machinery apart from all other class I fusion proteins. G is a type II homotetrameric transmembrane protein with an ectodomain comprising a stalk and a C-terminal \u03b2-propeller head, and the latter domain is responsible for binding to ephrinB2 or ephrinB3 (ephrinB2/B3) receptors8\u201312. F is a homotrimeric type I transmembrane protein that is synthesized as a premature F0 precursor and cleaved by cathepsin L during endocytic recycling to yield the mature, disulfide-linked, F1 and F2 subunits13\u201315. Viral fusion proteins are believed to exist in a kinetically trapped metastable conformation at the virus surface16. Upon binding to ephrinB2/B3, NiV G has been proposed to undergo conformational changes leading to F triggering and insertion of the F hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target membrane8,17,18. Subsequent refolding into the more stable postfusion F conformation drives merger of the viral and host membranes to form a pore for genome delivery to the cell cytoplasm, as shown for other paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses13,19\u201324.",

We report here the cloning, sequencing and humanization of 5B3 (h5B3.1) and demonstrate it bound with high affinity to prefusion NiV F and HeV F. Neutralization assays, carried out under BSL-4 containment, showed that 5B3 and h5B3.1 potently inhibited NiV and HeV infection of target cells. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the NiV F trimer in complex with 5B3 and found the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope that is conserved in NiV F and HeV F. Our structural data, combined with F-triggering and membrane fusion assays, demonstrate that 5B3 locks F in the prefusion conformation and prevents membrane fusion via molecular stapling, providing a molecular rationale for its potency. These results define a critical neutralization epitope on the surface of the NiV and HeV F glycoproteins and pave the way for the future use of h5B3.1 for prophylaxis or as therapeutic for NiV- and HeV-infected individuals.",

In agreement with the features observed in the cryo-EM map, the local resolution is highest for most of the NiV F and the 5B3 variable domains, including the interface between NiV F and 5B3, whereas the Fab constant domains are poorly resolved, due to elbow flexibility between constant and variable domains, and were not modeled.

All six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) (and the light chain framework region 2) contribute to the paratope and bury 980 \u00c52 at the interface with the NiV F epitope, which mostly resides within one protomer (Fig. 3a,b). CDRL1 contacts the NiV F heptad-repeat A (HRA) \u03b2-hairpin via electrostatic interactions between Gln275B3 and Lys160F, Gln162F and Thr168F (Fig. 3a\u2013c, Extended Data 2).

CDRH2 protrudes at the interface between two NiV F protomers and interacts with a segment C-terminal to the central helix and with the upstream helix of a neighboring protomer (Fig. 3a\u2013c and Extended Data 2).

            "text": "5B3 relies on an atypical binding mode to NiV F with nearly equal contributions of the heavy (48%) and light (52%) chains to the antibody buried surface area. This, in part, results from the fact that CDRL1 is making a greater contribution to the paratope than the nine residue-long CDRH3 (268 \u00c52 versus 190 \u00c52 of buried surface area, respectively), in contrast with the canonical CDRH3-dominated antibody/antigen interfaces. To confirm these findings, we probed the NiV F binding ability of single-chain (scFv) chimeric constructs in which either the variable heavy (VH) or variable light (VL) h5B3 chains were replaced with an unrelated chain from a human scFv library. Although h5B3 scFv immunoprecipitated full-length NiV F, none of the scFv chimeras did, in agreement with the equivalent contributions to binding of the heavy and light chains observed in our structure (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data 4a). The structural data were further validated using site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues participating in the NiV F epitope followed by 5B3-mediated immunoprecipitation to assess residual binding (Extended Data 4b). We also used the prefusion F specific 12B2 antibody as well as a cell\u2013cell fusion assay to probe the conformational integrity of the F mutants analyzed (Extended Data 4b,c). The NiV F K55A substitution inhibited 5B3 recognition, which is probably explained by the loss of interactions with CDRL1 Trp325B3 and CDRL3 Tyr925B3 residues, as visualized in our structure. Furthermore, abrogation of 5B3 binding to NiV F L53D or L53S probably resulted from reduction of favorable interactions with CDRL1 Trp325B3, CDRL3 Phe915B3 and CRH3 Tyr1025B3. Given that the tested mutants bound to the12B2 antibody and retained 40\u2013100% of the wild-type F fusion activity (Extended Data 4b,c), we conclude that the observed loss of binding largely resulted from specific disruption of interactions with 5B3, without major effects on the overall F structure.",

To assess the possibility of generating 5B3 neutralization-escape virus mutants, such as the aforementioned binding-deficient F mutants identified by site-directed mutagenesis, we passaged authentic NiV for three rounds in the presence of 5B3 in BSL-4 containment. Plaque purified resistant viruses were isolated, and viral RNA from five NiV isolates was reverse-transcribed into cDNA for sequencing of the F gene. All five NiV escape mutants harbored the same F K55E substitution. This finding supports our aforementioned mutagenesis data because the NiV F K55A was completely defective in 5B3 binding. We recombinantly produced the K55E F mutant and observed it could not bind 5B3 while maintaining its ability to interact with 12B2 and to promote wild-type cell\u2013cell fusion activity (Extended Data 4b,c).

The antibody recognizes a discontinuous epitope, spanning two neighboring protomers, present only in prefusion F, based on the conformational changes observed in the related parainfluenza virus 3 postfusion F and respiratory syncytial virus postfusion F structures20,23,24 (Figs. 3a\u2013c and 4a,b). Furthermore, CDRL1 interactions with the HRA \u03b2-hairpin hinders refolding of the latter motif to contribute to the formation of an elongated central helix, observed in the postfusion F state. This antibody-mediated molecular stapling strategy, involving simultaneous interactions with protein segments that are close to each other in prefusion F but far apart in postfusion F (Fig. 4a,b), is conceptually equivalent to the disulfide stapling approach implemented for stabilizing the prefusion conformation of measles virus F40, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F41, HeV F42 and PIV F43 glycoproteins. Finally, we predict unfavorable steric clashes would occur with a 5B3 antibody bound to a neighboring protomer upon F refolding.",

We previously showed peptides derived from the heptad-repeat B (HRB) sequence of NiV F or HeV F prevent completion of F refolding and are potent inhibitors of fusion and live virus infection44,45. Furthermore, when the triggering assay was carried out in the presence of a biotinylated HRB peptide, a conformational intermediate of the fusion reaction was captured and could be used as a reporter of F activation. Using this approach, we demonstrate here that addition of 5B3 or h5B3.1 during the triggering assay blocked fusogenic conformational changes in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas a non-neutralizing control antibody (13G5), specific for postfusion F, did not (Fig. 4c,d). Subsequent antibody affinity purification (protein G) of the material not captured by the HRB peptide showed 5B3 (or h5B3.1) remained bound to F (Fig. 4d), supporting the hypothesis that 5B3/h5B3.1 trap NiV F in the prefusion conformation. Finally, capture of an F intermediate could be partially rescued by raising the temperature to \u226560 \u00b0C, indicating that binding of 5B3/h5B3.1 stabilizes NiV F by raising the energy barrier for transitioning to the postfusion state (Fig. 4e). In summary, the structural and biochemical data presented here show 5B3/h5B3.1 inhibited fusogenic conformational changes by locking F in the prefusion state and raising the free energy of activation for fusion triggering.",

Previous work showed that most of the RSV-neutralizing activity in human serum is conferred by antibodies specifically recognizing prefusion F46. Structure-based physical stabilization of the RSV F prefusion state via mutations and fusion to another protein (domain) as well as multivalent display on a computationally designed nanoparticle platform correlated with increased elicitation of neutralizing mAbs22,41,47,48. Prefusion stabilized F also induced greater neutralizing humoral immune responses than postfusion F against parainfluenza viruses in mice and rhesus macaques43. However, antibodies present in the sera of mice immunized with human metapneumovirus prefusion or postfusion F ectodomain trimers bound similarly to either protein conformation and equally neutralized virus infectivity, demonstrating that prefusion and postfusion F share most neutralizing epitopes for this virus49. We previously established that fusing a GCN4 trimeric motif at the C-terminal end of the NiV F and HeV F ectodomains resulted in the production of prefusion stabilized trimers that could elicit a neutralizing antibody response in mice17.

We successfully engineered a humanized version of 5B3 (termed h5B3.1), which retained comparable breadth and potency to the parental mouse mAb and inhibited F-mediated membrane fusion.

We postulate that similar outcomes could be expected with comparably high doses of 5B3/h5B3.1 mAbs. Furthermore, neutralization escape mutations to such an F-specific mAb could have a potentially negative impact on viral growth, replication and virulence, as observed with mutants obtained with anti-G antibodies28. Finally, the use of antibody cocktails has been proposed for Ebola virus50\u201352 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)53 and implemented as a commercially available therapeutic for hepatitis C virus (XTL-6865, XTL Biopharmaceuticals) to prevent and/or limit the emergence of such mutants as well as enhance neutralization breadth. We suggest a similar strategy: combining h5B3.1 and m102.4 or other anti-HNV mAbs, targeting multiple antigenic sites on G and F, could be implemented for treating future NiV and HeV infections.",

We adapted previously described methods and PCR primers employed for the generation of naive human scFv library constructed from peripheral blood B cells of several healthy donors56 by using only the VH subfamily III and \u03ba VL subfamily I primers. VH and VL were first amplified separately from the IgM cDNA library. For VH, we used forward and reverse primers probing the FR1 and FR4 of VH III with restriction site SfiI added to the 5\u2032 end of the forward primer and (G4S)3 linker sequence added to the 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer. For VL, we used forward and reverse primers probing the FR1 and FR4 of VL\u03ba I with (G4S)3 linker sequence added to the 5\u2032 end of the forward primer and restriction site SfiI added to the 3\u2032 end of the reverse primer. The scFv library was assembled by overlapping PCR combining the VH and VL PCR products as template and using the VH III FR1 SfiI forward and VL\u03ba I FR4 SfiI reverse primers. The amplified scFv was then cloned into a pCom3X vector harboring a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. Colonies from the scFv library were grown and expressed as previously described57. We selected the 12 best expressing clones for DNA sequencing based on Coomassie blue staining and western blot analysis using an anti-histidine tag antibody. The translated human scFv FR sequences were then aligned against that of 5B3. For humanization of 5B3, conserved human residues from the alignment were identified and replaced into the homologous positions of 5B3 to generate h5B3. To further humanize h5B3, a version named h5B3.1 was generated from h5B3 where one residue on each of the CDR1 and CDR2 and two residues on CDR3 were mutated into conserved human residues based on the sequences from the human scFv library mentioned above.",
