PEDV was first reported in England in 1971 [3] and then detected in Japan in 1982 and subsequently confirmed in other southeastern Asian countries [4]. In the USA, PEDV was first reported in 2013 and has since rapidly spread throughout the country [5, 6]. In China, the incidence of PEDV outbreaks has rapidly increased since 2010, especially among newborn piglets aged from a few hours to one week, often resulting in death due to watery diarrhea and dehydration [7, 8]. Although the use of inactivated and attenuated vaccines may have helped to reduce the prevalence of disease, PEDV has continually emerged, causing tremendous losses to the swine industry in China [9].",

            "text": "PEDV, a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb encoding four structural proteins: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins [10, 11]. The S protein is a glycoprotein consisting of 1383\u20131387 amino acids (aa) on the viral surface, which is composed of four regions, a signal peptide (aa 1\u201324), an extracellular region, a transmembrane domain (aa 1,334\u20131,356), and a short cytoplasmic tail (aa 1,357\u20131,383) [12]. Unlike other coronaviruses (i.e., murine coronavirus and bovine coronavirus), the S protein of PEDV cannot be cleaved into S1 and S2 domains after PEDV maturation. Thus, the S1 domain (residues 1\u2013789) and S2 domain (aa 790\u20131383) of PEDV are artificially defined based on homology to other coronavirus S proteins [13, 14]. The S protein is responsible for binding and fusion of the virus to the host cells. It therefore not only determines cellular tropism but also plays a vital role in inducing production of neutralizing antibodies in the host [15, 16].",

Based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length S sequences isolated in China, PEDVs can be divided into two genotypes, G1 and G2 [19]. Furthermore, PEDV detected in China from 2010 to 2012 were mostly variant strains (most belonging to subtype G2) that differed genetically from the CV777 vaccine strain (belonging to subtype G1) [20]. However, many pig herds vaccinated with inactivated or attenuated CV777 vaccines still experienced high mortality rates among newborn piglets [17, 21]. Therefore, further evaluation of the immunogenicity and antigenic relationships of PEDV subtypes G1 and G2 is of vital importance. In the present study, we expressed the full-length S gene in a eukaryotic expression system, prepared anti-S polyclonal antibodies (PAbs), and performed subsequent experiments to investigate differences in antigenicity between the PEDV subtypes to determine if mutations in the S gene are the cause of immunization failure. The findings of this study also lay a foundation for further study of the function of the S protein and to facilitate development of PAbs against PEDV.",

In China, mortality due to PEDV infection can reach 80 %\u2013100 % in piglets less than 10 days old [25]. In the USA, PEDV infection has resulted in a loss of almost 10 % of the domestic pig population after only a 1-year epidemic period [26]. Located on the surface of PEDV, the S protein plays an pivotal role in recognizing receptors of target cells, thereby inducing production of neutralizing antibodies by activated host immune cells [15, 16]. Although there have been relatively few studies using full-length sequences of the PEDV S protein, most investigating the immunogenicity of the PEDV S protein have focused on the S1 region [27\u201329]. As PEDV S protein cannot be cleaved into S1 and S2 domains after virus maturation and S2 domain may also have potential neutralizing linear and conformational epitopes, the whole S protein with its native conformation might be a better immunogen than the S1 protein. Previously, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike proteins have been shown to produce high-titer antibodies in mice [30]. In the present study, we successfully expressed and purified the full-length S protein using a eukaryotic expression system. Western blot analysis confirmed that the S protein was specifically detected by anti-Flag antibodies (Fig. 1B). The IFA indicated that the S protein was expressed at higher levels in HEK 293T cells through codon optimization (Fig. 1A), as demonstrated with other coronaviruses [31].",

            "text": "The PEDV S protein has 27\u201330 potential glycosylation sites that help to maintain its biological function [32]. Therefore, we chose a eukaryotic expression system that was particularly useful for the production of such a large multi-domain protein requiring complex folding machinery and post-translational modifications [33] so that the structure of the S protein was close to the naturally occurring conformation. Other advantages of choosing a eukaryotic expression system were that the expressed fusion protein was soluble as the biological function was maintained [34, 35]. In the present study, we established a method to express and purify the PEDV S protein, which can be used not only to evaluate immunogenicity but also to study S protein function. The IgG levels of mice immunized with the S protein were significantly increased beginning on post-immunization day 14, and antibody titers reached 1:204,800 on post-immunization day 42 according to the ELISA results (Fig. 2). The high IgG antibody titers of immunized mice indicated that purified S protein may be a good candidate as an immunogen for PAb production and diagnostic methods.",

            "text": "Since 2010, PEDV outbreaks in several provinces have caused significant economic losses to the swine industry in China [7, 8]. Although a CV777-inactivated vaccine has been used to immunize swine herds against PEDV infection, its efficacy has been rather low [8]. Therefore, it is of vital importance to develop a CV777 vaccine that can cross-protect against epidemic strains of the G2 subtype. Previous studies have found differences in the antigenicity between PEDV CV777 and strains isolated in the USA, and some pig antibodies and MAbs showed 4- to 16-fold differences between the titers of the homologous and heterologous strains CCIF and VN, as at least one epitope on the N-terminal region of PEDV/TGEV N protein contributed to this cross-reactivity [36]. However, the MAbs used in the previous study were against the N protein, which is not the major antigen that induces production of neutralizing antibodies by host cells. In our previous study, we also found twofold differences in pig antibodies based on SN titers between strains CV7777 and LNCT2 (data not shown). A comparison of sequences of two types of PEDV G2 S protein from 14 recent Chinese epidemic strains from 2011 to 2015 showed that they had 90.4 %\u201393.8 % sequence identity to the CV777 vaccine strain (Table 1), and sequence variations were concentrated in the N-terminal region of the S protein due to a point mutation, a deletion, and an insertion of four amino acids. The LNCT2 strain we chose belonged to the G2 subtype, and its S sequence was 92.3 % identical to that of the CV777 vaccine strain (G1 subtype). The neutralizing epitope domain COE (aa 499\u2013638) had eight different amino acids, and the epitope motif SS6 (764LQDGQVKI771) had two aa mutations between the two PEDV subtypes [19]. Based on these differences in S protein sequences, we investigated whether mutations in the S protein resulted in a change in antigenicity between strains G1 and G2.",

However, there was approximately a twofold difference in the antigenic responses based on the titers of the PAbs. Especially, the ELISA results showed that reactivity of the anti-SCV777 PAbs at different dilutions with the CV777 S protein was much greater than that with the LNCT2 S protein, indicating that the ability of anti-SCV777 PAbs to cross-react with different subtypes was lower than that of the anti-SLNCT2 PAbs. In addition, previous studies have shown that the PEDV CV777 strain induces larger syncytia than Korean strain DR13 and three US strains [36\u201338]. Comparing the IFA results of the CV777 and LNCT strains, we also found a similar phenomenon (Fig. 7). These results indicated that CV777 and epidemic strains may have differences in their ability to enter cells and induce fusion and may have different effects on cell morphology.",

Likewise, the results of the SN assay confirmed the presence of high titers of PAbs against the S protein that were able to cross-neutralize other PEDV subtypes. However, consistent with the ELISA and IFA results, there were obvious differences in serum neutralizing responses across subtypes. The SN titer of anti-SCV777 PAbs neutralizing strain CV777 was more than twofold higher than the PAbs neutralizing strain LNCT, while the differences in the neutralizing titers of anti-SLNCT2 PAbs across subtypes was less than twofold. These results indicate that the neutralizing epitopes of the LNCT2 S protein had changed or that new neutralizing epitopes had emerged due to mutations in the S protein. In the subsequent experiments, we found that the 5F7 monoclonal antibody against the LNCT S protein could react with strain LNCT, but not strain CV777 (data not shown). Further studies to identify the MAb 5F7 epitope are underway.",

Furthermore, we found significant antigenic relationships between the PEDV S protein of subtypes G1 and G2, which indicated that the CV777 vaccine could cross-protect against G2 epidemic strains, at least to some extent. However, the antigenic and serologic neutralization responses against the S protein also reflected antigenic differences of twofold between the two PEDV subtypes, based on anti-S PAbs titers. Therefore, future development of vaccines against emerging PEDV strains should involve multiple S proteins containing neutralizing epitopes from both the G1 and G2 subtypes.",
