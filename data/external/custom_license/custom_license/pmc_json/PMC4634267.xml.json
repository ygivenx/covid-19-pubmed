During the past decade, accumulated data on the impact of influenza\u2010related diseases in children have become available. The spectrum of symptoms caused by influenza viruses in children is highly divergent and may lead to the hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract disease or other complications.1 Respiratory syncytial virus has been recognized as one of the most common causes of serious lower respiratory tract infections worldwide and causes a large disease burden among infants and young children <2 years of age.2 While the greatest risk of severe disease occurs in infants and children with known high\u2010risk conditions, most infants who are hospitalized with or die of RSV\u2010related causes have no underlying medical conditions.2\n",

In some previous studies, the effects of influenza or RSV only on the consultation or hospitalization rates were analyzed separately simply by defining a week in a season as an influenza week if influenza virus predominated in virological samples or RSV week when higher percentage of RSVs were found.5, 8 This approach does not completely eliminate confounding by either RSV or other respiratory pathogens that may occur during the same period as influenza. Thus, there may be an overestimation of actual burden associated with influenza circulation in hospitalization rates reported. As shown in many studies as well as in ours, both pathogens (RSV and influenza) along with other viruses circulate concomitantly. Therefore, we did not attempt to separate the effects of influenza on hospitalizations in children aged \u22645 years from those of RSV, and we analyzed our data also for the period when both pathogens were present.",
