            "text": "BCoV infection occurs in many countries, with a high prevalence in countries where cows are kept as livestock. However, to our knowledge, molecular epidemiological analysis among epidemic BCoVs has not been reported before, except in a report from Canada [26]. Genetic analysis among domestic epidemic BCoVs has been reported recently in the United States [10], Korea [13, 17, 25], Denmark [21], and Brazil [4]. There has been no report of nationwide genetic or antigenic analysis of BCoVs in Japan. Recently, we attempted to clarify the correlation among epidemic viruses in Japan by isolating viruses from feces or nasal discharge of cattle with BCoV infections and analyzing their genes. For comparison, we used a polymorphic region (aa 456\u2013592) in the S gene [26]. We compared (1) isolates of causal viruses in 13 prefectures (148 isolates) in the period from 1999 to 2008, (2) the strain isolated from the first infection case that occurred in 1976 (Kakegawa strain) and the vaccine strain (66/H), and (3) foreign strains registered in the database. Phylogenetic analysis of the polymorphic region of the S gene grouped these strains into four clusters, which we named groups 1 to 4 [14, 15]. Group 1 included the Kakegawa and vaccine strains and foreign strains identified from the 1960s to 1970s. In 1999, most epidemic viruses in Japan belonged to group 2, but the predominant group changed to group 3 from 2002 to 2004, and viruses of group 4 have been isolated since 2004. There was no regional difference in years of incidence and groups, but it was revealed that since 2005, group 4 is the predominant lineage and the most widespread throughout Japan. Although BCoV is thought to have one serotype, its antigenicity and pathogenicity may vary among clusters; therefore, a comparative analysis of antigenicity and pathogenicity among clusters should be conducted for undertaking preventive measures against this disease. Herein, we report the results of a comparative analysis of antigenicity among bovine coronaviruses that belong to distinct groups as determined by phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, we identified the location of a neutralization antigenic site of BCoV using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) and neutralization-resistant mutants.",

All viruses except for Kakegawa and 66/H were used at low passage number (up to passage 2 or 3), because increasing viral passage cycles in cell culture may affect the antigenic composition of the virus [12]. Each of the eight virus strains was propagated in HRT-18G human rectal tumor cells and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Rabbits were inoculated subcutaneously at 2-week intervals for 6 weeks with each concentrated, purified virus strain emulsified in a 1:1 mixture with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant or incomplete adjuvant.

Our previous study revealed that group 4 is the predominant lineage and has been widespread throughout Japan since 2005. Although these recent isolates (2009\u20132012) were still clustered into group 4 (data not shown), a novel group is certain to arise in the near future due to the progression of genetic divergence in the polymorphic region of the S gene. Although BCoV is thought to have only one serotype, its antigenicity may vary among several genetic groups; thus, we conducted a comparative analysis of antigenicity among isolates belonging to each group.",

However, cross-VN testing uncovered antigenic differences among the groups, although there was no clear indication of a distinct serotype. In particular, there was a marked difference between groups 1 and 4, suggesting that the genetic differences between these groups may have altered their antigenicity. Minor antigenic differences in VN test results have been observed among BCoV isolates in the United States [33] and Japan [7]. Furthermore, Canadian isolates collected between 1987 and 1990 have been classified into three antigenic subgroups on the basis of their reactivity with a panel of mAbs [23]. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) activity of sera against Mebus also revealed antigenic differences in field isolates in the United States, which were classified into three subgroups [16]. For the serological diagnosis of BCoV, reference strains such as Mebus or Kakegawa have been used in the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and VN test. However, considering that the antigenicity will continuously change, it may not be appropriate to use these strains. Indeed, when compared to antisera against the homologous virus, bovine sera inoculated with Kumamoto/1/07 virus showed more than a fourfold reduction in VN antibody titers against Kakegawa and Ishikawa/2/99 at 24 and 29 days after inoculation, respectively (Table 3). Furthermore, antigenic differences exist, even within group 4 strains (Table 2). In brief, the antigenic relationship (R) among the four strains allowed them to be divided into two groups: (1) Kumamoto/1/07 and Hokkaido/25/05 and (2) Hokkaido/40/08 and Hokkaido/45/08. This result suggested that antigenicity may vary, even within the same genetic group, and that neutralization antigenic sites may exist in a region other than the polymorphic region used in our phylogenetic study.",

All 15 of the neutralization-resistant mutants generated by co-culture with 4H4 possessed only a single nucleotide substitution at position 851 of the S gene when compared to the sequence of the Kakegawa strain (GenBank accession no. AB354579), resulting in the alteration of the S protein at amino acid position 284 from valine to alanine. Yoo et al. reported that mAbs against the Quebec strain belonging to group 1 recognized the conformational domain consisting of domain I (aa 351\u2013403) and domain II (aa 517\u2013621); further analysis using neutralization-resistant mutants revealed that the neutralization antigenic site was at aa 528 of the S protein in the polymorphic region [35]. The antigenic site at aa 284 in our study is not located in the polymorphic region (aa 456\u2013592) nor in domain I or II; therefore, it has been suggested that this amino acid constitutes an alternate neutralization epitope compared with that of aa 528 of the Quebec strain. However, the Ishikawa/2/99, Hokkaido/12/03, and Kumamoto/1/07 strains, which were resistant to 4H4, possess a valine at aa 284, equivalent to the Kakegawa strain. This observation suggested that these viruses have amino acid alterations at the alternate site, which consists of the same neutralization epitope with aa 284, an alteration that might affect reactivity against 4H4.",

In the United States, a modified live vaccine combined with rotavirus is available in addition to inactivated vaccine. However, the preventive effects of these vaccines are uncertain [5]. Since BCoV infects and replicates in the intestinal and respiratory mucosa, it is vital to induce mucosal immunity for optimal protection. The aforementioned vaccine may be expected to induce antibodies in the blood, although the quantity that circulates to the intestinal tract is, at times, inadequate to prevent infection and replication of the virus. Therefore, the aim of vaccination for BCoV should be to prevent a severe disease requiring treatment and reduction in weight gain in infected animals [28]. These objectives may be accomplished by the selection of the optimal viral strain, whose antigenicity is close to that of the epidemic strain, as well as a vaccine program. Furthermore, BCoV causes three types of clinical symptoms, including CD, WD, and respiratory symptoms, although it is not yet apparent whether the existence of certain genetic markers correlates with the presence of different clinical symptoms. In the future, it will be important to use a viral strain for a vaccine that is protective against distinct clinical symptoms. Consequently, it is a significant task to conduct comparative analysis of antigenicity of field isolates in each country, as well as a phylogenetic study that provides us with all of the necessary epidemiological information about BCoV.",
