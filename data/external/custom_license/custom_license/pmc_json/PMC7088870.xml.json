The CD4 cell count mainly measures how active and functioning the immune systems is. When it is at most 200 cell/mm3, then the individual is immunodeficient and considered to be in the \u201cAIDS phase\u201d.

It is the biggest health problem that is hunting every part of the world which is likely to persist for a very long time. It was discovered in the early 1980\u2019s in two homosexual men in the United States of America. They were discovered with Candidiasis (a fungal infection) and a tumor called Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma respectively. The virus responsible for these infections was found out to be the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000). The virus is transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse, homosexual and bisexual sex, contaminated blood transfusion, intravenous drug use, interaction with contaminated sharp objects and other unidentified ways. Symptoms of the disease include Influenza-like sickness, fever, headache, rashes and sore throat. However, some individuals may not be aware of the illness until their situation start becoming critical (Kockaya et al. 2016).",

As a result, from 1985 to 1996 it was considered to be a single time period with a total of 617 patients, in which 57% of such patients got infected through heterosexual sex, 16.1% via intravenous drug use, 14.8% through homosexual/bisexual courtship, 10% through blood transfusion, and 1.4% was from mother to child. The National AIDS Commission was established in 1996 due to the rapid spread of the disease (Erbaydar and Eybaydar 2012). There were 708 people living with HIV/AIDS from 1997 to 2001; of which 119 newly infected individuals were recorded in 1999.",

This can be possible if patients are not being well educated on their responsibility to prevent the spread of the disease and/or are not being included in protective service studies (Morin et al. 2004). In general, HIV diagnosis is a traumatic experience that changes HIV+ person\u2019s life. This is why patients don\u2019t reveal their diagnosis at all or only reveal it to a limited number of people. It is among the strategic goal of HIV prevention to understand how and why patients hide their diagnosis and to determine possible solution to it (Miller and Rubin 2007; Anderson et al. 2009; Wolf et al. 2004). Previous studies indicated that the most common reason patients hide their diagnosis is fear of stigma and exclusion (Anderson and Walker 2010). It has also been indicated that having a family member diagnosed with HIV can affect family members in different ways (Vithayachockitikhun 2006).",

Many more studies carried out in different countries and in different cultures and religions have reported the same threat faced by the patients and their families as those in Turkey (Ramchandani et al. 2007). Due to these problems HIV/AIDS positive people normally do not register themselves in the various registration centers.

Primary purpose of any mathematical model of HIV transmission lies in using individual level inputs to project population level outcomes. Some of the important outcomes that can be examined with a model are; the incidence of infection, the prevalence of infection, or the doubling time of the epidemic. More important than these however, is simply the likelihood of an epidemic to occur that is whether there is sufficient transmission potential for a chain of infection to be sustained. This outcome is termed by a simple summary statistic: the reproduction number of the infectious process, R0. In a susceptible population, R0 represents the expected number of secondary infections generated by the first infected individual. If R0 is equal or greater than 1 an epidemic is expected. If R0 is less than 1, the infection is expected to die out.",

We found two equilibrium points, disease free and endemic equilibrium point. Global stability analysis of the equilibria was carried out by the use of Lyapunov function. Conditions of stability of both the equilibrium points were shown to depend on a threshold quantity, the basic reproduction ratio (R\n0). It was shown that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than one, the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease dies out. Also, if the basic reproduction ratio is greater than one, the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable, and epidemics occur.",

Starting from 1994 the predicted cases continue to increase rapidly and are far greater than the exact cases. This can be attributed to poor registration exercise in the country.",

In the exact values of R\n0, we noticed a fluctuation from 1985 up to 2005 and then a steady increase from 2006 to 2016. This can also be attributed to poor registration system to cover the exact HIV/AIDS cases in Turkey. However, there is stable increase in the predicted values of R\n0 over the years.

Comparing these three sets of data, which can be seen from Fig. 3, shows the flaws in the official data. The result of the analysis in this paper shows the urgent need of intervention by the relevant authorities in controlling the spread of the disease. Since in recent years, the education sector has come to play an increasingly important role in preventing HIV. Our proposal here is the use of interventions through the education sector to curtail the spread of the disease in Turkey. This is particularly because many studies in literature show that the school-based HIV/AIDS education programs provide significant changes in knowledge and attitudes that affect sexual behavior of young people. This leads to significant progress in the use of condoms and decrease in most of the sexual health problems. (Thomson et al. 1999; Kinsler 2004; Fawole et al. 1999; Kirby et al. 2007; James-Traore et al. 2004). Two element are covered by effective school-based education: training of teachers and curriculum development. A review by Kirki et al. evaluates multiple studies of such interventions and found that successful curriculum-based programs have 17 characteristics (Thomson et al. 1999). Some of these characteristics were about development of the curriculum; Some were about the curriculum itself; and the remaining were about the implementation of the curriculum (Thomson et al. 1999). After developing a curriculum, there is need for teachers to be well trained to enable them to improve students\u2019 knowledge about HIV prevention and transmission, attitudes toward HIV prevention, and behaviours relating to HIV/AIDS.",
