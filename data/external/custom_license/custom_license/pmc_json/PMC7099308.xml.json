Higher R\n0 estimates represent more efficient transmission (Fig. 1). If the R\n0 is \u02c21, then the pathogen will not infect enough people to propagate through the population.

These numbers help explain, in part, why influenza and measles have the potential to cause worldwide pandemics, while MERS-CoV caused only small clusters of illness. In the most recent outbreak, the R\n0 of Ebola virus is estimated to be between 1.5 (in Guinea) and 2.0 (in Sierra Leone) [7\u2022\u2022], although some analyses suggest an R\n0 as high as 2.5 [8].

Until recently, the epidemic potential of measles has been low because the vast majority of the population has been non-susceptible due to effective vaccination programs. Natural infection can also provide protection from repeated infections: In the case of measles, natural infection induces life-long protection. For other pathogens, such as norovirus, natural infection may only provide limited, short-term protection.",

Herd protection occurs when a large proportion of the population is immune to an infectious agent and there are inadequate numbers of susceptible hosts to propagate the infection and cause an epidemic. Herd protection does not protect a non-immune individual from disease if exposed to an infected individual. However, if the proportion of susceptible individuals in a population is very low, a large outbreak will not occur because the disease does not have the opportunity to propagate. In other words, herd protection safeguards the population but not the individual. Herd immunity occurs when live virus vaccines are used to induce immunity and these live virus vaccines are able to spread throughout the population, typically by the fecal-oral route, to infect unvaccinated individuals. When exposed to the live virus vaccine, unvaccinated individuals often develop immunity. Thus, herd immunity may protect both the individual and the population. Examples of vaccines that provide both herd protection and herd immunity are the oral polio vaccine and the oral rotavirus vaccine. Conversely, the inactivated polio vaccine provides herd protection only. Some vaccines, such as the rabies vaccine, do not confer either type of population-based protection [11].",

Thus, both the infectivity of the pathogen and the effectiveness of the vaccine come into play when determining what proportion of the population must be vaccinated to achieve herd protection. For example, assuming an R\n0 of 18, 94 % of the population must be immune to measles to achieve herd protection. The effectiveness of a single dose of measles vaccine is approximately 95 % [13]. Some individuals\u2014including very young children and the immunosuppressed\u2014are not eligible to receive vaccination. Thus, because the vaccine is not perfect, nearly 100 % of the population eligible to be immunized must be vaccinated in order to prevent measles epidemics from taking hold.",

Thus, during norovirus outbreaks, infection prevention strategies are targeted at hand hygiene, contact isolation, and specialized environmental cleaning [24]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads through small-droplet aerosols; thus, prevention programs focus on respirators for personal protection, as well as environmental controls (including hospital ventilation systems) to prevent spread. Other pathogens, such as RSV, take advantage of multiple different modes of transmission; RSV is well documented to spread both by large droplets and via contact with contaminated surfaces, followed by self-inoculation. Thus, both droplet and contact precautions are recommended to mitigate spread [25, 26].",

Furthermore, an infection risk model found that patients placed in the older, naturally ventilated rooms were at significantly lower risk of tuberculosis acquisition following exposure when compared to patients placed in mechanically ventilated rooms [35]. These findings are being translated into clinical practice in some resource-limited settings. Haiti recently christened two open-air hospitals, taking advantage of sunlight and island breezes to reduce transmission of respiratory pathogens, including tuberculosis [36].

The cause of the cluster was ultimately found to be Legionella pneumophila, which contaminated the water in cooling towers serving the convention hotel. Outbreaks and isolated cases of Legionella continue to occur in health care settings and are commonly linked to water sources [38, 39]. Given the ubiquitous nature of this organism, protecting hospital inpatients or the general population from L. pneumophila with filtering facepiece respirators (i.e., using personal protective equipment) is not a feasible prevention strategy. So, rather than targeting individuals, mitigation efforts have focused on making health care facilities inhospitable to L. pneumophila growth in water systems by maintaining temperatures that are not conducive to growth of the organism or by adding to the water oxidants such as chlorine dioxide, copper, or silver [40].",

One large cluster-randomized study examining universal use of gowns and gloves versus usual care in the intensive care unit found no reduction in their primary outcome of MRSA or VRE but did find reduced MRSA acquisition in the group with universal gloving [50\u2022]. Another investigation found a lower incidence of health-care-associated infections during a period of gown and glove use when compared to a period with glove use alone [51]. Further complicating the picture is clinical evidence suggesting that placing a large proportion of patients in contact isolation may lead to unintended consequences, including fewer health care personnel visits and increased incidence of depression, and may be associated with decreased compliance with other infection prevention measures, including hand hygiene. Thus, overuse of this strategy may paradoxically increase the incidence of health-care-associated infections and worsen clinical outcomes [52\u2022, 53, 54]. In sum, although somewhat controversial, targeted gowning and gloving to prevent the transmission of select multidrug-resistant organisms remain common clinical practices.",

The simplest and least expensive types are particulate respirators, such as the N95 respirator [57]. The chemical cartridge/gas mask respirator filters out gases and sometimes particles from inhaled air; the effectiveness of the mask for reducing exposure is dependent upon the type of filter used in the mask [57]. Some filters are designed primarily to remove particles (such as biological warfare agents) and others to remove chemicals. Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) work by using a fan to blow air through a filter and into the hood worn by the user; the same types of filters used for the gas mask respirator may also be used for the PAPR [57]. Of note, some PAPRs are designed to provide additional levels of protection, including eye coverage and skin coverage, and thus may be used to protect against not only droplet and airborne transmissions but also trans-ocular and contact-based transmissions. To obtain a similar level of protection with an N95 device, additional barriers, such as face shields, must be used in addition to the respirator.",

The tightly fitting medical mask (Kimberly Clark 47625) also demonstrated excellent performance, blocking 94.5 % of all viral particles, including greater than 91.8 % of all aerosols [61]. To simulate real-world use of the respiratory protection devices, the investigators also evaluated loosely fitting medical masks and respirators and found that loosely fitting respirators blocked greater than 69.9 % of viral particles, including almost 60 % of the virus in small particles, and that loosely fitting medical masks blocked 68.9 % of viral particles, including greater than 51.2 % of the virus contained in small particles [61].

Although personnel coming into contact with Ebola patients may not require the higher level air filtration provided by PAPRs, health care personnel at Emory reported early fogging of goggles associated with the use of an N95 mask plus eye protection and thus chose to use PAPRs not because they were needed for protection against aerosols but because of practical considerations [74]. Thus, real-world implementation obstacles may require infection prevention programs to override the theoretical minimum barrier for prevention, to develop a platform that is functional at the bedside.",
