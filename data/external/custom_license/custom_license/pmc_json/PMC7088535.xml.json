Perturbations of ER homeostasis lead to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, thus triggering ER stress. To restore the ER homeostasis, adaptive signaling cascade known as unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. Among the three UPR branches, inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) is the most sensitive arm. As we have reviewed previously [1], IRE1\u03b1 functions as an intriguing cell fate switch. IRE1\u03b1 contains a kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain. The best characterized substrate for the RNase domain of IRE1\u03b1 is X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Upon ER stress, XBP1 is spliced by IRE1\u03b1, thereby generating XBP1s, an active transcription factor encoding various adaptive genes. The IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 axis exerts adaptive and pro-survival effect, while other signaling pathways such as IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2-JNK axis evoke pro-apoptotic effect.",

Influenced by the elevation or reduction of blood nutrients, ECs are very metabolically active cells. With a high amount of protein synthesis, ECs are predisposed to ER stress [2]. Stressors such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia may cause ER stress. In response, the ECs initiate UPR to promote survival. However, in the case of unresolved and sustained ER stress, the UPR can result in EC apoptosis [3, 4]. Accumulating evidence showed that ER stress-induced EC apoptosis is implicated in a variety of human diseases, including diabetes [5], atherosclerosis [6], and neurodegeneration [7]. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of ER stress-elicited EC apoptosis remain elusive. Thus, it is important to clarify the mechanisms and find potential therapeutic agents for these diseases.",

In addition, mounting evidence showed the anti-inflammatory activity of apocynin in various cells and animal models of inflammation [9, 10]. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin was demonstrated in recent studies as well. The protective role of apocynin in EC apoptosis was verified in sepsis [11], retinopathy of prematurity [12], and pulmonary hypertension [13]. Furthermore, our previous study revealed the protective effect of apocynin on heat stress-induced EC apoptosis [14]. Until now, most of the studies have attributed the protective effect of apocynin to the inhibition of NOX activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, it is noted that apocynin attenuated the increased ER stress in the remote non-infarcted myocardium after myocardial infarction in rabbits [15]. Therefore, we wonder whether apocynin protects ECs from apoptosis via the regulation of ER stress signaling.",

In order to induce ER stress in ECs, we applied thapsigargin (TG), a specific irreversible inhibitor of ER calcium-ATPase, for the following experiments. Given that JNK signaling pathway participates in ER stress-induced cell apoptosis [17], we detected the phosphorylation levels of JNK. As revealed in Fig. 1a, TG application caused a significant increase in JNK phosphorylation, while apocynin pretreatment at the concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mmol/L strongly mitigated this effect. This result reveals that apocynin may protect EC from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Then, to further investigate the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin, we evaluated the cleavage of caspase 3. We found that TG evoked a significant increase in cleaved caspase 3 expression (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, apocynin pretreatment diminished this effect robustly (Fig. 1b). Subsequently, annexin V-FITC/PI staining was conducted to verify the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin. Consistent with the western blot results, TG induced an obvious increase in EC apoptosis, while apocynin significantly alleviated ER stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1c, d). Hence, these data clearly highlight the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin in ER stress-mediated EC apoptosis.",

Results showed that transfection of IRE1\u03b1 siRNA significantly reduced IRE1\u03b1 protein expression, as well as abolished apocynin-induced upregulation of IRE1\u03b1 expression (Fig. 2a). To further clarify the role of IRE1\u03b1 in APO-induced anti-apoptotic effect, expression levels of cleaved caspase 3 were detected after IRE1\u03b1 siRNA treatment. The results demonstrated that IRE1\u03b1 siRNA transfection augmented TG-induced caspase 3 cleavage and abolished apocynin-mitigated caspase 3 cleavage during ER stress, while control siRNA treatment had neither effect on TG-induced increase in cleaved caspase 3, nor on apocynin-mitigated caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 2b). To fully confirm these results, we performed the annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Consistently, IRE1\u03b1 knockdown abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of apocynin in ECs during ER stress. As revealed in Fig. 2c, d, in comparison to Control siRNA+APO+TG group, the IRE1\u03b1 siRNA+APO+TG group showed an increased level of apoptosis significantly. Taken together, these results indicate that apocynin prevents ECs from ER stress-elicited apoptosis, and that this effect is at least partly dependent on IRE1\u03b1.",

Then, protein expression levels of IRE1\u03b1 were determined by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3a, IRE1\u03b1 protein expression was gradually increased, reached a peak at 8 h and then slightly decreased from 16 to 24 h. Next, IRE1\u03b1 protein expression was examined in HUVECs subjected to different concentrations of apocynin for 8 h (Fig. 3b). The results showed that IRE1\u03b1 protein expression was significantly enhanced by apocynin at the concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 1 mmol/L. To further validate the effects of apocynin on IRE1\u03b1 expression, qRT-PCR assays were performed. As a result, the mRNA expression of IRE1\u03b1 was obviously increased after the application of apocynin (0.5 mmol/L) for 8 h (Fig. 3c). Hence, these results suggest that apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 in both protein and mRNA levels.",

However, when ER stress occurred, apocynin contributed to the generation of XBP1s greatly. As revealed in Fig. 4d, TG elicited a moderate degree of XBP1 splicing in HUVECs, while the application of 0.5 mmol/L apocynin in HUVECs resulted in more XBP1s production. In addition, the APO+TG group showed a significant reduction in XBP1u (the unspliced form of XBP1), compared with the TG group (Fig. 5).

Our data showed that apocynin enhanced IRE1\u03b1 expression in both protein and mRNA levels in ECs. These results suggested that IRE1\u03b1 is involved in apocynin-mediated anti-apoptotic signals. Previously, we have reviewed that IRE1\u03b1-evoked XBP1 splicing promotes cell survival [1]. Therefore, we then detected the protein and mRNA expression levels of XBP1s. Interestingly, no significant alteration of XBP1s expression was observed, neither in protein nor in mRNA levels. As we all know, TG induces ER stress and activates IRE1\u03b1, which further mediates pro-survival XBP1 splicing at the initial stage. However, if the adaptive UPR signaling pathways fail to rebalance ER homeostasis, IRE1\u03b1 may promote several pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, including regulated IRE1\u03b1-dependent decay (RIDD) and IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2 axis [1]. In the present study, we found that the degree of XBP1 splicing, characterized by an increase in XBP1s and a decrease in XBP1u, was higher in TG-stimulated ECs with apocynin pretreatment when compared with TG stimulation alone. This result can be explained that apocynin enhances IRE1\u03b1 expression and thus promotes the adaptability of ECs. Therefore, when ER stress occurs, XBP1 splicing process can be intensified in condition of the high-level IRE1\u03b1 deposit, tilting the balance of IRE1\u03b1 signaling toward EC survival. Taken together, we believe that apocynin promotes pro-survival IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 axis and thus protects ECs from ER stress-elicited apoptosis.",

Our results provide a novel mechanism explanation for the protective role of apocynin in ER stress-induced EC apoptosis. Crosstalk between ER stress and oxidative stress was evidenced in various disease processes such as cardiovascular pathology [20]. ER stress, characterized by protein misfolding, can induce ROS production and oxidative stress [21]. Likewise, oxidative stress disturbs redox homeostasis in the ER and causes ER stress. ER stress and oxidative stress can accentuate each other and activate pro-apoptosis signaling [22]. Intriguingly, additional evidence indicate that ER stress in ECs can be uncoupled from oxidative stress and that some antioxidants can alleviate oxidative stress but not ER stress [23]. Previous study showed that the activation of NOX in myocardium mediated increased ER stress, contributing to myocyte apoptosis [15]. And siRNA knockdown of the cytosolic subunit of NOX, p47phox, abrogated TG-induced apoptosis in H9C2 cells [24]. Using p47phox gene knockout mice, Maria found that NOX acts as an intermediate for ER stress in endothelial dysfunction [25]. Therefore, whether NOX is involved in the anti-apoptotic role of apocynin in ECs during ER stress remains to be identified.",

For example, the exact mechanism by which apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 is still yet to be explored in the future. It also remains to be further investigated on whether and how apocynin affects dimerization and autotransphosphorylation of IRE1\u03b1. IRE1\u03b1 exists as a monomer in basal conditions, while the luminal domain of IRE1\u03b1 undergoes dimerization upon activation. The dimerization promotes autotransphosphorylation and leads to the activation of RNase domain which is responsible for XBP1s generation. Accordingly, the detection for IRE1\u03b1 dimerization and autotransphosphorylation is important to clarify the activation behavior of IRE1\u03b1. IRE1\u03b1 dimerization can be evaluated by detecting the foci formation of IRE1\u03b1-GFP [26] and BiFC assay [27]. Recently, Amin-Wetzel et al. also established a new method to measure the endogenous IRE1\u03b1 dimerization in cells [28]. Newbatt et al. reported a DELFIA technology that is specific for detecting IRE1\u03b1 autotransphosphorylation [29]. Hopefully, we can apply some of these methods to clarify whether apocynin regulates the activation of IRE1\u03b1 directly.",

Apocynin upregulates the expression of IRE1\u03b1 and promotes IRE1\u03b1-mediated XBP1 splicing. Our findings shed light on the novel protective mechanism of apocynin, which may provide a potential pharmacologic target for ER stress-associated human diseases.",
