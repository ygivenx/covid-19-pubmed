Moreover, traditional vaccines are usually low immunogenic, because killed microorganisms cannot induce fully functioning cellular immunity. Therefore, there is a need to develop new, more effective, and less costly vaccines against swine transmissible gastroenteritis (Mout et al. 2012).",

Gold nanoparticles are stable metallic nanoparticles which have excellent surface functional chemistry, high biocompatibility, and nil toxicity. In addition, gold nanoparticles can be easily synthesized, giving them shapes such as spheres, rods, cubes, stars, and pyramids. Several reports have described the development and use of nanostructures for the delivery of biologically active agents to target cells (Mout et al. 2012; Bhattacharya and Mukherjee 2008; Staroverov et al. 2012). To reach their target cells in vivo, nanoparticles must bypass many barriers that protect animals against antigens (Dreaden et al. 2012).",

TGEV was purified in a sucrose gradient according to Horzinek et al. (1982). The resultant virus suspension was used for protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) at a constant voltage of 80 V for 20 min and then at 200 V for 3 h (Maniatis et al. 1982).

The results of protein separation were processed with the Gel-Imager and Gel Explorer, version 1.0, programs (DNA-technology, Moscow). Genome identity was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a specific primer\u2014a conservative part of TGEV\u2019s S genome, containing 886 base pairs (bp) (Herrington and McGee 1993).

The spleen framework is formed by trabeculae, which consist of reticular connective tissue, smooth muscle cells, and blood vessels (at the same time, the spleen contains only efferent lymphatic vessels). The reticular connective tissue includes both red and white pulp. The white pulp is a lymphoid tissue that produces immune and blood cells. The red pulp functions to filter blood for antigens, microorganisms, and defective red blood cells; therefore, it contains various blood corpuscles, including large and small lymphocytes, immature leucocytes, leucocytes at the final stage of graininess, and disintegrating erythrocytes. The spleen is also important for the development of humoral immunity and is a B-system organ.",

The contents of \u03b3-IFN, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates were higher than those in the intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone. The increased concentration of IL-1\u03b2 in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated.

Our research correlates with these studies but in the present work we used gold nanoparticles for the first time as a platform for antigen for TGEV. Also, we did nonspecific adsorption of the antigen and did not perform a chemical surface functionalization. This made it possible to simplify the conjugation process, as well as to remove additional procedures related to the purification of the drug from toxic components.
