Additional TGEV-like CCoVs were reported more recently in Italy (14) and the United Kingdom (15). However, full biological and molecular characterization was carried out only for the isolates from Italy, showing that the TGEV-like strains are likely recombinant with TGEV at the level of the 5\u2032 end of the spike gene (14). Experimental infection of CCoV-seronegative beagle pups showed that TGEV-like (i.e., subtype IIb) CCoV induces clinical signs resembling those of classical (i.e., subtype IIa) CCoVs, that is, mild diarrhea for a few days. (14) Unlike pantropic CCoV (11\u201313), TGEV-like CCoV was not able to spread systemically.

            "text": "Our study confirms that recombinant CCoVs are effectively circulating in dogs in different European countries. Considering the genetic distance in the spike protein, this circulation questions the efficacy of vaccines, which are based on classical (CCoV-IIa) strains, against the emerging TGEV-like (CCoV-IIb) viruses. Only vaccination trials and subsequent challenges by TGEV-like strains might assess whether the poor cross-reactivity between CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb observed in a previous study (14) might affect the immune response of dogs against the recombinant viruses.",
