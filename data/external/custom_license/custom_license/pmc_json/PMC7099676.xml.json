Although public health authorities are racing to contain the\nspread of COVID-19 around the world, the situation is still grim. About\n158 111 confirmed cases and 5946 cumulative deaths (81 059 confirmed\ncases and 3204 cumulative deaths from China) have been reported around the globe\nas of March 15, 2020. Some clinical cases have found that some carriers of the\nvirus may be asymptomatic, with no fever, and no, or only slight symptoms of\ninfection. Without the ability to screen these asymptomatic patients quickly and\neffectively, these unsuspecting carriers have the potential to increase the risk\nof disease transmission if no early effective quarantine measures are implemented.\nTherefore, to trace unknown COVID-19 sources, fast and accurate screening of\npotential virus carriers and diagnosis of asymptomatic patients is a crucial step\nfor intervention and prevention at the early stage.",
