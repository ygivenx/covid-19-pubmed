            "text": "At the core of virus replication and spread is the formation of virus\u2013host protein\ninteractions. One aspect to consider is the stark contrast between the proteomes of host\ncells and viral pathogens. The total protein complement of the genome in human cells, or\nproteome, is estimated at approximately 20,000 protein-encoding genes that, when taking into\naccount the copies per cell, can generate up to 3 million proteins per cubic micron [1,2]. Furthermore, the human proteome can\nbe further diversified by regulatory processes, including the presence of multiple\ntranscription start sites [3], alternative splicing [4\u20137], alternative mRNA polyadenylation\n[8], pre-mRNA editing [9], and\nposttranslational modifications [10,11]. Indeed, genomics studies have identified alternative splicing isoforms in up to\n60% of human genes [12,13].\nAdditionally, a large number of posttranslational modifications have been discovered that\nadd complexity and variability to the proteome [14]. The viral\nproteome can also be expanded by some of these regulatory processes. However, in contrast to\nthe human proteome, virus genomes encode far fewer proteins, ranging from 1 to approximately\n2500 that can be present in hundreds to thousands of copies per virion particle [15,16]. Therefore, even when encoding for\na small number of viral proteins, viral replication can still progress successfully by\nmaking use of dynamic interactions with the host. In fact, all viruses are obligate\nparasites and undergo evolutionarily conserved life cycles that dutifully depend on\nvirus\u2013host interactions, frequently mediated by protein\u2013protein associations.",

As an\nexample, HSV-1 is a DNA virus that employs a temporal cascade of protein expression and\ninteractions with the host (Figure 1, panels 1a\u20137a). These\nvirus\u2013host protein interactions are aimed both at ensuring successful virus replication and\nat blocking host defense mechanisms. First, virion particles bind to host cell surface\nmoieties via viral glycoproteins (Figure 1, panel 1a). The fusion\nof the virion with the cellular plasma membrane leads to the release of the viral capsid\ncontaining the genome and matrix proteins into the cytoplasm. Through associations with\ncellular motor machinery, viral capsids traverse the cytoplasm, anchor at nuclear pores, and\nextrude the double-stranded viral DNA genome into the nucleus (Figure\n1, panel 2a) [17]. Concurrently, several incoming viral\nproteins are transported to various subcellular locations to regulate viral gene expression,\nas well as to inhibit cellular intrinsic and innate immune responses [18,19]. Within the nucleus, the expression of a highly\nregulated viral gene expression cascade is initiated and is organized into immediate-early,\nearly, and late gene expression (Figure 1, panel 3a). The host cell\nRNA polymerase is co-opted to begin transcribing viral immediate-early mRNAs. Upon\ncytoplasmic translation, immediate-early proteins are transported to the nucleus where they\nstimulate the transcription of early gene, and ultimately late gene products that are\nrequired for virion assembly. In the nucleus, immature capsids are packed with viral DNA and\nbud through the nuclear membranes, Golgi compartments, endosomes, and cell membranes to\nacquire matrix and envelope components that ultimately comprise a new fully infectious\nparticle (Figure 1, panels 4a\u20137a). Therefore, the establishment of\nvirus\u2013host and host\u2013host protein interactions that are temporally and spatially regulated is\ncritical for the progression of the virus life cycle, as well as for the modulation of host\nantiviral defenses.",

As an example, the Knipe research group analyzed the\ninteraction partners of the HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP8 in human epidermoid HEp-2\ncells [35]. By isolating ICP8-associated protein complexes at\nan early time post infection in the life cycle of HSV-1, 6.5 h post infection (hpi), they\nidentified over 50 cellular and viral proteins, including host proteins that may be\ninvolved in viral replication, chromatin remodeling, or recombination repair pathways.\nUsing a similar approach, the Knipe group subsequently identified the eukaryotic\ntranslation initiation eIF3 subunits p47 and p116, eIF4G, and poly-adenylate binding\nprotein as cellular interactors of the HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP27 in human\nepidermoid cells at 6 hpi. These results suggested that ICP27 may interfere with viral or\nhost mRNA translation [36]. These interactions highlight the\nmultiple functions that can be acquired by a protein through the formation of distinct\ninteractions during the course of a productive infection. Despite the utility of\nantibodies against viral proteins, such reagents are limited by their availability and\noftentimes lack of high affinity required for AP-MS studies in infected cells.

Furthermore, the use of a fluorescent tag allows tracking the localization of\nproteins in live cells, in parallel with the temporal regulation of virus\u2013host\ninteractions [25]. This was demonstrated for the first time by\nCristea et al. for the study of SINV protein interactions at different\ntime points of infection, in which a virus strain was constructed to express the\nnonstructural viral protein nsP3 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) [24]. Using antibodies raised against GFP, proteins co-isolating\nwith nsP3 in fibroblasts were purified on magnetic beads and subjected to MS analyses\nafter different times during infection, that is 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hpi. This study led to\nthe discovery of time-specific interactions, with the early and stable recruitment of an\nendoribonuclease (G3BP), identified at all time points assessed, and the later recruitment\nof signaling proteins (14-3-3), identified only at the late 6, 8, and 10 hpi time points\nin the SINV life cycle. One hypothesis inspired by this finding and tested in a subsequent\nstudy from the same group was that the viral interaction with G3BP may serve to attenuate\nviral polyprotein expression during early stages of infection, while late 14-3-3\nrecruitment may be necessary for host translational shutoff [37]. Overall, this highlights the inherently transient nature of protein\nassociations throughout the progression of infection.",

For\nexample, temporal interactions between HCMV virion components and host factors were used\nto predict that multiple intermediate vesicles are involved in the assembly of infectious\nparticles [43]. Using GFP-AP-MS studies in PRV infected neurons\n(neuronal growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells), the Enquist research group found that\nthe viral protein Us9 interacts with the cellular kinesin KIF1A. A PRV strain containing\nGFP-tagged Us9 was used to infect neurons for 20 h, after which neurons were lysed, and\nUs9 protein complexes were immunopurified using the anti-GFP antibody. As Us9 was known to\nbe critical for anterograde neuron-to-cell transport of virion particles [44], the authors further investigate this interaction,\ndemonstrating that KIF1A is required for the transport of viral capsid in axons and for\nthe spread of infection [42]. Similarly, GFP-AP-MS and live\ncell microscopy in HSV-1-infected primary human fibroblasts led to the discovery that the\nviral E3 ubiquitin ligase protein ICP0 does not only target host defense proteins for\nproteasome-dependent degradation, but also a viral protein, the outer tegument protein\npUL46. For this study, Lin et al. infected human fibroblasts with a\nstrain of HSV-1 that expressed GFP-tagged pUL46, and the cell lysate was collected at an\nearly and a late time of infection (6 and 14 hpi). The interaction between pUL46 and ICP0,\nobserved and validated at both time points, was further functionally characterized and\nproposed to likely act as an internal regulation of viral protein levels during the virus\nlife cycle [40].",

For example, Terhune et al. generated primary\nhuman fibroblast cell lines stably expressing the cellular histone deacetylase HDAC1\ntagged with GFP, and infected the cells with HCMV for 24 h [38]. By AP-MS, it was observed that the HDAC1-containing nucleosome remodeling and\ndeacetylase complex interacted with viral proteins pUL29/28 and pUL38. This association\nwas ultimately implicated in facilitating the production of immediate-early viral RNAs. It\nis noteworthy that the study of host protein interactions during infection does not always\nrely on the use of tagged cellular proteins. These experiments can be performed on\nendogenous proteins, when antibodies are available for efficient affinity purifications.\nFor example, the antiviral immune effector IFI16 was isolated at two early time points, 3\nand 8 hpi with HSV-1 by using a combination of monoclonal antibodies against the\nendogenous protein [18]. Based on spectral counting provided by\nthe MS analysis, the HSV-1 immediate-early transactivating protein ICP0 was determined to\nbe the most abundant viral interaction with IFI16. Further functional analyses [18] provided additional support for the current model that during\nearly stages of HSV-1 infection, ICP0 employs a virus immune evasion strategy mediated by\nprotein associations to target IFI16 for proteasome-dependent degradation. This early\nassociation inhibits the induction of IFI16-mediated intrinsic and innate immune\nresponses, thereby allowing viral replication to progress [19,47]. Highlighting the importance of this host\nprotein in defense, additional AP-MS studies have demonstrated that another herpesvirus\nhas also acquired a mechanism to inhibit IFI16 [48,49].

Additionally, AP-MS analyses frequently lead to\nthe identification of hundreds of proteins that can represent strong and weak, and direct\nand indirect associations. Sparked by the necessity to reduce the presence of non-specific\ninteractions and to focus on the strong associations, tandem affinity purification (TAP)\ntagging was developed as a method that could be integrated into AP-MS workflows. The basic\nprinciple of tandem isolation involves the tagging of a protein of interest with two\ndifferent tags, which allow the subsequent purification of the protein in two sequential\naffinity steps. Although this approach tends not to be useful for studying transient\ninteractions, which can be lost during the two-step isolation, this method can help in\nobtaining cleaner purifications in comparison to one-step isolations and for identifying\nstrong protein\u2013protein interactions. In its initial form, TAP tagging utilized a\nbi-partite fusion tag separated by a protease cleavable spacer. TAP tagging was first used\nto identify multiprotein yeast complexes in 1999 [70], and has\nsince been employed in numerous biological systems, including virus\u2013host interaction\nstudies. For example, upon transfection of human epithelial cells (HeLa) with the\nTAP-tagged viral protein EBNA1 from the herpesvirus Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), Holowaty\net al. identified a stable interaction with the cellular\ndeubiquitinating protease USP7/HAUSP [71].

The discovered EBNA1-USP7 interaction was confirmed by\nco-immunoprecipitation in insect cells, which additionally demonstrated that the\nEBNA1-USP7 interaction does not require other human proteins. Subsequent functional assays\nfurther suggested that the virus may sequester USP7 indirectly to inhibit host-induced\napoptosis and promote cell cycle growth. Based on previous knowledge that the HSV-1\nimmediate-early protein ICP0 significantly accelerates viral gene expression and also\ninteracts with cellular USP7 during infection [74\u201376], this TAP tagging technique facilitated the demonstration of a\npotentially conserved herpesviral strategy to target USP7.",

Several methods have been developed to assess direct pairwise protein\ninteractions (Figure 2B, middle panel). As early as 1996, Bartel\net al. applied a genome-wide Y2H screen on proteins from\nEscherichia coli and bacteriophage T7 to reveal 25 interactions [87]. Of these interactions, six were in complexes involved in DNA\nreplication and packaging of phage particles. In 2007, an unbiased and systematic Y2H screen\nwas implemented for the first time to investigate virus\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions\n[88]. The study generated a protein interaction network\nconsisting of 173 unique associations between herpesvirus EBV proteins and human proteins.\nOut of the 89 known EBV proteins, all or part of 85 were screened against a human spleen\ncDNA library in haploid yeast cells. The global strategy adopted by this study and others\nprovided a resource for further hypothesis-driven investigations into the functions of both\ncharacterized and poorly understood proteins during viral infection. Similarly, using a\ngenome-wide Y2H screen, de Chassey et al. discovered host components that\ncritically interacted with viral replication proteins of the single-stranded RNA virus,\nhepatitis C virus (HCV) [89]. It was determined that the viral\nnonstructural proteins NS3 and NS5A, with known roles in HCV RNA replication, had an\nabundance of associations with cellular proteins. Interestingly, NS3 and NS5A were found to\nderegulate cellular focal adhesion, which could instigate tumorigenesis and cell detachment\nfrom extracellular matrix components [89]. These findings suggest\nthat NS3 and NS5A have multifunctional roles that hijack host cellular pathways through\nvirus\u2013host protein binding. Further highlighting the versatility in Y2H applicability to\ndifferent viruses, Khadka et al. performed a systematic Y2H screen to\nidentify over 130 novel interactions between Dengue virus and human proteins using a human\nliver cDNA library [90].

Human diploid fibroblast cells,\nIMR-90, were transduced with retrovirus containing ORFs from the DNA tumor viruses. Control\ncell lines consisted of cells transduced with GFP or the SV40 large T antigen. The\nidentified associations stemmed from 54 viral and 1079 host proteins that pointed to viral\nsubtype-specificity in interactions. For example, the cellular transcriptional regulators\ncAMP-response element binding protein and EP300 were only found to associate with the E6\noncoprotein of HPV from cutaneous subtypes and not mucosal subtypes. These differences\nhighlight how various virus infections markedly alter the cellular proteome through specific\nprotein interactions that may be responsible for their pathogenesis. Similarly, TAP AP-MS\nand Y2H were used to survey interaction between viral immune modulator proteins and the\nhuman proteome [92]. Seventy viral open reading frames\nrepresenting previously identified viral immune-evasive modulators from 30 viral species\nwere selected for TAP tagging [92\u201394].\nFrom this study, researchers identified over 1600 virus\u2013host protein associations that\nhighlighted both species-specific and conserved viral immune-evasive strategies [92].

Beginning as early as\nthe 1960s, protein cross-linking has been instrumental in uncovering numerous\nprotein\u2013protein interactions [95,96].\nThis approach has been effective in capturing transient or weak intermolecular protein\ncomplexes, and gaining knowledge of intramolecular surface topologies, structural\nconformations, as well as of the interacting amino acid residues [97]. The cross-linker is a chemical reagent that contains at least two reactive\ngroups flanking a linker region. Depending on the selected reactive groups, these groups\nwill associate with particular amino acid side chains that lie spatially close to each\nother. Today, numerous chemical cross-linkers are commercially available, consisting of\nvariable linker lengths and chemical specificities to meet unique experimental needs. As an\nexample, formaldehyde crosslinking has become an integral element in numerous fundamental\nbiochemical, molecular, and cellular biological techniques, such as chromatin\nimmunoprecipitation of protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes and the fixing of cells and tissues\nfor immunocytochemical assessments of protein localization by microscopy [98]. For example, crosslinking was used to show that a host defense\nprotein oligomerizes in response to viral infection [49].\nCoupling of chemical cross-linking with MS can be used to explore protein interaction\ntopologies between the virus and the host. Upon adding cross-linking reagents, cells may\nthen be lysed for subsequent targeted AP-MS analysis, or directly digested for large-scale\ninteraction studies to identify cross-linked peptides (Figure 3,\nright panel). This method covalently links one protein to another in virus-infected cells,\nthereby preserving weak or dynamic noncovalent protein interactions. The cross-linked amino\nacid residues at the interaction interphase are subsequently identified by MS. In a prime\nexample, Chavez et al. utilized a remarkable cross-linking strategy,\nProtein Interaction Reporter technology, to generate cross-links that are cleaved within a\nmass spectrometer for the identification of interacting protein and peptide sequences [99,100]. By these means, the authors\ncross-linked proteins in a purified potato leafroll virus sample and revealed topological\ninteraction data in the virus that are required for virus\u2013plant associations and its\ntransmission across aphid vectors [100]. Advantageously, this\ntechnique addresses the challenges of incomplete cross-linking and overly noisy and complex\nspectral data that have hindered the broad application of traditional cross-linking reagents\ncoupled to MS in virology [101\u2013103]\n(Figure 3, right panel).",

An emerging technique is activity-based protein profiling, a\nchemo-proteomic approach that employs active site-directed probes to profile the\nfunctionality of enzymatically active proteins in whole proteomes [136,137]. Additionally, live cell imaging microscopy,\ntomography, and optogenetics can be further integrated with proteomics to generate\nbiological insights unattainable by individual techniques. In sum, we expect\nmulti-disciplinary studies to have a crucial impact on future discoveries in virology, with\nproteomics playing an instrumental role.",

The schematic life cycles\nare depicted for HSV-1, SINV, and HIV, respectively. (1) Virion particles\nassociate with the cellular plasma membrane by binding to host surface moieties and\nreceptors. The viral membrane fuses with the plasma membrane or enters through\nendocytosis, releasing the virion core and matrix proteins into the cytoplasm.\n(2) (a) For nuclear-replicating DNA viruses, the nucleocapsid docks at\nthe nuclear pore and ejects the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome into the nucleus.\n(b, c) For cytoplasmic-replicating RNA viruses, the virion vesicle is acidified and\nreleases RNA into the cytosolic milieu. (3) (a) Viral genomes are\ntranscribed and translated. Host RNA polymerase II is co-opted to begin transcribing\nviral immediate-early mRNAs from the nuclear dsDNA genome, of which the translated\nproteins stimulate a temporal cascade of early gene and late gene transcription. (b)\nViral RNA is directly translated and processed into RNA polymerases. (c)\nAlternatively, incoming viral reverse transcriptase reverse transcribes the RNA genome\ninto DNA, which translocates to the nucleus and is transcribed by host RNA polymerase\nII. (4-6) Viral precursor glycoproteins and membrane proteins are\ninserted into the nuclear inner and outer membranes and endoplasmic reticulum, while\nothers are transported to the Golgi apparatus for additional modifications. Mature\nglycoproteins are incorporated into the plasma membrane. (a) Immature viral cores are\npacked with viral DNA in the nucleus (a), or (b, c) RNA in the cytoplasm, and bud\nthrough membranes, Golgi compartments, and endosomes to acquire tegument proteins and\nviral lipid envelope components.

Label-free protein quantification may be\nperformed by MS/MS spectral counting or precursor ion area integration. Metabolic\nlabeling can incorporate stable \u2018Light\u2019 or \u2018Heavy\u2019 amino acids in cell culture\n(SILAC), which can be used to quantify protein interactions between two time points of\ninfection. Metabolic labeling used within the \u201cisotopic differentiation of\ninteractions as random or targeted (I-DIRT) method can determine specific and low\nabundance interactions during viral infection. Peptide abundances can be quantified at\nthe MS level, comparing the ion intensities of light and heavy peptides. Isobaric\ntagging (such as tandem mass tagging, TMT) of samples can be conducted after\nproteolysis. The digested peptides from each sample are differentially labeled with\nisobaric tags consisting of unique reporter masses. The samples are mixed together for\nMS analysis, and peptide quantification is assessed at the MS/MS level using the\nreporter ion intensities. Peptide quantitative values derived from sequences assigned\nto the same protein are used to calculate the overall relative protein abundance.\nChemical cross-linking may be incorporated into an AP-MS workflow prior to IP to\nimprove the capture of weak or transient interactions.
