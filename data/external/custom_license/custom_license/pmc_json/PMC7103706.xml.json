Furthermore, it would be desirable to assess, at the point of care, which patients are suffering from severe disease in relation to their perceived RF profile, and to use such point-of-care assessments to individualize the use of anti-infective therapy. Experience during the recent influenza pandemic has shown that influenza disease severity appears rather unpredictable, especially in young patients. Whilst the majority of adults with severe disease did have previously identifiable RFs, the majority of children affected by severe disease did not [18,19]. The expected or perceived risk of severe outcomes may also influence a physician\u2019s decision to test a patient for influenza and other respiratory viruses [20]. There is little consensus on which symptoms should trigger a physician\u2019s suspicion, and local practices differ significantly from site to site and from season to season [19,21\u201324].",

CP detection therefore identifies those time points, when time series trends start differing significantly from previous data.

The linkage of simultaneous virus surveillance with point-of-care disease severity assessments will advance the understanding of local epidemiology. Local epidemiology is key to understanding the impact of different strains on different populations. In North America, influenza A H3N2 viruses reappeared 1 year sooner than in Europe, i.e. in 2010/11 [159] followed by an unusually \u2018light\u2019 season with few or late cases during the winter of 2011/12 [160]. Public health agencies in the UK reported a particularly \u2018severe\u2019 season in 2010/11 [161,162], whereas Australia reported increased rates of severe influenza disease in 2014 [163\u2013165], similar to Mexico during 2013/14. Classically, seasons have been regarded as \u2018severe\u2019 when coinciding with high overall case numbers, hospitalization rates, or mortality [166,167]. In the future, it will be important to distinguish the impact of fluctuations in influenza (sub)types on disease severity in specific patient groups, based on IPD.",

Physicians in routine care often report that their decision to order virus diagnostics is often dependent on a variety of factors such as levels of training, media attention [168,169], specific requests by patients or parents, \u2018typical\u2019 versus \u2018atypical\u2019 disease presentations, availability and cost of diagnostic tests, insurance status of the patient, time constraints, etc. [20]. The same applies to the decision to hospitalize a patient. It is safe to assume that testing and rates of hospitalization are not the same at the beginning, peak, and end of an influenza season. Standardized disease severity scores may allow hospitals to set objective thresholds for diagnostic testing or admission decisions, depending on local conditions and epidemiology.",

Influenza seasons in particular vary with respect to case numbers and disease severity attributable to various viral subtypes and population strata [67,68,113,127]. The prospective monitoring of disease severity associated with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses will help to delineate vulnerable subpopulations expressing disease severity differently compared to the population average. Real-time surveillance of disease severity may provide public health stakeholders with crucial information to adjust the allocation of hospital beds and resources [52]. The introduction of IPD disease severity assessments in a hospital-based surveillance system facilitates the timely identification of abnormal patterns of disease severity, i.e. though network analysis [176] or during time periods when the overall ILI disease severity is different from previous seasons or the rest of the year. Importantly, fluctuations in disease severity measured by the ViVI Disease Severity Score are independent of incidence-based surveillance indices.",

Additional granularity will be required for clinical trials. When the ViVI Disease Severity Score was used to follow patients longitudinally, disease severity was measured consistently from the time of initial presentation until resolution of symptoms. The ViVI Disease Severity Score has also been used to measure of subtle changes in disease severity in ICU patients requiring organ replacement therapy [40]. Once standardized scores are used consistently, this will open the path to head-to-head comparisons of antivirals and vaccines and to prospective IPD meta-analyses.",

Additional analyses are underway to understand this relationship better. Standardized disease severity measures will facilitate biomarkers studies and the identification of viral and host factors associated with severe outcomes [180]. A precision medicine approach would lead to individualized risk communication strategies to improve the acceptance of vaccines and antivirals where they are most effective. The low uptake in influenza vaccines in the QM Cohort indicates that significant numbers of symptomatic influenza cases might have been prevented through immunization [181].",

Additional decentralized studies will be needed to validate the ViVI Disease Severity Score in international settings and in private practice networks, where severity may be lower. Further studies are planned in adults and the elderly, including the development of a compatible score for patient-reported outcomes. It is possible that different populations yield different results, but standardization is the prerequisite to study any such difference. Mobile applications will be particularly useful in low-resource settings, where disease severity may be higher and decisions have to be taken instantly. Finally, the effect of antiviral treatment or vaccine prevention on disease severity could not be assessed due to a minimal use of neuraminidase inhibitors and influenza vaccines in the current setting [182]. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that physicians in this setting hardly ever used antivirals but were more likely to prescribe antibiotics if a patient appeared severely ill, as expressed in significantly higher ViVI Disease Severity Scores [30]. It will be interesting to study decision-making processes and the impact of different forms of medical interventions on disease severity in a variety of settings in the future.",
