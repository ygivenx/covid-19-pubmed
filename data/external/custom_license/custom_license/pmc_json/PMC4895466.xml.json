Intracranial pressure decreased to 2 mmHg by removal of the skull piece removed by craniotomy in the first operation, but increased to 10 mmHg when the temporalis muscle was sutured. Therefore, we placed artificial dura mater between the bilateral temporalis muscle, and ICP was decreased to 4 mmHg.

In addition, greater decompression of the ICP by relaxation of the temporalis muscle using artificial dura mater during temporalis muscle suture appeared helpful in the second operation in Case 2. In Case 1, decompression therapy may have been incomplete. The cat in Case 1 needed ventilation for a long time because cerebellar herniation was not sufficiently recovered, due to insufficient decompression of ICP.

It is common to perform midline incision over atlanto\u2010occipital joint for novel atlanto\u2010transbasioccipital approach (TBA). However reported outcome of this surgical approach always have very high mortality. So we decided to explore the possibility to perform resection of ventral brain stem meningioma by TBA through oral cavity like commonly successful hypophysectomy by transsphenoidal approach through oral cavity. The resection was performed under surgical microscope and with ultrasonic aspirator machine. MRI was taken step\u2010by\u2010step during the surgery for accuracy. Case 1 was diagnosed as papillary meningioma. Case 2 was a meningothelial meningioma. Because meningioma is always rich in nourishing blood supply and surgical field is very limited in space, resection is risky and difficult. Both patients showed residual meningioma on MRI during surgery but our goal is to remove only up to 80% of it by hollowing out. Only symptomatic treatments were sufficient for smooth recovery so no radiation and chemotherapy were provided. Case 1 patient has been surviving for 5 months and case 2 patient has been past 1.5 years post\u2010op and keeping good quality of life. Technical difficulty on TBA through oral cavity is about the same as with transsphenoidal approach. We believe that resection through oral cavity helped us to stabilize post\u2010op condition of the patients easier.",

The clinical signs most commonly reported were adipsia associated with hypernatremia (12), tremors (6) and seizures (5). Five dogs (of which 4 were Staffordshire bull terriers) were reported to have hyperkeratosis affecting the feet and nasal planum. Revision of the MR images revealed that 9 dogs had an absence of the rostral CC (in some cases a small remnant could be seen) and hypoplasia of the caudal portion whilst 5 dogs had a diffusely hypoplastic CC that was significantly reduced in length and thickness. In only 2 cases could a septum pellucidum be identified and only in 3 cases could a fornix be seen. In 13 cases, there was abnormal cortical development with fusion of the ventral frontal lobes and part of the diencephalon. In 7 dogs, a dilation of the suprapineal recess could also be identified. Four dogs were lost to follow\u2010up and 3 dogs were euthanased. The remaining 7 dogs are still alive, with a median follow\u2010up time of 20 months (range 10 \u2013 77 months after diagnosis).

Idiopathic (5 dogs) or acquired (1 dog) epilepsy was the second most common cause of SE. Seizures secondary to intracranial neoplasia caused SE in 4 dogs. The cause of SE was not determined in 3 cats and 1 dog. The dose of dexmedetomidine varied but mostly commonly was 375 mcg/m2 intramuscularly (IM) and according to the SE protocol for this practice was usually the second line agent. In 16 animals there had been a poor or unsustained response to intravenous (IV) diazepam before dexmedetomidine administration. However 10 animals received dexmedetomidine as first line therapy. For 3 animals this was because the seizure was so violent that intravenous access was not possible; IM dexmedetomidine in these animals resulted in temporary seizure cessation.

Dexmedetomidine was most successful for SE associated with pre\u2010existing epilepsy with all of the 6 dogs discharged the following day, usually with adjusted oral therapy. All 6 dogs had at least 2 injections 4 hours apart.

On histological examination, there are cerebellar cortical lesions, in particular affecting the rostral parts of the cerebellar vermis. Generally, these lesions are mild with occasional Purkinje cell (PC) gaps, rare PC degeneration, multifocal basket prominence and focal mild to moderate Bergmann gliosis. Subjectively the granular cell layer appears oligofocally thinner. Moreover a mild vacuolation of the olivary nuclei is seen. The mode of inheritance of the disease is autosomal recessive.

Lumbar myelography demonstrated extradural compression over L1\u20103 vertebral bodies. CSF Coronavirus PCR was negative. Histopathological examination revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and reactive new bone formation. Eubacterial FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) could not identify any bacteria. Case 2 is a 3 year old male neutered Persian cat with progressive paraparesis to non\u2010ambulation over 3 weeks. Skin abscesses were removed in the past. Radiography revealed shortened and fused T13\u2010L1 vertebral bodies resulted from an old spinal injury. Lumbar myelography demonstrated extensive extradural compression from T10 to L2 vertebral bodies. CSF was mildly inflammatory.

MRI revealed significant cord swelling and extradural compression in the cauda equina, and evidence of connection between the wound and the spine. A scanty growth of Sphingomonas paucimobilis was yielded from the wound. Urine, blood and CSF cultures were negative. Repeated MRI 6 days later showed reduction of the extradural lesion and cord swelling. Outcome was excellent in all cases following surgical decompression (Cases 1 and 2) and appropriate antibiosis based on culture and sensitivity tests (Cases 2 and 3).

Spinal stapling is a relatively simple surgical procedure, with minimal risk of iatrogenic damage to the spinal cord, and may act as an internal brace to minimize further angulation in young dogs or further spinal cord damage due to chronic instability in mature dogs. The presence of residual, mild neurological deficits is similar to previous reports and could be the result of associated spinal cord malformations or pre\u2010operative chronic spinal cord compression. Although these initial findings are promising, further adaptations may be required to avoid implant loosening in the long\u2010term, or to allow continued growth if used in immature dogs.",

In one non\u2010epileptic horse photic driving was detected. In conclusion, no significant differences between EEGs in epileptic and non\u2010epileptic horses could be detected in this study under Detomidine sedation despite photic stimulation.",

Abnormal findings on neurologic examination included, altered mental status ranging from depression to hyperexcitability, reduced postural reactions in all four limbs and blindness with absent menace response in both eyes. The neuroanatomic diagnosis was a forebrain lesion. An ultrasonographic study was performed through a persistent dorsal midline fontanelle. The lateral ventricles appeared enlarged and fused as a single cavity, the cortex was narrow and ring shaped and the brain was surrounded by a large quantity of anechoic fluid. Computed tomography revealed a severe dilation of lateral ventricles, widened, open fontanels were evident and between the skull and the neocortex, there was a moderate accumulation of fluid isodense to CSF considered to be an enlarged subarachnoid space. CSF analysis did not show any abnormality. Based on these findings, a presumptive diagnosis of congenital internal and external hydrocephalus was made.

Medical records from 4 institutions were retrospectively reviewed from 2006\u20102012, and 19 affected dogs were identified. Medical records of 22 dogs with brain masses and no SM were used as controls. We hypothesized that: (1) cerebellar vermis herniation predisposes to the development of SM, (2) size and localization of the brain mass, severity of edema, presence of hydrocephalus and mass effect predispose to the development of foramen magnum (FM) herniation and SM, and (3) size of the syrinx predisposes to the development of symptomatic SM. The following MRI features were assessed: presence of FM and caudal transtentorial (CTT) herniation, location of the mass, skull and mass volume, edema, mass effect and hydrocephalus. Clinical signs were scored as: (0) clinical signs referable to brain alone, (1) predominance of brain signs versus spinal cord signs (2) predominance of spinal cord signs, and (3) spinal cord signs alone. An exploratory analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors and stepwise multivariate logistic regressions were performed to confirm the variables that contributed to the risk of the positives outcomes. Foramen magnum herniation was present in 78% of dogs in the SM group and in 22% of dogs in the control group. Dogs with FM herniation had significantly increased odds of SM (odds ratio (OR=16.093, 95% C.I. = [2.690, 96.262]) and dogs with dilated 3rd ventricle had increased odds of SM (OR = 20.872, 95% C.I. = [1.556, 279.90]). Presence of CTT herniation increased the odds of FM herniation (OR = 11.225, 95% C.I. = [2.066, 60.992]). There was no association between mass location and development of SM (cranial rostral fossa, 52.3%; CCF, 47.3% of dogs with SM). Presence of moderate to severe mass effect was associated with decreased odds of spinal cord signs (OR = 0.114, 95% C.I. = [0.010, 1.356]). This study showed that the main risk factor for developing SM secondary to a brain mass is the presence of FM herniation. Presence of a dilated 3rd ventricle was also associated with development of SM in dogs with brain masses. Finally, development of SM appeared to be independent of the mass location within cranial or caudal fossa.",

The differential diagnosis included orbital cellulitis and/or retrobulbar abscess. Three days later, with topical and systemic treatment, there was an improvement in the ulcer size and exophthalmos disappeared. After one week the ulcer healed, and there was no exophthalmos or strabismus. Four days later the clinical symptom reappeared. Ocular ultrasonography was performed in the left eye, which showed a retrobulbar cyst (0.35 x 0.65 cm). After three days the dog presented blindness with bilateral mydriasis, an absent bilateral menace response, and absent direct and consensual papillary light reflexes in both eyes. The rest of the neurological examination was normal. The location of the lesion was the left optic nerve affecting the optic chiasm. The ERG was normal in both eyes. An MRI study of the neurocranium and retrobulbar space revealed a lesion on the left orbital cone. This lesion was isointense on T1\u2010weighted sequence compared with the ocular muscles and showed heterogeneous intensity on T2\u2010weighted sequences and FLAIR. The left optic tract and chiasm were hyperintense, enlarged and they produced a slight mass effect in the olfactory tubercle and piriform lobe. An increase in the muscle signal in the rostral portion of the left temporal muscle was found and a small mucus collection in the frontal sinus was also present. A severe, peripheral, irregular\u2010shaped contrast uptake was observed in the left extraconal zone. The intraconal space showed a moderate, patched, cavitary\u2010pattern contrast uptake. A moderate, homogeneous contrast enhancement pattern and irregular hallmarks were found in the brain lesions. An intense contrast uptake was seen in the muscle injuries and fronto\u2010temporal bone periosteum. The differential diagnosis included a retrobulbar abscess and/or neoplasia. The CSF analysis was normal. A fine needle cytology of the retrobulbar space showed polygonal cells with round nuclei, acidophilic cytoplasm and anisokaryosis. Five days later there was lymphadenopathy in the left submandibular lymph node. The owner decided to euthanize the animal. The necropsy confirmed the presence of a mass in the left optic nerve affecting the optic chiasm and adjacent ventral brain stem structures and piriform lobe. The mass had progressed toward the left orbital cavity infiltrating the extraocular muscles and compressing the globe eyepiece. The histological study determined the presence of a neoplastic population of an undifferentiated and highly infiltrative polygonal cell population with glial characteristics, showing malignant features, and associated with vascular proliferation phenomena. The cervical lymph node was also invaded by these neoplastic cells as described in the primary tumour. The immunohistochemistry confirmed that the majority of tumour cells were highly positive for Olig2 marker. The definitive diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma.",

During hospitalization the calf suffered a traumatic brain injury while jumping under the feeding trough. Directly after the traumatic event, the calf was unconscious for several seconds. An injection of 0.4 mg/kg dexamethasone was given intravenously from the referring veterinarian. Fifteen minutes later the calf was ambulatory, had a left sided epistaxis, reduced tongue tone and seemed apathetic. It had a bold round area in the region of the left os frontale. Haematological and biochemical analyses were within normal limits. Antibiotic and analgesic treatment was started. Two days after the trauma and initial treatment the calf was referred to the neurology unit. In the neurological examination the calf was still mildly apathetic, had a normal gait, a reduced tongue tone but was able to suckle properly. It had a mild head turn to the left and mild proprioceptive deficits on the right side. These findings were consistent with a left forebrain lesion with possible brainstem involvement. MRI obtained 6 days after the trauma was chosen over computed tomography (CT) due to the suspected caudal fossa involvement, which does not image well with CT due to a beam\u2010hardening artefact and the expected superior soft tissue detail findings in MRI. MRI revealed a closed comminuted depressed skull fracture at the level of the left os frontale, a hyperintense lesion (T2W, FLAIR and GRASE) at the level of the left frontal cortex which was heterogenous in appearance and had focal areas of hypointensity. The lesion was hypo\u2010 to isointense in T1W. These findings were consistent with an intracranial hemorrhage and closed comminuted depressed skull fracture.

In humans, most SACs are found on the posterior aspect of the spinal cord, but very rarely develop in the cervical area whereas the cervical area (C2\u2010C4) is well described particularly in Rottweilers. The distribution of the canine spinal thoracolumbar SACs, less observed, is mainly restricted to areas of high spinal mobility with some breeds described as Rhodesian Ridgebacks, Weimaraners, Shih Tzus, Shar Peis and Pugs. We carried out a retrospective study between May 2003 and April 2012 on dogs with spinal thoracolumbar subarachnoid enlargement which underwent surgical treatment.

A durotomy with a dural suspension were finally done in all dogs on the side of the hemilaminectomy. The spinal cord appeared depressed. Ventral adhesions of the dura mater to the pia mater and the arachnoid were observed in all cases. Those adhesions were not seen dorsally. Dissection of the dura mater and the arachnoid from the pia mater was done under optical magnification over the half or the 2/3 of the ventral circumference of the spinal cord until no more impediments was felt with a dental spatula all over the area. This part of the dura mater and the dura mater over the cyst were removed by durectomy. The surgery was done in a mean time of 2 hours (2\u20103 hours).

The lesion was largely surrounded by a T2 and FLAIR hyperintense signal compared to brain grey matter which was addressed as perilesional edema that involved both cerebellar hemispheres. There was a discrete pleocytosis in the CSF (9 cells/\u03bcl, ref. 0\u20103) with considerably elevated protein (0.66 g/l, ref. <0.25). The pleocytosis was of a mixed cell type with 29% neutrophils, 67% monocytes, 3% macrophages and 1% lymphocytes. Taking into account that the lesion was well demarcated, strongly contrast enhancing and that the CSF was more indicative for blood brain barrier dysfunction than inflammation, a neoplastic lesion was considered most likely. After the diagnostic imaging the cat showed marked spasticity and was unable to stand or walk. The hypothermia persisted despite treatment and bradycardia occurred. After 3 days the cat showed reduced level of consciousness and vertical nystagmus and was euthanized. Histopathological examination of the brain revealed a focal necrotising pyogranulomatous meningoencephalitis (cerebellitis) with intralesional pigmented, branching, septated hyphae. The final diagnosis was therefore fungal meningoencephalitis.",
