Respondents were unaware of their serologic status at the time of the telephone interview, which reduced the possibility for recall bias. Samples were collected and stored at \u201370\u00b0C until they were tested. Each sample was tested with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WNV enzyme immunoassay immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Reactive samples were forwarded to Health Canada's National Viral Zoonotic Laboratory in Winnipeg for plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) against West Nile, dengue, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses (3). Since our case definition relied on IgG, a positive result may have been caused by infection before the outbreak. However, the prevalence would have been low and would not likely affect our results; surveillance for WNV in Ontario began in 2000, and no positive clinical specimen was seen until the 2002 outbreak (4). The ethics review board at McMaster University approved the study.",

Initially, 1,500 persons completed the survey, but not all consented to provide a blood sample. As a result, an additional 150 persons were surveyed in April of 2003 to achieve the required sample. Of the 1,650 persons surveyed, 1,505 (91%) consented to provide a blood sample. This fraction represented 25% of persons initially contacted about the study. No significant differences were found in demographic characteristics, so the 2 groups were pooled for subsequent analysis. Because our sample did not correspond in age to the 2001 population (Table 1), we standardized our sample by using age-specific WNV seroprevalences.",

No cases of meningitis or encephalitis were seen in persons <50 years of age. Five cases of meningitis and 1 case of encephalitis were seen in persons 50\u201364 years of age; 2 cases of encephalitis were seen among those 65\u201374 years, and 3 cases of encephalitis were seen in persons >75 years. Cases were ascertained by the Halton Region Health Department, which did epidemiologic follow-up on all patients with positive WNV serologic results. If we extrapolate the 2.2%\u20134.0% range to the entire population of adults in the areas studied (30,467), an estimated 670\u20131,219 persons were infected with WNV in the L6L and L6K areas in the summer of 2002. The ratio of persons with severe illness (defined as meningitis or encephalitis) to asymptomatic or mild cases is, therefore, 1:85 (95% CI 1:60\u20131:110).",
