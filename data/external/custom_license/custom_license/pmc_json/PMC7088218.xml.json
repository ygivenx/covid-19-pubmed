Previous research showed it has a variety of functions, including participation in the transcription and replication of viral RNA, and interference with cell cycle processes of host cells [4]. Moreover, in many coronaviruses, the nucleocapsid protein has high immunogenic activity and is abundantly overexpressed during infection [5]. All of these factors suggest that the nucleocapsid protein may be a potential source of a diagnostic antigen for detecting SARS infection, and many diagnostic methods have been developed based on the nucleocapsid protein [6\u201311]. In order to develop a recombinant protein for use as the coated antigen and enzyme-conjugated antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV, we used the expression and purification of a partial nucleocapsid protein of SARS-associated coronavirus. The double-antigen sandwich assay we developed was then used to test 2892 clinical serum samples, and the results are presented here.",

Each of the 18 positive sera produced an OD between 0.354 and 2.398, all of which were greater than the cutoff point, and all 20 negative sera gave an OD below 0.15 (0.058\u00b10.030).

Analysis of these results obtained with clinical samples reveals good specificity of the ELISA. Although the percentage of samples that tested positive with the ELISA was about 70%, this may be due to the inclusion of some samples from patients who had been misdiagnosed with SARS. During the SARS outbreak, misdiagnosis occurred frequently in efforts to prevent further spread of the disease. Among the specimens from patients suspected of having SARS, some may have been collected from patients who were not actually infected. Unfortunately, it was not possible for us to follow up all of those patients and their samples, which were collected at various times during the outbreak; thus, we are not sure how many patients in this group were eventually excluded. However, the eight cases we knew were excluded and were placed in a separate group, and the ELISA produced negative results for all of these patients. ",

While the number of cases is too small for statistical analysis, our results are, to a certain extent, in accordance with the previous report [15].
