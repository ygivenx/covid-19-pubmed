            "text": "Infectious bursal disease (IBD), caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), is an acute, contagious and economically important disease in young chickens. The most obvious lesion is bursal atrophy due to IBDV infecting and destroying B cells in the bursal lymphoid follicles. Chickens infected with IBDV at less than 3 weeks of age usually do not have clinical signs but develop severe immunosuppression, which renders these chickens susceptible to secondary infections and vaccination failures [53]. IBDV is a double-stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus belonging to the family Birnaviridae [30]. The bi-segmented genome comprises segment A (~3.3 kilobase pairs [kbp]) and segment B (~2.9 kbp). Segment A encodes four viral proteins (VP), designated VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5, in two partially overlapping open reading frames. The longer open reading frame in segment A encodes a polyprotein that is further processed into mature VP2 and VP3, which are major structural proteins of the virion, and VP4, which functions as a viral protease [11]. The shorter open reading frame in segment A encodes a non-structural protein, VP5, which has been shown to induce apoptosis in chicken B cells and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) to facilitate virus dissemination [39, 54]. Segment B encodes VP1, which is both an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a structural protein that links the ends of two genome segments together [31].",

When recognizing their ligands, caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing MDA5 or RIG-I functions together with IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator (IPS-1) via CARD-CARD interaction, leading to the recruitment and activation of both canonical and non-canonical inhibitors of NF-\u03baB kinase (IKK) complexes. The canonical IKK complex mediates the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I-\u03baB), which is subsequently degraded by proteasomes. The degradation of I-\u03baB allows functional NF-\u03baB to translocate into the cell nucleus, initiating the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines [56]. On the other hand, the non-canonical IKK complex activates the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7 to form a functional homodimer or heterodimer. The functional IRF dimers enter the cell nucleus to mediate the transcription of type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 [56].",

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) is expressed in most nucleated cells and functions to present endogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells, playing an important role in alerting the immune system [50]. dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) plays a central role in the regulation of protein synthesis in virus-infected cells by catalyzing the phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (eIF-2), which results in the inhibition of translation [17]. Activation of OAS by dsRNA allows it to synthesize 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates bind to and activate RNase L, which degrades cellular and viral RNA [38]. Mx shows antiviral activity against various RNA viruses by recognizing nucleocapsid-like structures and restricting their localization within the cell [38]. The expression of the human Mx gene has been shown to provide resistance to two dsRNA viruses, including IBDV and a mammalian reovirus [32]. The chicken Mx gene was cloned and shown to confer resistance to influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infections [19].",

The PRR-PAMP innate and antiviral signaling is critical to the outcome of the infection, but information regarding the recognition of IBDV infection by PRR to induce innate immunity in chickens is limited. Understanding the interaction and underlying mechanism of innate immunity triggered by IBDV infection may shed light on the development of new approaches for protection against IBDV infection. The objective of the present study was to determine if chMDA5 senses IBDV infection, and if this recognition and interaction activates the innate immune response in chicken DF-1 cells, which are non-antigen-presenting cells (APC).",

Its DNA binding domain has been shown to bind an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) in the promoter region of the chicken Mx gene. The expression of chicken IRF-3 is induced rapidly by treatment with poly(I:C) or IFNs [8, 27]. In the present study, chicken IRF-3, along with chicken MDA5, was activated by IBDV infection in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, chicken IRF-3 was involved in the induction of IFN-\u03b2 in DF-1 cells upon IBDV infection. These findings were similar to those reported previously, showing that avian influenza virus infection activated the chicken RLR pathway, including chicken MDA5, IPS-1 and IRF-3, and mediated IFN-\u03b2 activation [25]. Taken together, IBDV infection in DF-1 cells activated the expression of chicken IFN-\u03b2 and antiviral genes, involving the MDA5 signaling pathway, including chicken IPS-1 and IRF-3.",

Similarly, the knockdown of chMDA5 in DF-1 cells significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the activation of chicken IFN-\u03b2, indicating that chMDA5 is involved in the recognition of IBDV. However, the expression levels of antiviral genes, including PKR, OAS and Mx, in the siRNA groups were not significantly lower (p > 0.05) than those in the control siRNA groups, suggesting that chMDA5 knockdown did not impact the expression of these genes. Possible explanations are as follows: 1. Some DF-1 cells may not be transfected adequately with chMDA5-targeting siRNA due to the inefficient transfection of DF-1 cells. 2. PKR and OAS are not only IFN-stimulated genes, but also dsRNA sensors [33]. Thus, PKR and OAS may be upregulated by directly sensing dsRNA derived from IBDV infection. 3. Other innate immune sensors may have a role in the activation of these antiviral genes upon IBDV infection, as has been shown in the case of avian influenza virus infection [46]. Therefore, chMDA5-mediated signaling was responsible for the recognition of IBDV and the activation of chicken IRF-3, IFN-\u03b2 and MHC class I in chicken fibroblasts infected with IBDV.",

Transfection of DF-1 cells with two chMDA5-expressing constructs induced similar levels of chMDA5 expression, while MDA5#34 induced significantly more chicken IFN-\u03b2 transcripts than MDA5#66. This suggests that pCDNA-MDA5#66 DNA is a less potent activator of chicken IFN-\u03b2 than pCDNA-MDA5#34 in DF-1 cells. Possible explanations for the lower expression of chicken IFN-\u03b2 by pCDNA-MDA5#66 may include the following: 1. The longer N-terminal segment encoded by pCDNA-MDA5#66 may interfere with the signaling by CARD-CARD interaction. 2. Although chMDA5 mRNA transcripts induced by the two DNA constructs were increased to a similar level, less chMDA5 protein was synthesized in the MDA5#66 group, probably due to a lower translation efficiency, as shown in a previous report [48].",

Similarly, lower titers of VHSV or alphavirus were shown when rainbow trout MDA5 was overexpressed in fish cells [4]. In addition, enhanced expression of fish Mx gene was demonstrated when fish MDA5 was overexpressed in fish cells [4, 35]. Consistent with previous findings, overexpression of chMDA5 limited IBDV replication in DF-1 cells in the present study.

DF-1 cells seeded in the presence of chMDA5-targeting siRNA or its control siRNA for 24 h were infected with IBDV LP1 at an MOI of 10. At 2, 8, 16 and 24 hpi, cell lysates were harvested and expression levels of chicken MDA5 (a), IPS-1 (b), IRF-3 (c), IFN-\u03b2 (d), PKR (e), OAS (f), Mx (g), and MHC class I (h) were determined by SYBR Green\u2013based real-time RT-PCR. The expression of each gene was normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) content. Expression levels are presented on a log2 scale as fold change relative to the level of control-siRNA-transfected mock-infected DF-1 cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and each bar indicates mean \u00b1 standard deviation. A significant difference between the siRNA and control siRNA groups at each time point was determined by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test and is indicated by asterisks (*)",

DF-1 cells were transfected with chicken-MDA5-expressing plasmids, pCDNA-MDA5#66 (MDA5#66 group) or pCDNA-MDA5#34 (MDA5#34 group), or pCDNA vector (vector control group) for 24 h. The chMDA5 protein encoded by pCDNA-MDA5#66 was expressed using an alternative translation initiation site and was therefore 101 amino acids longer than that encoded by pCDNA-MDA5#34 at the N-terminus. Transfected DF-1 cells were subjected to RNA extraction and SYBR Green\u2013based real-time RT-PCR. The expression levels of chicken MDA5 (a) and IFN-\u03b2 (b) are shown. The expression level of each gene was normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) content and is presented on a log2 scale as fold change relative to the level of vector-transfected DF-1 cells. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation based on triplicate samples. Different letters indicate significant difference (p < 0.05) as determined by one-way ANOVA",
