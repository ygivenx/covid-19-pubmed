The disease was initially recognized in England in 1971 [23], but the causative agent of this disease, PED virus (PEDV), was later identified in 1978 [25]. PED epidemics were first reported in Asia in 1982, and since then, PED has continued to threaten swine health, causing substantial economic losses in the Asian swine industry [4, 19, 27, 33]. In 2013, PED outbreaks suddenly occurred in the United States and have swept through the pork industry across the country, raising concerns about control measures for PED prevention [21, 30]. In Korea, PEDV appeared in 1992 [14]; however, a retrospective study indicated that the virus had been present as early as 1987 [24]. Although periodic vaccination strategies have been implemented nationwide to control PED in Korean swine herds, PEDV has continually emerged, causing tremendous harm to the productivity of Korean pig farms.",

The PEDV genome is composed of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least seven open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 6), and the 3\u2032 UTR [13]. The two large ORFs 1a and 1b make up the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome and encode the non-structural replicase genes. The remaining ORFs in the 3\u2032 terminal region code for four major structural proteins: the 150\u2013220-kDa glycosylated spike (S) protein, the 20\u201330-kDa membrane (M) protein, the 7-kDa envelope (E) protein, and the 58-kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein [8, 28].",

            "text": "The S protein of PEDV is a type I membrane glycoprotein composed of 1,383 to 1,386 amino acids (aa), depending on the strain. It contains a putative signal peptide (aa 1\u201324), a large extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain (aa 1,334\u20131,356), and a short cytoplasmic tail. Although PEDV has an uncleaved S protein because it lacks a furin cleavage site, the S protein can be divided into S1 (aa 1\u2013735) and S2 (736\u2013the last aa) domains based on homology with S proteins of other coronaviruses [7, 11, 16, 31]. Like other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is known to play a pivotal role, interacting with the cellular receptor to mediate viral entry and inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host [2, 3]. More precisely, previous studies have shown that the S1 domain includes the main neutralizing epitopes and the receptor-binding region [17, 32]. Furthermore, along with the full-length S gene, the S1 portion is known to be a suitable region for determining genetic relatedness among the different PEDV isolates and for developing differential diagnostic assays [5, 16]. Considering these molecular and biological features of the S1 domain, it would be an appropriate target for developing effective vaccines against PEDV.",

To construct the plasmids expressing S1 and its variants, the consensus sequence of PEDV S1 was identified based on a multiple alignment of the S aa sequences of PEDV field isolates [16] and utilized to synthesize a full-length, codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene (encoding aa 24\u2013735) according to a method described previously [1]. The codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene was cloned into a modified expression vector, pCDM8-Fc, which contains the CD5 signal sequence and the Fc domain of human IgG1 [9], thereby producing a human Fc-tagged fusion protein, rS1-Ig. All of the PEDV S1-truncated variants used in this study were generated using this template with the previously described primer sets [17]. An Fc-tagged PEDV rS1-Ig fragment obtained from pCDM8-Fc-rS1-Ig was then subcloned into a pFB-Neo retroviral vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the SalI and XhoI restriction sites to construct a PEDV rS1-Ig gene expression plasmid, pFB-Neo-PEDV-rS1-Ig.

A total of eight pregnant sows were obtained from a pig farm with no outbreaks or vaccination with PEDV and randomly divided into four groups of two sows. All animals were determined to be free of antibodies to PEDV. The design for the present immunogenicity study involving eight pregnant sows is outlined in Table 1. The sows in group 1 were immunized intramuscularly with attenuated PEDV live vaccine and inactivated PEDV vaccine obtained from Choongang Vaccine Laboratory, in order at 2-week intervals prior to farrowing. The pigs in group 2 were immunized intramuscularly with PEDV live vaccine and 400 \u03bcg of purified rS1-Ig resuspended in PBS in the presence of an oil-in-water adjuvant, in order at 2-week intervals before farrowing. Both the PEDV live and inactivated vaccines were administrated according to the manufacturers\u2019 manuals. The sows in group 3 and group 4 were inoculated intramuscularly three times at 2-week intervals with 400 \u03bcg of purified rS1-Ig mixed with the oil adjuvant or with cell culture medium as a negative control. Paired blood samples and colostrum were collected at 3-week intervals before farrowing and at farrowing, at delivery, respectively. One 4- to 5-day-old piglet (8 piglets in total) was selected randomly from each farrowing sow in the immunized and control groups for challenge exposure with virulent PEDV. Piglets from all groups were challenged orally with 1 ml of small intestine homogenate containing 105 TCID50/ml of PEDV field virus, equivalent to 109.8 viral genome copies per ml, determined using real-time RT-PCR as described previously [12]. Clinical signs of diarrhea and death in challenged piglets were monitored daily throughout the study. Stool samples from all groups were collected every day with 16-inch cotton-tipped swabs and subjected to RT-PCR using a TGE/PED Detection Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All piglets from the vaccinated and control groups were euthanized at 5 days after challenge for post-mortem examination. Small-intestinal tissue specimens collected from each piglet (<3 mm thick) were fixed with 10 % formalin for 24 h at RT and embedded in paraffin according to standard laboratory procedures. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 5- to 8-\u03bcm-thick sections on a microtome, floated on a 40 \u00b0C water bath containing distilled water, and transferred onto glass slides. The tissues were then deparaffinized in xylene for 5 min and washed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100, 95, 85, 70, and 50 %) for 3 min each. The deparaffinized intestinal tissues sections were subjected to immunofluorescence assay using an N-specific MAb and Alexa Fluor 594\u2013conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody as described above.\n",

Although expression of this gene could be detected in transiently transfected cells by western blot analysis, its expression level was relatively low and insufficient for further protein purification study (Fig. 1, lane 2). Thus, to enhance S1 protein expression, we first synthesized the full-length, codon-optimized S1 gene and constructed a panel of expression plasmids encoding the codon-optimized rS1-Ig (S125\u2013738) and two C-terminally truncated S1 variants: rS125\u2013543-Ig and rS125\u2013432-Ig. These constructs were independently transfected into HEK-293T cells, and expression of each construct was robustly detectable by western blot analysis using an anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Fig. 1, lanes 3 to 5), compared with a normal S1 protein (lane 2). This result indicates that codon optimization greatly increases the expression level of S1 upon transient transfection. Subsequently, to easily produce preparative amounts of the S1 protein, sublines of PK-15 cells were established to stably express the recombinant codon-optimized S1 under the control of a retroviral LTR promoter. Ten generated cell clones were initially collected and subjected to RT-PCR and western blotting to identify S1 gene expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively (data not shown). Based on the results of western blot analysis, one PK-rS1-Ig cell clone that consistently expressed the highest level of S1 was chosen for subsequent studies.\n",

As shown in Fig. 2A, specific cell staining was clearly evident when PK-rS1-Ig cells were reacted with the anti-human IgG antibody, confirming a consistent high expression level of the S1 protein. The majority of the cells consistently exhibited specific fluorescent signals, indicating a homogenous population of cells expressing S1 (Fig. 2B). Time-course western blot analysis using culture supernatants revealed that the PK-rS1-Ig cells stably express and cumulatively secrete high levels of approximately 160-kDa S1 (Fig. 2C). In addition, the overall growth kinetics of S1-gene-expressing PK-15 cells were found to be similar to those of the parental PK-15 cells, indicating that S1 expression has no effect on cell growth (data not shown). Further, the recombinant S1 protein tagged with the human IgG Fc domain expressed in the supernatants of stable PK-rS1-Ig cells was purified using protein A Sepharose beads. The purified S1 protein was detectable at a high level by Ponceau S staining, and this was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-human IgG antibody (Fig. 2D). Using our purification and concentration procedures, we were able to obtain approximately 15 \u03bcg of the S1 protein from 1 ml culture supernatant of PK-rS1-Ig cells cultivated in one well of a 6-well plate for 72 h.\n",

The antiserum collected at the second boost reacted with the purified rS1 protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, top panel), similar to the binding capacity of the anti-IgG secondary antibody, which can directly recognize the protein fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (middle panel). The antisera were found to retain nearly equivalent reactivity at the third and fourth boosts (data not shown). In contrast, the rabbit antiserum bound weakly to the authentic S protein prepared from cells infected with a PEDV vaccine strain (top panel), whereas an MAb raised against the vaccine strain reacted strongly with the authentic S protein (bottom panel). The rabbit antisera were further tested for their neutralizing activity against the PEDV SM98-1 vaccine strain, which can be grown in Vero cells in the absence of trypsin. As shown in Fig. 3B, the antisera collected at the final boost at 1:16 dilution fully protect Vero cells from SM98-1 infection (left panel), whereas pig hyperimmune sera raised against the vaccine virus were highly effective in inhibiting virus infection with neutralizing antibody titers of >1:256 (right panel). The rabbit sera at the second and third boosts possessed comparable neutralizing activities against the vaccine strain (data not shown). Taken together, our data indicated that the recombinant S1 immunogen elicits potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits. However, the rabbit antisera strongly recognized the homologous S1 protein representing the S protein of field isolates but recognized the heterologous S protein of the PEDV vaccine strain inefficiently, suggesting that there are antigenic differences between the vaccine strain and field PEDVs.\n",

Non-immunized sows showed only minimal neutralizing antibody titers, whereas immunized sows exhibited gradually increased neutralizing antibody titers, which increased considerably after the final vaccination (Fig. 4). Briefly, sows immunized with two doses of PEDV live and inactivated vaccines at 2-week intervals (group 1) had neutralizing titers of >1:256 at delivery. In contrast, sows immunized with two doses of PEDV live and S1 protein vaccines (group 2) or three doses of S1 protein vaccine (group 3) at 2-week intervals produced relatively lower neutralizing antibody titers of 1:16 to 1:32 compared to those in group 1. In addition, colostrum samples from each group were found to have neutralizing antibody titers comparable to those in the corresponding serum samples (Fig. 4B). These results were coincident with the rabbit study described above, since the rabbit antisera generated by immunization with the recombinant S1 protein also contained low levels of neutralizing antibodies to the heterologous PEDV vaccine strain.\n",

Clinical observations of death, diarrhea, and virus shedding in challenged piglets are summarized in Table 2. In the control group, one piglet died and the other piglet experienced severe watery diarrhea post-challenge. Although none of the piglets from any of the groups of immunized sows died during the challenge experiment, the number of piglets exhibiting diarrhea after challenge varied depending on the group. All piglets delivered from group 1 sows showed mild-to-severe diarrhea lasting for the entire experiment at 2 days post-challenge. In contrast, piglets from sows in groups 2 and 3 experienced only mild diarrhea for 1 or 2 days after challenge or throughout the challenge experiment. Likewise, all piglets from immunized sows (groups 1, 2, and 3) exhibited mild intestinal lesions, and viral antigens were detected only in their small intestines, whereas the majority of enterocytes over the entire villi in the control piglets (group 4) were affected by PEDV, showing moderate-to-severe villous atrophy (Fig. 5). Altogether, all immunization methods used in this study were capable of protecting passively immunized neonatal piglets against mortality and severe disease after challenge. However, immunizations involving at least one dose of PEDV S1 protein vaccine (groups 2 and 3) were more efficacious than immunization of sows with two doses of PEDV live and killed vaccines (group 1) in reducing the overall degree of diarrhea, in terms of the duration and severity, in the suckling piglets.\n\n",

            "text": "PEDV continues to have a severe economic impact in swine-raising countries in Asia and, more recently, in the United States. Vaccination against PEDV is an important and effective prevention measure. PEDV entry into host cells is mediated by the S glycoprotein on the viral surface, which interacts with the cellular receptor and induces direct membrane fusion. The PEDV S protein is also responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies in the natural host and hence is a logical target in the development of effective vaccines. Furthermore, the S1 domain is a key functional portion of the S protein, which is associated with viral binding to host-cell receptors and contains neutralizing epitopes [17, 32]. Therefore, the S1 protein of PEDV is considered to be a potential candidate antigen for vaccination attempts. In the present study, the first aim was to stably express the full-length, codon-optimized S1 gene of PEDV in porcine-origin cells and to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of the recombinant S1 protein. Our codon-optimization approach dramatically enhanced the expression level of the gene of interest upon transient transfection using a mammalian expression system. Subsequently, we were able to successfully generate a stable PK cell line continuously producing large amounts of the codon-optimized S1 protein. Following the purification and concentration processes, approximately 15\u201320 \u03bcg of the recombinant S1 protein could be consistently harvested from PK-rS1-Ig cells in each well of a 6-well plate.",

PEDV-specific antibodies were strongly detectable in rabbit sera collected from the second boost, even at the highest dilution (1:100,000), when reacted with the recombinant PEDV-S1 protein purified from S1-expressing PK-rS1-Ig cells. In contrast, the binding capacity of the antiserum was dramatically reduced when the authentic S protein in whole-cell lysates prepared from cells infected with SM98-1 was used as the antigen for western blotting. Moreover, the rabbit antisera could completely block infection of SM98-1 only at a serum dilution of 1:16, whereas the pig sera raised against SM98-1 contained high levels of neutralizing antibody against the homogeneous virus (>1:256). Since the PEDV field isolate propagated in the current culture system is unavailable to us, we were unable to test the neutralizing capacity of those antisera against the field virus in this study. However, it is conceivable that rabbit antisera directed against the S1 protein may be more effective in neutralizing infection with the field virus than with SM98-1. On the other hand, the weak interaction and neutralizing activity of the anti-S1 rabbit serum against the SM98-1 S protein may be attributed to genetic variations between the S proteins of the vaccine strain and field isolates. Indeed, the Korean field isolates, including the challenge strain used in this study, were found to display a high degree (>10 %) of genetic heterogeneity, especially in the S1 domain, compared with the PEDV vaccine strain SM98-1 [16, 18]. Nevertheless, western blot and virus neutralizing assays showed that the recombinant S1 protein efficiently elicits humoral immune responses against PEDV.",

            "text": "In Korea, several management strategies, including vaccination, have been employed to control PEDV in pig farms. The most highly recommended immunization schedule involves two doses of attenuated live and inactivated killed vaccines in gilts at 2- to 3-week intervals before mating and in pregnant sows at 12 and 14 weeks of gestation. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of this common vaccination protocol and S1 protein-based vaccination. Although all of the immunized sows developed neutralizing antibodies against SM98-1, only the sows immunized with live and killed vaccines (group 1) had high neutralizing antibody titers, ranging from 1:32 to 1:1024. However, consistent with the rabbit immunization study, sows in groups 2 and 3, immunized with at least one dose of the S1-protein-based subunit vaccine, developed weak neutralizing responses to the vaccine virus, with titers ranging from 1:8 to 1:32. Successful protection against PEDV is based on the presence of specific neutralizing antibodies in immune sows that are passively transferred to their piglets through colostrum and milk. Our data showed that, regardless of vaccination group, all neonatal piglets from immunized sows survived after challenge with virulent PEDV, suggesting that the S1 subunit vaccine provides effective lactogenic immunity to prevent mortality comparable to whole-virus-based vaccines. However, the S1-based vaccination strategies, which produced relatively low neutralizing antibody responses, exhibited more-efficient protection, with respective to the duration and severity of diarrhea, than the common live and killed vaccination procedure. It is therefore plausible that the actual levels of neutralizing antibodies raised against the S1 subunit vaccine are underestimated by the vaccine-virus-based neutralization test. Thus, improved diagnostic tools are needed to differentiate vaccinal antibodies from those resulting from natural infection with the field virus. For this purpose, the recombinant S1 protein purified from PK-rS1-Ig cells could be further used as the diagnostic antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and this aspect is currently under investigation. Additionally, it is possible that the full-length S protein may induce stronger immune responses than S1 alone because it contains multiple functional domains and neutralizing epitopes. In fact, Meng et al. [20] have recently reported that the full-length PEDV S gene induces a better immune response than the N-terminal half alone, using the recombinant DNA plasmid in a mouse model. However, production of the full-length S protein may be unachievable in our system because its expression may cause cytotoxicity due to the presence of potential fusion activity in the C-terminal portion of the S protein.",

The results presented here indicate that the recombinant S1 protein can elicit a specific antibody response and induce neutralizing antibodies, suggesting its excellent immunogenicity in the natural host. Furthermore, challenge experiments revealed that the S1-protein-based vaccine protected passively immunized suckling piglets against field PEDV. Despite the nationwide use of commercial live and killed PEDV vaccines, swine herds in Korea have continued to experience repeated outbreaks, leading swine practitioners and researchers to question their protective efficacy. Based on the present and previous studies, we hypothesize that antigenic and genetic variation between the vaccine virus and field PEDVs responsible for periodic outbreaks in herds may be the cause of the low efficacy or failure of vaccination. Accordingly, current PEDV vaccines manufactured from cell-adapted viruses should be reassessed to determine their efficacy and improved if necessary. Although further studies with a larger number of animals will be needed to better evaluate the efficacy of the S1 protein vaccine and to optimize immunization procedures, the recombinant S1 protein has potential for use in improving or developing effective and safe vaccines for PED prevention.",
