One solution is to read the corresponding journal article (if one exists) in PubMed Central [11] or from the publisher\u2019s website in order to find if a more specific location is provided.

In [13] we described and evaluated a toponym resolver, optimized for research articles linked to GenBank records. Although we achieved state-of-the-art performance for disambiguation, the performance of our toponym detection was mediocre. Based on a gazetteer and manually defined rules, our toponym detector, with a score of 0.90 recall, was able to detect most of the toponyms in each article but, with a score of 0.60 precision, was not able to discriminate ambiguous phrases, such as names of persons or animals (like \u201cturkey\u201d), from the toponyms (\u201cTurkey\u201d, the country).",

Our first approach is a toponym detector based on graphical models, namely conditional random fields (CRF). Modeling the problem of toponym detection as a sequence labeling task, and via the use of annotated data and the extraction of several useful features, we achieve significant improvements over our past work [13], with an F-score of 0.81 for the toponym class. However, the performance of this approach is limited by the size of the manually annotated data set available, which is expensive and time-consuming to prepare. Therefore, we additionally explore the use of distant supervision. Distant supervision, also known as Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU Learning) [14], is a particular learning framework where only a finite set of positive examples are known and an important quantity of unlabeled examples are available. Knowledge resources and rules are used to automatically extract additional training examples. In this study, we propose an innovative solution exploiting GenBank and distant supervision to increase the number of toponyms examples in our corpus, and discuss its possible benefits for toponym detection.",

The corpus represents a total volume of 500,000 tokens. We converted the articles from PDF to text format using a free off-the-shelf pdf converter, pdf-to-text\u2021. Two graduate students manually annotated the corpus. The students had knowledge in biology and past experiences in corpus annotation for natural language processing. Both annotators were asked to strictly follow a guideline for detecting and disambiguating the toponyms. The guideline was specially written for this task and is available for download with the corpus at http://diego.asu.edu/downloads. We randomly selected 16 articles and both annotators annotated them independently in order to compute the inter-annotator agreement. Here, we calculated the precision and recall of one annotator while holding the other as the gold standard. With a good precision and recall of 0.97 and 0.98 respectively, we found toponym detection on this corpus to be consistent between the annotators. In [13], we discuss the details of the disagreements and their reasons. The resulting corpus contains 1,881 occurrences of 379 distinct toponyms associated with their coordinates. We found the average number of occurrences of toponyms in an article to be four and the maximum number to be 264. We also identified China as the most frequent toponym with 209 occurrences in our corpus.",

CRFs have been shown to be particularly useful for structured prediction from lexical data as they take into account neighboring samples when making classification decisions. As such, CRFs have been particularly successful in natural language classification tasks, such as named entity recognition where sequential information is crucial [24, 26]. For our problem, we used the python- based CRFSuite-sklearn library [27] and explored the effects of a variety of lexical and semantic features on toponym detection performance. We randomly selected 12 documents (20%) from our annotated corpus to serve as a blind test set and used the rest of the 48 annotated documents (80%) for training and feature analysis. Toponym mentions in text can consist of single tokens (e.g., Phoenix) or multiple tokens (e.g., New York). To prepare the input data for model training, we tokenized all the text in an input document and tagged each token using the beginning, inside, outside (BIO) scheme, which is a common representation for similar sequence labeling tasks. Given an untagged token, along with selected contextual information and the generated features, the task of the supervised learner is to predict in which of the three BIO classes the token is most likely to belong. In Figure 1, we show a sample sentence and the representation used to train the CRF classifier.",

As a result, vectors of words that are conceptually similar, appear closer in vector space, compared to vectors of words that are dissimilar. We used vector representations of words learned from PubMed data [30] and applied k-means clustering [31] to group all the tokens into k groups, with each group consisting of tokens that are close together in semantic space (i.e., conceptually similar). Each of the k clusters is assigned a cluster number and, thus, each cluster number represents a set of very conceptually similar tokens. Figure 1 illustrates, for example, that \u2018China\u2019 and \u2018Korea\u2019 share the same cluster number. Names of other countries also belong to the same cluster.

For our experiment, we have analyzed the metadata of all viral sequences recorded in GenBank (the released of April 2016 contains around 2 million sequences). When reviewing a record, if the location of the infected host was provided, we checked if the article describing the sequence was contained in the PubMed Central Open Access subset\u00a7.

From the figure it can be seen that the precision of our model is not significantly affected by the size of the training data. This is because once the supervised learning algorithm is exposed to examples of locations, it is able to correctly identify them on most occasions. Recall, however, steadily improves as more training data is included. This improvement is driven by the increase in overall coverage of the training data. We fit a logarithmic trend line to the F-scores and extrapolated to forecast the performance of our classifier in the presence of additional annotated data. The trend line indicates gradual improvements even at 150% of the data. This strongly suggests that the best performance reported here, despite being significantly better than past approaches, is still below the performance ceiling and our CRF classifier is expected to benefit from the bigger set of training examples generated during our experiment with distant supervision.",

We extracted a small number of negative examples in comparison with the total number of positive examples (11,927 and 89,541 respectively). Moreover, an examination of the first 50 sentences extracted as negative examples show that, because of the construction process, the sentences tend to be short, ungrammatical and repeated. The average size of the 50 sentences was 10 words. Twelve sentences were ungrammatical because they were incorrectly segmented by our algorithm and 26 sentences were identical or followed similar patterns like \u201cClick\nhere for additional data file.\u201d and \u201cPerformed the experiments: MS JRCO ASDG\nKT\nCSD.\u201d",

Although sequence classifiers, such as a CRFs, are known to perform better on NE detection than regular classifiers [34], a sequence classifier cannot be directly trained from our set of extracted examples. The examples only reveal the labels of a partial number of words in a sentence. For example, in the sentence S1, we know that the two occurrences of Japan are toponyms, but since we have no examples for Nay1, Osaka and Matsuyama, we do not know if they are toponyms. Because a sequence classifier simultaneously labels all words of a given sentence, all labels of the words of a sentence have to be known during training. This constraint does not apply to train a regular classifier. A regular classifier labels each words independently based on the features describing the context and the word to classify. The classifier ignores all decisions it took on the previous phrases of the sentence. Consequently, we plan to train a regular classifier on our large set of examples and to run this classifier to annotate all the sentences containing at least one phrase found in GeoNames, the set A. We will use the set A annotated by our regular classifier in a future experiment to train a robust sequence classifier and will compare the performances of the sequence classifier with the performances of our current CRF trained on our training corpus.",

A NBC is fast to train on a large set of training examples and can perform well under certain conditions [35]. Our classifier categorizes all phrases that are not found in GeoNames as \u201cnot toponyms\u201d. If a phrase is found in GeoNames, to perform its classification, our classifier describes the phrases and their contexts with 18 features. These features are standard features for NE detection, such as the phrase as a string, if it starts with an uppercase, the POS tags and the string of the five words that appears before and after the phrase. To evaluate our classifier, we trained our classifier on 66% of the training examples generated with distant supervision and evaluate on the rest of the examples. We achieved 94.2% accuracy where only 1,157 toponyms and 839 non-toponyms were incorrectly labeled. Surprisingly, when we trained our classifier on the full set of the training examples generated and evaluated it on the 12 articles used to evaluate our CRF classifier in the previous experiment, the performances of our regular classifier were disappointing with a 0.66 F-score (0.52 Precision and 0.89 Recall), which was lower than our initial rule-based system. A possible explanation for this result might be the strong imbalance between the positive and negative examples in the training set. The prior probability for a phrase to be a toponym is too high causing the classifier to classify most of the phrases as \u201ctoponym\u201d despite the evidences of the features. For examples, the word Tris is a name of a toponym in GeoNames and it appears 79 times in our training examples. In all training examples Tris was an organic compound and correctly labeled as \u201cnot toponym\u201d. When evaluating on the test corpus the word Tris was found four times and always incorrectly classified as \u201ctoponym\u201d.",

Our toponym detector based on Conditional Random Fields exploits various categories of features to label jointly all toponyms occurring in a sentence. With an overall F-score of 0.81 our classifier can still be improved by providing more training examples. We proposed to use the metadata of GenBank to extract automatically a large number of examples from PubMed articles. The main limitation of this distant supervision method is the inability to train our CRF, a sequence classifier, directly from the examples extracted. Since only a subset of the toponyms occurring in a sentence is discovered, we were forced to label the unknown phrases of the sentence with a regular classifier.",

We are expecting an important improvement of the precision of our classifier without sacrificing the good recall allowed by the large coverage of GeoNames. As future work, we will balance our set of training examples by generating more negative examples based on incompatible NEs. In this study, we used the country metadata field in GenBank to find toponyms in articles. Other fields such as host, strain, species or authors can be used to extract other types of NEs with the same method. We will use the occurrences of these new NEs in the articles as new negative examples of toponyms.",
