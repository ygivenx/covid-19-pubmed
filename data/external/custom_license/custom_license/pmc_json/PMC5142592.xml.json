Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumoviruses (HMPV) are negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses and are the main causative agents of ARI in humans worldwide across all age groups [1, 14, 23]. The real challenge in treating these infections is accurate and low cost early diagnosis suitable for use in resource poor settings (http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/ivac/resources/IVAC-2015-Pneumonia-Diarrhea-Progress-Report.pdf) [18].",

However, costs for doing such tests sometimes hinder accurate clinical diagnosis due to the ever increasing number of respiratory viruses with a repertoire of causing clinically indistinguishable disease phenotype. Currently, diagnosis of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) relies on the molecular detection of viral RNA using rRT-PCR and they have overlapping clinical symptoms and are also seen to co-infect [25]. Thus we developed a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) assay for the detection of HMPV/HRSV from clinical specimens as a cost-effective alternative and compared its efficacy with established rRT-PCR. We found the newly developed mRT-PCR to have great potential for use in epidemiological vigilance and clinical diagnosis with comparable specificity and sensitivity to that of rRT-PCR [4, 8, 11, 27].",

There have been very few studies which have attempted for rapid diagnosis of respiratory viruses using multiplex PCRs [5]. Use of molecular tests in diagnosis of important respiratory viral causative agents such as HRSV/HMPV has gained wide acceptance. The diagnosis of HMPV is even tougher, as the virus is difficult to isolate in cell culture. Considering the necessity of rapid diagnosis for the clinician, virus isolation on cell culture has been replaced by molecular diagnostic tests. rRT-PCR method for reliable diagnosis of HMPV from respiratory secretions is currently the test of choice. Few studies have developed and evaluated multiplex PCR assays with the aim of providing a tool capable of detecting complete panel of known respiratory viruses [16].",

Concordance between both the methods was 100 % for HRSV A and HMPV; and 99.7 % for RSV B. There are contradictory reports on the association between HRSV and HMPV co-infection and disease severity. Some studies have found that co-infection leads to an increased rate of intensive care unit admittance, but others found no association between co-infection and disease severity [19].
