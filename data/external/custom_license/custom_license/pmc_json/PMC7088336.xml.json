The causative agent for SARS has subsequently been identified as a novel coronavirus, namely the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Drosten et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003) SARS-CoV is phylogenetically different from other members of the coronaviridae family and is the only coronavirus currently known to cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans (Lee et al. 2003). SARS-CoV encodes four main structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Rota et al. 2003; Stadler et al. 2003).",

The N protein of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) has been used as subunit vaccines to induce protective immunity and to prevent the progression of diseases in a cat model (Hohdatsu et al. 2003). In porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the N protein is a representative antigen for the T-cell response and may induce both cellular and humoral immune response (Anton et al. 1996). These results indicate that a good N protein vaccine candidate should elicit strong immune responses. Moreover, SARS-CoV N protein is highly conserved (99%) within different isolates, and shares 20\u201330% amino acid homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses (Rota et al. 2003). Thus, the N protein is an important target for SARS-CoV vaccine development.",

Antibodies against the N protein are lasting longer and occur in greater abundance in SARS patients than antibodies against other viral components such as the S, M and E proteins (Chen et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2004; Tan et al. 2004; Timani et al. 2004; Zhu et al. 2004). This phenomenon might be due to the higher expression of the N protein as compared with other viral proteins after SARS-CoV infection (Rota et al. 2003). N protein may therefore play a crucial role in antibody response during SARS-CoV infection, and might be useful in early diagnosis of the infection and for vaccine development. Moreover, vaccination with a plasmid expressing nucleocapsid protein is capable of generating strong N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice (Kim et al. 2004; Zhao et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2004). Therefore, based on these observations, we initially focused on the SARS-CoV N protein as the target antigen for our DNA vaccine development.",

            "text": "DNA vaccines induce both cellular and humoral immune responses to produce long-lasting immunity against infectious diseases. However, the low immunogenicity of DNA-based vaccines could compromise its application. In recent years, many efforts have been directed towards enhancing the immune responses elicited by DNA vaccines, including the co-expression of cytokines, the use of heterologous prime-boost regimes, and the conventional route of delivery the DNA vaccine. Several cytokines act as immunological adjuvants for inactivated and subunit vaccines as well as DNA vaccines (Barouch et al. 2002; Chow et al. 1998; Kim et al. 2000, 2001; Nobiron et al. 2001). The immune responses to DNA vaccines can be enhanced dramatically by co-administration of plasmids encoding the IL-2 gene; for example in DNA vaccination against bovine herpesvirus 1 virus (Kuhnle et al. 1996), hepatitis C virus (Geissler et al. 1997), hepatitis B virus (Chow et al. 1998), bovine viral diarrhea virus (Nobiron et al. 2001), HIV (Moore et al. 2002), foot-and-mouth disease (Wong et al. 2002), and measles virus (Premenko-Lanier et al. 2003). In our current study, we have demonstrated that IL-2 gene as a cytokine adjuvant could increase the immune responses of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine.",

            "text": "IL-2 is critical for the proliferation and clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that co-administration of plasmids encoding the IL-2 gene and a given antigen results in enhancement of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to that antigen, and mostly favors Th1 cell differentiation (Geissler et al. 1997; Kuhnle et al. 1996; Moore et al. 2002; Nobiron et al. 2001; Sin et al. 1999; Wong et al. 2002). In current study, on the basis of our examination of the immune response induced by a N DNA vaccine, we have tested the ability of IL-2 to improve the immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV N DNA vaccine. Our results clearly demonstrate that the immunogenicity of the N DNA vaccine was significantly enhanced by co-administration of an IL-2 expressing plasmid. In the studies on the antigen-specific humoral immune response of the co-immunized group, the antibody response induced by co-administration of pcDNA-N plus pcDNA-IL2 was significantly higher than that induced by vaccination with pcDNA-N alone (P < 0.05). The production of antibody induced by co-administration of the plasmids began 1 week earlier than that induced by pcDNA-N administration alone (Fig. 1). From this observation, it suggests that the antibody silent period becomes shorter when IL-2 is used as an adjuvant, this could be very helpful in the control of infection soon after SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Moreover, IL-2 is known to promote a Th1-type response and may be most useful as a vaccine adjuvant in diseases where cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in protection against pathogens (Chow et al. 1998). Published data show that the N gene plays an important role in cellular immune response of SARS-CoV infection (Kim et al. 2004; Zhao et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2004). In this study, the antigen-specific cellular immune response of T lymphocytes, and the ELISPOT assay have been employed to assess the frequency of cytokine producing cells and the kind of T cell produced in cultures of lymphocytes isolated from co-immunized mice. Our results show that immunization with pcDNA-N plus pcDNA-IL2 elicited significant levels of T-cell responses, and the response was higher than that in the pcDNA-N alone group. ELISPOT and the FACS data further confirmed this result. Using the ELISPOT assay, we measured the number of antigen-specific T-cells per million splenocytes and found that pcDNA-IL2 significantly increased the stimulated function of Th1 (as reflected by an increased release of IFN-\u03b3) and of Th2 cells (as reflected by a increased release of IL-4). There was higher level of IFN-\u03b3 production compared to IL-4 (Fig. 4), suggesting that vaccine combination induced a Th1-dominated immune response. This finding is consistent with the ability of combined vaccines to activate CD4+ and CD+ 8 T cells, with a strong CD8+ and a mild CD4+ cell increase. Thus, the present results indicate that synergistic action of IL-2 results in a strong activation of SARS-CoV N-specific Th1 lymphocytes, witnessed by a high IFN-\u03b3 production. This might be sufficient for viral clearance in animals and humans with SARS-CoV infection.",

The co-injection of the IL-2 gene during DNA immunization enhanced the development of Th1 and Th2 cells with the predominant Th1 cells. Our results are consistent with a previous report, which showed that the co-expression of the immune-stimulatory IL-2 could increase the immune response of coxsackievirus B3 principally towards Th1 (Henke et al. 2004). Conversely, Chow reported that the co-injection of the IL-2 gene during DNA immunization studies enhanced the development of Th1 cells, while the Th2 activation was not affected (Chow et al. 1998), which is in not agreement with our results. However, these different results could have been due to the different nature of the antigens used in the respective studies.",

However, the effects in mice may be more dramatic than those in humans, and there are significant limitations with the current technologies that prevent the full effectiveness of DNA vaccines in larger animals. Whether this approach could be applied to other animal models is still unknown, and its immunogenicity in humans remains to be established. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the efficacy of this SARS DNA vaccine strategy in some highly relevant translational models to demonstrate human immune responsiveness.",
