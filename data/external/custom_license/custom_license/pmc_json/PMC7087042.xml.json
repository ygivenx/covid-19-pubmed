ECoV (NC99 strain) was first isolated in the United States in 1999 from a foal with diarrhea [3]. There have been multiple outbreaks associated with ECoV at a racecourse in Japan [9, 12, 13], and in 2011\u20132012, outbreaks occurred in adult horses in the United States [14]. Recently, ECoV was detected in diarrheic and respiratory samples in Europe [8]. Fever, anorexia, lethargy, leukopenia and diarrhea were the main clinical signs observed in the horses involved in these outbreaks. ECoV is likely to be pathogenic to horses; however, experimental inoculation of horses with ECoV has not been reported to produce clinical signs of disease. An experimental model is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of ECoV. The objectives of this study were to confirm infection and to investigate the clinical course of disease and virus shedding patterns in horses experimentally inoculated with ECoV.",

The horse had watery diarrhea for 5 days prior to collection of the sample. Virus neutralization tests on paired serum samples collected from this horse showed seroconversion against ECoV. The ECoV-positive sample was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until inoculum preparation. We attempted to isolate ECoV from the sample using HRT-18G cells as described previously [12], but were unsuccessful. Prior to administration, the sample was tested for other pathogens associated with intestinal disease, including equine rotavirus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella species. Testing for equine rotavirus was performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification [10]. Previously described culture methods were used to screen for Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella species [11]. The inoculum was negative for equine rotavirus, Clostridium difficile and Salmonella species, but Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the sample. The sample was diluted 1:10 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 1000 ml of this 10 % fecal suspension was administered into the esophagus of each experimental horse using a transnasal catheter while under sedation. The suspension contained 4.2 \u00d7 109 copies/head of the ECoV nucleocapsid gene; the method used to determine copy numbers is described later in this section.",

In brief, a DNA fragment including the nucleocapsid gene was generated from viral RNA prepared from the NC99 strain by conventional RT-PCR using the primer set for ECoV-Nf and ECoV-Nr [12]. The product obtained in the first amplification was used as a template for the second amplification, which was performed using the primer pair T3-ECoV-Nf (5\u2032-attaaccctcactaaagggagaatgtctttcactcctggcaagc-3\u2032), containing the T3 promoter sequence, and ECoV-Nr. RNA was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase, and the RNA copy number was calculated from its absorbance value at 260 nm. Real-time RT-PCR was performed twice on triplicate samples of tenfold serial dilutions of control RNA (2 \u00d7 108-2 \u00d7 100 copies/4 \u03bcl). The results indicated that the real-time RT-PCR could reliably detect as few as 200 copies/reaction. In contrast, at 20 copies/reaction, only five out of six samples were positive for ECoV, and the average Ct value of the five positive samples was 36.0 cycles. Detection after 35.0 cycles is less reliable, and therefore, we decided for the purpose of this study that real-time RT-PCR could reliably detect a minimum of 200 copies/reaction. Two hundred copies per reaction corresponds to 5.0 \u00d7 105 copies per gram in feces and 5.0 \u00d7 104 copies per milliliter in nasal swabs and blood samples. All real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed in duplicate and average copy numbers were calculated.",

We previously attempted to reproduce the clinical signs of ECoV infection by experimental administration of cultured ECoVs to Thoroughbred horses but failed to induce clinical symptoms of disease [Nemoto, unpublished data]. However, BCoV is closely related to ECoV, and experimental inoculation with BCoV-positive fecal samples or intestinal contents has reproduced the clinical signs of BCoV infection in several experimental challenge studies [15\u201317]. In addition, ECoV outbreaks in Japan have been reported only in Japanese draft horses. Therefore, to reproduce the clinical signs caused by ECoV infection experimentally, we inoculated Japanese draft horses with an ECoV-positive fecal sample.",

Although Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the inoculum, it was not isolated from the fecal samples collected during the days on which the two horses showed clinical signs. This suggests that Clostridium perfringens was not related to the clinical symptoms of disease. The results of serological testing indicated that all horses were infected with ECoV; however, one horse showed no signs of illness, suggesting that subclinical ECoV infection can occur in some horses. None of the horses in this study developed severe watery diarrhea similar to that of the horse from which the inoculum was obtained. This is consistent with previous reports that diarrhea was observed in only some of the affected horses during ECoV outbreaks [12\u201314], and these findings suggest that additional factors may be associated with induction of diarrhea in ECoV-infected horses.",

White blood cell count has been shown to be closely related to clinical symptoms in horses infected with ECoV. SAA, which is used as a marker of inflammation in equine clinical practice because it closely reflects changes in clinical conditions [5], increased in the two symptomatic horses in concordance with clinical signs.

These results indicate that ECoV replicates in the intestinal tract and that feces are an important source of ECoV infection.

In addition, the virus was shed from the nasal tracts of the two horses that developed fever even after the horses became afebrile. In Europe, ECoV was also detected from a respiratory specimen within a few days after the onset of clinical signs [8]. In previous studies using field samples from the outbreaks in 2009 and 2012 [12, 13], ECoV was not detected in nasal swabs. This may be because the nasal swabs were collected during the early stages of fever development in these previous reports. As ECoV was not inoculated via the respiratory route in our current study, viral infection of the respiratory tract was probably secondary to the viremia that resulted after infection of the intestinal tract. However, in horse 3, viremia was not detected, but ECoV was isolated from nasal swabs. Therefore, we hypothesize that another route, such as lymphogenous transmission, may be related to the spread of the ECoV within the host. BCoV, which is closely related to ECoV, is transmitted to other cattle via both the respiratory and the fecal-oral route [6], and it is therefore possible that respiratory transmission of ECoV may also occur. Alternatively, it is possible that the nasal tract was secondarily infected with ECoV via exposure to feces on the floor of the stall. To clarify the route of transmission of ECoV, future virus challenge studies using respiratory tract inoculation should be performed.",
