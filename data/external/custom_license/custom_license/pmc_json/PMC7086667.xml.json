A number of suggestions were received during the voting process. These included requests to rationalize species demarcation criteria across virus families, to pay continued attention to clarity in naming new genera and to seek multiple species demarcation criteria so that new species are not created solely on the basis of a measure of nucleotide sequence identity. The ICTV continues to discuss these issues and welcomes comments on all taxonomic proposals as they are posted on the ICTV web site. The return rate of votes was approximately 48%. These taxonomic changes are now part of the official ICTV taxonomy and supplement the taxonomy presented in the Ninth ICTV Report published in 2011 [1]. An up-to-date list of all approved taxa can be found on the ICTV online web site.",
