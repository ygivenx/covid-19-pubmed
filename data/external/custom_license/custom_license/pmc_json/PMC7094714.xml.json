HSV-2 infects the human genital tract mucosa, leading to sexually transmitted diseases. Genital herpes is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases worldwide, especially in immuno-compromised population.1 And HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV infection.2, 3 Moreover, HSV-2 transmission can occur via sexual and perinatal route during asymptomatic viral shedding.3 There are several drugs licensed for the treatment of HSV infections and most of them target viral DNA polymerase. Because of the rapid emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, the development of effective therapies for HSV-caused diseases becomes more and more important, especially the development of novel therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action.",

Though great progresses have been made through this approach, it is obvious that antiviral drugs targeting viral proteins have a relatively narrow antiviral spectrum and associate with the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop new antivirals with different mechanisms of actions. Targeting a cellular protein related to virus replication is a potential alternative approach for antiviral drug development. It will generate inhibitors with broad antiviral spectrum and less likelihood of emergence of drug resistance.",

So our study in this paper focuses on GA topical treatment HSV-2 infection in mouse vaginal model. In mouse vagina model, administration of GA suspension to vagina after virus infection protected the infected mice from death and increased the average survival days and significantly reduced virus shedding from mouse vagina in a dose-dependent manner. GA effectively inhibited HSV-2 replication in mouse vaginal model by topical treatment. At the same time, GA vaginal administration groups had no effects on mice growth by weight measurement. The high-dose group of GA was up to 5.72 mg kg\u22121.",

Although cellular protein inhibitors might associate with apparent toxicities, they might be attenuated by administrating properly or reducing dosage through a combination with a viral protein-targeting drug. More importantly, target on Hsp90 may provide an antiviral approach refractory to development of drug resistance.16",
