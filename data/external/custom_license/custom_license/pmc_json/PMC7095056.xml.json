Antibodies against the virus were also found in a Chinese ferret badger (Melogale moschata) from the same market.",

A Chinese government team has since released results showing that 66 out of 508 animal handlers tested at markets in Guangdong had antibodies against the SARS virus.",

The likelihood that the virus is moving the other way \u2014 from humans to animals \u2014 is diminished by ongoing work on genetic sequences of the two viruses. These analyses suggest that the animal version has an extra stretch of 29 nucleotide bases. \u201cViruses tend not to gain stretches of nucleotides when they jump across species,\u201d says Klaus St\u00f6hr, a SARS expert at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva.",

Only six civets were present in the market, and the fact that they all had the virus suggests that they were infected recently. \u201cThey could have got it from another animal during transport to the markets,\u201d says Zhang-liang Chen, a molecular biologist and president of the China Agricultural University in Beijing. Chen's group did not find the SARS virus in samples from eight civets taken from other markets and in the wild in Guangdong.",
