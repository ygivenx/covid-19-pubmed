The order Lactobacillales contains the majority of lactic acid\u2010producing bacteria (LAB) commonly used as probiotics.4 Despite these data, the gut microbiota remains difficult to interpret because of its complexity.

Although the FDA has regulatory responsibility, the ultimate responsibility lies with the manufacturing company. The FDA only requires that supplements be labeled in a truthful and not misleading manner. Labels need to be reviewed by the CVM before marketing. The labels need to contain information to identify the feed additive and details on its safe and effective use. Expressed or implied claims that a feed additive can be used to cure, treat, or prevent disease may identify intent to offer the product as an animal drug and are not allowed. However, CVM permits the use of meaningful \u2018health\u2019 information on the label of some animal feed products. For example, \u2018gastrointestinal health\u2019 claims on horse feed fall under this policy (www.fda.gov.com).

The most commonly used genera for probiotics, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococci, are not the most abundant species in the large colon of the horse.4, 24, 27 This observation suggests that these species have less influence on the gastrointestinal health of horses. The approach of using lactobacilli or other LAB as probiotics, mainly used in humans and small animals, might be futile in horses. The focus of probiotic studies should be placed on other more abundant species.
