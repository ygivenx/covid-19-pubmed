            "text": "Coronaviruses infect a wide range of mammals and birds. Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) entry protein to bind to a cell surface receptor. Coronaviruses have zoonotic potential due to the adaptability of their S protein to receptors of other species, most notably demonstrated by SARS-CoV6, the causative agent of the SARS epidemic, which probably originated from bats7. Recently, a new coronavirus, named hCoV-EMC, has been identified in 13 patients to date with seven fatalities that suffered from severe respiratory illness, in some cases accompanied with renal dysfunction3,4,8. Genetically the virus is similar to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 and\u2014based on phylogenetic analysis using a small fragment of the virus\u2014to a bat coronavirus found in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in the Netherlands5. In recent years molecular surveillance studies revealed the existence of at least 60 novel bat coronaviruses, including some closely related to SARS-CoV9. As the human cases do not seem to originate from transmission from one source, the epidemiology of hCoV-EMC may be explained by a concealed circulation in the human population or by the repeated introduction from an intermediate animal host. For a better understanding of the biology of this novel coronavirus, timely identification of the receptor could reveal important clues to its zoonotic transmission potential and pathogenesis and to the design of possible intervention strategies. Two types of coronavirus protein receptors have been identified: the Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus uses immunoglobulin-related carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM)10 to enter cells, whereas for several Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses, two peptidases have been identified as receptors (aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) for hCoV-229E and several animal coronaviruses11,12, and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV13). In addition, sialic acid may act as a receptor for some coronaviruses14.",

Therefore we first examined whether the amino-terminal receptor-binding spike domain S1 binds to cells and investigated its correlation with cell susceptibility. We expressed the S1 domain fused to the Fc region of human IgG, yielding a recombinant disulphide-bonded dimer of approximately 280 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 1). Highly specific binding was observed to African green monkey kidney (Vero) and human liver (Huh-7) cells by immunofluorescence and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, whereas kidney cells of the P. pipistrellus bat showed intermediate staining (Fig. 1). No S1 binding was detectable to COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, no specific binding to any of these cells was observed with a feline coronavirus S1 domain, whereas feline cells (Felis catus whole fetus, FCWF) showed strong reactivity (Supplementary Table 1). Binding of hCoV-EMC S1 was shown to correlate with susceptibility to hCoV-EMC infection and with viral genome detection in the culture medium of infected cells (Fig. 1). The hCoV-EMC S1 domain was demonstrated also to bind to cells from other species but its overall reactivity was more restricted compared to that observed for SARS-CoV S1 (Supplementary Table 1).",

The hCoV-EMC S1\u2013Fc protein\u2014but not SARS-CoV S1\u2013Fc\u2014extracted a protein of \u223c110 kDa when analysed under non-reducing conditions from Huh-7 cell lysates (Fig. 2a). Mass spectrometric analysis identified this protein as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or DPP IV, also called CD26; Supplementary Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained using Vero cells (data not shown). We subsequently produced soluble (that is, non-membrane-anchored) forms of DPP4 and ACE2 and found that the hCoV-EMC S1\u2013Fc protein bound the former but not the latter, whereas the opposite was seen with the SARS S1\u2013Fc protein (Fig. 2b). Soluble DPP4, but not soluble ACE2, inhibited infection of Vero cells by hCoV-EMC (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, transient expression of human DPP4 in the non-susceptible COS-7 cells rendered these cells susceptible to binding the hCoV-EMC S1\u2013Fc protein to their surface (Supplementary Fig. 4). These data indicate a direct and specific binding of hCoV-EMC S1 to human DPP4.",

Next, we tested surface expression of DPP4 on susceptible and non-susceptible cells using a polyclonal human DPP4 antiserum. The specific reactivity of the anti-DPP4 serum with human and bat DPP4 was demonstrated by staining of human and bat DPP4-transfected cells (Fig. 3a). Expression of bat DPP4 in COS-7 cells allowed hCoV-EMC S1\u2013Fc cell surface binding (Fig. 3a). Consistent with their susceptibility to hCoV-EMC infection and with the hCoV-EMC S1 cell surface binding, Vero and Huh-7 cells expressed high levels of DPP4 on their surface as judged by antibody reactivity, bat cells displayed low-level antibody binding, whereas COS-7 cells did not show any significant binding (Fig. 3b). Thus, DPP4 cell surface expression on the cell lines was consistent with hCoV-EMC S1 cell surface binding and with susceptibility to hCoV-EMC infection. The relevance of these observations was enforced by the finding that DPP4 expression was also found in primary human bronchiolar epithelial cell cultures (Fig. 3c) and in human bronchial lung tissue (Fig. 3d), in both instances localized to the apical surfaces of non-ciliated (tubulin-IV negative) cells. In addition, hCoV-EMC infection of human bronchiolar epithelial cell cultures appeared to be localized to the non-ciliated cells that express DPP4 (Fig. 3e).",

Infection of Huh-7 cells was blocked by this serum but not by control serum or ACE2 antibodies, as evidenced by a strong reduction of virus infection, of virus excretion and of virus-induced cytopathic effects (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 7). In addition, infection of primary bronchiolar epithelial cells was blocked by the DPP4 antibodies in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4b). We next examined whether DPP4 expression confers susceptibility to hCoV-EMC infection. COS-7 cells transfected with the human DPP4 expression plasmid, but not with the empty plasmid, were efficiently infected by hCoV-EMC as demonstrated by the presence of viral non-structural proteins in the cells (Fig. 4c) and of viral RNA (Fig. 4d) and infectious virus in the cell supernatants (not shown). Likewise, expression of bat DPP4 in COS-7 cells conferred susceptibility to the virus, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 4c). Transfection of human DPP4 in non-susceptible cells of different species origin (feline, murine and canine) also permitted infection with hCoV-EMC (Supplementary Fig. 8a), whereas other human coronaviruses such as hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43 were not able to infect human DPP4-transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 8b\u2013d). Collectively, our data demonstrate that DPP4 of human and bat origin acts as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC.",

            "text": "After ACE2 and APN, DPP4 is the third exopeptidase to be discovered as a receptor for coronaviruses. DPP4 is a multifunctional 766-amino-acid-long type-II transmembrane glycoprotein presented in a dimeric form on the cell surface. It preferentially cleaves dipeptides from hormones and chemokines after a proline amino acid residue, thereby regulating their bioactivity16. Yet the use of peptidases by coronaviruses may be more related to their abundant presence on epithelial and endothelial tissues\u2014the primary tissues of coronavirus infection\u2014rather than to their proteolytic activity, which in the case of APN and ACE2 appeared not to be critical for infection12,13. Consistently, hCoV-EMC infection could not be blocked by the DPP4 inhibitors sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin or P32/98 (Supplementary Fig. 9). DPP4 also has a major role in glucose metabolism by its degradation of incretins and has been further implicated in T-cell activation, chemotaxis modulation, cell adhesion, apoptosis and regulation of tumorigenicity16,17. In humans it is primarily expressed on the epithelial cells in kidney, small intestine, liver and prostate, and on activated leukocytes, whereas it occurs as a soluble form in the circulation16,17. At present little is known about the tropism of hCoV-EMC in vivo; the virus has been detected only in upper respiratory swabs, urine, sputum and tracheal aspirate3,4. Our observation of DPP4 being expressed on non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells together with its reported expression in the kidney is consistent with clinical manifestations of hCoV-EMC infection. It is important to note that most respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV18, have a marked tropism for ciliated cells that are more widely distributed along the upper and lower respiratory tract.",

In view of the evolutionary conservation of DPP4 and the ability of hCoV-EMC to use bat DPP4 as a functional receptor, such host species switching would not be surprising. Adaptive mutations in the SARS-CoV S1 domain allowing improved binding to human ACE2 have been noted, explaining, at least in part, the zoonotic transmission event20,21.

It will be important to investigate whether and how varying soluble DPP4 levels affect hCoV-EMC pathogenesis. Downregulation of ACE2 expression after SARS-CoV infection has been shown to contribute to the severity of disease22, consistent with the protective role of soluble ACE2 in lung injury23. Given the importance of DPP4 in regulation of chemokine and cytokine responses16 one may speculate that in vivo downregulation of the hCoV-EMC receptor may potentially influence the pathogenesis of this virus. Preliminary findings in vitro, however, indicate that S1 binding to DPP4 did not result in significant downregulation of DPP4 or of the DPP4 enzymatic activity on Huh-7 cells (not shown), possibly due to the observed active recycling of DPP4 from the plasma membrane16. Manipulation of DPP4 levels or development of inhibitors that target the binding interface between the S1 domain and receptor in vivo may provide therapeutic opportunities to combat hCoV-EMC infection. In addition, future studies should address the development of effective vaccines, including those that elicit antibodies that prevent the binding of hCoV-EMC to DPP4.",

The Mascot algorithm (version 2.2; MatrixScience) was used for searching against a Uniprot database (release 2012_10.fasta, taxonomy: Homo sapiens or Chlorocebus sabaeus). The peptide tolerance was set to 10 p.p.m. and the fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.8 Da for CID spectra (LTQ-Orbitrap) or to 20 milli unified atomic mass unit (mu) for HCD (Q Exactive) spectra.
