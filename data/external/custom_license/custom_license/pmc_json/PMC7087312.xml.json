JEV infection causes a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infections to fever, encephalitis, and even death. Encephalitis caused by the infection is estimated to occur in 1 of 20 to 1000 cases [5, 12], with approximately 25 % of encephalitic patients dying and 50 % of the survivors developing permanent neurologic and/or psychiatric sequelae. The JEV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA encoding a polyprotein of approximately 3,400 amino acids that is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C], premembrane [prM] and envelope glycoprotein [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins [23]. The JEV envelope glycoprotein (53\u201355 kDa) contains two potential glycosylation sites [9] that are important for virus attachment, fusion, penetration, cell tropism, virulence and attenuation [14]. The JEV prM protein also contains one glycosylation site that is important for virus release and pathogenesis [13].",

            "text": "Griffithsin (GRFT), a plant-derived antiviral protein, is isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp. Due to its lectin activity, GRFT has been shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several enveloped viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) [16], SARS-CoV [27], and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [15]. Recombinant GRFT produced in E. coli or in the Nicotiana benthamiana expression system does not alter its potent anti-HIV activity and its safety profile compared to native GRFT [16, 17]. GRFT is a dimeric lectin with six principal binding sites that can bind to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S) and prevent virus entry into target cells [27]. Because of the presence of glycans on the JEV virion, we investigated whether GRFT displays antiviral activity against JEV infection. Here, we demonstrate that GRFT inhibits JEV entry into host cells at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, we show that the inhibition was due to the binding ability of GRFT to the glycans on JEV virions. Finally, we show that GRFT protects BALB/c mice from challenge with a lethal dose of JEV. In summary, our data establish that GRFT is an antiviral agent that is potentially applicable in the development of therapeutics against JEV or other flavivirus infections.",

Briefly, E. coli Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) were transformed with pCold-I-GRFT plasmid. A single colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml), and the culture was grown at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The cultures were diluted in 1 liter of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml) and grown to an A\n600 value of 0.8 at 37 \u00b0C. Protein expression was induced by treating the cells with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 22 \u00b0C for 18 h. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM PMSF). The cells were lysed by sonication followed by centrifugation at 9000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column (Bio-Rad). GRFT was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). GRFT was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a SuperdexTM 75 column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with PBS (10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl). The endotoxins from GRFT were removed using Detoxi-Gel Endotoxin Removing Gel gravity flow columns (Thermo Scientific). Purified GRFT was characterized by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. The concentration of GRFT was determined by Bradford assay, and GRFT was stored at -80 \u00b0C until use.",

We found that the viral genomic RNA level was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner up to 99 % reduction at 100 \u03bcg/ml of GRFT (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2E) when BHK-21 cells were incubated in the presence of premixed JEV/GRFT, suggesting that GRFT could interact directly with virus particles and thereby reduce their infectivity. We further investigated whether GRFT inhibits JEV infection by interacting with the cells. BHK-21 cells were incubated with GRFT for 1.5 h before virus infection. The result showed that preincubation of BHK-21 cells with GRFT had no significant inhibitory effect on JEV infection (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that GRFT did not interact with the receptors required for the virus entry. To determine if GRFT is effective after infection has already been established, we first inoculated the cells with the virus for 1.5 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated in the presence of GRFT for 1.5 hrs. We did not observe any changes in the level of JEV genomic RNA at 48 hpi (Fig. 2E), suggesting that GRFT acts at early steps in the life cycle of the virus. Finally, we added GRFT simultaneously with JEV in BHK-21 cells to investigate whether GRFT initiates antiviral activity immediately upon contact with JEV. As shown in Fig. 2E, GRFT inhibited JEV infection in BHK-21 cells, which is consistent with the immediate effect of GRFT on HIV-1 infection [10].",

Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of GRFT-JEV complexes with anti-GRFT polyclonal antibodies conjugated with protein-G Sepharose beads demonstrated that JEV could be co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of GRFT, but not in the absence of GRFT (Fig. 5B). These data suggested that the antiviral activity of GRFT against JEV was due to its interaction with the virus particle.\n",

In agreement with this observation, mice treated with GRFT also had reduced viral antigen load in the brain tissue as revealed by western blot analysis using anti-JEV envelope protein antibody (Fig. 6C). No virus envelope glycoprotein was detected in brain tissue of surviving mice on day 21 in the GRFT-treated group (Fig. 6C). These results showed that treatment with GRFT completely protected mice from the challenge of a lethal dose of JEV.\n",

A monomer of GRFT contains three carbohydrate-binding sites that bind to N-linked glycans on virus glycoproteins [27]. GRFT exists as a domain-swapped homodimer; it has six separate binding sites that are important for its antiviral potency [27]. Binding of GRFT to virus glycoproteins may inhibit the conformational change required for virus\u2013target cell attachment and subsequent fusion. It has been reported that there is a difference in the antiviral activity of GRFT against SARS-CoV and HIV-1, which is likely due to the differences in the binding affinity between GRFT and viral envelope glycoproteins [18]. Therefore, despite GRFT exerting its antiviral activity using similar mechanisms, the mode by which GRFT interacts with different viral glycoproteins is the main factor that influences the antiviral activity of GRFT against different viruses.",

The absence of JEV proteins in mice at day 21 postchallenge indicated that the virus is cleared over time [21], suggesting a prophylactic value of GRFT against JEV infection. An in vivo study on the antiviral activity of GRFT against HCV (a flavivirus) infection demonstrates that GRFT can delay the kinetics of infection when injected subcutaneously [15].

This indiscriminate activity of GRFT represents a challenge for developing GRFT as an antiviral agent.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the antiviral activity of GRFT against JEV infection in vitro and in vivo.
