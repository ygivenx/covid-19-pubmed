Analysis of the data from day 5 resulted in an EC50 of 1.77 \u03bcg/mL and an EC90 of 23.34 \u03bcg/mL, concentrations that are comparable with previous data (8); however, reductions in viral loads at these concentrations at other time points were negligible. Although concentrations of >50 \u03bcg/mL of chloroquine reduced viral loads by 2\u20134 logs starting on day 3, this decrease was accompanied by a high level of cytotoxicity (>50%) that was evident both in the cytotoxicity assay and microscopically resulting in poor selectivity of chloroquine.",

Reperfusion injury of the gut after EBOV disease, which would subsequently result in bacterial sepsis, has been suspected as a possible cause of death. Thus, broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs were proposed to help in this regard. In this study, no toxicity was observed in the mock-challenged group as a result of the combination treatment. This finding suggests that hamsters tolerate this dose of chloroquine. However, treatment had no effect on survival; no combination-treated or vehicle-treated groups survived, and median survival times were comparable (Figure 2, panel C).",

In the mouse model, a dose of 90 mg/kg resulted in toxicity but did not alter survival; therefore, higher concentrations of chloroquine in the mouse would not be expected to be possible. In the hamsters, this dose was already lethal on its own. In the hamster model at a lower dose (50 mg/kg) combined with doxycycline and azithromycin\u2014which together provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage, in addition to doxycycline having a small antiviral effect against EBOV\u2014survival did not change. Previous anecdotal reports of the incidental use of chloroquine in patients with filovirus infections also do not support any benefit from its use (13,14). Together, these data suggest that chloroquine is unlikely to provide any protection from EBOV infection in humans.",
