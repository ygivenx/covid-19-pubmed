Bioaerosols are generally complex mixtures that may include living organisms (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) as well as their fragments and toxins (Srikanth et al. 2008). They are generally recognized to cause various health effects such as infectious diseases, allergic reactions, and toxic manifestations (Kim and Kim 2007). Most airborne infectious diseases are caused by viruses (e.g., influenza, common colds, and measles). A few result from bacterial and fungal infection (e.g., tuberculosis and aspergillosis) (Burge 2001).",

But recently, a study reported that Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were present in indoor bioaerosol of general homes, which is considered to be one of the most common pathogens for outbreaks of food poisoning and an important cause of skin infections and invasive diseases (Lowy 1998). S. aureus is also the most prevalent cause of hospital- and community-acquired blood stream, skin and soft tissue, and lower respiratory infections (Diekema et al. 2001). Moreover, identified indoor S. aureus were particularly resistant to common antibiotics such as ampicillin, penicillin, and cefaclor (Gandara et al. 2006). Especially, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become a significant and increasing cause of nosocomial infections and one of the most prevalent pathogens worldwide, with a significant economic impact on healthcare systems (Rhee and Woo 2010).",

(2009) reported that an estimated 20 % of people were persistent carriers who remain positive for MRSA for months or years. MRSA is one of the most prevalent dermatology pathogens in hospitals and is increasingly acquired in the community (Huang and Chen 2011). MRSA is usually considered a major nosocomial pathogen. In Korea, Kwon et al. investigated 13 hospitals with more than 400 beds and 160 community residences by collecting samples including the hands and nasal cavities of doctors, nurses, guardians, patients, and residents. Of the MRSA strain, 24.3 % was isolated from the medical and community environment (Kwon et al. 2007). In this study, S. aureus were detected in 100 % of households' indoor air, and 66 % of households were positive for MRSA. S. aureus and MRSA are usually transmitted by direct person to person contact; however, routes of indirect transmission might include environmental exposure through aerosols (Davis et al. 2012). Several case reports have implicated positive home environment for MRSA as persistent sources of infection (Uhlemann et al. 2011). There are many studies for people with MRSA in hospitals and communities (Davis et al. 2012). However, until now, insufficient studies have been conducted on MRSA in residential indoor air. In this study, although we did not isolate MRSA from family members and environmental surfaces, we suggest that household indoor air contamination from MRSA might contribute to colonization of healthy family members.",

Airborne respiratory viruses are easily spread by droplets that can be inhaled directly or settle on surfaces. However, respiratory viruses are difficult to characterize in the airborne environment due to their small particle size and low concentration and the presence of a wide range of contaminants which can inhibit laboratory assays (Fabian et al. 2009). Some researchers have detected airborne respiratory viruses in the field, such as office environments, health centers, and hospital rooms (Blachere et al. 2009; Myatt et al. 2004; Tseng et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2011).",
