Currently, six coronavirus strains that are able to infect humans have been identified. Among them, alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and lineage A betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection1. In 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a lineage B betacoronavirus, was identified and infected more than 8 000 persons including nearly 800 related deaths worldwide in the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic2,3,4. Ten years later, another highly pathogenic lineage C betacoronavirus named the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 20125,6. Since its discovery, the MERS-CoV has infected 1 800 persons including 640 related deaths according to the WHO data in August, 2016. These two deadly coronaviruses have been extensively studied in epidemiology, virology, clinical features and other aspects7,8,9,10. However, there are still no approved antiviral drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent the infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "The spike (S) glycoprotein on the coronavirus envelope is responsible for host cell attachment, receptor binding, and for mediating host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection. It is synthesized as a precursor single polypeptide chain of \u223c1 300 amino acids and then cleaved by host furin-like proteases into an amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit and a carboxyl (C)-terminal S2 subunit7,11. The S1 subunit contains domains for host cell attachment by recognizing cell surface sugar molecules and binding to specific cellular receptors12,13. Therefore, the S1 subunit, especially its receptor-binding domain (RBD) is critical in determining cell tropism, host range and zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses14,15. The S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion loop and two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), which suggest a coiled helix structure of the S2 subunit7. Previous studies suggested that three S monomers assemble to form homo-trimer spikes anchoring on the outmost viral envelope16. Binding of RBD to cellular receptors triggers conformational changes in the S1 and S2 subunits, leading to the exposure of the fusion loop and its insertion into target cell membrane17. The HR1 and HR2 regions in the S glycoprotein trimer then form a six-helix bundle fusion core that bridges the viral and host cell membranes into close apposition to facilitate fusion17. For the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the RBD in the S1 subunit and the post-fusion core in the S2 subunit have been structurally and functionally studied as separate domains18,19,20,21,22,23. A previous study of the SARS-CoV virions by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reported the structure of the S glycoprotein trimers on the virion at a low resolution of 16.0 \u00c516. Recently the pre-fusion structures of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronaviruses HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein trimers were determined by cryo-EM at 4.0, 4.0 and 3.4 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively24,25,26. However, high-resolution structures of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoprotein trimers are still missing. In addition, intermediate states of the coronavirus S glycoprotein trimer are also required for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor binding and membrane fusion.",

Projected secondary structure features were clearly visible in the 2D classification analysis of the boxed particles (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). After 3D classification and refinement, four major different conformational states (conformations 1-4) were determined (Supplementary information, Figure S2A). The SARS-CoV spike has an overall mushroom-like shape. One of the conformation states is closely three-fold symmetric, whereas the other three conformation states show significant asymmetric features in the mushroom head region.

The CTD1 functions as the RBD of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, which specifically binds to the cellular receptor ACE218,28. The CTD1 is immediately followed by the CTD2 and CTD3, and the NTD is connected to the CTD1 through a long linker (residues 295-319; Figure 1A and 1B). The NTDs of MHV and HKU1 S glycoproteins are structurally similar and both adopt a galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold. The model to map correlation values are 0.86 for the MHV NTD and 0.87 for the HKU1 NTD (Supplementary information, Figure S4A and S4B). Fitting of the MHV or HKU1 NTD structure into the corresponding SARS-CoV S glycoprotein density map gave relatively low resolution to map correlation values (0.55 for MHV NTD and 0.52 for HKU1 NTD; Supplementary information, Figure S4C and S4D), indicating that the SARS-CoV NTD has different local conformations, although it may still adopt the galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold. The relatively low resolution in this region also did not allow us to perform ab initio model building of the NTD, therefore only two strands and a short \u03b1-helix were built and residues 14-260 were not included in the atomic model (Figure 1A and 1B). The \u03b1-helix-rich S2 subunit begins after the S1/S2 cleavage site at residue 667 (Figure 1A). The atomic model of the S2 subunit includes the functionally important fusion peptide (residues 798-815) and HR1 (residues 880-967; Figure 1A and 1B). The C-terminal HR2 (residues 1 154-1 183) was not built due to relatively poor density in this region (Figure 1A and 1B).",

In the symmetric conformation 1, the CTD1s in the head are all in a \u201cdown\u201d position, covering the S2 subunits in the stem (Figure 2A). The angle between the long axis of the CTD1 and its projection on the horizontal plane perpendicular to the 3-fold axis is \u223c19 degree (Figure 2A). In the conformations 2-4, two CTD1s still adopt the same \u201cdown\u201d conformation as in the conformation 1, whereas one CTD1 rotates outward to an \u201cup\u201d position and no longer covers the S2 subunit (Figure 2B-2D). The angles between the long axes of the \u201cup\u201d CTD1s and their projections on the horizontal plane have increased to 52, 64 and 70 degrees, respectively (Figure 2B-2D). Of note, the NTD and CTD2 around the rotated CTD1 do not have significant conformational changes (Supplementary information, Figure S5A). Therefore, the rotation of the CTD1 is a hinge motion around the loops connecting NTD to CTD1 and CTD1 to CTD2 that are in close proximity (Supplementary information, Figure S5B and S5C), suggesting that these two loops would play key roles in the conformational switch between the \u201cdown\u201d and \u201cup\u201d positions of CTD1. Although the position of the CTD2 is not affected within the monomer where the CTD1 adopts an \u201cup\u201d conformation, the CTD2 may become more liable to undergo conformational changes to expose the fusion loop underneath.",

We superimposed the previously determined CTD1-ACE2 complex crystal structure onto one CTD1 of the S glycoprotein trimer (Figure 3A). For conformation 1 in which all CTD1s are in the \u201cdown\u201d positions, numerous steric clashes were observed between ACE2 and the neighboring CTD1, and the volume of the steric clashes reaches 10 696 \u00c53 (Figure 3B and 3C). Therefore, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer with all its CTD1s in the \u201cdown\u201d positions would not be able to bind the cellular receptor ACE2, suggesting that the three-fold symmetric conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state of the spike. In contrast, similar structural superimpositions showed that ACE2 binds the \u201cup\u201d CTD1 well without steric clashes with other regions of the S glycoprotein trimer (Figure 3D-3F, Supplementary information, Figure S6A and S6B), suggesting that spikes with one CTD1 in the \u201cup\u201d position are able to bind receptor ACE2 and asymmetric conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding activate state of the spike. Notably, the \u201cup\u201d position of the CTD1 also exposes one of the covered S2 subunits, leaving the space for the large-scale conformational change of the S2 subunit to expose and insert the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane.",

These antibodies binds to the receptor-binding site on the CTD1, thereby directly inhibiting the engagement of ACE2 receptor. Structural superimpositions showed that these antibodies all have steric clashes with other regions of the S glycoprotein trimer in the conformation 1 state (Figure 4A-4C). In contrast, the S glycoprotein trimer conformations 2-4 would allow the antibodies to bind the \u201cup\u201d CTD1 and inhibit its interaction with the ACE2 receptor (Figure 4D-4F).

Since the discoveries of highly pathogenic SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012, most studies have been focused on the RBD (NTD or CTD1) of the S1 subunit because it binds to the host receptors and is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. Our knowledge about the structures of complete SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike trimers in pre-fusion and post-fusion states are still very limited.",

Recently reported cryo-EM structures of the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimers are similar to the conformation 1 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer in the receptor-binding inactive state, in which all three CTD1s in the S1 subunit are in \u201cdown\u201d positions (Figure 2A). The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer conformations 2-4 in the receptor-binding active state (Figure 2B-2D), in which one CTD1 is in an \u201cup\u201d position, were not observed in the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimers. The protein receptor of the HKU1 has not been identified and the NTD in the S1 subunit was shown to bind O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells32. The RBD of MHV S glycoprotein is the NTD of the S1 subunit, and structural alignment revealed that the MHV protein receptor CEACAM1a binds to the NTD in the S glycoprotein trimer without steric clashes (Supplementary information, Figure S6C)33. Therefore, the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimer may not need the prerequisite receptor-binding inactive to active state transition for receptor binding. This intrinsic receptor-binding difference among these coronavirus S glycoprotein trimers may be one of the reasons why the previous studies were not able to reveal other conformations rather than conformation 1 in the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimers. Nevertheless, the conformational change of CTD1 may still be needed for the subsequent exposure and conformational changes of the S2 subunit for membrane fusion during the infection of MHV and HKU1.",

Structural superimposition of DPP4 complexed with the CTD1 of MERS-CoV or HKU4 onto the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer also showed that the \u201cup\u201d conformation of CTD1 is required for the binding of DPP4 by these two betacoronaviruses (Supplementary information, Figure S7). Therefore, we suggest that the receptor-binding inactive to active state transition observed in the SARS-CoV spike would also occur in the spikes of other betacoronaviruses that bind to their host receptors through the CTD1. In receptor-binding inactive state, all three CTD1s in the \u201cdown\u201d positions would not allow efficient binding to receptors (Figure 5). The transition of one CTD1 from \u201cdown\u201d to \u201cup\u201d position would release the steric clashes and enable the binding of one receptor molecule (Figure 5). Whether the binding of the first receptor molecule is enough, or the binding of the second and third receptors is required to trigger conformational changes in the S1 and S2 subunit necessary for membrane fusion will be an interesting question for future studies.",

To calculate the \u201cup\u201d angles of the CTD1s (Figure 2), the horizontal plane of the S perpendicular to the 3-fold axis and the long axis of the CTD1 were generated using the UCSF Chimera \u201cdefine\u201d command and then the angle between the axis and the plane was calculated using the UCSF Chimera \u201cangle\u201d command. The overlap volumes between the fitted receptor and the S spike were also calculated using UCSF Chimera. Two atoms were considered to be overlapped if their overlap score > 0. The overlap score is defined as the sum of two VDW (van der Waals) radii minus the distance between them and minus an allowance (0.4 \u00c5) for potentially hydrogen-bonded pairs. All the overlap atoms were used for the generation of the steric clash area. The volume of the steric clashes was calculated using UCSF Chimera \u201cmeasure volume\u201d command.
