Studies using many different viral techniques have shown that up to 88% of cases of children with wheezing are associated with respiratory virus infections [1]. The detection of a respiratory virus does not mean that the child has only a viral infection. Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common bacterial coinfection that occurs in 20\u201360% of cases of different respiratory virus infections [2, 3]. The occurrences of other bacterial coinfections, sinusitis, and pneumonia are not well known. The dilemma in young children is that sensitive and specific laboratory methods for the detection of bacterial infections are not available or are used only in research.",

IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae were measured from acute and convalescent serum samples by two commercial EIA kits (Serion Immunodiagnostica, Wurzburg, Germany, from September 2000 to February 2001, and Ani Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland, from March 2001 to June 2002). The presence of IgM antibodies in both serum samples or in only the second sample was considered indicative of an acute infection [8]. IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to chlamydial species were studied using a microimmunofluorescence method. The presence of IgM antibodies and/or a fourfold or greater change in IgG levels between paired serum samples was considered to indicate acute Chlamydia pneumoniae infection [9]. Antibodies were also measured using the EIA method (Ani Labsystems), and the presence of IgM antibodies and/or a 1.5-fold or greater change in IgG or IgA levels between paired serum samples was considered a diagnostic finding.",

Findings were classified according to alveolar (dense fluffy opacity/consolidation) and/or interstitial (ill-defined diffuse opacity of interstitium) changes.

Although development of AOM is closely associated with viral respiratory infections, it is generally considered a bacterial infection, since bacteria can be cultured from middle ear fluid in up to 90% of the children [13]. Clinically, it was important to note that, on admission, when the median duration of illness was 3 days, only 65% of the cases of AOM were detected and the rest were found during the follow-up period. In a previous study of the temporal development of AOM, we showed that 54% of AOM cases develop during the first 4 days after the onset of respiratory infection and 75% during the first week of illness [14]. Our findings of viral dependence agree with previous studies. RSV infection is the major risk factor for AOM; in this study, 70% of the children with RSV infection developed AOM [2, 3]. A novel observation was that enterovirus infection can be associated with AOM in one-third of the cases [15].",

In young children, a great problem is that paranasal radiographs do not detect the opacity or mucosal thickness of the maxillary sinuses due to the similar density of the adjacent bone structures. For these two reasons, we only studied children \u22653 years of age, and we examined them 2 weeks after the acute illness. Even then, one-sixth of the children studied showed radiologic and clinical evidence of sinusitis.

Three children had serologic evidence of bacterial infection and alveolar infiltrates. Nearly all children studied had minor interstitial infiltrates, suggesting that acute wheezing may present a prototype of viral pneumonia in children. This is further supported by the finding that pneumonic crackles can be often heard on auscultation in children with wheezing [17, 18]. The chest radiograph may not be sensitive enough to show the whole profile of lung infiltrates as seen in adults with pneumonia [19]. In clinical practice, chest radiographs should not be routinely performed in wheezy children, since they do not improve treatment results and may lead to inappropriate antibiotic use.",

They can seldom be cultured from the blood, and invasive procedures such as tympanocentesis, maxillary sinus puncture, or lung tap are not beneficial and are not used in clinical practice. Measurement of antibody responses to these bacteria offers a noninvasive approach. Several studies have shown that 30\u201370% of children with pneumonia develop IgG antibodies against these bacteria, and measurements of specific antibody responses have been used in research [10, 20\u201323]. Very few patients with viral upper respiratory tract infection develop serologic responses to bacteria. For example, none of 26 children with parainfluenza virus-induced laryngitis [24] and 2 of 200 young adults with the common cold, usually caused by rhinovirus [25], showed a serologic response. This suggests that respiratory viral infections do not provide a nonspecific immune stimulation. Furthermore, only 2.7% of the 148 asymptomatic children had a significant increase in antibodies to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or M. catarrhalis in paired serum samples obtained 1 month apart [26].",

This finding is in agreement with radiologic findings of a low occurrence of alveolar infiltrates and a lack of lobar consolidations. In this study, AOM and sinusitis seldom induced bacterial antibody responses [27]. Rapola et al.

Using PCR, Freymuth et al. [29] detected M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae in 8% of 132 children with acute exacerbation of asthma. In contrast, Esposito et al.
