Daily sampling of the nasopharynx (NP) with flocked swab and tracheal aspirate (TA) was performed until successful weaning from mechanical ventilation or death. Admission samples were tested via multiplex RT-PCR for influenza A and B, parainfluenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus and adenoviruses. Of the influenza-positive patients, subsequent daily samples were tested for influenza. Results of viral diagnostics performed by routine care were collected, and compared with results found in this study.",

In eight out of 12 coronaviruspositive patients, only the TA sample was virus-positive, with negative NP. In subsequent daily samples of influenza-positive patients, viral loads were higher in TA compared with NP, up to 2 log viral copies. Duration of positivity of influenza in daily samples was up to two times longer in TA samples than in NP samples. Of all 35 virus-positive patients, 10 had received viral diagnostics via routine care.",
