Due to limited resources, screening for other viruses such as enteroviruses, rhinoviruses and the other HCoVs was not undertaken. This may be considered a limitation of the study as there is accumulating evidence that these viruses, in particular rhinoviruses, may play a more significant role in lower respiratory tract infections than previously recognised.\n10\n The role and clinical significance of the recently identified human bocavirus\n11\n and polyomaviruses\n12\n, \n13\n in respiratory disease is still under investigation. Ideally comprehensive screening of respiratory samples for most if not all respiratory viruses and relevant respiratory bacteria should be undertaken in order to obtain greater insight into the epidemiological significance of these pathogens in respiratory disease in the local setting.

This finding is lower than that reported in previous studies where detection of HCoV\u2010NL63 ranged from 1% to 7\u00b73%\n6\n, \n7\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n although higher prevalences of 8\u00b78% and 9\u00b73% have also been reported.\n21\n, \n22\n Most HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010positive children (75%) were under 6 months, indicating that this younger age group may be more susceptible to severe infections requiring hospitalisation; a finding supported by other studies where 38/76 (50%), 4/5 (80%) and 11/12 (92%) of HCoV\u2010NL63 infections occurred in this age group respectively.\n7\n, \n19\n, \n21\n Further, immunosuppression may also contribute to increased susceptibility to severe HCoV\u2010NL63 infection. In this study 4/5 HCoV\u2010NL63\u2010infected whose HIV status was known, were HIV infected. All four were <4 months of age and two required admission to ICU. It is not known whether maternal antibodies, if present, would provide protection or reduce the severity of infection. This protection is likely to be most effective in infants under 2 months. In this study very few infected infants were under this age, indicating a possible protective advantage. This observation is supported by the findings of other studies.\n7\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n In a very recent study by Dijkman et al., HCoV\u2010NL63 specific maternal antibodies were found in all newborns studied. These antibodies disappeared within 3 months providing further evidence of their possible protective role in early life.",

This is significantly different (P = 0\u00b70186) from the prevalence in the hospitalised group. This indicates that the virus is circulating in the community, probably causing mild symptoms which may trigger a wheezing episode requiring medical attention. In contrast the lower rate of HCoV\u2010NL63 infection identified in the hospitalised children suggests that the virus rarely causes severe lower respiratory tract infections. However, all HCoV\u2010infected children in the ambulatory group were over 12 months of age supporting the possibility that younger children are more susceptible to severe infections requiring hospitalisation.",
