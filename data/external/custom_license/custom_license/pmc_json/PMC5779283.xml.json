Under the leadership of the Lao PDR Ministry of Health (MOH), advances in the infectious disease surveillance system and improved laboratory diagnostic capacity for respiratory pathogens have been achieved. In December 2006, Lao PDR obtained the in\u2010country diagnostic capacity to analyze specimens for influenza viruses as part of a national AI outbreak response program and established an ILI surveillance system in the capital city of Vientiane. The objectives of the ILI surveillance program were to improve understanding of influenza disease burden and seasonality, to monitor circulating virus strains for new variants with pandemic potential, and to enable the early detection and response to influenza outbreaks. In July 2008, surveillance was expanded to include hospitalized pneumonia patients to better understand the epidemiology of severe influenza infections and identify groups at highest risk for serious complications. We describe findings from the first 2 years of influenza surveillance and discuss challenges and priorities for future influenza surveillance and disease burden research in a severely resource limited environment.",
