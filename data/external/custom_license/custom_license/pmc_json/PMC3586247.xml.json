Moreover, more than 50% of the neutralizing activity in the sera of convalescent SARS patients is mediated by RBD-S-specific antibodies [9,12], while RBD-S can absorb and remove the majority of neutralizing antibodies in the antisera of rabbits, mice and monkeys immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV or modified vaccinia virus expressing S protein [9,13]. These studies provide the rationale for selecting RBD-S as an important target for vaccine development. The recombinant 21 kDa RBD-S will be expressed in yeast (Pichia pastoris), bacteria (Escherichia coli), or baculovirus (pending studies demonstrating optimal protection, as described below). More recently, a second RBD-S 219-mer construct corresponding to residues 318\u2013536 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells and shown to exhibit correct folding and conformation followed by equivalent or enhanced protection [14]; this construct will also be evaluated as a back-up vaccination strategy.",

Among the concerns regarding these vaccines is the possibility of vaccine enhancement of disease, which has been noted with feline CoVs causing feline infectious peritonitis [1,19,20]. Similarly, laboratory animals administered alum-adjuvanted whole-virus SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with infectious virus experienced enhanced disease and immunopathology comprised of eosiniophilic infiltration and Th2-mediated inflammatory alveolar damage [21], similar to immunopathologic lung reactions found in infants and animals challenged with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [22,23]. A double-inactivated SARS-CoV (formalin and ultraviolet radiation) was also shown to elicit eosinophilic and immunoenhancing pathology, as well as poor protection, especially in aged animals, suggesting the possibility that aged humans (a desired target population for the vaccine) may be particularly vulnerable to vaccine-induced effects [24]. Further studies showed that a Venezuelan equine encephalitis vector containing the SARS nucleocapsid (NP) gene also elicited eosinophilic immunopathology in BALB/c mice after challenge without any noticeable protection [25]. Thus, it was hypothesized that the NP antigen of SARS-CoV may be responsible for this property of inactivated vaccines [25,26]. It was also reported that the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine was associated with lack of antibody affinity maturation followed by poor TLR stimulation, suggesting that NP may not account entirely for immune enhancement [27].",

However, it remains unclear whether such S protein constructs also elicit eosinophilic pathology. One report, for example, has indicated that S protein administered either as a baculovirus-expressed and purified recombinant protein or as a virus-like particle, causes Th2-type pathology with eosinophils, albeit reduced when compared with whole virus or NP protein constructs [28]. Similarly, a SARS vaccine candidate based on recombinant, properly folded, native full-length S protein trimers (expressed in mammalian cells) was also shown to elicit some immune enhancement [29].",

In addition, antigen/adjuvant formulation studies will be established both biochemically and by immunological assessment (potency). By performing a minimum of three full pilot runs with quality control for both process and release, the authors will maximize the probability of successful technology transfer for the cGMP manufacture and with optimal yield and purity. Accelerated and long-term stability studies will be conducted on the final formulations, with chemical stability emphasizing provocative tests at high pH to induce deamidation and with selective oxidizing agents to produce oxidation. In addition, stability will be assessed at different time points after conducting temperature incursion experiments (repeated freeze\u2013thaw cycles and storage at different temperatures). Following completion of process development of the vaccine, the production technology will be transferred to WRAIR for cGMP manufacture. The final product will be subjected to a rigorous battery of assays for lot and product release at Sabin-TCH, WRAIR and other contractors (Table 2).

Such activities are essential for a vaccine that might require emergency stockpiling. Biophysical assessment is initiated evaluating the recombinant protein using multiple biophysical techniques, including circular dichroism, intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence, light scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry [31,32]. Collectively, these studies provide specific information concerning the physical state of the protein as a function of temperature and pH. Biophysical data are then used to design high-throughput screening assays for the identification of potential stabilizers, typically GRAS (generally regarded as safe)-designated excipients and stabilizers that would be acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory agencies [32].\u2022 Preclinical testing in an innovative human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 transgenic (Tg) mouse model [33,34].

However, such vaccines also caused a Th2-derived immunoenhancing pathology bearing resemblance to the immunopathology that derailed efforts to produce an inactivated RSV vaccine more than four decades ago. Subsequent efforts determined that protective neutralizing antibodies were directed primarily against S protein responsible for receptor-binding, but even vaccines comprised of the full-length S protein can elicit immunopathology, albeit in reduced amounts. Therefore, efforts have, instead, focused on a subunit vaccine comprised of only the 193-mer RBD-S, the essential component responsible for receptor binding. In laboratory animals, recombinant RBD-S subunit vaccines elicited protection comparable with the S protein-based vaccines, but with minimal immune enhancement of immunopathology. A prototype recombinant RBD-S SARS vaccine formulated on alum, together with GLA at point of injection, is under development by the activities of a nonprofit PDP in collaboration with key academic, industrial and military partners.",

Following lot release and GLP toxicology testing, the vaccine will be ready for an IND submission and Phase I clinical testing. A full clinical development plan leading to product licensure will need outside consultation to confirm the quantity and quality, as well as affinity and avidity, of virus neutralizing antibodies required for protection.",
