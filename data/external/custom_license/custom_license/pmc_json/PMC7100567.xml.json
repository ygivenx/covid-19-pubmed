Hospital pharmacists, in particular, are ideally placed to report ADRs due to their access to patients\u2019 medical records and frequent interactions with prescribers. In the year 2009, the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) established a National Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC) with the aim of reporting and detecting ADRs [6]. The NPC expects all healthcare professionals, including doctors, pharmacists and nurses, to report ADR,s and have introduced both paper and online systems to facilitate ADR reporting. However, despite the availability of paper and online methods of ADR reporting, ADRs continue to be under-reported by healthcare professionals in Saudi Arabia [6].",

Although considerable improvement was reported in the knowledge of intervention participants, a majority of the participants (around 70%) failed to correctly identify the types of ADRs that should be reported in adults and children. A majority of the participants did not consider it important to report mild reactions from a drug with a black triangle in adults during both pre- and post-intervention assessments. As far as reporting of ADRs in children was considered, reporting of mild reactions from an existing drug was not considered to be important by most of the pharmacists who completed the study. One of the possible reasons that may explain such a misconception by intervention participants about ADR reporting is that perhaps they needed further reminders about ADRs and the types of ADRs that should be reported in both adults and children. It is important to highlight that participants in the intervention group only received the educational intervention once at the start of the study and did not receive any further education during the rest of the study period. With regards to the awareness of participants about the methods of ADR reporting, a majority (\u223c90%) were only aware about the online method of reporting prior to receiving educational intervention. Following the provision of ADR-specific education, more than half (61%) of the participants were reported to be aware of both paper-based and online methods of ADR reporting.

Topics related to pharmacovigilance are not given due share in the curricula offered by the majority of institutions offering medicine, pharmacy or nursing programmes in Saudi Arabia [7]. This could be explained by the lack of availability of enough qualified staff trained in pharmacovigilance and medication safety in Saudi Arabia [6]. The NPC, therefore, needs to make efforts to introduce the concept of pharmacovigilance to healthcare professionals working in the hospital settings by organizing specific educational seminars and workshops. Hospital pharmacists by virtue of their regular contact with patients together with access to medical records are ideally placed to report suspected ADRs and should therefore be encouraged to improve their ADR reporting. Provision of continuous professional development programmes to pharmacists can help address their knowledge gaps in ADR detection and further improve ADR reporting. The aim of such programmes should not only be to improve pharmacists\u2019 understanding about ADRs, but should also focus on changing their attitudes and perceptions toward ADR reporting. Furthermore, core topics related to pharmacovigilance should be included in the curricula offered by the academic institutions to enhance the knowledge of healthcare students about ADR reporting.",
