            "text": "The term \u2018Gene Therapy\u2019 was originally coined in 1972 to describe an approach to disease treatment that involved genetic modification of cells.1 Initial research in the field focused on introduction of genes into cells to achieve a therapeutic effect. However, the scope of gene therapy has since expanded to include use of any nucleic acid to alter gene function (reviewed in Collins et al.2 Naldini3). Since the way in which genes function underlies normal and pathological processes, employing technology that specifically modifies gene function has utility for treating a variety of diseases. Many conditions that are of serious public health importance in Africa are thus amenable to treatment using gene therapy. The technology is therefore of significance to the management of disease on the continent. Despite its potential importance, direct research on the topic in Africa has been limited. Although Africa has good research-intensive institutions, the continent loses most of its skilled personnel to laboratories in North America, Europe and Australasia.4 Consequently there is a scarcity of capable molecular biologists to carry out research on gene therapy. To strengthen human resource capacity, a priority is to create platforms that will attract qualified scientists and incentivize trained African scientists to remain on the continent. To date investigations have largely involved advancing therapeutic nucleic acids for management of hepatitis B virus (HBV)5, 6, 7, 8 and HIV-1 infections.9, 10",

Design of novel gene therapies is becoming more reliable and improved insights are leading to use of efficient standardization of drug development protocols. Although versatile, strategies employing gene therapy to treat disease require complex, labor intensive and time consuming multi-step processes. These are expensive and implementation requires sophisticated infrastructure to comply with regulatory requirements (Table 1). During preclinical development, specialized skills and equipment are required for gene therapeutics design and production. Large scale production of gene therapeutics before clinical testing requires facilities that meet the requirements for good manufacturing practice, which are lacking in Africa.11 These are important factors to be taken into account when considering feasibility of gene therapy in resource-poor settings of Africa.",

            "text": "Many different expressed or synthetic nucleic acids, as well as their chemically modified derivatives, are now considered to be gene therapeutics. Concommitant with the broader range of gene therapy-active molecules, the diseases that are now considered to be feasible therapeutic targets are highly varied. Treatment of viral infections, cancers, inherited diseases and immunotherapy are now all within the realm of gene therapy.2, 3 The technology is, however, not yet widely used in clinical settings, and licenses have usually only been granted in particular countries. Examples of gene therapies are Spinraza for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy,12 Gendicine, for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,13 Glybera, for the correction lipoprotein lipase deficiency,14 and Imlygic, for the treatment of melanoma lesions.15 Nevertheless, when gene therapy reaches the mainstream of disease treatment, it is likely to be important for management of diseases that affect the African continent particularly. Capacity development to enable Africans to tackle health problems of Africa is vital to the future of gene therapy on the continent. Key to success of any gene therapy program in Africa is government endorsement, ensuring sustainability, community engagement, enactment of appropriate regulatory legislation and rewarding of entrepreneurship. Although there are many research and diagnostic laboratories that carry out work on gene therapy-affiliated scientific topics, such as genetic analysis of African populations, there are very few research laboratories in Africa that specialize in work on developing gene therapy drugs. Africa has made significant progress with advancing stem cell therapy, and several laboratories focus on this therapeutic approach.16 To our knowledge, the Antiviral Gene Therapy Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council and University of the Witwatersrand (Wits/SAMRC AGTRU) in Johannesburg is the only lab in Africa that specialises in gene therapy research. The Institute for Cellular and Molecular Medicine (ICMM) at the University of Pretoria and the School of Life Sciences at the University of KwaZulu-Natal also pursue research themes on the topic of gene therapy. Issues related to the shortage of human resources (discussed above), funding for the maintenance of research laboratories and limited partnerships with international collaborators all contribute to the problem.",

For example, South Africa is the country with the highest Gini coefficient and unequal distribution of income translates to provision of health care that markedly favors the wealthy. Ensuring that there is fair allocation of resources within countries and over the continent will be challenging. Working towards this distributive justice, as well as by working within a framework of sound principles of health economics, will be important to safeguard benefits of high-technology medicine for African communities. Little if any research has been carried out to estimate the future benefits of implementing gene therapy in Africa and other parts of the world. This has been compounded by the fact that gene therapeutics are currently very expensive.17, 18 This point is clearly highlighted by the case of Glybera, which has a price tag of approximately U$ 1 M for a single administration. Similar issues regarding the pricing and efficacy of Imlygic have limited its widespread use.19 The roll-out of Strimvelis, a cell-based therapy for the treatment of adenosine deaminase-severe combined immunodeficiency, appears more encouraging and this has been related to robust data on efficacy of the therapeutic and reasonable pricing plans.19 Furthermore, the data suggest that the pricing of Strimvelis is significantly lower than of the alternative of enzyme replacement therapy. When the field matures, it is likely that bringing modern and powerful technology into the mainstream of medical practice will lower costs of gene therapy.",

Although non-communicable diseases are increasing in this region, infectious, nutritional, perinatal infant and maternal diseases remain major contributors to mortality. Deaths from measles and tetanus have declined significantly throughout the region. However HIV/AIDS, malaria, infectious hepatitis and tuberculosis are major contributors to mortality and morbidity on the continent.20, 21 Interventions to counter burdens of disease are best prioritized according to the most cost effective means of limiting morbidity and mortality from the commonest diseases.

In their recent publication, Frenk and Gomez-Dantes propose that the complexity of global health-care needs requires integrated and comprehensive strategies to be most effective. Until recently, health priorities were determined by what appeared to be opposing viewpoints. Examples of these so-called dichotomies include primary as opposed to specialized care, and prevention versus cure. Integration of these apparently polarized approaches is, however, important to create synergy to improve overall management of disease. Treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals is an easily understood example that illustrates the point. Although efforts to modify behavior have diminished spread of the virus, prognosis for untreated individuals who are already infected with the virus is grave. Suppressing HIV-1 replication through the use of combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically improves prognosis, renders individuals less infectious and therefore curtails transmission. However, cure from HIV-1 infection would be ideal to obviate the current requirement for long-term administration of antiretrovirals. The advances with gene therapy have demonstrated that cure from the serious infection is a possibility and is discussed below in more detail.",

Donor cells were thus resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection and the Berlin patient has been free from HIV-1 without the need for antiretrovirals. Although this is a particularly impressive achievement, widespread use of allogenic bone marrow transplant is problematic because of the difficulty with finding matched donors with the double ccr5-\u039432/ccr5-\u039432 mutations. To address this problem, gene editing is being employed in an attempt to disable ccr5 and render autologous cells resistant to HIV-1 infection.29, 30 Repeated cleavage of the target ccr5 sequence leads to repair by error-prone non-homologous end joining and eventual mutation of the target. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated (Cas) system, Zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases have all been employed to achieve target-specific cleavage and inhibition of HIV-1 replication (reviewed in Arbuthnot31). The favored strategy is to employ ex vivo modification of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (Figure 1). Modified hematopoietic stem cells may then be expanded before re-infusion into the patient. As a variation of the procedure, induced pluripotent stem cells may be used. The underlying principle is that stem cells retain the capability of self-renewal. The treated individual may therefore have a reconstituted immune system that comprises cells that are resistant to infection with the virus. In addition to mutating host factors such as CCR5,10 which are required for HIV-1 entry into host cells, strategies aimed at disabling viral sequences directly have also been used.32, 33 Although inactivation of the provirus has been observed, delivery of gene editors to all reservoirs of latently infected cells remains challenging.",

As with gene editing, artificial RNAi activators have been used to target host factors or viral sequences and impede viral replication.9 Since RNAi activators function at a post-transcriptional level of gene expression, long-term action of the gene silencers is necessary to achieve durable suppression of viral replication. Combinatorial approaches have been employed to counter the emergence of viral escape. Use of expression cassettes that generate mimics of the RNAi pathway may thus be preferable to administration of synthetic exogenous RNAi activators, which have a transient effect on viral replication. The effect of sustained expression of RNAi activators on cellular function is not yet comprehensively established, and unintended off-target effects may well occur. Strategies to overcome induction of an immune resonse by dsRNA, unintended binding of the exogenous RNAi effectors to cellular targets, cytotoxicity and saturation of the endogenous pathway remain important considerations.36, 37, 38",

Although effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV infection, they have no therapeutic benefit and are of no use to individuals who are already infected with the virus. Use of gene transfer to induce immunity against the virus has shown promise and is discussed below. Complications of chronic HBV infection remain a significant public health problem of particular relevance to Africa. Despite widespread vaccination programs, global mortality from HBV infection increased over the period from 1990 to 2013 and ~700 000 people died in 2013 as a result of complications of HBV infection.21 Available licensed therapies for HBV infection include reverse transcriptase inhibitors and derivatives of interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1). These drugs are capable of suppressing HBV replication, but rarely eliminate the virus from virus-infected individuals. The main reason for the shortcomings of current treatments is the stability of the viral replication intermediate comprising covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). This cccDNA, which serves as the template for expression of viral genes, is unaffected by nucleoside and nucleotide analogs and is rarely eliminated in IFN-\u03b1-treated carriers. Persistence of the virus therefore results in continued risk of mortality from complicating cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

As with advancing treatment of HIV-1 infection, both gene silencing and gene editing have potential (reviewed in Dever et al.,43 Ivacik et al.,44). HBV has an unusually compact genome with overlapping open reading frames. As a result, the cccDNA has restricted sequence plasticity, and unlike with HIV-1, viral escape is unusual. Targeting cccDNA with engineered sequence-specific nucleases, such as Zinc finger nucleases,45, 46, 47 transcription activator-like effector nucleases7, 48 and CRISPR/Cas,49, 50, 51, 52 provide a way of permanently disabling the replication intermediate. Several studies have shown that targeted mutagenesis disables HBV DNA and thereby provides a means for eliminating HBV from chronically infected individuals. Advancing the technology to a stage of evaluation in a clinical setting is currently a priority. This next step is faced with challenges of safe and efficient delivery of therapeutic sequences to HBV-infected hepatocytes following systemic administration (Figure 2), and verifying specificity of action of the gene editors. Sequences encoding potentially therapeutic CRISPR/Cas, dimeric Zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases are long and not easily accommodated by the popular adeno-associated viral vectors. Alternative approaches, such as formulating mRNA encoding the gene editors in synthetic non-viral vectors (NVVs), may be necessary.",

Hemorrhagic fever is very serious, and the condition is characterized by sudden onset of symptoms that rapidly progress to bleeding, shock and multi-organ failure with associated high mortality. The Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic that commenced in Guinea in December 2013, and which then spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone was particularly severe. The virus claimed the lives of in excess of 11 000 people in West Africa (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/case-counts.html). Marburg virus is another member of the Filovirus family of HFVs that is encountered most frequently in Africa. Given the often lethal nature of the infection with HFVs and their potential global impact, developing vaccines and effective antivirals is understandably a priority. Early clinical features of viral hemorrhagic fevers are usually not pathognomonic of the infection and early diagnosis is therefore difficult. Management is currently limited to being supportive and containment of infected individuals is vital to prevent spread. The rational design that forms the basis of gene therapies is particularly useful to disable HFVs and many investigations have shown that gene therapy has promise for the treatment of these serious infections.",

Exploiting RNAi to inactivate replication has therefore been a logical approach to advancing gene therapy to treat the infections. However, an important feature of infection with EBOV is that the viral VP35 protein inhibits the RNAi pathway.60 To overcome this effect, the VP35 sequence itself has been the target of strategies employing RNAi to inhibit EBOV replication.61 Given the acute nature of HFV infections, sustained RNAi-mediated silencing is less important than it is with HIV-1 or HBV infection. A very promising preclinical study showed that synthetic siRNAs, formulated in hepatotropic NVVs, protect macaques from lethal exposure to EBOV.61 Although several different types of human cells are permissive for infection with EBOV, replication of the virus occurs mainly in the liver, which is the rationale for using hepatotropic NVVs (Figure 2). Approaches that employ RNAi to disable replication of Marburg virus have also shown therapeutic potential. Synthetic siRNAs, formulated in hepatotropic NVVs, afforded good protection to guinea pigs62 and in Rhesus macaques63 following lethal challenge. Rift Valley Fever Virus, another potentially serious HFV, has also been shown to be susceptible to RNAi-based inhibition.64",

Since efficacy of nucleic acid-based treatments of EBOV and Marburg virus have been convincingly demonstrated in macaques, the case for initiating gene therapy to treat HFV infections is compelling. Although commendable, practical issues relating to rapid implementation on a large scale in affected African populations may currently be difficult. The recent outbreak of EBOV during 2014\u20132015 highlights how the \u2018Animal Rule\u2019 could have been employed. Efforts were underway to fast-track candidate vaccines and engagement between African and international stakeholders facilitated this process.66 However, since clinical data on efficacy are normally required for licensing, these interventions were never used during the EBOV outbreak,67 which endorses the merits of pursuing less traditional licensing routes, such as the \u2018Animal Rule\u2019.",

            "text": "For many years, vaccination has been the cornerstone of protecting against infectious diseases. The rationale is that administration of an immunogen, which may be a recombinant protein, or a killed or attenuated pathogen, induces memorized immunity to the pathogen without the risk of disease. Delivery of nucleic acids, such as those that may be engineered within recombinant viral vectors or synthetic formulations, have recently gained popularity as immunogens. Use of DNA encoding immunogens has been an active field of research,68 and early studies showed usefulness of the approach in preventing HBV infection.69, 70, 71 Recombinant viruses, such as engineered replication defective adenoviruses (Ads) and poxviruses (reviewed in Arbuthnot31), have now gained popularity. These vectors deliver immunogenic sequences efficiently and are capable of inducing powerful cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. Ads and poxviruses are now well understood and it is possible to manipulate their genomes to encode various immunogens and confer a variety of preferred biological properties. A drawback of recombinant viral vectors is that they are themselves immunogenic. The Step HIV vaccination trial highlighted a particularly serious consequence of the immunostimulatory effects of Ads.72 The vaccine, termed MRKAd5, comprised a serotype 5 Ad vector that encoded gag, pol and nef sequences of HIV-1 subtype B. The initial study entailed administration of the vaccine to non-African residents in parts of the world where clade B is the predominant HIV-1 subtype. Contrary to the intended effect, patients receiving the vaccine had a slightly higher risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection. The effect may have been a result of a predeliction of HIV-1 for T cells that had been activated by the vaccine. The subsequent HVTN503/Phambili trial analyzed administration of MRKad5 to South African subjects, where clade C is commonest.73 The study was however halted after outcome of the Step trial became available.72 Although early termination of the investigation limited ability to draw conclusions, the MRKAd5 vaccine did not appear to prevent HIV-1 infection in the South African subjects.73 Subsequent investigations attempted to augment anti-HIV-1 immunogenicity by employing a prime-boost strategy in individuals from South Africa74 and the USA.75, 76 Subjects initially received a 6-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding Gag, Pol and Nef from clade B, and Env from clades A, B and C. Recombinant Ad5-encoding clade B Gag-Pol fusion and Env from clades A, B and C was therafter given as a booster. Although the vaccination regimen induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, prevention of viral infection was not established. Another consideration relevant to developing Ad5-based vaccines is that pre-existing immunity to adenoviruses of this serotype occurs commonly. Ad26-based vaccines, which are distinct from Ad5 and bypass immunity to this serotype,77 are thus now being tested in clinical trials to develop vaccines against HIV-1.78, 79, 80",

This occurs following major histocompatability complex class II-mediated interaction of antigen-presenting cells with T helper cells and stimulation of B cell maturation to form antibody-producing plasma cells. Following intramuscular or intradermal administration of nucleic acid vectors, myocytes, dendritic cells and monocytes may take up and express the encoded immunogen.

Although they have a variable distribution throughout Africa, two of the more common inherited disorders on the continent are sickle cell disease and glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency. Sickle cell disease results from a homozygous transversion substitution in the first exon of the \u03b2-globin gene (reviewed in Hossain et al.82). The affected codon in the changed sequence encodes a valine amino acid instead of glutamic acid. A heterozygous state of the sickle gene provides protection against malaria and the mechanism is thought to involve preferential removal of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells by macrophages. When homozygous, the mutation results in serious pathology that manifests as sickle cell disease. Sickling of red blood cells results from polymerization of hemoglobin following deoxygenation. These red blood cells have a short life span, and cause endothelial and end organ damage with resultant high mortality and morbidity.",

Investigating use of gene therapy to counter the defect has thus become a popular line of research (reviewed in Marimani et al.8). Safe and efficient globin gene expression together with appropriately regulated transgene expression in progenitors of red blood cells are vital. Gene addition to target cells, expression of alternative globin genes, reactivation of fetal globin genes and gene editing have all been investigated as therpaeutic options. Two promising approaches entail gene editing to inactivate BCL11A expression83 or stimulation of homology directed repair to restore the normal sequence of the \u03b2-globin gene.43, 84 BCL11A is a repressor of \u03b3-globin gene expression in the adult. Monoallelic inactivation of the target of BCL11A within the \u03b3-globin gene increases its expression to achieve a therapeutic effect.82, 83 Application of autologous hematopoietic stem cell modification and re-infusion (Figure 1) is also a feasible mode of treatment.",

Efficacy of alternative preventative or therapeutic management is important. Recent development of directly acting antivirals that cure hepatitis C virus infection means that use of gene therapy to eliminate the virus is less likely (discussed above). Nevertheless, gene therapy has an important role when curative small molecule drugs are not available. Diseases caused by HIV-1 and HBV are examples where gene therapy may well be important to eliminate viral infections of African importance. In the case of HBV persistence, the problematic cccDNA is stable and unaffected by currently licensed drugs. Employing a gene editing approach provides the means to disable this viral transcription template. Gene editing may also be employed to render CD4+ T cells resistant to HIV-1 infection and inactivate the proviral DNA.",

            "text": "A major factor influencing the long-term prospects of gene therapy in Africa relates to the practicalities of using the technology in resource-poor settings. Gene therapy drugs are complex and costly to produce and administer. Their use in settings where financial resources are constrained is therefore moot. Most protocols are specialized and sophisticated facilities for preparation and administration of gene therapies are necessary. An example is the technology that is being developed for ex vivo modification of hematopoietic stem cells before autologous grafting (Figure 1). The strategy is elegant and results suggest that the approach may be coupled to gene editing to render cells resistant to HIV-1 infection. However very few centers in Africa are equipped to carry out such procedures. Ideally, the methodology will become cheaper and protocols will be simplified. Moreover, with progress of the technology, development of new candidate drugs should be rapid. This will be particularly useful to counter emerging pathogens and serious outbreaks such as have been caused by EBOV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In addition to technical challenges, lack of legal frameworks that regulate use of gene therapy may also hinder Africa deriving benefit from this technology. Implementating comprehensive legislation that will govern gene therapy research and translation into the clinic remains imperative. The diverse religious, ethical and moral beliefs in Africa also need to be accommodated. Despite these hurdles, implementing the legal framework for gene therapy may be informed by prior experiences of developing regulations pertaining to biotechnology and use of stem cell therapy in Africa.85",
