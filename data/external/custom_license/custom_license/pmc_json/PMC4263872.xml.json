The progression and severity of the symptoms observed in MERS\npatients resemble the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) observed in patients\ninfected with SARS-CoV, which caused a global pandemic in 2003, resulting in over\n8000 cases, with a case fatality rate of \u223c10% (3).

The replicase gene\ncontains two open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b. Translation of ORF1a yields\npolyprotein 1a (pp1a), and \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting facilitates\ntranslation of ORF1b to yield pp1ab (7). The\npp1a and pp1ab precursors are co- and post-translationally processed into functional\nnsps by multiple ORF1a-encoded protease domains. CoVs employ either one or two\npapain-like proteases (PLpros), depending on the virus species, to\nrelease nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 and a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro)\nthat cleaves all junctions downstream of nsp4 (reviewed in Ref. 8). Comparative sequence analysis of the MERS-CoV genome\nand proteome allowed for the prediction and annotation of 16 nsps, along with the\nlocation of the probable proteolytic cleavage sites (6). The MERS-CoV PLpro domain, which resides in nsp3, has\nrecently been confirmed to recognize and cleave after the sequence\nLXGG at the nsp1\u21932 and nsp2\u21933 junctions, as\ndefined previously for other CoV PLpros, as well as an\nIXGG sequence, which constitutes the nsp3\u21934 cleavage\nsite (9, 10).",

Additional Ub molecules can be linked to any of the\n7 lysine residues in Ub itself or to its N terminus to generate polyubiquitin\n(poly-Ub) chains of various linkage types (11). The best-studied linkages are the ones occurring at Lys48 of\nUb, which results in the targeting of the tagged substrate to the 26 S proteasome\nfor degradation, and at Lys63, which generates a scaffold for the\nrecruitment of cellular proteins to activate numerous signaling cascades, including\ncritical antiviral and proinflammatory pathways (11). The C terminus of Ub can be recognized by deubiquitinating enzymes\n(DUBs), which catalyze the deconjugation of Ub, thus reversing the effects of\nubiquitination (12). Interestingly, CoV\nPLpros, including those of MERS- and SARS-CoV, have been suggested to\nact as multifunctional proteases that not only cleave the viral polyproteins at\ninternal LXGG cleavage sites but also remove Ub and the antiviral\nUb-like molecule interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins,\npresumably to suppress host antiviral pathways (9, 13\u201319).",

Due to the dependence of MERS-CoV replication on the\nability of PLpro to cleave the nsp1\u2013nsp3 region of the replicase\npolyproteins, studying the role of PLpro DUB activity, specifically in\nthe suppression of the cellular innate immune response, is difficult because both\nactivities depend on the same enzyme active site. Selective inactivation of only the\nDUB activity of PLpro would enable the study of how this activity alone\naffects cellular signaling; however, achieving this requires detailed information on\nthe structural basis of Ub recognition and deconjugation by PLpro. To\nthis end, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PLpro bound to\nUb to elucidate the molecular determinants of Ub recognition. Based on the structure\nof this complex, mutations were introduced that selectively disrupted Ub recognition\nby targeting regions of the Ub-binding site on PLpro that were\nsufficiently distant from the active site of the protease. Using this approach, we\nwere able to remove the DUB activity from PLpro without affecting its\nability to cleave the nsp3\u21934 cleavage site in trans. This\nenabled us, for the first time, to demonstrate that the DUB activity of MERS-CoV\nPLpro can suppress the MAVS-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2\nexpression.",

Electron density maps calculated using diffraction data\ncollected from PLpro\u00b7Ub complex that crystallized in\nspace group P63 revealed weak density for the covalently\nbound Ub molecule. Although the entire bound Ub molecule could be\nmodeled within its binding site on PLpro in this crystal\nform, high temperature factors for atoms comprising the modeled Ub\nmolecule suggested that it was not rigidly bound to the protease despite\nbeing covalently linked to the active site cysteine. Further analysis of\nthe crystal packing revealed that the Ub molecule was fully exposed to\nsolvent and not involved in crystal contacts, which provided a degree of\nmobility to Ub when bound to PLpro (Fig. 3A). This result encouraged us\nto pursue additional crystallization conditions, which yielded crystals\nof PLpro\u00b7Ub in space group P6522 (Figs. 2B and 3B). The crystal\npacking in this space group allowed for multiple crystal contacts\nbetween the bound Ub monomer and surrounding symmetry mates and resulted\nin clear, well defined density for the Ub molecule (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, relative\nto the P63 crystal forms of PLpro, the fingers\ndomain in this crystal form was moved toward Ub (Fig. 2C). In light of these\nmovements, the PLpro\u00b7Ub structure with the fingers\ndomain positioned away from Ub (space group P63) will\nhereafter be referred to as \u201copen\u201d\nPLpro\u00b7Ub, whereas the structure with the fingers\ndomain shifted toward Ub (space group P6522) will be referred\nto as \u201cclosed\u201d PLpro\u00b7Ub. An overlay\nof the different PLpro crystal structures that have been\ndetermined reveals that these structures vary in the position of the\nzinc ribbon motif, further suggesting a high degree of mobility for this\nregion (Fig. 2C).\nIn line with this observation, movement of the fingers domain toward\nbound Ub was also reported for the SARS-CoV PLpro domain,\nwhich displayed a 3.8-\u212b movement of the zinc atom when comparing\nthe Ub-bound and unbound structures (58). Further comparison of the closed MERS-CoV\nPLpro\u00b7Ub structure with the recently determined\nSARS-CoV PLpro\u00b7Ub structure (58) revealed differences in the relative\norientation of the fingers domain of the two proteases. The MERS-CoV\nPLpro fingers domain was found to be shifted\n\u223c26\u00b0 away from the palm domain compared with that of\nSARS-CoV PLpro, resulting in a slight difference in the Ub\nbinding orientation, with the MERS-CoV PLpro-bound Ub being\npositioned closer toward helix \u03b17 of the palm domain (Fig. 4).",

The PLpro active\nsite is composed of a Cys1592-His1759-Asp1774\ncatalytic triad, which adopts a catalytically competent arrangement in both the\nunliganded and Ub-bound structures of PLpro (Fig. 5C). The oxyanion hole of the\nPLpro active site appears to be composed of backbone amides from\nresidues Asn1590, Asn1591, and Cys1592, which\nappear suitably arranged to stabilize the negative charge that develops on the\ncarbonyl oxygen of the scissile bond during catalysis (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, as noted by Lei\net al. (49), the\nMERS-CoV PLpro active site appears incomplete. In SARS-CoV\nPLpro, Trp107 (amino acid numbering according to the\nstructure of Protein Data Bank entry 2FE8) is positioned within the enzyme's active\nsite with the indole nitrogen of its side chain oriented such that it is\nprobably involved in forming part of the oxyanion hole (51). In the case of MERS-CoV PLpro, we and\nothers (48, 49) have found the structurally equivalent residue in\nMERS-CoV PLpro to be Leu1587, which would be unable to\nparticipate in stabilizing the oxyanion during catalysis. Furthermore, it was\nrecently shown that MERS-CoV PLpro L1587W mutants show greater\ncatalytic efficiency than wild-type PLpro (48, 49). Given\nthe effect this residue has on the catalytic rate of PLpro, it will\nbe very interesting to understand how this residue influences MERS-CoV\nreplication kinetics. It has been proposed that the decreased catalytic\nefficiency may influence maturation of the MERS-CoV polyprotein (48) and could be involved in the recognition of\nresidues downstream of the scissile bond of the polyprotein cleavage sites or in\nthe modulation of PLpro DUB activity.",

This loop is\ndisordered in our unliganded PLpro structure and that previously\ndetermined by others (49); however, in\nboth of our PLpro\u00b7Ub structures, we found this loop to be\nfully resolved, supported by the main-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions\nbetween Arg74 of Ub and Gly1758 of PLpro, as\nwell as a hydrophobic interaction between Val1757 and\nPro1644, two PLpro residues present on opposite sides\nof the active site cleft (Fig.\n5A). The side-chain \u03b7-amino group of the Ub\nresidue Arg74 is also hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl\ngroup of PLpro residue Thr1755; however, this interaction\nis only seen in the open PLpro\u00b7Ub structure. The SARS-CoV\nPLpro domain has also been crystallized both in the presence\n(51) and absence (58) of Ub, and although the BL2 loop of unbound\nSARS-CoV PLpro was resolved in two of three monomers of the\nasymmetric unit, the third showed weak electron density for BL2 and high\ntemperature factors, indicating a high degree of mobility. In addition, in the\ntransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus USP domain PL1pro, a\nstructurally analogous BL2 loop was found to be in an open conformation with\npoorly defined electron density in the absence of substrate (55). It is interesting to note that all three\ncoronavirus USP DUBs crystallized to date (from MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and\ntransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus) demonstrate a significant degree of\nflexibility within the BL2 loop region in the absence of substrate and that none\nof the structures determined in their unbound form demonstrate obstruction of\nthe active site via BL2.",

This allowed us to establish that the DUB activity of PLP2 is\ndirectly responsible for suppressing Ub-dependent antiviral pathways during\ninfection of primary host cells (61).\nSubsequently, Ratia et al. (62) applied a similar strategy to the SARS-CoV PLpro\ndomain in order to partially remove the DUB activity of PLpro while\nmaintaining the nsp2-3-processing function. We now used the crystal structure of\nthe USP-like MERS PLpro\u00b7Ub complex to guide the design of\nmutations targeting the Ub-binding site on PLpro that would\ncompletely disrupt Ub binding without affecting the structural integrity of the\nactive site. PLpro residues interacting directly with Ub were\nreplaced with larger, bulkier residues that would prevent Ub binding by altering\nboth shape and surface electrostatics of the Ub-binding site. Individual\nmutation of eight different PLpro residues (Arg1649,\nThr1653, Ala1656, Asn1673,\nVal1674, Val1691, Val1706, and\nGln1708) and combinations thereof were generated (Fig. 6, A\u2013D).\nImportantly, these residues are located at a distance from the PLpro\nactive site, and thus we hypothesized that they would only participate in DUB\nactivity and not polyprotein processing.",

Residue Ile44 of Ub, which forms part of\nthe hydrophobic patch that is commonly recognized by Ub-binding proteins (63), interacts with the hydrophobic side\nchain of Val1691 of PLpro (Fig. 6B). Residues Gln49 and\nGlu51 of Ub form hydrogen-bonding interactions with\nThr1653 that is present on helix \u03b17, which runs through\nthe center of PLpro. Two arginine residues, Arg1649 of\nPLpro and Arg72 of Ub (the latter of which forms part\nof the C-terminal tail of Ub that is bound in the PLpro active site\ncleft) are oriented such that the guanidinium groups of these residues are\narranged in a stacked conformation (Fig.\n6C). In addition, due to the inward movement toward\nUb of the closed PLpro\u00b7Ub fingers domain, a unique\nhydrogen-bonding interaction between Gln62 of Ub and\nGln1708 of PLpro and a hydrophobic interaction between\nPhe4 of Ub and Val1706 of PLpro were found\nto occur in this complex (Fig.\n6D). Residue Ala1656 is positioned near\nthe C terminus of PLpro helix \u03b17, and although it is not\ndirectly involved in Ub binding, we believed that it was positioned such that\nthe introduction of larger residues (e.g. arginine or\nphenylalanine) could disrupt Ub recognition, and thus this residue was targeted\nfor mutation (Fig. 6C).\nTwo residues on the solvent-facing region of the PLpro zinc ribbon\nmotif, Asn1673 and Val1674, were also targeted for\nmutagenesis. Although they do not bind Ub at the S1 binding site (the substrate\nbinding site on PLpro responsible for binding mono(Ub) in our\nstructure; see Ref. 64 for nomenclature),\nwe hypothesized that it may inhibit association with the distal Ub on\nLys63 poly-Ub chains based on a superposition of a\nLys63-linked di-Ub model onto the PLpro-bound Ub\nmolecule of the closed PLpro\u00b7Ub complex structure determined\nhere (not shown). In addition, the crystal structure of USP21 bound to linear\ndi-Ub was recently determined and revealed that the tip of the fingers domain of\nthis DUB acts as an S2 recognition site, binding to the distal Ub of a linear\ndi-Ub molecule (57). Given the structural\nsimilarity between Lys63 di-Ub and linear di-Ub and the clear\nactivity we observed for MERS-CoV PLpro toward Lys63, we\nhypothesized that mutating residues Asn1673 and Val1674\nnear the zinc ribbon may also disrupt Ub processing.",

V5-tagged PLpro (wild type\nand mutants) was co-expressed with N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally\nV5-tagged MERS-CoV nsp3C-4 excluding the PLpro domain, hereafter\nreferred to as HA-nsp3C-4-V5. We assume that the successful processing of the\nnsp3\u21934 site in HA-nsp3C-4-V5 is indicative of unaltered proteolytic\ncleavage capability of PLpro, which during infection facilitates the\nrelease of nsp1, -2, and -3 from the viral polyproteins. Processing of\nHA-nsp3C-4-V5 in trans by wild-type PLpro and our\npanel of mutants was visualized via Western blotting (Fig. 7A). Whereas wild-type\nPLpro was able to cleave HA-nsp3C-4-V5 substrate in\ntrans, the PLpro active site mutant C1592A was\nunable to cleave the nsp3\u21934 site (Fig.\n7A, compare lanes 5 and\n6 and lanes 19 and 20).\nAs expected, each of the substitutions in the Ub-binding site of\nPLpro only minimally affected nsp3\u21934 cleavage, with the\nexception of the A1656R mutant that displayed a clearly reduced ability to\ncleave HA-nsp3C-4-V5 compared with wild-type PLpro (Fig. 7A, compare\nlanes 5 and 10). This suggests that\nAla1656 of PLpro may be involved in recognizing and\nbinding sequences in the vicinity of the nsp3\u21934 cleavage site. Most\ndouble and triple substitutions tested were also slightly less efficient in\ncleaving HA-nsp3C-4-V5 compared with the wild-type control.",

Expression of\nwild-type PLpro resulted in a strong decrease of the accumulation of\nFLAG-Ub conjugates, whereas a negligible effect was observed upon expression of\nactive site mutant C1592A (Fig.\n7B, compare lanes 3 and\n4 and lanes 16 and 17).\nSubstitutions of residue Val1691, positioned on strand \u03b212 of\nPLpro, and Thr1653 and Ala1656, residues\nlocated on helix \u03b17 (Fig. 6,\nB and C), displayed the clearest reduction\nof PLpro DUB activity (Fig.\n7B, lanes 5\u20138). The V1691R\nmutation had the most pronounced effect, and a PLpro T1653R/V1691R\ndouble mutant also displayed severely reduced DUB activity, comparable with that\nseen for the active site mutant (Fig.\n7B, compare lanes 4 and\n5 and lanes 17 and 22).\nNotably, a more conservative substitution at the same position, V1691L, had a\nmuch less pronounced effect on DUB activity (Fig.\n7B, lane 6). Substitution of\nVal1674 with either Ser or Arg impaired DUB activity but to a\nmuch lesser extent than substitutions targeting Val1691,\nThr1653, and Ala1656 (Fig. 7B, compare lanes\n5\u20138, 10, and 11). The N1673R\nsubstitution did not negatively affect DUB activity of PLpro at all,\nwhereas the N1673R/V1674S double substitution resulted in slightly greater DUB\nactivity (Fig. 7B,\nlanes 9 and 20). These results do not\nsupport our hypothesis based on modeling that Asn1673 and\nVal1674 might form part of an S2 binding site that recognizes an\nadditional distal Ub within a Lys63-linked chain. Further structural\nstudies are needed to validate the role of these residues in binding Ub chains.\nIt should be noted, however, that these mutants may still be able to process\nLys63-linked poly-Ub chains by recognizing a single Ub monomer at\nthe end of a poly-Ub substrate, which may explain the ineffectiveness of these\nmutations in disrupting DUB activity. Mutations at residues Val1706\nand Gln1708 did not influence DUB activity of PLpro (Fig. 7B, lanes\n18 and 19). Given that these residues were only\nfound to interact with Ub in our closed PLpro structure (Fig. 6A), their failure to\ninhibit DUB activity in this cellular DUB assay is not surprising and indicates\nthat these residues are not essential for Ub recognition. Interestingly and\nrepeatedly observed, the R1649Y mutant was found to have even greater DUB\nactivity than wild-type PLpro (Fig.\n7B, compare lanes 3 and\n12). This residue was found to interact with residue\nArg72 of Ub, and although this result was unexpected, it is\npossible that the R1649Y mutant retains the ability to interact with\nArg72 of Ub via a cation-\u03c0 interaction between the\naromatic tyrosine inserted into PLpro and the positively charged\narginine of Ub. Together, the findings from our mutagenesis study demonstrate\nthat it is possible to selectively decouple the DUB and polyprotein processing\nactivities of MERS-CoV PLpro through structure-guided site-directed\nmutagenesis.",

Because RIG-I and IRF3\nnormally need to be activated through post-translational modification\n(ubiquitination and phosphorylation, respectively), constitutively active\nvariants were used (RIG-I(2CARD) and IRF3(5D)), which\nefficiently induce downstream signaling independent of these activation steps.\nCells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding one of these innate immune\nsignaling proteins and wild-type PLpro, the PLpro active\nsite mutant C1592A, or full-length MERS-CoV nsp3 containing the PLpro\ndomain. The inhibitory effect of the PLpro variants on the activation\nof the IFN-\u03b2 promotor by the different stimuli was measured via\nco-expression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene under control of the\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter. Another co-transfected plasmid encoding\nRenilla luciferase was included as an internal control in\norder to be able to correct for variability in transfection efficiency. At 16 h\npost-transfection, luciferase activities were measured, and activation of the\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter induced by expression of RIG-I(2CARD), MAVS,\nor IRF3(5D) was set at 100% (Fig.\n8). In accordance with Mielech et al. (16), we observed that MERS-CoV\nPLpro significantly reduced the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation\nthat could be induced by expression of either RIG-I(2CARD) or MAVS.\nThis effect was concentration-dependent, whereas the PLpro active\nsite mutant was unable to block IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation (Fig. 8, A and\nC). MERS-CoV nsp3 expression also inhibited RIG-I- and\nMAVS-mediated IFN-\u03b2 promoter induction (Fig. 8, B and D), and together\nthis suggested that PLpro inhibits innate immune signaling at least\ndownstream of the MAVS adaptor and possibly also in the signaling between RIG-I\nand MAVS. MERS-CoV PLpro also inhibited activation of the\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter after stimulation with IRF3(5D) in a\nconcentration-dependent manner, whereas the C1592A mutant did not reduce\nIFN-\u03b2 promoter activation (Fig.\n8E). However, expression of full-length MERS-CoV\nnsp3 did not significantly inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation after\nstimulation with IRF3(5D) (Fig.\n8F). This suggests that the subcellular localization\nof the protease, which in the case of full-length nsp3 is membrane-anchored and\nin the case of the PLpro domain is presumably cytosolic, may be\nimportant in determining its substrate specificity. Taken together, our results\nsuggest that MERS-CoV PLpro primarily interferes with the\nIFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway at the level between MAVS and IRF3.",

Strikingly, each mutant containing the V1691R substitution\nwas completely unable to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation, resulting in\nrelative luciferase activity levels similar to those seen with the active site\nmutant (Fig. 9, lanes 4,\n16, and 17). This strongly suggested that\nthe DUB activity of PLpro, which we found to be severely impaired in\nV1691R mutants (Fig. 7B),\nis responsible for suppressing MAVS-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in\nthis assay. The level of reduction in DUB activity corresponded to the degree of\ninhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation for all PLpro mutants\ntested, which strengthens this conclusion. In accordance with its increased DUB\nactivity, mutant R1649Y suppressed MAVS-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity\nmore effectively than wild-type PLpro.",

The fact that suppression of IFN-\u03b2\npromoter activation was completely eliminated for several of our mutants (Fig. 9) strongly suggests that the proteolytic\nactivity still present in those mutant enzymes has no additional role in the\nsuppression of this particular branch of the innate immune response\n(e.g. by directly cleaving RIG-I or MAVS). A number of other\nCoV papain-like proteases with DUB activity have also been implicated in\nantagonizing the host innate immune response (15, 23, 66, 67). In\nagreement with our data, recent studies have demonstrated the ability of MERS-CoV\nPLpro to inhibit RIG-I-, MDA5-, and MAVS-dependent IFN-\u03b2\npromoter activation as well as to down-regulate the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA\ntranscripts in MDA5-stimulated cells (16).\nThe current data support the hypothesis that all of these activities solely depend\non the deubiquitinating capacities of these coronavirus enzymes. Reports regarding\nthe dependence of MERS-CoV PLpro-mediated IFN-\u03b2 antagonism on the\nenzyme's protease activity have, however, varied thus far. Mielech et\nal. (16) recently demonstrated\nthat a MERS-CoV nsp3 fragment containing PLpro but excluding the\ntransmembrane domain can inhibit MAVS-, RIG-I-, and MDA5-dependent IFN-\u03b2\npromoter activation, and MDA5 mediated IFN-\u03b2 mRNA transcription only with a\nfunctional PLpro active site. Yang et al. (9) on the other hand used a MERS-CoV\nPLpro expression product extending into the nsp3 transmembrane region\nto demonstrate that down-regulation of RIG-I-stimulated IFN-\u03b2 promoter\nactivity is seen even with an active site knock-out mutant. Here we show that\ninhibition of RIG-I-, MAVS-, and IRF3-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity by the\nMERS-CoV PLpro domain is clearly dependent on a functional active site\nand that it is specifically the DUB activity of the protease that mediates this\ninhibition. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that other parts of nsp3\ncontain additional innate immune suppressing activities, which may be responsible\nfor the protease-independent effects reported with longer expression products.",

The main-chain\namide of Gly75 of Ub forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl\ngroup of PLpro Asp1645, and a hydrogen bonding\ninteraction occurs between the main-chain carbonyl of Arg74\nof Ub and the main-chain amide of Gly1758 of\nPLpro. The side-chain \u03b7-amino group of Ub residue\nArg74 is hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl group\nof PLpro Thr1755. Hydrogen bonds also occur\nbetween the side-chain \u03f5- and \u03b7-amino groups of Ub\nArg72 and the carboxylate of PLpro\nAsp1645 as well as between the main-chain amide of Ub\nresidue Leu73 and side chain PLpro residue\nAsp1646. The BL2 loop between strands \u03b215 and\n\u03b216 is indicated with an arrow. B, alternate\norientation of the PLpro active site showing a hydrogen\nbonding interaction between the Ub Leu73 main-chain amide\ngroup and the side-chain carboxylate of PLpro residue\nAsp1646. The side chain of Ub residue Leu63\nalso undergoes hydrophobic interactions with PLpro residues\nPhe1750 and Pro1731. C, the\nMERS-CoV PLpro\nCys1592-His1759-Asp1774 catalytic\ntriad residues are shown as well as residues Asn1590 and\nAsn1591, which together with Cys1592 form the\noxyanion hole via their backbone amide groups. The covalent 3CN molecule\nis shown linking the C terminus of Ub to the active site\nCys1592 of PLpro. The active site\nLeu1587 residue, which is not involved in oxyanion hole\nformation, is also shown. The electron density is a maximum likelihood\nweighted 2Fo \u2212\nFc map contoured at 1.0\u03c3.
