Appropriate management of patients with viral respiratory illnesses requires rapid and accurate identification of the etiologic agent of these infections. Unfortunately, identifying a specific viral respiratory pathogen in these infections can be problematic and elusive for several reasons, such as the wide range of potential viral pathogens that can cause similar clinical manifestations, the insensitivity of conventional laboratory diagnostic tests, and the presence of new and mutating viral pathogens. Rapid detection and identification of viral pathogens causing respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated to significantly decrease the duration of hospitalization and reduce management costs, and to avoid additional laboratory testing and unnecessary antibiotic use; additionally, rapid detection and identification help to guide specific antiviral therapy and appropriate isolation precautions [1, 2].\n\n",

However, as a result of the application of novel detecting techniques, other viruses have been added to the list of significant viral respiratory pathogens: coronaviruses (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinoviruses (hRhV), human bocaviruses (hBoV), PIV4, the newly discovered parvovirus types 4 and 5, mimivirus, respiratory polyomaviruses, and xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). Some of these emerging pathogens (identified since 2000) can cause pandemic or fatal respiratory infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H7N7, and H7N3), and swine influenza viruses (H1N1); furthermore, the clinical significance of others is still not known. Indeed, all of the viruses mentioned are associated with similar and atypical clinical presentations and infect both upper and lower respiratory tracts, which makes it very difficult for clinicians to distinguish the causative pathogen without a laboratory diagnosis.",

However, viral culture is technically demanding, relatively insensitive compared with serological tests and PCR, and time consuming even incorporated with shell vial culture techniques.

Several formats, led by immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), direct fluorescent antibody assay (DFA), and enzyme immunoassay (EIA), are available for detecting and even subtyping main respiratory viruses (eg, Flu and RSV) within a short time [3]. It should be kept in mind that false-negative rapid antigen results can be expected, and should not be interpreted as excluding the possibility of infection caused by the tested viral pathogen. With low sensitivities, rapid antigen tests were usually relegated to point-of-care testing for influenza in defined settings. Serology-based procedures have been primarily in surveillance and epidemiology studies, whereas their applications in diagnosis of viral respiratory diseases have been limited. A single serum sample to detect viral-specific IgG is not useful for diagnosis. Instead, paired acute- and convalescent-phase sera, collected at least 10 days apart, are needed to detect a fourfold or greater increase in serum antibody levels indicative of a recent infection.",

Nucleic acid amplification tests led by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed for most respiratory viruses by the end of the decade; today, they are emerging to be used in the routine clinical laboratory as the preferred method for viral diagnostic testing, either as an adjunct to or a replacement for another method. Real-time technology and the ability to perform multiplex testing have facilitated this emergence. Molecular techniques have found their niches in laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections by providing rapid and highly sensitive tools to detect and identify the causal pathogens. They also allow assessment of the impact of a wider array of potential pathogens on viral respiratory infections than previously possible, and target-specific (multiplex) approaches have proved feasible for enhanced broad-spectrum respiratory virus diagnosis. A wide range of both target and signal amplification nucleic acid amplification methods could be applied to respiratory virus detection. The target amplification technique has the advantage of sensitivity above signal amplification, but the latter may be simpler and less laborious for high throughput. In this review, we focus on commercially available molecular assays, and discuss the performance characteristics required to successfully implement molecular methods for routine diagnosis of viral respiratory infections.",

Pandemics follow the emergence of a novel virus subtype with a new combination of the hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) gene. Rapid antigen assays for the detection of influenza are commonly available, although negative results using these assays increase significantly with the increasing age of the patient. Real-time PCR or culture is necessary to avoid false-negative results in older patients. Molecular methods for detecting influenza viruses were described as early as 1991. Various targets have been used, including the matrix, HA, and NA genes. The first commercially available assay was the Hexaplex assay (Prodesse Inc., Waukesha, WI); it had an analytical sensitivity of 10 copies for influenza A and five copies for influenza B [6], and set the standard for the detection of influenza viruses. Since then, it has been developed and is now a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved multiplex RT-PCR assay (Pro-Flu+; Prodesse Inc.) for detecting influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. According to the manufacturer, it has a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93% for influenza A and 98% and 99% for influenza B, respectively [7, 8]. Another FDA-approved multiplex panel is the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada), which is capable of detecting 12 respiratory viruses and subtypes including influenza. This assay uses multiplex PCR and the Luminex x-MAP suspension array to have a reported clinical sensitivity of 100% for influenza A [9\u2022, 10, 11].",

Rapid antigen assay in EIA format has been used for many years for RSV detection. Because of its good specificity and poor sensitivity, specimens with negative antigen results are routinely re-tested by culture. As with influenza, the Hexaplex assay was the first commercially available assay for RSV detection, with a clinical sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 99% in a mixed population of adults and children [22]. It has been redesigned into a multiplex RT-PCR format (Pro-Flu+) and received FDA clearance [7, 8]. Another FDA-approved molecular device, the xTAG RVP (Luminex), covers RSV as well. Both FDA-cleared devices have a much higher clinical sensitivity and specificity for RSV detection compared with conventional rapid antigen immunoassays, especially in immunocompromised adults [23]. Other RUO and ASR assays commercially available for RSV detection and RSV-A and B subgrouping include the MultiCode-PLx RVP from EraGen and the ResPlex II from Qiagen. It has been demonstrated that these multiplex RT-PCR\u2013based molecular devices are the most sensitive method for the detection of RSV, regardless of the population tested. Moreover, specimens with low viral load in adults and immunocompromised patients are more likely to be antigen negative and RT-PCR positive [8].",

Severe hMPV infections resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions have been described in elderly adults with underlying conditions and in immunocompromised patients. hMPV infections can be diagnosed using a variety of approaches including serology, virus isolation, and antigen or nucleic acid detection. Available commercial molecular assays include the xTAG RVP assay (Luminex), the ResPlex II (Qiagen), the MultiCode-PLx RVP (EraGen), the Pro hMPV+ Real Time Assay RUO (Prodesse Inc.), and the Seeplex RV detection kit (Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea). The xTAG RVP assay is the only FDA-approved commercial multiplex assay for hMPV and has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 98.6% [24\u2022\u2022]. The Pro-hMPV+ assay had a clinical sensitivity of 95%, according to the manufacturer. The sensitivity and specificity of the ResPlex II and MultiCode-PLx assays for detecting hMPV have not been determined. It has been reported that the MultiCode-PLx RUO assay is much more sensitive than the ResPlex II Panel RUO assay [13\u2022, 14]; however, these reports suffered from low numbers of positive samples and lack of a comparator assay.",

Although rhinoviruses can be detected by viral culture, most clinical laboratories did not provide rhinovirus diagnosis until recently; several in-house developed molecular assays showed sensitivities for rhinovirus detection of 85% using NASBA and 83% using RT-PCR [25].

The molecular assays will be used mainly to supplement rapid antigen testing and culture. For viral pathogens (eg, parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, and enteroviruses), molecular assays have gradually been implemented as the mainstay. Molecular methods ensure appropriate early management and use of infection prevention and control procedures for vulnerable individuals, as well as differentiation between designated serotypes for epidemiological study [33, 34, 35\u2022]. For the newly discovered respiratory viral pathogens (eg, hMPV, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses), molecular assays have become the exclusive tool in the diagnostic algorithm [36\u201338]. Molecular techniques also have resulted in discovery of novel respiratory viruses, such as human bocaviruses [27\u201329, 39, 40], respiratory polyomaviruses [41, 42], and XMRV [43, 44], although their clinical relevance needs further investigation.",

It has been reported that these coinfections are medically relevant and that effective treatment for severe respiratory tract infections will increasingly require diagnosis of all involved pathogens, as opposed to single-pathogen reporting [9\u2022, 13\u2022, 35\u2022, 45, 46\u2022\u2022]. However, one study from The Netherlands indicated that implementation of multiple molecular assays for the etiologic diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections increased the diagnostic yield considerably, yet did not reduce antibiotic use or costs [30]. Well-designed outcome studies are needed to further demonstrate the clinical relevance and cost effectiveness of simultaneous multipathogen detection and identification strategies for respiratory viral coinfections. Interpretive reports may be needed to assist the clinician in assessing such mixed infections.",

Although qualitative molecular tests should only be used for diagnosis, viral load change in respiratory specimens can be used as an indication of \u201ctest of cure\u201d for therapy monitoring. With implementation of the real-time technology, rapid and accurate viral load quantification by molecular assays is possible, which has proved useful in some clinical settings [49, 50]. Real-time PCR assays have been reported for quantitative assessment of viral load in children naturally infected with RSV [51]. Multiplex, type-specific, real-time PCR assays have been reported for detection and quantification of respiratory adenoviruses [34, 52]. Quantitative real-time PCR assays have been used to assess influenza A virus infections, including the pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 virus [53, 54], but no correlation was established between viral loads and clinical severity or duration of disease. Quantification of viral load may help clinicians predict disease progression, interpret the clinical relevance of multiple viral pathogens detected in the same sample, and monitor the efficacy of antiviral therapy.",

Quantitative molecular assays make it possible to promptly establish the correlation between the viral load profile and clinical characteristics of viral respiratory infections, which would provide important knowledge for clinical management in terms of antiviral therapy and infection control measures. This has been supported by several recently published studies on the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus. Virological profile determined by quantitative RT-PCR suggested that the prolonged viral shedding in young children and higher viral load in the stool had implications for formulating clinical management policies and infection control measures [55]. It was also reported that oral oseltamivir suppressed viral load more effectively and shortened the duration of viral shedding when given early in mild cases of pandemic 2009 H1N1 infections [56, 57\u2022].",

Recent studies have reported the use of novel molecular methods to screen for the presence of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene [58\u201361]. In addition to accurate detection of the H275Y oseltamivir-resistance allele, samples collected at multiple time points even showed a switch from wild-type oseltamivir-sensitive 275 H to oseltamivir-resistant 275Y population after 9 days of treatment. In the light of emerging resistance, close monitoring and understanding of the nature and dynamics of resistance mutations in newly emerging strains should be a priority.",

Molecular methods can also provide a much shorter test turnaround time to accurate results, which is vital for timely and effective intervention during an outbreak of pandemic viral respiratory infections.

Multitargeted molecular assays are now becoming more cost-effective, with the increased cost of testing offset by a reduction in patient care cost due to an earlier diagnostic result provided by molecular methods. This economic advantage can be even more obvious for institutional outbreak and pandemic viral respiratory infections, in which time-to-result is of the most importance to prevent the spread of disease.

As techniques have advanced, a panel of viral pathogens now can be qualitatively and quantitatively detected in a single reaction, which significantly enhances diagnostic efficacy and yield. Implementation of molecular tests for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is limited by technical complexity, costs, and lack of proper validation and standardization of assays. The performance characteristics and limitations of these molecular tests must be clearly understood by laboratory personnel and clinicians to ensure proper utilization and interpretation.
