In addition, 60% reported the occurrence of wheeze of a few days duration, consistent with recent studies that have noted the involvement of the lower respiratory tract in some adults infected with RSV.\n4\n, \n7\n, \n14\n, \n15\n All recruits were absent from training for almost a week, most of whom were confined to the sickbay, illustrating the degree of morbidity associated with RSV infection in this population. Among the samples found to be positive for RSV by PCR or serology, viral culture failed to detect the virus, consistent with the present view that viral culture is not the optimum diagnostic test for detecting RSV in adults. The insensitivity of this technique and the poor correlation between the results of molecular and serological methods may be due to numerous factors including the shedding of low viral titres in respiratory secretions over short periods, the presence of inhibitors in such secretions, the extreme lability of the virus and sub\u2010optimal conditions for sample collection, storage and transportation. In addition, it has been shown that the serological response in young healthy adults to RSV may be diminished compared with the elderly, thus further supporting the current consensus that the combination of both PCR and serology is the optimal method for detecting RSV infection in this population.\n16\n A larger study would undoubtedly yield valuable information about the relationships between true infection, RSV isolation and the presence or absence and magnitude of the immune response as determined serologically. Finally, the overall incidence of RSV infection is likely to have been higher if recruits with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms were included in the study, which did not meet the more stringent case definition here.",

This is the first account of adenovirus\u2010associated respiratory illnesses in British military trainees. The observed prevalence is similar to that noted in recent studies of adenovirus infections at US military training centres,\n14\n, \n17\n but is significantly greater than estimates of such infections in civilian adults (2%).\n18\n In this study, most recruits experienced upper respiratory tract symptoms and some reported symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease including wheezing and dyspnoea. Furthermore, 21% of those with confirmed adenovirus infection were hospitalized with pneumonia. This is consistent with the view that infection with adenovirus is typically characterized by upper respiratory disease but may progress to involve the lower respiratory tract.\n18\n In addition, almost all of the trainees experienced absence from training and a considerable proportion (40%) were \u2018rolled\u2010back\u2019 to another unit for recycled training. Adenoviruses, particularly serotypes 4 and 7, have been recognized as an important cause of ARD among young adults undergoing basic military training since 1954, being consistently isolated from 30% to 70% of US military recruits with ARD.\n17\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n Large epidemics at training centres could incapacitate commands, halt training programmes and have serious repercussions on military readiness. In 1971, the US Department of Defense began routine administration of live attenuated vaccines against adenovirus types 4 and 7 to all military recruits with dramatic impact on recruit illness, reducing total respiratory disease rates by 50\u201360%, reducing adenovirus\u2010specific disease by 95\u201399% and promptly halting disease epidemics in recruits.\n17\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n In 1995 the sole manufacturer ceased production of adenoviral vaccines.\n17\n, \n26\n Following shelf\u2010life extensions and rationing of existing product, no vaccine has been available for use since early 1999.\n17\n As supplies gradually declined, outbreaks of adenoviral respiratory illness re\u2010emerged in US military training establishments and adenovirus morbidity has markedly increased. In view of the re\u2010emergence of adenovirus infection the US Department of Defense has contracted a new vaccine manufacturer to produce adenovirus 4 and 7 vaccines. The present study provides preliminary data for debate concerning the relevance of such a programme in British recruits.",

In most cases an acute upper respiratory tract illness resulted, although lower respiratory tract disease did occasionally occur. Almost all of the recruits experienced absence from training and a significant number were confined to the sickbay. Influenza is of particular importance in increased\u2010density populations, and as such, military populations are at high risk of infection. Inactivated influenza vaccines have been shown to be safe, immunogenic and highly efficacious at reducing febrile respiratory illness caused by influenza in adult populations.\n27\n In addition, influenza vaccination has been shown to be cost\u2010effective relative to providing either supportive care alone or treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors.\n28\n An influenza vaccination programme for military basic trainees is current policy in the USA (but not in the UK), in which a vaccine is administered within the first days of training. Although the efficacy of this programme in preventing influenzal infections in trainees may be considerable, this is dependent on congruity between vaccine and circulating strains which may, on occasion, be sub\u2010optimal.\n29\n\n",
