At cell culture level, expression of virus-specific single-chain antibodies inside host cells can interfere with virus multiplication within the cell7,8. The present study aimed to establish protection against an infectious pathogen in vivo by administration of antibody genes. The experimental model involved the fish rhabdovirus viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss ) as the host species9,10. As with the morphologically related mammalian rabies virus, studies have identified the viral glycoprotein G as the target of neutralizing antibodies11, and adoptive transfer of immunity can be obtained by intraperitoneal injection of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) before exposure to VHSV12.",

The variable parts of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chain genes were cloned13 and connected by a sequence encoding a 14\u2013amino acid flexible spacer. A constant-domain gene of the human Ig \u03ba-chain was added as a tag at the 3\u2032 end14. Upon expression in bacteria, the resulting ScAbs were able to neutralize VHSV (P. M. C., N. L. et al. unpublished data). Recombinant single-chain neutralizing antibodies have also been reported for several important mammalian viruses, including HIV-1 (ref. 15), rabies virus1, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)16. In the case of VSV, protective activity could furthermore be demonstrated in vivo, but because of the short half-life of the single-chain antibody molecules in circulation, protection was obtained only when the antibody was allowed to interact with the virus in vitro before inoculation of the mice16. Short half-life of neutralizing single-chain antibodies administered to mice before infection was correspondingly used to explain the lack of protection against exposure to a lethal coronavirus17. Here, we aimed at maintaining a stable level of circulating ScAb within the host over a longer period of time by inducing expression in vivo through administration of a plasmid-borne recombinant antibody gene, rather than delivery of the antibody itself. Such a strategy has earlier been suggested for cancer immunotherapy4 but has to our knowledge not been reported as a prophylactic measure.",

Single cells expressing ScAb could be detected in cultures transfected with pcDNA3-BU1 (Fig. 2A), but no such cells were present in cultures transfected with pcDNA3 (Fig. 2B). Virus-neutralizing activity with titers up to 32 in a plaque neutralization test12 could correspondingly be detected in supernatants from cell cultures transfected with pcDNA3-BU1, whereas no neutralizing activity (titers below 2) was found in supernatants from cultures transfected with pcDNA3. Exchange of the cell culture medium shortly before inoculation with VHSV eliminated the protective effect of transfection with pcDNA3-BU1 (data not shown).

The presence of ScAbs could later be demonstrated in muscle cells in tissue from fish injected with pcDNA3-BU1 ( Fig. 3), whereas no ScAbs were detected in the muscles of fish injected with pcDNA3. When plasma samples taken 12 days post injection were analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ScAbs recognizing VHSV, a positive signal was obtained only with samples from fish injected with pcDNA3-BU1. With the corresponding ScAb expressed in Escherichia coli as reference, the concentration of ScAb in the trout plasma was estimated to be 0.1\u20130.3 \u03bcg/ml. The same plasma samples were tested in a plaque neutralization assay12. Samples from 10 individuals injected with pcDNA3-BU1 all neutralized VHSV with titers ranging between 160 and 640, whereas no neutralizing activity was detected in plasma from 10 fish injected with the control plasmid. Unlike trout serum or plasma with neutralizing trout immunoglobulin10, the neutralization was independent of complement. To further verify that the observed activity was due to the presence of ScAbs in the plasma, a pool of plasma samples from fish injected with pcDNA3-BU1 was preincubated with rabbit Ig to human Ig \u03ba-chain (Ra-hum\u03ba) before testing in the virus neutralization assay. The ScAbs carried the constant part of the human Ig \u03ba-chain as a tag, and preincubation with Ra-hum\u03ba accordingly eliminated the neutralizing activity, whereas no effect was observed upon preincubation with normal rabbit serum or with rabbit serum to trout Ig. For comparison, the rabbit serum to trout Ig reduced the neutralizing activity of the serum from a fish immunized with inactivated VHSV more than 30-fold (Table 1). Furthermore, like the ScAb expressed in bacteria, plasma samples from fish injected with pcDNA3-BU1 could neutralize the virulent VHSV DK-3592B isolate, but not a neutralization escape-mutant of that isolate (DK-3592/p2) (data not shown).",

            "text": "Administration of an antibody gene in the form of naked DNA does not allow intracellular interference with virus multiplication throughout the body as reported for transformed cell cultures7, in that only a few of the animal's cells will take up the plasmids and express the antibody. However, by designing the gene for secretion of the antibody upon expression, we obtained a protective systemic level of recombinant antibody. The use of plasmid DNA circumvents the potentially hazardous use of live recombinant viral vectors often employed for transfer of antibody genes8,19,20. The duration of protection was not analyzed, but between day 18 and day 39 after injection of DNA, the plasma ScAb concentration remained stable in unchallenged fish kept at 16\u00b0C. In tissue samples taken at day 39, however, immunohistochemical analyses revealed the beginning of an inflammatory response and degradation of expressing cells at the site of injection, indicating that the ScAb-producing muscle cells were about to be eliminated. In fish transferred to 11\u00b0C at day 18, the plasma ScAb level at day 39 was approximately half that in the fish kept at 16\u00b0C. Reduced temperature thus appeared to negatively affect the balance between synthesis and clearance rate of the ScAbs. Although single-chain antibodies have low immunogenicity, persistence can probably be improved by use of species-homologous antibody genes. The minimal dose of the pcDNA3-BU1 construct needed to induce protection against VHSV in the fish remains to be determined, but will probably be above the nanogram level of plasmid DNA recently shown to be required for establishment of long-lasting immunity by a traditional DNA vaccine encoding the VHSV G protein21. In aquaculture, future prophylactic use of antibody genes may thus mainly be of practical interest for protection of fish against diseases for which no suitable vaccines are available. The technology may be used not only against viral pathogens as exemplified here by VHSV, but against any infection where immunity can be established by administration of pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies. One such example is the important \u201cwhite spot\u201d disease that afflicts a wide range of cultured and ornamental freshwater fish species and is caused by the parasitic ciliate Ichthyopthirius multifiliis22.",

            "text": "From a general veterinary viewpoint, development of transgenics harboring protective antibody genes in their germline may be considered. Such a strategy has already been successfully used in plants23. If delivery of naked DNA carrying antibody genes for immunoprophylaxis can be extended to mammals and to humans in particular, it may provide a valuable tool for transient protection of exposed individuals against pathogens or toxins when vaccination is not possible or not efficient (e.g., malaria, snake venoms). Similarly, it may be possible to induce antibodies of a desired specificity in immunodeficient individuals or in the case of risk of certain infections such as bacterial sepsis or infections with HIV where individuals themselves may tend to produce nonprotective antibodies24,25. Compared to the current practice of clinical administration of antiserum or Ig from human donors or immunized animals, use of plasmid DNA would eliminate the risk of concomitant transfer of infections. A possible drawback is that pathogen variability could overcome the immunity established by a single recombinant mAb, a problem that became evident in the virological examintions of survivors from the experiment illustrated in Figure 4. VHSV was isolated from some of the healthy survivors injected with pcDNA3-BU1, and one of these re-isolations was resistant to neutralization because of an amino acid substitution in the central variable region of the G protein (data not shown). To reduce the risk of insufficient protection, then, it may be preferable to administer either genes encoding a number of single-chain antibodies to different epitopes of the pathogen, or possibly even an entire single-chain antibody gene expression library toward a given pathogen. Other improvements at the molecular level may include incorporation of biological effector functions such as complement activation into the ScAbs. This would be particularly important for protection against pathogens such as Ebola virus where the subclass of the antibodies has appeared to be critical to the efficacy of the protection26.",

The VH domain segment was mutated in two positions giving amino acid substitutions N35T and K64T. These substitutions were based on the VH domain sequence of hybridoma 3F1A2 (ref.  13). Combination of the variable domains of hybridomas 3F1H10 and 3F1A2 was found to increase the neutralizing activity of the ScAb (P.M.C., N.L. et al., unpublished data).

Before challenge the fish were adapted to 11\u00b0C, and this temperature was kept throughout the 20- to 22-day challenge period.",
