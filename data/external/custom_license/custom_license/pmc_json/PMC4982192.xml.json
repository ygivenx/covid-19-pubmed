Although efforts have been made to adapt MERS-CoV itself to exhibit human disease phenotypes in rodents, greater success has been achieved through the development of specialized mouse models that express hDPP4 (20\u201322). Mouse strains that globally express hDPP4 are susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV, and the mice display lower respiratory tract infection, weight loss, and increased respiratory rate, but also encephalitis, which makes the strains highly lethal. Human DPP4 expression is, however, transient and limited to the lung after Ad5-hDPP4 transduction by intranasal inoculation (21). These infected transgenic mice exhibit transcriptional activation of genes encoding classic antiviral cytokines (interferon [IFN]-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and MX-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-12, p40, IL-1-\u03b1, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1), as well as chemokines (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10], CXC motif ligand 1 [CXCL-1], macrophage protein 1 [MIP-1], and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 [CCL5 or RANTES]), in contrast with the negligible gene activation of infected nontransgenic mice. IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, CXCL-1, MIP-1, RANTES, and interferon-induced GTP-binding protein (MX-1) have been detected in the lungs and brains of infected transgenic mice (20).",

Alternatively, a minimally modified version of mouse DPP4, by mutation of 2 amino acids, can support MERS-CoV infection. Mice with this mutation experience severe lower respiratory tract infection, although they do not exhibit brain infection (16). In addition, Pascal et al. have developed mice that express hDPP4, under the control of its endogenous promoter and the 3\u2032 untranslated region, and show lung-specific infection and inflammation (22). Further testing may prove that vaccine evaluation in these small animal models could lead to a better understanding of immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccine candidates and the therapeutic measures being considered for evaluation in larger animals and humans.",

However, not all research groups have been able to replicate severe disease outcomes in marmosets. Factors contributing to this could include variations in physical location, age, and origin of the marmosets; challenge virus strains and stocks; route and dose of inoculation; and in protocols. To be able to provide robust and reproducible outcomes, these nonhuman primate models need additional development, optimization, and standardization. ",

Although we do not know the efficiency of airborne versus droplet or another mode of transmission, viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract might explain the efficiency of camel\u2013camel and camel\u2013human transmission (11,26). Although camels do not display the severe disease symptoms observed in infected humans (26), a camel infection model remains useful for understanding the disease in camels and identifying potential immune correlates of protection induced by vaccination. Veterinary countermeasures could form part of a One Health strategy to forestall zoonotic transmission to humans (1). Hesitation to implement animal vaccination strategies in camels once a vaccine becomes available can be attributed to the absence of severe disease in camels (only upper respiratory tract infection with rhinitis) and to skepticism among key groups regarding zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV to humans (e.g., camel breeders).",

Enjuanes and others reported to the group the development of 2 engineered MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. One candidate was based on a propagation-defective MERS-CoV strain, and another was a live attenuated virus with 3 safety guards that used a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA clone (47).

Because these NAbs target epitopes of the S protein (or specifically the receptor-binding domain), they can cause precise and potent inhibitory effects on viral entry in small and large animal models (53). The mechanisms of neutralization have been uncovered and are typically mediated by blocking MERS-CoV binding to hDPP4 (22,52,54\u201356). As the supplementary agents of antibodies, the peptidic MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors targeting the conserved region in the S protein HR1 domain region are highly potent in inhibiting infection of MERS-CoV strains, including those resistant to NAbs. Intranasal administration of the peptides protected hDPP4-transgenic mice from MERS-CoV challenge, suggesting that, alone or in combination with NAbs, these peptides could be used to prevent and treat MERS-CoV infection (37,39,57).",

In mice and hamsters vaccinated with a recombinant native full-length SARS-CoV S protein trimer, serum IgG developed that blocked binding of the S protein to the ACE2 receptor and neutralized SARS-CoV infection in vitro. SARS-CoV entered human B-cell lines in an Fc\u03b3RII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion, indicating that antibody-dependent enhancement of virus entry is a novel cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV. Vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis, and viral load was undetectable or greatly reduced in lungs after challenge with SARS-CoV (64). However, in the presence or absence of adjuvant, vaccination of mice with viruslike particles or inactivated virus induced eosinophilic immunopathologic changes in young and aged mice (65\u201367). The pulmonary immunopathologic features, on challenge with SARS-CoV, were associated with Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration.
