In February 2014, this novel porcine coronavirus was detected in pigs in Ohio, United States (2), and has since been reported in at least 17 US states (3\u20135). Concern regarding the epidemiology, evolution, and pathogenicity of this emerging virus is increasing. Recently, PDCoV was identified in South Korea (6). We report PDCoV in mainland China. ",

(2), we tested 215 intestinal or fecal samples collected at various times during 2004\u20132014 from piglets with clinical diarrhea in Anhui, Guangxi, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces, mainland China (Technical Appendix Table 1). All samples were submitted from commercial pig farms to our laboratory for enteropathogen detection. Of these samples, 165 (124 from Hubei, 41 from Jiangsu) had been collected in 2014, and 50 (40 from Jiangsu, 6 from Anhui, 4 from Guangxi) had been collected during 2004\u20132013 and preserved in our laboratory. The 215 samples were simultaneously tested for PEDV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by using the primers listed in Technical Appendix Table 2. Of the samples tested, 14 (6.51%) were positive for PDCoV, 110 (51.2%) were positive for PEDV, and 5 (2.3%) were positive for TGEV. Of the 14 PDCoV-positive samples, 7 (50%) were also positive for PEDV; 2 of the 215 samples were co-infected with PEDV, TGEV, and PDCoV (Technical Appendix Table 1). Previous studies have shown that prevalence of PDCoV in the midwestern United States in 2014 was high (30%) and that PDCoV co-infections with other pathogens (such as PEDV and rotavirus) are more common (78% of PDCoV infections) (4). At the same time in mainland China, the rate of PDCoV positivity was lower (7.27%), whereas that of PEDV was higher (52.73%), suggesting that PEDV remains the main causative agent of piglet diarrhea diseases in mainland China. Similarly, in South Korea in 2014, only 2 PDCoV-positive samples were detected in 113 samples of diarrhea from pigs (6).",
