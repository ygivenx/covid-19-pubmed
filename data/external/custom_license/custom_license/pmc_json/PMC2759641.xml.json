Clinical findings in 8 of the patients have been described previously.[18] Ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children, 4 girls and 8 boys, were infected by mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1. They were initially diagnosed between 1996 and 2002 at age 3-64 (median, 32) months and they have been followed for 9-61 (median, 44) months (Table). At the time of diagnosis, 9 children had low CD4+ cell counts (compared with the age-specific normal range[19]) and the median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 500,000 copies/mL (110,000-1,300,000). All children had lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly at diagnosis. One girl (patient 3) developed NKT-cell lymphoma which caused her death, the only fatality during the study period. Most of the patients had infectious complications, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (1), viral pneumonia (1), disseminated Penicillium marneffei (1), thrush (4), tinea capitis (1), and herpes simplex (1). Other complications included neutropenia in 1 patient, hepatitis and anemia in 1, and asthma and/or rhinitis in 3. Patients were started on HAART immediately after confirmation of HIV-1 infection and were treated with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine, lamivudine, didanosine, stavudine, and/or abacavir) plus 1 protease inhibitor (indinavir, nelfinavir, Kaletra (lopinavir + ritonavir), ritonavir, or amprenavir) or the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine. Details are given in the Table. Patients were examined and blood for hematologic, virologic, and immunologic evaluation was taken every 2-6 months. The first cytokine evaluation was performed within 1 month of starting HAART in 7 patients, within 2-4 months in 3 patients, and after 16 and 19 months in 2 patients.",

We also looked for correlations between cytokine production, viral load, and CD4+ cell numbers in the hope of identifying cytokine profiles associated with favorable outcome. However, we were limited to only 12 HIV-infected children available for study in Hong Kong, and statistical bias could have occurred due to heterogeneity with regard to immunologic maturity at the time of diagnosis, duration of infection with HIV-1, and extent of immunodeficiency when starting HAART.",

It is impossible to distinguish between the possibility that high levels of virus suppressed production of these cytokines and/or that virus survived better when production of these cytokines was limited. In contrast to our findings, a previous study reported that plasma IL-10 declined during adequate virologic and immunologic responses in HAART-treated adults.[28] Differences in race and age of patients in the 2 studies may have contributed to these conflicting findings. Also in contrast to our study, IFN-gamma[29]and TNF-alpha[29,30] declined during adequate virologic and immunologic responses in HAART-treated adults. However, Reuben and colleagues[31] found increased plasma IFN-gamma after virus suppression in pediatric patients and Resino and coworkers[32] found lower PHA-induced TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in rapid-progressor children than in those who were long-term asymptomatic. It is therefore possible that these cytokines may interact differently with HIV in children and adults. It should also be borne in mind that enumeration of cytokine-secreting cells following in vitro mitogen stimulation of isolated PBMCs is unlikely to compare directly with cytokine quantitation in plasma.",

It was not ethically feasible to have either a healthy matched pediatric control group or an untreated pediatric HIV control group in the present study, so we were limited to a comparison of cytokine profiles in individual patients at times of relatively good and poor health and of improving or worsening CD4+ cell counts or viral loads. We were unable to identify cytokine profiles that were associated with or predictive of HIV-related clinical events.
