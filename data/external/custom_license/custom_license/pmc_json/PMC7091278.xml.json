            "text": "Ebola is one of the deadliest and infectious virus which spreads rapidly and affects a large volume of the population. The Ebola virus (EboV) spreads among people through contacts with an infected person and causes a severe viral hemorrhagic fever along with other symptoms such as nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia, and sore throat (Sureau 1989). The incubation period of EVD varies from 2 to 21 days and in severe forms of the disease, death may occur within 5\u201310 days after onset of illness (Tseng and Chan 2015). According to the World Health Organization (WHO 2016), a total of 28,601 Ebola cases has been detected in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone and out of them, 11,300 cases reported death by January 2016. Healthcare professionals who are engaged in the treatment of EVD patients unknowingly contracted the virus from such patients and then further facilitate infection transmission (William et al. 2014). In a study conducted by Lehmann et al. (2016) observed that the healthcare professionals hesitate to associate with EVD patients due to high risk of infection. In 2014, EVD outbreaks in West Africa is the largest episodes having a fatality rate of 76.4 % (Fasina et al. 2015). The EVD has the large epidemic potential of the outbreak, which results in the rise in the number of EVD cases and might be transmitted from one country to another. The EVD patients can be cured by proper educational campaigns and treatment as in the case of the French nurse cured from EboV (Rachah and Torres 2016). The continuous monitoring of outbreak moves the attention from disease to prediction and prevention of the virus from spreading. Hence, there is a need of using both antiviral drugs or vaccines as well as IT-based strategies to reduce its harmful effects.",

The existing healthcare systems are unable to control and monitor such diseases efficiently accompanying with minimal cost. So, an intelligent and efficient system is required to provide ubiquitous healthcare support services in real time using IT infrastructure. A major challenge in any nationwide healthcare systems is the acquisition of health-related information from the patient in real time and requirement of huge storage capacity and high computational power to store and process the data respectively. Recent advances in sensing and distributed technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing makes it possible to design a smart healthcare system that enables remote continuous monitoring of patients in an unobtrusive and seamless manner. Using such technologies, it not only reduces consumed manpower of health workers but also reduce the cost of medical healthcare services.",

To control the spread of the disease, the close proximity interactions between infected and uninfected users needs to be prevented. For this purpose, RFID technology is used to sense the CPIs between users. To store and process such huge sensor data from a large number of affected population in a specific region such as city, state or country in real time, dedicated and scalable resources are required to save millions of lives. Cloud computing provides massive computing power, high scalability, and immense storage. Hence, the integration of WBAN, RFID, and cloud infrastructure can provide highly reliable healthcare system for monitoring and detection of EboV at its initial stages.",

The proposed system will keep track of the current status of the outbreak and identify the infected users responsible for the spread of the disease. To achieve these objectives, real time Ebola diagnosis and monitoring system is proposed based on IoT, RFID, mobile phone, and cloud computing infrastructure is proposed. Initially, each patient is registered through a mobile application by entering personal and contact information. The system automatically generates a unique identification number (UID) and is allocated to each registered patient. The UID is used for all the future communications between patients, doctors, and the hospitals. The data of EVD symptoms from body sensors in digital form is collected through patient\u2019s mobile phone using the Bluetooth technology. The stream data is continuously collected and stored in the cloud database for in-depth analysis. Data is classified using J48 decision tree which categorizes the users into six categories based on their respective symptoms. Once the users are classified into different categories, they are monitored continuously using WBAN and RFID. RFID senses the close proximity interaction between infected and uninfected patients and an alert message is generated and sent to the uninfected patient to avoid such contacts with infected patients. Several outbreak metrics such as clustering coefficient, centrality, and temporal path length are computed using Temporal Network Analysis (TNA).",

This algorithm is applied periodically for the monitoring of any change in the categories of the users.We proposed the use of a RFID technology for capturing the close proximity interactions between users. An alert message is generated by the system and is sent to the mobile phone of an uninfected user to avoid his contact with the infected user.We proposed a Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) to generate a graph showing the contacts between infected and uninfected users. Using TNA metrics, the infected users or regions are identified that are involved in the spread of the disease.We provided a detailed experimental testing of the proposed model on Amazon EC2 cloud in order to evaluate its performance and accuracy. Our model provides 94 % classification accuracy and 92 % utilization of cloud resources.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews related work on EboV infection and use of sensor technology and cloud computing in the detection and monitoring of EVD patients. A model to monitor and detect the EboV is proposed in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents RFID-based prevention of EVD outbreak. In Sect. 5, we present and analyze the experimental results of our proposed model. Section 6 offers conclusions coming out of this model and possibilities for future work.",

Many authors studied the cause, effect and precaution measures of the 1976 attack. The history, epidemiology and infection cycle of the EboV has been analyzed in Guenno and Galabru (1997). They identified the initial symptoms and effects on the human body. Takada and Kawaoka (2001) examined the pathogenesis of EboV infection and the available vaccines and effective therapies. Park et al. (2015) performed an evaluation of sequences from 232 EboV infected patients in Sierra Leona and analyzed viral evolution during prolonged transmission between users. Matua et al. (2015) performed in-depth analysis on strategies used to control the spread of the outbreak and proposed new techniques to improve the management and control of EboV during future outbreaks. Edelsburg and Shir-Raz (2015) examined the role of media in the spread of disease in such a crisis situation. Moghadam et al. (2015) conducted another review of the different species and structures of the EboV. Liu et al. (2015a, b) reviewed the techniques that were used to deal with plague epidemic occurred in Northeast China. The authors made an effort to highlight the valuable experience that can be used to fight the current Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Passerini et al.

A data mining software Weka 3.6 (Hall et al. 2009) containing a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks, is used to generate the J48 decision tree. As shown in Fig. 2 generated by Weka 3.6, each user is categorized as infected under category S if he has no infection and having a low-level immunity along with a cough or a sore throat. The category E of the infected patient shows mild fever along with a cough or a sore throat. During this phase, the level of infection in the body of the patient is low. However, if fever and sore throat are high along with secondary symptoms such as a headache, body ache, then the patient is infectious and the category of infection will be I. In this stage, the patient absorbs sufficiently large infection that can be transmitted to other susceptible individuals. In category H, the infected patients show severe symptoms along with symptoms of category I. Finally, once the patient\u2019s immune system has cleared the parasite or infection and the patient are no longer infectious and comes under the category recovered (R). The user is treated as uninfected if he does not possess any of the above conditions. The life cycle of EVD moving through different states is shown in Fig. 3.\n\n",

With the help of TNA graph, the evolution of epidemic spread can be predicted and the infected users that are highly responsible for the spread of the disease can also be identified. Gephi 0.9.1 (Fu et al. 2016) is used to generate TNA graph. Gephi is an open-source software for visualizing and analyzing temporal networks graphs. Gephi uses a 3D render engine to display graphs in real time and speed up the exploration.

AWS offers three usage tiers: on-demand, one year reserved, and three-year reserved at a very reasonable price. In order to deploy our proposed model, Amazon offers EC2 service for virtual computer rental (known as instances) with a variety of hardware specifications. The most basic instance is a single-core CPU with 1 Gbyte of RAM, priced at US $0.013 per hour (Amazon EC2 2016). The cost of RFID tags have fallen significantly over the past few years, which varies from $0.05\u20130.07 (RFID 2016).

Unlike traditional offline models, our approach is based on capturing the real time close proximity contacts and health information so as to control the epidemic spreading. The J48 decision tree is used to classify the users into different categories. TNA is used to represent each Ebola infected users on the TNA graph. Different temporal metrics are computed to identify those infected individuals or regions that are highly involved in the spreading of epidemics. The proposed model is tested on Amazon EC2 cloud which provides 94 % classification accuracy and around 92 % utilization of cloud resource. Sometimes, the users are not willing to carry RFID tags and body sensors.
