Therefore, research on coronaviruses had been mostly of veterinary\ninterest, but this changed recently with the emergence of two highly pathogenic\nhuman coronaviruses causing severe pneumonia epidemics. First, the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) appeared in 2002, and then the Middle\nEast respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) appeared in 2012. Both viruses have\na zoonotic origin, showing that this virus family is a reservoir of emerging\npathogens, especially because of their high interspecies transmission (3).",

            "text": "The M protein is the most abundant protein of the envelope (10). Its length ranges from 217 to 230 amino acid residues in\nmost coronaviruses, but it can go up to 270 residues in some coronaviruses\n(bottlenose dolphin coronavirus). It is a protein with three membrane-spanning\nhydrophobic segments, a small N-terminal domain located outside the virion (or\ninside the lumen of intracellular organelles), and a large C-terminal domain that\nmakes up half of the protein, inside the virion (or in the cytoplasm of infected\ncells) (10). M proteins of some\nalphacoronaviruses contain an additional hydrophobic segment that functions as a\nsignal peptide. The M protein is invariably glycosylated on its N-terminal domain.\nHowever, there are differences in the type of glycosylation. The murine hepatitis\nvirus (MHV) and some other Betacoronavirus M proteins are\nO-glycosylated, whereas Alpha- and\nDeltacoronavirus M proteins are modified with\nN-linked sugars. The glycosylation is dispensable for virus\nassembly (11). The M protein is considered to\nbe the motor of the assembly of viral particles because it is able to interact with\nall of the other structural proteins (12\u201314). Important M\u2013M interactions have also been demonstrated\nduring assembly (15, 16). For many coronaviruses, including the transmissible\ngastroenteritis virus, MHV, and IBV, the co-expression of M and E proteins in cells\nis sufficient to induce the production of virus-like particles (17\u201319), indicating that\nthese proteins are essential and sufficient to the assembly step. Only for SARS-CoV,\nthe nucleocapsid protein has been shown to be additionally required for the\nproduction of virus-like particles (20). EM\nobservations have shown that coronaviruses bud inside the ER\u2013Golgi\nintermediate compartment (ERGIC) (21, 22) and then travel through the Golgi. Although\nthe assembly step of coronaviruses occurs in the ERGIC compartment, it has been\nshown for several coronaviruses that the M protein expressed alone in cells can go\nbeyond the assembly site in the secretory pathway (21). However, the subcellular localization of the M protein varies\nbetween the different coronavirus species. Indeed, MHV M protein can reach the\ntrans-Golgi network (TGN), whereas IBV-M protein is retained in\nthe ERGIC and one or two cisternae of the cis-Golgi (21, 23,\n24). The intracellular retention of IBV-M\nhas been attributed to the first membrane-spanning segment and particularly to polar\nresidues located within this domain (25,\n26). For MHV, both the TM1 and the last\n22 amino acids seem to be important determinants for the intracellular localization\nof the protein (27). The aim of this study\nwas to investigate the subcellular localization of the MERS-M protein and to\ncharacterize the signals involved in its trafficking.",

To analyze the intracellular\ntrafficking of the MERS-CoV M protein, we transfected a vector expressing the\nMERS-CoV M protein with a HA tag fused at its N terminus (HA-MERS-M) in HeLa\ncells and compared the protein localization with different compartment markers\nusing immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B). As observed in Fig. 1B, MERS-CoV M shows a good\ncolocalization with TGN46 that localizes in the trans-Golgi\nnetwork. We confirmed this colocalization by co-transfection of the M protein\nwith the GFP fused to the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of the\ncation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (GFP-CI-MPR). This reporter has\nbeen shown to be localized in the TGN in HeLa cells (28). The images were then analyzed using ImageJ to\ncalculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for each co-staining (Fig. 1C). The PCC measures\nthe pixel-by-pixel covariance of the signal levels of two images (29). The PCC values range from \u22121 to\n1. A PCC value of 1 is obtained for two images whose intensities of fluorescence\nare linearly and perfectly related, whereas a value of \u22121 means that the\nintensities are inversely related to one another. Values near 0 mean that the\nintensities are uncorrelated. Our results confirm the localization of MERS-CoV M\nin the TGN with a PCC of 0.878 (\u00b10.014) and 0.852 (\u00b10.012) for the\nMERS-CoV M with TGN46 and GFP-CI-MPR markers, respectively. The PCCs for\nMERS-CoV M and CD4 (a cell surface marker) or the calreticulin (an ER marker)\nare below 0.4.

The deletion\nof the last 20 residues of the MERS-CoV M protein (M\u039420) produced mutants\nthat were no longer localized in the TGN (Fig.\n2A). Moreover, it induced a different intracellular\nlocalization, depending on the tag used. Indeed, HA-M\u039420 co-localizes with\ncalreticulin, the ER marker, as shown by the double labeling in Fig. 2B, whereas\nM\u039420-VSVG was located at the cell surface, as shown by the double labeling\nof M\u039420-VSVG and CD4 (Fig.\n2C). We measured the extent of colocalization for\nHA-M\u039420 or M\u039420-VSVG with the ER, TGN, or cell surface marker by\nmeasuring the PCC (Fig.\n2D). The WT protein presented a PCC of 0.905 \u00b1\n0.007 for TGN46 and of 0.296 \u00b1 0.014 and 0.239 \u00b1 0.017 for CRT and\nCD4, respectively. The HA-M\u039420 protein showed a decrease of the PCC for\nTGN46 (0.369 \u00b1 0.019) associated with an increase of the PCC with CRT\n(0.855 \u00b1 0.011). The HA-M\u039420 also showed a moderate increase in cell\nsurface localization with a PCC for CD4 of 0.539 \u00b1 0.018. The PCC between\nM\u039420-VSVG and TGN46 was also strongly decreased (0.331 \u00b1 0.025);\nhowever, the M\u039420-VSVG protein presented a strong increase of the PCC for\nCD4 (0.79 \u00b1 0.016) and a moderate increase of the PCC for CRT (0.475 \u00b1\n0.018). These results suggest that important intracellular trafficking motifs\nare present in the distal part of the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M. Analysis\nof the sequence of the last 20 residues showed that the deleted sequence\ncontains a potential diacidic ER export signal at positions 211\u2013213\n(211DIE213). This signal was first characterized for\nthe glycoprotein of VSV and is indeed present in the VSVG tag\n(YTDIEMNRLGK) used in our experiments. It is likely\nthat a blockade of ER export arose from the deletion in HA-M\u039420 and the\nloss of the DxE signal; however, the addition of the VSVG tag in the\nM\u039420-VSVG protein restored the signal and rescued the ER export. Moreover,\nthe M\u039420-VSVG protein was mainly located at the cell surface instead of\nbeing retained in TGN, suggesting that the distal part of the C-terminal domain\nof the M protein also contains a determinant responsible for its localization in\nthe TGN.",

            "text": "The presence of the DxE signal explained the exit of the M protein from the ER\nbut not its retention in the trans-Golgi, because it is\ncommonly accepted that in nonpolarized cells, the constitutive secretory pathway\nleads to the plasma membrane by default (i.e. in absence of\nspecific addressing/retention signals). Considering that and the fact that the\nM\u039420-VSVG protein migrates to the cell surface, we looked for the presence\nof another signal in the last 20 amino acids of the cytosolic tail, which could\nbe involved in the retention of MERS-CoV M in the TGN compartment. For this\npurpose, we constructed three smaller C-terminal deletion mutants lacking 5, 10,\nor 15 residues but keeping the VSVG tag to rescue the ER export. These mutants\nwere called M\u03945, M\u039410, and M\u039415. We then compared the\nsubcellular localization of these mutants with the WT and M\u039420 M proteins\n(Fig. 3, A\u2013C).\nSimilar to what was observed for the WT M and in contrast to M\u039420 protein,\nthe M\u03945, M\u039410, and M\u039415 proteins co-localized with the TGN46\nmarker, indicating that the 5-amino acid sequence AGNYR, located between the\n\u039420 and \u039415 deletions, is likely involved in the specific\nlocalization of the protein in the TGN. To identify the residues involved in the\nTGN localization of the protein, each amino acid (except the alanine) was\nmutated individually into alanine in the M\u039415 protein. M\u039415-G201A,\nM\u039415-N202A, M\u039415-Y203A, and M\u039415-R204A were expressed in HeLa\ncells, and the subcellular localization of the proteins was analyzed by\nfluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). The\nproteins carrying the mutation G201A, Y203A, or R204A showed a reduced\ncolocalization with the TGN46 marker compared with the M\u039415 (Fig. 4, A and\nC), with partial export of the protein to the cell surface\n(Fig. 4, B and\nC). This difference in intracellular trafficking is\nillustrated by a decrease of PCC between the M mutants and TGN46 associated with\nan increase of the PCC with CD4. These results indicate a role of these three\nresidues in the localization of the protein in the TGN. The mutation N202A had\nno effect on the subcellular localization of the protein compared with the WT.\nTo confirm these results, the mutation G201A, Y203A, or R204A was also inserted\ninto the full-length protein. Analysis of the subcellular localization of these\nmutants is shown in Fig. 5. M-G201A,\nM-Y203A, and M-R204A showed a reduced co-localization with TGN46 compared with\nthe WT M-VSVG and an increase of cell surface expression, resulting in an\nincrease of the PCC between the mutant and CD4. To ensure that we identified the\nfull motif involved in the TGN localization of the protein, we also mutated\nthree conserved residues (Tyr-195, Arg-197, or Lys-199) among the\nbetacoronaviruses located upstream of the \u039420 deletion. Interestingly,\nmutation of the residue Lys-199 also resulted in an increase of the cell surface\nexpression of the protein (Fig. 5).",

A second band of \u223c30 kDa and a third more\ndiffuse band migrating more slowly were also observed.

Only one band was observed with the\nDxE mutant with a high intensity at 30 kDa sensitive to EndoH. The EndoH\nsensitivity of the 30 kDa band likely reflects the accumulation of this protein\nin the ER due to the lack of export signal.

The subcellular\nlocalization of the chimeric proteins was then analyzed by fluorescence\nmicroscopy. As shown in Fig. 8, the\nimmunofluorescent staining of IBV-M and MERS-CoV M differed in their pattern,\nwith a compact perinuclear staining for MERS-CoV M and a punctuated staining for\nIBV-M. Co-localization assessment of IBV-M with TGN46 and ERGIC-53 showed that\nthe protein mainly localizes within the ERGIC. The MERS-M/IBV-M protein\ncolocalized with the ERGIC-53 marker and not the TGN46 marker, and is thus\nlocated in the ERGIC (Fig.\n8C), whereas the IBV-M/MERS-M protein colocalized\nwith the TGN46 marker and not with the ERGIC-53 marker and is thus localized in\nthe TGN. In other words, the switch of the C-terminal domains of the IBV-M and\nMERS-CoV M proteins caused a switch of their specific localizations, to the\nERGIC and the TGN, respectively. Interestingly, the IBV-M/MERS-KGYR protein\nlocalized to the cell surface, confirming the role of the KxGxYR signal in the\nspecific localization of the MERS-M protein to the TGN.

(39) reported\nthat oligomerization of MHV-M protein is involved in the TGN retention of the\nprotein; however, our results show that it is unlikely that the KxGxYR motif is\ninvolved in the oligomerization of the protein. As a small proportion of the\nMERS-CoV M protein could be detected at the cell surface (less than 1% of the total\nprotein; see Fig. 6, A and\nB), we tested whether the KxGxYR motif could be an endocytosis\nmotif. The MERS-CoV M protein is retrieved from the cell surface by endocytosis;\nhowever, we could not detect any defect of endocytosis of the M protein when the\nKxGxYR motif was mutated (Fig. 6,\nE and F). This result argues against an\nendocytic function of this motif and suggests a role as a retention signal. Indeed,\nit was reported previously (27) that the\nMHV-M protein does not cycle between the plasma membrane of the cell and the TGN but\nrather acts as a TGN-resident protein. Another hypothesis is a cycle of the M\nbetween the ER and the TGN with the KxGxYR motif acting as a retrieval signal from\nthe TGN to the ER. The mutation of this signal would inhibit the retrieval of the\nprotein, allowing its trafficking to the cell surface. The retrograde trafficking\nensures the constant recycling of proteins and lipids from the Golgi to the ER to\nmaintain their steady-state distribution and the composition and function of the\norganelles themselves. Two distinct mechanisms are responsible for this retrograde\ntransport. The first one depends on the coat protein complex I (COPI), and the\nsecond one is the COPI-independent pathway that is less characterized, involves the\nRab6 GTPase, and is composed of tubular rather than vesicular carriers (40). The formation of the COPI-coated vesicles\nstarts with the recruitment en bloc of the coatomer composed of seven subunits by\nthe Arf1 GTPase. Cargos carry specific signals in their cytosolic-exposed domain\nmediating their recruitment by COPI. The best characterized motifs are the di-lysine\nmotifs KKxx or KxKxx that are recognized by the \u03b1-COP or \u03b2\u2032-COP\nsubunit of the coatomer. Multimeric proteins, such as receptors or channels, contain\nan arginine-based sorting signal (\u03c6RxR, where \u03c6 represents any\nhydrophobic amino acid). A common feature of the motif involved in the protein\nsorting toward the COPI-dependent pathway is the presence of basic residues. Because\nof its content in basic residues, the KxGxYR motif might be recognized by the COPI\nmachinery to prevent its cell surface expression.",

As mentioned above, the\ntransmembrane domain and an endocytic motif cooperate for the proper localization of\nTGN38/46. The Golgi apparatus is a compartmentalized structure where glycosylation\noccurs in an ordered process (41). The\nsuccessful completion of glycosylation relies in part on the proper distribution of\nglycosyltransferases along the Golgi that will permit their action in a sequential\nmanner. Most of the glycosyltransferases are type II transmembrane proteins. They\nconsist of a short N-terminal domain exposed in the cytosol, a transmembrane domain,\na stem region, and an enzymatic domain. The nonuniform distribution of these enzymes\nin the Golgi is likely maintained by a combination of retention and recycling\nmechanisms (42). The mechanisms that ensure\nthe localization of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi are numerous and diverse.\nThese include the oligomerization status of the enzyme and complex formation, the\nlength of the transmembrane domain but also its composition, which may affect the\nway it is interacting with the different lipid compositions that the protein\nencounters in the different Golgi cisternae. The cytosolic domains also contain\nmotifs involved in the localization of the enzymes (42).",

Indeed, IBV-M is mainly expressed in the ERGIC and\ncis-Golgi compartment. Previous studies reported the role of\nthe first transmembrane segment in the intracellular retention of the protein (26). This was shown by the replacement of the\ntransmembrane domain of the glycoprotein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG)\nwith the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M, which resulted in the intracellular\nretention of the protein, and four polar residues were shown to mediate this\nretention (25). Surprisingly, when we\nreplaced the first membrane-spanning domain of MERS-CoV M with that of IBV-M in the\ncontext where the KxGxYR motif is mutated into alanine residues\n(TM1-IBV/MERS-M-KGYR), the protein was not located in the ERGIC but was still\ntransported to the cell surface. This difference may lie in the use of a full-length\ncoronavirus M protein instead of a reporter protein such as VSVG. Interestingly,\nwhen we swapped the C-terminal domains of the proteins, we also switched their\nspecific localizations, suggesting that the IBV-M C-terminal domain contains a\nsignal(s) for the ERGIC localization of the protein and not the first membrane\nsegment as reported previously.",
