Real-time PCR has truly changed the molecular diagnostic scene and must be considered as one of the more important developments during the last few years. The various real-time PCR platforms and their respective chemistries, such as Taqman\u00ae, molecular beacons, primer probe energy transfer (PriProET), scorpion primers, dual probe systems, such as those utilized in the LightCycler\u00ae (Roche, NJ, USA), dye-labeled oligonucleotide ligation and SYBR Green, have showed high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of viral and bacterial pathogens [6\u201312]. Compared with the \u2018classical\u2019 single, nested or ELISA PCR platforms, real-time PCR assays offer a number of important, well-known advantages:\n\u2022 Faster and higher throughput assays;\u2022 One-step amplification set-up that provides sensitivity and specificity close or equal to traditional nested PCR;\u2022 Detection of amplified products measured online and in real-time through the lid, side or bottom of the reaction vessel without opening the system, thus minimizing the risk of contaminating the laboratory environment, or carryover into nearby samples;\u2022 Post-PCR handling of the amplicons/products is not required (i.e., the contamination risk posed by postamplification products are minimized);\u2022 Output is not only positive or negative but enables a quantitative estimation of target or input nucleic acid in the sample;\u2022 Hands-on time is greatly reduced, compared with traditional detection using agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide or GelRed\u2122 staining;\u2022 Practical to automate with the use of a 96-well microtiter plate format, without the need for nested PCR;\u2022 High throughput potential due to robotic automation on both the sample extraction and the sample processing/amplification sides;\u2022 Probes can be labeled with a number of different fluorophores that function as individual reporter dyes for different primer sets. Thus, it is suitable for the development of multiplex PCR systems;\u2022 Lower costs per detected agent, if the equipment can be used for a large number of samples.

Currently, TaqMan and molecular beacons are the most commonly used real-time PCR chemistries in routine diagnostic laboratories [10] and, therefore, this article will focus on these, but will include other exciting approaches, such as the PriProET and light-upon-extension (LUX) systems [14\u201316].",

These platforms will increasingly be commercialized as early, rapid, onsite and high-throughput systems. The specification of the real-time PCR platform, such as TaqMan or molecular beacons, is important, considering that the various platforms and chemistries have different strengths and weaknesses, such as detection range, sensitivity, specificity and sensitivity to mismatch, which influence the platforms results. It is important to note that, even within the same platform of real-time PCR or similar real-time PCR chemistries, differences can, and will, occur within and between laboratories [7]. This variation has been highlighted with various TaqMan assays developed for the detection of the same virus that can differ with regards to diagnostic specificity, sensitivity and other important assay parameters [17,18]. Therefore, it is important to clearly specify the exact real-time PCR platform, chemistry and assay concerned and to provide very exact specifications for the applied method in order to avoid confusion and misunderstanding between results.",

Thus, it is not feasible to believe that molecular diagnostic laboratories will set up the recommended assays in exactly the same way. Some adaptation to various nucleic acid extractions, real-time PCR machines or PCR kits will always be the case, further underlying the importance of community reference laboratories and annual proficiency testing. It is also important to note that reference samples are available to laboratories in need to adapt assays to their own work processes. Not all laboratories are going to use the exact same reaction conditions but it is very important that the resulting varieties of assays will result in comparable assay characteristics in each diagnostic laboratory.",

This indicates very high analytical sensitivity and specificity, with the majority of the platforms being able to exclusively detect and amplify the selected target nucleic acids where crossreactivity could be a factor in the diagnosis. However, wide-spectrum, pan- or general PCR assays, for example, the pan-pesti PCR assays, which amplify very conservative regions of the pestivirus genomes (e.g., selected regions from the 5\u00b4NCR) and are able to amplify all tested pestiviruses, such as BVDV, classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and border disease virus [11], are useful where a wider range of targets can be expected or the exact causative agent is not known [18]. One strategy of laboratory diagnostic analysis could be to use an arsenal of wide-range (general) real-time PCR assays for preliminary screening of the samples [19] as a first line of detection, while the exact identification/characterization of the detected pathogens is made by narrower-range, highly specific PCR assays. These assays not only allow for the exact identification of the virus variant(s) but also allow for its molecular epidemiological characterization [9,10].",

            "text": "The gel-based PCR platforms facilitated the development of multiplex PCR assays but the advent of real-time PCR platforms provided an important high-throughput tool in a diagnostic laboratory\u2019s arsenal. This development was possible as all the individual and specific probes used for the component assays can be labeled with a different fluorophores, each of which function as a specific-color reporter dye for one set of primers. Since the fluorescent probes emit at different color wavelengths, it enables multiplexing of the assays [10,20\u201323]. Compared with single-target PCR platforms, construction of multiplex platforms can be rather complex, considering the large number of oligonucleotides required to hybridize to different targets with different empiric values [6]. The multiplex real-time PCR platform has the potential to produce considerable savings in time and effort, without compromising the robustness and sensitivity of virus detection assays [10]. However, the competition of \u2018in-test-tube\u2019 oligonucleotides frequently hinders the development of potent multiplex PCR platforms and, therefore, necessitates an optimal primer/probe design with as few crossreaction possibilities as possible. \u2018Primer competition\u2019 could lead to a decrease in the levels of specificity and sensitivity of the PCR platform and, in certain cases, the system will simply not work at all in a multiplex arrangement.",

Since zinc-finger proteins can directly detect PCR products and can double-check the specific PCR amplification and sequence specificity of the PCR products, this novel method has great potential and has enabled the detection for three pathogens, Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella spp. and influenza A virus, in a multiplex format. Many such advances have been published recently, and it takes a matrix of scientific and commercial entities to work together to ensure the sustainable development of these platforms into the diagnostic market.

The test is called the AmpliChip\u00ae Cytochrome P450 Genotyping Test (Roche Molecular Systems Inc., CA, USA) and was cleared for use with the GeneChip\u00ae Microarray Instrumentation System (Affymetrix Inc., CA, USA). The assay uses a solid-phase planar microarray format and was designed to identify dozens of variants of the genes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in patients to help determine their proficiency in drug metabolism.

The ArrayTube is a single tube with an array printed on the bottom of the tube. The ArrayStrips use the same principle but are designed for use in 96-well format, suitable for automation and high throughput (Figure 1)[102]. This system is in the mid-plex range, with a capacity of 400 probes per tube. The UK\u2019s Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Surrey, UK) has launched a commercial product, known as Identibac\u00ae, for the analysis of antimicrobial resistance or virulence in a range of different bacteria [103]. In The Netherlands, the Institute for Food Safety ([RIKILT], Wageningen, The Netherlands) is also developing kits for routine pathogen detection in combination with padlock probe chemistry. Examples of this technology applied to viral diagnostics include the detection and subtyping of avian influenza [25] and the detection of herpesvirus and adenovirus coinfections [26]. Aside from planar arrays, other multiplex technologies are also available. Seegene Inc. (MD, USA; Seoul, Korea) has 16 CE marked products, most of which include viral detection. One such assay is the Seeplex\u00ae RV12 Affinity Capture Elution detection assay, designed to detect 12 major respiratory viruses, 11 respiratory RNA viruses and one DNA virus from patients\u2019 samples, including nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage.

In addition, RNA/DNA extraction could be a real bottleneck when large numbers of samples are processed.

A characteristic of this virus is its genetic and antigenic drift. It is, therefore, important to be able to detect and differentiate the appropriate serotype in the field if possible. For this purpose, a robust quantitative multiplex real-time PCR platform for the simultaneous detection of all the seven serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has been developed. This platform is based on the proven PriProET principle and is targeting the coding region of the 3D gene of the viruses. The authors provided sufficient data to conclude that a complex diagnosis of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak can be accomplished within a short period of time [14].",

The application of padlock probes to the detection of pathogens is a recent development in molecular disease diagnosis. Padlock probes have the capacity to detect many different nucleic acid target sequences in a single multiplex-array platform system. Each viral nucleic acid template is a target for a specific and unique padlock probe [49,50]. The more available specific probes, the more \u2018different\u2019 targets can be detected. The circularized target/probes are then amplified with a single universal primer set. The high-throughput sorting of fluorescently labeled amplicons is then conducted using the tag sequences on a microarray platform. Although the cost for oligonucleotides and array slides is higher than that for conventional PCR assays, it is reduced in proportion to the number of assays in comparison with conventional PCR assay. In this format, multiplex detection using padlock probes and microarrays could have implications in more-effective screening for viruses causing similar vesicular symptoms and, in turn, facilitate rapid counteractions, especially in case of foot-and-mouth outbreaks [49].",

Two real-time PCR methods have been developed and compared: a TaqMan and PriProET assay to improve the detection of the virus. These robust, highly sensitive methods provide valuable diagnostic tools to investigate zoonotic transmission and to detect the virus in the food chain.

The two novel PCR assays detected a broad range of viruses representing all the four genotypes of hepatitis E virus. The TaqMan assay showed higher fluorescence values for positive samples, while the PriProET assay better tolerated the point mutations in the target nucleic acids and, therefore, is a more powerful tool for the detection of new hepatitis E virus variants.

Apart from hybridization and sequencing techniques, PCR and numerous other methods have contributed significantly to this process. The integration of amplification and signal-detection systems, including online real-time devices, have increased speed and sensitivity and greatly facilitated the quantification of target nucleic acids. They have also allowed for sequence characterization using melting or hybridization curves. Rugged portable real-time instruments for field use and robotic devices for processing samples are already available commercially. Various stem-loop DNA probes have been designed to have greater specificity for target recognition during real-time PCR. DNA fingerprinting techniques or postamplification sequencing is used to type pathogenic strains. Characterization according to DNA sequence is becoming more readily available as automated sequencers become more widely used. Reverse hybridization and, to a greater degree, DNA microarrays (as an example of high-throughput systems), are being used for genotyping related organisms, and can allow for the detection of a large variety of different pathogens simultaneously. Nonradioactive labeling of DNA, especially using fluorophores and the principles of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, is now widely used, especially in real-time detection devices.",

In addition to these technological advances, contributions by bioinformatics and the description of unique signatures of DNA sequences from pathogens will contribute to the development of further assays for monitoring presence of pathogens. An important goal will be the continuous development of robust devices capable of sensitively and specifically detecting a broad spectrum of pathogens that will be applicable for point-of-care use. Advances in biosensors, the development of integrated systems, such as lab-on-a-chip devices, and enhanced communications systems, are likely to play significant roles in allowing for rapid therapeutic and management strategies to deal with disease outbreaks.",

The safe tracing, identification and testing of food and feed products is an increasing, very important requirement today, at a global scale. Considering this requirement, research will be conducted aimed at detecting and identifing the various infectious agents, chemicals, hormones and other factors of food safety, in very robust and complex diagnostic systems.
