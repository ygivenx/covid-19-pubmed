ILI can be caused by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and other respiratory viruses [3]. It is considered to be a valid proxy of influenza activity [4], and as many as 30\u201340 % of school-aged children develop ILI during each influenza season [5, 6]. Only about 5 % of children with laboratory-confirmed influenza who seek medical consultation are hospitalised, which signifies that the majority are outpatient cases being cared for in the home [5\u20137]. Children attending childcare centres have a greater risk of acute respiratory infections [8\u201310].",

In Australia, caregivers of children with ILI lost on average 13 hours of work and 3 hours of leisure time per episode [18]. In a large tertiary hospital in Australia, one-third of children who were hospitalised for laboratory-confirmed influenza had at least one other family member develop similar symptoms within one week of the child\u2019s hospitalisation; the child\u2019s illness also resulted in an average of 3.2 days of work absenteeism for parents [19].",

Study researchers visited 90 childcare centres and one paediatric-focused GP practice in Sydney, Australia, and explained the study to the parents of children aged 6 months\u20133 years. Telephone numbers of interested parents were obtained, and researchers phoned them within a week to further explain the study. Interested parents whose children were eligible for the study and who had returned the consent form were then enrolled over the phone. The children were healthy without chronic illness, egg allergy, history of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, or haematological disorders.

PAR-ENT-QoL was developed in French and has been culturally adapted in Italian, German, Portuguese, and Czech [25, 26]. We used the English version of PAR-ENT-QoL provided by the questionnaire developers; however, this version had not yet been validated at the time of our study. The PAR-ENT-QoL questionnaire has 15 items regarding the extent of parents\u2019 worry, stress, mood, quality of sleep, time for family members, outings and leisure, medical expenses, and perceived QoL in general during the preceding 2 weeks. Items were rated using a five-point Likert scale, and ratings were then reversed so that the scoring direction was consistent with the SF-12v2 Acute Form (i.e. a higher score represented better QoL). The items in the PAR-ENT-QoL questionnaire are categorised in two domains (Emotional and Daily Disturbance); the domain scores were calculated by adding up the scores (1\u20135) of items from the corresponding domain. The domain scores were then linearly transformed (ranging from 0 to 100). The Total score was calculated by adding up the two domain scores and dividing by two [26].",

The SF-12v2 Acute Form is similar to the standard SF-12v2, the only difference being that it has a one-week recall period instead of 4 weeks. It covers eight domains: physical functioning (moderate activity, climbing stairs); role physical (accomplished less, limited in activities); bodily pain; general health; vitality (lot of energy); social functioning (interference in social activities); role emotional (accomplished less, less careful); and mental health (felt calm, downhearted). The scores for the first four domains were grouped into a \u201cphysical component summary\u201d, and the scores for the last four domains were grouped into a \u201cmental component summary\u201d [27]. The raw scores obtained were linearly z-score transformed into a 0\u2013100 scale using this formula: [(actual raw score\u2212lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range] \u00d7 100, such that the transformation converts the lowest and highest possible scores to 0 and 100, respectively [27]. A higher score indicated a higher QoL. The SF-12v2 Acute Form domain and summary scores were converted to norm-based scores using software from the Medical Outcomes Trust and QualityMetric Incorporated. This allows direct comparisons with the 1998 general US population, which has a mean score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.",

Another study has shown a decrease in parental QoL if the child\u2019s community-acquired pneumonia was more severe [29]. Demographic factors of the parent and the child with ILI were not associated with QoL.

We know of no published studies on the QoL of caregivers of children with ILI or influenza. Yet, children with influenza are at risk of developing complications such as otitis media and pneumonia [5]. Three studies have shown the negative impact of otitis media and community-acquired pneumonia on parental stress and family functioning [29, 35, 36]. The types of impact and the extent are consistent with what we found in this study and in a qualitative study based on the same sample [25].",

These QoL findings can complement the economic estimation of disease burden, particularly when mothers of young children may not be in the labour force or are only employed part-time [45]. In 2005, only 39 % of Australian women with children under the age of two entered the labour force, of which nearly half worked only 15 h per week [45]. Such employment patterns are similar in the USA [46] and the UK [47]. Also, QoL data collected from parents of children with laboratory-confirmed influenza could inform the government regarding prioritisation of funding for vaccination of particular community groups. Furthermore, parental QoL allows a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden to assist the prioritisation of vaccine development, such as the RSV vaccine that is currently under development [49].",
