Meanwhile, Phasianus colchicus (Ph. c.) represents hybrids of different species (Ph. c. torquatus and Ph. c. mongolicus) in Germany (Glutz von Blotzheim 1994) and is also called ring-necked pheasant because of its white neck feathers. Considerable populations are limited to four federal states in Germany, namely Lower Saxony, North Rhine\u2013Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, and Bavaria. The preferred pheasant habitat is wooded agriculture land with open fields for foraging and display but also with woodland edges and shrubs which provides protective cover (Goldov\u00e1 et al. 2006). Reintroduction of reared wild or farmed pheasants is not as common in Germany as in other countries, like the UK. Therefore, population trends can be used as a realistic indicator for reproductive success and mortality rate.",

            "text": "As a member of the order Galliformes, pheasants may also be infected by pathogens of poultry. Concerning viral infections such as Newcastle Disease, infectious laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis which occur in game birds including pheasants, transmission is described as a result of \u201cdirect or indirect contact with domestic birds or wild bird vectors\u201d (Aldous and Alexander 2008). Like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV) belongs to the group 3 of coronaviruses. Cavanagh (2005) provides an overview about coronaviruses, including IBV and PhCoV, causing alterations in the respiratory tract and kidneys of pheasants (Gough et al. 1996; Lister et al. 1985; Pennycott 2000; Spackman and Cameron 1983; Welchman et al. 2002). Signs varied from sneezing, pale and swollen kidneys, visceral gout and high mortality rates (Gough et al. 1996; Pennycott 2000), over effects on egg production (Spackman and Cameron 1983), to sinusitis, airsacculitis and conjunctivitis, upper and lower respiratory tract diseases without signs of nephritis or effects on egg production (Welchman et al. 2002). Descriptions of coronavirus infections based on farm-raised pheasants. To the best of our knowledge, there are no data available from free-ranging pheasants. Avian influenza viruses are divided into low pathogenic- and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV and HPAIV) due to their pathogenic potential and into different subtypes by the antigenic domains of the haemagglutinin and the neuraminidase receptors. HPAIV have only been described for serotype groups H5 and H7 (Iqbal et al. 2014). Since 2006, avian influenza virus has been detected several times in poultry and free-ranging birds of different species, mostly in Galliformes and Anseriformes. Likewise, Phasianidae are also susceptible. In a study on golden pheasants (Chrysolophus pictus), most animals showed severe morbidity and mortality when artificially infected with HPAIV (van der Goot et al. 2007). After infection with LPAIV pheasants shed virus for up to 45 days and most of the subtypes could be passed to contact pheasants (Humberd et al. 2006). Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) is the causative agent of turkey rhinotracheitis and respiratory infections in other birds belonging to the order Galliformes. Main clinical signs in turkeys are related to the respiratory tract, as well as to the reproductive tract leading to loss in egg production and egg quality. In chickens, aMPV-infection may often be mild or sub-clinical. Because aMPV-infection is often accompanied by other infectious agents of the respiratory tract such as IBV and different bacterial pathogens, it is not possible to identify the importance of this pathogen in respiratory diseases of pheasants yet (Jones 1996). Serological proof of aMPV infections in free-ranging pheasants in Italy showed susceptibility of pheasants to this pathogen (Catelli et al. 2001). In captive pheasants, an infection with avian encephalomyelitis virus has been described (Welchman et al. 2009), but there is no evidence for the occurrence of this pathogen in free-living populations yet. Furthermore, marble spleen disease caused by siadenovirus has already been described as a common disease in pheasants raised on farms but not yet in free-ranging individuals (Fitzgerald et al. 1992; Fitzgerald and Reed 1989; Pennycott 2000). The disease occurs naturally in pheasants 3\u20138 months of age (Swayne 2013). Characteristic pathomorphological lesions are splenomegaly associated with yellow and gray-white spots on the spleen\u2019s surface resulting in the characteristic marble-like look (Orlic et al. 2003), but normal appearance of spleen can also occur (Pennycott 2000; Pennycott 2001). Other typical gross lesions are oedematous congested lungs (Fitzgerald and Reed 1989; Swayne 2013). Data about the occurrence of infectious bursal disease in pheasants are controversial. In China, antibodies against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were detected in 14 out of 40 samples of free-ranging pheasants (Gu et al. 1998). Additionally, in a clinical trial about 20% of pheasants and guinea fowls experimentally infected with IBDV died (Gu et al. 1998). In another study, pheasants experimentally inoculated with serotype 1 viruses failed to induce any clinical signs (Berg et al. 2001; Ingrao et al. 2013). In the recent years, a flavivirus affecting game birds was emerging in central Europe, especially in Spain, the Bagaza virus (BAGV). This virus caused high mortality rates in red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) and ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). In pheasants, BAGV caused neurologic signs and was detected in the brain, while in red-legged partridges it showed pathomorphological changes even in other organs and could be detected in other tissues as well (Gamino et al. 2012). Other flaviviruses have shown how fast conditions can change and new viruses emerge, like the Usutu Virus, which led to high mortality rates in Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula) (Chvala et al. 2007) and the West Nile virus (WNV), whose natural reservoir are birds (Gamino and H\u00f6fle 2013).",

            "text": "Furthermore, diseases induced by different bacterial pathogens are common in captive pheasants. Farm-raised pheasants experimentally infected with Pasteurella multocida causing avian cholera showed a high mortality of 38% within the first 24 h. Typical findings include haemorrhages in the subcutis and subserosa, hepato-splenomegaly with necrotic spots and fibrinonecrotic pneumonia, fibrinopurulent pleuritis and purulent airsacculitis. Pheasants were also found to be highly susceptible (Botzler 1991; Petersen et al. 2001). Pheasants and domestic fowl appear to be very susceptible birds for avian tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (Prukner-Radovcic et al. 1998). Avian tuberculosis, also termed avian mycobacteriosis, is a chronic disease characterized by granuloma formation in various organs (Kul et al. 2005; Moravkova et al. 2011). Different mortality rates have been observed after infections with Salmonella (S.), depending on the age of infected animals and serovar. For example, S. enterica serovar Agona infection of farmed pheasants in Japan, caused mortality rates ranging from 4 to 56% in different years and age groups. Further pathomorphological findings are pericarditis and icteric liver (Myoujin et al. 2003). Several Mycoplasma (M.) species are commonly isolated from healthy pheasants and therefore do not seem to play a role as pathogens (e.g. M. glycophilum, M. pullorum, M. iners) (Bradbury et al. 2001). However, M. gallisepticum has been described as a pathogen of severe respiratory disease associated with high mortality rates in captive pheasants. Therefore, M. gallisepticum plays a significant role as pathogen of respiratory disease in pheasants (Bencina et al. 2003; Pennycott 2001; Welchman 2008; Welchman et al. 2002).",

For example, negative relationship between Heterakis sp. and body condition was detected (Villanua et al. 2006). Furthermore, Heterakis gallinarum can transmit the pathogenic protozoan Histomonas meleagridis, which is the agent causing \u201cblackhead-disease\u201d (Ruff et al. 1970). As an example for indirect influence of parasites, Eucoleus contortus seems to have no impact on the pheasants\u2019 condition, but these birds were preyed by foxes more than expected (Millan et al. 2002).",

Animals in a poor body condition possessed only low amounts of fat reserves frequently associated with pectoral muscle atrophy. In contrast, cachectic animals lacked fat reserves and displayed a serous atrophy of the coronal myocardial fatty tissue. Gender was determined during necropsy by sex dimorphism and gonads. The investigated pheasants consisted of 128 males (49.6%) and 118 females (45.7%), in 12 cases (4.7%) gender could not be determined because of autolysis or lacking parts of carcass. Classification into age groups followed a correlation of different parameters: season, preliminary report, manifestation of sex dimorphism, body size and weight, and histopathological investigation of gonads (geriatric signs, active spermiogenesis, status of ovarian follicles). From hatching to sexual maturity, birds were referred to as juvenile, after this period, they were regarded as adults. Thus, all pheasants were classified into adult (n = 213; 82.6%) or juvenile (n = 36; 14.0%), in nine cases age could not be classified (3.5%).",

Dermatitis of deeper parts of the skin without macroscopically detectable alterations was regularly diagnosed. Both, carcasses and shot birds of all ages and both sexes were affected. The aetiology and the clinical relevance of this dermatitis remain unclear. Due to the different characters and localizations of the inflammatory changes various causes are likely including mechanical impacts (e.g. scratching), ectoparasites as well as primary and secondary bacterial infections. In Rowi (Apteryx rowi), a cutaneous larva migrans of Trichostrongylus species was detected as causal agent of dermatitis (Gartrell et al. 2015). Another possible factor has been described in turkeys that were immunosuppressed by virus infections with subsequent impaired cutaneous antimicrobial barrier and increased susceptibility for opportunistic pathogens, like clostridial infections (Huff et al. 2013; Thachil et al. 2014). A contribution of bacteria towards the inflammatory reaction in the tissues cannot be ruled out so far. Additionally, an allergic reaction or an inflammatory response to toxins has to be considered (Pass 1989). Further investigations on the cause, including pesticides, bacteria, bacterial toxins and immunosuppressive factors, should be performed. At this point, an influence on the pheasant\u2019s well-being cannot be verified, evaluated or excluded.",

In farm-raised pheasants in Slovakia microcysts of Sarcocystis spp. were found in 30% of the samples (Goldov\u00e1 et al. 2006), in Czech Republic shot pheasant originating from one pheasantry were examined and 36.5% revealed muscular sarcocystosis (Cern\u00e1 and Pecka 1984). Sarcosporidia have a two-host lifecycle with herbivores or omnivores as intermediate hosts and carnivores as definitive hosts. In the intermediate hosts, mature cysts are mostly found in striated muscle (Olias et al. 2009). Appearance of clinical signs or morphological changes are not described in many studies (Barrows and Hayes 1977; Box et al. 1984; Dubey et al. 2010). An encephalitis, as recently described in pigeons infected with a hitherto unknown Sarcocystis sp. (Olias et al. 2009; Olias et al. 2013), was not observed in the investigated pheasants. If other inflammations occur or if the parasite is of clinical importance remains undetermined, although not likely.",

            "text": "In the present study, 116 (51.6%) out of 225 pheasants displayed endoparasitic infections (Tab. 4). On pheasant farms, a prevalence of endoparasitic infections of 82.5% in Czech Republic and 48.2% in Slovakia is described (Goldov\u00e1 et al. 2006). A study on the occurrence of endoparasites in Germany from 1999 to 2000 which includes mainly free-ranging pheasants showed an infestation of ecto- and endoparasites in 96.7% of pheasants (Gassal and Schmaschke 2006). Therefore, the results of our study show no excessive prevalence of endoparasites. Most pathogenic species are roundworms (Syngamus trachea, Capillaria spp., Heterakis isolonche, Ascaridia spp.) and coccidia (Eimeria spp.) which are common in wild and reared game birds and may reduce breeding success (cited according to (Goldov\u00e1 et al. 2006)) and were present in the investigated pheasants. According to literature (Backhus 2000; Dowell et al. 1983; Gassal and Schmaschke 2006; Goldov\u00e1 et al. 2006; Hillgarth and Osborne 1991; Hospes 1996) and based on our results (Table 4), an increase in parasite occurrence seems not to be present in the free-ranging pheasant population in Northwestern Germany. However, coccidia, for example, are known to have a more severe effect on small chicks, so the influence on this age group needs to be investigated. Indeed, a parasitic infestation in weakened pheasants may be a supplementary factor for population decline.",

M. pullorum as well as M. glycophilum and M. gallinarum are regularly found in the respiratory tract of domestic pheasants and therefore do not seem to play a role as pathogen of respiratory disease (Bradbury et al. 2001). However, the role of M. gallinaceum and M. iners is still discussed in literature (Welchman et al. 2002). M. gallisepticum in contrast is a known pathogen of severe respiratory disease in pheasants, but was not detected in any of the investigated pheasants in this study. No increased occurrence of certain bacterial species was detected. However, as samples were frozen prior to the performed investigations, the results of the bacteriological examinations may be altered. Nevertheless, a bacterial cause for the population decline seem to be unlikely, but cannot be ruled out. Especially, acting as secondary pathogens bacteria may be a supplementary factor.",

Generally, chances to detect pathogens are usually low. Therefore, it is speculated that this percentage reveals a high prevalence in wild pheasant population. However, sampling was done on carcasses found dead, which represents a preselection per se that raises the chance to detect virus. On the other side, carcasses were frozen prior to examination, which generally is sub-optimal and may decrease the chance to detect certain pathogens. Generally freezing can affect degradation of RNA and therefore reduce the prevalence. However, recent publications (Ji et al. 2017) demonstrate that this effect is more in repeated freezing and thawing cycles. The effect of freezing cannot be fully excluded but as those samples were frozen only for a very limited time this effect is considered to be of minor relevance.",

Nevertheless, the localization of these affected birds all over the sampling area suggests a high distribution of this pathogen. More studies are needed to evaluate the prevalence and distribution of this pathogen, to approve this suspicion. In a verified case, this circumstance involves an influence on population development, because, besides respiratory signs (Welchman et al. 2002) or nephritis (Cavanagh 2005; Cavanagh et al. 2002; Lister et al. 1985), a more important consequence of coronavirus infection in pheasants is a negative influence on survival (Cavanagh et al. 2002; Gough et al. 1996; Pennycott 2000; Pennycott 2001) and egg production (Gough et al. 1996; Spackman and Cameron 1983; Welchman et al. 2002). Mortality rates in captive pheasants range from 15% in breeding pheasants (Gough et al. 1996) to 45% in juvenile pheasants (Lister et al. 1985). According to the coronavirus strain, death may occur with only few clinical signs apart from upper respiratory tract sneezing (Gough et al. 1996). In a wild pheasant population, a similar effect on survival and rearing success may lead to a decline of population, because wild bird populations depend on offspring survival, as described in the UK, where cause for population decline in gray partridges was ascribed to chick mortality (Potts 1986). Serotyping is important to estimate the source of the detected coronavirus and its pathogenicity, to be able to determine subsequently the risk for free-ranging pheasant population (Aldous and Alexander 2008; Cavanagh 2005). Because of high similarity and variability of strains, a differentiation is complicated (Cavanagh 2005). It was not possible to isolate replicating coronaviruses from positive samples in this study (data not shown). Therefore, no further characterization of detected coronaviruses was possible yet.",

Avian metapneumovirus often occurs accompanied by other viruses, such as IBV (Jones 1996), and is discussed as a predisposition for other pathogens (Welchman et al. 2002). Siadenovirus, especially MSDV, is reported to cause also predominantly respiratory clinical signs and often leads to peracute death (Fitzgerald and Reed 1989). Furthermore, immunosuppression may occur in infected pheasants (Fitzgerald et al. 1992). Besides, this disease affects mainly pheasants from 3 to 8 months of age with mortality rates between 5 and 20% (Fitzgerald and Reed 1989). Therefore, a main consequence for influencing population development caused by these pathogens would be high mortality rates in offspring and juvenile pheasants. Moreover, diseased free-ranging pheasants are an easy prey for predators, which may increase the effect on the population. Further investigations should therefore focus on chick mortality.",

To evaluate results and provide a total prevalence, sample numbers should be enhanced and for example, every pheasant shot during hunting season without selection should be investigated. Furthermore, to verify the spread of pathogens over the country, serological investigations of pheasants taken randomly out of the population are needed. Results of this study point towards diseases like coronavirus infection, marble spleen disease and infectious bursitis disease, which affect especially young birds with high mortality rates. Therefore, pheasant chicks should be included in further investigations, too. After all, a general factor decreasing health strength of the population should be considered.",

Furthermore, the weather, parasites and pathogens put stress on free-ranging pheasants. In this study, we present different pathomorphological changes detected in free-ranging pheasants. The combination of different stressors in the environment could explain a possible increased susceptibility towards pathogens, and therefore an important factor in the ongoing population decline (Fairbrother et al. 2004).",
