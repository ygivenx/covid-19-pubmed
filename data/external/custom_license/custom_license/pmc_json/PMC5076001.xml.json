Subsequent to the original isolation of human CSF1 cDNA in the 1980s and demonstration that injection of the recombinant CSF1 protein can expand macrophage populations in mice (24), there were a number of clinical trials of applications in cancer and other indications (23). The interest in CSF1 as a therapeutic agent has been reinvigorated by evidence of the requirement for macrophages in tissue regeneration in multiple organs (7) and the finding that macrophages generated in response to CSF1 have trophic roles (9, 43). CSF1 treatment has been shown to promote regeneration and repair in injury models in the kidney (1), brain (5, 37), and bone (6). The pleiotropic impacts of CSF1 mutations in mice (12) suggest that repair in most tissues is reliant on macrophages that depend on this growth factor.",

            "text": "Applications of CSF1 therapy were constrained by the very short half-life of the 150-amino acid active form of CSF1. We developed a bioactive protein with a longer half-life in the circulation. We fused pig CSF1, which is equally active in all mammalian species tested (20), with the Fc region of pig IgG1a (CSF1-Fc) (21). The expected increase in half-life was confirmed, and CSF1-Fc administration to mice produced substantial increases in circulating monocyte and tissue macrophage numbers, at much lower doses than the native protein. An unexpected effect of the treatment was a substantial increase in the size of the liver, associated with extensive hepatocyte proliferation (21). This observation was consistent with previous data implicating CSF1-dependent macrophages in hepatic regeneration. Acute liver failure in human patients, for example due to paracetamol toxicity, is associated with the loss of clearance functions that protect the body against the contents of the portal blood. Circulating CSF1 levels in human patients upon admission to hospital with paracetamol poisoning were found to be predictive of subsequent prognosis (46). Administration of CSF1-Fc in mouse models produced both accelerated regeneration of the liver and, perhaps more importantly, very rapid restoration of clearance functions (21, 44, 46).",

            "text": "Pigs have been used increasingly as models of human disease (17). The gene expression profiles of stimulated mouse and human macrophages differ greatly, and those of pig macrophages are much more human-like (29). Aside from the possible applications as human disease models, pigs are a major livestock species. Early weaning in pigs, when the mucosal barrier and innate immune systems are immature, is associated with susceptibility to a very wide range of mucosal and systemic bacterial and viral infections that produce significant losses (3). The results obtained in mice cannot necessarily be extrapolated to large animals, including humans, in which the profiles of macrophage activation by both CSF1 and microbial stimuli are very different (29). Our results confirm that, as in the mouse, CSF1-Fc can drive hepatocyte proliferation and modulate the size of the liver in a large animal model. The data support applications of CSF1-Fc in liver regeneration and provide further evidence for the role of CSF1 in monocyte/macrophage maturation. In combination with earlier data, they reinforce the conclusion that circulating CSF1 is a central contributor to the homeostatic control of the size of the liver.",

Based on mouse data (21) we used a dose of 0.75 mg/kg for three daily treatments followed by cull 24 h after final injection. In previous studies, we have compared CSF1-Fc with the native, non-Fc conjugate, form of CSF1 as a control protein. Native CSF1 has a much shorter half-life and at the same dose had no effect on monocyte-macrophage numbers (21). We have not compared CSF1-Fc directly with an irrelevant fusion protein, or with an isotype control for the Fc component. However, an equivalent dose of IgG1 (10\u201320 mg depending on the size of the pig) would have no impact on the plasma IgG concentration (15\u201330 mg/ml). CSF1-Fc treatment of macrophages in vitro did not induce proinflammatory cytokines (21) and, in keeping with the lack of intrinsic proinflammatory activity, there was no evidence of any reaction at the sites of injection in any treated animals. The most obvious effect of CSF1-Fc administration was hepatosplenomegaly. CSF1-Fc doubled the spleen/body weight ratio and increased the liver/body weight ratio by 40% after only 4 days (Fig. 1A). The total WBC count was significantly increased, mainly due to lymphocytosis in addition to the expected monocytosis (Fig. 1B).",

Pig blood monocytes can also be separated into subsets based on expression of surface markers, although the distinctions are not as clear as in other species (16). Expression of various markers by peripheral blood monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry staining (Fig. 2). In addition to the increase in total WBC seen in Fig. 1, the proportion of monocytes, detected by CD172a (SIRPA) was increased around twofold (Fig. 2B). The proportion of cells expressing CD16 was also increased (Fig. 2A). No increase was seen in the percentage of CD3+ lymphocytes (Fig. 2C) The best-characterized monocyte maturation marker in pigs is the haptoglobin receptor, CD163 (16), which has also been implicated as a receptor for the major pig viral pathogen, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) (14), and which varies inversely with CD14 expression. Double staining with the two markers indicated that CSF1-Fc shifted the profiles of both markers, favoring expansion of the CD163+ cells (Fig. 2D). The results are consistent with an impact of CSF1-Fc to promote both monocyte production/release and maturation.",

Figure 3, A and B, demonstrates a substantial increase in large CD14+ monocytes, and even greater increase in CD163+ cells in the marrow of treated animals, consistent with the pattern seen in blood. Aside from monocyte progenitors, a key population of macrophages in bone marrow forms the center of hemopoietic islands. In mice, these cells express sialoadhesin (CD169, which provides a receptor for immature erythrocytes) and are critical for successful engraftment in bone marrow transplantation (10). As shown in Fig. 3C, the CSF1-Fc treatment produced a substantial increase in the CD169+ population in pigs. The CSF1-Fc treatment did not expand the small percentage of cells that express CD117 (KIT), a marker of the stem cell population (Fig. 3D), suggesting that CSF1-Fc acts primarily to promote proliferation/expansion of committed progenitors. In bone marrow of pig, neither CD172a nor CD16 provides a useful marker of monocyte lineage cells, being detected on the large majority of the cells (Fig. 4, A and B) and only marginally increased by CSF1-Fc. We also examined the expression of the CSF1R (CD115) using either a recently described monoclonal antibody (39) or labeled CSF1-Fc. There was some evidence of expansion of the positive cell populations in each case, but the levels of labeling were very low (Fig. 4, C and D). We suggest that the receptor may be downregulated by CSF1-Fc.",

Sections of liver were stained for the proliferative cell marker Ki67. Figure 6 shows images of the liver from two control and two CSF1-Fc-treated pigs. The pigs are relatively young, and still growing, and accordingly there is significant ongoing proliferation evident from Ki67 staining. The vast majority of Ki67+ nuclei in both control and CSF-1-Fc-treated pig livers were large and round, consistent with identity as hepatocytes. Macrophage nuclei are more difficult to visualize in histological sections, because the cells and nuclei are much smaller and ramified in the sinusoids. Very occasional smaller Ki67+ nuclei visible in the sinusoids suggested that some infiltrating monocyte-macrophages were also proliferative, as shown directly in the mouse system (46). The images in Fig. 6 also show an obvious increase in cellularity in response to CSF1-Fc. We counted the total nuclei and the proportion stained with anti-Ki67 in representative large fields from each animal. As shown in Fig. 6, CSF1-Fc treatment almost doubled the total number of nuclei in each field and produced a threefold increase in the percentage of those nuclei stained with anti-Ki67. Essentially the same findings were made with staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (not shown). The sections in Fig. 6 show no evidence of pathology in the liver; notably, there are no pyknotic nuclei and granulocytes are absent. Granulocyte infiltration is the hallmark of tissue injury, including injury to the liver (27).",

The only change was a small increase in bile acids and bilirubin in serum from CSF1-Fc-treated pigs (Fig. 8), only marginally outside the normal range (50). Since standard enzymic indicators of liver injury (alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase) were unchanged, the increase in bile acids probably reflects the increased size of the liver. To examine the impact of CSF1-Fc on liver function in more detail, we profiled the transcriptome. The expression results were filtered to remove genes detected below an arbitrary relative intensity threshold and also genes that did not differ by more than 1.5-fold between the highest and lowest value in the nine samples. The second criterion removed around 30% of probes on the microarray, including many hepatocyte-specific gene products. Figure 9C shows that the relative abundance of representative examples of these known hepatocyte gene products, albumin (ALB), CD14, FETUIN, and transferrin (TF), within the total liver RNA pool was unchanged in response to CSF1-Fc. In other words, the infiltration of the liver by macrophages was insufficient to dilute the contribution of hepatocyte mRNA to the total mRNA pool. That finding is consistent with the histological observation above, that even in the CSF1-Fc-stimulated state the infiltrating macrophages appear to make up no more than 10% of the total area of the liver. Hence, the 40% increase in total liver weight can be attributed primarily to an increase in hepatocytes, consistent with the extensive proliferation and increased cellularity shown in Fig. 6.",

            "text": "We clustered the included probe sets based on expression pattern and displayed them using Biolayout Express3D. The advantage of using the clustering approach is that genes that might appear regulated, but in only a subset of animals, appeared in separate smaller clusters. These may reflect the interanimal variation in macrophage-inducible gene expression that we documented previously in a study of pig breeds (30). The gene lists of specific clusters are provided in Supplemental Table S1. (Supplemental Material for this article is available online at the Journal website.) Functional annotations of the two large clusters were tested using DAVID (Supplemental Table S2). Cluster 1, the set of genes elevated in all CSF1-Fc-treated pigs, was clearly enriched for genes involved in the cell cycle and innate immunity, whereas cluster 2, the set that was reduced in the CSF1-Fc-treated pigs, was enriched in genes involved in metabolism. Importantly, there is no evidence among the induced genes of expression of apoptosis-associated genes, no induction of acute phase genes, and no appearance of classical granulocyte marker genes such as S100A8/S100A9 or MPO. Figure 9 shows the expression profiles of a number of genes that highlight the biological processes involved. Cluster 1 (Fig. 9A) includes many genes that were shown previously (18) to be restricted to macrophages, such as the transcription factor SPI1; surface markers SIRPA, EMR1, and ITGAM; known CSF1-inducible genes PLAU, MMP9, CHI3L1, and C1Q; endocytic receptors MARCO, MSR1, and FCGR1A; and pattern recognition receptors TLR1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. On average, the relative contribution of cluster 1, macrophage-specific genes, to the liver total RNA increased by three- to fivefold in response to CSF1-Fc, again consistent with the histological evidence of increased macrophage content shown in Fig. 5. In mice, the recruited monocytes express the chemokine receptor CCR2 and apparently respond to CCL2 (49). By contrast, CCR1 was enriched in the liver mRNA of treated pigs, alongside three of its known ligands, CCL8, CCL14, and CCL3L1. As previously observed in mice (46), monocytes recruited to the treated livers apparently responded to proinflammatory signals, since cluster 1 contained numerous known LPS-inducible genes (29) such as inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1A, and IL1B; interferon targets IDO1; multiple type 1 interferon targets IRF1, IRF5, IFITM2, and IFIT3; TGFB1; and costimulators of T cell activation CD40, CD80, and CD86. Cluster 1 also contains numerous cell cycle-associated genes, including PCNA; the key transcription factors FOXM1, E2F4, E2F7, and E2F8; and several cyclin genes CCNA2, CCNA3, CCNB2, CCNB3, CCND2, and CCND3. The increased expression of enzymes of glycolysis HK1, HK2, HK3 PFKP, PGK1, PGD, PKM, GPI, GAPDH, and LDHA also reflects the requirement for aerobic glycolysis in proliferating cells (25).",

It includes genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification, notably P450 family (e.g., CYP1A1, CYP2E1), glutathione S-transferases (e.g., GSTAA2) and aldo-ketoreductases (e.g., AKR1C1), and the gluconeogenic enzyme PCK2, that are known to be enriched in perivenous locations. The cluster contains the gene for the regulator of hepatocyte stem cells, SOX9 (2), indicating that these cells are not expanded in the CSF1-Fc-treated livers. Unexpected members of this cluster are genes for the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and the target, IGF1, and both estrogen (ESR1) and androgen (AR) receptors. Also unexpected is the inclusion of the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, MET, which is implicated in regeneration (36), but this might reflect autoregulation in response to its ligand (52).",

Diarrhea and disseminated infections with organisms such as Escherichia coli and Streptococcus suis are relatively common (38). In this respect, the pig has been studied as a model of early-life stress (42).

The number of CD163+ cells was more than tripled in the bone marrow, from \u223c10% to over 30% (Fig. 10B), and increased numbers of CD163+ macrophages were confirmed by immunostaining in liver and spleen (Fig. 10C).

All of the impacts we have observed are consistent with the known biological activity of CSF1. In mice, the same impacts on monocyte-macrophage numbers and maturation can be generated by injection of very much higher doses of native CSF1 (21) or injection of a much larger native form of human CSF1 (24). The doses of native CSF1 required are prohibitive in a large animal. Although we cannot entirely eliminate other functional contributions of the Fc component, the increase in circulating half-life is the most obvious explanation for the increased efficacy compared with native CSF1.",

            "text": "The nature of the so-called hepatostat, which determines that the liver returns to a size that is strictly proportional to body size, has continued to be something of a mystery (34, 35). Although there are many candidates, including growth factors and inhibitors, extracellular matrix proteins and metabolites, and circulating hormones that can regulate hepatic regeneration, it is unclear how any of them functions as a sensor. In a previous study, we made the striking observation that CSF1 treatment of mice (using an Fc conjugate with an increased circulating half-life) was able to increase the size of the liver as well as the number of Kupffer cells. This ability is quite unique. In the present study, we have extended the finding to the domestic pig, an animal that is considerably more human-like in size and vascular biology. The data in Fig. 6 show that a major impact of CSF1-Fc treatment in pigs is to increase the number of hepatocytes through extensive proliferation, so that the total cellularity of the liver is increased even more than the increase in total liver weight. Hepatocyte proliferation, as opposed to hypertrophy, is also a feature of liver regeneration in response to partial hepatectomy (34\u201336). We have made the reciprocal observation in mice; namely, that prolonged depletion of Kupffer cells with anti-CSF1R treatment leads to a reduction in the size of the liver (45). Others have shown that liver regeneration is greatly impaired in CSF1-deficient or anti-CSF1R-treated mice (46) and in mice depleted of blood monocytes (15) and have promoted liver repair by infusing CSF1-stimulated macrophages into the portal vein (47). The impact of CSF1-Fc on hepatic growth in mice was dependent on monocyte recruitment, as evident from the impact of knockout of CCR2 (46). The role of monocyte-macrophage products, including the inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1, and IL6, in hepatocyte proliferation has been well recognized (22, 46). CSF1-Fc action in mice was partly dependent on IL6 (46), which was also induced in all of the CSF1-Fc-treated pigs. The effect of CSF1-Fc treatment demonstrates that CSF1-dependent monocyte recruitment is both necessary and sufficient to drive hepatic proliferation and can drive it beyond the homeostatic limits even in a large animal.",

Macrophages, notably those of the liver (4) and blood monocytes (51), together regulate the level of circulating CSF1 via receptor-mediated endocytosis. This mechanism is evident from the massive increase in circulating CSF1 seen in animals treated with anti-CSF1R (33), and the importance of the liver is evident in patients following partial resection (46). The CSF1-Fc treatment reveals that elevated CSF1 can provoke expansion of the committed monocyte pool in the marrow (Fig. 3), maturation of the monocytes toward a resident phenotype (Fig. 2), and infiltration of the liver (Fig. 5). Hence, the physiological hepatostat (34\u201336) may actually be a \u201cmacrostat.\u201d Of course, the increased macrophage numbers in the liver elicited by CSF1 produce secondary impacts, not only removing potential toxins from the portal blood, but altering the balance of metabolism in the liver between portal and venous-associated functions. Interestingly, resident Kupffer cells are selectively located toward the portal vein in mouse liver lobules (13), which might also serve to localize macrophage-derived hepatocyte proliferative signals.",

The newly recruited monocytes clearly respond to TLR-mediated and other signals to express the large majority of transcripts seen when CSF1-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages respond to LPS (29). However, classical neutrophil chemoattractants such as IL8 were not detected; we found no evidence of neutrophil infiltration, no induction of classical acute phase response or apoptosis genes, and no evidence of damage to liver cells. Furthermore, the pigs showed no adverse impacts, and in weaners the treatment did not impair their rapid growth (Fig. 11). This is consistent with earlier data, in which recombinant CSF1 has previously been administered in Phase 1 clinical trials by continuous infusion to humans and was well-tolerated (11, 28), and indicates that the Fc fusion protein does not produce any additional toxicity. The lack of severe consequences may be attributed in part to induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL10 and TGFB1 in the liver of the treated animals. Whatever the mechanism, the outcome suggests that CSF1-Fc specifically promotes a proregenerative cellular response in liver, as it does in other organs (23).",

            "text": "In the final set of experiments (Fig. 11), we progressed toward the clinical application of CSF1-Fc in a pig model. The model may also reflect a practical application in pig production to bolster the innate immune system at weaning. We showed that only two doses, administered intramuscularly, were sufficient to produce a sustained increase in monocyte count, liver size, and liver macrophage numbers and produced no adverse local reaction. We propose that CSF1-Fc could provide protection against disseminated infections arising from the immature gut of early-weaned animals. Similarly, clearance functions of the macrophages of the liver are crucial to prevent sepsis in acute liver failure in humans, and CSF1-Fc rapidly promoted clearance functions in mouse disease models (46). The fact that administration of CSF1-Fc to pigs increased the size of the liver and the liver macrophage population (i.e., the clearance capacity, noting also the increased expression of clearance receptors in the array profiles) has an obvious relevance to human acute liver failure. Accordingly, we suggest that the fundamental understanding of the central role of CSF1 in liver homeostasis can potentially translate into both human clinical and veterinary applications.",
