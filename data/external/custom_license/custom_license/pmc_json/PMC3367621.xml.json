Assembled genome sequences were compared with those of the first virus isolates of human (TOR2) and animal (SZ3) origin. Any nucleotide (nt) differences were double-checked and confirmed.

Similar SNV patterns were observed in other isolates from patients at the beginning of the 2003 epidemic (13).

However, we lack evidence that eating civet could transmit the virus because the employees had not eaten palm civet before SARS developed.

This situation may be similar to those earliest index cases linked to markets or restaurants that occurred in winter of 2002\u20132003 (18).
