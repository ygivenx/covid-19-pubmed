            "text": "To investigate how cross-reactive antibodies affect live attenuated vaccination, we examined, through an open label and randomized clinical trial, the effects of sequential vaccination with two flaviviral vaccines: the inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine and live attenuated yellow fever (YF) vaccine. These licensed flaviviral vaccines were selected because of their safety profiles and are known to generate cross-reactive antibodies that bind flaviviruses, including dengue, West Nile and zika viruses. A total of 84 healthy volunteers that tested negative for anti-dengue immunoglobulins (IgGs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were randomized, upon receipt of written informed consent, to receive JE followed by YF vaccine or YF vaccine alone (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). To achieve a gradient of cross-reactive antibodies before YF vaccination, we further subdivided the subjects into three groups based on the time interval between JE and YF vaccination: one (Group 1), four (Group 2) and nine months (Group 3) between vaccinations. Group 4 subjects served as controls (only YF vaccine was administered; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). Adverse events (AEs) following JE and YF vaccination did not differ among the different groups (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Other than two subjects from Group 3 with suspected dengue and thus excluded from analysis, the levels of JE antibodies were significantly reduced with increasing amount of time post-completion of the two-dose vaccination schedule, generating a gradient of JE antibodies at the point of YF vaccination (Fig. 1c). Notably, Group 1 subjects had the most differences in JE antibodies when compared with the other groups and provided a broad range of JE antibody titres, covering those observed in Groups 2 and 3. This allowed us to study the effects of cross-reactive JE antibodies on subsequent YF vaccination. Our primary endpoint was the YF neutralizing antibody titres at one month post YF vaccination. Exploratory endpoints included YF vaccine viraemia and the systems biology profile of the host response to vaccination.",

When the YF neutralizing antibody titres one month post YF vaccination were analysed against the JE antibody titre on the day of YF vaccination, an inverted U trend (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1b\u2013d) that fitted a second polynomial function (P = 0.0405) was observed. This trend is similar to in vitro studies that demonstrate ADE of dengue virus infection of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)13,14. YF neutralizing antibody titres were independent of age, body mass index, gender and ethnicity (Supplementary Fig. 1e\u2013h). There was also no correlation between YF and JE antibodies at one month post YF vaccination, suggesting that the higher YF neutralizing antibody response is not due to a boosting of the JE memory response (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 1i). Instead, YF neutralizing antibody titres correlated directly with the magnitude at which pre-YF vaccination sera enhanced YF17D infection in THP-1 monocytic cells, in vitro (Fig. 2c), which is in contrast with the control group where no correlation was observed (Fig. 2d). Collectively, our finding suggests that cross-reactive JE antibodies bind YF vaccine to enhance its infection of APCs.",

Subjects in the treatment group (Groups 1\u20133) were divided into those with or without an enhanced neutralizing antibody response to YF based on whether their neutralizing antibody titre was greater or lower than the upper limit of the 99% confidence interval of the mean titre in the control group, respectively (Fig. 2a). Consistent with previous reports15, increased YF vaccine viraemia was observed in all subjects from day 1 to day 3, and then declined significantly at day 7 in the control group (Fig. 2e). The majority (67.5%) of subjects in the non-enhancing group also displayed reduced viraemia levels from day 3 to day 7 (Fig. 2f). In contrast, the majority (62.5%) of subjects in the enhancing group showed sustained or increased viraemia levels between days 3 and 7 (Fig. 2g). When comparing viraemia levels on day 3 alone, the mean viraemia of the control group subjects was higher than those with prior JE vaccination (Fig. 2h). However, day 3 viraemia levels showed no significant correlation with eventual YF antibody titres (Fig. 2i). The viraemia level on day 7 was highest in the enhancing group (Fig. 2j) and correlated with eventual YF antibody titres (Fig. 2k). Collectively, these results suggest that cross-reactive antibodies improve vaccine immunogenicity by increasing the duration of viraemia.",

First, the global metabolomics investigation, which details the chemical fingerprints left behind by cellular processes, identified >1,100 significantly different features. The enriched metabolic pathways included aminoacyl-RNA-tRNA biosynthesis and linoleic acid, suggesting that increased translation and arachidonic acid synthesis, respectively, act as major contributory factors in enhanced YF immunogenicity (Supplementary Table 6a). Indeed, follow-up targeted analysis identified the pro-inflammatory lipids, specifically arachidonic acid, linoleic acid and the metabolite byproduct, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), to be significantly elevated only in the enhancing group (Fig. 3a,c,e) and positively correlated with YF antibody titres (Fig. 3b,d,f). These findings suggest that YF vaccination in the presence of enhancing levels of cross-reactive antibodies resulted in a greater pro-inflammatory response.",

Consistent with the gene expression findings, serum cytokine measurements identified two cytokines that were significantly correlated with YF neutralizing antibody titres, both of which regulate T cell expansion and activation (Supplementary Table 6b). First, platelet-derived growth factor isoform-BB (PDGF-BB), which affects T cell expansion28, was significantly reduced in the control and non-enhancing groups at day 7 relative to day 0, but not in the enhancing group (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). Second, a reduced level of vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D), which inhibits T cell proliferation and activation29,30, was observed in the enhancing group post-YF vaccination, but not in the control and non-enhancing groups (Supplementary Fig. 4c). VEGF-D levels were also negatively correlated with YF antibody titres (Supplementary Fig. 4d). The cytokine data thus support the gene expression findings.

This antibody binds the conserved fusion loop of flaviviruses, including YF17D virus (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Immune complexes formed between YF17D and h4G2 (Supplementary Fig. 5b) resulted in upregulation of SEMA4A mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and protein levels (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 5d) at 24 h post-infection, but inoculation of h4G2 or YF17D alone did not change SEMA4A expression. Similarly, YF17D opsonized with pre-YF vaccination serum from the enhancing group subjects (Supplementary Fig. 5e) upregulated SEMA4A expression in primary monocytes (Fig. 4f), which was significantly reduced when activating Fc\u03b3Rs were blocked with monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, crosslinking of the activating Fc-receptors alone with anti-Fc\u03b3RI or Fc\u03b3RIIA monoclonal antibodies resulted in significant upregulation of SEMA4A in both THP-1 (Fig. 4h) and primary monocytes (Fig. 4i).

To exclude this possibility, we investigated in vivo the effects of cross-reactive antibodies on YF vaccination in the absence of cross-reactive cellular immunity. C57BL/6 mice were first immunized with inactivated JE vaccine. After day 21, the IgG fraction was purified from mouse sera and transferred to immunologically naive animals. Thereafter, YF vaccine was administered in these mice and the draining lymph nodes (DLNs) were isolated 24 h post-vaccination to assess for migration and activation of DCs (Fig. 5a). The gating strategy to identify DCs is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5i. With increasing concentrations of cross-reactive JE IgG antibodies, the total DCs (Fig. 5b) and activated DCs (Fig. 5c) in the DLNs increased in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with in vitro observations, a low concentration of JE cross-reactive antibodies (1 \u00b5g) resulted in an increased percentage of SEMA4A+ DCs (Fig. 5d,e) with higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for SEMA4A (Fig. 5f). In contrast, no differences in SEMA4A MFI were observed across the total cells in the DLNs, or in mice given pre-immune sera (Supplemntary Fig. 5j\u2013l), suggesting that YF immune complexes induce SEMA4A in DCs (Fig. 5g). Overall, these in vivo results indicate that enhancing levels of cross-reactive antibodies alone increased DC migration and activation, as well as semaphorin upregulation, which contributes to enhanced immunogenicity.",

Low titres of antibody could be suboptimal for activating Fc\u03b3R co-ligation37,38, whereas high titres of cross-reactive antibody could aggregate YF vaccine to instead co-ligate the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB, which reduces the uptake of vaccine by APCs (ref. 39). With ADE, infection led to prolonged viraemia and Fc\u03b3R-dependent signalling that could have, at least in part, resulted in upregulation of inflammatory metabolites. This interpretation is consistent with previous reports showing that immune complexes can upregulate these metabolites, resulting in increased phagocytosis40,41 and improved immune responses42,43. In addition, genes, pathways and cytokines that are known to regulate T cell activation and differentiation were upregulated, although demonstration of an actual improvement in T cell function will need to be shown in a separate study. These observations could potentially explain why individuals with pre-exposure to flavivirus infection demonstrated improved efficacy of the chimaeric YF-dengue virus vaccine compared with immunologically naive individuals9\u201311.",

            "text": "Multiple factors have been proposed to influence vaccine efficacy. These include host genetics, the human microbiome and other environmental influences44\u201346. Our study highlights that vaccine efficacy can be positively influenced by past exposure to heterologous viruses, provided that the cross-reactive antibody titre is optimal for LAV enhancement. It suggests that, if possible, ADE could be exploited to deliver LAVs to overcome a key limitation of vaccination. LAVs, as reported previously, trigger extensive innate immune responses soon after vaccination18,47. Although these responses are needed to stimulate adaptive immune responses against the LAV, they may also rapidly clear the vaccine, thereby limiting the window available for the adaptive immune response to be exposed to the antigen. Indeed, our findings that viraemia levels at day 7, but not day 3, post YF vaccination correlated with eventual YF neutralizing antibody titre indicate that the duration of LAV infection influence immunogenicity. Not surprisingly, therefore, even highly potent LAVs such as those for measles and polio require a booster to sustain the long-term immunity that typically arises following natural wild-type viral infection48,49. The improved immunogenicity of the live attenuated YF vaccine in those with enhancing titres of cross-reactive antibodies thus suggests an approach to overcoming short-lived immunity with vaccination. It could also lead to reducing the need for multiple dosing regimes to achieve adequate neutralizing antibody titres sufficient for protective immunity. Determining the vaccine doses that achieve the antibody\u2013antigen stoichiometry optimal for activating Fc\u03b3R co-ligation to enhance LAV infection and immunogenicity could thus be a pragmatic approach to achieving longer-lasting vaccine efficacy.",
