In this study, we examined rats for clinical and behavioral signs of stress (chromodacryorrhea, hair loss, wounds, inappetence, lethargy, ruffled haircoat and hunched appearance) that could make them unsuitable for research. We also tracked weight, blood glucose concentration, white blood cell (WBC) count and serum corticosterone concentration. Changes to these parameters might indicate distress that is not evident by observation and that could affect research data collected from rats.",

One group of researchers reported that housing post-pubertal Sprague Dawley rats at high densities resulted in decreased muscle mass in males but not in females20. In another study, 56-d-old Sprague Dawley rats that were arbitrarily grouped at high densities (3 rats per cage) showed no significant differences in fighting frequency or weight gain compared with rats that were housed singly; in addition, group-housed rats had lower blood pressure at night3. In several studies of adult rats that were housed at high densities with unfamiliar rats, researchers observed behavioral changes associated with fighting and dominance in males, though not in females17,21,22,23. Studies that evaluated social behaviors related to fighting, dominance and territorial aggression reported that male rats older than 100 d showed territorial aggression and social dominance, whereas juvenile rats only showed play-fighting behavior21,22,23,24,25,26. Another researcher showed that in male Wistar rats, the behavioral and physiological effects of high-density housing were dependent on the developmental stage of the rats27. These reports indicate that both gender and age may affect behavioral and physiological parameters in rats housed at high densities.",

Corticosterone concentrations were also mostly within the published normal ranges, so the increase we observed in HDH F344 rats, which was outside of the normal range, seems to be a true elevation indicating a physiologic stress response.

Another variable that might confound comparison between strains is the difference in group size between the HDH groups of each strain. The difference in the number of rats per cage in each strain was based on the differences in the average body weight of rats in these strains. To make comparisons between the strains, it would be beneficial to standardize the group sizes and available floor space per rat. Furthermore, group size may affect rats' behavior regardless of the amount of floor space available. In larger groups of rats, the social hierarchy is more complex than that in smaller groups, which may lead to increased incidence of aggression or stress responses.

We did note that in F344 rats, corticosterone concentration was higher in HDH rats compared with LDH rats, which may indicate that high-density housing is not optimal for rats of this strain. In addition, gender affected stress in LE rats, whereas in F344 rats it did not. All rats showed normal growth with no clinical signs of severe stress or serious behavioral abnormalities that would result in exclusion from a study.
