The SARS-CoV (SARS-coronavirus) is a single-stranded plus-sense RNA virus, approximately 30 kb in length with genomic sequence not closely resembling any of the previously characterized coronaviruses. The genome of SARS-CoV contains 15 putative open reading frames that encode four structural proteins, including the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein. The S protein is important for viral entry and defines host range and tissue tropism. Moreover, this protein can be divided into S1 and S2 domains, which are involved in cellular receptor interaction and membrane fusion respectively [1]. Amino acid residues 318\u2013510 in the S1 domain was defined as the receptor binding domain (RBD) interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the SARS-CoV functional receptor [2, 3].",

GroEL is an endogenous bacterial chaperone preventing irreversible protein aggregation as well as assisting protein folding into the native conformation [13]. Assistance of protein folding by GroEL is a common phenomenon because approximately 10% of newly synthesized polypeptides in E. coli were the substrates [14]. When the GroEL was removed from S1c by urea, the protein domain formed soluble aggregates.

A possible reason leading to the difference in expression levels of S protein domains in P. pastoris is the codon bias. It has been reported that the expression level of a protein encoded by rare codons can be increased by five-to-ten folds after codon optimization [15, 16]. When the nucleotide sequences encoding S protein domains were submitted to two databases for rare codon analysis, we found that the expression levels are negatively related to the number of rare codons (Table 2). S1c contains the lowest number of rare codons, followed by S2c and S1b. The S2b is the only exceptional case, in which the number of rare codons was similar to that of S1b but the expression level was much lower. However, when we consider only the codons with the lowest frequencies (2.0 or 2.2/1000) in the database of the \u201cRare codons\u2019 Search\u201d, S2b contains two of these codons whereas other fragments contain one or less. This might explain why S2b has such a low expression level in P. pastoris. Taken together, we believe that the expression levels of S protein domains could be improved after codon optimization.\n",

Thus, we can conclude that S1c expressed in P. pastoris appears as a monomer protein. The native size of the smear determined by SEC was much higher than that determined by SDS-PAGE. It might be caused by the extension of carbohydrate side chains, which could further increase the apparent size of a globular protein. When the S1c domain was deglycosylated, it formed soluble aggregates, indicating that the glycosylation is essential to prevent the protein aggregation. The size of de-N-glycosylated S1c was still 5\u201310 kDa higher than the calculated molecular weight. A probable reason is the presence of O-linked mannose residues linking to serine or threonine residues. Another possibility is the incomplete de-N-glycosylation by PNGase F. More N-linked glycans can be removed by using both PNGase F and other N-glycanases such as Endo H and Endo F [17]. To confirm that the protein domains expressed in P. pastoris are functionally active, we have performed the ACE2 pull-down from VeroE6 cell lysate using the glycosylated S1c domain. The results have unambiguously showed that the protein domain has the native fold that can enable its specific binding to the receptor.",

The S1c domain produced in P. pastoris is biologically active because it could selectively pull-down the functional receptor ACE2 from the VeroE6 protein lysate.
