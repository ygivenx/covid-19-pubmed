The Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics (APUA), the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ESCMID) and other authorities have made recommendations, working in partnership with the WHO. In this context, they are acting as stewards on an international level. There are also national and local stewards, such as Stichting Werkgroep Antibioticabeleid (SWAB) in the Netherlands and the Swedish Strategic Programme for the Rational Use of Antimicrobial Agents and Surveillance of Resistance (STRAMA). In the US, the equivalents would be the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the Center for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is a new European Union agency that opened in 2004 to provide stewardship in Europe against infections, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and HIV. In the UK, most clinicians will follow local guidelines or refer to established references, such as the Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS) or the British National Formulary (BNF).",

The result in an unlucky individual (who is infected with a more resistant organism and in whom the peak concentration or the area under the curve is reduced) may be treatment failure as a result of sub-therapeutic antibacterial concentrations at the site of infection. The extent of this problem and its contribution to the global problem of antimicrobial resistance is yet to be established,[6] but we feel it is likely to be highly significant in selecting resistant strains.",

The aim is to stop or narrow the spectrum of the antibacterial used as soon as investigations indicate what appropriate treatment may be. On the whole, the impact of this intervention is not as substantial as it could be because of poor or delayed communication of results. Where there are high prescribing rates of antibacterials in critically ill patients, such as an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), there are combined ward rounds to facilitate appropriate prescribing, with the most up-to-date results that may not yet be available on the computer. The antibacterial committee, comprising a microbiologist, an infectious disease clinician and a pharmacist, generates a list of restricted antibacterials that can only be prescribed after consultation with them. They establish a local protocol of appropriate first-line antibacterials for a given clinical scenario that targets the likely pathogens, with the knowledge of local sensitivity patterns. The antibacterial formulary is reviewed periodically. Another approach often considered is a mandatory review of intravenous antibacterials prescribed after 24\u201348 hours.[15] This is mainly to avoid inappropriately long courses of intravenous therapy but also serves as a prompt to review any positive microbiological results. Once a likely pathogen has been isolated, it is the responsibility of the clinician to rationalise therapy. This is an area where there is room for improvement.",

Common therapeutic uses include treating mastitis in dairy cattle and respiratory illnesses in battery-reared chickens. Non-therapeutic uses include growth promotion in chickens. In agriculture, streptomycin and oxytetracycline are used to spray fruit in orchards to make them more visually appealing. To investigate this situation further, the APUA initiated a 2-year project called Facts about Antimicrobial resistance in Animals (and agriculture) and the Impact on Resistance (FAAIR).[27] It is concerned with the overall effects of antimicrobial use from an ecological point of view. There are two ways they consider that resistant infections can be acquired from the environment; the first is from direct infections from human pathogenic bacteria, such as salmonella from chickens, and the second is from the human acquisition of resistant nonpathogenic bacteria from the environment, which can act as a reservoir of resistance genes that maybe transferred to human pathogenic bacteria. The findings and conclusions are that antimicrobial use selects resistant bacterial strains and genetic vectors specifying resistance genes. The authors see the propagation of antimicrobial resistance as an ecological problem and suggest that reducing it would require an understanding of the commensal microbiota of mammals and genetic vectors of resistance. When one antimicrobial selects out resistance, because of the genetic linkage of resistance genes, other antimicrobial resistances will emerge. The period between the use of an antimicrobial and the emergence of resistance varies, but once the prevalence reaches a certain level, reversal is difficult. The effect of this on the global problem of antimicrobial resistance is unknown. FAAIR\u2019s conclusions are that any antimicrobial used anywhere for anything can affect anyone anywhere in the world. This will cost us financially and our health may be affected, although at a population level the cost of antibacterial resistance is not known. Therefore, the elimination of the nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials in food animals and agriculture will benefit us all. The European Commission banned the use of antibacterials as growth promoters in 1999.",

Food animals may also develop antibacterial-resistant diseases but the scale of the problem has not been ascertained.
