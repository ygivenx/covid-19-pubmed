            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major immune-mediated demyelinating human disease, affecting more than 2.5 million people [1]. It is characterized by varying amounts of demyelination, remyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal injury [1, 2]. In the majority of patients, the disease starts with a relapsing course (relapsing/remitting MS), followed by a progressive phase (secondary progressive MS) years later. In other patients, the relapsing form is missing and the disease is progressive right from the beginning (primary progressive MS). The mechanisms responsible for lesion induction and progression are complex and heterogeneous, and likely reflect different causes and immunopathogenetic mechanisms [3, 4]. A pathohistological comparison revealed that while focal, heavily inflamed, white matter plaques dominate in acute, relapsing MS, a more diffuse inflammatory process that affects the whole central nervous system is associated with massive cortical demyelination and diffuse axonal injury in progressive MS [5]. Based on these findings, Lassmann suggested that progression to progressive MS is associated with the development of a compartmentalized immune response, including intrathecal antibody production trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier [6, 7]. The currently available anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies which successfully reduce the severity and rate of relapses, however, frequently fail to prevent clinical and pathological deterioration of patients with progressive MS [6].",

            "text": "Infection of susceptible mouse strains with low neurovirulent strains of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) results in a chronic progressive inflammatory demyelination of the spinal cord white matter, showing many clinical and pathohistological similarities to chronic progressive MS [8\u201310]. The recent demonstration of early onset axonal pathology in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis led to the conclusion, that Wallerian-type primary axonal pathology due to neuronal death in the acute polioencephalitic phase of the disease induces the first foci of inflammation and myelin breakdown in the spinal cord [11, 12]. Subsequently, a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction develops against the virus [13], which triggers a cascade of events in which pro-inflammatory cytokines released from virus-specific CD4+ T cells cause macrophage-induced bystander demyelination and release of endogenous myelin antigens [14]. Tissue damage and demyelination are exacerbated due to epitope spreading of CD4+ T cells and delayed type hypersensitivity reaction against myelin epitopes [15]. It has been shown that macrophages are of special importance in the pathogenesis of demyelination in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis. They represent the main antigen presenting cells [16], important effector cells of the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction [17\u201319] and the main reservoir for virus persistence [20]. Similarly in many chronic MS cases, remyelination is sparse or absent in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis, despite the presence of intralesional oligodendroglial progenitor cells [10, 21]. In contrast to Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis, a fast and complete remyelination occurs in most other models of MS [22\u201325]. Rodriguez suggested that the balance of de- and remyelination ultimately determines the outcome of an acute attack in MS and, possibly, the development of secondary progressive disease [3]. We recently reported that the failure of remyelination is due to an inhibited differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis [10]. Possible differentiation-inhibiting mechanisms include a non-permissive environment, axonal loss or the inability of chronically demyelinated axons to be remyelinated [26, 27].",

According to the generated k-means clusters (Fig. 4), the majority of the differentially expressed genes displayed an up-regulated transcription in the chronic phase of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis, frequently peaking at 98 dpi. The genes within the obtained six k-means clusters with comparable expression patterns were assigned to functional annotation clustering (Table 1). The k-means cluster I included the 10 genes with the absolute highest fold changes, which were up-regulated from 14 to 196 dpi, with an increase from 14 to 42 dpi and a constantly high expression thereafter (Fig. 4A and B). The genes belonging to cluster I were significantly enriched in gene ontology terms related to the humoural immune response (Table 1). Likewise at 196 dpi, among other antibody domains the constant regions of the heavy chains of IgG2c (IGH-1B) and IgG1 (IGH-4) showed a 398.06- and 87.25-fold up-regulation, respectively. Notably, the Affymetrix probe set 1425385_a_at was originally assigned to IgG2a (IGH-1A) employing the program DAVID. However, certain strains of mice including C57B/ and SJL mice do not express IgG2a, but IgG2c (IGH-1B) [39, 40]. A comparison of the target sequence of the probe set with the murine nucleotide sequences stored in the GenBank employing BLASTN 2.2.19+ revealed a 100% homology of the target sequence with either IgG2c and IgG2a [41]. Thereby it was demonstrated that Affymetrix probe set 1425385_a_at cannot differentiate between the expression of IgG2c and IgG2a. The k-means cluster II included 57 genes which were up-regulated from 14 to 196 dpi. The genes within this cluster demonstrated high fold changes, but in contrast to k-means cluster I, a more pronounced peak at 98 dpi (Fig. 4A and B). The genes belonging to k-means cluster II were significantly enriched in gene ontology terms related to the immune response, defence response, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II and response to other organisms (Table 1). Likewise, at 98 dpi the MHC class II antigens A, \u03b1 (H2-AA) and \u03b21(H2-AB1) showed a 27.54- and 45.24-fold up-regulation, respectively. The k-means cluster III and IV included 141 and 198 genes, respectively. The genes in k-means clusters III and IV were up-regulated from 14 or 42 dpi to 196 dpi, displayed a peak up-regulation at 98 dpi and a high or medium maximal fold change, respectively (Fig. 4A). The k-means cluster V included 334 genes with a mild and progressively increasing up-regulation from 42 to 196 dpi (Fig. 4A). The k-means cluster VI included 261 genes with a progressively decreasing, mild down-regulation towards 196 dpi (Fig. 4A). Despite the large number of genes in k-means clusters V and VI, they were related to only few significantly enriched gene ontology terms (Table 1). Likewise, the only significantly enriched gene ontology term derived for k-means cluster VI was the steroid biosynthetic process, which was a member of a cluster of functionally related gene ontology terms associated with lipid, cholesterol, sterol and steroid biosynthesis and metabolism. Mapping the down-regulated genes on the Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes pathways revealed that the enzymes isopentenyl-diphosphate \u03b3 isomerase (IDI1), farnesyl diphosphate farnesyl transferase 1 (FDFT1), squalene epoxidase (SQLE), cytochrome P450, family 51 (CYP51) and 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), which were down-regulated \u20131.66, \u20131.46, \u20131.36, \u20131.55 and \u20131.55-fold at 196 dpi, respectively, execute multiple sequential steps in cholesterol biosynthesis [42].",

A total of 1137 gene ontology categories in the size range from 2 to 150 genes were included in the analysis. LeFE ranked these categories based on their relative association to the amount of demyelination as measured by MBP-immunohistology (Figs 5E and 6E). The top 20 categories related to demyelination in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis are listed in Table 2 and the top 100 categories inclusive the most important genes of each category are available in Table S3. The three highest scoring categories included sterol metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid biosynthesis, all of which contained 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) among the genes with the highest importance scores. DHCR7 showed a mildly decreasing time course of expression, reaching a \u20131.07, \u20131.12, \u20131.34 and \u20131.32-fold down-regulation at 14, 42, 98 and 196 dpi, respectively (EDGE, q= 0.072). Further genes with high importance scores related to cholesterol biosynthesis were NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL) and farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (FDPS), which also showed a decreasing time course of expression reaching a \u20131.40 and \u20131.38-fold down-regulation, respectively, at 196 dpi (EDGE, q= 0.033; q= 0.163). Additionally, the above mentioned FDFT1 was the gene with the highest importance score for lipid biosynthesis. The categories protein amino acid prenylation, protein prenylation and protein farnesylation are also linked to cholesterol biosynthesis. The genes with the highest importance scores in this group were farnesyltransferase-\u03b1 and the expressed sequence AA409500 related to farnesyltransferase-\u03b2, which are involved in the post-translational prenylation and farnesylation of several proteins, including the small GTP-binding proteins RAB and RAS [43]. Both showed a mild decreasing expression pattern, reaching a \u20131.16 and \u20131.40-fold down-regulation at 196 dpi, respectively (EDGE, q < 0.001, and q= 0.002). In contrast to the above mentioned categories centred on the biosynthesis of cholesterol, the genes with the highest importance scores in the category cholesterol homeostasis showed an increasing expression pattern. These genes were apolipoprotein E (Apo E) and ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G (WHITE), member 1 (ABCG1), reaching a 1.53- and 1.11-fold up-regulation, respectively, at 196 dpi (EDGE q < 0.001, and q= 0.233). Apo E mediates cholesterol homeostasis in the body and is a major lipid carrier in the brain. As such, its expression changes in response to alterations in the cholesterol metabolism [44].",

Furthermore the MBP+ white matter area was assessed, to quantify the amount of demyelination (Fig. 5E). Immunohistochemistry displayed multifocal to coalescing parenchymal inflammatory infiltrates as well as a progressively decreasing MBP immunoreactivity (Fig. 6). The meninges and the perivascular spaces within the demyelinating plaques displayed inflammatory infiltrates, mostly consisting of CD3+ lymphocytes, IgG+ cells, to a lesser extent CD45R/B220+ B lymphocytes and CD107b+ macrophages. The parenchymal infiltrates consisted predominantly of CD107b+ macrophages and to a lesser extent CD3+ T lymphocytes. Many CD107b+ macrophages displayed Gitter-cell morphology. None or only few CD3, CD45R/B220, IgG and CD107b+ cells were noticed in mock-infected animals. Statistical analyses employing Mann-Whitney U-tests revealed a significantly higher amount of CD3, CD45R/B220 and IgG+ cells from 14 to 196 dpi, and CD107b+ cells from 42 to 196 dpi in TMEV-infected compared to mock-infected mice (Fig. 5A\u2013D). The MBP+ area was significantly decreased at 196 dpi in TMEV-infected compared to mock-infected mice (Fig. 5E). The mean amount of each cell type or investigated protein was correlated to the respective gene expression employing Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient, using the data from both groups and all four experimental days (n= 47; Table 3). Notably, the genes coding for the analysed proteins were all contained in the list of the 1001 differentially expressed genes (Table S1).

These results strongly support the recent observation of a robust intrathecal production of IgG antibodies by CD138+ plasma cells in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis [45]. Furthermore, a local antibody production seems to be the best explanation for the higher antibody titres in the CNS compared to serum in about one-third of mice 3 weeks after TMEV infection [46]. The relative higher up-regulation of IgG2c compared to IgG1 in the present study could be an indirect hint towards a Th1-type response [40, 47]. Although detectable in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis in vivo, a contribution of anti-MBP antibodies to demyelination is unlikely [48, 49]. In contrast, a monoclonal antibody raised against TMEV was shown to be myelinotoxic due to cross-reaction with galactocerebroside of the myelin sheaths [50, 51]. Antibodies against galactocerebroside were also detected in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis, in vivo. Notably, the sterotactic injection of anti-galactocerebroside antibodies combined with complement represents a defined model of demyelination on its own [24, 52, 53]. This finding is of special relevance for the use of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis as a model for MS, since the antibody/complement-mediated lesion subtype of MS (pattern II according to Lucchinetti et al.) represents one of the most common ones [4]. Interestingly, a microarray study of secondary progressive MS revealed a robust up-regulation of genes related to antibody synthesis as the major discriminator between lesions and the normal appearing white matter as well as control cases [54]. Another study of MS also revealed an up-regulation of IgG and multiple complement components within the lesions [55]. The demonstrated up-regulation of the Fc receptor for the Fc fragment of IgG (FCGR1) is shared by multiple studies of MS and EAE [56]. The relevance of Fc receptors for chronic demyelination is supported by studies showing a selective up-regulation of the FC receptors for IgG and IgE within chronic MS lesions and a dramatic reversal of the mean clinical score in the chronic phase of EAE in FCGR1\u2013/\u2013 mice compared to controls [55].",

            "text": "In the present study, a group of functionally related genes displaying high fold changes and peaking at 98 dpi was related to antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II, including the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains of MHC class II molecules. Furthermore, multiple molecules and receptors involved in activation of T-helper cells and co-stimulation of B cells including CD28, CD40, CD86 and interleukin-4 receptor \u03b1 (IL-4R) were found to be significantly up-regulated. In Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis macrophages and microglia are thought to represent the main antigen presenting cells [16, 57]. Following TMEV infection in vitro, microglia up-regulate MHC class II expression and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86 and CD40 [57]. MHC class II restricted presentation of virus and myelin epitopes by antigen-presenting cells isolated from the spinal cord of mice with Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis is well documented [58]. The importance of MHC class II expression for virus clearance in the acute phase of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis is shown by the occurrence of a severe polioencephalitis in MHC class II deficient mice [59]. In contrast, MHC class II restricted presentation of myelin epitopes could be a key event in the stimulation of autoreactive B cells. Similar to the present study, up-regulation of MHC class II molecules has been observed in MS and EAE [56]. The up-regulation of antigen processing and presentation via MHC class II molecules, and the humoural immune response within the demyelinated spinal cord in this study is in agreement with the hypothesis formulated by Lassmann that a local immune reaction trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier represents a key pathomechanism in progressive MS [6].",

            "text": "The presented analysis of microarray experiments employing sequential significance analysis, clustering and detection of significantly enriched pathways has the advantage of providing a broad overview of the main transcriptional events at a low and controlled error rate of 1.0% false positives, but it does not directly link the transcriptional changes to the observed pathology. Therefore we used an alternative approach employing a recently developed random forest machine learning algorithm, which directly detects pathways related to demyelination as observed by MBP immunohistology [37, 60]. Accordingly, lipid, sterol and cholesterol biosynthesis, neurite morphogenesis and TLR4-induced immune reactions showed intimate associations to demyelination in this study. The observed down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis is suggested to be directly linked to chronic demyelination, possibly by inhibition of remyelination. The down-regulated genes CYP51, DHCR7, DHCR24, FDFT1, FDPS, IDI1, NSDHL and SQLE are members of the mevalonate pathway downstream of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and represent potent therapeutic targets for cholesterol-lowering agents [61]. Notably, the genes with the highest importance scores for cholesterol biosynthesis identified by LeFE (DHCR7, FDPS, NSDHL) displayed q-values above the 0.01 threshold employed in significance analysis, highlighting the fact that both approaches use independent criteria for pathway selection. Similar to the present study, a microarray analysis of MS cases revealed down-regulations of multiple genes related to lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis and specific myelin proteins, suggesting not only reduced levels of myelin but also a reduced capacity for repair [55]. Another microarray study of progressive MS revealed a down-regulation of DHCR7 not only in the lesions but additionally in the normal appearing white matter, suggesting that the down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis precedes demyelination [54]. At least 70% of myelin dry weight consists of lipids, especially cholesterol [62], and cholesterol availability represents a rate limiting factor for myelination [63]. Mice with a conditional FDFT1 mutation in oligodendrocytes display a robust quantitative impairment of myelination without ultrastructural defects or massive biochemical alterations of the generated myelin [63]. Mice with generally disrupted cholesterol biosynthesis, like DHCR7\u2013/\u2013 mice show severe malformations of the central nervous system and die soon after birth [64]. In accordance with our hypothesis, that the down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis is the primary cause for chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination, this study also showed a progressive down-regulation of MBP mRNA and antigen, as reported previously for Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis [10, 65]. Similar to the present investigation, co-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and MBP transcription is described for mice with a conditional FDFT1 mutation in oligodendrocytes [63]. Although the presented results suggested an association of a down-regulated cholesterol biosynthesis with an increased myelin loss and an unfavourable clinical outcome, other studies revealed opposing results. In MBP-induced active EAE, inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase, which is a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis, resulted in lower clinical scores, diminished demyelination, reduced inflammation and an increased amount of intralesional oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at 13 and 20 days after immunization [66]. The different clinical and pathological outcome despite a down-regulated cholesterol biosynthesis in both studies is most likely the result of the different pathomechanisms and time courses of acute relapsing/remitting EAE compared to chronic progressive Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis [10]. We suggest that the beneficial acute anti-inflammatory effects of a down-regulated cholesterol biosynthesis dominate in EAE [43], thereby preventing an independent evaluation of the long-term effects on remyelination. Notably, while short-time in vitro incubation of rat oligodendroglial progenitor cells and human oligodendrocytes with a HMG-CoA reductase-inhibitor enhances process extension and differentiation, long-time incubation results in process retraction and cell death [67]. While the first beneficial effect seemed to be induced via inhibition of a RhoA GTPase, the detrimental long-term effects are at least partially reversed by cholesterol or isoprenoid treatment. Although the transferability of these in vitro results to the in vivo situation remains to be investigated, further studies in chronic progressive demyelinating models like Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis are suggested to unravel the role of altered oligodendroglial cholesterol biosynthesis on de- and remyelination and for risk assessment of the current treatment trials of cholesterol lowering drugs in MS [43].",

            "text": "The present study showed an association between demyelination and multiple categories centred on an up-regulated TLR4 expression. In the normal human central nervous system TLR4 expression is restricted to microglia, whereas in MS lesions microglia/macrophage as well as astrocytic expression is described [68]. In contrast, TLR4 expression has been observed in meninges, choroid plexus and circumventricular organs in the normal rat brain. However, after LPS stimulation TLR4 was also detected in rat microglial cells [69]. Activation of TLR4 in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis is suggested to be induced through damage-associated molecular patterns (alarmins) such as high mobility group box protein-1 and S100 proteins from necrotic cells and fragmented hyaluronic acid from the extracellular matrix [70\u201372]. Interestingly TLR-4 is known to promote precursor B cell maturation, and could be a potential co-stimulatory signal for the marked up-regulation of the intrathecal humoural immune response already described in the current study [73]. Furthermore, activation of macrophages through TLR4 induces TNF-\u03b1 expression [74]. Notably in this study, two clusters of functionally related genes were found to be involved in processes which activate pathways resulting in the formation of TNF. TNF-\u03b1-signalling represents a well-described pathway leading to a down-regulation of myelin synthesis and oligodendrocyte apoptosis [75\u201377]. TLR4-mediated microglial activation in vitro leads to enhanced oligodendroglial and neuronal toxicity [78]. In contrast, the outcome of TLR4 activation of microglia/macrophages in vivo is more complex and can be rather beneficial [79\u201383]. For example, TLR4-activated microglia induce the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vivo[82]. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of TLR4 in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis.",

Alternatively, a differential expression of genes related to neurite morphogenesis can also result from secondary axonal pathology or disturbances in the cholesterol metabolism [64]. The presented results are in accordance with a microarray study from progressive MS, which revealed many differentially expressed genes operative in neural homeostasis [54]. Another microarray study of MS revealed that neuron-specific genes are generally decreased in the lesions [55]. Interestingly the most important genes in the categories neurite morphogenesis and axonogenesis included the diffusible guidance protein NTNG1, which is involved in the pathogenesis of neural malformations in DHCR7\u2013/\u2013 mice, which display a lacking cholesterol biosynthesis [64]. However, further studies are needed to explain the observed changes and to assess their relationship to early onset (primary) and secondary axonal injury in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis.",

Therefore, the immunohistologically detected IgG+ cells include both plasma cells as well as B cells. Furthermore, positive labelling of other cells bearing surface bound immunoglobulis has to be taken into account and may contribute to the marked difference observed in the numbers of IgG+ cells and CD45R/B220+ B lymphocytes in the present study [84]. Especially the presence of autoreactive anti-galactocerebroside antibodies bound to oligodendrocytes and myelin and immunoglobulins reacting with Fc-receptors on macrophages should be taken into consideration [50, 51].",

The antigen detected by the employed monoclonal rat antimouse CD107b antibody is a lysosome-associated membrane protein also known as LAMP-2 or Mac-3, with an especially high expression in macrophages and granulocytes [85, 86]. Granulocytes can be easily detected based on their nuclear morphology and are not involved in the inflammatory process in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis. We could not detect a significant amount of CD107b+ microglia or other cells within the spinal cord parenchyma of mock-infected control mice. Similarly, no definitive microglial expression was demonstrated in another immunohistological study describing the tissue distribution of Mac-3 [87]. However, Mac-3+ resident microglial cells were non-enzymatically isolated from mouse brains by others [88]. We assume that the CD107b+ cells detected in the present study are most likely blood-borne macrophages, which are known to play a key role in TMEV persistence and demyelination [20, 89].",

Furthermore, we provided evidence that intrathecal antibody production contributes to the pathogenesis of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis. However, the processes with the highest association to demyelination included a down-regulation of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, an up-regulation of innate TLR-4 triggered immune responses and differentially expressed neurite morphogenesis. Based on these findings we suggest that a down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis may be the rate-limiting step inhibiting fast and efficient remyelination in chronic demyelinating conditions like Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis and certain MS cases.",
