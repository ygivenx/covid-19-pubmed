Even in a vaccine trial of an acellular pertussis vaccine in adults with active surveillance of all coughing episodes lasting more than 1 week, only around 5% were caused by B. pertussis [3]. We therefore wondered, which other agents might be responsible for prolonged coughing in nonpertussis cases. We had the opportunity to address this question in a data set originally collected to generate estimates about the population incidence of adult pertussis in Germany [4]. In this dataset, the available biological samples allowed us to extend the diagnostic tests to various pathogens known to be related to acute respiratory infections (ARI) [5].",

For adenovirus DNA, a 131-base pair (bp) fragment of the hexon gene of human adenovirus type 2 was amplified [8]. For influenza A virus RNA, a 101-bp fragment from the M gene was amplified, and the reverse primer was degenerate. For influenza B virus RNA, an 89-nucleotide fragment from the M gene was amplified [9]. For detection of human rhinovirus RNA, a 67-nucleotide fragment from the 5\u2032-UTR region of the genome was amplified. A second primer pair was added to detect an additional 13 subtypes [10]. For human metapneumovirus RNA, a 200-bp fragment from the N gene was used [11]. Primer and probes for rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus were adapted according to sequence alignment. All real-time PCRs with Ct values of >40 were regarded as negative. Samples with Ct values between 36 and 40 were re-analyzed and regarded as positive, when Ct values were reproducible.

The sentinel analyzed here estimated the population-based pertussis incidence at 0.16% per year [4]. Thus, the burden of suffering is known for pertussis, but unclear for most prolonged coughing in adults, affecting about 1.4 and 2.1% of the adult population annually. The condition is cumbersome owing to a median duration of coughing of 6 weeks, and it is a substantial burden to the healthcare system. In about half of the patients, a possible pathogen could be identified by the tests used in this study. However, patients visited their physicians only after coughing for 3 weeks in median, thus limiting the clinical relevance of diagnostic findings for therapeutic interventions. The duration of coughing was equal for smokers and nonsmokers and the proportion of smokers in our sample (26.1%) was similar to the 24.5% reported in the 2013 microcensus [14].",

A retrospective database analysis of drug prescriptions in influenza and influenza-like illnesses of much shorter duration of coughing in Germany [17] showed that in that cohort, around 50% of patients did not receive prescriptions.

M. pneumoniae is mostly associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and less so with ARI and prolonged coughing [5]. Using active surveillance, Szilagyi et al. [18] found that 13% were caused by coronavirus (not studied here), 12% by rhinovirus (2.8% PCR), 7% by RSV (7.6% serology), 4% by influenza virus (4.0% PCR and serology) and metapneumovirus (0.6% PCR), and 1% by adenovirus (15.1% PCR and serology). In their sample, however, only 39% of patients had a healthcare visit. Another US study [19] showed that among adults with febrile or severe ARI, around 40% were positive for any virus, with influenza virus and rhinovirus the leading causes. The importance of rhinovirus was also stressed by a European study pointing to the role of re-infections with another rhinovirus type [20]. Linking a laboratory database with telehealth service data in the UK, Morbey et al. [21] showed that the greatest burden of ARI was associated with influenza and RSV, and that RSV patients most often complained about coughing.",

The sentinels consisted of GPs and internists who worked as GPs. Thus, we systematically missed few patients who primarily attended specialists such as pulmonologists, or ENT specialists. The age distribution differed between HRO and KR, and patients in HRO were younger than those in KR, and we could not identify any cause of this. We used nasopharyngeal swabs for B. pertussis PCR, and pharyngeal washings for viral PCRs. Nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended for pertussis, but pharyngeal washing represents a non-optimal material for viral PCRs [23].",

Diagnostic serology is relevant for pertussis and mycoplasma infections [13, 26], and in 9 patients with IgM antibodies to M. pneumoniae, we assumed a polyclonal response to multiple other antigens. Although viral serology is sometimes regarded as obsolete, we have recently shown that applying latent class analysis for validating diagnostic methods in the absence of a \u201cgold standard,\u201d single-sample viral serology may identify additional cases [27].",
