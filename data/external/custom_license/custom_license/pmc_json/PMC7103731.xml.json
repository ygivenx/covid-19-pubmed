Since the emergence of MERS-CoV, a total of 1800 cases including 640 deaths were reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) [4]. Due to the increased morbidity and mortality of MERS-CoV infection, the attention was directed toward the development of prevention strategies and the establishment of therapeutic modalities. An earlier review was based on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience and had suggested few possible options for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection [5]. In this review, we provide an overview of the progress in the development of therapeutic strategies for MERS.",

The MERS-CoV receptor binding domain (RBD), present on the surface spike protein (S), binds to the host cells receptor DPP IV [46,50,51]. In humans, DPP IV is present mainly on the lower respiratory tract area such as the bronchial epithelial and alveolar cells [52,53]. Although DDP IV is important for the viral entry into host cells, the use of DPP IV inhibitors, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, and saxagliptin, does not block the infection of MERS-CoV [50]. In vitro use of monoclonal antibodies (MERS-4) exhibited IC50 of 0.056 \u00b5g/mL [43]. Other possible human mAb (m336, m337, and m338) neutralize pseudovirus and live virus [45]. In rhesus model of MERS-CoV infection, a human monoclonal antibody, 3B11-N, against MERS-CoV was effective in reducing the pathology of MERS-CoV [47]. The use of polyclonal antibody (pAb) against CD26 inhibits MERS-CoV infection in vitro [50]. Humanized anti-CD26 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) such as MAb YS110 and 2F9 significantly inhibit MERS-COV infection in vitro [38].

            "text": "In the SARS epidemic, convalescent plasma was thought to improve the outcome of SARS patients [5]. Previous studies suggest that convalescent plasma may be used for patients with SARS and severe influenza and may result in decreased viral load and a lower mortality rate [54\u201357]. However, most of the studies were of low or very low quality, lacked control groups, and had risk of bias [58]. Two patients with MERS-CoV infection received intravenous immunoglobulin in an attempt to treat the infection, one patient was in Saudi Arabia [59] and the other was in the USA [60]. A protocol for the use of convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for MERS was suggested [61]. Plasma donors were identified as those with anti-MERS-CoV indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) antibodies (titer of \u22651:160) with no evidence of active MERS-CoV infection [61]. In nine confirmed survivors of MERS-CoV infection, 55%, 33%, and 22% of them had positive MERS antibodies by IFA at 3, 10, and 18 months, respectively [62]. The two patients who had long lasting antibodies had severe disease; however, the titer of the IFA antibodies was not measured in the study [62]. In a larger study, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were produced at low levels and were short-lived [63]. Further studies of the kinetics of the MERS-CoV antibodies showed that all surviving patients and 50% of fatal cases produced IgG and neutralizing antibodies [64]. The presence of antibodies did not lead to the elimination of virus from the lower respiratory tract [64]. In a study of 12 patients from South Korea, nine patients had PRNT50 titers >1:320 by day 21 and two had titers >1:320 by day 28 [65]. In a study of 443 samples, 12 (2.7%) had reactive ELISA results, and 9 of those had reactive indirect fluorescent antibody and microneutralization assay titers [66]. Thus, the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of MERS-CoV in a clinical trial may be challenging due to a small pool of potential donors with sufficient antibody titers [66].",

Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies may offer further therapeutic options for the disease in humans. Since the prospect for a randomized clinical trial is low due to the sporadic nature of the disease outside hospital outbreaks, it is prudent to have well-conducted prospective clinical studies. The proteins involved in MERS-CoV entry and replication are attractive targets for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Clinical studies utilizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies as therapeutic options would add to the prospect to develop therapeutic agents for this syndrome. Although many drugs appear to be effective in vitro, a consideration of their availability, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, and side effects should be taken into consideration. Of medications with an attractive use, lopinavir, interferon, and mycophenolate are among these agents. Accelerated and preferably randomized controlled trails should be conducted. Neutralizing antibodies are also promising and the use of these agents in humans. Targeting the DDP4 receptor may be of particular importance; however, it is important to keep in mind that the development of any mutation in the binding sites may limit the use of these agents [74].
