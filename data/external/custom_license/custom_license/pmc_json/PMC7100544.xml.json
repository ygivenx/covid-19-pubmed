Data for mAbs sponsored in clinical and preclinical study by commercial firms were collected by the survey of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms and from information in the public domain (e.g. press releases and the medical literature). Of all commercial mAbs studied in the clinic, 28 candidates studied primarily for their ability to prevent or treat viral infections were identified (nonspecific immunomodulatory mAbs were excluded). The 28 mAbs entered clinical study between 1985 and 2005, and were composed of either a single mAb or a combination of mAbs (mAb cocktails).",

Antibodies are Y-shaped, having two branches attached to a single stem. The tips of the branches bind to the target, while the stem, also called the crystallizable fragment (Fc), can perform several functions, including the activation of components of the human immune system. Specifically, after binding to a target, antibodies can recruit effector cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells) or activate complement to destroy the target.[3] These two modes of action are referred to as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), respectively, and are mediated through the Fc portion of the molecule. There are five classes of antibodies, the most abundant of which is IgG, and there are four isotypes (IgG1-4) within the IgG class. Human IgG isotypes vary in their ability to induce ADCC and CDC; this is most likely because of their differential affinities for immune system components.[4] Of the four isotypes, IgG1 most effectively induces ADCC and CDC.",

Genetic manipulation now allows genes from multiple sources of B-lymphocytes (e.g. mouse and human) to be combined, resulting in chimeric or humanized mAbs. In addition, a number of methods are currently available for the production of fully human mAbs, including the use of transgenic animals and phage display. mAbs are naturally well suited to intercepting hostile invaders and prompting responses from the immune system. However, mAbs can also simply block entry of an infectious agent into host cells by targeting human cellular components. This mode of action might be desirable against viruses that mutate rapidly and, thus, do not provide stable targets. mAbs can also be designed to pursue their quarry into the interior of cells, though this is a more complicated mode of action compared with the other mechanisms.",
