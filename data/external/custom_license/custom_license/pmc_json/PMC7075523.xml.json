The determined structure, with an Rwork of 0.1700 and an Rfree of 0.2006, contains a single molecule in the crystallographic\nasymmetric unit. Clear electron densities were traced for 176 consecutive\nHKU9-RBD residues, extending from S355 to A520. These amino acids fold\ninto a compact structure, which can be further divided into two subdomains\nas shown schematically in the other RBD structures.35,38,39 The core subdomain comprises eight \u03b2-strands\nand six helices (\u03b1 or 310). Five long strands (\u03b2c1\u2212\u03b2c5)\nare arranged in an antiparallel manner, forming the scaffold center\nof the core (core-center). This core-center sheet is further wrapped\nby the surface helices and loops. It is notable that the six helices\n(H1\u2013H6) are sporadically distributed on the two sheet faces,\nthereby leading to an overall globular fold for the core subdomain.\nOn one lateral side of the core-center sheet, the external subdomain\ncovers the core like a hat, while on the distal opposite side, three\nsmall strands (\u03b2p1\u2212\u03b2p3) constitute a parallel peripheral\nsheet (core-peripheral), ensuring that the N- and C-termini of HKU9-RBD\nare in the proximity. As expected, the characteristic cysteine residues\n(Figure 1B) form three\ndisulfide bonds in the core subdomain, further stabilizing the core\nstructure from the interior. Of these, two (C357\u2013C381 and C411\u2013C517)\nare located in core-peripheral, contributing to the orientation of\nthe RBD termini; one (C399/C452) resides in the core-center, linking\nstrands \u03b2c2 and \u03b2c4 (Figure 3). Overall, the residue\nboundaries of the core subdomain observed in the structure are quite\nconsistent with those deduced from the results of sequence alignment\n(Figure 1B).",

In addition, the residue also contributes a main-chain\nH-bond to the subdomain binding.

In the four RBDs, this residue e invariably forms H-bonds\nwith the core subdomain residue via the main-chain atom but may also\nprovide side-chain H-bond interactions (e.g., in MERS-RBD) or multiple\nvdw contacts (e.g., in SARS-RBD). Extra core\u2013external interactions\nin this region were further observed at position g, where the residue\nis oriented parallel to or toward the core subdomain and thereby contributes\nto the binding via hydrophobic and side-chain H-bond interactions.\nIt is also of interest that these important interface residues of\nelement 2 are regularly interspersed by amino acids at positions c,\nf, and h, which are solvent-exposed and rarely interact with the core\nsubdomain (Figure 5B,C).",

For example, a recent study of the structure of HKU4-RBD35 showed that its N-terminal-most part does not\nfold into a characteristic helix as observed in the structures of\nSARS-RBD38 and MERS-RBD.39 For core-peripheral, the number of strands was found to\nvary from zero (as in HKU4-RBD) to three (as in HKU9-RBD) (Figure 4). This has added\ndramatic complexities to the nomenclature of the RBD secondary elements.\nThe situation would be even worse were the external subdomains that\ncould vary significantly in structure taken into account. We therefore\nsuggest that the core-center strands and helices be designated as\n\u03b2cs (\u03b2c1\u2212\u03b2c5) and Hs (H1, H2, etc.), respectively,\nand that the core-peripheral strands be designated as \u03b2ps (\u03b2p1,\n\u03b2p2, etc.) and the external elements as H\u2032s (H1\u2032,\nH2\u2032, etc.) or \u03b2\u2032s (\u03b21\u2032, \u03b22\u2032,\netc.). This terminological strategy should be able to facilitate the\ncomparison of homologous RBD structures and to reflect the fact that\nthe external subdomain is topologically an insertion between two equivalent\ncore-center strands.",

It would be even more difficult to track the\nevolutionary traces in the viral surface proteins that are normally\nunder great evolutionary pressure. The evolutionary records, however,\nare more likely to be conserved in the tertiary structures than in\nthe amino acid sequences. In betaCoVs, the interlineage sequence identity\nin the S RBD is rather limited. Nevertheless, we observed several\nconserved features in the betaCoV RBD structures. These include (1)\na conserved core-center as the scaffold of the core subdomain, (2)\na similar core-peripheral where the RBD termini are clinched in the\nproximity, (3) a similar topological arrangement of the external subdomain\nas an insertion between two core strands, and (4) a homologous intersubdomain\nbinding mode anchoring the external subdomain to the core subdomain.\nThe features indicate a common ancestor S protein that divergently\nevolves into different species. During evolution, the core subdomain\nis structurally reserved, whereas the external subdomain folds into\nvariant structures to engage different receptors. It is also noteworthy\nthat the aforementioned core features have been structurally validated\nin betaCoV lineages B (SARS-RBD), C (MERS- and HKU4-RBD), and D (HKU9-RBD)\nbut not yet in lineage A.
