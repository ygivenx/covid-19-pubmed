            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a global health problem of unprecedented dimensions. Globally, there were an estimated 33 million people living with HIV (UNAIDS 2008). Cyanovirin-N (CVN), a potent anti-HIV protein shown promising in vivo efficacy recently (Buffa et al. 2009; Tsai et al. 2004), was originally discovered and isolated from the aqueous extract of the cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) Nostoc ellipsosporum (Boyd et al. 1997). CVN can permanently and efficiently inactivate an extensive range of HIV strains as well as prevent cell-to-cell fusion and the transmission of HIV. It acts by binding with high affinity to N-linked high-mannose glycans present on gp120 and gp41 (Dey et al. 2000; Shenoy et al. 2001), thus inhibiting the attachment and fusion of the virus particle to the target cell. In addition, CVN is also active against rhinoviruses, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), hepatitis C, Ebola virus, and influenza A and B viruses (Barrientos et al. 2003; Helle et al. 2006; O'Keefe et al. 2003; Smee et al. 2008). Furthermore, CVN is insensitive to denaturants, detergents, organic solvents, and extreme temperatures. The potent HIV-inactivation ability of CVN and its physicochemical properties make this protein suitable for use as a topical anti-HIV drug.",

            "text": "CVN has a unique sequence of 101 amino acid residues (Boyd et al. 1997). Although the two halves (residues 1\u201350 and 51\u2013101) in the monomeric CVN share a high degree of sequence homology, CVN has an extremely low sequence homology with any other known proteins. It has no homology greater than eight contiguous amino acids or 20% of the total sequence to any other known protein. In addition, it contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds (Bewley et al. 1998; Yang et al. 1999). These properties make the artificial production of this protein very difficult. The expression of recombinant CVN (rCVN) has been attempted in various species including Escherichia coli (Boyd et al. 1997; Colleluori et al. 2005; Mori et al. 1998), Pichia pastoris (Mori et al. 2002), and transgenic Nicotiana tabacum (Sexton et al. 2006), but the efficient expression of biologically functional rCVN is still problematic due to low yield, aggregation, and abnormal modifications. Thus far, E. coli is still considered to be the simplest, most efficient, and least expensive host to produce simple proteins such as rCVN (Liu and Schultz 2006). However, there is a complex reductase system in the cytoplasm of E. coli that renders it difficult to form stable disulfide bonds (Prinz et al. 1997), and these are crucial for the bioactivity of CVN. The periplasm is a more feasible location for the formation of disulfide bonds and protein refolding. But the yield is extremely low (usually less than 10 mg/L) for a heterologous protein produced in the periplasm (Mergulhao et al. 2004). In addition, when expressed in periplasm under the lead of the ompA signal peptide, the final rCVN product was a mixture of intact proteins: Up to 30% of the truncated product was missing the first two N-terminal residues (Mori et al. 1998; Prinz et al. 1997). Alternatively, the expression of CVN as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm increased the yield to 3.5 mg rCVN/g of wet cell. Nevertheless, expression remains problematic as this method produces a significant fraction of dimeric species consistently, as well as generating uncharacterized side-chain modifications (Colleluori et al. 2005).",

Recently, SUMO, fused at the N-terminus with heterologous proteins, has been found to improve protein folding, enhance expression level, and protect the protein from degradation via its properties as a chaperonin. SUMO-fusion proteins can be specifically cleaved by SUMO protease depending on the 3D structure of the SUMO tag at the fusion site, and the target protein will be released, together with its native N terminus (Malakhov et al. 2004). Recently, a series of SUMO expression vectors have been developed for the efficient production of recombinant proteins in prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells (Assadi-Porter et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2008; Sun et al. 2008; Ye et al. 2008).",

To confirm the structural integrity of rCVN expressed from our system, we determined the MW of the purified rCVN using MALDI-TOF MS. It was found that the MW of the rCVN was 11,016.68 Da, in agreement with the theoretical MW for natural CVN (Fig. 4a). There are eight known trypsin cleavage sites in natural CVN, making it possible to confirm the sequence identity of the rCVN product. We determined the peptide profile of rCVN by peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) analysis. The predicted cleavage map of natural CVN is shown in Fig. 4b. From MALDI-TOF/TOF MS spectra of in-gel digested rCVN (Fig. 4c), six peptide fragments with molecular weights comparative to their natural counterpart were identified. Database interpretation also confirmed the identity of the rCVN. Purity is another important characteristic for a recombinant drug candidate. In addition to SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3b), RP-HPLC was also employed to determine the purity of the final product. Figure 4d showed that the elution profile of rCVN in a C18 column is a smooth Gaussian curve without any shoulder peak. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the SUMO expression system we used is able to produce high-quality rCVN.\n\n",

A WST-1 assay revealed that native rCVN possesses significant antiviral activity. For HIV-1/IIIB, the IC50 and CC50 were 22.35 \u00b1 3.74 and 164.31 \u00b1 5.90 nM, respectively (Table 1). At concentrations of 56.25 and 28.13 nM, the inhibition rates of rCVN were 71.2% and 62.8%, respectively. The control, AZT, a well-known anti-HIV compound, exhibited 64.62% inhibition of the virus at a concentration of 62.5 nM (Fig. 5). The IC50 of rCVN for HSV-1 was 28.14 \u00b1 2.72 nM, and the CC50 was 190.63 \u00b1 9.07 nM (Table 1). The above results indicate that purified rCVN is functionally active. In addition, SUMO-CVN also exhibited activity against HSV-1 with an IC50 of 31.37 \u00b1 2.15 nM, comparable to that of native rCVN. This result serves as evidence that SUMO-CVN is produced in the cytoplasm as the fully folded and biologically functional form, providing an alternative source of the protein for practical applications.\n\n\n",

However, the sequence properties of CVN make it difficult to be produced in heterologous hosts. The expression of rCVN in transgenic plants is time-consuming, with low yields, undeveloped downstream processes, and potential posttranslational modifications (Sexton et al. 2006). Another choice is to produce rCVN in a different eukaryotic system, P. pastoris. However, it seems difficult to obtain native rCVN using this system because of high-mannose N-glycosylation at position N30 and the dimerization of the final product mediated by P51 in the hinge region, both of which result in a loss of antiviral activity of rCVN (Mori et al. 2002). Although E. coli is so far the best-studied host, considerable problems still exist in its practical use for the expression of rCVN. Low protein yield remains a major issue. In addition, rCVN as expressed in E. coli tends to aggregate into nonfunctional forms, which have been attributed to the lack of stable disulfide bond formation and proper folding.",

SUMO is a common protein in eukaryotic cells, and it regulates the activities and cellular localizations of target proteins through a modification process similar to ubiquitination (Butt et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2002). Several proteins that are difficult to express in conventional systems, such as SARS-CoV structure proteins (Zuo et al. 2005), metalloprotease (MMP13) (Marblestone et al. 2006), brazzein (Assadi-Porter et al. 2008), urodilatin (Sun et al. 2008), and antibody fragment (Ye et al. 2008) have been successfully expressed in E. coli using a SUMO fusion strategy. Our data showed that a SUMO-CVN fusion construct was efficiently expressed in a soluble form in the cytoplasm of E. coli, supporting the idea that SUMO facilitates the soluble expression of foreign (heterologous) proteins in E. coli. As SUMO is a fusion label, the mechanism of the yield enhancement and solubility improvement is still unclear. Several studies implicate that it may function as a chaperonin or act as a core for the folding of recombinant proteins in E. coli (Butt et al. 2005).",

Ni2+ affinity chromatography has also been applied to rapidly purify rCVN produced in P. pastoris (Mori et al. 2002), but the final product is His-tagged rather than native rCVN. It is possible to release native rCVN from SUMO-CVN by cleaving with SUMO protease at the site of the fusion. An advantage of our system is that a hexahistidine tag was fused at the N-terminal of SUMO so that the SUMO-CVN could be rapidly purified from the total protein extraction by simply running it through a Ni-NTA column. After digestion with SUMO protease, the released native rCVN could be subsequently purified using the same column to over 97% purity. With this purification process, we obtained a final yield of about 3\u20134 mg/g of wet cells. The amount is considerable as the protein was induced in E. coli in a conventional flask-shaking culture. E. coli has been cultured to densities greater than 150 g DCW/L in optimized conditions (Lee 1996; Xia et al. 2008). In an ordinary fermentor culture, the biomass will be over 50 g WCW/L, a level that is usually reached in our laboratory (Xiong et al. 2007). The yield of rCVN from our SUMO-CVN system in a fermentor fed-batch culture is therefore expected to be over 150 mg/L. Efforts are now being made to further improve the protein yield of native rCVN using our system.",

Other problems reported for rCVN expression in E. coli include N-terminal deletion, dimerization, and side-chain modification. MW determination, PMF analysis, RP-HPLC chromatography, and SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the purified rCVN derived from our system was intact, homogeneous, and monomeric. Another advantage of this system is that the intermediate recombinant product, SUMO-CVN, was also biologically functional and had an antiviral activity against HSV that was comparable to native rCVN.
