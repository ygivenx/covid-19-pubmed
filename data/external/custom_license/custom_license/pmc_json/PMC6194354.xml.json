Outbreaks and sporadic cases have indicated that food vehicles such as poultry and poultry by-products are among the most common sources of Salmonella infections (Revolledo et al., 2009). In chickens, Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) and Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) are major food-borne Salmonella serovars which can colonize or invade the gastrointestinal tract and thus contaminate meat and eggs and cause food poisoning (He et al., 2012). With the restrictions on the use of antibiotics, alternative approaches such as dietary interventions are being evaluated to improve animal health and control Salmonella infection. Notable among the interventions is the use of plant extracts in animal feed as they are considered to be \u201cnatural\u201d additives and have been shown to be effective immune modulators in response to pathogen infections (Pugh et al., 2005).",

Stimulated macrophages are not only phagocytic cells which detect, phagocytize, and eliminate infectious agents but also serve as antigen-presenting cells for B and T lymphocytes and participate in the stimulation of the adaptive immune system (Setta et al., 2012). However, as a facultative intracellular pathogen, Salmonella is able to produce effector proteins which manipulate macrophages to delay the phagolysosomal maturation and thus avoid exposure to lysosomal contents (Haraga et al., 2008). The ability of Salmonella to survive and multiply within chicken macrophages is crucial for Salmonella virulence and pathogenesis (Barrow et al., 1994). To control intracellular Salmonella, macrophages are activated to produce several antimicrobial substances such as nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and secrete a group of cytokines and chemokines such as interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) (Ibuki et al., 2011). Previous studies demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways are involved in macrophage activation and play a critical role in pro-inflammatory effector production and autophagy formation (Mosser and Edwards, 2008; He et al., 2012). These have been shown to be important in controlling intracellular pathogens.",

            "text": "The roots and rhizomes of the Glycyrrhiza species (licorice) have been widely used as natural sweeteners and herbal medicines. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a major biologically active constituent of licorice root, consists of one molecule of 18-glycyrrhetinic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid (Matsui et al., 2004). So far, GA has been reported to have anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activity (Honda et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2017). Previous studies indicated that GA may act as a potent anti-infectious agent in the process of pathogen invasion by targeting particular immune cells like macrophages and dendritic cells (Bhattacharjee et al., 2012; Hua et al., 2012). In a mouse model, GA treatment caused an enhanced production of NO along with inhibition of intracellular survival of Leishmania donovani in macrophages and decreased hepatic and splenic parasite burden in vivo (Bhattacharjee et al., 2012). GA could also increase the productions of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b2 in macrophages and exhibits a curative effect on several virus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) (Dai et al., 2001; Cinatl et al., 2003; Michaelis et al., 2010). However, most of these studies are focused on mammals, and there is no report on the effect of GA on immune function in chickens. In the present study, we investigated the effects of GA on phagocytic and bacteria-killing activity against ST of the chicken macrophage. Additionally, the expression of cell surface molecules and antimicrobial genes, production of antimicrobial effectors, and its possible mechanisms were analyzed.",

CD83 is essentially expressed on the surface of mature dendritic cells and participates in the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes (Tang et al., 2005; Rimaniol et al., 2007). This induction of CD83 as well as costimulatory molecules (e.g. CD80) on macrophages suggested that GA could enhance the ability of macrophages to favor T lymphocyte activation. These results not only confirm that GA activates an innate immune response in chicken macrophages to eliminate intracellular ST, but also suggest that GA may contribute to the activation of adaptive immune response in vivo.",

It produces superoxide from oxygen and subsequently leads to the generation of other toxic reactive oxygen intermediates, such as H2O2 (Rosenberger and Finlay, 2002). Previous reports have shown that both iNOS and NOX activity impaired Salmonella replication (Rosenberger and Finlay, 2002), and mice deficient in iNOS and NOX were unable to control ST infection (Mastroeni et al., 2000). In the present study, GA could significantly up-regulate iNOS and NOX-1 mRNA expression and thereby markedly induced the productions of NO and H2O2, which led to a marked reduction of ST viability in macrophages. Similar results were obtained from an in vitro study, in which \u03b2 1-4 mannobiose enhanced the productions of NO and H2O2, and resulted in decreased intracellular survival of SE in chicken MQ-NCSU cells (Ibuki et al., 2011).",

            "text": "It is known that macrophage activation requires stimulation of specific transcription factors, among which MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK) and NF-\u03baB are well characterized in both mammalian and avian cells in response to pathogen infection (He and Kogut, 2003; Han et al., 2009). MAPKs regulate the expression of various inflammatory cytokines (He and Kogut, 2003). NF-\u03baB proteins are detached from its inhibitor inhibitory \u03baB (I\u03baB) after activation, and finally translocate to the nucleus and manipulate the transcription of an array of antimicrobial genes such as iNOS (Han et al., 2009). We found that NF-\u03baB and JNK pathway inhibition potently down-regulated the GA-induced NO production and IFN-\u03b3 expression in stimulated cells, while suppression of ERK1/2 up-regulated NO and IFN-\u03b3 levels. These results were supported by previous observations, in which NF-\u03baB and JNK inhibitor successfully reduced NO and IFN-\u03b3 secretion while ERK1/2 inhibitor markedly increased NO production in murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Mao et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017). These findings indicated that NF-\u03baB and JNK activation are required for GA-activated chicken macrophages, whereas ERK1/2 signaling may exhibit a regulatory effect to limit excessive inflammation.",
