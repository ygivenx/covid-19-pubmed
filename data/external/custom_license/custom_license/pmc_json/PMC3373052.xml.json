We ordered all healthcare facilities to immediately report all new patients with clinical sepsis, meningitis, arthritis, or endocarditis and fever >37.3\u00b0C, who had epidemiologic risk factors (contact with sick pigs or any part, such as meat, skin, organs, or tissue, of pigs that had died of undetermined causes). Beginning on July 21, we made public announcements to encourage reporting. Public health workers interviewed patients, or surrogates for deceased patients, by using a questionnaire to collect demographic, clinical, and exposure information. Specimens (blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], or postmortem tissue) were collected for laboratory investigation. We reviewed medical records to obtain supplementary clinical information. We placed all close contacts of case-patients, including family members and attending healthcare workers, under medical surveillance. We extended these surveillance procedures to all of Sichuan Province on July 25.",

From late July to early August 1998, an outbreak of 25 cases with 14 deaths occurred in Jiangsu Province, China, from serotype 2 infection (15). The size of the outbreak in our study was probably related to a local farming practice. In Sichuan, a sizable swine population was found in small backyard farms; each family kept only a few animals. Farmers habitually slaughtered sick pigs for human consumption. Beginning mid-June 2005, a major outbreak of S. suis killed 647 pigs in almost the same areas as the outbreak in humans (16). The outbreak in swine peaked around July 20 with \u22484 dead pigs in each affected village. S. suis caused 98% of the deaths of these pigs in Sichuan during this period (17). All infected pigs came from backyard farms, usually with 1 sick pig in the herd. A pathogenic strain could have spread by distributing infected piglets to the backyard pig farms and then propagated among healthy pigs. The single ribotype identified in the investigation lends support to this theory.",

Normally 1\u20132 persons carried out the procedure, which involved bloodletting though a neck artery, manually inflating the carcasses, scalding the pigskin with \u224880\u00b0C water, and splitting and shaving the skin with large knives. Scalding and shaving were often performed together. The farmers then sliced the meat into smaller pieces before cooking for food. The complete process of slaughtering could take >1 hour. Our study demonstrated that all patients had been infected during direct contact with blood or tissues of sick or dead pigs. Often this may have occurred through direct exposure of skin wounds. Droplet exposure may also have occurred during slaughter or processing of carcasses, but we could not document this occurrence. The observed risk factors were consistent with those reported in other studies (5,6). No evidence of infection from eating cooked pork from these pigs was observed. The uncooked meat was shared with neighboring families, but these villagers normally do not eat raw meat or raw animal viscera. Person-to-person transmission was highly unlikely since we found no disease in family members, neighbors, or healthcare workers who had not been exposed to sick or dead pigs.",

Human S. suis infection after exposure to sick goats has not been reported, despite isolation of the organism from these animals (2). In backyard farms where different animals are kept together, S. suis infection could have been transmitted between pigs and goats.

Prompt institution of effective responses to human S. suis outbreaks is a public health challenge, especially in rural China. Timely diagnosis is difficult. In our study, only 31% of the cases were laboratory confirmed. Suboptimal access to health services, personal delay in seeking treatment, underutilization of blood cultures in local hospitals, and self-administration of antimicrobial drugs may explain the relatively low proportion of culture-positive human cases, especially during the early phase of the outbreak. Many patients died without having sought treatment from any health facility. As for the investigation process, the existing surveillance system that covers meningitis is not robust enough to alert public health personnel of the impending threat of S. suis. Control measures included prohibiting by law of slaughtering, eating, selling, and transporting deceased or sick pigs. Subsidies were offered to families to support hygienic handling of deceased or sick pigs and to patients for medical care. Village heads were held accountable for illegal slaughtering in their village. These measures were supplemented with disinfection of affected backyard farms. Public education campaigns were staged to increase awareness of how to prevent and control human S. suis infections. In the long run, the prevention and control of swine infection should form the more strategic component of the public health program. Surveillance systems should be established to alert farmers and the general public if an infection outbreak in pigs is recognized (19).",
