Presently, PPV is recognized as one of the most serious viral infections of swine worldwide, causing heavy economic losses to the pig industry [21, 22]. PPV has a single-stranded DNA genome encapsidated by a nonenveloped icosahedral particle of 25 nm in diameter that is composed of three structural proteins: VP1, VP2 and VP3, of which VP2 is the major component [27]. In the past decades, knowledge in molecular biology, antigenicity, and virulence of the virus has rapidly grown, but little is known about the pathogenicity of PPV infection.",

It has been shown to have antimicrobial activity for several bacteria and protozoa and for some viruses [1, 7, 15, 17, 23, 25]. It also has been demonstrated that NO hinders the productive infection of several animal virus, including vaccinia virus (VV) [4], influenza virus [29], Japanese encephalitis virus [17, 26, 31], Marek\u2019s disease virus [31], and murine Friend leukemia retrovirus [2]. NO exerts its inhibitory effect on viral infection by interfering with specific stages in the cycle of viral replication. For example, NO inhibits viral DNA synthesis, late protein translation, and virion assembly, resulting in lower viral yields and more efficient host clearance of the infection [8, 10, 13, 14, 18]. In this study, the inhibitory effect of NO on PPV replication and the effect of NO on different stages of the PPV replication cycle were investigated in vitro.",

This finding is consistent with previous reports in which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were studied [5, 25]. Although this reduction in viral replication is seen with NO itself, it is not certain whether the antiviral effects of SNAP or LA are actually due to some other NO-related species. To address this question, three lines of evidence from our experiments indicate that the inhibition of PPV replication in PK-15 cells is most likely caused by NO and not by other factors. Firstly, SNAP and LA could induce the release of NO and inhibit PPV replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1b). Secondly, the addition of l-NAME, a NOS inhibitor, could reduce NO production in stimulated cultures, and consequently, the inhibition of PPV replication was reversed (Fig. 1a). Finally, the result of the MTT assay clearly excluded the possibility that the antiviral effect of SNAP or LA was due to the general cytotoxicity of SNAP or LA itself (Fig. 1c). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that NO, generated from SNAP or LA, could inhibit the replication of PPV in PK-15 cells.",

These results were similar to those of a previously study by Rimmelzwaan et al. [24], which showed that addition of NO donor 3 h prior to infection significantly reduced the synthesis of both vRNA and mRNA. In contrast, some papers have indicated that pretreatment of N18 and SW480 cells with SNAP did not enhance anti-JEV and anti-Sindbis virus inhibition, respectively [8, 16]. These differences in antiviral responses were probably due to the different natures of the viruses and cell lines in the experiments.

For example, NO inhibits enzymes implicated in diverse metabolic processes, such as glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [20], cis-aconitase [30] and NADPH-ubiquinone reductase [28], reducing the production of ATP. Our results demonstrate that NO specially inhibits the PPV replication cycle during the step of viral protein synthesis (Fig. 3b). The rates of inhibition by SNAP and LA on viral protein synthesis were high\u2014up to 80%\u2014when these compounds were added 6 h prior to infection, whereas the inhibition rates of SNAP and LA on viral DNA synthesis were about 60%, showing that the inhibitory effect on DNA replication was less than that on the viral protein synthesis. The reason for this discrepancy is uncertain but may reflect an inhibition by NO of one or more steps of the PPV life cycle. These results are consistent with a previous report by Lin et al., who showed that NO is able to reduce the amount of viral glycoprotein and packaged virion RNA secreted from JEV-infected cells into the medium, implying that NO may interfere with the release and/or maturation of virions [16]. However, since our data are unable to furnish us with information on how NO inhibits PPV at the molecular level, more studies are required to elucidate the potential viral and cellular targets of NO.",
