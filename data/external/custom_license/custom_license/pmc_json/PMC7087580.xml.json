For this reason, the levels of key antioxidant enzymes [e.g., CAT and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], total antioxidant status (TAS), and MDA (the product of lipid peroxidation representing ROS-mediated tissue peroxidation injury) were evaluated in lung tissue on days 2 and 4 post-infection. Influenza infection induced a significant increase of MDA and a decrease in CAT and SOD activity in virus control mice while the administration of rhCAT resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of MDA and a higher activity of CAT and SOD (Fig. 2; p \u2264 0.05). rhCAT treatment slightly influenced the level of TAS but revealed no significant difference between virus control and rhCAT-treated mice (Fig. 2b). The antioxidant system is comprised of non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules (e.g., vitamins A, C, and E, glutathione, etc.) and antioxidant enzymes (e.g., CAT, SOD and various peroxidases) and is therefore reflected in TAS measurements. This therefore indicates that rhCAT may partly restore the antioxidant enzyme system while at the same time not significantly influencing TAS levels. Thus. rhCAT administration reduced ROS-mediated injury, which might be relevant in alleviating the effects of viral pneumonia, thereby reducing mortality.\n",

IL-6 expression is directly linked to host morbidity [27, 28], and TNF-\u03b1 secretion enhances pulmonary injury.
