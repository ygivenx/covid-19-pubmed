Different types of specimen are available for viral diagnosis. The nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) has been considered to be the best sampling technique, but is more invasive and results in significantly more distress of the infant than a nasal swab (NS) [5]. A number of studies have compared the sensitivity of the NPA with nasopharyngeal swabs [6], nose\u2013throat swabs [7] and NS [5, 8\u201310]. Generally, conventional techniques such as viral culture and antigen detection methods were used. The use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may overcome differences in sensitivity for respiratory viruses as a result of specimen type [7].",

Parents were instructed to notify the clinical staff within 24 h after the onset of symptoms. Clinical staff visited the child within 36 h and the history of illness was taken by a standardised questionnaire. Symptoms were scored, according to Gern et al.

Nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp DSP virus kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Each sample was eluted in 200 \u03bcl buffer. cDNA was synthesised by using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (RT) and random hexamers (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) [14]. Each 100-\u03bcl reaction mixture contained 60 \u03bcl cDNA mix and 40 \u03bcl of eluted RNA. After incubation for 10 min at 25\u00b0C, RT was carried out for 30 min at 48\u00b0C, followed by RT inactivation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C [14]. Samples were assayed in a 50-\u03bcl reaction mixture containing 20 \u03bcl (c)DNA and a 30-\u03bcl mix of the forward and reverse primers and probes. All samples had been spiked before extraction with an internal control virus (murine encephalomyocarditis virus [RNA] and phocine herpes virus [DNA]). The amplification and detection were performed by the use of an ABI Prism 7700 sequence-detection system; 2 min at 50\u00b0C to acquire optimal AmpErase UNG activity and 10 min at 95\u00b0C to activate AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C [15]. Primers and probes for the real-time PCR detection of RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus are available from van de Pol et al.

The most frequently detected virus was RSV, followed by human bocavirus and rhinovirus [21, 23]. A common combination has been reported to be RSV and bocavirus [21]. Even though a high occurrence of co-infections has been reported, ranging from 14\u201316% [21, 22] to 27% [20], our study presents an even higher rate of co-infection. A possible explanation for this high co-infection rate may be related to the sampling of both nostrils for the NPA. Human bocavirus is a newly identified virus and has been detected in respiratory tract secretions in patients with acute respiratory symptoms in 2 to 19% of the samples [24]. Co-infection with another virus has been observed in 40% of bocavirus-positive children [25]. The frequent associations of bocavirus with other respiratory viruses might be explained by the persistence of bocavirus in the respiratory tract [25].",

For both RSV and rhinovirus, viral load, indicated by the CT value, was the major determinant of the sensitivity of the NS in a dose-dependent fashion.

The major advantage of a swab is that collection is less painful and more convenient than an aspirate, as no additional devices are needed [5]. These factors may outweigh some reduction in sensitivity. The advantage of molecular methods in the detection of respiratory viruses has been reported [26, 27] and Lambert et al. reported that using these methods seemed to overcome the previously observed sensitivity reduction when less invasive specimens were combined with the conventional laboratory methods [7]. With the recently developed flocked swabs, the sensitivity is even further improved and the flocked swabs have the advantage of being rapid and less traumatic for paediatric patients [28]. However, the sensitivity of the flocked swab in outpatient respiratory tract infections may be lower than in hospitalised patients. Further studies are required considering different types of swabs and patient populations, and should test for a broad spectrum of respiratory pathogens.",

Lambert et al. did not test for rhinovirus and this was the most frequently detected virus in our study and elsewhere [11, 29]. No influenza detections were found in our study. This is not explained by sampling bias, because most swabs were taken during the winter season, during which both RSV and influenza had their peak incidence. A possible reason may be related to the patient population and the small population size. Another study showed similar results, with rhinovirus and RSV being the most frequently detected [29].",

Since the viral shedding of RSV is highest between days 0 and 6, sampling should preferably occur in this period [30]. The high proportion of positive samples, however, indicates that this effect was not a major drawback of this study. Secondly, in this study, pain and discomfort of the collection of the samples was not assessed, but other studies provided reference to this [5]. Finally, it is unknown whether the order of obtaining the specimens may have resulted in a lower detection rate in the NS. It is possible that, by suctioning both nostrils for the NPA, the secretions with virus or viral nucleic acids were reduced. This corresponds with the finding that few mild cases were detected with the NS, as the sensitivity of the NS dropped with lower symptoms score and higher CT values. Because the order and nature of the sample collection was slightly different from the study performed by Lambert et al., the sensitivity of the NS may be an underestimate, and caution needs to be taken when interpreting the NS sensitivity.",

The great advantage of the NS is that this method can be performed in outpatient settings without needing special devices, is less costly and causes less distress for the patient than the NPA.
