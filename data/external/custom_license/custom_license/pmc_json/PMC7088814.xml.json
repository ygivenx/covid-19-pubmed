In the U.S., there are about 2.5 to 3.3 million episodes per year [3], with more than 200,000 hospitalizations [4]. Among immunocompetent children, CAP may be caused by a wide variety of microbes, including many viruses, \u201ctypical\u201d bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae), atypical bacteria (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae), Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related species, and fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum [5\u201310, 11\u2022\u2022]. Viral infections are involved with 80 % of episodes of CAP in children under 2 years old and 49 % of older children [12].",
