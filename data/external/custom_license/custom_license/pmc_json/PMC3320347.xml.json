Five months (range 4.8 to 5.3 months) after participating in this initial study, 30 of these healthcare workers were asked to participate in another study. These workers were eligible for participation in this second investigation because they had entered the index patient's room from 24 hours before intubation to 4 hours after intubation. Both investigations involved telephone or face-to-face interviews to determine the amount of time the worker had spent in contact with the patient, the activities that had occurred while the worker was in the patient's room, and the personal protective equipment used by the worker. The second questionnaire was more detailed than the first but contained a substantial number of questions that were identical to those in the first questionnaire.",

The risk of droplet and airborne spread of communicable diseases is assumed to be greater if a patient is frequently coughing. Hence, different infection control precautions have been recommended when caring for patients who are coughing (7). However, our results suggest that recollection of contact during this activity may not be reliable. Whether this poor reliability is related to the effect of time on memory or the intermittent nature of coughing is unclear.",

Caring for patients with SARS can be a memorable and frightening event (8,9), and recall reliability in our study may not be generalized to other clinical situations. Furthermore, the similarities among questions during the 2 interviews may have resulted in the potential for recall bias, causing an overestimation of reliability within respondents (10). Finally, our study measured the reliability rather than the validity of healthcare worker recall for determining exposure risk. Nonetheless, our findings that healthcare workers reliably recalled exposure after several months following the event should be reassuring to investigators studying risk factors for SARS transmission in hospitals and to infection control practitioners assessing exposure to communicable diseases.",
