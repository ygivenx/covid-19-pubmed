The UK cluster appears to have originated from a man who recently travelled to Saudi Arabia, where NCoV was first isolated in September 2012. After two of the man's family members also fell ill, John Watson, the head of the UK's Health Protection Agency, said that such a cluster \u201csuggests that person-to-person transmission occurred\u201d but gave no reason for increased alarm, as indicated by an unchanged risk assessment from the WHO (Reuters, 13 Feb 2013).",

NCoV was confirmed in the two fatal cases, and the nine non-fatal cases were probable, but unconfirmed, NCoV infections. WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said, \u201cEven if the cases in Jordan were human-to-human spread \u2014 and we don't know that \u2014 it wasn't sustained.\u201d (NPR, 30 Nov 2012.)",

Thiel pointed out that the future of the virus is uncertain, but he reiterated the sentiments of the WHO by stating that \u201cSo far it looks like the virus is well contained, so in that sense I don't see any reason for increased fear\u201d (Reuters, 19 Feb 2013). Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK, said that \u201cAlthough it is severe, it's not doing anything worse than some other respiratory infections, it's just a new one.\u201d (BBC News, 13 Feb 2013.)",
