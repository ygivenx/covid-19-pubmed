Viruses that infect algal blooms, for example, induce the calcification of their hosts and are thus responsible for the white cliffs of Dover in Britain, and other carbon sinks. Acclaimed science writer Carl Zimmer celebrates the versatility of these agents in a dozen entertaining essays in his latest book, A Planet of Viruses, which accompanies the World of Viruses educational website (http://www.worldofviruses.unl.edu).",

There is food for thought here for all, even a seasoned virologist like me. Zimmer's writing grabs one's interest, but is marred by a lack of attention to detail. It would be a more attractive little volume if it were half as long again, because many of the essays end just when they become interesting.",

Dmitry Josifovich Ivanovsky is ignored in the account \u2014 even though he had also isolated and propagated tobacco mosaic virus from filtered plant sap six years earlier \u2014 because he thought it must be a bacterial disease. The property of transmission through a filter too fine for bacteria to pass through became the defining feature of a virus, thanks to Beijerinck but also to Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch, who reported the filterable nature of foot-and-mouth disease in the same year.",

One of the most fascinating tales of twentieth-century science is how viruses opened up molecular biology, but you won't find it here.",

            "text": "This year marks the centenary of Peyton Rous's demonstration that a cancer in chickens can be transmitted by a filterable agent. Zimmer's essay 'Rabbits with Horns' recalls Rous's pioneering work on tumour viruses, before introducing Richard Shope's discovery of the rabbit papilloma viruses, to which the essay title refers. Harald zur Hausen and colleagues discovered human cervical papilloma viruses in 1983; the vaccines that target them to protect women against cervical cancer were licensed in 2006. Thus, 100 years of tumour virology paid off. Rous may have had to wait longer than any other Nobel laureate to win his prize in 1966, whereas zur Hausen's 'incubation period' was a mere 25 years.",

No other replicating systems carry their genes in the form of RNA, as do polio, measles, influenza and most plant viruses. Some viruses have double-stranded RNA, whereas others are single-stranded; some viruses carry a single RNA or DNA molecule, and others have segmented genomes like the different chromosomes of higher organisms. Neither of the two chapters on retroviruses mentions reverse transcription \u2014 by which the RNA genome is turned into DNA before inserting itself into host DNA \u2014 even though the most potent anti-HIV drugs are designed to block this process.",

            "text": "Perhaps Zimmer thinks such facts are too difficult for his readership, but I view avoiding them as dumbing down. Which viruses evolved from bacteria, and which are more likely to have emerged as sets of genes that escaped from their hosts? Are some viruses relics from an RNA-based world, or are they relatively modern parasites derived from other living systems? Zimmer eventually raises the last question, but to my mind, the fascination of viruses is their enormous molecular and evolutionary diversity as much as their pervasiveness in the environment.",
