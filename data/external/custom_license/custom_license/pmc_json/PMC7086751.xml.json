The climate of Cuba is semitropical, and two seasons are generally recognized: a rainy season from May to October and dry season from November to April. Cuba is often hit by hurricanes from June to November, resulting in great economic loss and temporarily interrupted sanitary conditions. The average minimum temperature is 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F), and the average maximum is 27\u00b0C (81\u00b0F). The warmest month is July with 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). In this study, adenovirus was detected throughout the year; however, two significant outbreaks of HAdV infection were identified, the first in July of 2005, when Hurricane Dennis hit severely the western part of Cuba, and the second in September of 2006.

However, we detected HAdV-D in a child with bronchiolitis, and in 15 cases of upper respiratory infection. HAdV-D are rarely isolated in respiratory illness surveys, and strong causal correlations are generally lacking. Nevertheless, this association was previously described by Casas et al. [7]. On the other hand, HAdV-D was identified in a group of patients with acute febrile syndrome and in four isolates from clinical materials obtained from patients with encephalitis, AFP and meningoencephalitis. Sporadic cases or small outbreaks of neurological disease following adenovirus infection are well documented [12, 17, 25, 38]. The high prevalence of infection with HAdV-D in previously healthy patients is not consistent with previous reports. This association was unexpected, and a detailed analysis of this sample set will be published in a separate report.",

The liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, or heart may also be involved in disseminated infections, both in previously healthy people and in immunocompromised patients (e.g., infants, patients with AIDS, transplant recipients) [33]. HAdV-D has been frequently associated with severe adenovirus infection in these patients. In our study, we reviewed the medical records and did not find that the patients suffered from AIDS or another type of immunodeficiency. However, we thought that is important to take into account that the highest percentage of HAdV-D was identified in children.",

The sequencing of the hypervariable regions of the hexon gene (HVR7 alone or HVR1-6) and fiber gene of select strains will certainly provide a solid basis for confirming the species/serotype identification [29, 37, 43]. We used the method previously published by Casas et al. [7], to facilitate sequencing and typing of HAdVs using the hexon protein coding region of the HAdV genome. This method was extensively validated using clinical samples and prototype strains, and we also noted unusual associations between specific serotypes and clinical presentation. The primers and PCR conditions have also been extensively validated.",

Different serotypes have been found to have different tissue tropisms that correlate with different clinical manifestations of infection. Partial epidemiological investigations have revealed that, among some specific serotypes, multiple genetic variants exist that often have quite different geographical distributions and associated virulence [19, 21, 28, 30].",
