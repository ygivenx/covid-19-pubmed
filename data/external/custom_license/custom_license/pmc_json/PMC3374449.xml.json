Random hexamer primers synthesized by the oligonucleotide laboratory, Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, were used to create a cDNA library for each specimen. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with MuMLV RT (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Each cDNA was subsequently screened for the presence of HCoV-HKU1 by polymerase chain reaction with HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's specification.

The forward primer, 5\u00b4 GGTTGGGATTATCCTAAATGTGA, and reverse primer, 5\u00b4 CCATCATCACTCAAAATCATCATA, produce an amplicon that corresponds to nucleotides 15409\u201315848 of the HCoV-HKU1 replicase 1B gene (GenBank accession no. AY597011) and yields an amplicon of 439 bp. Amplification cycles were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15 min; followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min; and completed with a final extension cycle of 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Each set of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions contained appropriate negative controls.

Children whose specimens tested positive for HCoV-HKU1 infection had clinical evidence of either upper or lower respiratory tract infection or both (Table). The most common clinical findings were rhinorrhea (100%), cough (67%), fever (67%), and abnormal breath sounds on auscultation (44%). Hypoxia (oxygen saturation of <90%) was observed in only 1 patient. Chest radiographs were obtained for 4 patients, all of whom had abnormal findings that included peribronchial cuffing, atelectasis, hyperinflation, or infiltrates. One patient (patient 3) had respiratory decompensation requiring ventilatory support and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. This patient had no history of underlying illness, had not been premature, and was 1 month of age at the time of specimen collection.",

Although a febrile seizure remains a possible diagnosis, no evidence of fever was reported by the mother or noted during the hospital stay. A second patient (patient 7) was hospitalized with hepatitis. This patient had undergone liver transplantation 3 months before admission. Immunosuppressive medications included tacrolimus and prednisolone. The patient was also receiving ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis. The onset of abnormal liver enzyme levels occurred several days after the onset of respiratory symptoms and after collection of the respiratory specimen that tested positive for HCoV-HKU1. No evidence of abnormal liver function was detected (both prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were within normal ranges). Serologic assays for hepatitis viruses A, B, and C were negative. A liver biopsy specimen did not show evidence of rejection. Levels of the serum liver enzymes slowly decreased during hospitalization. No interventions (e.g., changes in immunosuppressive therapy) were performed.",

We detected this coronavirus in 1% of children screened. All HCoV-HKU1\u2013positive samples tested negative for RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, HCoV-NH, and human metapneumovirus. Our laboratory did not have access to materials from Hong Kong; therefore, the results cannot represent laboratory contamination from material obtained elsewhere. The percentage of positive specimens was similar to that described by Woo et al. (1 [0.25%] of 400) (14) and Sloots et al. (10 [3.1%] of 324) (15), which suggests that infection with HCoV-HKU1 may be uncommon or that the virus has properties that decreases the likelihood of detection, such as a brief period of viral shedding. Our study, the study by Sloots et al., and the original study by Woo et al. screened respiratory specimens submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. Therefore, HKU1 may be a common virus that causes symptomatic disease in only a relatively small percentage of infected persons. All HCoV-HKU1\u2013positive specimens were collected from December 2001 to February 2002, which implies a winter distribution. The study by Sloots et al. also detected HCoV-HKU1 predominantly in the winter, although only respiratory samples submitted during winter months were screened. Whether the seasonal distribution of HCoV-HKU1 varies from year to year is not known.",

Two of these patients had underlying illness. However, most patients identified in our study had only mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. Most HCoV-HKU1 infections in children, similar to other common HCoV infections, likely result in mild disease (4). The Australian study did not perform a detailed clinical review of HCoV-HKU1\u2013positive patients, but the authors note that symptoms are consistent with those of acute respiratory tract illness (15).The severity of disease caused by SARS-CoV in children was also relatively mild for reasons that are not yet understood (17).

HCoV-HKU1 is most closely related to the murine hepatitis virus, a virus that causes hepatitis as well as demyelinating disease in mice (18). Because of this patient's medical history (liver transplantation) and compromised immune status, many potential causes of hepatitis exist, though serologic assays and liver biopsy findings were unrevealing. Several reports have found coronavirus-like particles in stool of persons with gastrointestinal disease (19), which suggests that these viruses, like coronaviruses of animals, can cause disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Future studies will be needed to determine whether HCoV-HKU1, or other common human coronaviruses, play a role in liver disease.",

However, the region of the replicase 1B gene targeted by the primers used (14) is highly conserved among other coronaviruses, and our screening was unlikely to have lacked sensitivity for that reason. Also, only rare polymorphisms were detected on the sequence analysis of the 9 individual isolates, which suggests that this region is highly conserved.
