As such, Vancouver is a potential gateway to North America for emerging pathogens from Asia. Because of this perceived risk, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) had been increasing preparedness for pandemic threats for several years. An electronic distribution system was established to regularly disseminate communicable disease bulletins to healthcare facilities across the province. When a cluster of unexplained atypical pneumonia in China was reported almost simultaneously with reemergence of influenza A H5N1 in Hong Kong, BCCDC used this well-established communication network to issue an alert on February 20, 2003. The alert requested enhanced vigilance for severe influenzalike illness in returning travelers from mainland China or Hong Kong or among their close contacts. Alerts were repeated February 24, February 28, and March 12, 2003. Before patient 0's arrival, the emergency room at hospital A also participated in an infection control audit that emphasized that barrier precautions should be applied with all acute-onset respiratory infections. Patient 0 thus became the index patient in VCMA and was managed cautiously, even before WHO special alerts were issued. He sought treatment at the cusp of his peak infectious period at a tertiary-care hospital that had been repeatedly primed towards precaution. As a returned traveler, he was a first-generation case. He had no family contacts other than his wife, with whom he had traveled. Infection control precautions were implemented almost immediately upon his arrival at the hospital, limiting opportunities for spread.",

Responsibility for communicable disease control had shifted over the course of several years to local health boards, which created a decentralized system (12). Patient 0 in Toronto also stayed at Hotel M with her spouse from February 18 to 21. She returned to the GTA on February 23 to an apartment she shared with 5 family members (5,13). She died at home on March 5. During this period, she infected her 43-year-old son. This son became Toronto's index patient, a locally acquired, second-generation case (5,13). He went to a community hospital on March 7, the same day as Vancouver's patient 0, but was not recognized as a special threat. He was placed in general observation in the emergency room, where he remained for 18 hours and where he was given nebulized salbutamol. He was not placed in airborne isolation until he had been at the hospital for 21 hours; droplet and contact precautions were later begun on March 10 (5,13). By the time WHO issued its global alert, at least 14 persons in GTA had already become infected through 4 generations of spread: half within patient 0's family and the remainder among healthcare contacts. Concern about severe illness in family members as they sought treatment at the hospital prompted an evening phone consultation on March 13 from an infection control practitioner in Toronto to the BCCDC in Vancouver. This call linked the separate Toronto and Vancouver cases to events in Asia and led to recognition that SARS had spread beyond that region. It also prompted WHO to issue a rare travel advisory on March 15 (14). Thereafter, awareness of precautions to be taken was enhanced everywhere, and further importations into Canada (Vancouver and Toronto) did not result in spread.",

            "text": "Ultimately, standard droplet and contact precautions proved an effective barrier to SARS except in the context of superspreading events such as aerosolizing procedures (3). Low inherent transmissibility, combined with the delay in peak infectivity until well into the course of serious illness, may explain why SARS was primarily a nosocomial infection and why so few countries experienced outbreaks (3). Patient 0 tests the baseline capacity of a system to respond to emerging threats before they are known or recognized. While favorable random chance may have played a role, Vancouver's response to SARS should not be dismissed on the basis of luck alone. Pasteur's edict that \"chance favors only the prepared mind\" may have modern relevance to the prepared healthcare system (15). The response to patient 0 in Vancouver highlights the importance of central coordination, baseline preparedness at the local level, and an efficient network of communication in mitigating outbreaks. Baseline preparedness should include barrier precautions in the care of all acute-onset respiratory infections. These should be reinforced through timely public health alerts and periodic infection control audits.",
