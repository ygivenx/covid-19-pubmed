            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a spherical positive sense single-stranded RNA virus that is ubiquitous in wild and domestic Felidae family, with more than 90 percent prevalence in cats [1, 2]. The genome of this virus is approximately 30-kb in length with 11 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 25 structural, non-structural and accessory proteins [3]. This virus has two main prototypes; feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that usually causes subclinical or mild diarrhea with restricted infection in lower small intestine and colon [4] and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which cause a systemic disease with granulomatous serositis with high amount of protein effusion (effusive FIP) or necrotizing and inflammatory lesions in variety of organs (non effusive FIP) [3]. Probably, FIPV is a virulent virus that arose from mutation in some sites like ORF 3c, spike (S) gene, and ORF 7b of FECV, which would change the enterocytes tropism to monocyte/macrophage cells [5]. These mutations would shift the localized intestinal infection to the severe systemic infectious peritonitis. Both these viruses contain two different serotypes based on virus neutralizing antibody reactions and sequencing [6]. Type I FCoVs are unique in cats with predominant prevalence in Europe and Americas [5]. Type II FCoVs with more than 25 % prevalence in Asia is a double recombination of type I FCoVs and is closely related Canine CoV [7, 8].",

            "text": "Despite over 40 years of research, the mechanism of FIPV disease and induced immunity remains ambiguous. Severity of FIP is correlated with imbalance of B cells and T cells population, where the cell-mediated immunity can properly shift the disease to the dry form whilst, increase of B cells and antibody response can lead to type III hypersensitivity, antibody-dependent vasculitis and effusive form of the disease [6]. Hence, during FIPV infection, depletion of the lymphoid cells plays an important role in the virus pathogenesis [9]. In addition, infection of macrophages can increase B cells activity and contribute to antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of the symptoms and effusive form of the disease [5]. Since FIPV does not infect lymphocytes, it seems that this virus cause the lymphopenia through apoptosis induction. Studies have reported that apoptosis of mononuclear cells and particularly CD8+ T cells in infected cats is associated with the secretion of TNF-alpha from macrophages [10]. On the other hand, decreased of TNF-\u03b1 along with high amount of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2 resulted in the augmentation of these CD8+ T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the infected cats [11]. Therefore, apoptosis T cell is probably caused by soluble mediators released from infection to macrophages and/or intestinal epithelial cells [10]. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis during FIPV infection. The current study is investigating mode of cell death of Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells and the transcriptome of the infected cells following infection with FIPV WSU 79-1146. Furthermore, this study focused on understanding the apoptosis process during the infection and genes that may involve in apoptosis induction mechanism of the virus.",

The trimmed raw sequences were subjected to RNA-sequence analysis, by mapping them to an annotated feline genome reference sequence accounting for a maximum of two gaps or mismatches in each sequence. The relative transcript levels were considered as output and expressed as reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) [12].

The distribution of original expression values were found to be positively skewed for both control and infected samples where the median (M) value is higher in control (M = 1) compared to the infected sample (M = 0) (Fig. 3). Hence, the original expression values were normalized. The normalized expression values also resulted in positive skewed distribution in both control and infected samples. There were no outliers observed and both the control and infected samples possessed the same median (M = 1). The IQR for both samples was 10 and the range for both samples was also 10 (Fig. 3). As a result of normalization, both samples, on average possessed similar expression values and variability.

Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) analysis based on Panther database could analyze 2528 of these deregulated genes based on cellular processes, molecular functions and involved pathways. These genes were accounted for 4854 cellular processes involved in 17 cellular such as apoptosis, immune system and metabolic processes, whilst based on molecular functions, these genes were related to 2854 functions divided into 11 clusters, which mostly related to catalytic and binding activities. Tables 3 and 4 show the clusters of the affected genes by FIPV at 9 hpi according to different cellular processes and molecular functions, respectively. Panther pathway analysis revealed that 1096 of these genes belonged to 130 possible cellular pathways, which can be affected by FIPV at 9 hpi of the CRFK cells. Some of the most affected pathways include Wnt signaling, inflammation mediated by chemokines and cytokines signaling, integrin signaling and apoptosis signaling pathways. The pathways containing more than 10 deregulated genes are listed in Table 5. Among the resulted clusters, 131 genes were classified as apoptosis genes (80 down-regulated and 51 up-regulated genes) with absolute fold change more than 2 and FDR <0.05. In addition, 25 genes were detected from the apoptosis-signaling pathway.

Since specific feline TNF\u03b1 antibody is not available commercially, the kit for canine TNF\u03b1 detection, which has high homology to feline, was used during this analysis. Both RT-qPCR and ELISA analysis showed that TNF\u03b1 production would be significantly increased during first 48 hpi of FIPV. The production of this cytokine started to increase significantly (p < 0.05) at 3 hpi compared to negative control. At 9 hpi, although neither mRNA expression level and intracellular concentration of TNF\u03b1 did not show any significant difference with control, the extracellular concentration of this cytokine still showed significant higher concentration compared to uninfected cells; which probably explain the up regulation in other related genes at this time point.

In this study, we characterized FIPV infected cells based on flow cytometry measurement along with transcriptome analysis of genes that were deregulated in the infected cells. In addition to FIPV, CRFK cells have been used to study apoptosis of other feline viruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline calcivirus (FCV). Previous studies have shown that FIV can induce apoptosis in CRFK cells through TNF-\u03b1 signalling, caspase activation and NF-\u03baB pathways [14, 18], whilst, FCV also induce apoptosis of CRFK cells via mitochondrial pathways and activation of an executioner caspase like caspase 3 [19].

However, since FIPV does not replicate in peripheral blood lymphocytes, it is difficult to consider that lymphopenia is due to direct destruction by virus infection of lymphocytes. We hypothesized that FIPV infected cells might release mediators that cause the induction of apoptosis of lymphocytes. Study has shown that TNF-\u03b1 released from macrophages of FIP cats, induced apoptosis in lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells [10]. Transcriptome analysis of FIPV infected cells showed that the virus probably increase the inflammation through the chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways, Wnt signaling, Cadherin signaling, to name but a few (Tables 3, 4, 5). After 9 hpi, this virus could significant deregulate 4526 genes, which is much higher than 96 genes at 3 hpi according to a previous study by Harun et al. [22]. In addition, the expression of some of the ISG genes (e.g. ISG15 and ISG20), pro inflammatory and Th1-like cytokines (e.g. CCL8, CXCL10, and CCL17), genes related to innate immune responses (e.g. PHF11 and IRF1), and some genes like MX1 also showed significant up regulation (Supplementary Table 1), confirming the findings from previous study by Harun and his colleagues [22].",

A previous study has indeed indicated that VEGF is highly related to pyogranuloma and effusive form of the disease [23]. The importance of p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway in cytokines production also has been reported by Regan et al. [24] during FIPV infection. A study showed that medium from FIPV infected macrophage-derived (fcwf-4) cell line could not induce apoptosis to cultured T cells [20] proposing that mediators released from virus infection to epithelial cells may cause T cells death and depletion. This can explain the reason of chemokines and cytokines signaling augmentation in parallel with increase of apoptosis during the infection (Table 5). Furthermore, it has been reported that apoptosis prompt the activation of endogenous endonucleases, which lead to fragmentation of cellular DNA [20]. Hence, FIPV might use apoptosis as a viral strategy to enhance the spread of progeny to neighboring cells.",

Previous studies have indeed showed that TRADD up regulation can induced TNFR1 signaling pathways and caused both apoptosis and TNF mediated NF-kB activation [25, 26]. FADD protein also contains a death domain that act as a bridge between Fas receptors and different procaspases, which form the death-induction signaling complex (DISC) during apoptosis [27]. In addition to FADD, DAXX was also unregulated. The C-terminal of this protein can interact with FADD and also activate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and apoptosis pathways [28]. Hence, TNF- \u03b1 play a pivotal role in apoptosis during FIPV infection, and according to our results, both mRNA and protein levels of this cytokine were significantly increased in the first 3 hpi, which would affect many of aforementioned pathways that induce apoptosis.",

PDCD5 is a pro-apoptotic gene that is highly expressed in cells that undergo apoptosis [29] and may participate in the pathophysiologic course of disease involving abnormal programmed cell death [30].

Therefore, these two pathways would be affected from the first hour of infection. It is shown that TRAF2 depletion lowers the signal threshold for death receptor-mediated apoptosis [32]. The delicate balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules during coronavirus (CoV) infection enables rapid multiplication of virus before cell lysis [33]. It has been shown that anti-apoptotic response induced by SARS CoV infection in infected enterocytes is important to inhibit or delay cell destruction, which results in extending virus production and shedding. The SARS CoV has a protein named ORF 3a that shows high pro-apoptotic properties through the cell receptors and mitochondrial pathways [34]. Similarly, FIPV has a mutant of this protein that named ORF 3c with high expression in the death tissues of the infected cats [6]. However, the direct involvement of this gene in FIPV induced apoptosis of the infected cells has not been studied.",

Hence, it can be concluded that increase of communalities of pro apoptotic genes at this time point lead to significant augmentation of the number of early apoptosis cells and depletion of the viable cells. RASSF1 is known as a tumor suppressor gene by inducing cell cycle arrest at G(1)/S phase of cell cycle progression [35]. This gene can serve as a novel Ras effector [36], and enhance apoptosis [37]. Over expression of BATF2 or SARI (AP1-protein suppressor), another gene of interest of current study, can result in inhibition of DNA binding activation protein (AP1), which causes growth inhibition and induced apoptosis particularly in cancerous cells [38]. Hence, AP1 protein and IFN-\u03b2 can be another factors involved in FIPV apoptosis induction. The results of this study also showed significant (FDR <0.05) up regulation in IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 2 and down regulation of AP1 complex subunit beta-1 (AP1B1), which confirms the mechanism of action of BATF2 in apoptosis induction. Down regulation of BATF2 may result in poor prognosis of different types of carcinoma like hepato-cellular and squamous cell carcinoma [39, 40]. This gene is also up regulated in some other viral diseases like hepatitis E and hepatitis C [41, 42].",

Different MAGE genes play variety of roles in apoptosis and cell activities [44]. The activation of these genes make them the antigenic targets for immune system [44]. For instance, co expression of MAGED1 and P75NTR of the neutrophils will result in enhancement of cellular apoptosis [43].

This study managed to propose the onset time of early and late apoptosis in FIPV infection and also identified the factors and pathways involved during FIPV infection. More studies are required to understand the role of these genes from different cellular functions, molecular processes, and biological pathways during FIPV pathogenesis. Among variety of involved factors, we have underlined the importance of apoptosis during FIPV infection.",
