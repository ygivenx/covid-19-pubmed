A functional region has been identified on the S1 subunit of several coronavirus, called the receptor-binding domain (RBD) [5]. Certain residues in the RBD are critical for binding activity, and single mutations may abolish or change the binding activity of the virus [6]. In the case of IBV, the N-terminal portion of S1 (residues 19-272) was mapped as the binding domain of the Mass type strain M41 [7]. However, the S1 subunit is highly variable, and mutations have been found in S1 of different genotypes [8]. These mutations may influence the binding activity of RBD to host tissues. Thus, we attempted to identify the receptor-binding domain of a different genotype.",

In vivo, M41 is a respiratory IBV strain that mainly affects the upper respiratory tract. QX-like strains have been reported to be associated with distinct lesions of the proventriculus and kidney. M41 was first isolated in 1996 and is now becoming epidemic in China [10].

Sialic acid and heparan sulfate have been reported to be involved in IBV infection. Removal of sialic acid can abolish the binding of S1 to respiratory tissues [12, 13]. However, sialic acid is present on cells that are not sensitive to IBV, indicating that sialic acid is not the only molecule that binds to IBV [4]. Heparan sulfate was identified as a binding molecule only for the cell-adapted strain Beaudette, with the binding sites located within the S2 subunit (residues 686-691) [14]. Up to now, there has been little study of the protein involved in the binding process of IBV. In studies of SASR and 229E, RBDs showed specific binding to host receptors and showed higher binding activity than full-length S1 [15, 16]. This binding activity has been utilized to define the receptor of virus [17, 18]. In the present study, an affinity chromatography assay was used to isolate proteins that interacted with S1N-SCZJ3 [19]. Using an infection inhibition assay, we found that HSP70 is part of the receptor complex of IBV.",

However, the amino acid sequence from aa 19 to 36 is highly variable, and mutations may lead to conformational changes in S1N-SCZJ3 to S1N-M41. Two amino acid changes at the N-terminal spike protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus result in the loss of enteric tropism [25].
