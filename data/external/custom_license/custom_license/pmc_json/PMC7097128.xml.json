Respiratory infections are second only to cardiovascular disease in their effect on global health and especially affect people at the extremes of age. Respiratory viruses cause a spectrum of illness, ranging from an asymptomatic state to life-threatening multi-organ failure, and impose a vast socioeconomic burden1,2,3,4. The convergence of over 200 serologically distinct viruses into one ecological niche demonstrates both the unique vulnerability of the respiratory tract and the difficulty in making progress against such a diversity of pathogens.",

The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide depends on preservation of the delicate anatomical structures of the lungs that are relatively intolerant of physical or inflammatory damage. Lung tissues therefore maintain a fine balance, tolerating nonpathogenic environmental encounters but mounting a vigorous and effective response to harmful organisms. Mechanisms that prevent over-exuberant responses to environmental antigens include expression of the 'do not eat me' signal molecule CD200, the mucin MUC-1 and surfactant proteins, along with the reduced expression of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)20,21,22. In the event of infection, mechanisms to restore epithelial integrity and lung function are also rapidly engaged. For example, innate lymphoid cells are involved not only in the generation of proinflammatory cytokines but also in airway remodeling and tissue repair following infection with influenza virus23.",

Respiratory viruses enter via the respiratory epithelium and need to circumvent intrinsic mechanisms of protection, including mucus and antiviral peptides, that can prevent initial attachment and viral entry29,30 (Fig. 1). If these defenses are breached, epithelial cells have a central role in initiating the immune response by recognizing viral components via PRRs such as TLRs and intracellular sensors, including RIG-I-like receptors31. Ligation of these leads to a signaling cascade that results in the upregulation of type I and III interferons that trigger the inflammatory response, contribute to the differentiation of cells of the adaptive immune system and promote an antiviral state locally32.",

Although correlation is not proof of causation, it is highly plausible that antibodies at appropriate sites have a direct role in protection against both infection and systemic dissemination. Antibodies can neutralize infectivity directly by binding to viral surface proteins that are essential for entry of the virus into host cells (Figs. 1 and 2). This property underlies the most commonly used serological measure of immunity to influenza virus: hemagglutination inhibition. This detects hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibody by its ability to block the HA receptor-binding site, which prevents the clumping together of red blood cells after exposure to influenza virus in vitro40. Functional neutralizing antibodies to respiratory viruses (including influenza virus and RSV) can be measured by plaque-reduction assays, although such methods require standardization41,42,43. In addition to neutralizing viruses, antibodies can also act through the ligation of Fc receptors to enable triggering of the complement cascade and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity44,45 (Fig. 2). The importance of these mechanisms is less well defined than is the importance of virus neutralization, but these mechanisms may be important adjuncts for viral clearance and can also be quantified. The different aspects of antibody-mediated effector function that these assays measure are therefore important considerations in determining correlates of protection.",

However, peripheral blood is probably not the site at which antibodies are most important in preventing infection with respiratory viruses. Instead, exclusion by the immune system occurs mainly at the respiratory mucosa, where virus-specific antibodies act in concert with the physical barriers and antiviral substances secreted by respiratory epithelium46 (Fig. 1). Mucosal antibodies, particularly those in the upper respiratory tract, are mainly in the form of locally produced dimeric secretory IgA47, and IgA-deficient mice are highly susceptible to influenza virus48. IgA may also confer some cross-reactive protection against different strains of influenza virus49, but rapid mutation of viral HA and neuraminidase (NA) proteins allows this virus to evade the immune system. Although titers of circulating antibodies can correlate with protection against infection, this may be because they reflect local protective IgA; IgG also is thought to have a direct role in defense of the lower respiratory tract, where it is more abundant than in the nasal mucosal fluid50. In RSV disease, this is illustrated by the clinical efficacy of the humanized mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody palivizumab, the administration of which reduces hospitalization of premature infants by up to 78% but does not reliably prevent nasal infection51.",

Mature DCs migrate to secondary and tertiary lymphoid tissues, carrying virus-derived antigens, which are presented to B cells that migrate through the nodal tissue (Fig. 2). The recognition of antigen begins a program of differentiation that causes migration to the edge of the lymphoid follicle and proliferation. Contact with CD4+ helper T cells, which recognize cognate antigen presented by the B cell via major histocompatibility complex class II, leads to immunoglobulin isotype class switching from IgM to IgG or IgA and proliferation56,57. This occurs through interactions of the costimulatory receptor CD40 with its ligand CD40L and cytokine signaling via interleukin 4 (IL-4), IFN-\u03b3 and (particularly in the case of IgA) transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Short-lived plasmablasts are formed at this stage, while some B cells progress to participate in the germinal center (GC) reaction, where somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation occur, promoted by specialized CD4+ follicular helper T cells (TFH cells) that express the costimulatory receptor ICOS, the costimulatory molecule PD-1, IL-21 and other markers driven by the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 (refs. 58,59,60). Following multiple rounds of selection, high-affinity antibody-secreting cells are generated, as are non\u2013antibody-secreting memory B cells. The former are responsible for the abrupt increase in antibody titers that occurs relatively early during infection, but this population contracts following antigen clearance, leaving a small number of long-lived plasma cells61. These cells migrate to survival niches that include the bone marrow and respiratory mucosa, and they are responsible for the maintenance of long-term antibody titers62. TLR signaling is crucial in this process, with TLR9 and TLR10 on B cells potentially directly promoting immunoglobulin production63. Adjuvants can enhance antibody production via similar B cell\u2013intrinsic mechanisms, with 'imprinting' of B cells leading to upregulation of the Bcl-6 homolog Zbtb20 and promoting the long-term survival of plasma cells64. The number and persistence of plasma cells are thus determined by a sequence of fate 'decisions' that depends on the integration of a variety of signals: the immediate 'choice' between the proliferation or death of perifollicular B cells in the first 3 days after antigen encounter; differentiation into short-lived extra-follicular plasma cells or participation in the GC reaction; positive selection of the affinity of the B cell receptor for viral antigen (rather than self antigen) for the generation of B cell clones of increasingly higher affinity; and the long-term survival versus death of the resultant antibody-secreting cells65.",

The secondary activation of memory B cells leads to early proliferation and the production of antibodies, whereas a subset of these cells go on to participate once again in the GC reaction for further affinity maturation and replenishment of the memory pool. The fate of these memory B cells is probably determined at an early stage, with markers (including CD80 and PD-L2) defining subsets that are to undergo early differentiation into plasmablasts or those that reenter the GC66. B cell memory is particularly important for responses to respiratory viruses, to which people are commonly exposed multiple times throughout their lives. Classically, recurrent encounter with viral antigens should lead to boosting of antibody titers that ultimately leads to complete protection. However, respiratory viruses have evolved diverse ways of evading host immunity. These strategies include the aforementioned mutation of genes encoding the surface antigenic determinants HA and NA of influenza virus, or the reassortment of gene segments that leads to wholesale replacement of these by variants from zoonotic strains to which human populations have no preexisting immunity67. Similarly, rhinoviruses have diversified into over 150 distinct serotypes against which cross-protection is weak or nonexistent68. In contrast, RSV is relatively well conserved, with only the attachment G glycoprotein displaying substantial antigenic diversity69. Despite the fact that the other major RSV surface antigen, F protein, is more highly conserved across RSV strains and F protein\u2013specific antibodies are easily detected in all adults, recurrent infection with RSV occurs throughout life even in the absence of any immunological defect70. This might be explained by the expression of various proteins with immunomodulatory potential that can affect immunological memory, including the nonstructural proteins that interfere with type I and III interferons and a fractalkine-like motif in G protein71,72. The reasons underlying the remarkably rapid decrease in protective immunity after infection with RSV and the short half-life of RSV-specific antibodies remain unknown but probably explain the lifelong susceptibility to recurrent infection with this virus73.",

            "text": "TFH cells were first described as a CD4+ T cell subset in the tonsils specialized to help the generation and maintenance of high-affinity B cells and antibody responses58. TFH cells express a characteristic set of markers, including the chemokine receptor CXCR5 (to allow homing to the GCs, where they chiefly reside), PD-1, ICOS, CD28, CD40L, SAP and their lineage-specifying transcription factor Bcl-6. Their localization in GCs allows close contact with proliferating B cells and follicular DCs. TFH cells can deliver signals to promote 'preferential' selection, with further differentiation allowing B cells to out-compete low-affinity suboptimal clones74. As well as participating in direct cell-to-cell signaling, TFH cells produce IL-21, which promotes isotype switching to IgA and enhances Bcl-6 expression in B cells, thus augmenting memory generation75. TFH cells are therefore essential for durable protective antibody responses and are potentially key to the efficient generation of vaccine-induced antiviral immunity. In some respiratory infections, such as infection with RSV, impairment of antigen presentation to T cells or inhibition of type I interferon signaling can have a role in modulating TFH cell responses18. Although there are as yet no data on TFH cells in human infection with RSV, it is possible that a defect in TFH cell help (such as impaired IL-21 signaling) might contribute to the poor longevity of RSV-specific antibody responses.",

In common with GC B cells, TFH cells express Bcl-6, and expression of this factor in both cell types is required for the GC reaction to occur. Bcl-6 expression in TFH cells suppresses the expression of other lineage-specific transcription factors and removes the effect of microRNAs that suppress ICOS, PD-1 and CXCR5, thus promoting the TFH cell phenotype76. However, the key triggers for differentiation into the TFH cell phenotype remain controversial. CD4+ T cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity, and conversion between TFH cells and other subsets of helper T cells (including TH1, TH2 and TH17 cells) has been described in various systems depending on the environmental context, cytokine milieu and infection type. In vitro, TFH cells can be induced to express type 1, 2 and 17 cytokines with the appropriate polarizing signals and, in some animal models, can also be shown to express these in vivo77. However, several studies suggest that the lineage 'decision' between TH1 cells and TFH cells occurs early during the activation of naive CD4+ T cells and that the TFH cell phenotype is maintained stably into the memory phase78. This may be due to persistent antigen availability, with longer engagement of the T cell antigen receptor promoting the TFH cell fate over the TH1 lineage fate79. Conversely, in a mouse model of infection with influenza virus, IL-2 has been shown to polarize CD4+ T cells to a TH1 phenotype and away from the TFH cell phenotype, with defective GC B cell responses when systemic IL-2 is administered80.",

Diversity of signal intensity, antigen availability, costimulatory signaling and the cytokine milieu leads to a heterogeneous population of memory T cells that can be categorized into functional subsets in both animal models and humans according to their expression of surface markers100. Until recently, two major subsets of memory T cells had been recognized: central memory T cells that express the lymph node\u2013homing receptor CD62L and chemokine receptor CCR7, which allows them to circulate between blood and lymphoid tissues; and effector memory T cells that do not express those receptors and display heightened effector ability. Together, these populations have the ability to self-renew and, on reencountering their cognate antigen, proliferate rapidly while upregulating cytotoxic and other effector molecules.",

            "text": "The developmental pathway for lung TRM cells remains to be elucidated but seems to require a sequence of differentiation steps. In the draining lymph nodes, antigen presentation by CD103+ DCs predisposes CD8+ T cells to effector differentiation, with the ability to enter inflamed tissues via the expression of such receptors as CCR5 and downregulation of CD62L107. This contrasts with CD11bhi DCs, which 'preferentially' prime central memory T cell\u2013like cells. In addition, effector T cells destined for the lungs can express a combination of chemokine receptors, including CXCR3 and CCR4 (refs. 108,109). In the genital mucosa of mice, macrophages make the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL9, which attract and retain TRM cells110. Following the migration of TRM cells to sites of infection, the strength of signaling via the T cell antigen receptor and availability of additional signals via costimulatory receptors and cytokines (such as IL-12) drive differentiation toward a terminally differentiated short-lived effector state or (later in the course of infection) toward memory precursor cells111. Environmental cues probably govern commitment to the TRM cell phenotype; for example, CD103 is not expressed on herpes simplex virus\u2013specific CD8+ T cells until they have been present in infected skin for a certain length of time105. Important among local signals is TGF-\u03b2, produced by regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and, to a lesser extent, activated CD4+ T cells in the respiratory epithelium. Upon recognition of antigen presented by DCs, CD4+ T cells secrete the 'latent' form of TGF-\u03b21; this dimer of TGF-\u03b21 and the latency-associated protein LAP interacts with integrin \u03b1V\u03b28 on DCs (or specific microbial proteases such as influenza virus neuraminidase112), which triggers release of the active form of TGF-\u03b21. This acts on naive CD4+ T cells to inhibit the differentiation of high-affinity TH1 or TH2 cells and (with IL-2 and retinoic acid) promotes the differentiation of induced Treg cells. In the presence of IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 drives the differentiation of regulatory TH17 cells113 (Fig. 3).",

It is also intriguing that lung TRM cells selectively express the interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM3, which is defective in some cases of severe infection with influenza virus115.

Following infection of mice with RSV, depletion of either CD4+ T cell populations or CD8+ T cell populations typically leads to a reduction in disease severity but also impairment in the clearance of virus90 (Fig. 1). However, in severe respiratory viral infection, it seems likely that runaway activation of adaptive immunity (either through dysregulation of the immune system or driven by reduced viral control by host immunity) is a major component. For example, highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus, including recently emerged avian H5N1 strains that have crossed over into human populations, encode NS1 proteins that not only interfere with type I interferon activity but also are associated with increased release of inflammatory cytokines122. RSV also encodes an NS1 that suppresses type I interferons, and there is evidence that RSV G protein contains a region that has structural similarity to the chemokine fractalkine and thus promotes inappropriate inflammatory responses72,114,123,124.",

Treg cells are characterized by expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 and make up 5\u201310% of all CD4+ T cells. Treg cells that differentiate in the thymus act mainly to maintain tolerance to self antigens. In contrast, inducible Treg cells are generated following exposure to cognate antigen in the context of cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2. Following infection with RSV, activated Treg cells accumulate in the mouse lungs and reduce disease severity, suppressing antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells135. They also have a role in controlling vaccine-enhanced disease following vaccination with FI-RSV, for which transfer of conventional CD4+ T cells augments disease, whereas recruitment of Treg cells to the lungs ameliorates it130. Thus, the unregulated promotion of proinflammatory adaptive immune responses by vaccination may not be wholly desirable, and the role of immunomodulatory mechanisms in other respiratory viral infections will need to be considered in more detail.",

Both IIV and LAIV must be reformulated each year, and unexpectedly poor matching of vaccine with circulating strains of influenza virus can reduce efficacy to less than 50% even in those with healthy mature immune systems136. While LAIV is delivered intranasally and has been shown to induce a mucosal immune response more akin to natural infection, there is no demonstrated effect of LAIV on heterosubtypic immunity. Furthermore, LAIV is generally ineffective in older adults in whom preexisting immunity blocks local infection and the vaccine-induced immune response137.",
