            "text": "How can we prevent Staphylococcus aureus infections, given that resistance to antibiotics is on the rise and effective vaccinations remain elusive? One solution may be directly under our noses. Approximately 20% of the human population carries strains of S. aureus in their nasal cavities. Not only are these strains responsible for around 80% of invasive S. aureus infections, but individuals with persistent nasal S. aureus colonization are more likely to develop infection. But to therapeutically target S. aureus nasal colonization, which could reduce infection, it would be useful to first determine the S. aureus colonization factors. To this end, Heiman Wertheim, from the University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues inoculated 16 healthy individuals (or 32 healthy nostrils) with 2 strains of S. aureus (1 for each nostril). Whereas one nostril received a wild-type strain, the other received a mutant that lacked the cell-wall protein clumping factor B (ClfB); ClfB enables colonization in mice, but its importance for human colonization was unknown. After 2 weeks, the wild-type strain persisted in 3 volunteers, whereas the mutant strain persisted in none. These findings indicate that ClfB is necessary for human nasal colonization and might be a potential target for strategies to reduce S. aureus infection. PLoS Med.",

            "text": "By generating a 'safe' form of Ebola virus, researchers may have made it possible for research laboratories around the world to study Ebola. Because Ebola virus causes deadly haemorrhagic fever, has a 50\u201390% mortality rate and cannot be treated, the virus can currently only be studied in laboratories that are rated at biosafety level 4 (BSL4) \u2014 the highest rating. Peter Halfmann, from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, United States, and colleagues removed the gene that encodes VP30, a transcription factor that is crucial for viral replication, from the Ebola genome. Consequently, the modified Ebola strain, which is genetically stable and morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type Ebola, can only reproduce inside genetically modified cells that express VP30. So, if the modified Ebola virus escapes from the Petri dish, laboratory workers need not fear infection. If approved by national regulatory bodies \u2014 and if safeguards can be met to ensure that the 'contained' virus is not inadvertently converted back into the lethal form \u2014 Ebola may be coming soon to a BSL2 or BSL3 laboratory near you.

Curiously, the bacteria can also persist inside vacuoles in liver granuloma macrophages, with unknown effect. John Brumell, from the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, and colleagues now report that the toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) promotes the formation of so-called spacious Listeria-containing phagosomes (SLAPs), which enable the pathogen to establish persistent infections. In the livers of severe combined immunodeficient mice and in macrophages in vitro, the authors observed L. monocytogenes in compartments they named SLAPs. Whereas phagosomes naturally mature into degradative phagolysosomes, SLAPs do not. Although L. monocytogenes can replicate inside SLAPs (in \u223c8 hours), the rate is far slower than in the cytosol (\u223c40 minutes). Intriguingly, SLAP formation depends on the expression of the bacterial protein LLO and on autophagy. The authors suggest that SLAPs represent a stalemate between L. monocytogenes and its host; the host prevents rapid colonization by forcing the bacteria into SLAPs, but is unable to fully eliminate the bacteria.

Two competing, although unverified, theories had been postulated for the emergence of syphilis in Europe. First reported in 1495, some say that syphilis circulated in Europe for centuries before it became virulent and was recognized; others propose that Columbus brought it over from the Americas. Harper and colleagues built a phylogenetic tree by comparing 21 genetic regions of 26 disparate strains of Treponema species, including the subspecies that causes syphilis. The syphilis-causing strains were most closely related to, although evolutionarily younger than, South American yaws-causing strains. As yaws is a tropical disease that is transmitted by skin\u2013skin contact, the first syphilis-causing strain would have needed to evolve into a venereal form before it could spread between heavily clad Europeans in cooler climates. Some researchers, however, want to see a comparison of the full genomes, rather than only the 21 regions, before they will be convinced that syphilis was really a case of Montezuma's revenge.

Now, Larry Brilliant, Director of Google.org, has announced that the organization will fund five philanthropic initiatives, which will include the development of early warning systems for emerging threats, such as infectious diseases. Their approach to these systems is twofold: first, identify hot spots, and second, enable a rapid response. To this end, Google.org is funding various projects, such as InSTEDD (Innovative Support to Emergencies, Diseases and Disasters), which will build platforms to rapidly detect and respond to health threats, and HealthMap, which will study how online data can be used in disease surveillance. Spending is currently far less than the 1% that was initially pledged, but if the pilot projects do well then Google's giving is expected to increase. Google.org/Economist",

Currently, H5N1 HA has high specificity for the avian-like \u03b12,3 sialylated glycans, but poor specificity for human-like \u03b12,6 sialylated glycans. Aarthi Chandrasekaran and colleagues from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States, used various techniques to investigate how HA specificity is determined. Their findings revealed that it is the structural topology, rather than the biochemical linkage, of the sialylated glycans that determines specificity. Whereas avian \u03b12,3 sialylated glycans are cone shaped, human \u03b12,6 sialylated glycans are umbrella shaped. Thus, a preference for cone-shaped sialylated glycans may have stopped H5N1 from spreading throughout the human population. The authors suggest that arrays of umbrella-shaped \u03b12,6 sialylated glycans may be useful tools to monitor whether avian 'flu viruses are adapting to human hosts. Nature Biotechnol./BBC",

In addition, its incidence has tripled in the United States in the past 20 years. Although these findings suggest that MCC may have an infectious origin, no causative agent has been identified. To investigate this possibility, Patrick Moore and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, United States, screened MCC skin samples for non-human DNA. Although 8 of the 10 MCC samples possessed a polyomavirus, only 4 of the 25 control skin samples possessed the virus. As this virus had never been identified before, the authors named it Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Further analysis revealed that MCV DNA was integrated into the genomes of six of the eight MCC tumours. Taken together, these findings suggest that MCV might be a contributing factor in MCC pathogenesis. Science",
