One learns such things as the origin of the word \u201cquarantine,\u201d the complexities of preparing a certification examination, and the sheer terror of being on the front lines of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In short, the volume explains why things are the way they are in travel medicine and why this new discipline has, of necessity, become a separate specialty.",

Much of the book reads like a medical detective story; other parts read like a medical journal but the writing is more compelling.",
