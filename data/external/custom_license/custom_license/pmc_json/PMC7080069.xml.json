Causes of death included an overwhelming viral infection and primary or secondary bacterial infection. Because of the presumed high frequency of bacterial infection, most hospitalised patients with influenza pneumonia are administered antibiotics, even though bacterial co-infection is considered unlikely [2]. Indeed, bacterial pneumonia cannot be differentiated from viral pneumonia on the basis of the patients\u2019 characteristics, chest radiographic findings or routine laboratory results. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a recognised marker of bacterial infection and might be a prognostic marker in lower respiratory tract infections [3]. Few studies have assessed PCT levels in viral infections, except for paediatrics studies in which PCT was found to help distinguishing viral from bacterial meningitis [4] or pneumonia [5]. A small study in Singapore during the Coronavirus outbreak suggested that PCT remained at low levels in viral infections [6].",

The \u2018true\u2019 proportion of patients with bacterial co-infection during influenza pneumonia is also difficult to ascertain. However, by excluding patients having received prior antibiotics, thus allowing a more accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection, we believe we have come closer to estimating the frequency and influence of bacterial co-infection in patients with severe influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia. PCT levels appear to discriminate well between patients having or not having bacterial co-infection during influenza pneumonia. Despite the small sample of patients in our series in whom both measurements of PCT and CRP were obtained, PCT levels appeared to more accurately discriminate viral from mixed viral and bacterial infection among patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia of suspected viral origin during the influenza epidemic.",

Measurements of PCT levels at admission can help discriminate patients having bacterial co-infection from those with isolated viral pneumonia. Clinical trials from different settings have established that PCT can be safely used to help decide upon initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy, and thus potentially help to reduce antibiotic overuse [9, 15]. When combined with clinical judgment during influenza epidemics, a low PCT level may identify a subgroup of patients in whom empiric antibiotic therapy may be withheld or withdrawn early.",
