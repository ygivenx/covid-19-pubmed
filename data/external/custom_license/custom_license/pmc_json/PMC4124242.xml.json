            "text": "Treatments that help eradicate chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are essential for preventing disease progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1]. Interferon (IFN) is the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C, and the combination of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (pegIFN-\u03b1) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy produces a sustained anti-viral response (SVR) in 50 % of patients infected with high viral loads of HCV genotype 1. Furthermore, higher SVR rates follow triple therapy with pegIFN-\u03b1 and RBV plus telaprevir or simeprevir [2]. However, some patients fail to complete IFN treatments because of adverse effects such as interstitial pneumonia (IP), which is known as a critical adverse effect and can lead to death [3], and cardiovascular events such as arrhythmia, which are rare among IFN-treated hepatitis C patients [4]. In contrast, the rates of treatment discontinuation and/or dose modification due to severe adverse effects of natural IFN-\u03b2 (nIFN-\u03b2) are reportedly low [5, 6], and the efficacy of combination therapy with RBV for genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C has been demonstrated [6].",

            "text": "A 56-year-old female visited our hospital for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in 1996. She was 153 cm in height and weighed 53.0 kg. In 1984, she had received surgery for an ovarian cyst and showed abnormally high transaminase levels at that time. She had never received blood transfusions, did not consume alcohol, and had no other history of serious illness. However, she had suffered from allergic reactions to several medicines, including urticaria following chloramphenicol and tetracycline treatments, angioedema from a sulfa drug, a reddish skin reaction following a patch test for fosfomycin calcium and skin disinfection with ethanol, and suffered from liver injury after treatment with oxatomide. In 1991, she was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C, and in 1995, she was treated with IFN-\u03b12b for 6 months. Although a transient biochemical response was achieved, hepatitis relapsed 7 months after cessation of IFN therapy, prompting treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). After a subsequent visit to our hospital, laboratory examinations revealed the following biochemical levels: aspartate aminotransferase, 117 IU/l; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 189 IU/l; albumin, 5.0 g/dl; \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, 26 IU/l; platelet count, 16.3 \u00d7 104/\u00b5l; \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) <5 ng/ml. She carried HCV genotype 1 and had a viral load of 5.5 Meq/ml. Hepatitis B virus surface antigens and antinuclear antibodies were negative, and thyroid function was normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed no cirrhosis, no fatty liver, and no mass lesions in the liver, and the patient was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1, with a high viral load that was refractory to IFN monotherapy. After addition of glycyrrhizin injections to UDCA therapy, her ALT levels gradually decreased, but fluctuated between 40 and 70 IU/l (Fig. 1). In April 2002, examinations of a liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis (New Inuyama classification F2/A2), and combination therapy commenced with daily administration of 6 mega units (MU) IFN-\u03b12b for 2 weeks and then three times per week, and RBV at 600 mg/day. Four weeks later, HCV-RNA levels were assessed using an Amplicor Monitor and decreased from 400 to less than 0.5 KIU/ml. However, the patient complained of an occasionally slow pulse, and a Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) after 5 weeks of treatment revealed advanced atrial ventricular (AV) block (Fig. 2a). After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient complained of palpitation attacks that persisted for more than 4 h, and ECG monitoring revealed supraventricular tachycardia of 170 beats/min (Fig. 2b). After hospital admission, her symptoms gradually subsided but sometimes relapsed, and Holter ECG showed similar supraventricular tachycardia and AV block type 2 of the second degree (Fig. 2c). Although an echocardiogram assessment showed no abnormalities, IFN treatment was considered to be the cause of arrhythmia and was stopped at the 7th week of therapy. For 4 months, arrhythmia occurred intermittently after IFN discontinuation, but it completely disappeared thereafter. She was then treated with glycyrrhizin injections and UDCA therapy. However, her ALT levels were not controlled and AFP levels gradually increased to more than 10 ng/ml. In 2007, treatment with 90-\u00b5g pegIFN-\u03b12a every 7\u201310 days was started to control hepatitis. ALT and AFP levels subsequently normalized, but mild cough and sputum occurred from the 8th week of treatment. A local doctor then medicated the patient with an antitussive agent, but her symptoms deteriorated and she complained of shortness of breath at the 11th week of pegIFN-\u03b12a treatment. Although her ALT and AFP levels remained normal and HCV-RNA levels decreased to 8.2 KIU/ml, a fine crackle was heard in her bilateral anterior lower chest, and her KL-6 levels increased to 780 U/ml. Although pulmonary function tests were normal, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest revealed bilateral linear and lenticular interstitial opacities, predominantly in the lung bases and periphery, indicating IP (Fig. 3). Thus, PegIFN-\u03b12a treatments were immediately discontinued, and the patient was administered theophylline and expectorants. Gradual recovery was observed, and no respiratory symptoms appeared after 3 months, even after cessation of treatments. Although HRCT observations were almost unchanged, serum KL-6 decreased to 427 U/ml, and glycyrrhizin injections and UDCA therapy were resumed. In 2008, the patient strongly requested treatment with IFN following insufficient efficacy of other treatments and commenced with 6-MU doses of nIFN-\u03b2 three times a week under careful observation. Although no respiratory symptoms occurred and AFP levels were normalized, her ALT levels were insufficiently controlled, HCV-RNA levels were unchanged (from 4.9 to 4.9 log IU/ml), and the treatment was stopped after 6 months.",

Although no respiratory symptoms appeared, the patient was unable to tolerate the treatment and suffered severe neurovegetative symptoms, including fever, fatigue, nausea, and tinnitus, and she discontinued treatment after 2 weeks. In September 2009, semiweekly treatments with 6-MU nIFN-\u03b2 were resumed. Laboratory data and HCV characteristics before treatment and the interleukin 28B genotype are shown in Table 1. Although AFP levels were normalized after 3 months, ALT levels and HCV-RNA load did not decrease. Therapy was continued without remarkable adverse effects, and in January 2010 (4 months after nIFN-\u03b2 initiation), nIFN-\u03b2 treatment was increased to three times a week with 600-mg/day RBV. Her HCV-RNA levels subsequently decreased from 5.1 to 3.4 log IU/ml at the 4th week and to 2.4 log IU/ml by the 8th week. After 24 weeks, serum HCV-RNA became undetectable, and the patient completed 72 weeks of combination therapy, which finally led to an SVR.",

It is well known that IFN treatment induces adverse effects that occasionally lead to treatment discontinuation in patients with viral hepatitis. In previous studies, rates of premature discontinuation of IFN monotherapy due to adverse effects in chronic hepatitis C patients were 4\u20139 % [7, 8], and they were 7\u201312 % for RBV combination therapy [9]. Apart from hematologic disorders, neurovegetative symptoms and depression-related syndromes are the predominant reasons for discontinuation of both IFN monotherapy and RBV combination therapy [8, 10], and dermatologic effects are also common after RBV combination therapy. Adverse cardiac events due to IFN treatments are rare among hepatitis C patients [11], and reported treatment discontinuation rates are 0.1 and 0.96 % [12, 13]. Large studies show less frequent occurrence of these events [4, 10]. However, some severe cases reportedly developed severe arrhythmia and required intensive care or cardiac pacemakers [4, 14, 15]. In contrast, the side effects of such events due to IFN-\u03b2 treatment have been reported in only one patient with multiple sclerosis, who was treated with recombinant IFN-\u03b21a [16]. Moreover, adverse cardiac effects were abolished in chronic hepatitis C patients after changing from IFN-\u03b1 to nIFN-\u03b2 treatments [17].",

            "text": "Although IP is a well-known adverse effect of IFN treatments for hepatitis C patients, and sometimes leads to death [20], it occurs at a rate of only 0.3 % among Japanese patients treated with IFN monotherapy or combined RBV therapy [10, 12] and in only 0.01 % of patients in other countries [21]. To date, retreatment with IFN after the occurrence of IP has been reported in only three patients with hepatitis C. Of these, two cases changed from IFN-\u03b12b or pegIFN-\u03b12b to pegIFN-\u03b12a and experienced relapse of IP [22, 23], whereas the other case changed from pegIFN-\u03b12a to pegIFN-\u03b12b and completed the therapy without relapse [24]. The incidence of IP due to IFN varies with IFN types and reportedly occurs in 0.29 % of cases for pegIFN-\u03b12a, 0.12 % of cases for IFN-\u03b12b, and 0.04 % of cases for nIFN-\u03b2 [25]. In addition, the incidence of depression is lower after treatment with nIFN-\u03b2 than with other types of IFN, and nIFN-\u03b2 is generally tolerated in patients with a history of depression [26]. Furthermore, treatment discontinuation and/or dose reduction rates due to severe adverse effects during IFN-\u03b2 treatment are generally low [5]. Thus, the Japan Society of Hepatology recommends the use of IFN-\u03b2 in patients who are unable to tolerate IFN-\u03b1 because of depression or other adverse effects [27]. Although the mechanisms behind improved tolerability of IFN-\u03b2 remain unclear, drug concentrations after administration vary depending on the type of IFN [28], with much higher sustained serum concentrations of IFN-\u03b12a than nIFN-\u03b2. This may reflect the production of IFN-\u03b12a using genetic recombination and/or its requirement of subcutaneous administration. In contrast, nIFN-\u03b2 is produced using human fibroblasts and is intravenously administered. Furthermore, the intracellular mechanisms of action may also differ between these IFNs. Although IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 bind to a common type I IFN receptor, they utilize different regions of the subunit for signaling [29], producing different signaling and biological effects. In accordance, higher SVR rates have been shown with nIFN-\u03b2 plus RBV therapy than with IFN-\u03b1 plus RBV therapy [30], and a previous case study shows SVR following nIFN-\u03b2 plus ribavirine therapy after several unsuccessful courses of IFN-\u03b1 therapy with and without RBV [31].",
