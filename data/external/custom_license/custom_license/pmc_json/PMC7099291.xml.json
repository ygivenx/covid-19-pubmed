Nonetheless, the incidence of NEC among the population of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants at our hospital has been decreasing over the years, as has the incidence of mortality and morbidity from this disease. Over the past 2 years, however, our hospital has experienced an increase in the incidence of full-term babies exhibiting NEC. NEC in full-term infants is well documented, accounting for about 10% of babies with NEC; it usually involves babies with known risk factors, such as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, gastroschisis, polycythemia, hypoglycemia, sepsis, exchange transfusion, umbilical lines, milk allergy, premature rupture of membranes with and without chorioamnionitis and gestational diabetes.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 The purpose of the current study was to characterize this group of full-term infants with NEC, to discover whether there are any common known risk factors, and to review the relevant literature.",

This increase has been conspicuous mainly over the last 2 years, as shown in the table. The incidence of CS increased from 19% in 1998 to 24% in 2002 (in comparison to 14 to 16% in the previous 5 years). During the 5 years of the study, 14 full-term infants were found to have NEC. In this same period, the rate of NEC among VLBW infants born at our hospital decreased from 5.1% in 1998 to 2% in 2002. Maternal diseases observed in this group of infants included gestational diabetes, hypothyroidism and Turner's syndrome. All but one of the infants with NEC were born by CS, six due to nonreassuring fetal heart rate monitoring without apparent birth asphyxia (with one exception). The other seven infants were born by elective CS due to breech presentation, twin pregnancy or previous CS. As shown in Table 2, seven infants had known predisposing risk factors for NEC, such as growth retardation, polycythemia, congenital hypothyroidism, birth asphyxia, congenital heart malformation, and one infant with an as yet undiagnosed syndrome. The other seven infants either exhibited no obvious predisposing risk factors or had some common mild conditions, such as hyperbilirubinemia, early asymptomatic hypoglycemia and transient tachypnea. None of these infants was entirely breast-fed. The age of NEC onset in most of these babies was only a few days, except for two infants (N 2&4), with congenital heart disease and undiagnosed syndrome, respectively.",

Another seven infants were born by elective CS. The possible relationship between increasing rates of CS and early NEC in full-term infants may be explained by the fact that sicker infants are saved by CS and by improved neonatal resuscitation. However, the low rate of birth asphyxia in the study group as well as the high rate of elective CS do not support such a hypothesis. So far, CS on its own has not been considered a risk factor for NEC by most authors, although Uauy et al.15 did mention CS as a significant risk factor in their group of VLBW infants with NEC. Recently, Minkoff and Chervenak16 discussed a possible mechanism by means of which the anesthesia involved in elective CS causes a possible transient drop of blood pressure, perhaps thus compromising placental blood supply and fetal circulation. In addition, the maternal supine position prior to and during the operation may further reduce fetal circulation and thus interfere with intestinal blood supply. The increasing incidence of CS in our institution may play some role in the higher incidence of NEC observed in this study. About 90% of all elective CS in our institution are under epidural anesthesia capable of compromising splanchnic blood supply to the fetus. This hypothesis should be further investigated by means of fetal Doppler blood flow measurements.",

The first was the case of a 10-day-old full-term infant with a history of hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy. Positive clinical signs included persistent open posterior fontanelle. No thyroid tissue was identified by ultrasound. The infant was treated with intravenous thyroxin.19 The second patient developed NEC at the age of 6 weeks, 10 days after Nissen funduplication for severe gastro-esophageal reflux. Prior history included hypoxic\u2013ischemic encephalopathy with seizures within the first 24 hours, treated with anticonvulsants. Thyroxin was commenced at age 17 days. Investigation confirmed thyroid dysmorphogenesis. Both infants were diagnosed by the newborn screening test,3 as was the case presented in our study. A pathogenic relationship between hypothyroidism and NEC has been suggested. Thyroid hormone deficiency causes decreased gut motility due to peripheral neuropathy of the intestine. In the presence of feeding, this may allow for intestinal bacterial overgrowth, increased gas production and abdominal distension. A second factor relating the hypothyroid state with NEC is the hemo-dynamic effect of thyroid hormone deficiency. In the fetal and perinatal periods, the thyroid hormone is required for normal increase in cardiac output in response to catecholamines. An unsatisfactory increase in cardiac output in response to stress may lead to decreased mesenteric blood flow and bowel ischemia.19",

Most neonatologists increase feeding volumes gradually in preterm infants, although this is usually not the case for full-term infants.
