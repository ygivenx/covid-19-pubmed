Until recently, it was considered to be either community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or hospital-(and/or ventilator) acquired pneumonia (HAP/VAP). It was noted that there is a subgroup of outpatients who have had contact with the healthcare system and who present with pneumonias caused by organisms more similar to those causing HAP than CAP [1]. A new category of pneumonia called healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was defined [2]. However, recent data have raised questions about whether the concerns regarding the types of pathogens and their resistance patterns in HCAP will in fact hold up [3,4]. It is likely that this subgroup will be modified considerably.",

Typically, about 80% of these cases are treated as outpatients and 20\u201325% in the hospital setting. The overall mortality rate for outpatient CAP is in the region of 1%, but for those ill enough to require hospitalization 30-day mortality rates up to 23% have been reported. Incidence rates are greatest at the extremes of age with an overall rate in adults in the USA of 5.16\u20136.11 cases per 1000 persons per year but being as high as 12\u201318 per 1000 among children <4 years and 20 per 1000 among those over 60 years [6].",

Anaerobic bacteria may be seen in cases of gross aspiration pneumonia in patients with unprotected airways (seizure, substance or alcohol abuse) and/or gingivitis. It is worth noting that S. pneumoniae seems to be decreasing in frequency with widespread use of pneumococcal vaccines and the atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are becoming more important particularly in young adults [13]. Other atypicals such as Legionella and a variety of viral pathogens can play a role as well. Generally, fungal and protozoal infections are not usually seen in the normal host with CAP except under specific circumstances such as coccidioidomycosis and cryptococcosis. PCR studies show that viral pathogens may be present in 20% of CAP patients, but whether they are etiologic agents, co-pathogens or simply colonizers cannot always be determined [14]. A discussion of individual pathogens is beyond the scope of this article.",

It is important to realize that pneumonia is certainly not the old man\u2019s friend. It has been shown that for elderly CAP patients requiring hospitalization the overall mortality rate is greater than that of the general hospital population and this enhanced mortality extends out to 1 year [17]. It is thought that this may be at least partially explained by an increase in vascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke possibly as a result of an overall enhancement of the systemic inflammatory response in such patients [18].",

Direct inoculation might occur with a penetrating thoracic injury or spread from a contiguous focus of infection such as mediastinitis may occur but both are very unusual. Hematogenous spread in cases of tricuspid endocarditis might be seen in iv drug abusers. The most likely routes, however, are by small volume aspiration of bacteria in the patient\u2019s oropharynx as can occur during sleep and by inhalation of contaminated droplets.

They are felt to take part in innate immunity, they can clear apoptotic cells and can bind non-self structures such as bacteria and fungi [20,21]. If these defenses are also unsuccessful and the infection challenge persists then the inflammatory response of the patient comes into play and accounts ultimately for most of the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. If the pro-inflammatory cytokine response is excessive then the process may progress to sepsis, organ failure and possibly shock and even death. In cases of severe infection, various inflammatory mediators including IL-1, TNF, IL-8 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor result in fever and the release of neutrophils and their attraction to the lung. An alveolar-capillary leak may develop resulting in filling of the alveoli and subsequent hypoxemia and findings of pneumonia on auscultation and on chest x-ray. If this process is severe, the secondary changes in lung volume and compliance may eventually result in the patient\u2019s demise [22,23].",
