Lateral flow immunoassays\n(LFIAs), which are single-channel microfluidic paper devices that\ndetect a pathogen antigen or host antibody response, have miniaturized,\nautomated, and simplified much of the diagnostic process necessary\nfor bacterial and viral pathogen detection.4 The low-cost, long-term stability, and ease-of-use of LFIAs make\nthem advantageous in low-resource settings.5,6 However,\nLFIAs have limited sensitivity and POC accessibility due to the inability\nto easily perform signal enhancement via multistep assays. This is\nbecause the one-dimensional flow from a single sample pad in LFIAs\ndictates that the user manually pipettes each fluid sequentially at\nprecisely timed intervals. The need to perform more complex reactions\nhas given rise to two-dimensional paper networks (2DPNs), which typically\nconsist of more than one fluidic input and multiple carefully designed\nchannels to control fluid flow in the paper-based device.5,6 2DPNs have shown potential for conducting multistep assays in the\npaper, such as amplifying nucleic acids,7 detecting more than one target of interest,8 or enhancing the visual signal at the detection zone compared to\nLFIA alone.9",

We improved upon previous 2DPN designs\nthat use DAB as a signal enhancer by reducing the number of fluidic\ninputs and detection time and by incorporating dry storage of all\nnecessary reagents, including a source for reactive hydrogen peroxide.\nOur fully dried device has shown versatility in the ability to detect\nmultiple types of nucleic acid samples, including PNA products from\na room-temperature RNA amplification reaction, TARA. The applicability\nof this 2DPN can be extended to detect a variety of pathogens and\nincorporate other amplification reactions with FITC and biotin-tagged\nproducts. The HRP signal enhancement retains activity after 28 days\nof dry storage on a fully assembled device. The fully dried and assembled\ndevice (after a total of 60 min run time) achieved a LOD of 5 \u00d7\n1011 copies of ssDNA per mL, comparable to other hybridization-based\nnucleic acid detection devices. When combined with TARA, the LOD can\nreach as low as 5 \u00d7 109 target copies/mL and can be\nfurther reduced by using other NA amplification methods with higher\noutputs. The signal in the detection zone is maintained well after\nthe sample is run, reducing the need for the strictly timed reading\nof results.",

We determined not only the increase in signal intensity\nbut also how that increase affects the true LOD (in copies/mL), a\npractice we believe should be applied to the design of all LFIAs incorporating\nsignal enhancement agents. This proof-of-concept for a fully dried,\ndeployable 2DPN shows promise for detecting many other pathogens beyond\nMers-CoV and can be employed with other nucleic acid amplification\ntechniques.

Capillary pressure\n(Pc) in a rectangular channel is described\nby the equationwhere \u03b3 is the surface tension,\n\u03b8i is the contact angle of fluid\non each i surface, h is the height\nof the membrane,\nand w is the width of the membrane.28 If we assume a rectangular cross-section of nitrocellulose\nand that particles are diluted in water, then Pc = \u03b3(2 cos (\u03b8)/h + 2 cos (\u03b8)/w), where every\nsurface i is nitrocellulose and \u03b8 is the advancing\ncontact angle of pure water on nitrocellulose. Given that our nitrocellulose\nmembrane, FF80HP (GE Healthcare), has pore size comparable to HF135\n(Millipore),21 which can pass particles\nof up to 0.5 \u03bcm,29 we can assume\nan approximate pore size of 0.5 \u03bcm. For water on 0.45 \u03bcm\npore size nitrocellulose, the advancing contact angle is measured\nto be approximately 40\u00b0.30 The capillary\nforce is then equal to Fcap = Pc \u00d7 hw. Substituting in\nthe expression for Pc, the equation becomes Fcap = \u03b32 cos (\u03b8) (w + h). Due to the low Reynold\u2019s\nnumbers in small capillary channels, the inertial effects can be neglected,\nand the capillary force can be equated to the drag force Fdrag = 6\u03bcVzC,27 where \u03bc is the viscosity of the fluid, V is the velocity, z is the distance traveled in\nthe capillary channel, and C is the geometric constant: C = 2h/w + w/h. Then, 6\u03bcVzC = \u03b32 cos (\u03b8)\n(w + h). Then, rearranging to solve\nfor velocity gives1where nitrocellulose width (w) and height (h) are maintained and k is defined as \u03b3/\u03bc\nand is determined experimentally for\nDAB and AuNP solutions.",

This results in a single PNA strand with\nboth markers (Figure S2). PNA probes to\ndetect the nucleocapsid gene of MERS-CoV were designed using the Applied\nBiosystems Primer Express v2 software (structure and sequence details\nshown in Figure S3 and Table S2). Probe\nhybridization sequences were evaluated by the Basic Local Alignment\nSearch Tool (BLAST) to select regions conserved across multiple transcript\nvariants. For the initial design, target complexity and accessibility\nwere evaluated using Visual OMP (DNA Software Inc., Ann Arbor, MI).\nPNAs were synthesized by PNAbio Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA). ssRNA at\nan initial concentration of 2.0 \u00d7 1011 copies/mL was\npurchased from IDT. TARA was performed with the ssRNA at room temperature\nfor 15 min. Dilutions of final TARA products were made in PBST and\napplied directly to sample pads on 2DPNs that had been dried and assembled\nwithin the previous 7 days. The same diluted sample was used for all\n2DPN tests. Replicates were performed simultaneously.",
