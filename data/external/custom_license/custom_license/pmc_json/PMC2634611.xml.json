DMU 452 is the historic core bovine TB\u2013endemic area and remains a focal site of intensive sampling of hunter-killed deer (18). Prior carnivore surveillance conducted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) had detected M. bovis in 18 of 249 sampled coyotes. Given the history of intensive surveillance and elevated M. bovis prevalence in the area, it was the logical choice to implement and evaluate a sentinel-based surveillance program. Habitat associations within DMU 452 were diverse; moraine uplands were dominated by forests of jack pine (Pinus banksiana), white pine (P. alba), oak (Quercus spp.), and maple (Acer spp.). Dominant lowland vegetation included tag alder (Alnus rugosa) and white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), and wetland ephemera were common. Annual precipitation typically ranged from 71 cm to 91 cm; most occurred as snowfall (19). Mean yearly summer and winter temperatures were 21\u00b0C and \u201310\u00b0C, respectively (19).",

We trapped coyotes in 6 townships in Alcona County, 5 in Oscoda County, 2 in Montmorency County, and 2 in Alpena County. Because a large proportion of land in the study area was privately owned (e.g., commercial hunting clubs, agricultural operations, residential development), landowner permission to access property dictated trap placement. Thus, we were unable to randomize trapping locations or distribute traps proportionally among counties. Within each township, traps were checked daily, and trapping was terminated when 10 coyotes were collected. Because multiple captures could occur on the final day of trapping, we occasionally collected >10 coyotes/township. We killed trapped coyotes with a 0.22-caliber gunshot to the brain, determined their age on the basis of tooth wear and eruption (20), and performed necropsy examinations on them within an hour of death to minimize autolysis. Tissues containing visible lesions as well as the parotid, mandibular, retropharyngeal, bronchial, mediastinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected and submitted in formalin for histologic examination and fresh for mycobacterial culture.",

Fresh tissues for bacterial culture were digested and decontaminated with a sodium-hypochlorite-sodium hydroxide method (21). We then spun tissue suspensions in a refrigerated centrifuge at 6,000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes (21). Half of the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended and swabbed on the following solid media: Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing sodium pyruvate (National Veterinary Services Laboratory [NVSL], Ames, IA, USA), Middlebrook 7H11 agar containing sodium pyruvate (NVSL), BBL Mycobactosel L-J medium slant (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, NJ, USA) and Middlebrook 7H11 with aspartic acid and pyruvate (Becton Dickinson) (22). We then injected the suspension (0.5 mL) into BACTEC 12 B liquid culture vials (Becton Dickinson) and BACTEC MGIT liquid culture tubes (Becton Dickinson) (21). The solid media tubes were incubated at 37 \u00b1 2\u00b0C in a 10% CO2 incubator and examined weekly until colonies were observed or until an incubation period of 8 weeks was complete, at which time tubes with no growth were discarded (21). We incubated the BACTEC 12 B vials at 37 \u00b1 2\u00b0C and monitored them in the BACTEC 460 instrument for 6 weeks (21,22). We incubated MGIT 960 tubes at 37 \u00b1 2\u00b0C and monitored them in the BACTEC MGIT 960 instrument for 6 weeks (21\u201323). Colonies from solid media and liquid culture bottles that showed positive signals were confirmed as M. tuberculosis complex identification by a combination of Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining and the AccuProbe M. tuberculosis complex nucleic acid probes (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) (21,23). We then used niacin and nitrate biochemical tests to distinguish M. bovis from M. tuberculosis isolates (21,23).",

When tissues were identified as having granulomatous lesions and acid-fast bacilli, they were further evaluated by PCR. The PCR was performed on the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by using primers for IS6110 to identify M. tuberculosis complex species, which include M. bovis, and 16S rRNA to identify M. avium complex species. The PCR procedures were similar to those described previously (22). Animals were considered positive if bacterial cultures isolated M. bovis from fresh tissues and/or fixed tissues had granulomatous lesions with acid-fast bacilli that were PCR positive for IS6110.

Mean apparent prevalence was significantly greater in coyotes than in deer (Mann-Whitney U4,4 = 14, p<0.001); this overall trend was consistent for all 4 counties. The proportion of M. bovis\u2013positive deer sampled from DMU 452 during 2004\u20132005 fell within 95% confidence limits generated by calculating the proportion of positive deer from 1996 through 2003.",

This finding is critically important as to whether focal species are considered effectual disease sentinels (28) because age- or sex-biased dispersal can severely confound attempts to correlate the spatial distribution of disease occurrence between the sentinel and host. Capture biases in wildlife studies can be a legitimate concern, particularly where complex social behavior, such as agonism, can differentially influence the vulnerability of animals to various methods of capture. Our decision to collect coyotes exclusively by means of foot-hold traps, rather than hunting with dogs or with predator calls (the methods preferred by sport hunters), should have minimized sampling bias: socially dominant individual animals are potentially more susceptible to predator calls (29). Furthermore, standardizing sampling effort to a single trapping period with a goal of 10 animals/transect should have ensured that the animals that were captured, and their disease status, were representative of the at-large population (30).",

However, TB is a chronic infection, and animals usually survive in relatively good condition until severe clinical symptoms, such as extreme malaise (8), appear at the penultimate stage of disease (9). Because of this, there is a relatively short temporal frame (\u22482 weeks) between the onset of moribund condition and death (9) when capture probabilities may be biased by disease status. We found no evidence of physical debilitation positively or negatively influencing capture probability. Of 58 M. bovis\u2013positive coyotes captured, none showed symptoms of severe emaciation or lethargy suggestive of advanced disease, and only 1 coyote bore widely disseminated lesions visible on gross inspection during necropsy. Thus, we believe our trap-transect method of sampling coyotes was robust to potential bias associated with coyote disease status. Because the animals were euthanized upon capture, our work was not replicable. Therefore, we could not use a design based on mark-recapture to determine if, in fact, our sampling protocol produced stable, increasing, or diminishing prevalence estimates over successive trapping sessions.",

Lesions ranged from acute to chronic; marked fibrosis and few acid-fast organisms were noted in the chronic lesions. Only 1 animal had evidence of advanced disease, as evidenced by lesions in the lung and liver, which may have been caused by a large infectious dose, a compromised immune system, or long-term infection. The spectrum and locations of lesions led us to postulate that coyotes may acquire M. bovis orally and have the immunologic ability to minimize and possibly eliminate the bacteria. Our study was not designed to determine route of transmission or whether coyotes were a maintenance reservoir for M. bovis. However, preliminary results of current research indicate that excretion of M. bovis by coyotes experimentally inoculated with oral doses (ranging from 10 to 105 CFU) is probably unlikely or undetectable (M. Dunbar, National Wildlife Research Center, pers. comm.). If excretion of M. bovis is not likely in orally inoculated coyotes, then it is not likely to result in widespread infection among coyotes that would have become infected by ingesting infected tissue. Moreover, the absence of M. bovis in control coyotes sampled from the Upper Peninsula, where bovine TB has not been detected in white-tailed deer or cattle (12), lends further credence to the belief that coyotes are spillover rather than maintenance hosts.",

However, in areas where livestock densities are low, M. bovis prevalence in wildlife must be surveyed directly (13). The disparity in prevalence relative to sampling effort between coyotes and deer is strong evidence that coyotes could be useful for monitoring M. bovis occurrence in Michigan (4). Coyotes in Michigan generally have larger home ranges than deer (coyotes, statistical mean 14.25 km2; white-tailed deer, statistical mean 2.11 km2; 17,35) and appear to have a much higher per capita probability of developing detectable infection. However, because of discrepant home-range sizes, attempts to spatially correlate sources of infection for coyotes, sympatric wildlife, and domestic livestock will be confounded by spatial scale. Thus, some question about the source of infection in coyotes will always remain; the presence of an infected coyote can only provide a broad indication of the location of the original source of infection. Although we noted that 44% of all M. bovis\u2013positive coyotes were trapped within the boundaries of private hunt clubs, we cannot infer that coyotes acquired the pathogen within club boundaries. The only way to circumvent this inferential deficit is to gather spatial information on a large sample of animals before killing them to determine their infection status (13) and then to develop probabilistic resource selection models (36).",

Their results could have occurred because prevalence rates in cervids were so low that they were not detected, given the number of coyotes sampled; coyotes are not the appropriate sentinel species; or both. Just as it is useful to determine why coyotes can function well as sentinels in Michigan, it is valuable to point out why the same does not appear so in Manitoba. We concur with the authors of the Manitoba study (37) that their negative results could be due to 1) the fact that it was unknown if trapped coyote ranges overlapped cervid ranges (much less if they overlapped the ranges of potentially infected cervids), 2) too low coyote sample size relative to prevalence rate in cervids, and 3) coyotes not being likely to prey on elk (Cervus elaphus); if they scavenge kills of other predators (wolves [Canis lupus], black bears [Ursus americanus]; which may be appropriate sentinels in Manitoba), infected tissues are likely no longer present (38). Other reasons for their negative results could include the following: 1) ranges and diets of coyotes in the area were unknown, 2) the prevalence rate for cervids during the life of most coyotes collected was unknown and likely very low (<0.1%), and 3) if sample quality from carcasses salvaged from trappers or collected opportunistically was compromised, it could negatively affect the ability to detect M. bovis.",

Sentinel coyote surveys appear to be effectual cost- and labor-sensitive indicators of M. bovis presence in sympatric wildlife and domestic livestock. We concur with others (1,28) who endorse the use of sentinel-based surveillance programs, particularly when project goals include monitoring spatiotemporal changes in disease risk. In addition, we believe sentinel-based programs could facilitate adaptive monitoring of disease occurrence where the likelihood of horizontal transmission is great and/or spatial epidemiology is uncertain. From another perspective (39), we also believe that wildlife can serve as effective biologic sensors and satellites of some infectious disease epidemics and bioterrorism that threaten human health and safety.",
