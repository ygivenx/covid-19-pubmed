About 20\u201330% of untreated children with KD exhibit coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, which may lead to myocardial infarction, sudden death, or ischemic heart disease [1, 2]. In developed countries, the incidence of KD has replaced acute rheumatic fever as the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children [1]. Whereas many infectious agents have been postulated as possible causes of KD, no single agent has been shown definitely to be associated with this disease. This report describes a patient with the diagnostic criteria of atypical KD during concomitant cytomegalovirus infection (CMV) infection, and we discuss the possible role of this virus in the etiology of KD.",

On the third day, when coronary artery dilatation and pericardial effusion were detected on echocardiography, KD was suspected. After high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin infusion (IVIG 2 g/kg), acetylsalicylic acid treatment (100 mg/kg/d) was initiated. A dramatic response to the IVIG transfusion was observed on the same day, and her body temperature decreased to within the normal range.

There is no specific diagnostic assay for KD; diagnosis is based on clinical criteria that include fever, bilateral non-exudative conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, polymorphous rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, and changes of the peripheral extremities [1]. A fever of at least 5 days duration and the presence of at least four of the clinical criteria previously cited are sufficient for diagnosis [1]. Under some clinical conditions, the diagnosis of KD may be difficult to make, and a high index of suspicion by the clinician is required. The clinical features of KD may not all be present at the same time, and many clinical findings of KD may be present in other illnesses. These conditions may lead to a misdiagnosis of KD [1, 2].",

These patients were diagnosed as having incomplete or atypical KD, which refers to children presenting with either a fever characteristic of KD but with less than four classical signs of that disease or fever with accompanying coronary artery abnormalities on echocardiography [2, 3]. Atypical KD patients, who are often younger than 1 year, usually have an incorrect initial diagnosis because they exhibit few early signs of KD. Atypical KD is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery abnormalities. KD-related morbidity and mortality rates are high in this patient group [2, 3]. Therefore, KD should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of every child with fever of unknown origin, especially in children younger than 1 year. Our patient presented with four clinical criteria of KD (fever, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, and rash) and coronary artery dilatation. Atypical KD was considered as the result of clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic findings.",

            "text": "The prevalence of CMV infection is greater in developing countries [6]. It has been suggested that 75% of primary CMV infections in pediatric patients occur during the first year of life [7]. Recent studies have implicated CMV in the development of some vascular diseases including atherosclerosis and vasculitis in children and adults [8\u201310]. In an experimental study by Rachel, mice were infected intraperitoneally with CMV and cytomegalic inclusion bodies were seen within cells in the aortic media; CMV antigens were detected in the affected aortas immunohistochemistry. They concluded that CMV might be a cause of aortic inflammation in mice, and that great vessels are the possible targets for CMV [11]. Meyer et al. [5] have described a patient with an active CMV infection and systemic necrotizing vasculitis. After a biopsy finding of a necrotizing vasculitis, they detected positive serologic tests (i.e., CMV IgM, IgG) and CMV-DNA in the sputum by PCR. Ganciclovir and CMV immunoglobulin had been added to the treatment regimen along with prednisolone. Two weeks later, CMV-DNA was negative in the sputum by PCR and CRP; ESR had normalized [5]. In other case reports, it has also been demonstrated that CMV may infect vascular endothelial cells, causing local vasculitis of a leukocytoclastic or necrotizing form with fibrinoid necrosis [12, 13]. Aortic arch thrombosis has been defined in a newborn with congenital CMV infection by Lanari et al. [9]. These authors proved CMV infection by means of virus isolation in cell cultures and at the same time, the viral genome was detected in the blood by PCR [9].",
