Serum IgM and IgG antibodies, as measured by flow cytometry on live PfSPZ, increased following immunization, but did not show a clear association with protection from CHMI (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Memory B cells from five protected individuals were immortalized and screened by staining of intact PfSPZ to isolate human monoclonal antibodies against any surface antigen on PfSPZ (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Most of the IgG monoclonal antibodies bound to PfSPZ with high affinity (Fig. 1d,e). Interestingly, in the two donors from whom both PfSPZ-specific IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies were isolated, the IgM antibodies were recovered at much higher numbers (Fig. 1f). The IgM antibodies had fewer, but still substantial, mutations compared to the IgG antibodies, consistent with an origin from IgM memory B cells (Fig. 1g). In particular, the finding of an antibody lineage containing both IgM and IgG members suggests an incomplete switch in this response despite repeated immunization (Supplementary Fig. 1d). These results demonstrate that immunizations with PfSPZ Vaccine induce a robust antibody response that retains a significant IgM component.",

The invasion-inhibitory activity varied among antibodies and was significantly correlated with binding affinity to PfSPZ (Fig. 2b). A subset of antibodies was further tested in an in vivo mouse humanized liver model for their capacity to protect against natural, mosquito bite-transmitted infection by PfSPZ. Some antibodies, such as MGG3, MGG4, MGH2, MGU10 and MGU12, were very potent in reducing liver burden by up to 98.3%, while others, such as MGG8, MGH1, MGH3 and MGU1, were less effective (Fig. 2c). These findings suggest that in vivo neutralizing activity may be related to the fine specificity of the antibodies.",

            "text": "Next, we set out to identify the target antigens of the monoclonal antibodies. Strikingly, although we had used an antigen-agnostic approach to identify antibodies that bound to the PfSPZ surface regardless of specificity, we found that all of the antibodies bound to recombinant PfCSP (Fig. 2d,e), confirming that this is the most immunogenic protein on the PfSPZ surface23\u201325. To understand the basis for effective neutralization, we mapped the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies using synthetic peptides that cover the N-terminus, the NANP repeat region, the N-terminal junction (connecting region between the N-terminal domain and NANP repeats), and the C-terminus of PfCSP. Binding to the classical NANP repeats (NANP18 peptide), the PfCSP C-terminus, recombinant PfCSP or PfSPZ did not correlate with efficacy (Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013d). Interestingly, however, binding to a minimal 15-mer peptide (NPDP15) that covers the junction between the N-terminal domain and the NANP repeats was a shared characteristic of the most potent in vivo neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 2f). These potent antibodies also recognized the NANP18 peptide, suggesting that the capacity to bind both to the NANP repeats and to the N-terminal junction of PfCSP is the main feature of efficient neutralization. Another distinctive characteristic of the most potent antibodies was the common usage of VH3-30 family alleles carrying tryptophan or arginine at position 52 (VH3-30f, here defined as including VH3-30, VH3-30-3, VH3-30-5 and VH3-33 alleles sharing >96% identity) (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 3,4, Supplementary Table 1). Strikingly, VH3-30f was the most common VH gene used by IgM antibodies isolated from donors G and U, with almost 90% of such antibodies carrying W52 or R52 (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Collectively, these data indicate that the most potent antibodies have a dual specificity and share common VH gene usage. Importantly, such antibodies were isolated from four out of five donors, suggesting that these antibodies belong to a public lineage and therefore have the potential to be readily induced by vaccination.",

            "text": "To investigate the influence of somatic mutations on binding of VH3-30f antibodies to PfCSP, we focused on two clonally related and highly mutated antibodies, MGU1 and MGU10 (Fig. 3a). The unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of these antibodies, which carries tryptophan at position 52, was able to bind to PfCSP and PfSPZ with low affinity, while substitution to serine 52, which is commonly found in VH3-30 alleles, resulted in loss of binding (Fig. 3b,c). These findings, in conjunction with the high frequency of W52 in the IgM sequences and the identification of putative VH3-30f alleles carrying W52 in the germline sequences obtained from non-B cells of donors G, U and W (Supplementary Fig. 3,4), identify VH3-30f alleles carrying W52 as a preferred feature for the initiation of this lineage-specific antibody response to PfCSP. The branch point of this clone achieved, through several mutations, high affinity binding to PfSPZ, PfCSP and NANP18, while further mutations in MGU10, but not MGU1, increased breadth by conferring the unique ability to bind to NPDP15 (Fig. 3b\u2013e, Supplementary Fig. 5). Despite their similarities in binding to PfSPZ, PfCSP and NANP18, MGU10 was substantially more potent than MGU1 in the in vivo assay (Fig. 2c), suggesting that acquisition of binding to NPDP15 is the key factor for potent neutralization. Interestingly, mutagenesis studies of MGU10 suggest that W52 remains a critical residue for binding to NPDP15, but becomes dispensable for high affinity binding to NANP and full-length PfCSP in the fully mutated antibody (Fig. 3f). In contrast, in a second clonal family consisting of MGU5 and MGU8, full binding to PfCSP, NANP18, NPDP15 and PfSPZ was already achieved by the branch point while the remaining mutations appeared redundant (Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013e).",

Most UCAs bound to NANP18 but not to NPDP15, suggesting that the antibodies generally started as NANP-specific and gained affinity for NPDP15 through somatic mutations (Supplementary Fig. 6f\u2013m). These data delineate a pathway of antibody development that is dependent on specific VH alleles and leads to antibodies with dual specificity. To identify the minimal residues recognized by antibodies at the PfCSP N-terminal junction, we performed a mutational analysis on NPDP19, a 19-mer version of NPDP15 that was used to provide a longer scaffold for binding (Fig. 3g). The loss of binding to certain peptides identified a specific motif (DPNANP) that was recognized by most antibodies regardless of VH gene usage. These findings, combined with data from peptide array experiments (Supplementary Fig. 7), identify the N-terminal junction binding site of the most potent neutralizing antibodies as including the first unit of the NANP repeat region and flanking non-repeat sequences, providing a molecular basis for the dual specificity of these antibodies.",

Only the C-terminal half (NPDPNAN, residues 7\u201313) of the peptide was visible, with most of the contacts being made by heavy-chain residues as shown by the Fab buried surface area (Fig. 4b). Specifically, the heavy-chain CDR loops form a groove in which the peptide resides (Fig. 4a\nand\nSupplementary Fig. 8a). In addition, three interfacial waters are involved in an extensive hydrogen-bonding network, connecting the side chain of N11 to the base of CDR H1 and CDR H3 (Supplementary Fig. 8b). The CH/\u03c0 interaction between P10 and W52 (Fig. 4a\nand\nSupplementary Fig. 8b) confirms that the latter residue is critical for binding as indicated by the mutagenesis experiments. While most peptide residues, except for N13, display a relatively large buried surface area (Fig. 4c), weak electron density for the residues visible at the peptide\u2019s termini (N7, P8, A12 and N13) (Fig. 4e\nand\nSupplementary Fig. 8c) indicates structural flexibility and highlights the sequence DPN as the principal binding motif. Interestingly, the DPN sequence displays a pseudo 310 turn, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonding of the aspartate side chain to the asparagine backbone amide. Such a conformation is very similar to turns observed for unbound NANP peptides in solution and in crystal structures of free and antibody-bound peptides (Fig. 4d)25\u201329. An isolated DPN motif is also present in the 282\u2013383 C-terminal peptide, which may explain its binding to MGG4 (Fig. 2e), notwithstanding the significant differences between the DPN flanking residues in the 282\u2013383 C-terminal and the N-terminal junctional peptides (NDPNR versus PDPNA, respectively). Binding to both NPDP and NANP repeats suggests that the aspartate residue in the DPN motif is interchangeable with an asparagine. Binding studies of MGG4 to NPDP19 peptide mutants validate the specificity of MGG4 toward DPN and NPN motifs (Fig. 3g). Only when the central DPN and NPN motifs within the NPDP19 peptide are mutated to DPA and AAN is MGG4 binding completely abrogated. In contrast, a third DPN motif present at the C-terminus of the NPDP19 peptide does not contribute to binding, possibly indicating the importance of flanking residues for optimal binding. Overall, these data imply that potential peptide-binding promiscuity allows MGG4 to bind to diverse epitopes on PfCSP. Since other VH3-30f antibodies cannot bind to the 282\u2013383 peptide, we expect that they will be less promiscuous and bind slightly larger or more specific sequences.",

In an initial attempt to investigate whether the NPDP19 peptide might be sufficient to induce a protective response, we immunized BALB/c mice with NPDP19 conjugated to KLH. All mice produced IgG antibodies that were specific for the NPDP19 peptide, but were at best weakly reactive for the NANP18 peptide (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). Strikingly, in spite of their ability to bind to PfSPZ, the mouse sera were unable to inhibit PfSPZ invasion of a hepatocyte cell line in vitro, suggesting that dual specificity for NANP and the N-terminal junction may be required for potent neutralizing function (Supplementary Fig. 9c,d). The reliance of the dual-specific antibodies that we isolated on specific human VH3-30f alleles suggests that mice, which do not have the counterparts of human VH3-30f genes, may not be the most suitable model organism to test a novel CSP-based vaccine. Rather, an organism such as the Aotus monkey, which has a more similar VH gene repertoire to humans and contains VH3-30f-like genes carrying the equivalent of W5230, may be a more suitable choice.",

Strikingly, all of the IgG antibodies that we identified recognized PfCSP, consistent with previous studies describing the immunodominance of this protein and its abundance on the PfSPZ surface23\u201325,33,34. Our findings are in agreement with previous work that separately describes the importance of the PfCSP NANP repeat region and of the N-terminus23,35\u201337, but, importantly, highlight the fact that antibodies that target epitopes in both regions simultaneously are more potent than antibodies that exclusively recognize each individual site. Interestingly, the structural analysis and peptide mutational data indicate that these antibodies, which are originally specific for NANP motifs, do not acquire a completely unrelated specificity, but rather gain promiscuity for sequences centred on a DPN motif. This dual specificity is to a large extent encoded by VH3-30f alleles, but also requires extensive somatic mutations. The importance of dual specificity is highlighted by the fact that immunization with a single NPDP19 peptide is not sufficient to confer protection despite eliciting PfSPZ-binding antibodies.",

The trial was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practices and the protocol was approved by Institutional Review Board of the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI-IRB) (Ref. No. IHI/IRB/No:02-2014), the National Institute for Medical Research Tanzania (NIMR/HR/R.8a/Vol.IX/1691) and the Ethikkommission Basel (EKNZ), Basel, Switzerland (reference number 261/13). The protocol was approved by the Tanzania Food and Drug Authority (TFDA) (Ref. No. TFDA13/CTR/0003), registered at Clinical Trials.gov (NCT02132299) and conducted under U.S. FDA IND 14826. Detailed information on the study procedures of the trial are given in Jongo et al. 2017 (manuscript submitted). Briefly, healthy male volunteers aged 20\u201330 years were randomized to direct venous inoculation (DVI) of 5 doses of normal saline or 1.35 \u00d7 105 or 2.7 \u00d7 105 PfSPZ of the Sanaria\u00ae PfSPZ Vaccine. Vaccine efficacy was assessed by homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by DVI inoculation of 3,200 infectious PfSPZ Challenge, at 3 and 24 weeks after the last PfSPZ vaccination.",

HBS was also used as running buffer. An irrelevant biotinylated 19-mer peptide was used as a control for non-specific interactions. A NeutrAvidin-immobilized NLC ProteOn sensor chip (Biorad) was pre-conditioned with an NaCl solution (1 M) and the biotinylated peptides were injected onto the chip. The monoclonal antibodies were diluted and titrated in HBS (50-16.7-5.6-1.9-0.6 nM) and injected onto chip; one channel of the chip was injected with HBS and used as reference for the analysis. All injections were made at a flow rate of 100 \u03bcl/min. Injection time and dissociation time were 240 s and 900 s, respectively. Each binding interaction of the monoclonal antibodies with the biotinylated peptides was assessed using a ProteON XPR36 instrument (Biorad) and data were processed with ProteOn Manager Software (version 3.1.0.6).
