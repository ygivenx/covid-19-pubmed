Substitution at position 31 (S31N) in M2 protein was the most commonly observed substitution with 16 of the 17 isolate having this mutation, whereas only one isolate had V27A change. Emergence of resistance in LBM isolates of AIVs is a rare occurrence. In the only previous study, Lee et al.\n\n42\n reported on detection of resistant isolates from live poultry market and wild birds. High prevalence of S31N substitution in this study is in line with those observed earlier, as this substitution is considered to be the most common mutation conferring resistance to adamentanes\n20\n, whereas V27A mutation is rare in frequency (1\u00b76%). High susceptibility of wild bird isolates to adamantanes is not surprising as these isolates in the avian niche do not experience a selective pressure because of drug use. These antiviral drugs are exclusively used to treat human infections, and the frequency of spontaneous mutations leading to resistance against these drugs is likely very low. However, detection of resistant isolates from LBMs shows possibility of de novo substitution leading to the emergence of resistant AIV strains. These results suggest that adamantine resistance arises as independent point mutations rather than re\u2010assortment or co\u2010variation. This highlights the need to routinely screen M\u2010gene sequences of AIVs to understand the frequency of naturally occurring mutations which might confer resistance to adamantanes.",
