Clinical symptoms were initially observed in 3 miniature pinschers (45 days of age) and 1 cocker spaniel (53 days of age) and consisted of fever (39.5\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C), lethargy, inappetence, vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and neurologic signs (ataxia, seizures) with death after 2 days. The same symptoms were observed 3\u20134 days later in 2 other miniature pinschers (45 days of age) and 1 Pekinese (56 days of age). Necropsy of the dogs showed hemorrhagic enteritis, abundant serosanguineous fluid in the abdominal cavity, and severe lesions in the parenchymatous organs. The lungs had multiple, patchy, red areas of consolidation. Livers were yellow-brown and congested, with hemorrhages on their surfaces, and spleens were enlarged with subcapsular hemorrhages. Variable gross changes in other organs included multifocal hemorrhagic renal cortical infarcts and petechial hemorrhages on lymph node surfaces.",

The S protein of strain CB/05 had the highest identity to FCoV type II strain 79-1683 (Figure 2). Comparison with strain CB/05 was possible only with CCoV type II strains Insavc-1 (10) and BGF (11) and CCoV type I strains Elmo/02 and 23/03 (3,12) because of a lack of data on the 3\u00b4 end of the CCoV genome in the genes encoding for nonstructural proteins (NSPs) 3a, 3b, 3c, 7a, and 7b. NSPs 3a, 7a, and 7b were not altered. NSP 3b (22 aa) was 49 aa shorter than expected because of a 38-nucleotide deletion and a frame shift mutation in the downstream sequence that introduced an early stop codon. NSP 3c (244 aa) was 6 aa shorter and 79 aa longer than the cognate proteins of the enteropathogen strain BGF and the attenuated strain Insavc-1a, respectively.",

Accordingly, the appearance of pathogenic CCoV variants should always be regarded as a potential threat to domestic dogs and considered when unexplainable fatal disease outbreaks occur in puppies.",
