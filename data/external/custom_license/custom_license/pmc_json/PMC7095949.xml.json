Although similar in some ways to ACE, ACE2 functions by removing a single phenylalanine from the amino acid chain, converting angiotensin II to angiotensin1\u20137. Angiotensin1\u20137 has opposing functions to angiotensin II, acting as a potent vasodilator and repressor of cardiac growth7. ACE2 has also been found to hydrolyze peptides outside of the renin-antiotensin system, including dynorphin A (1-13), apelin-13 and des-Arg(9) bradykinin, but the exact functional role of ACE2 in these peptide systems has yet to be revealed.",

It is believed that angiotensin II binding to AT1aR will stimulate lung injury, whereas binding to AT2R reduces lung injury. Kuba et al.4 propose that binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2 downregulates ACE2, thus leaving angiotensin II unmodified, allowing it to continue to bind to the AT1aR to aggravate the lung injury and produce lung edema (Fig. 1). Whether other ACE2 products and their receptors are involved in SARS remains to be determined.",

Furthermore, the newly discovered coronavirus NL63 also binds to ACE213\u2014but unlike SARS-CoV, the NL63 coronavirus is a ubiquitous human pathogen and is not generally associated with ARDS or DAD. The use of ACE2 as a viral receptor of itself therefore does not invariably result in aggravating acute lung injury, leading to DAD.
