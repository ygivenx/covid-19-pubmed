Furthermore, the compound has multiple biological activities\nthat could have value in other therapeutic areas.2,13 Triptolide\nwas reported to stimulate polycystin-2 channel opening, thereby restoring\ncalcium signaling and resulting in attenuation of cyst formation in\na mouse model of polycystic kidney disease.14 It is also known for its reversible male antifertility effects.15 In addition, triptolide was shown to preserve\ncognitive function in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease.16,17 The anticancer and other activities of triptolide\nsuch as its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties are\nmore thoroughly described in recent reviews.18,5,9 Recent studies focus on the development\nof triptolide and its derivatives as potential antileukemic19 and antineoplastic agents.54,223",

However, pH adjustment is not a viable\napproach to increase the solubility of molecules such as triptolide\nthat lack ionizable groups. For such compounds, various strategies\nincluding the use of cosolvents, surfactants, and complexing agents\n(for example, parenterally safe cyclodextrins) have been used to overcome\naqueous solubility limitations. However, some of these techniques\ncan contribute significantly to toxicity. Ideally phosphonooxymethyl\nprodrugs will have good water solubility, particularly at physiological\npH. Avoiding pH extremes and/or cosolvent addition could allow for\nrapid parenteral infusion without the risk of drug precipitation.\nUsing HPLC, the aqueous solubility (buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris at\nroom temperature) of triptolide was determined to be 17 \u03bcg/mL\nwhile that of 4 was 61 mg/mL. Thus, by prodrug formation,\nthe solubility was enhanced 3600 times. We also estimated the second\ndissociation constant (pKa2) of 4. In solution, depending on the pH, the prodrug would exist\nin its diacidic, monobasic, or dibasic states as represented in Scheme 3. The pKa1 has limited pharmaceutical relevance, because the pH\nof most physiologically acceptable solutions would ensure ionization\nof the diacidic species. However, the pKa2 is significant given its influence on aqueous solubility, chemical\nstability, and effectiveness as an enzyme substrate to ensure bioconversion.\nTherefore, within the pharmaceutically relevant pH range, 4 would exist in an equilibrium between its monobasic and dibasic\nspecies. Thus, titration of an equilibrium mixture of these two species\nprovides an acid ionization constant, pKa2, whose value corresponds to the inflection point. Estimation of\nthis pKa2 using 31P NMR is\nadvantageous, as the 31P isotope has high natural abundance\n(100%) and its chemical shift is indicative of the change in ionization\nstate of the phosphorus moiety.46 The 31P NMR spectrum of 4 was obtained as a function\nof pH. The experimental data shown for the change in observed phosphorus\nchemical shifts of 4 in solutions at varying pH (Figure 2) was used to determine\npKa2 (eq 4, experimental part). The pH dependency of this observed\nchemical shift measurement resulted in a sigmoidal curve, which is\ntypical of an acid\u2013base titration. The pKa2 value of 4 was found to be 6.61, which compares\nfavorably to estimates from the literature.47\u221249 At pH 7.4, 4 would exist predominantly as a dianion, thus ensuring high\nsolubility.",

Therefore, prodrugs must be stable in the acidic,\nbasic, and enzymatic conditions of the GI tract for in vivo oral dosing.\nThe excipients in a formulation may also promote prodrug decomposition.\nTherefore, in vitro physiological stability of prodrugs in various\nbuffers (pH 1\u20139) and in simulated gastrointestinal fluids should\nbe assessed to gain insight into the stability of prodrugs. Thus, 4 was incubated with simulated gastric fluid (SGF), simulated\nintestinal fluid (SIF), and various buffers (pH 1\u20139).

The gastric emptying time\nvaries from 0.5\u20131 h in the fasted state to several hours after\na heavy meal. SGF simulates stomach fluid and incorporates acidic\nand enzymatic hydrolysis conditions. SIF mimics the pH and hydrolytic\nenzymes in the intestine. Incubation of 4 in these solutions\nis a rapid way to determine if 4 would be stable under\nconditions found in the GI tract. Compound 4 demonstrated\npH-dependent stability and rapidly degraded with conversion to triptolide\nin simulated gastric fluid and at very low pH values (1\u20132)\nand in simulated gastric fluid whereas it was markedly stable at higher\npH values (3\u20139) and in simulated intestinal fluid (Table 1).
