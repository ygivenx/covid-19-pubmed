            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects 0.5\u20131% of most populations, with a higher propensity in females (Alamanos and Drosos 2005). RA is a multifactorial disease of unknown etiology but with a strong genetic component (Dieude and Cornelis 2005), and recent studies based on various gene-finding strategies have identified the first genes implicated in the susceptibility to RA (Plenge et al. 2007; The Wellcome Trust Consortium 2007; Worthington 2005). However, many susceptibility genes still remain unknown. Among the difficulties involved in gene identification in complex traits are factors such as variable penetrance, variable relative risk associated to the disease allele, epistasis, genetic heterogeneity of the human population, and complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors (Lander and Schork 1994).",

Experimental animal models can be used for gene identification, but more important they allow the functional characterization of arthritis-regulating loci and genes, which consequently could result in the development of novel drugs or targets for human RA. Rat models are particularly useful because large numbers of progeny can be generated from inbred strains that differ in their susceptibility to various arthritis models, including collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), oil-induced arthritis (OIA), and pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) (Holmdahl et al. 2001). To date, linkage analysis studies in rat models of RA have identified more than 20 loci that are either specific for the given animal model or shared with other arthritis models or with RA in humans (Joe 2006).",

Nevertheless, caution should be taken when comparing physiologic, biochemical, or genetic data among studies in which the same strains but from different breeding facilities have been used. In this study we aimed at characterizing the genetic and phenotypic differences between the two most commonly used DA substrains (DA/Ztm and DA/OlaHsd) in arthritis linkage studies. This approach provided additional information and a better understanding of previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) in those strains. Our original colony of inbred DA rats (referred to as DA/ZtmRhd) was established from DA/Ztm breeding pairs and we also used DA rats from Harlan Europe (referred to as DA/OlaHsd).

DA/OlaHsd rats originating from Harlan Europe (Netherlands) were kept and bred as brother-sister matings for more than five generations in the animal facility in Lund in a climate-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles. In the same facility breeding was performed to produce DA.DA/ZtmRhd-Cia11 (\u2265N3) congenic rats. Shortly, one DA/ZtmRhd male and two DA/OlaHsd rats were used to produce the F1 generation. Six F1 females were further backcrossed with DA/OlaHsd male rats. After three to four backcross generations, Cia11 heterozygous rats were then intercrossed and only strictly littermate-controlled experiments were performed to ensure that all phenotypic differences originated exclusively from the genetic differences in the Cia11 region. Rats were housed in polystyrene cages containing wood shavings and fed standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. The rats were free from common pathogens including Sendai virus, Hantaan virus, corona virus, reovirus, cytomegalo virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis.

Arthritis was induced in age- and cage-matched rats at the age of 7\u20139 weeks, and arthritis development was monitored in all four limbs using a macroscopic scoring system. Briefly, one point was given for each swollen and red toe, one point for each affected midfoot, digit, or knuckle, and five points for a swollen ankle (maximum score per limb was 15 and maximum score per rat was 60). The rats were examined in a blinded fashion every second to third day for one month after induction of the disease (Holmdahl 1997).

We therefore performed a whole-genome scan of DA/OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd rats using 248 well-established SSLP markers covering all 20 autosomal chromosomes and the X chromosome and compared the allele sizes in the two substrains. The marker selection was based on previous results from crosses between E3/ZtmRhd and DA/ZtmRhd rats and the E3 strain also was included in the typing as an internal control. As expected, all 248 initially typed markers were found in homozygous form in all three strains and were polymorphic between E3 and DA/ZtmRhd rats. However, we also found markers that differed in allele size between DA/ZtmRhd and DA/OlaHsd rats. As shown in Table 1, 35 of 248 markers were found to be polymorphic between the two DA substrains. This means that calculated on those markers, the two substrains differed in 14.1% of their genome. When analyzing markers from each rat chromosome (RNO) alone, the variability ranges from 0% (RNO7, 9, 15, 16) to 20% (RNO2, 3, 10, 14, 18) and up to 44% (RNO13).

We added additional markers in close proximity to those polymorphic regions. For RNO2, RNO5, RNO10, and RNO13 all additional markers were nonpolymorphic, ruling out the possibility of a large contaminating fragment. However, on RNO3 additional markers were found to be polymorphic, suggesting the presence of a large contaminating fragment in this region. It is well known that SSLP regions exhibit a higher mutation rate than the average genome and, thus, the surprisingly high genetic variability could be the result of mutations in the SSLP regions analyzed. However, it is far more likely that it is the result of contamination of one of the DA substrains with another rat strain. To support this theory, we took advantage of the recently performed whole-genome typing of 20,238 SNPs in 167 inbred rat strains, including DA/OlaHsd (Saar et al. 2008). Although the DA/ZtmRhd substrain was not among those strains, a relatively closely related substrain, DA/HanKini, was included. By comparing this strain with DA/OlaHsd we found seven distinct clusters of polymorphic SNPs on five rat chromosomes (Table 1). While six of those regions with sizes between 1 and 4 Mb were considerably small, we found one cluster of SNPs on RNO3 that was more that 10 Mb. We conclude that DA/OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd rats differed at a high number of SSLP and at a large contaminating DNA fragment on RNO3.",

We found 13 markers differing between DA/OlaHsd and DA/ZtmRhd, including the original peak marker D3Wox9 of the Cia11 QTL. Most of them were clustered between position 35.9 and 49.0 Mb. To verify that this difference is indeed the result of contamination and not due to randomly occurring mutations in the SSLP regions, we typed four SNP markers. Because at that point of investigation only a limited amount of strains had available SNP information and the DA strain was not included, we chose the SNPs randomly. Two of the tested SNPs were found to be polymorphic between the substrains. To compare the contaminating fragment to other strains, we included DA substrains (DA/Ztm, DA/ZtmKiru, DA/AlbNSI, DA/Hsd) from different breeders as well as other rat inbred strains such as BN, ACI, F344, and LEW.1F. First, DA/Ztm, DA/ZtmRhd, and DA/ZtmKiru rats share the same haplotype on RNO3, confirming the close relationship of these substrains (Supplementary Table 2). At the same time, DA/OlaHsd rats from Harlan Europe share the same haplotype with DA/Hsd rats from Harlan USA and DA/AlbNSI rats from the USA. Second, BN and F344 are highly similar to the DA/ZtmRhd haplotype, whereas ACI is nearly identical to the DA/OlaHsd strain. Analyses of all published SNPs in that locus revealed a 100% identical haplotype of DA/OlaHsd and all substrains of ACI, whereas the DA/HanKini haplotype appeared to be unique. Even so, no conclusion of the origin of the contamination can be drawn at that point and extensive SNP typing will be required to do so. In summary, combination of SSLP analyses and available SNP data conclusively identified a contaminating fragment on RNO3 stretching from 35.6 to 52.3 Mb.\n\n",

Data from the two experiments showed similar results (Table 2) and thus were pooled, revealing a significant difference in arthritis incidence between the two strains (Fig. 2a). Fifty-two of 55 (95%) DA/OlaHsd rats developed arthritis while only 48% (26/54) of DA/ZtmRhd rats developed arthritis (p < 0.0001). In addition, the arthritis severity was significantly reduced in DA/ZtmRhd rats. When all animals were included in the analysis, p < 0.0001 for all scoring days from day 12 to day 21, when the experiment was terminated (Fig. 2b). Because there was such a drastic difference in incidence, we performed the analysis including only affected rats. DA/OlaHsd rats (n = 52) also had a significantly enhanced arthritis severity compared to DA/ZtmRhd rats (n = 26) (Fig. 2c). The p value was less than 0.01 from day 14 to the end of the experiment. However, the day of disease onset was not different between the rat substrains. The low incidence of DA/ZtmRhd was surprising to us because earlier we found that this substrain displayed a 90\u2013100% susceptibility to PIA. However, previous experiments with the DA/ZtmRhd strain induced PIA with a higher dose of pristane (150 \u03bcl). To confirm that the lower incidence seen in DA/ZtmRhd strain in this study was due to the lower amount of pristane injected, we immunized ten DA/ZtmRhd rats with 150 \u03bcl pristane. The result confirmed the data from previous experiments using the DA/ZtmRhd strain; nine of ten rats developed arthritis at day 16 after immunization and the day of onset ranged from day 10 to day 16 (Table 2). In conclusion, we demonstrated that DA/OlaHsd rats were significantly more sensitive to the induction of PIA, which is reflected in the enhanced incidence and severity of arthritis after a single \u201clow-dose\u201d injection of pristane.\n",

In contrast to PIA, the arthritis incidence at the end of the experiment (day 28) was not significantly different between the two DA substrains. Thirty-eight of 39 (97%) DA/OlaHsd rats developed CIA and 95% (37/39) of DA/ZtmRhd rats developed it.

We generated a partly congenic rat line by backcrossing DA/ZtmRhd rats to DA/OlaHsd rats for at least three generations to introduce the DA/ZtmRhd fragment on RNO3 into the DA/OlaHsd background. Despite the genetic and phenotypic differences that we observed between the two DA substrains, both strains displayed a high susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis, which suggested that only a small number of arthritis QTLs differed in these substrains. Thus, we estimated that three backcross generations, a considerably high number of tested animals, and the strict use of littermate controls will be sufficient to investigate the effect of a single locus like the contaminating fragment on RNO3. No difference in arthritis and antibody response between DA.DA/ZtmRhd-Cia11 congenic rats and DA/OlaHsd littermate controls was observed in PIA or CIA (Fig. 4).\n",

In the first study by Griffiths et al. (2000), a F2 hybrid of (DA \u00d7 BN) was used, and it was found that the DA allele from DA/Bkl rats at Cia11 recessively promotes CIA severity. In a different study by Olofsson et al. (2003b), another substrain of DA (DA/ZtmRhd) was used for an F2 backcross with the E3 strain, and in this study the DA allele had a recessive-promoting effect on arthritis severity as well. The Cia11 QTL was found to have a recessive-promoting allele in both DA substrains, but because of their genetic differences on RNO3 between 35.6 and 52.3 Mb we can exclude this region for being responsible for the Cia11 effect. This is confirmed through the comparison of the DA.DA/ZtmRhd-Cia11 congenic rat, which is as susceptible to CIA and PIA as their littermates harboring the DA/OlaHsd allele.",

Bold lines inside the boxes highlight the median value (50th percentile). Lines outside the boxes represent the 10th and 90th percentiles. Outlines (\u00b0) are indicated. DA/OlaHsd (n = 38) had a significantly earlier onset of arthritis than DA/ZtmRhd (n = 37). (d) Anti-CII antibodies in DA substrains after CIA are shown as relative fluorescence units measured in Eu3+LISA. Data are shown as boxplots. DA/OlaHsd rats had significantly higher levels of total anti-CII-IgG, anti-CII-IgG2a, and anti-CII-IgG2b\n",
