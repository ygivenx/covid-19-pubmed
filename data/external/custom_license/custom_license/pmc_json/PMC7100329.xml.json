Uncertainty may prevail among the staff and the patients involved with respect to, for example, the probable causative pathogen (if not yet discovered as such) and the outbreak\u2019s source. Infection control personnel expend a great deal of effort in investigating such outbreaks, which may lead to unexpectedly high costs for the affected hospital [1]. There is also the risk of that the hospital will suffer from a loss of reputation if the outbreak is reported to the community by the public media [2]. Approximately 2\u201310% of all nosocomial infections are acquired during nosocomial outbreaks [3, 4].",

However, collecting large amounts of such data often proves being difficult for several reasons:Identifying relevant articles is generally time-consuming. One of the standard approaches to obtaining relevant information is to search international databases, such as PubMed. A subsequent check of the retrieved abstracts may reveal that many articles are not within the scope of interest. In addition, one single outbreak may be described in multiple publications, or the data from one single outbreak may be fragmented and published in different articles.Search options might be limited. So-called \u201copen access journals\u201d are currently still the minority in the medical literature. The accessibility to other articles typically depends on the type of contract between the library of the institution and the journal\u2019s publishers. This commercial relationship (or lack of it) greatly complicates the retrieval of articles.An outbreak report may have been filed only in a journal that is not listed in the major literature databases. This represents a most severe problem in research on nosocomial outbreaks as all of those articles will be missed by the usual initial search strategy approach.\n",

[18]. Thirty-four outbreaks from 27 articles were examined; the infections included 112 cases of blood stream infections, 61 cases of conjunctivitis, 30 patients suffering from pneumonia, 19 patients with urinary tract infections, 16 cases of meningitis, and seven surgical site infections. Based on their systematic review, Voelz et al. suggest such measures as patient isolation, use of gloves and gowns, enforced hand disinfection, enhanced environmental disinfection measures, and the well thought-out use of antimicrobial substances. Sampling of environmental sites, however, should only be performed as a \u201csecond line measure\u201d in the specific case where the application of the first-mentioned measures fail to control the outbreak.",
