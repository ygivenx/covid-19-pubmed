Recently, two early-onset cortical cerebellar degenerations (CCD) have been described in cats; they were characterized by prominent Purkinje cell degeneration, moderate granule cell number decrease, moderate inferior olive degeneration, and normal pontine nuclei. One of these entities was autosomic recessive [1,6], and the other [22] was of unknown origin. Prominent Purkinje cell decay was reported in three kittens from the United Kingdom [24]. In the latter cases, changes in the medullary nuclei were also noted. A neuroaxonal dystrophy that involved lateral cuneate and olivary nuclei, as well as the dorsal tegmentum beside the cerebellar cortex, has also been reported in kittens [3,25].",

General examination was unremarkable, and blood tests for feline coronavirus antibodies and feline leukemia virus antigen were negative. Cat 1 had a normal gait, whereas cats 2 and 3 exhibited mild cerebellar signs characterized by intention tremors and limb hypermetria. Signs were more obvious in cat 3. Cat 3 underwent head MRI imaging that was normal. Notably, the size of the cerebellum was similar to that of a healthy, age-matched control. At the owners\u2019 request, the three kittens were euthanized, and partial necropsy was allowed. Cat 1 was used as a control, as well as six other kittens, 3\u20136 months of age, which were euthanized for untreatable neurological signs. These controls had meningomyeloencephalitis lesions but no cerebellar degeneration.",

In normal cats, innumerable calbindin-positive axons, coming from the Purkinje cells, run between these neurons and end as large synapses that cover almost 30% of their linear pericaryal surface (Fig. 2e). In the two mutants, the number of calbindin-positive fibers running between the neurons in these nuclei was extremely decreased, and many spheroids were visualized by calbindin (Fig. 2f) and RT97 immunesera. Almost no calbindin-positive synapses were visible on the neuron surface (Fig. 2f). The drop in this synaptic covering was much more dramatic than expected from the Purkinje cell loss.",

Purkinje cells of these mutants acquire normal synapses with afferent and efferent neurons but fail to survive, leaving empty baskets as a track of their previous presence [20]. Among these mice, the \u201cnervous\u201d mutant [17] shares many features with our cats from a neuropathological point of view. Indeed, in the young nervous mice, preferential death of vermis Purkinje cells occurs along longitudinal strips, symmetrical relative to the midline [23]. Degeneration is more prominent in the hemispheres [17], and affected Purkinje cells have axonal torpedoes [16,20]. Regions of preferentially surviving Purkinje cells include the nodulus and the flocculus [23]. Dendritic modifications are also mild, with swellings and slight abnormalities at the branching points [2,16]. Recurrent collaterals are only occasionally encountered in nervous mice [16], and increased density and staining of basket cells terminals are present [2]. In cats as in mice, symmetrical parasagittal stripes of Purkinje cells are characterized by differential protein expressions [18]. A resulting difference of sensitivity to abiotrophic processes has been proposed in mice [23] and could similarly exist in cats.",

This is pathognomonic of the so-called \u201cdying-back\u201d process degenerations [19], as are also the axonal spheroids [8,19], arciform collaterals [19], and increased recurrent plexuses in the granular layer [19].
