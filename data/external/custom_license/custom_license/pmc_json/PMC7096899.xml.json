Nanocapsules are \u201cvesicular systems\u201d in which the drug is located inside of the particle and is usually dissolved in an oily vehicle. Nanospheres are \u201cmatrix-type\u201d systems in which the drug is dispersed homogenously into the constituent material (Olivier 2005) (Fig. 1a). These systems possess characteristics that determine their biological impacts, such as the chemical composition, size of the primary particle, morphology and solubility, among others. The advantages of using these systems is their ability to cross biological barriers and reach the organ, tissue or target cell group, arrive at intracellular compartments and control the release of the active molecule at its action or absorption site, thereby improving problems associated with the solubility, bioavailability, immunocompatibility and cytotoxicity of many drugs (Ramos et al. 2018; Kou et al. 2018; Jabr-Milane et al. 2008). NPDC with pharmaceutical purposes are mainly elaborated with polymers and lipids that are selected as raw material for the elaboration of the latter concern and are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) materials (Irache 2008).",

M\u00faller et al. (2002) reported that although polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) were fabricated with polymers, the organism in vivo did not recognize them as foreign. Thus, PNPs are highly stable solid vectors that tend to encapsulate themselves in the interior of the capsule (Kumari et al. 2010). The development of these systems as a vehicle for active ingredients of natural origin for application in distinct diseases of interest in human and veterinary medicine is a promising field. Active ingredients of natural origin include glycyrrhizinic acid (GA) (Urb\u00e1n 2015), which is a triterpenic saponoin mainly responsible for the pharmacological activity of Glycyrrhiza species (Fig. 1b). In particular, the licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabrata), known as \u201csweet root\u201d, is a legume found in sub-tropical regions that is recognized for its antiviral, antioxidant and antitumor properties, among others (Aguilar-Rosas et al. 2015; Izutani et al. 2014).",

            "text": "The development of novel drug administration systems should maintain a high safety range and permit the cells to monitor the environment and respond to external signals to survive. Vital physiological processes, such as cell division, adhesion, polarity, secretion, migration, changes in shape and ciliary and flagellar movement, are regulated by diverse signaling pathways and are executed through cytoskeletal reorganization (Liu et al. 2013). The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network composed of different proteins. The most predominant protein is actin, which possesses functions related to maintenance of the architecture and structural integrity of the cell; these functions are mainly associated with changes in shape and movement through structures, which is accomplished by filament rearrangements. Thus, the induction of changes in cell form and migration in response to diverse extracellular signals is related to these filaments (Guirado et al. 2002). Actin presents in a globular/monomeric (G-actin) or filamentous/polymeric (F-actin) form. Actin monomers and filaments are attached to an important variety of proteins that regulate and modify their structures and functions. Actin filaments adopt distinct types of arrangements, such as bundles (parallel and contractile) and networks (mesh-like and dendritic). Parallel bundles are formed by actin filaments that are tightly associated and provide support to structures such as filopodia and microvilli. The contractile axes are composed of tightly associated antiparallel bundles of actin filaments and provide support for structures such as myosin (motor protein) that allows displacement of the filaments among them to form contractile structures, such as stress fibers or the muscular sarcomere. The mesh-formed networks comprise intertwined actin filaments and form the support for the laminar part of the lamellipodia. The dendritic networks are composed of actin filaments that polymerize in a branched fashion and are found at the leading edge of the lamellipodia to produce membranous protrusions. The cell cortex is composed of a network of actin filaments bound to a plasma membrane. These actin filaments can be associated with myosin, which affords the cortex the capacity of contraction and tenses the filament network, rendering it more resistant and maintaining cell shape (Hotulainen and Lappalainen 2006; Cooper and Hausman 2009; Alberts 2014; Tojkander et al. 2012).",

Then, two different NPDC were elaborated as the GA transport systems. Once the formulations were obtained, they were incubated with the cultures at concentrations ranging from 1.25 to 100 \u00b5g/ml to determine changes in actin filament structure via a direct fluorescent technique and the integrity of the internal cellular activity through the thiazolyl blue [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], neutral red and acridine orange assays.",

Actin filaments form stress fibers that provide support to the cell and play an important role in mechanotransduction, which is a characteristic of cells that grow in rigid strata. The filaments are visible in MARC-145 cells, where they form radial longitudinal bundles and arcs (Fig. 3a). We observed a lamellipodia with an actin-enriched zone at the leading edge corresponding to a dendritic network (Fig. 3b).

(2003). Viral agents comprise a great challenge to human and animal health. One of the diseases with the greatest negative impact on the porciculture industry is reproductive and respiratory porcine syndrome (PRRS), which has been recognized by the authors including Albina (1997), Tian et al. (2007), Zimmerman et al. (2006) and Dea et al. (2000) as one of the diseases with the greatest negative economic impact worldwide. Kim et al. (1993) and Dea et al. (1995) reported a population derived from the MA-104 African green monkey kidney cell line than was highly permissive for replication of the PRRS virus (i.e., the MARC-145 cell line). Based on the results of the study, the MARC-145 cell line is considered the culture of choice for the replication of this pathogen. Urb\u00e1n et al. (2015) described diminution of the infectivity of the PRRS virus due to treatment with GA in SLN; however, these authors did not conduct studies on the innocuousness of their transport system. The objective of this work was to establish a cellular model that allowed evaluation of the innocuousness of systems to examine the incorporation of drugs of natural origin into nanoparticulate models. These nanotransporters improve pharmacokinetics due to their nanometric sizes, which confer characteristics such as the ability to cross biological barriers and avoid premature degradation of the active ingredient, among other benefits described by authors such as Irache (2008). Not only is the size of the NPDC a desirable characteristic of these systems, but the nature of the materials with which they are elaborated also confer unique properties. SLN represent a good drug delivery system due to their lipophilic nature (Mehnert and M\u00e4der 2001), as do PNPs, which are formed from polymers that are innocuous for living organisms (Escalona and Quintanar 2014).

The pattern of actin in highly confluent cultures manifests predominance at the cell cortex level with stress fibers spreading through the cytoplasm, suggesting important regulation of the cell form and its participation in the formation of cell junctions and focal adhesions as well as participation in signaling pathways (Khatau et al. 2009).",

SLN without the drug were the most cytotoxic system, with very low safety margins (i.e., 5 \u00b5g/ml). The addition of GA raises the dose to a maximal range of 50 \u00b5g/ml at 24 h of exposure as measured by mitochondrial and lysosomal activity; this finding suggests that the lipid concentration is crucial for establishing safety. Additionally, the latter finding indicates that the presence of high lipid contents permits abrupt fusion with the cell membrane, causing severe osmotic disequilibria and cell death, due to induction of actin filament depolymerization, with a resultant loss of stress fiber and the cell cortex structure and subsequent nuclear destruction (Fig. 4). The drug is adsorbed inside the NPDC, where it occupies space in its structure with sufficient effectiveness to diminish the lipid concentration and permit maintenance of the SLN\u2013GA with a tenfold greater safety margin. Therefore, for SLN, the therapeutic margin should be standardized for the transport of other drugs. At doses less than 50 \u00b5g/ml, neither system affects the cellular morphology and actin filament structure. The mitochondrial and lysosomal activities were greater than 80%, suggesting that no cell damage occurred (Fig. 5a, b). For PNPs with and without the drug, there is no evidence of diminution of cell viability under 80% compared to the control within the 100\u20131.25 \u00b5g/ml concentration range. The PNPs nanotransporters exhibited less toxicity, which could be related with their smaller sizes (Fig. 2a). Katsumiti et al. (2015) reported the presence of PPS-dependent cytotoxic effects measured by the MTT and NR assays. Mitochondrial activity results in reduction of methyl tetrazolium into formazan via the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is increased in the presence of SLN. Formazan is a membrane-impermeable compound; thus, it accumulates in the interior of healthy cells and is easily observed by bright-field microscopy (Fig. 5d, e), as reported by authors such as Mossman (1983) and Fotakis and Timbrell (2006). Formazan is a strongly lipophilic substance; therefore, the presence of the needle-shaped crystals of formazan is increased inside cells treated with SLN\u2013GA, suggesting optimal internalization of the nanoparticulate systems, as described by Angius and Floris (2015).",

To evaluate internalization of the NPDC, the cell cultures were acutely exposed to coumarin C6-labeled NPDC for 4 h. We evaluated internalization of NPDC, as well as the actin cytoskeleton and nuclear integrity through fluorescence microscopy. The coumarin C6-conjugated NPDC allowed visualization of the degree of internalization in the cells; thus, internalization of the NPDC conjugated with coumarin C6 could be estimated based on displacement inside the cells by observing the fluorescence emitted by the coumarin C6. Coumarin C6-labeled SLN\u2013GA and PNPs\u2013GA showed fluorescent staining in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 6e, f). The absence of coumarin C6-labeled NPDC throughout the entire existing space among the cells is suggestive of the uptake of the NPDC systems inside the cells. In cells treated with SLN\u2013GA, we observed a predominance of staining that was distributed more profusely in the cytoplasm, and PNPs were observed to a greater degree toward the periphery. NPDC appear to be facilitator systems for the drug, because the detection of coumarin C6-labeled NPDC in the cells revealed a pattern dependent upon the time of exposure. These data were similar to the results observed by Kim et al. (2016), who reported the presence of positive fluorescence in the interior of Caco-2 cells exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled NPDC for 4 h. These results suggest that SLN and PNPs can be employed as GA-supplier systems. In the assay with coumarin C6-labeled NPDC, the drug internalization process did not cause alterations in cellular morphology or in the actin cytoskeleton structure, measured indirectly by coumarin C6 displacement. However, confocal microscopy studies should be conducted to establish a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the cells using distinct optical cuts to determine the exact site where the stain is concentrated.",

Acridine orange staining suggests that polymeric nanoparticles comprise an innocuous system that is superior to lipid nanoparticles at 72 h of exposure under the conditions evaluated in the present investigation. Using assays with coumarin C6-labeled NPDC, we corroborated the internalization of GA transported by the NPDC, which suggested a facilitator role for crossing the cell membrane and internal transport. MARC-145 cells represented a good model for evaluation of the morphological, structural and functional integrity of the cells through the determination of rearrangements and modification in the actin cytoskeleton and internal cell activity, the latter with the aim of assessing the effects induced by the NPDC. The results will be highly useful for later works evaluating the antiviral effects of GA transported by NPDC.",
