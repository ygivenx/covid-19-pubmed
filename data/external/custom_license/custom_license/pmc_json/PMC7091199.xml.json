First strand cDNA synthesis from extracted RNA was done using The revertAid\u2122 Minus first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then PCR was performed with primers for amplification of M gene, hMPV- MF1 (AAGTGAATGCATCAGCCCAAG) and hMPV- MR1 (CACAGACTGTGAGTTTGTCAAA), which amplified the region between nucleotides 212 and 331, were used to give an amplicon of 120 bp. Each PCR reaction mixture contained 10 \u03bcl of cDNA, 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas), 2 mmol/ L MgCI 2, 4 \u03bcmol each primer, 300 \u03bcmol /L each dNTP, 50 mmol /L KCI and 10 mmol /L Tris Cl (pH 8,5) .

Positive samples were confirmed by PCR amplification of a longer product of M gene. The longer M product used primers for hMPV- MR1 and a new primer, hMPV MF2 (ATGGAGTCCTATCTAGTAGTAGAC) which amplified the reigon between nucleotides 1 and 331 of the M gene, yielded an amplicon of 331 bp product. The cycling conditions were same for the first PCR but with annealing temperature of 62\u00b0C. Amplicons were analyzed on agarose gels (1%) after ethidium bromide staining.
