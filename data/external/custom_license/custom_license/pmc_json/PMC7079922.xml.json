The field of genome research, which has expanded from humans to other organisms, is flag-shipped by the Human Genome Project (HGP). The HGP was initiated in United States at the beginning of the 1990s, and has become an international collaborative project joined by the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, and China. The completion of the sequencing of the human genome was announced on 14 April 2003 by the heads of the six member states with an historic proclamation indicating that the goals of the HGP had been accomplished. Though a latecomer, China has contributed much to the field of human genome research through international collaborations and strong government support. This review summarizes recent progress in genome research achieved by major research institutions in China.",

Due to limited resources at that time, the goals of this first project were to focus on the establishment of the infrastructure and core technology, collection and storage of genetic samples, as well as the training of research professionals. This pioneer project marked the beginning of human genome research in China and laid the foundation for further projects which were subsequently supported by the central government through the National High-Tech Development Program (\u201c863 Programs\u201d), the National Developmental Program of Key Basic Research (\u201c973 Programs\u201d), and other research programs by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as well as by the Beijing, Shanghai, and other local governments. The whole governmental budget for genome research and other relevant projects, mainly devoted to research running costs, is about 200 million US dollars for the years 2001\u20132005. Dozens of research centers and laboratories have been established nation-wide (Table 1). In addition to the central and local governments, state-owned enterprises and domestic venture capital, joined lately by private companies and foreign investors, have also begun to invest in research and the development of genome-related technology and products. Two areas have been emphasized in human genome research in China: large-scale sequencing, genome diversity and proteomics; and the functional study of disease-related genes and other genes of scientific and economic significance.\n",

Under the supervision of a seven-member executive group headed by Dr. Huanming Yang, and through the joint efforts of the Beijing Genomics Institute (formerly the Human Genome Center, Institute of Genetics, CAS), the Chinese National Human Genome Center at Shanghai (CHGCS, or the South China National Human Genome Research Center) and the Chinese National Human Genome Center, Beijing (CHGB, or the North China National Human Genome Research Center) the mission working draft was finished on schedule at the end of May 2000. China generated 653,000 reads, 131% of the originally assigned task of 500,000 reads, with a total of non-abundant sequences of 27.5 Mb. The Chinese contribution to the working draft of the human genome is summarized in [1]. China announced the completion of the assigned region on 26 August 2001, a result of the productive collaboration of these three major centers.",

The first disease-related gene isolated by Chinese geneticists was the human gap junction protein \u03b2-3 (GJB3) by Dr. J.H. Xia\u2019s group (Table 2). Further mutation analysis revealed a missense mutation and a nonsense mutation of GJB3 associated with high-frequency hearing loss in two families [2]. In 2001, two groups, Dr. Y. Shen\u2019s group at CHGB and Dr. X.Y. Kong\u2019s group from the Shanghai Research Center of Biotechnology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, CAS, subsequently isolated the genes related to dentinogenesis imperfecta Shields type II (DGI-II). Shen et al. identified a nonsense mutation (Gln45\u2192stop) in exon 3 of the dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene in a Chinese family with dentinogenesis imperfecta Shields type II (DGI-II) [3]. Kong et al. identified mutations of the DSPP gene in three Chinese families: a donor site mutation (G\u2192T) in intron 3 of DSPP in family I, a missense mutation (C49\u2192A) in exon 2 of DSPP in family II, and a missense mutation (G52\u2192T) in exon 3 of DSPP in family 3. Two of these families also have progressive hearing loss [4].\n",

            "text": "Significant contributions have been made to the understanding of the molecular basis of leukemia and the mechanisms of differentiation and apoptosis as well as therapies for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by the Shanghai Institute of Hematology, headed by Dr. Zhu Chen. In most patients APL [15, 16] is characterized by the accumulation of promyelocytes containing a specific chromosomal translocation t(15;17) and exhibiting unique sensitivity to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) [17]. Following previous studies on the molecular basis of gene rearrangement after chromosomal translocation at locus t(15;17) [17, 18], their major contributions to the analysis of gene structure and function over the last 10 years include:Characterization of important rearrangements in the RAR\u03b1 gene on chromosome 17 and the MYL (later named PML) gene on chromosome 15, studies of the chimeric PML-RAR\u03b1 and RAR\u03b1-PML fusion genes [19], and sequencing of the entire genomic DNA region of the PML and RAR\u03b1genes [20, 21].Discovery of an unusual karyotype 46,XY t(11;17)(q23; q21) in APL [22], analysis of the PLZF-RAR\u03b1 fusion gene in the truncated locus of this chromosome, and the cloning and analysis of the newly discovered PLZF (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger) gene. PLZF encodes a potential transcription factor related to the Drosophila gap gene Kruppel and is expressed in at least two isoforms [23]. The entire genomic region of PLZF was sequenced [24]. The PLZF-RAR\u03b1 protein inhibits ligand-dependent transactivation of RAR\u03b1, reflecting the \u201cdominant negative\u201d effect of PLZF-RAR\u03b1 on wild-type RAR\u03b1 [25].Establishment of PLZF-RAR\u03b1and NPM-RAR\u03b1 transgenic mouse models [26]. PLZF-RAR\u03b1 transgenic animals developed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like disease, whereas NPM-RAR\u03b1 transgenic mice showed a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from typical APL to CML.Analysis of gene expression profiling in the APL cell line NB4 before and after ATRA treatment to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells [27]. More recently, a cDNA microarray with 13,014 clones was screened to further explore these gene expression networks. The results of this screen showed that 318 genes were up-regulated and 291 were down-regulated by ATRA in NB4 cells. In the early stage of ATRA treatment, genes involved in inhibition of proliferation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis antagonists were up-regulated, whereas with the onset of differentiation, genes related to granulocyte maturation and apoptosis agonists were up-regulated (unpublished data).The NUP98-PMX1 fusion gene was cloned from a CML [28, 29] patient with AML-M2 transformation and bearing a secondary chromosomal translocation t(1;11)(q23;p15), and the observation that NUP98-PMX1 transgenic mice developed myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloid leukemia was established. The fact that NUP98-PMX1 formed complexes only with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 in vivo and that its inhibitory effect on FOS could be abolished upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors strongly suggest that the NUP98-PMX1 chimera functions, at least for some genes, as a transcriptional inhibitor (unpublished data). NUP98/HOX11 [30] and MLL-EEN fusion genes found in acute leukemias with t(11;12) (p15;q13) and t(11;19)(q23;p13) were also cloned and the functions of those fusion genes are under investigation.\n",

No predisposing genes have been identified up to now, though the HLA-BW46 locus is associated with increased risk of NPC [31]. Dr. Y.X. Zeng\u2019s group [32] instigated the genome-wide scanning of 20 families with a high risk of NPC (2\u20139 affected members per family) from Guangdong Province. Fifty-four affected individuals were genotyped using 382 polymorphic microsatellite markers, covering 22 autosomes with an average marker density of 10 cM. Parametric analysis provided evidence of linkage to the D4S405 marker on chromosome 4 with a logarithm of odds for linkage (lod) score of 3.06 and a heterogeneity-adjusted lod (hlod) score of 3.21. Fine mapping with additional markers flanking D4S405 resulted in a lod score of 3.45 and hlod score of 3.67 for the region 4p15.1-q12. This region has been recently narrowed down to 8.29 cM by means of further analysis of the pedigrees with simple tandem repeat and SNP markers (unpublished data). These results indicate that a susceptibility locus on 4p15.1-q12 may account for a significant subset of hereditary NPC which provides a solid basis for future studies to identify the NPC susceptibility gene. However, the above genome-wide scan results did not indicate any obvious linkage to chromosome 6 which contains the MHC locus, even though previous reports have suggested an association between the risk of NPC and certain MHC haplotypes [31]. A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the different subjects studied: previous work was conducted with affected sib-pair families, whereas high-risk NPC pedigrees were used in this study.",

To further evaluate the nature of the allelic loss, comparative genomic hybridization was accomplished in 20 pairs of the above HCC samples. The combined analysis of these two methods revealed frequent allelic loss on 17p, 9p21-p23, 16q21-q23.3, 13q, 8p21-p23 and 6q24-q27, whereas the most frequent allelic gain occurred at 1q, 17q and 8q24. The highest incidence of allele loss was 17p13,3 (65%) [33]. Twenty-two paired HCC and non-cancerous liver samples were then analyzed with 14 polymorphic markers. The data revealed a high level of loss of heterozygosity (>68%) in a minimum region between D17S1866 and D17S1574, spanning over a 1.5 Mb region. A physical map was created based on large-scale sequencing of relevant cluster bacterial artificial chromosome/artificial chromosome clones. Seventeen known genes and 13 novel genes were identified in this minimum region, and the functions of these genes were characterized [34, 35, 36].",

These ESTs were then applied to a cDNA microarray system containing 12,393 genes/ESTs, and a commercial cDNA array of 1,176 known genes as target sequence sources. The integrated data from this study identified 2,253 genes/ESTs as candidates showing differential expression. A number of these differentially expressed genes were verified by RT-PCR, which revealed that many were involved in cell cycle regulation, such as the cyclin-dependent kinases, cell cycle negative regulators and metabolic regulators. Some of these candidate genes may be related to cancer cell differentiation. Also, the altered transcriptome profile of HCC may arise from a number of chromosome regions exhibiting loss of heterozygosity or amplification [37].",

This group has also studied the expression patterns of a dozen genes such as TGase 3, Mal and RH50 in esophageal carcinomas and has identified their association with human cancers for the first time. The full-length cDNA and genomic DNAs of two novel genes (DRC1 and DRC2) were characterized, and their chromosome location and tissue-specific distribution of expression were elucidated [40, 41, 42, 43]. They have found that the expression of NMES1 and gut-enriched Kruppel-like factor were down-regulated [44, 45], while EC45 was overexpressed [46] in esophageal cancer. They also showed that down-regulation of the three annexin I isoforms, identified by proteomics, was a frequent event in esophageal carcinogenesis [47], and that the alteration of p63 might play a significant role in the early steps in tumorigenesis [48].",

Several genome-wide scans recently accomplished in ethnic Chinese populations revealed a number of candidate loci possibly contributing to EH, and appeared to be replicable in 2q14-q23 and 5q32 [52, 53]. D.L. Zhu et al. reported linkage to the chromosome 2q14-q23 region for EH in a south China population [54, 55]. Several genes located in that region are considered to be relevant to the regulation of blood pressure and the development of EH. These genes include several G proteins and G protein-coupled receptors, a voltage-gated sodium channel protein and the gamma subunit of the sodium/potassium ATPase [56]. Another region, 5q32, harboring the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) gene, has been reported to be linked to EH in a Taiwanese population [57]. To repeat these results and perform quantitative linkage analysis, D.F. Gu et al. genotyped members of 148 hypertension families containing 328 affected sib pairs, and grouped families from Beijing and Jiangsu province with five highly informative microsatellite markers (D2S151, D2S142, D5S2090, D5S413 and D5S2013), but the results provided no evidence in support of significant linkage of 2q14-q23 or 5q32 with EH [58]. Any explanation for the above results will be complicated due to the number of factors involved. At best, these observations indicate the diversity in the etiology and complexity of hypertension.",

This study involved linkage analysis in 148 Chinese hypertensive families [59, 60]. Using the linkage model in SOLAR, a region of linkage with systolic blood pressure to a 10.6 cM on chromosome 8 (8p22) was identified by markers D8S1145, D8S261and D8S282 with a maximum two-point LOD score of 2.52 at D8S261 and a maximum multipoint LOD score of 2.03 near the marker D8S261. In the qualitative trait linkage analysis, evidence for linkage between the marker D8S1145 and EH was found (P=0.029); TDT/S-TDT also supported significant linkage disequilibrium with EH at allele 3 of D8S261 (\u03c72=8.643, P=0.01).
