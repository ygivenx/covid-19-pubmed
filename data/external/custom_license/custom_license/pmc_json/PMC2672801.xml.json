Clinical findings consisted of wheezing episodes, asthma exacerbations, acute obstructive bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia.11\u201315 Infants below the age of two years and patients with structural pulmonary diseases or immune disorders seem to be predominantly affected. Preliminary evidence is provided that acute HBoV infection may take a viremic course and may also be capable of persistence in the respiratory tract.16 HBoV infections appear endemic worldwide.16 First studies on the seroepidemiology give evidence for protection by maternal antibodies within the first months of life.17 In a Japanese study all of the 204 children examined had immunoglobulin G antibodies to the viral protein 1 (VP1) by the age of 6 years, emphasizing its ubiquitous nature.18 Taken together, these findings suggest that there is protective immunity after past infection which may explain why HBoV is comparatively rare in adults.9,19\u201322 Frequencies of HBoV detection in respiratory specimens of children described in the literature vary from 2% to 19%.11,23 Recently, a HBoV detection rate of 12% has been described among German children with symptoms of respiratory tract infections.24",
