We assessed 342,988 death reports of Tianjin residents collected from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2004. Cause of death was classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), for 1999 through 2002 and the 10th revision (ICD-10) for 2003 and 2004. We analyzed the change and distribution of mortality, maternal mortality, infant mortality, life expectancy, and years of potential life lost.",

Years of potential life lost from chronic diseases increased every year from 1999 through 2004. Because much chronic disease is attributed to lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, and smoking), many of these deaths could have been prevented. Unfortunately, as economic conditions improve, diets become less healthy, sedentary lifestyles become more common, and smoking becomes more prevalent (6). Among Tianjin residents aged 18 years or older, approximately 37% have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and 30% are obese (7). Injuries and poisoning are the most common causes of death among people aged 45 or younger, although years of potential life lost from injuries and poisoning are difficult to estimate (8,9).",

China's government has increased funding for disease prevention in the aftermath of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, but most of it has gone toward preventing infectious diseases. China must dedicate more resources to support health promotion and chronic disease control. A pilot program called Maintaining Normal Blood Pressure and Body Weight has been developed in urban communities to help control chronic disease. Funding, however, is inadequate for the program to benefit the large population of Tianjin, and because our findings show higher mortality from chronic disease in rural than in urban areas, health education and promotion programs must be developed for rural areas to decrease the disparity.",
