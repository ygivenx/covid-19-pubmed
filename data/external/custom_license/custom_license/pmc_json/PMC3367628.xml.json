            "text": "We start by considering the assembly of a 2-host community infected by a single pathogen (15,17,18) where the pathogen is endemic within host population H1 such that individuals of H1 are either susceptible (S1) or infected (I1). We then assume a second target host population (H2) enters the community and can become infected by the pathogen (Figure 1A). Since the pathogen is well established in H1, we assume S1 and I1 are unchanged by H2; thus, our model most closely resembles the asymmetric model of Dobson (15). In the terminology of Haydon et al. (12), H1 is a maintenance host species (or species complex) with the potential to be a disease reservoir for H2. H2 may or may not be a maintenance host (see below). The model is\n (model 1)where r is the reproductive rate, K the carrying capacity, and d the death rate of the infected hosts. The composite functions f22 and f12 describe the net within-species (H2 to H2) and between-species (H1 to H2) transmission rates, respectively. We assume density-dependent transmission and so these functions have the form fij = \u03b2ij Ii S2, where \u03b2ij is the per capita transmission rate from species i to species j. Therefore, for example, the net rate of transmission from H1 to H2 (f12) depends on the size of the susceptible target population (S2), the size of the reservoir (I1), and the level of exposure and susceptibility of H2 (\u03b212).",

These 4 outcomes are separated by 3 thresholds (Figure 1C): i) invasion threshold, ii) persistence threshold, and iii) host extinction threshold. The first 2 thresholds are analogous to established density-based thresholds in epidemiology; the first allows ecologic invasion of a pathogen, which subsequently dies out, and the second allows persistence of the pathogen (19). Here we combine these density effects with the per capita rates of infection to express these thresholds in terms of the magnitude of the net between- and within-species transmission rates (f12 and f22, respectively).",

Thus, although infections of H2 do occasionally occur, they are transient. This represents the case in which the pathogen is specialized to the endemic host and there is either very low exposure to H2 (an ecologic constraint, such as parasite transmission mode) or H2 is resistant to infection (a physiologic constraint). We recommend the term spillover to describe this form of cross-species infection. Previously, spillover has been used to describe a wide range of dynamics (20), but we recommend limiting its use to transient infections in a target host because of transmission from a reservoir host that is not self-sustaining in the target population.",

This case represents apparent multihost dynamics that differ from spillover dynamics in that the disease is nontransient in H2, but the pathogen is sustained because of frequent between-species transmission from the disease-endemic host. Apparent multihost dynamics exist because the potentially high prevalence in the target host would give the appearance of a true multihost pathogen, but the lack of within-species transmission means the disease cannot be maintained in the absence of H1. We recommend the term reservoir to describe H1 in both cases 1 and 2, in which the pathogen is permanently maintained in H1 and without between-species transmission (\u03b212), the disease would not persist in the target host.",

Thus, the pathogen can persist in the target host (H2), but the net rate of between-species transmission is so low that H2 is rarely exposed to the disease. This case might occur when a disease is transmitted through close contact and thus has little chance of transmission between species. Similarly, the barrier to infection could be an ecologic factor, such as geographic isolation, which may be overcome by an anthropogenic change such as the introduction of exotic or invasive species. Thus, this case represents a potential emerging infectious disease in which the pathogen will become self-sustaining in H2 once the initial barrier to infection has been crossed. This case may be the region of greatest future concern since a single transmission event can have devastating consequences because of the high rate of within-species transmission in the target host.",

Parasites transmitted by close contact may have limited exposure to multiple species and thus transmission modes that decouple host-to-host contact (i.e., waterborne or soilborne transmission) will increase the opportunity for between-species transmission. Evidence from wild primates and humans shows that pathogens with direct contact transmission are associated with high host specificity (1,3).

For example, avian influenza has emerged several times in human populations since 1997. Typically, limited human-to-human transmission exists (\u03b222 \u2248 0), so that although the avian reservoir (I1) and susceptible human populations (S2) are high, outbreaks are rare and isolated (i.e., occupying region 1 of the continuum). Only through recombination between strains and acquisition of human-specific respiratory epithelium receptors (thereby increasing \u03b222) could the virus evolve sufficient transmissibility to be sustained in the human population, which poses the greatest risk for pandemics (33). These genetic changes could shift avian flu from being a spillover to becoming a true multihost parasite, which would have serious implications for human health.",

Therefore, we must investigate population dynamic properties of different regions of the continuum and regions that pose the greatest risk for a target host. In a deterministic model, the invasion and persistence thresholds are the same and are determined by the pathogen's basic reproductive ratio (R0); if R0>1, an initial infection can both become established and persist. As shown by Dobson (15), R0 for a pathogen in an asymmetric host community (with no back-transmission from the target host to the reservoir) is dominated by the largest within-species transmission term, which implies that infection dynamics in the 2 host populations are largely independent; once between-species transmission has occurred, infection in H2 is driven solely by within-H2 transmission. However, in the stochastic reality of the natural world, an established infection may fade out, and reinfection from H1 could occur in the future (19). Therefore, we developed a stochastic analog of the above deterministic model to explore dynamics of the community-epidemiology continuum. The model was a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation model, in which each event in model 1 (births, deaths, between- and within-species transmission) occurred probabilistically, and the next event was chosen at random based on those probabilities. The model was run 100 times for different combinations of within- and between-species transmission rates, and the infection status of the target host (H2) was measured as the mean prevalence over time, the proportion of time the pathogen was absent from H2 (the proportion of time the pathogen faded out), and the proportion of runs in which the pathogen drove the host to extinction. This stochastic model is appropriate for exploring the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases not captured by continuous-time deterministic models, in particular when exposure of a target host to a pathogen from a reservoir is likely to occur at discrete intervals (27).",

Increasing the exposure of H2 to the pathogen (i.e., increasing \u03b212) leads to a gradual increase in both the prevalence of infection and the proportion of time the pathogen is present in H2. This increase applies even if within-H2 transmission is negligible (\u03b222 \u2192 0). Therefore, regular, high exposure to the pathogen from the reservoir can give the appearance of endemic infection, even if the pathogen cannot be sustained within the population (case 2: apparent multihost dynamics). Increasing the within-H2 transmission rate (\u03b222) from very low levels has little impact on the prevalence of infection or the proportion of time H2 is infected. Eventually, however, a point is reached at which increasing \u03b222 suddenly allows the long-term persistence of the pathogen in H2. At this point, the persistence threshold is reached and the pathogen becomes endemic in H2, regardless of input from H1. This threshold can be approximated from the deterministic model by setting \u03b212 = 0 and solving for R0 = 1, which shows that \u03b222 must be > (d + r)/K for the pathogen to persist in the absence of input from H1 (the horizontal line in Figure 3).",

Analysis of the equivalent deterministic model (model 1) suggests that this threshold should be in the between-species transmission rate (\u03b212) only (host extinction is not affected by \u03b222) and is given by \u03b212 > dr/(d \u2013 r) for H2 extinction to occur (shown by the vertical line in Figure 3).

Haydon et al. (13) proposed 3 means of controlling infection in a target-reservoir system: 1) target control, which is aimed at controlling infection within the target population; 2) blocking tactics, to prevent transmission between the reservoir and target host population; and 3) reservoir control, which suppresses infection within the reservoir. These 3 control strategies correspond to reducing the within- and between-species transmission rates (\u03b222, \u03b212, and \u03b211, respectively). The benefits of each approach will vary according to the relative contributions different transmission processes make to the overall prevalence in the new host (H2). Our stochastic model showed that high exposure to the pathogen from the reservoir host can give the appearance of endemic infection in the target host, even if it cannot sustain the pathogen alone. In this case, the optimal control strategy is completely different from that used against a true multihost pathogen endemic in the target host. For a host-pathogen system in region 2 of the continuum (apparent multihost dynamics), where between-species transmission rates are high but within-H2 transmission rates are low (point A in Figure 3A), the prevalence of infection in H2 may be very high, but mounting a target control program aimed at reducing within-H2 transmission is unlikely to be effective (the vertical arrow from point A in Figure 3A). However, blocking control, which would reduce transmission from the reservoir to the target host, may drastically reduce prevalence (the horizontal arrow from point A in Figure 3A). Conversely, similar levels of prevalence in H2 may be observed for a host-pathogen system located in region 4 of the continuum (point B in Figure 3A) but because of fundamentally different processes. In this case, blocking tactics aimed at preventing transmission from the reservoir to the target host will be ineffectual (horizontal arrow from point B in Figure 3A), but target control may prove highly effective (vertical arrow from point B in Figure 3A). Therefore, establishing the initial location of a novel host-pathogen system within the community-epidemiology continuum and understanding the within- and between-species transmission rates are essential for optimizing vaccination and culling strategies to lessen the impact of disease.",
