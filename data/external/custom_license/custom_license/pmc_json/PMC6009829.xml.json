This ensemble is then pruned of models that are: (i) energetically unfavorable, (ii) inconsistent with the data, or (iii) too similar to another solution in the ensemble.

The first included domains C and D of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) spike protein at 4.0-\u00c5 resolution21. The MHV spike protein is a homotrimer comprising \u223c1,300 residues per protomer, the bulk of which was solved using homology modeling and de novo fragment docking. However, only 30 of the 180 residues comprising domains C and D could be assigned using de novo fragment docking. Starting from this 30-residue fragment, we completed an atomic structure using RosettaES and tracing in parallel. The top-scoring RosettaES models were visually selected and refined22,23,24. RosettaES was carried out in multiple steps; the 154-residue C terminus of domain D was poorly converged when run to completion, so it was instead broken into two separate runs of 125 and 29 residues, where the best model after refinement of the first run served as a seed for the second. Comparing this model with a manually traced model revealed significant topological differences between the two. The RosettaES model displays several key features that suggest it is correct: three disulfide bonds accounted for by the density and the observation of extra density corresponding to a glycosylated asparagine residue. The recent determination of the orthologous HCoV-NL63 (ref. 25) and HKU1 (ref. 26) spikes confirm our model (Fig. 2a\u2013f; PDB 3jcl).",

The closer the GDT-HA is to 1, the more similar the structures. Values above the solid line indicate a more accurate solution with RosettaES than RosettaCM.

(c) The deposited structure of FrhA (PDB 4ci0) shown in the cryo-EM density map, with the starting model in blue and the removed region in red. Residues 187\u2013265 (highlighted in red) were removed in the benchmark. (d) The top-scoring solution generated by RosettaCM, shown in yellow.
