Recently, a study posted in medRxiv4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19\nin the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%)\npatients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale\nof the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus. Also, a finding\npublished on a patient who had loss of involuntary control over breathing5 during the recent outbreak with several other\npatients suffering acute respiratory failure implores healthcare professionals\nand clinicians to segregate COVID-19 patients into neurologically\naffected cases and those who are devoid of neurological deficits.",

In the later study,6 it was shown that the ACE2 binding affinity of\nthe 2019-nCoV spike protein ectodomain was 10\u201320-fold higher\nthan that of the SARS-CoV spike protein.
