Close contacts, which included anyone who lived with, visited, provided care for, or had other similarly close contact with case-patients while they were symptomatic, were identified from interviews and other sources (e.g., hospital documentation).

Among ED HCWs, we estimate a 16% attack rate, \u22484 times higher than average household transmission estimates (4). Our findings add to previously reported examples of more extensive transmission occurring in healthcare facilities in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan (5,6,11\u201313) and suggest that, in the absence of appropriate infection prevention measures, healthcare settings may be particularly efficient for MERS-CoV transmission. As described during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, transmission in healthcare settings may be increased by various factors: higher than usual infectiousness of patients because of high viral loads or presence of symptoms that increase shedding; use of procedures that aerosolize infectious respiratory illness; close patient\u2013HCW proximity during medical encounters; and other not-yet-identified factors (26). Extensive contact-tracing practices in Abu Dhabi, including testing contacts of case-patients regardless of symptoms, and whole-genome sequencing were essential for fully characterizing the transmission patterns in this cluster.",

After diagnosis, >500 patient-days of hospital care were provided to case-patients in Abu Dhabi; among HCWs providing this care, 1 infection occurred in an ICU nurse who reported not fully adhering to recommended prevention measures while she cared for a case-patient. Although delayed diagnosis contributed to all other transmission events, reasons for delays varied, highlighting challenges faced by the healthcare community: 1 patient was infected early in the outbreak, before high visibility of MERS-CoV and prevention policies; 1 patient sought care from an ED but had no known epidemiologic risk factors for MERS-CoV; 1 hospitalized patient had MERS-CoV symptoms that could be explained by other concurrent conditions; 1 infected HCW with mild illness did not report symptoms and continued working while ill. In the largest cluster, despite strong hospital and public health policies for triaging and isolating patients with respiratory symptoms as part of the MERS-CoV response, the source case-patient was placed under standard precautions, rather than contact and airborne precautions (27). Reasons for not implementing protocols in this instance are unknown, but the patient\u2019s lack of known risk factors (e.g., exposure to a case-patient) likely contributed to low clinical suspicion. This cluster underscores the importance of maintaining vigilance and adherence to infection prevention policy, particularly in regions where known MERS-CoV infections exist.",

            "text": "This investigation has several limitations. Although the healthcare clusters we describe are supported epidemiologically and steps were taken to ensure that clusters were conservatively constructed (e.g., excluding healthcare workers with known exposures in the community), other transmission pathways cannot be excluded. Genetic sequencing of a limited number of cases supports the epidemiologic characterization of cases and clusters, but we were unable to sequence and assess the molecular relatedness of all case isolates, a step that previous investigations have shown to be informative (11,28). On the basis of the current understanding of the mutation rate of MERS-CoV, the genetic differences observed in case isolates from clusters II and III are consistent with 2 separate introductions (11); however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these clusters are related. Furthermore, transmission pathways were generated on the basis of self-reporting or other documentation, and exposures may have been missed or forgotten. Such lapses might explain the difficulty in ascertaining a source of exposure for 1 healthcare-associated case (patient V). In addition, follow-up serologic testing for MERS-CoV\u2013specific antibodies and repeat PCR testing were not performed on healthcare-associated contacts, so additional cases may have been missed. Last, by restricting our definition of healthcare-associated cases to persons with recognized exposures in healthcare settings, we may underestimate the true number of cases, particularly if sources of infection (i.e., case-patients) went undetected. Because our objective was to characterize transmission patterns among known healthcare-associated cases, we considered the conservative definition to be most appropriate.",

MERS-CoV can clinically appear with mild or nonspecific respiratory symptoms, and patients may seek care without having known risk factors for infection. Maintaining a high index of suspicion in every patient encounter, especially at first points of patient entry such as EDs or primary healthcare settings, is imperative, particularly in regions reporting MERS-CoV cases. Early detection of cases, full adherence to infection prevention recommendations, and recognition of illness among HCWs are necessary factors to prevent further transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare settings. Supporting healthcare facilities in these efforts remains a priority.",
