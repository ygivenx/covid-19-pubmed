Our approach allowed us to contact and question several hundred geographically dispersed persons in a matter of days. Survey respondents' answers were automatically stored in a secure electronic database, eliminating the need for data entry. With the development of questionnaire templates, a public health official could select sets of questions and pre-coded answers from pull-down menus and modify them to design an outbreak-specific, Web-based questionnaire that is automatically linked to an electronic database (5). These methods make it increasingly possible to design and post a Web-based investigative tool for wide distribution within hours.",

Use of a Web-based investigation tool limited responses to only those Transplant Games attendees with known email addresses and Internet access. The initial response rate to our survey was only 34%; households with ill persons may have been more likely to respond to our Web-based survey. However, most (>75%) respondents to both surveys were from households in which no one had experienced illness, which provided us with a sufficient number of responses from both well and ill persons to identify the source of the outbreak. Hospitalized and severely ill persons may have been too sick to respond to the survey or may have been unable to access the Internet, which limited our ability to calculate accurate hospitalization or attack rates among persons attending the Transplant Games. Although isolation of S. Javiana from plant X diced tomatoes would have strengthened our findings, the tomatoes tested were processed well after the outbreak period, when levels of contamination may have differed considerably.",

The development of Web-based public health investigative tools can facilitate future investigations of outbreaks affecting geographically dispersed persons who may be part of an electronic mail cohort. A Web-based approach to data collection can also play a critical role in rapidly sharing data in outbreaks involving multiple jurisdictions (7). The growing use of Web-based technologies in public health investigations will have to be balanced with the need to protect the privacy of personal information in the online environment (8,9). The careful application of emerging technologies and conventional epidemiologic techniques can help public health officials effectively cope with the multitude of changing factors that shape public health in the United States.",
