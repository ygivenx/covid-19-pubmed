The model consisted of 2 distinct populations in Singapore: the general population and an HCW population (Figure 1A). Singapore\u2019s mid-year population in 2005 was 4.35 million, and the public HCW population of 20,000 represented essential staff that required protection. Oseltamivir was the neuraminidase-inhibitor modeled because of its effectiveness in treatment and prophylaxis, good safety profile, and common use in national stockpiles (5\u20138). Standard treatment regimen was 75 mg, twice per day for 5 days, and prophylaxis required 75 mg once per day for as long as planned.",

Three strategies for HCWs were considered: no action (providing symptomatic relief), treatment only (early treatment of all symptomatic HCW infections), and prophylaxis (prophylaxis together with early treatment). Different predetermined prophylaxis substrategies were considered, based on the weeks of prophylaxis; each additional week required 140,000 doses in addition to separate treatment stockpiles. To be conservative, we assumed that prophylaxis stockpiles would last only for the planned duration. Separate analyses explored the effect of stopping prophylaxis after individual clinical infection, with redistribution of prophylaxis doses to other HCWs to prolong prophylaxis beyond the planned duration; however, this strategy is only possible if tests can promptly confirm individual infection and logistics networks allow for redistribution.",

The first source was exposures from colleagues (HCW-to-HCW transmission) at a proportion (\u03c9); the second was from persons outside the workplace (1-\u03c9). In the absence of published estimates, the base case assumed that 50% of infections were attributed to HCW-to-HCW transmission, with sensitivity analysis performed from 20% to 80%. The third source was from general population case-patients (patient-to-HCW transmission), expressed as the ratio of susceptible HCWs who could be infected by incident case-patients who sought treatment from the healthcare system (H/P). The extent of transmission is dependent on interventions such as barrier precautions (11). On the basis of findings from exploratory analysis, increasing the H/P ratio moves the HCW epidemic earlier; at an H/P of 2.08, the HCW epidemic peaks before the start of prophylaxis, negating the outcomes of prophylaxis. Therefore, H/P values >2 do not substantially contribute to the outcomes and study conclusions, and sensitivity analysis was performed for H/P from 0 to 2 (Technical Appendix). Transmission from HCWs to patients was assumed negligible compared with other sources of infection for the general population, and the general population epidemic was independent of transmission dynamics within the HCW population.",

The HCW epidemic coincided with the general population epidemic if the patient-to-HCW infections variable was minimized (H/P = 0). Increasing H/P alone shifted the HCW epidemic such that it preceded the general population epidemic and amplified peak absenteeism by as much as 1.4 for the base case. For the prophylaxis strategies, increasing the patient-to-HCW transmission resulted in the distribution of HCW absenteeism away from the postprophylaxis period into the pre- and intraprophylaxis periods, which resulted in lower peak absenteeism up to a point. For H/P >2.0, peak absenteeism occurred before initiation of prophylaxis, negating the effect of longer durations of prophylaxis. Under all HCW-to-HCW and patient-to-HCW transmission scenarios for a base-case pandemic, 6 weeks of prophylaxis provided equal or superior results to treatment only; 8 weeks of prophylaxis was always superior (Technical Appendix).",

Although changes in the transmission parameters substantially changed peak absenteeism levels for certain scenarios, the overall conclusions remained similar.

As shown in previous studies, treatment provides benefits over no action and should be considered in preparedness plans to reduce illness and death (2,3,21). Using prophylaxis to prevent infection results in a secondary increase in infections after prophylaxis is stopped because susceptible HCWs remain in the general population when transmission occurs. Insufficient durations of prophylaxis thus result in poorer outcomes than treatment only. For prophylaxis strategies to accrue more benefits than treatment only, the prophylaxis duration must be sufficient to cover the pandemic\u2019s peak. Eight weeks of prophylaxis, the maximum safe duration previously studied (22), was sufficient to provide a substantial reduction in peak absenteeism under a broad range of assumptions for more severe pandemics where peak absenteeism exceeded 10%. Six weeks of prophylaxis was marginally beneficial, if one assumes that prophylaxis was initiated after incident pandemic cases exceeded 10% of the baseline ILI rate.",

Improved surveillance, critical for early detection, paradoxically increases the likelihood of initiating prophylaxis too early, causing predetermined estimates of stockpile duration to be inaccurate. Many countries have developed comprehensive preparedness plans to reduce a pandemic\u2019s spread. These may prolong the pandemic\u2019s duration within the country, which would compound the issue of stockpile adequacy. If prophylaxis is started prematurely, stockpiles will be exhausted before the delayed waves of the pandemic occur and thus will not reduce absenteeism more than would treatment only. Prophylaxis should not be initiated until a certain point in the epidemic curve, but this may be difficult, given public sentiment and pressure. Further studies are needed to determine the ideal time for prophylaxis initiation and the role of surveillance in evaluating the pandemic phases and projected spread.",

Another limitation is that effects over the entire HCW population were aggregated. In reality, subsets of HCWs exist with varying levels of exposure. Stochastic variation and nosocomial outbreaks, which were not modeled, may result in higher local absenteeism rates than predicted by this model. Further studies that use individual-based stochastic models may provide improved representation of disease transmission to test other interventions.
