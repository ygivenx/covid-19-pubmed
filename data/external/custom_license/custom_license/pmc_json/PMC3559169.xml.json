In addition to the severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemics, pandemics in poultry of highly-pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) virus, the intercontinental transmission of Vibrio cholerae, and the spread of emergent antimicrobial resistance are exacerbated by global trade and travel. Local infectious disease events have the potential to develop rapidly into international public health emergencies. The specific epidemiologic profile of infectious agents varies because infectious agents can readily transfer between distinct reservoirs. Rapid detection and analysis of and timely public health response to infectious diseases worldwide are crucial for the prevention and global spread of infectious diseases. The World Health Organization International Health Regulations (5) encompass these values and provide a useful platform to strengthen the need for global surveillance, monitoring, and reporting.",

PulseNet utilizes standardized technology and informatics to acquire and analyze pathogen genotypes in a way that supports full interoperability between all network members. Although the final genome product is entirely standardized and infinitely sharable, the raw DNA sequencing data produced across different genomics platforms are not. This was illustrated during a study of the cholera outbreak in Haiti, in which it was not possible to readily compare data from different studies because of differences in raw data read formats (10,13). Because of the increasingly rapid pace of genomics, a new set of standards is required for genome sequences (14).",

Such methods have great advantages in being easy and having a high through-put and low cost. Furthermore, some of the methods may be used directly on the clinical samples, further reducing time and cost. A limitation of the currently available methods is that they do not reliably identify isolates at the subspecies and clonal level, do not give sufficient information on different virulence and resistance genes, and are difficult to standardize in a way that enables global exchange of data.

At the same time, diplomacy will be required to engage relevant stakeholders, funding institutions, the private sector, and the technical constituencies and to overcome potential obstacles, such as reluctance of researchers to share data before publication; reluctance of governments and institutions to share data when there are competing interests, such as trade and tourism; legal and ethical issues regarding sharing of information, including patenting and intellectual property; and the need to guarantee confidentiality during public health emergencies and to protect individual patient\u2019s privacy rights. Some of these potential obstacles may be good precautions or required practices and should not necessarily be changed.
