Alarmingly, human-to-human transmission\nduring close contact, especially in elderly or patients with underlying health\nconditions, has also been reported for MERS-CoV (19\u201322). In the wake of the recent upsurge in the\nlaboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including two recently identified cases in\nthe United States (23), there is an urgent\nneed to study and characterize the properties of important drug targets of MERS-CoV\nfor the development of effective therapeutics.",

The addition or deletion of amino acids, e.g.\nHis6 affinity tags, at either the N or C terminus drastically reduces\nthe enzymatic rate and decreases the ability of SARS-CoV 3CLpro to\ndimerize (37). Although cellular evidence for\nthe auto-cleavage mechanism (cis versus trans) of 3CLpro\nis lacking, models for how 3CLpro cleaves itself from the polyprotein to\nform the mature dimer have been proposed based on in vitro studies\nusing purified 3CLpro (34, 39, 40).\nA current model posits that two inactive 3CLpro molecules within two\nseparate polyproteins recognize each other and form an immature dimer capable of\ncleaving the nsp4\u2193nsp5 and nsp5\u2193nsp6 sites in\ntrans, followed by formation of an active and mature dimer that can\nthen rapidly process other cleavage sites and multiple polyproteins. It has also\nbeen proposed that substrate-induced dimerization regulates the enzymatic activity\nof SARS-CoV 3CLpro during virus replication; however, no experimental\nevidence of this has ever been demonstrated in infected cells (40). Although our knowledge of SARS-CoV 3CLpro\nis extensive, the dimerization properties of 3CLpro from MERS-CoV and\nother coronaviruses, as well as the factors regulating their enzymatic activity,\nremain largely unknown.",

Two\narginine residues, Arg-4 and Arg-298 (Fig.\n7, A\u2013C), form some of the key\ninteractions at the dimer interface of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, and\nmutation of either of these amino acids results in a drastic loss of\ndimerization in SARS-CoV 3CLpro (36, 38).

Therefore, we\ninitially thought that the loss of these key interactions might simply\nexplain the >100,000-fold weaker dimerization observed for\nMERS-CoV 3CLpro compared with SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\nSurprisingly, however, structural analysis of the dimer interface from\nthe available x-ray structure of HKU4-CoV 3CLpro (PDB code\n2YNB;\nFig. 7, B and\nC), and primary sequence alignment of\n3CLpro from MERS-CoV, HKU5-CoV, HKU4-CoV and SARS-CoV\n(Fig. 8) revealed that Val-4\nand Met-298 are conserved between all the \u03b2-CoV 2c members\nstudied here. Substantial differences between the ability of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro and HKU4/HKU5-CoV 3CLpro to dimerize,\ndespite their high sequence identity, led us to the hypothesis that\nnonconserved residues between MERS-CoV and other \u03b2-CoV 2c\nmembers that are remote from the dimer interface may play a significant\nrole in dimer formation.",

The steps proposed for auto-release of MERS-CoV\n3CLpro from the polyprotein (steps\n1\u20134, Fig. 10)\nhave been adapted from Chen et al.

Based on the differences\nbetween the properties of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and MERS-CoV\n3CLpro, as highlighted in our studies, we added two\nadditional steps (steps 5 and 6, Fig. 10) that MERS-CoV\n3CLpro may need to utilize for efficient polyprotein\nprocessing. In Fig. 10,\nstep 1, two immature MERS-CoV 3CLpro\nmonomers in the polyprotein approach each other and form an immature\ndimer via interactions between domain III, which allows each of the\nmonomers to insert their N termini into the active site of the other\nmonomer. In step 2, the N termini are cleaved, and the\ndimer with uncleaved C termini adopts a conformation similar to the\nmature dimer. Our observation of auto-cleavage of the N-terminal\nHis6 tag from MERS-CoV 3CLpro during\nexpression in bacterial cells supports steps 1 and\n2, where formation of an immature dimer capable of\nauto-processing the N terminus occurs. In step 3, two\ndimers with uncleaved C termini approach each other, followed by\ninsertion of the C terminus from one dimer into one of the active sites\nof the other dimer.
