He had had a cough productive of whitish sputum for 2 weeks. He also had diarrhea and had vomited several times before his admission. His previous health had been good, and he had no history of recent travel. Physical examination showed a temperature of 40.2\u00b0C and bronchial breath sounds at the right upper zone lung field. Chest x-ray confirmed right upper lobe consolidation (Figure, part A).",

The patient had mild renal impairment, with a creatinine of 119 \u03bcmol/L, urea and electrolytes within normal limits, and alanine transaminase mildly elevated at 90 IU/L (normal <58 IU/L). Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels were normal. C-reactive protein was 6.5 mg/L (normal <9.9 mg/L). A diagnosis of atypical or viral pneumonia was suspected because of the low leukocyte count and normal C-reactive protein. Other laboratory tests were performed, including blood, sputum, and urine cultures, nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza and parainfluenza, indirect immunofluorescence for respiratory syncytial viral antigen detection, and atypical pneumonia titer (for adenovirus, psittacosis, Q fever, influenza A and B, and mycoplasma). The patient received treatment with intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate and oral clarithromycin.",

His pulse and blood pressure were normal, and his oxygen saturation was approximately 98% on room air. A sputum culture yielded normal oral flora, and sputum smears were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Nasopharyngeal aspiration was negative for influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, and 3, with the use of commercial immunofluorescence assay. A chest radiograph on day 4 showed progression of pneumonia, with consolidation changes over the right upper and lower lobes (Figure, part B). A repeat complete blood profile showed a leukocyte count of 5.4 x 109/L with persistent lymphopenia and a platelet count of 98 x 109/L. Amoxicillin-clavulanate was therefore changed to intravenous cefotaxime, 1 g every 8 h; clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day) was continued. As the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated progressively and he had difficulty in expectorating sputum, salbutamol, 0.5 g four times a day, driven by a jet nebulizer at 6 L of oxygen per min, was given to assist mucociliary clearance. His oxygen saturation remained normal without supplemental oxygen.",

The super-spread event in Prince of Wales Hospital caused by this patient was related to failure to apply isolation precautions, as the disease had not been recognized during the early part of his admission. The use of a nebulized bronchodilator may also have enhanced the spread of the virus in the ward, and this practice was stopped for patients with suspected SARS after this incident (7).",
