These discrepant results may reflect our study design, with a smaller study population (44 versus 71 participants) and relatively less frequent sampling (quarterly versus every 2 months). In addition, the UK study included children between the ages 0 and 18, whereas our study excluded patients under 6 years of age. It might be expected that rhinoviruses were more commonly associated with pulmonary exacerbations when younger children were included. Studies in hospitalized children under five who do not have CF have demonstrated rates of rhinovirus\u2010associated hospitalization of 4\u00b78 per 1000 children, with much higher rates in those with a history of wheezing or asthma (25\u00b73 hospitalizations pre\u20101000 children).\n18\n\n",

The question of contamination of sputum samples by respiratory viruses in the upper airway is another potential concern. However, the distribution of our concordant and discordant samples argues against this. Finally, the frequency of sampling (that was chosen to reflect current clinical practice guidelines) was not sufficiently frequent to detect viral infections early in their course.",
