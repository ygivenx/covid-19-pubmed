On the one hand, measures to increase personal safety were welcomed; on the other, the reassurances that did not always match infection control directives raised concerns about whose information, among infection control and public health colleagues, was most reliable. Health care workers suffered from lack of accurate information because the nuances of this strange new epidemic were not fully understood. Media reports further contributed to confusion and lack of trust by sensationalizing world events, with daily headlines reporting the number of suspected and probable cases, the number of dead and the number of health care providers succumbing to the illness.",

At the beginning of each shift, they had to stand in lines outside the only open hospital door, filling out forms, having their temperature taken and washing their hands before onlooking volunteers or redeployed workers. Such restrictions and monitoring were unprecedented. On the positive side, new close relationships were forged between infection control and ICU teams, and it was a unique opportunity for us to work together, learn from each other and gain a deep respect for each other's knowledge and expertise.",

Our infection control colleagues, both physicians and nonphysicians, cannot be praised highly enough for their herculean efforts and patience. They bore the brunt of the frustrations and complaints. While new relationships were forged between infection control and ICU teams, the pressure on them was immense as their knowledge and directives were repeatedly challenged. People are much quicker to criticize than to praise. The SARS outbreak challenged us to learn how to convey respect in the midst of frustrations over the lack of knowledge and challenging working conditions, and to thank our colleagues for their incredible efforts to keep us safe.",

Patients with SARS were cared for in negative pressure isolation rooms and staff were told to minimize entry as much as possible. In many units video cameras were used to monitor patients. In recent years ICU teams have focused on bringing the humanity back into our highly technological environment, and so having to decrease human contact and deploy more technology struck many of us as sadly ironic. Furthermore, the ICU team, trained to rush in to save someone's life and to respond quickly to any deterioration, found themselves being asked to put aside this ingrained sense of professional responsibility and to ensure that they took infection control precautions and were properly attired before rushing in. The resulting delays when every minute counts led many to question their professional integrity \u2013 how do you balance your own safety and your patient's needs?",

For professionals who pride themselves on caring, to deny access and to fail to be able to support patients and families during this time was devastating psychologically. It quickly became apparent that many patients who would have to be denied access might well die or be irreversibly compromised by delays in their care. Receiving referral calls about patients who required your centre's particular expertise, and either being unable to accept them because of a lack of beds or knowing the delay in transfer and/or treatment required to observe the necessary infection controls might result in worse outcomes was demoralizing.",

This was recently applied to the issue of ICU resource allocation in two studies in the pre-SARS era in Toronto [10,11]. The framework has four basic components: relevance, publicity, appeal and enforcement. These four components could well be applied to the ethical issues surrounding SARS, with specific emphasis on the first two. Relevance means reasons; decisions must be based on the best scientific and public health information available. Every effort must be made to avoid heresay, over-reacting and making decisions apparently motivated by simply being seen to be exercising due diligence [12]. Publicity means transparency; all stakeholders must be informed of policies and procedures in an open and timely manner. This includes patients, their families and health care workers.",
