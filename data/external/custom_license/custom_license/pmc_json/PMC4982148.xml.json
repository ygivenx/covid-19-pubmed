Biased techniques, such as amplicon sequencing, have proven to be effective in complex sample backgrounds in which titers of the target pathogen might be low, but such approaches limit characterization to known pathogens and require additional viral genome amplification (1\u20134). Unbiased techniques that require viral genome amplification (5) or that have been optimized for bacterial genomes (6,7) require longer sample and library preparation times, but can detect low pathogen titers or create highly accurate genomic data. We sequenced unamplified poly(A)-tailed viral RNA using rapid cDNA library preparation coupled with real-time data analysis to determine its potential application for pathogen genomic characterization.",

The poly(A)-tailing method was chosen because the reverse transcription primer adapters designed by Oxford Nanopore were developed to interact directly with the motor protein necessary for guiding DNA through the nanopores. This method greatly reduced preparation time and eliminated need for adaptor ligation reagents. This approach can be revisited for sequencing negative-strand RNA viruses (2,5). Despite this limitation, the RefSeq alignments and nearest neighbor calls were possible with limited data, demonstrating the potential power of long-read rapid sequencing on nanopore platforms.",

This method definitively identified VEEV TC-83 and differentiated it from wild-type VEEV in \u22483 hours, including only 15 min of data acquisition on MinION. VEEV TC-83 was also differentiated from other alphavirus genomes, facilitating strain-level identification of TC-83.

If samples derived directly from clinical matrices (e.g., blood, saliva) were used, this method would probably not support the necessary depth to characterize virus genomes unless the pathogen titer within these samples was high.

A) Sample preparation workflow for nanopore sequencing. First, viral RNA from BHK21 cell cultures of VEEV TC-83 was isolated, then single strand complimentary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized. The resulting RNA/cDNA hybrids were then prepared for nanopore sequencing and sequenced with data analysis occurring in real time. B) Genome organization and sequencing coverage over time of VEEV TC-83. VEEV is an alphavirus; its genome consists of a single strand of positive-sense RNA that can be translated into a polyprotein. Translation is critically dependent on the genomic 3\u2032 poly(A)-tail. This tail can be used for reverse transcription priming by using poly-(dT) primers that anneal to it. Read data was aligned to VEEV TC-83 (accession number L01443) by using the multiple sequence alignment program LAST (Computational Biology Research Consortium, Tokyo, Japan [Technical Appendix]). The coverage map shows the depth of genome coverage over 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of sequencing runtime, with the greatest depth observed at the 3\u2032 end of the VEEV genome.
