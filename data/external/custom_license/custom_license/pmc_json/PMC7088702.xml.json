The third section describes the research design applied in this study that was divided into three phases. The fourth section reports results from the three phases of the study that relate to the risk and stigma associated with drinking and smoking. The final section discusses the conclusions drawn from the findings of the three-phased study and recommendations for future research.",

African studies have found that HIV and TB are seen to be closely linked and highly stigmatised (Gelaw et al. 2001; Godfrey-Faussett et al. 2002). However, several international studies, as well as our own, have found that a lesser stigma is commonly associated with TB than with HIV/AIDS mainly owing to the mode of transmission (Nichter 1994; Balabanova et al. 2006; Macq et al. 2006; Mak et al. 2006; Daftary et al. 2007; M\u00f8ller and Erstad 2007). Sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV tend to be associated with an immoral lifestyle that underpins stigmatisation. A Russian study found that TB was known as a \u2018clean\u2019 disease; HIV/AIDS as a \u2018dirty\u2019 disease (Balabanova et al. 2006). A study conducted in Hong Kong that compared the public stigma related to AIDS, TB and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) found AIDS was associated with the most stigma, followed first by TB, then by SARS (Mak et al. 2006).",

In the South African context, the government\u2019s denialist stance towards the AIDS epidemic has served to increase the fear and stigma associated with HIV-infection, that in turn has spilled over onto TB. Daftary et al. (2007) observed that co-infected South African TB patients used a strategy described by Goffman (1963) in his classical study of stigma as \u2018covering\u2019. A person with several discreditable attributes \u2018covers\u2019 the dominant stigma with a less damaging one. In the South African study, individuals co-infected with TB and HIV/AIDS preferred to disclose TB rather than HIV as it was seen to be less stigmatising. AIDS as the dominant stigma was associated with personal blame and immoral behaviour while TB was less likely to be perceived as being morally reprehensible (Daftary et al. 2007). Other examples in the literature demonstrate that members of marginal groups may adopt an identity that defines them in opposition to a stigmatising label (Collins et al. 2008; Lichtenstein 2008).",

According to Deacon\u2019s (2005) extensive literature review, disease stigma can be understood as a problem of fear and blame rather than as a problem of ignorance. Importantly, stigma may consist of beliefs that are part of a social process that differentiates against those with a disease in negative social as well as biological terms. Stigma as it is portrayed in Goffman\u2019s (1963) classical description attributes blame, shame and abhorrence, particularly to marginalised groups. People gain an illusion of control by attributing risk-enhancing behaviour to the \u2018other\u2019 (Crawford 1994). Attributing medical conditions to lack of personal responsibility helps to distance the \u2018moral majority\u2019 from risk (Deacon 2005). Thus, stigmatisation can be seen as a protective response to a threat or adverse situation (Gilmore and Somerville 1994).",

According to Gilmore and Somerville (1994) the scapegoated person must be human enough to carry away the \u2018sins\u2019 of the community. The scapegoat must also be dehumanised in order to be isolated, ostracised, or in some way separated from the scapegoating community so it can expel those \u2018sins\u2019.

A major problem is that drinking and smoking tend to go hand in hand so it is difficult to disentangle the effects of the two habits (Schmidt 2008). Social gatherings where drinking and smoking take place are common sites for TB transmission (Zuger 1999) and alcohol consumption and smoking may be proxies for frequenting locations that put one at raised risk of close contact with infectious individuals (Harling et al. 2008). In their review of the medical literature, Maurya et al. (2002) found only 16 studies published between 1956 and 2002 that included the keywords \u2018smoking\u2019 and \u2018tuberculosis\u2019. The evidence from these 16 studies suggested that smoking should be considered an important risk factor for TB. The reviewers note that authors expected most drinkers to be in the TB group because of the known association between drinking and smoking: most drinkers were also smokers (Maurya et al. 2002). More recently, the multilevel analysis of South Africa\u2019s TB epidemic by Harling et al. (2008) concluded that alcohol abuse, cigarette smoking, and low body mass index each independently provided a risk factor for TB even after adjusting for the socio-economic status.",

            "text": "A pertinent question in the South African context of TB\u2013HIV co-infection is whether there is an association between drinking, smoking and HIV-infection. South Africa has a double burden of HIV and alcohol abuse (Morejele et al. 2006). Some 5.5 million in a population of approximately 48 million are HIV positive. The amount of alcohol consumed per adult is among the highest in the world (Parry 2005). Problem or binge drinking is strongly associated with the number of sexual partners a person has had and with unprotected sexual activity (Raj et al. 2009). Several recent South African studies support the link between alcohol consumption, alcohol outcome expectancies and sexually risky behaviour that are related to HIV transmission risks (Kalichman et al. 2006, 2007). However, other studies suggest youthfulness and sensation-seeking (Greene et al. 2000) and drug use (Ehrenstein et al. 2004) may need to be factored into the equation. Alcohol use before sex is consistently related to sexual risk practices and should be considered a marker for sexually transmitted infections and HIV risks (Kalichman et al. 2007). A qualitative study of bar and shebeen patrons in an urban South African setting in Gauteng Province by Morojele et al. (2006) recorded the attitudes and behaviours of drinkers and smokers in taverns and township shebeens, the licensed and unlicensed premises where liquor is sold. Fieldworkers observed that many casual sexual encounters occurred while men were drinking. Cross-generational relations between older men, so-called \u2018sugar daddies\u2019, and younger women were common in that setting. However, heavy drinking seemed to exacerbate rather than cause the sexual risk behaviours in question (Morojele et al. 2006).",

The churchgoing discussants tended to regard drinkers and smokers as lapsed Christians.

Steinberg established that there was no sound medical motivation to prohibit all ARV users from drinking. Although drinking while on medication for chronic illness was undoubtedly unadvisable, it did not impede the drug\u2019s work nor aggravate the side effects (Steinberg 2008:180). One of the medical experts Steinberg consulted on the origin of the injunction against drinking and smoking for patients on anti-retroviral treatment, spoke of a prejudice against drinkers. He intimated that AIDS counsellors were creating an exclusive church (sic) around ARVs that excluded many, particularly unemployed men, from benefiting from ARV treatment. According to the medical expert, \u201cit is important for people to believe they are part of a club, perhaps even a church. It is a sense of ubuntu.8 If you want to create a club, you must create rules\u201d (cited in Steinberg 2008:181, first emphasis added). Steinberg speculates about the significance of these rules. Apparently, it is an article of faith among many South Africans that those who smoke or drink while taking ARVs will die. He reasons that to belong to the \u2018church\u2019 created by the treatment campaigners one \u201cmust submit one\u2019s powers of discipline and restraint to the public test\u201d (Steinberg 2008:181). Thus treatment is a redemption of sorts as is \u201ccleansing your contaminated body of smoke and drink\u201d (Steinberg 2008:182). The sharp accusation of those who drank and smoked while on ARV treatment is akin to announcing that they died of contamination. Steinberg notes that \u201cperhaps it is hard to cleanse and to heal in the absence of an enemy or a scapegoat\u201d. (Steinberg 2008:182, emphasis added).",

Drawing on Steinberg\u2019s interpretation of the prohibition on drinking and smoking for people living with HIV, we conclude that drinkers and smokers may well serve as the scapegoat that will protect the Rhini community from contamination with the \u2018second\u2019 TB epidemic. Alcoholism presents a challenge to moral society in all times but even more so in the time of AIDS. It therefore lies close at hand that the church should take strong measures lest the licentiousness of drinkers and smokers pollute fellow congregants and expose them to what has been labelled a \u2018dirty\u2019 disease (Balabanova et al. 2006; Lawless et al. 1996).",

Our study of attitudes to drinking and smoking as perceived TB risk factor sought to fill the gap. The pilot study confirmed that the stigma associated with AIDS affects TB sufferers and acts as a barrier to the detection and treatment of TB (M\u00f8ller and Erstad 2007). However, results from the community survey suggested that drinkers and smokers rather than treatment defaulters might have become scapegoats that carry the stigma associated with a risky lifestyle that can spread both TB and HIV/AIDS. Although limited in scope, the follow-up focus-group study supported the thesis that drinkers and smokers are shorthand for licentiousness that presents a risk to the moral order in society. Heavy drinking and smoking was associated with shebeen drinking and the risks of contracting HIV as well as TB.",

Poverty as a structural risk-factor (Farmer 1996; Erstad 2006) was not mentioned as frequently, possibly because the participants in this study are living in poverty themselves. Although the literature has failed to establish unambiguously the bio-medical connection between drinking and smoking and TB, our study has confirmed the social connection between drinking and smoking and TB and HIV/AIDS. Shebeen patrons are portrayed as the prototypes of the drinkers and smokers whose behaviour is condemned by moral society in a time when the \u2018second\u2019 TB epidemic poses a major threat to township society. Our study, along with that of other research in the Eastern Cape, suggests that a cleansing process that involves abstinence from smoking and drinking is seen as the solution to achieve salvation from the epidemic.",
