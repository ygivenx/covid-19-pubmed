The appearance of the closely related TGEV variant porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) has been found beneficial in preventing TGEV infections, possibly through induction of neutralizing antibodies that can provide cross-protection against TGEV infection [34, 39]. However, TGE prevalence is still being reported, and some TGEV strains have been isolated from domestic pigs in different parts of the world [28]. Commercially available vaccines, either inactivated or attenuated, have failed to provide full protection to piglets [38]. It is likely that the parentally applied inactivated viruses do not induce the local immune response in the small intestine that is required for protection. Therefore, the discovery and development of new, highly potent anti-TGEV agents and effective approaches for controlling the emergence of TGEV infection remains an important mission.",

To gain insight into its possible mechanisms of action, the effects of E. faecium on viral protein synthesis as well as the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and selected cytokines were investigated. Our results described here suggest that this probiotic E. faecium strain exhibits antiviral activity against TGEV and may possibly serve as a useful antiviral agent against coronavirus infections in vivo.",

A clear increased expression of cytokines was observed, reaching the highest levels of expression at 4 hpi.

We found that E. faecium could significantly induce NO release (Table 2). The antiviral effects of NO have been well studied for several viral infections [1, 8, 15\u201317]. Although NO production is believed to be released mainly in macrophages, we did detect an increase of NO release in ST cells upon treatment with E. faecium and TGEV, and this release of NO was dose dependent. This indicates that an induction of iNOS could indeed play a role in the mechanisms for our observation that E. faecium inhibits TGEV infection in ST cells. For the competition assay, we also compared expression of the antiviral cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. TGEV infection of ST cells without E. faecium did not significantly increased expression when compared to mock control. However, E. faecium treatment significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and IL-8 in TGEV-infected ST cells. This result is consistent with those of other authors [14, 19, 25, 30, 40], who showed IL-6 or IL-8 production following the interaction of probiotics with the intestinal epithelium. Because IL-6 and IL-8 responses in intestinal epithelial cells play important roles in the pathogenesis and immune defense against enteric pathogens [21], the increased level of those cytokines could also possibly indicate an enhanced innate response.",
