Outbreaks of porcine diarrhea have been reported sequentially in pig farms in England [3], Belgium [4], Canada [5], Germany [6] and Japan [7] from 1970 to 1990. In 1984 a coronavirus strain was isolated in China and termed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [8]. PEDV viruses are taxonomically classifiable within the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales [9], and consist of a 28 kb viral genome composed of a 5\u2019 untranslated region, six open reading frames (ORF1, S, ORF3, E, M and N), and a 3\u2019 untranslated region [10].",

In 2009, outbreaks of PED were reported in most areas of Southern Vietnam [11] with the infected piglets developing severe dehydration and dying within a week. In 2010, variant-induced diarrhea broke out in China resulting in the death of 1 million piglets over 10 provinces of Southern China, with a mortality rate ranging from 80% to 100% in piglets aged younger than seven days [12]. In 2012, it was reported that the detection rate of PEDV in 12 southern provinces of china was 61.11%. In addition, a variant strain was determined using sequencing and was characterized by the presence of 9 additional bp in the S gene, when compared to CV777, including an insertion of 15 bp and a deletion of 6 bp [13]. Since 2013, there have been outbreaks of PEDV in 14 American states, with mortality rates as high as 95% [14]. In March 2016, an outbreak of diarrhea in a large pig farm in Jiangsu province, China was reported, which had a severe impact on suckling piglets. The newborn piglets developed severe watery diarrhea and vomiting within 24 h of birth, with mortality rates as high as 90%, resulting in substantial losses to the pig farm. A strain of PEDV was isolated and identified from the diarrhea samples obtained at this pig farm. In addition, gene sequencing and pathogenicity experiments were performed, with the aim of establishing a foundation for future studies of PEDV vaccines.",

The piglets were observed and recorded three times daily and humanely euthanized after the appearance of severe diarrhea or after becoming moribund. At the end of the study, all surviving piglets were euthanized humanely according to the instructions of Sinovet (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. At necropsy, different organ samples including intestine and stomach were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E). The fixed intestine sections were evaluated for PEDV antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using 200\u00d7 diluted PEDV- specific monoclonal antibody with the antigen retrieval method described previously [17]. This study was approved by the local animal ethics committee.",

Each of the sixth generations derived from the JS201603 isolate were found to be PEDV-positive via PCR. Structural analysis of the infected cells by electron microscopy confirmed that the PEDV virion was round and exhibited distinct radial projections (Fig. 1), which are typical characteristics of coronaviruses. Plaque clone purification was conducted three times and the purified virus was titrated to a titer of 104.5 TCID50/mL. Results from the immunofluorescence assay revealed that the attached fluorophore could be detected in infected Vero E6 cells, whereas none were detected in the control group (Fig. 2).\n\n",

The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3a) revealed that these PEDV strains could be divided into Subgroup I and Subgroup II. The American isolates were found to belong to Subgroup IIa, while the Chinese isolates were from Subgroup IIb. A nucleotide homology analysis indicated that the JS201603 isolate shared 93.7% to 94.4%, 96.1% to 96.4%, 98.9% to 99.0%, and 97.7% to 99% homology to Subgroup Ia, Subgroup Ib, Subgroup IIa, and Subgroup IIb, respectively. The JS201603 isolate shared the greatest homology with the IA1 [18] and BJ2011 [19] variants, and the lowest homology with the LZC isolate. The major variable region of the S gene was S1. Five typical strains, in addition to the JS201603 isolate were selected for analysis. Compared with the classical strain, CV777, the JS201603 and GDB isolates exhibited an insertion of 15 bases at 167 nt, 176 - 186 nt and 427 - 429 nt, as well as the deletion of six bases at 487 - 492 nt (Fig. 4a) [20]. The same insertions and deletions have been found in other variant strains isolated from other countries, indicating that epidemics are caused by variant strains in many countries. Moreover, the Korean vaccine DR13 isolate contained a deletion of bases at 482 - 484 nt [21]. The LC isolate [22] had an insertion of 15 bases and deletion of nine bases, and the SM98 isolate [23] exhibited a deletion of 21 bases at 4159 - 4179 nt. In comparison with the CV777 strain, some amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing region of COE (499 - 638aa) were observed, such as 558T-S, 603G-S, 614A-E, and 621L-F.

At 36 h, watery and explosive diarrhea followed, and some animals presented symptoms of vomiting after suckling. One piglet died 72 h post-challenge, while the remaining piglets were moderately depressed and curled up in the corners of their enclosure, with an associated loss of appetite. The most severe diarrhea was exhibited at 96 h post-challenge, at which time the piglets could not stand stably, and showed signs of severe emaciation and anorexia. Another piglet died at 102 h post-challenge. No abnormalities were found in the uninfected group (Fig. 5A, 5F). There was a significant decrease in weight in the infected group post-challenge, whereas the uninfected piglets gained weight. No obvious temperature changes were observed between the two groups. At necropsy, the gross lesions were found to be confined to the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by a distended stomach filled with undigested milk curd (Fig. 5B, 5G), and transparent intestine walls with the accumulation of yellowish fluids [26]. The results of the histopathologic examination revealed necrosis of scattered enterocytes followed by sloughing, the contraction of the subjacent villous lamina propria containing apoptotic cells, and a reduction in the intestinal villi compared with the controls (Fig. 5C, 5D, 5H, 5I). Immunohistochemistry for PEDV confirmed the presence of virus in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells on atrophied villi in some segments of the small intestines.

The sample was diluted to infect Vero E6 cells, with cytopathic effects appeared during the first generation of infection and continuing into later generations. PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assays indicated that the JS201603 isolate was PEDV, and no other viruses were detected. Sequence analysis of the S and ORF3 genes demonstrated that the JS201603 isolate was a variant strain. Homology analysis revealed that the JS201603 isolate shared greater homology with subgroup II than with subgroup I. Furthermore, there was no deletion of 49 nt bases in the ORF3 gene and the JS201603 isolate exhibited low homology with the vaccine strain. The results obtained using an experimental infection model suggested that the isolate could induce distinct clinical symptoms in piglets. The intestine samples were collected from a pig farm where the pigs had been previously immunized with the PEDV CV777 attenuated vaccine in August 2015 and the PEDV-TGEV live attenuated vaccine in February 2016; however, further investigation as to whether the isolate strain was derived from the recombination of vaccine strains is still required. It could be determined that the existing CV777 vaccine strain on the market exhibited lower protective efficacy against the occurrence of diarrhea. This data is consistent with the 2013 report which stated that pig farms immunized with the CV777 inactivated vaccine experienced PEDV outbreaks [19].",

In addition, most of the variable regions were concentrated at the N-terminus of the S gene. Outbreaks of diarrhea virus were reported in the US in 2013, for which phylogenetic analysis suggested that the three variant strains from the US shared the greatest homology with a diarrhea isolate obtained from Anhui province (China) in 2012 [28]. In addition, 21 counties in Japan experienced PEDV outbreaks in 2014, which caused the death of approximately 40,000 piglets. Ma.T et al, suggested that the diarrhea virus outbreak was unrelated to invalid immunity to vaccines; instead, it was found to be caused by an epidemic variant strain [29].

Thousands of piglets have died as a result of diarrhea virus infection since 2010 in China. Thus, an effective vaccine is critical to reduce the economic losses experienced within the pig breeding industry. The variant isolate characterized in this study contributes to the evolutionary analysis of diarrhea viruses. The effective experimental model of infection used in this study has established a foundation for further research on PEDV vaccine development.",
