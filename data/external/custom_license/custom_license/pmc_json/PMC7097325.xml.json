In the 2008\u20132009 flu season, almost 100% of the seasonal influenza H1N1 viruses circulating in the United States were resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and all isolates of the H3N2 viruses were resistant to adamantanes1,2,3,4,5,6. Over half of the individuals infected by the H5N1 subtype died irrespective of treatment with both classes of drug7,8,9. In our previous studies on SARS coronavirus, we demonstrated that a forward chemical genetics approach using a chemical library of 50,240 compounds with diverse structures could interrogate most known targets for viral infection10,11. Here we screened the same library using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell\u2013based influenza A infection assays and identified 950 compounds that showed protective effects as primary hits.",

Because NP failed to enter the nucleus in the presence of nucleozin, NP trapped in the cytoplasm was seen scattered randomly in host cells at 24 h after infection (Fig. 1e).

To localize the binding site of nucleozin to NP, escape virus mutants resistant to nucleozin were selected with increasing concentrations of nucleozin. We were not able to obtain escape mutants by using nucleozin as the selecting agent but an escape mutant showing cross-resistance to nucleozin was obtained after five passages of selection using compound FA-1. The resistant viral clone was plaque purified and selected for further studies. It is noteworthy that in the absence of nucleozin, the viral titer of the resistant mutant was only slightly lower than the parental virus under low (0.001) multiplicity of infection (MOI) conditions (Supplementary Fig. 7) but about an order of magnitude lower than the wild-type virus when a high MOI of 7 was used (unpublished observations). We speculate that the escape mutant virus may produce more defective interfering particles at high MOI but this observation may be applicable only to this Y289H mutant and not be generalized to other strains of influenza virus. Furthermore, although the mutant virus seemed to be less fit for infection in MDCK cells when compared with wild-type WSN virus, we caution that the fitness of a laboratory-induced mutant virus could only be meaningfully evaluated in the context of relevant animal models.",

To further confirm that the Y289H substitution was indeed the only mutation contributing to the resistant phenotype of the selected mutant virus, we used reverse genetics to create an influenza A/WSN/33 recombinant virus with a single nucleotide substitution of T with C at position 865 of the NP gene.

Results from the luciferase reporter\u2013based mini-genome assay18 further showed that concentrations of nucleozin that effectively abolished the replication of the virus had little effect on the Y289H variant NP (Fig. 2d). The results from mini-genome assays also indicated that the replication activity of the Y289H was about 20% lower than the wild-type NP, which might explain the lower NP signal in Y289H immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 2c). When we used purified recombinant wild-type NP or Y289H NP in a nuclear import assay19, the nuclear import of the wild-type NP was abolished in the presence of nucleozin (Fig. 2e), indicating that nucleozin acts on NP in the absence of other viral components. The inability of nucleozin to inhibit Y289H variant NP in nuclear import showed again that Y289H is a crucial mutation for nucleozin resistance.",

Binding of exogenous molecules is likely to induce a change in the microenvironments of tryptophan molecules leading to a change in intrinsic fluorescence. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that incubation of nucleozin with purified recombinant NP elicited a clear dose-dependent fluorescence-quenching effect, indicating that nucleozin binds to influenza A NP and that this binding may induce conformational changes in the protein. Fluorescence titration using the Y289H variant NP resulted in a much lower fluorescence-quenching effect, suggesting that the binding of nucleozin to the Y289H variant NP is much weakened but not totally abolished (Fig. 3a). The docking model (Supplementary Fig. 4) suggests that residue N309 of NP forms a hydrogen bond with nucleozin, and residue Y289 forms hydrophobic interactions with nucleozin by aromatic ring stacking. Replacement of tyrosine by histidine at position 289 presumably disrupts the ring-stacking effect and destabilizes the binding of the nucleozin to NP. As the experimental results with the Y289H mutant virus agreed with the predicted binding of nucleozin to NP, the small groove behind the body (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4) of NP is likely to be critical to the binding of nucleozin. Sequencing the NP gene of ten independent nucleozin-resistant clones from our mutant-raising experiment has shown that nine clones are Y289H mutants. One clone carried a N309K instead of the Y289H mutation. This second resistance mutation reconciles well with the original predictions of the docking model (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that N309 may stabilize the binding of nucleozin through hydrogen bonds.",

We speculate that the binding of nucleozin to influenza NP may induce conformational changes in the protein that render NP unsuitable for nuclear trafficking. Further evidence supporting our proposal that nucleozin alters the conformations of NP comes from the RNA binding experiment showing that nucleozin did not inhibit NP-RNA binding (Fig. 3b) but caused a dose-dependent reduction of NP-RNA complex that could be run into the 4\u201312% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Fig. 3b,c; lanes 3\u20136). The result suggested that nucleozin induced the formation of very large NP-RNA aggregates that were too big to get into the gradient gel during electrophoresis. The NP in the assay was not lost on account of degradation; this was apparent when we separated the reaction content by denaturing SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and detected intact NP (Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating the presence of NP aggregates that could be dissolved in denaturing conditions. In the absence of RNA, the nucleozin treatment could also reduce the amount of NP running into the native gradient gel in a dose-dependent manner as judged by the intensities of Coomassie blue\u2013stained NP in each lane (Fig. 3d, lanes 1\u20135), presumably due to formation of very large NP complexes. Separating the reaction content by denaturing SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the NP was present at comparable levels in treated and untreated samples and detectable under denaturing conditions (Supplementary Fig. 9). The data suggest that although nucleozin alone induced NP aggregate formation, the presence of RNA in the system greatly enhanced the formation of very large NP-RNA complexes nonresolvable by native electrophoresis. The Y289H variant NP, on the other hand, was inert to the addition of nucleozin, in the absence or presence of RNA (Fig. 3c, lanes 7\u201310; Fig. 3d, lanes 6\u201310).",

Without any treatment, all mice had died 7 d after inoculation. All mice survived when treated with the potent neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir (Relenza).

There was about a tenfold reduction of viral load in the lungs of the nucleozin-treated mice when compared to the untreated control group (Fig. 4b).

Among 525 Y289H variants detected in H1N1 viruses, 512 belong to the S-OIV (Supplementary Tables 1,2,3). The S-OIV has high resistance to nucleozin (EC50 > 50 \u03bcM; data not shown) in MDCK cell infection models but a close analog, compound FA-10, of nucleozin has shown promising antiviral activity against the Y289H variant and the S-OIV, with EC50 = 11.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcM and 5.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively. FA-10, however, has reduced activity toward the wild-type WSN virus, with EC50 = 15.3 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM (Supplementary Fig. 10). Molecular modeling suggests that FA-10 may bind favorably into binding site 1 of nucleozin (Supplementary Fig. 11) but the hydrogen bond formation, with NP residue N309 observed in the original nucleozin-NP binding model (Supplementary Fig. 4), is abolished, presumably leading to the reduced activity of FA-10 toward wild-type WSN virus when compared with nucleozin.

Electrostatic surface representation of influenza A NP is color-coded (red, negative; blue, positive; light gray, neutral). Potential binding sites of nucleozin are highlighted by yellow circles. (b) Escape mutant virus and recombinant virus carrying the Y289H substitution in influenza A NP confer resistance to high concentrations of nucleozin. MDCK cells were infected with A/WSN/33 virus, Y289H escape mutant virus or Y289H variant virus generated by reverse genetics. Antiviral activities determined by PRA. The highest concentration of nucleozin used was limited to 125 \u03bcM as fine precipitates appeared at higher concentration that interfered with the determination of plaques. All virus strains were tested in the same experiments for comparisons of in vitro resistance profiles. (c) MDCK cells were infected with the Y289H escape mutant virus (MOI = 5) in the presence or absence of 1 \u03bcM nucleozin. The addition of nucleozin did not block the nuclear accumulation of the viral NP. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed and DAPI staining and mouse anti-influenza A NP antibodies were used to define the locations of the nucleus and viral NP, respectively. (d) Nucleozin inhibits the parental virus NP activity but not theY289H variant virus NP in a luciferase reporter assay. 0, 1, 5 or 25 \u03bcM of nucleozin was added to 293T cells transfected with minigenomes containing A/WSN/33 virus NP or Y289H variant NP. Luciferase activities were measured 24 h post-transfection. The experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated twice. The mean value is shown with s.d. (e) Nucleozin inhibits the nuclear import of exogenously added A/WSN/33 NP but not the Y289H variant NP. Purified recombinant NP or Y289H variant NP at 25 \u03bcM was added to digitonin-treated MDCK cells in the presence or absence of 10 \u03bcM nucleozin. Nuclear import of proteins was allowed for 30 min and followed by cell fixation and immunostaining for the presence of NP in the nucleus. DAPI was used to indicate the location of the nucleus. Images were visualized by confocal microscopy.",

We used 4 \u03bcM wild-type WSN NP or Y289H variant NP and 0\u201325 \u03bcM of nucleozin for fluorescence titrations. Internal fluorescence-quenching effect was due to micro-conformational changes upon the binding of nucleozin to the NP. The experiments were carried out in duplicate and repeated three times for confirmation. (b\u2013d) Nucleozin does not inhibit RNA binding but mediates formation of large NP-RNA complexes not resolvable by gradient gel electrophoresis. Free RNA oligomer and NP-RNA complex were visualized by ethidium bromide staining in b and NP was visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 staining in c. RNA incubated with 40 \u03bcM of nucleozin in the absence of NP (lane 2) was used as a control.
