In HSCT recipients, however, the incidence of post-transplant infection, symptomatology, risk of and risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and respiratory failure are largely unknown. Furthermore, the clinical and microbiological risk factors for clinical deterioration in this population are also unknown. This information would assist clinicians in identifying HSCT recipients with HCoV infection who have the highest risk of clinical deterioration and thus warrant closer monitoring. Furthermore, these data would inform and optimize the design of future clinical trials of novel anti-HCoV therapies [4]. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of HSCT recipients at our institution who were infected with HCoV. We report the incidence, epidemiology, and outcomes of these patients, as well as the risk factors associated with progression to proven or probable LRTI.",

In this study of nearly 700 HSCT recipients, symptomatic HCoV infection occurred in 17% of patients, surpassed in incidence only by rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza infections. This cumulative incidence is consistent with the 11\u201323% incidence reported in prior studies of HSCT recipients [3, 5]. The serotype most frequently detected in our population over the duration of the study was OC43, accounting for 40% of all infections, and least common one was 229E (14%). This serotype profile is similar to what has been noted at other institutions in a wide variety of geographical locations [2, 3, 6\u20138]. Furthermore, all serotypes demonstrated winter seasonality, consistent with prior reports [3, 5].",

The high rate of proven or probable LRTI in this patient population indicates that HCoV infection may have greater clinical significance and severity in HSCT recipients than previously thought. Like prior studies, co-infection with another respiratory pathogen was common in patients with HCoV [2, 3]. In fact, 59% of patients with proven or probable LRTI harbored a co-infection with another respiratory pathogen detected on NP swab (P < 0.001). Three potential explanations for this finding are (1) HCoV infection increases susceptibility to infections by other pathogens; (2) co-infection with other respiratory pathogens increases the likelihood of progression to LRTI; or (3) co-infections increase the likelihood of obtaining chest CTs or bronchoscopies, which lead to the detection of LRTI. Importantly, we found that on subgroup analysis of those patients with a proven or probable LRTI, co-infection with another respiratory virus was not associated with respiratory failure, death at 30 days or death at 90 days, indicating that severity of a proven or probable HCoV LRTI is independent of co-infection.",

These factors may be general indicators of frailty and susceptibility for more severe infection and may highlight individuals in whom to more closely surveille and target treatment interventions in the future.

While a \u201ctest of cure\u201d is not routinely performed at our institution, patients undergo repeat NP swabs for worsening or recurrent symptoms. We found that of patients with follow-up respiratory swabs, 59% had persistent shedding of the virus, defined as shedding for \u226521 days after initial infection. No one serotype was significantly associated with persistent viral shedding, consistent with what Ogimi et al. observed in their HSCT population [12]. Additionally, the median duration of shedding in our cohort was 4 weeks, as compared to the 3 weeks described by Ogimi et al. [12]. Milano et al. found that in HSCT recipients with asymptomatic HCoV infection, the median duration of viral shedding was 4 weeks [5]. It is difficult to compare our cohort to others reported in the literature because (1) we did not screen asymptomatic individuals for infection, and (2) we did not test for persistent infection; repeat NP swab was only obtained for worsening or new respiratory symptoms. While the clinical relevance of prolonged viral shedding remains unclear, understanding the risk factors and duration of shedding has implications for infection control in this highly vulnerable population. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms and clinical significance of prolonged HCoV shedding.",

First, because it is retrospective, we may not have captured patients with mild symptoms who were not tested, leading us to underestimate the incidence of HCoV infection. The potential for missing mild cases may have also led us to overestimate the risk of progression to LRTI. However, our center had a policy of collecting NP swabs to assess for respiratory viral infection in all HSCT recipients with new respiratory symptoms during the study period. Second, only 11 patients underwent bronchoscopy, so presence or absence of HCoV in the lower respiratory tract was not discerned in most of the patients. However, given that pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis, we relied on the combination of clinical and radiographic findings to diagnose probable LRTI (13). Last, a test of cure for respiratory viruses is not standard-of-care at our institution. Therefore, only patients who had persistent symptoms or recurrent symptoms at a follow-up visit or during hospitalization underwent repeat NP swab at varying intervals. Thus, our data on persistent HCoV shedding may be underestimated, and prospective studies are needed to further evaluate this.",
