Blood samples were taken from the calves at the acute phase and 3\u20134 weeks later. In addition, 10 blood samples from cattle of different age were taken from the same herds.",

Some samples were also tested for antibodies to BVDV. ELISA-test was used for antibodies against PIV-3, BRSV, BCV and BVDV. Virus neutralization test was used for BAV-3 and BAV-7. Bacteria were cultured from lavage fluid and in vitro susceptibility for selected antimicrobials (ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin) tested. One calf was autopsied.",
