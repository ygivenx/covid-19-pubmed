This created challenges for these countries in many aspects including economic, political, social, health and so on. Some of these challenges are directly or indirectly related to information discussion, because providing the right information, at the right time and to the right audience, can solve or reduce some of the challenges. However, there were problems in this process during this crisis, as various individuals and organizations began to produce and disseminate information that, given the special circumstances of this crisis (that most countries have rarely experienced), produced types of information that are worth consideration.

A commentary may also draw attention to current advances and speculate on future directions of a certain topic (1). Accordingly, the authors of this commentary began to review scientific texts and messages published in the mass and social media on the coronavirus. Also, authors used previous knowledge and experience, particularly in the areas of health information behavior, health information literacy, and media literacy. The messages were analyzed and categorized by the authors, and the information typology was selected based on the categories of the messages and their context. In addition, the views of two other researchers on content and terms were also obtained. In this commentary, the authors attempted to take into account any information produced and published during the coronavirus crisis.",

It is important for a community to know how to manage and steer through that crisis and experts should develop appropriate behavioral patterns for both people and professional as well as government officials by gaining experience from this crisis and similar ones over the time. The proper behavioral pattern helps the community to get through the crisis with minimum cost (material and spiritual). In this behavioral pattern, attention must be paid to producers and disseminators of information, including the media, government officials, professionals in various fields (physician, nurses, psychologists, etc.) and even the public. Media professionals and medical librarians, can play an important role in finding the best behavioral model for dealing with crises due to having the necessary knowledge and awareness about information production and dissemination infrastructure and familiarity with the typology of information. In the field of prevention, teaching information literacy and health literacy, and explaining appropriate behavior in times of crisis are other actions that media professionals and medical librarians should consider. Finally, educating people on differentiating credible information from unreliable information will be the most important action taken by librarians and informants in the face of crises. It is hoped that this crisis experience will encourage medical librarians to become more active and have a more effective presence in future disasters. In conclusion, it should be mentioned that some of these types are based on the authors' understanding and inference, so everyone is welcome to help the authors improve these concepts. At the same time, lack of relevant information resources and categorization of these contents are some of the limitations of this study. Therefore, generalization of findings should be made more carefully.",
