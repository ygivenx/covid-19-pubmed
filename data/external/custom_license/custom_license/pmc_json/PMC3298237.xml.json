The primary objective is to prevent the introduction of new dengue viruses into Taiwan by travel and subsequent local spread. Dengue is classified as a reportable infectious disease, and suspected cases must be reported within 24 hours of clinical diagnosis in Taiwan. For effective surveillance, both passive (hospital-based reporting system) and active (such as health statement of inbound passengers, self-report, expanded screening for contacts of confirmed cases, patients with fever of unknown origin, school-based reporting, community screening) surveillance systems were established in central and local health departments.",

During the SARS epidemic, the body temperature of all inbound and outbound passengers at the 2 international airports was screened to prevent international spread of SARS. Since July 14, 2003, all inbound passengers have been required to complete the \u201cSARS Survey Form\u201d before landing and to have their body temperature taken by an infrared thermal camera. Any passenger showing body temperature >37\u00b0C is rechecked by ear temperature, and serum samples are collected and sent for SARS diagnosis if the ear temperature is >37.5\u00b0C. After July 5, 2003, the world was largely considered to be SARS free, and other causes of fever had to be considered; therefore, a panel of diagnostic tests, including tests for pathogens of dengue, malaria, enteric bacteria, and other diseases (such as yellow fever, plague), was performed for selected fever patients. Since dengue fever is among the top yearly imported reportable diseases in Taiwan, we began a trial fever screening program for dengue along with SARS screening at the airports.",

More than 8,000,000 inbound travelers passed through the 2 airports from July 2003 to June 2004. Among these, \u224822,000 passengers were identified as fever patients by an infrared thermal camera and rechecked by ear temperature. Diagnostic testing algorithms for screened fever patients were based on evaluation by airport clinicians. After clinical diagnosis, 3,011 serum samples were sent for laboratory diagnosis of dengue virus infection. Forty (1.33%) of 3,011 serum samples were confirmed to be positive on the basis of the results of real-time PCR and E/M-specific capture IgM and IgG ELISA. During the same period, 6,005 dengue cases were reported in Taiwan (both indigenous and imported cases), which includes 935 cases from the passive surveillance system and 5,070 cases from active surveillance systems (3,011 fever patients were identified by fever screening and 2,059 cases were identified from other systems). Among these, 73 were confirmed to be imported dengue cases, including 25 cases reported from hospitals through passive surveillance and 48 cases identified by active surveillance, such as airport screening and self-report by patients. Airport fever screening alone picked up 40 (83.3%) of 48 of all imported cases identified by the active surveillance system. Thus, 8 imported cases were identified by other active surveillance methods. The average length between the onsets of dengue symptoms to the time of diagnosis was 4.15 days for the 40 case-patients who were identified at the airport, as opposed to 11 days for those who were reported from the hospital. Whether the shorter length required to diagnose conditions identified by airport fever screening contributed to the low indigenous dengue in the season warrants further investigation.",

The countries of origin of imported dengue fever from July 2003 to June 2004 were all located in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia (Table 2). The distribution of the countries of origin accurately reflected the frequency of air travel between Taiwan and these nations, as well as the intensity of massive dengue outbreaks during the same period in the country of origin. Analyses of dengue virus serotypes showed that various serotypes were circulating in each of these countries during this period.",

Laboratory diagnoses were performed on a daily basis, and results were reported within 24 to 48 hours. Control measures were implemented as soon as possible if probable or confirmed dengue cases were identified. Since viremic persons, going about their normal activities for a mean interval of 2 to 3 days before diagnosis, could have transmitted dengue, the laboratory detection method on its own will not be effective in preventing transmission. Therefore, developing an integrated program that includes various surveillance systems, rapid diagnostic laboratories, and emergency control measures is necessary to prevent the introduction and spread of new dengue viruses into a region. Control measures should consist of epidemiologic investigation, health education, analysis of mosquito density, source reduction, and insecticide application. As part of an integrated dengue control program, fever screening at the airport has become one of the most important active surveillance systems in Taiwan since its introduction in July 2003. We believed that this active surveillance system could also be successfully applied to screen febrile patients and reduce the introduction of many potential infectious diseases.",
