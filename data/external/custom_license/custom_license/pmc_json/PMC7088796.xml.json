Additionally, H. somni is one of the bacterial pathogens associated with the clinical entity known as bovine respiratory disease of feedlot cattle (Divers 2008) and is a normal habitat of the reproductive and respiratory mucus membranes of asymptomatic cattle (Harris and Janzen 1989; Corbeil 2007; Woolums et al. 2009). Furthermore, based on sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes, it was proposed that the organisms referred to as Haemophilus somni, Haemophilus agni, and Histophilus ovis are in fact H. somni and should represent a novel genus within the Pasteurellaceae family (Angen et al. 2003). However, differences between ovine and bovine strains of H. somni have been identified (Tanaka et al. 2005) .",

Nevertheless, H. somni has also been isolated from healthy goats in Mexico (Perez-Romero et al. 2011) and Hungary (Janosi et al. 2009a) and has been associated TME in sheep within Europe (Cassidy et al. 1997), reproductive disease in sheep from Canada (Lees et al. 1990), and in one case of endometritis in a sheep from Brazil (Rizzo et al. 2012). Furthermore, H. somni-induced infections are more predominant in young cattle (Harris and Janzen 1989; Van Donkersgoed et al. 1990) and in feedlot relative to dairy and pastured animals (Fecteau and George 2004), occurring within the first 2 weeks or months of the feeding period (Woolums et al. 2009).",

Consequently, due to the large number of organs/tissue that can be affected, manifestations of H. somni-induced infections in cattle are directly related to the organ and/or system infected (Harris and Janzen 1989; Woolums et al. 2009). Nevertheless, vasculitis and thrombosis due to endothelial cell damage are the predominant pathological features of H. somni-induced infections (Harris and Janzen 1989; Divers 2008).

The clinical signs observed were not common within the farms and varied between sudden death (farms A and B), reproductive problems (farm C), and gastrointestinal manifestations (farm D). Animals at farms A and B demonstrated predominantly neurological manifestations. Reproductive complaints included infertility, 20 abortions, and a reduced conception rate (35 %). Most calves at farm D had a clinical diagnosis of coccidiosis and suffered from intermittent diarrhea during the last few months. All cattle were reared on pasture; water and commercial mineral salts were administered ad libitum.\n",

Additional confirmation of the participation of H. somni in the etiopathogenesis of these manifestations was obtained by the successful amplification of the 16S rRNA gene of this bacterium from tissue fragments of all animals evaluated; similar results have been described (Angen et al. 1998, 2003).

Although TME is a common neurological manifestation of histophilosis (Fecteau and George 2004; George 2009), studies have suggested that systemic histophilosis is more frequently diagnosed relative to TME (Harris and Janzen 1989; Van Donkersgoed et al. 1990). Furthermore, most of these calves had pulmonary disease, which might be the source of dissemination in these cases (Harris and Janzen 1989; Fecteau and George 2004; P\u00e9rez et al. 2010). The hepatic abscess observed in animal no. 3 and multiple renal infarctions of animal no. 5 were previously described in systemic histophilosis (P\u00e9rez et al. 2010). The wedge-shaped patterns observed grossly associated with the histopathological findings are characteristic of infarction due to obstruction of the interlobular artery. The finding of thrombi within several organs of these animals is a frequent manifestation of systemic histophilosis (Momotani et al. 1985). Although the pathogenesis of H. somni-induced infections is not well elucidated and is very complex (Corbeil 2007), the disseminated vasculitis observed during this study has been associated with several virulence factors such as lipooligosaccharide, immunoglobulin-binding proteins, major outer membrane proteins, histamine production, and exopolysaccharide (Corbeil 2007; P\u00e9rez et al. 2010). However, apoptotic cell death of endothelial cells caused by this bacterium might be the key to explain thrombosis in histophilosis (Corbeil 2007; Woolums et al. 2009; P\u00e9rez et al. 2010).",

Alternatively, the principal pathogens associated with diarrhea in calves are BCoV, BoRV-A, BVDV, Clostridium perfringens-induced enterotoxemia, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. (Gunn et al. 2009).

The age of the calves (5\u201360 days) on the farm with diarrhea is not consistent with that associated of infections by E. coli (Gunn et al. 2009), while the histopathological manifestations characteristic of salmonellosis were not observed. However, the pathological enteric findings of these calves are similar with those associated with C. perfringens type A enterotoxemia (Gunn et al. 2009). Consequently, these diarrheic calves might have been simultaneously infected with H. somni and C. perfringens.\n",

Although congenital babesiosis has been described in calves that have not received colostrum (Bracarense et al. 2001), rapid staining of the affected cerebral cortex did not reveal hemoparasites, and characteristic histopathological alterations associated with B. bovis were not observed. Additionally, the pathogenesis of bovine babesiosis is incompatible with the age (1 day) of this calf because of the following: (1) clinical manifestations of bovine babesiosis occurs 2 to 3 weeks after tick infestation; (2) the incubation period varies from 5 days to around 3 weeks; and (3) calves in endemic areas, as was this animal, have a natural immunity to babesiosis, which is reinforced by colostral antibodies (Zaugg 2009). Consequently, cerebral babesiosis was excluded as part of the etiopathogenesis associated with this manifestation, but it is proposed that cerebral histophilosis be included as differential diagnosis in cases of cerebral cortical congestion in cattle, particularly in young animals.",

Furthermore, confirmation of the participation of H. somni in these lesions was achieved by the direct sequencing of these amplicons, while the absence of a H. somni-positive control excluded possible contamination. A positive H. somni control was not included due to the availability of a reliable control DNA, considering that there is only one case description of this disease within Brazil. The sequences from this study clustered with other bovine sequences from other geographical locations, while those derived from sheep formed a somewhat separate cluster. These findings are in accordance with the theory that ovine and bovine H. somni sequences clustered separately and can be differentiated by analyses of the H. somni rpoB gene (Tanaka et al. 2005). Furthermore, all H. somni sequences formed a cluster that was distinct from other members of the Pasteurellaceae family, confirming the genus differentiation proposed (Angen et al. 2003) .",

Additionally, all diarrheic calves treated with oxytetracycline recovered completely; this is important in associating the participation of H. somni-induced disease in the diarrheic animals since oxytetracycline is the drug of choice for H. somni-induced infections (Harris and Janzen 1989; Fecteau and George 2004; George 2009; Woolums et al. 2009), and standing animals medicated during the progression of histophilosis are known to recover (Harris and Janzen 1989; Woolums et al. 2009). Although other common pathogens were not identified in these animals, the possible participation of a non-evaluated viral or bacterial agent cannot be completely excluded as stressor associated with the development of systemic histophilosis. Since only one aborted fetus from farm C and one calf was affected at farm D, whole blood was collected from other calves of similar age range and from the cow of the aborted fetus and cows with history of abortion from farm C, in an attempt to identify additional bacteremic calves at the first location and the source of infection at the latter. However, all of these samples from farms C and D were negative for H. somni; this suggests that these animals were not bacteremic, but the PCR-negative cows could have been asymptomatic carriers (P\u00e9rez et al. 2010) and the source of infection at the farm with a history of abortion.",

The animals of most farms are reared exclusively on pastures; H. somni is more frequently diagnosed in feedlot cattle (Fecteau and George 2004). Nevertheless, since these infections occurred at farms from distinct areas and that there was no movement of cattle between the affected farms, the authors believe that this bacterium was always present within the Brazilian cattle herds but was never diagnosed or the possibility of H. somni-induced infections, investigated. This might be because the diverse clinical manifestations associated with H. somni, as observed in these cases, can be easily confused with other diseases (such as bovine viral diarrhea; infectious bovine rhinotracheitis; rotavirus and coronavirus enteritis; herpesvirus-induced meningoencephalitis; and malignant catarrhal fever) that are more frequently associated with cattle mortality in Brazil. Consequently, it is recommended that H. somni be included in the list of differentials to investigate livestock mortality in Brazil and South America, since this pathogen was previously diagnosed in a sheep with endometritis from Brazil (Rizzo et al. 2012) and sporadic outbreaks have occurred in Argentina (Descarga et al. 2002).",
