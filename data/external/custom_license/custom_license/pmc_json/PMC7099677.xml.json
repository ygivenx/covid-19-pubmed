These infectious viruses have been identified as\nhemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), novel coronaviruses including severe\nacute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome\nMERS-CoV), and highly pathogenic influenza. Coronaviruses (CoVs), as a class of\nenveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, cause various diseases in\nhumans. CoVs are subdivided into four groups: Alphacoronavirus,\nBetacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV),\nGammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus.\nTwo novel \u03b2CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS- CoV) and\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have recently emerged and can\ninduce a high mortality. The current outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19\n(HCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO)\ndeclaring this outbreak a global pandemic. By March 15, 2020, infected cases had\nreached 81 048 in China and a total of 72 600 cases outside China\nhave been reported to the WHO from 146 countries and territories (https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd).",
