            "text": "To date, there is still a variety of human diseases with unknown etiology. A viral origin has been suggested for many of these diseases, emphasizing the importance of a continuous search for new viruses1,2,3. Major difficulties are encountered, however, when searching for new viruses. First, some viruses do not replicate in vitro, at least not in the cells that are commonly used in viral diagnostics. Second, for those viruses that do replicate in vitro and cause a cytopathic effect (CPE), the subsequent virus identification methods may fail. Antibodies raised against known viruses may not recognize the cultured virus, and virus-specific PCR methods may not amplify the new viral genome. To solve both problems, we developed a new method for virus discovery based on the cDNA-amplified restriction fragment\u2013length polymorphism technique (cDNA-AFLP4). Here we report the identification of a new coronavirus using this method of Virus-Discovery-cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA).",

The genomic RNA is 27\u201332 kb in size, capped and polyadenylated. Three serologically distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described. Within each group, viruses are characterized by their host range and genome sequence. Coronaviruses have been identified in mice, rats, chickens, turkeys, swine, dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, cattle and humans, and can cause a variety of severe diseases including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract diseases5,6. Three human coronaviruses have been studied in detail. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were identified in the mid-1960s, and are known to cause the common cold7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. The recently identified SARS-CoV causes a life-threatening pneumonia, and is the most pathogenic human coronavirus identified thus far16,17,18. SARS-CoV is likely to reside in an animal reservoir, and has recently initiated the epidemic in humans through zoonotic transmission19,20. It has been suggested that SARS-CoV is the first member of a fourth group of coronaviruses, or that it is an outlier of group 2 (refs. 21, 22).",

Diagnostic tests for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, rhinovirus, enterovirus, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 yielded negative results. The clinical sample was subsequently inoculated onto human fetal lung fibroblasts, tertiary monkey kidney cells (Cynomolgus monkey) and HeLa cells. CPE was detected exclusively on tertiary monkey kidney cells, and was first noted 8 d after inoculation. The CPE was diffuse, with a refractive appearance in the affected cells followed by cell detachment. More pronounced CPE was observed upon passage onto the monkey kidney cell line LLC-MK2, with overall cell rounding and moderate cell enlargement (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Additional subcultures on human fetal lung fibroblasts, rhabdomyosarcoma cells and Vero cells remained negative for CPE. Immunofluorescence assays to detect respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 remained negative. Acid lability and chloroform sensitivity tests indicated that the virus was most likely enveloped, and did not belong to the picornavirus group23.",

To overcome this problem, we developed the VIDISCA method based on the cDNA-AFLP technique4. The advantage of VIDISCA is that prior knowledge of the sequence is not required, as the presence of restriction enzyme sites is sufficient to guarantee PCR amplification. The input sample can be either blood plasma or serum, or culture supernatant. Whereas cDNA-AFLP starts with isolated mRNA, VIDISCA begins with a treatment to selectively enrich for viral nucleic acid, including a centrifugation step to remove residual cells and mitochondria (Fig. 1a). A DNase treatment is also used to remove interfering chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA from degraded cells (viral nucleic acid is protected within the viral particle). Finally, by choosing frequently cutting restriction enzymes, the method can be fine-tuned such that most viruses will be amplified. We were able to amplify viral nucleic acids in EDTA-treated plasma from a person with hepatitis B viral infection, and from a person with an acute parvovirus B19 infection (Fig. 1b). The technique can also detect HIV-1 in cell culture, demonstrating its capacity to identify both RNA and DNA viruses (Fig. 1b).",

To address this question, we used two diagnostic RT-PCR assays to examine respiratory specimens of hospitalized individuals and those visiting the outpatient clinic between December 2002 and August 2003 (Fig. 2). We identified seven additional individuals carrying HCoV-NL63 (Table 1). Sequence analysis of the PCR products indicated the presence of a few characteristic point mutations in several samples, suggesting that several viruses with different molecular markers may be cocirculating (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3 online). At least five of the HCoV-NL63-positive individuals suffered from respiratory tract illness; the clinical data of two individuals was not available. Including the index case, five of the patients were children less than 1 year old, and three patients were adults. Two adults were likely to be immunosuppressed, as one of them was a bone marrow transplant recipient and the other an HIV-positive patient suffering from AIDS, with very low CD4+ cell counts (Table 1). No clinical data was available for the third adult. One patient was coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (no. 72), and the HIV-infected patient (no. 466) carried Pneumocystis carinii. No other respiratory agent was found in the other patients, suggesting that the respiratory symptoms were caused by HCoV-NL63. All positive samples were collected during the last winter season, with a detection frequency of 7% in January 2003. None of the 306 samples collected in the spring and summer of 2003 contained HCoV-NL63 (P < 0.01 by two-tailed t test).",

Thus far, only three human coronaviruses have been characterized if we include SARS-CoV; further characterization of HCoV-NL63 as the fourth member will provide important insight into the variation among human coronaviruses. HCoV-NL63 is a member of the group 1 coronaviruses and is most closely related to HCoV-229E, but the differences between them are prominent. First, they share on average only 65% sequence identity. Second, a single gene, ORF3, in HCoV-NL63 takes the place of the 4A and 4B genes of HCoV-229E. Third, the 5\u2032 region of the S gene of HCoV-NL63 contains a large in-frame insertion of 537 nucleotides. The N-terminal region of the S protein has been implicated in binding to aminopeptidase N (group I coronaviruses) and sialic acid31,32,33, so the 179\u2013amino acid insert in HCoV-NL63 might be involved in receptor binding and may explain the tropism of this virus in cell culture. However, the aminopeptidase N receptor-binding domain of the HCoV-229E S protein has been mapped to amino acids (407\u2013547 ref. 33), so it seems unlikely that the insertion will be directly involved in binding to aminopeptidase N. Fourth, whereas HCoV-229E is fastidious in cell culture with a narrow host range, HCoV-NL63 replicates efficiently in monkey kidney cells. SARS-CoV is also able to replicate in monkey kidney cells (Vero-E6 cells34), yet the predicted S proteins of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 do not share a domain that could explain the in vitro host cell range of these viruses. Other viral proteins may influence the cell tropism of a virus, but none of the HCoV-NL63 proteins were more closely related to SARS-CoV than to HCoV-229E.",

These porcine viruses are antigenically and genetically related, but their pathogenicity is markedly different. TGEV replicates in and destroys the enterocytes of the small intestine, causing severe diarrhea with high mortality in neonatal swine. In contrast, PRCoV (which emerged more recently than TGEV) has a selective tropism for respiratory tissue, and very little capacity to replicate in intestinal tissue. The difference between the TGEV and PRCoV S gene sequences is comparable to the difference between those of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E35. Compared with TGEV, PRCoV contains a deletion in the 5\u2032 hypervariable region of the S gene.

To date, no known viral pathogen can be identified in a substantial portion of respiratory disease cases in humans (20\u201330%; ref. 38). Several assays have been used to diagnose coronavirus infections. Traditionally, an antibody test is implemented to measure a rise in titers of antibodies to the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 (ref. 12). Antibodies to HCoV-NL63 might cross-react with HCoV-229E, given that these viruses are members of the same serotype. If this were the case, HCoV-NL63 infections might have been misdiagnosed as HCoV-229E. Molecular biology tools such as RT-PCR assays39,40 were designed to selectively detect the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, but these assays will not detect HCoV-NL63. Even the RT-PCR assay that was designed to amplify all known coronaviruses40 is not able to amplify HCoV-NL63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences.

The virus was not detected in more recent samples collected in the spring and summer of 2003, which correlates with the fact that human coronaviruses tend to be transmitted predominantly in the winter season12. Future experiments with more sensitive diagnostic tools should yield a more accurate picture of the prevalence of this virus and its association with respiratory disease.",

MseI and HinP1I anchors (see below) were subsequently added, along with 5U ligase enzyme (Invitrogen) in the supplied ligase buffer, for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The MseI and HinP1I anchors were prepared by mixing a top-strand oligonucleotide (5\u2032-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC-3\u2032 for the MseI anchor and 5\u2032-GACGATGAGTCCTGAC-3\u2032 for the HinP1I anchor) with a bottom-strand oligonucleotide (5\u2032-TAGGTACGCAGTC-3\u2032 for the MseI anchor and 5\u2032-CGGTCAGGACTCAT-3\u2032 for the HinP1I anchor) in a 1:40 dilution of ligase buffer. Twenty cycles of PCR were carried out with 10 \u03bcl of the ligation mixture, 100 ng of HinP1I standard primer (5\u2032-GACGATGAGTCCTGACCGC-3\u2032) and 100 ng of MseI standard primer (5\u2032-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACCTAA-3\u2032). Five microliters of this PCR product was used as input in the second 'selective' amplification step, along with 100 ng HinP1I N-primer and 100 ng MseI N-primer (the 'N' indicates that the standard primers were extended with one nucleotide; G, A, T or C). The selective rounds of amplification were done using 'touchdown PCR': 10 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 60 s, 65 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min (annealing temperature reduced by 1 \u00b0C per cycle); 23 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; and finally 1 cycle of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Sixteen PCR reactions, each with 1 of the 16 primer combinations, were conducted for each sample in this selective PCR. The PCR products were analyzed on 4% Metaphor agarose gels (Cambrex), and the fragments of interest were cloned and sequenced using BigDye terminator reagents. Electrophoresis and data collection were performed using an ABI 377 instrument. DNA molecular weight markers were from Invitrogen and Eurogentec.",
