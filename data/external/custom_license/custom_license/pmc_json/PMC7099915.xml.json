Although based on very small numbers of patients, the mortality among EVD patients managed in these units was 18 % during the West African outbreak [1\u2022\u2022], compared to a case-fatality rate of 70 % among all patients and 64 % among patients managed in conventional hospitals (albeit in resource-poor African nations) [2]. In this paper, we discuss briefly the history of infection control and laboratory biosafety before chronicling the fascinating history of these HLCC units, as well as the high-level containment transport systems utilized to deliver patients to these units.",

In 1847, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician, postulated a link between the contaminated hands of physicians and the development of puerperal fever among their patients. By imposing mandatory hand washing, he reduced peri-partum maternal mortality from 18 to 2 %. In the 1860s, Louis Pasteur began to advocate for the use of boric acid as an antiseptic and hospital disinfectant, and in the 1870s, Joseph Lister employed carbolic acid in a similar manner. In 1897, Paul Berger, a French surgeon, was credited with first donning a surgical mask, and in 1943, Barnes Hospital in St. Louis opened the first dedicated isolation ward [5]. Detailed histories of the growth and maturation of the science of infection control [2, 6] are published elsewhere.",

These measures and refinements serve multiple purposes: (1) they protect the patient by offering care in a unique, self-contained unit typically staffed by selected individuals with expertise in critical care and infectious diseases; (2) they protect families by removing difficult decisions about visitation (which is typically not permitted in biocontainment units); (3) they protect other patients from the potential threat of contagion; (4) they protect the laboratory worker who may be required to handle specimens containing some of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens; (5) they protect the community by offering an additional level of assurance; and, finally, (6) they protect the healthcare worker. Such protection is critical in view of nosocomial risk during the 2014\u20132015 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak, during which at least 815 healthcare workers acquired the disease [7]. Similarly, the World Health Organization reports that, during that same outbreak, healthcare workers were 21\u201332 times more likely to acquire Ebola infection than the general population [8].",

            "text": "In this paper, we will briefly discuss laboratory biocontainment before focusing on clinical biocontainment, or HLCC, the latter consisting of two components: definitive care and transport to that care. In 1951, Pike and Sulkin published one of the first surveys of laboratory-acquired infection [9], and in 1955, at Camp Detrick (now Fort Detrick), Maryland, the first meeting of what would later become the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) was held [10]. In 1964, Arnold Wedum, Director of Health and Safety at the Fort Detrick-based Army Biological Laboratory (ABL), drawing upon ABSA discussions, published some of the earliest comprehensive guidance on microbiologic safety, offering recommendations on protocols and procedures, laboratory construction and equipping, the employment of biosafety cabinets, animal handling and caging, and other facility and personnel safeguards [11]. Over the next two decades, growing CDC, NIH, and OSHA participation in ABSA annual meetings further solidified biosafety guidelines, culminating in the 1984 publication of the first edition of the text, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL). The BMBL guidelines laid out four levels of increasingly intensive safety practices, equipment, facilities, and engineering controls to be employed in the safe handling of microbial agents: Biosafety Levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BSL-1, -2, -3, and -4), with BSL-4 being the highest (or \u201cmaximum\u201d) containment. At this level, the person is physically separated from the agent using either a glove box (class III biosafety cabinet) or by wearing a fully encapsulating (\u201cspace\u201d) suit. At that time, the CDC and USAMRIID possessed the only BSL-4 laboratories in the USA but, with an increased emphasis on (and funding for) counter-bioterror research following the terror attacks of 2001, these facilities have proliferated in recent years; as many as 13 are currently in operation or under construction. Similarly, as many as 200 BSL-3 laboratories operate within the USA, with most located at universities and State Health Departments.",

            "text": "Biocontainment, as the term is widely understood today, is most often applied to the clinical care setting, where the concept of HLCC derived in large part from four separate events which took place in 1969:In May, Michael Crichton published his novel, The Andromeda Strain. While the work was clearly fictional, it captivated the public and thus caught the attention of political and media leaders. Moreover, it was followed by at least three important real-world events which heightened this attention:In July, Neal Armstrong and \u201cBuzz\u201d Aldrin first set foot on the lunar surface, carried there aboard Apollo 11. In order to protect against the remote possibility of these astronauts introducing extraterrestrial pathogens to the earth upon their return, a new facility, the Lunar Receiving Laboratory (LRL), was designed in consultation with experts from Fort Detrick\u2019s ABL and constructed at the Johnson Manned Spaceflight Center in Houston, Texas. This facility would receive spacecraft, equipment, and lunar samples from Apollo 11 (as well as future Apollo missions) and would also serve as a quarantine facility, housing astronauts for 21 days following their return. The LRL employed myriad novel engineering controls, including protective isolation garments with high-level respirators, chemical treatment of waste and shower effluent, submersible \u201ctransfer-lock\u201d pass-boxes, and serial negative pressure gradation.In November, following many months of discussion and internal negotiation, amidst significant media attention occurring in conjunction with renewed interest in the ratification of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and despite the continued existence of a massive extant, though unrecognized, Soviet weapons program, President Richard Nixon unilaterally renounced the use of offensive biological weapons. He noted that they \u201chave massive, unpredictable, and potentially uncontrollable consequences [12].\u201d Nixon went on to state that \u201cthe United States has decided to destroy its entire stockpile of biological agents and confine its future biological research program to defensive measures.\u201d This newfound defensive posture would include an emphasis on the management of patients potentially infected with highly hazardous human pathogens to minimize secondary cases.Finally, Dr. Jordi Casals-Ariet, a professor at Yale University, discovered a new arenavirus in 1969 that he named Lassa after the town in Nigeria from which his index patient originated [13]. Dr. Casals contracted Lassa fever himself while studying the virus and fell critically ill. He ended up receiving convalescent serum from one of his patients. Unfortunately, one of his technicians succumbed to laboratory-acquired Lassa fever in December. As a result, Dr. Casals moved his research activities to a new maximum-security laboratory at the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta (the predecessor of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)). A new era of laboratory safety had thus begun.\n",

After Nixon\u2019s 1969 pronouncement, the building was repurposed as a medical institute, and its name was changed to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). Inside the facility, a two-bed state-of-the-art HLCC unit was outfitted. This unit, often referred to as \u201cthe Slammer,\u201d presumably owing to the ominous sound (and, perhaps, the sense of forboding) produced by the closure of its heavy steel air-lock doors, opened in 1971. This facility included engineering controls analogous to those employed in BSL-4 laboratories. Not only would the Slammer provide a facility in which to treat infected patients, it would also a lend a sense of security to scientists studying some of the world\u2019s most dangerous pathogens, and to the surrounding community of Frederick, Maryland (where Fort Detrick is located). Scientists potentially exposed in the field or through a laboratory mishap were promised monitoring in the modern facility while the community was assured that infected individuals would not intermingle with the citizenry.",

Although the majority of exposures had occurred in the laboratory involving Lassa, Machupo, or Junin virus, two of these exposures occurred in the field. Following a 19-year hiatus, an additional patient [15] (exposed to Ebola in the laboratory) was admitted in 2004. Remarkably, none of the 21 patients became ill or otherwise demonstrated evidence of infection and all were discharged from the facility after periods of observation extending to the upper limits of the relevant pathogens\u2019 incubation periods.",

The emergence, in the spring of 2003, of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a novel, highly lethal, and apparently very contagious disease caused by a newly discovered Coronavirus and transmitted via the airborne route added impetus to those discussions, as did a near-simultaneous outbreak of Monkeypox in the upper Midwest. The latter was ultimately linked to the importation of Gambian giant rats and was particularly problematic in that some physicians, fearful of becoming infected, refused to treat infected patients [16]. In response to these developments, civilian and academic leaders at Emory University in Atlanta and at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha embarked upon a program to create HLCC units at their institutions. Emory\u2019s two-bed unit, intended, in part, to house infected scientists from the adjacent CDC, and Nebraska\u2019s ten-bed unit, opened in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The facilities employed some (but not all) of the engineering controls contained within the USAMRIID facility (Fig. 1). In 2006, leaders from the three facilities published the first consensus guidelines for the employment of these units [17\u2022\u2022].\n",

Biocontainment units in Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands [19], Norway, Switzerland, and Italy also successfully cared for expatriate patients during the recent EVD outbreak; the mortality rate among patients treated under HLCC conditions in western nations was 18 %, comparing favorably to historical mortality rates of 50\u201390 % [1\u2022\u2022]. In addition, other European nations possess HLCC capacity [20], and Europe has been a pioneer in the development of HLCC doctrine [21, 22]. China, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, constructed a 1000-bed infectious disease treatment facility equipped with engineering controls designed to ameliorate the risk of airborne transmission of the SARS-coronavirus [23]. Singapore and South Korea are currently constructing HLCC facilities, and several Middle Eastern states are exploring this possibility.",

In the case of Apollo 11, the MQF, positioned aboard the space capsule recovery ship USS Hornet, housed the three astronauts, along with a physician and cook, for a period of 88 h until they could be transferred to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.

Shortly thereafter, they commissioned Vickers Medical Limited of England to develop isolators based on Trexler\u2019s technology that could be transported aboard a Boeing 707 aircraft and utilized for intra- or international patient transport. The Canadians had an opportunity to employ their air-transportable isolator (ATI) in 1977, when they moved a 6-year-old boy suspected of having Lassa fever from Toronto to their National Defense Medical Center in Ottawa [28]. Meanwhile, there are reports that an ill US Peace Corps worker assumed to have been infected with Ebola virus while working in Zaire was transported from Kinshasa to Johannesburg in 1976 in an ATI provided by the CDC (and presumably procured from Vickers) [30, 31]. Interestingly, the Royal Free Hospital in London (which successfully managed three patients with EVD in 2014\u201315) also envelopes patients in a Trexler isolator designed to fit around their standard hospital bed [32].",

Two such modules can be loaded aboard military evacuation airframes. The CBCS is a rigid, fully-containerized system which can contain four patients and four caregivers during lengthy transport missions. In the longer term, developments in vaccinology, detection, diagnostics, and therapeutics will undoubtedly assist in mitigating the threats that now prompt us to resort to HLCC.
