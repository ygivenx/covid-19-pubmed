Different types of models have also been developed, from the early differential equation compartmental model to more recent large-scale individual-based stochastic models (Bobashev et al. 2007). Despite insightful findings provided, those models usually consider the complex issue without its crucial social or human factors. They often assume that, individuals do not change their behaviors during an influenza pandemic but continue with regular activities (Yoo et al. 2010). Empirical studies, however, have reported different phenomena. Many individuals when confronted with a pandemic undertake actions (e.g., wearing face masks and washing hands more frequently) to protect themselves (Lau et al. 2007). Those self-protective actions could reduce their probabilities of infection, and largely change the spread dynamics of the pandemic, particularly at the beginning of its outbreak (Ekberg et al. 2009).",

The first approach assumes all individuals reducing their social contacts for self-protection (e.g., Yoo et al. 2010). Simulation models based on this assumption tend to underestimate pandemic impacts, since there are still lots of people who behave as normal and do not adopt any preventive measure during a pandemic (Lau et al. 2003, 2010). The second simulation approach considers the heterogeneity in individuals\u2019 behavioral responses. But models adopting this approach are usually extensions or modifications of the classic compartmental model for influenza pandemic simulation (e.g., Zhong et al. 2013). Limitations inherent in compartmental models, such as the homogenous population assumption, still constrain the utility of the model.",

It then explains how risk communication and individual responsive behavior are incorporated in an agent-based model. The study further conducts simulation experiments to show the influences of those social components on influenza spread dynamics, and sensitivity analyses of uncertain parameters.

Relevant modeling efforts have also realized its importance and developed two approaches to achieve this purpose. The first approach is to introduce the concept of prevalence elastic behavior into simulation models, which refers to the adaptive actions people take in response to an epidemic (Philipson 2000; Philipson and Posner 1993). Individuals in these models are assumed to reduce their overall contacts with other people due to a pandemic, and the degree of reduction depends on the epidemic\u2019s propagation condition. This assumption is also called the mass action incidence assumption (Larson and Nigmatulina 2010). For example, both Larson and Nigmatulina (2009) and Yoo et al. (2010) make the parameter of daily contact rate in their models a variable instead of a constant. The value for this parameter is less than the average normal-day contact rate and varies during the simulation with the size of remaining non-infected population.",

They neglect the heterogeneity in human responses to pandemic situations. According to public risk communication literature, people in emergency contexts could receive risk information. Risk information informs them of potential threats and available self-protective actions, and initiates their reaction processes to the situation (Donner 2006). This reaction process is highly social and complex. It generally consists of several sequential stages (Quarantelli 1990). Upon receiving risk information, individuals develop their interpretations of the message and formulate their understandings on whether the risk communicated is real. They then seek additional information mainly from their personal contacts to verify their understandings, and define their own situations regarding whether they are personally endangered.",

They could respond in a variety of ways, depending upon the cognitive choices and interaction results with others they make at each stage of the process. For example, if individuals do not interpret the information received as a warning message of some risk, or not believe the risk, they would ignore it and continue with their routine activities (Donner et al. 2007). Same responses occur when they cannot confirm the risk through personal contacts or do not consider themselves as targets of the risk (Parker et al. 2009). Previous studies also find that, individuals under some circumstances tend to take certain actions not necessarily providing protections (e.g., Donner 2007). Therefore, not all individuals respond as expected by taking self-protective actions. They may choose to do so only when the risk information is received, correctly understood and believed, socially confirmed and personalized.",

This number still remained high ( 40%) even after the local health authority initiated vigorous communitywide SARS preventive activities. Later studies likewise find a large percentage of individuals not taking self-protective actions during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak in China (e.g., Lau et al. 2009), in England (e.g., Rubin et al. 2009), in Saudi Arabia (e.g., Balkhy et al. 2010), and in India (e.g., Kamate et al. 2009).

The latter maintain their constant normal-day contact rates throughout the simulation. Those modifications enable individuals in different compartments to have varying responsive behaviors.

The interpersonal interaction structure remains absent as in the classic compartmental model (Galante et al. 2015).

The degrees of connectivity follow a right-skewed distribution, with a mean of 11 and a much smaller median of 4. Meanwhile, the network is assumed to be stable over time, given that the turnover of a friendship connection is slow relative to the timescale of a pandemic (Keeling and Eames 2005). But when some individual dies, it and all its connections would be removed from the environment, while the rest part of the network remains unchanged.",

As shown in Table 2, the peak prevalence is reduced to 3.56% on November 4, 2009 (32nd time step), and the epidemic size to 26.69% by the end of the influenza season. Those two indicators are respectively reduced by 44.63 and 42.99%, compared with the scenario of no public intervention. Meanwhile, the epidemic duration is prolonged. No newly infected individuals have been found since April 1, 2010 (180th time step). The extended epidemic duration, together with decreased peak prevalence and epidemic size, gains more time for public managers to respond to the situation.\n\n",

For example, many studies consider individuals\u2019 voluntary action of reducing their social contacts an effective means to control the SARS spread (e.g., WHO 2003). Individual responsive behavior thus becomes an integral component of influenza modeling. On the other hand, people respond to pandemic situations in a complex way.

Second, the human behavioral component requires more accurate representation in the simulation. Agent-based modeling among other influenza modeling methods is more appropriate to implement the approach. Barrat et al. (2008) summarize another three distinct methods. Homogeneous mixing and multi-scale models assume a homogeneous random mixing of people and cannot incorporate heterogeneities. Social structure models fail to consider interpersonal contact patterns, and none of the three types of models could include responsive behavior at the individual level.",

Previous studies have also widely supported its effectiveness in pandemic spread containment (e.g., Vaughan and Tinker 2009). Our simulation results indicate that public risk communication and individuals\u2019 self-protective actions could greatly reduce the pandemic impact, and help buy time to introduce other public interventions, particularly the production and distribution of enough vaccines for the general public.

            "text": "Despite those limitations, this study addresses one critical challenge in influenza pandemic simulation. It proposes an agent-based simulation framework by synthesizing knowledge from public risk communication, epidemiology, social network and social influence theory, and both quantitative and qualitative data found in previous studies. The model developed could properly integrate human behavioral response into pandemic-related estimates, and more accurately anticipate the spread dynamics of an influenza, particularly when pharmaceutical measures are not readily available. With further verification and validation, it could serve as an exploration instrument in decision-making process to carry out comprehensive evaluations of intervention strategy choices and help select appropriate pandemic control measures. This study therefore also contributes to the discussion of improving the effectiveness of pandemic preparedness and response in a dynamic environment.",
