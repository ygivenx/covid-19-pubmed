Among these, the surface protein S, which is also an integral membrane protein, is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies in a host. It mediates the attachment of viral particles to host cells via binding to the cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) before cell invasion [6, 7]. Consequently, the S protein could be an excellent target for therapeutics that can block viral entry or vaccines that induce protective immunity against TGEV [8]. The TGEV S protein is artificially divided into the S1 domain (residues 1-790) and S2 domain (residues 790-1, 383) [8, 9]. The S1 domain contains several neutralization epitopes, and four major antigenic sites (in the order C, B, D, A) are located in the S1 protein [10, 11].",

Consequently, antibodies are produced in the colostrum or milk and newborn piglets are passively protected from TGEV when they suckle immune dams (via lactogenic immunity) [13, 14]. Previous studies have demonstrated that neonatal piglets that receive high titers of TGEV-specific antibodies in colostrum and milk are protected from TGEV-induced diarrhea [15, 16]. Therefore, oral antibody administration may represent an alternative strategy for the prevention and treatment of TGEV infection.",

Single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies constitute one of the most commonly used types of genetically engineered antibodies for treatment of disease [22, 23]. The scFv antibody is a small engineered antibody (26-28 kDa) that includes a variable heavy (VH) chain and variable light (VL) chain linked by a flexible peptide linker. Compared with intact IgG molecules, scFv antibodies retain their antigen-binding capability despite removal of the constant regions and are genetically modified to increase affinity and specificity [24]. Moreover, scFv antibodies are easily expressed in a functional form in Escherichia coli [25]. scFv antibodies can neutralize various viruses, inhibit viral infection and protect hosts from infectious disease [26\u201328]. These studies indicate that scFv antibodies could act as a protective therapeutic treatment for virus infection.",

            "text": "TGEV infection is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration, with high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets (especially in piglets younger than two weeks of age). This can cause significant economic losses on affected farms [3]. In neonatal piglets, the main mechanism of protection is mediated by lactogenic immunity. Sows are vaccinated with inactivated or attenuated vaccine in order to induce the production of secretary IgA in colostrum and milk. The neonatal piglets are passively protected from TGEV when they ingest colostrum and/or milk with high titers of anti-TGEV secretory IgA antibodies [15]. Sows inoculated with inactivated vaccine do not generate the required local immune response in the small intestine and the replication of the attenuated viruses is limited, resulting in an inadequate immune response. Piglets cannot overcome infection unless adequate maternal antibodies are acquired. Passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies or antibody derivatives represents an attractive approach against TGEV infection. Egg yolk antibodies (IgY) against TGEV that are administrated orally to suckling piglets show a prophylactic effect on the piglets. Lee et al. demonstrated that oral administration of antibodies can protect piglets from diarrhea, which indicates that antibody administration is an alternative way of controlling TGEV infection [34]. Besides traditional polyclonal serum and monoclonal antibodies, oral administration of recombinant antibodies can also protect the host from diarrhea. Garaicoechea et al. demonstrated that mice that were inoculated orally with single-chain antibody fragments (VHH) against the inner capsid protein VP6 of rotavirus (RV) protected mice from rotavirus diarrhea [35]. This study offers promising alternative strategies to prevent RV-induced diarrhea and suggests that our selected scFv antibodies may be used as a novel therapeutic reagent to control porcine transmissible gastroenteritis in suckling piglets.",

A few years later, McCafferty et al. first reported that scFv antibodies can be displayed on the surface of the phage through phage display technology and that scFv antibodies can be obtained after biopanning [37]. This technique for the production of scFv antibodies has several advantages: rapid culture of phage clones, easy handling and detection of secreted antibodies, genetic stability, and lower production costs compared with monoclonal antibodies [38, 39]. Lika et al. first attempted to construct a porcine phage library by analyzing sequence data in the IMGT database [40]. These authors reported that information on the kappa and lambda chain repertoire is scant and that some of the kappa/lambda chains might not be recovered from the sites of the transcripts of porcine spleen [40]. The porcine scFv antibody library is incomplete, and further research is required. In this study, we constructed a porcine scFv antibody library against TGEV. The library size was large enough to select specific scFv antibodies despite being smaller than the recommended size (6 \u00d7 108 pfu/mL). To our knowledge, this is the first study using a porcine antibody phage library to select scFv antibodies against TGEV.",

            "text": "The scFv is a small, genetically engineered recombinant antibody in which the VH and VL chain of the antibody are connected by a flexible peptide linker. The scFv has considerable potential for use in receptor blockades, pathogen neutralization and therapeutic antigen targeting in vivo [41, 42]. In this study, phages expressing scFv antibodies were selected after four rounds of biopanning. TZZ 14, TZZ 19 and TZZ 43 were chosen because of their high binding affinity to TGEV antigen. The DNA sequences of the scFv antibodies were analyzed and their amino acid sequences were deduced. Our results showed that sequences of these scFv antibodies share similarities in the FRs and that their CDRs are highly variable, especially the CDR3 of VH and VL. Since CDRs contribute to the specificity for binding to a specific epitope, a difference in the diversity of CDR3 in the VL and VH domains reflects differences in antigen binding. We did not determine the affinity of this interaction, but we infer from the phage ELISA and sequence analysis that these two antibodies were variable. Previous studies indicate that scFv antibodies are able to neutralize various viral infections, including influenza A virus (H5N1 subtype), human immunodeficiency virus 1, respiratory syncytial virus, rabies virus, and infectious bronchitis virus [43\u201347]. Notably, most scFv antibodies can target viral surface glycoproteins, which in turn play a role in blocking virus adherence to receptors of host cells. These scFv antibodies with high affinity to TGEV antigen were further analyzed using a neutralization assay. Our results indicate that three scFv antibodies have a neutralization effect on TGEV infection.",

It is responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies, and it also affects viral binding to host cells before invasion, and thus pathogenicity [6, 48]. The neutralization assay indicated that three scFv antibodies exert neutralization activity. IFA results showed that ST cells transfected with p3XFLAG-TGEV-S was stained by TZZ 14 and TZZ 19. The exact epitope recognized by the scFv antibodies is still unknown, and current work is ongoing to map the epitopes recognized by each scFv. IFA and western blot results showed that scFv TZZ 43 do not bind to S protein-transfected cells. Some studies have shown that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of TGEV is also an inducer of neutralizing antibodies, and swine vaccinated with the N protein produce a mucosal immune responses against TGEV [49, 50]. Thus, TZZ 43 might neutralize virus infection through interacting with another TGEV viral protein (e.g. the N protein).",
