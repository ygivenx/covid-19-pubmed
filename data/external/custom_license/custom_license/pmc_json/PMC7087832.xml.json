In contrast, infections caused by HRVs appear throughout the entire year, sometimes with peaks in early autumn and spring [12\u201315]. The overall high incidence and observed lower degree of seasonality for HRV could reflect that there are several parallel or successive epidemics with different HRV types, each appearing in a time-limited fashion, similar to what is observed for other viruses causing ARTIs. A multitude of HRV types during each season has been observed earlier, both a long time ago by surveillance studies using viral culture [16] and more recently by molecular epidemiology investigations [17\u201320].",

The tree reveals that some of the HRV types appeared during two or three seasons, suggesting that these types might circulate in the population over long time periods. To further explore this, we constructed phylogenetic trees for each of these types, including sequences from our patients in comparison with \u224810 related sequences from GenBank retrieved by BLAST search. As shown in Fig. 3, some of these trees, indeed, show examples of strains or lineages of HRV that circulated in our population for 5\u201312 months, as indicated by a greater genetic similarity between them than with the most closely related sequences in GenBank. This analysis indicated that an HRV-A10 strain remained for 4 months, A33 for 12 months, A34 for 5 months, A49 for 4 months, A56 for 2 months, A60 for 7 months, C9 for 9 months, C14 for 10 months and C43 for 3 months. In other cases (Fig. 3b, e, j), strains belonging to the same type were more similar to database sequences than to each other. These trees also demonstrate that, for most of the HRV strains from our patients, there were several closely related sequences found in GenBank. The majority of the related sequences had been collected during the same year as our sequence, or the previous or following years.\n\n",

For each of these cases, there was at least one published sequence with 91\u201398 % similarity (in VP4/VP2), but the HRV types of these published sequences has not been defined because the strains have not been analysed in VP1, which is required for type assignment [23].",

To some extent, the seasonal pattern of HRV infections prevailing throughout the year might be explained by the great genetic diversity between and within HRV types. Thus, each HRV type might cause a restricted outbreak similar to most other viral ARTI agents. If this was true, HRV types would circulate in the local population during a limited time span, and over a four-year period, one would, by sequencing studies, be able to observe a large number of successive epidemics caused by different HRV types. It might be anticipated that a very large number of HRV strains would have to be sequenced in order to clarify this issue properly. Still, despite the limited sample size, this possibility was, to some extent, supported by the present study. Firstly, many HRV types were observed during each season and different types appeared over time. Secondly, the application of a BLAST search strategy on each HRV type that re-appeared during several seasons made it possible to show that such cases were sometimes caused by different strains of the same HRV type, with each strain closely related to strains observed in other parts of the world at approximately the same time. For example, two cases of HRV-A12 presenting in March 2008 were unrelated to another HRV-A12 strain found in April 2010, and one HRV-A10 strain appearing in May 2009 was more similar to strains from Italy, USA, Japan and Switzerland than to another HRV-A10 strain found in one of our samples from the same month. These findings support that HRV strains may appear locally in a time-limited fashion, similarly to outbreak patterns typical for influenza A and RSV [11].",

For example, one HRV-C9 appearing in November 2009 was identical to other C9 strains from March 2009, and an HRV-A33 sequence from September 2008 was identical to another one found one year earlier. These cases demonstrate that HRV epidemics may be more long lasting than influenza A and RSV outbreaks, which typically wane after 4\u20138 weeks, when the number of susceptible individuals have declined below a critical level. The explanation to the more extended duration of HRV epidemics is probably multi-factorial. Firstly, the clinical presentation of HRV infections is, overall, milder compared with influenza A, and HRV have been identified in significant proportions of individuals without ongoing respiratory symptoms [15, 24, 25]. Thus, HRV-infected subjects are more likely to expose other people to the infection. Secondly, HRV are shed during longer time periods, typically 2\u20133 weeks, as compared with less than 1 week for influenza A [26], probably resulting in a higher likelihood of spreading of the infection. Immunocompetent individuals may even shed the same strain of HRV for more than 4 weeks [27\u201329], and in immunocompromised individuals, shedding for as long as 27 months has been observed [30]. Thirdly, the robust unenveloped virion structure of HRV may increase the likelihood of indirect transmission via surfaces [30].",

This has previously been shown to agree well with the more reliable typing by phylogeny of VP1 sequences, and for HRV-A and HRV-B, a good correlation has been documented for VP1 sequence phylogeny and serological classification [18, 33, 34]. For HRV-C, in the absence of serological typing techniques, the classification of HRV is based solely on sequence comparison, and a nucleotide divergence of more than 13 % in VP1 has been proposed to be used to define new HRV-C types [23]. The VP4/VP2 region can also be used to classify HRV-C, but it is not considered to be sufficient for the identification of new types [23]. Thus, additional sequencing of VP1 is required in order to clarify if any of the five HRV-C sequences (and one HRV-B sequence) that were more than 15 % different in the VP4/VP2 region might represent a new HRV type.",
