Nevertheless, several whole-genome patents have been issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and further applications are pending. Although gene patenting has been challenged on ethical grounds and in regard to data access and criteria for patentability1,2,3, whole-genome patenting has so far gone almost unnoticed. Even the recent controversy surrounding patent applications for the genome sequence of the SARS-associated CORONAVIRUS4,5 (see also Online links box) is primarily concerned with whether patenting is an appropriate and effective way to control access to data and stimulate research. The SARS discussion does not address the implications of patenting a whole genome instead of the more common patenting of DNA fragments.",

At first glance, patent offices certainly do seem to be treating genome patents as if they were nothing other than standard DNA patents. However, further analysis reveals that patent specifications describing whole-genome inventions use arguments that imply that genomes are qualitatively different from individual genes. Whole-genome patents also use different arguments from microorganism patents, which might be thought of as a similar category of 'whole' biological patent. These distinctions are further complicated by the way in which the European Patent Office (EPO) has dealt with genome patent applications \u2014 a treatment that leads our exploration of genome patenting to the key issue of how arguments for the utility of DNA fragments apply in genome patents.",

This shift is of potential interest to several groups of interested parties and observers. For patent professionals, genome patenting gives an indication of how developments in genomics and bioinformatics might be changing the nature of patenting. For scientists, genome patents blur the supposed line between research and its applications, with implications for how research is financed and data shared. For social scientists, the interactions between genomics and the patent system are of great interest for understanding how society might benefit from the genomics revolution and how commercial interests might shape the future development of this science. Finally, for philosophers of biology, genome patenting raises issues about the consequences of conceptualizing genomes as sequence information or biochemical material, and indeed, what the study of genomes means for our understanding of biological entities.",

If, for example, a group of DNA fragments or sequences can be linked together by an overarching concept, they can then be covered by one patent.

Genome patents in the second category direct their claims to specified open reading frames (ORFs) or polynucleotides, but do so in the context of a broader specification of the invention that argues for the whole sequenced genome as an integral part of the invention. The patents for Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium were first filed as claim-specific genome patent applications, but during examination, their potentially far-reaching claims were restricted to specific ORFs. This restriction was probably the result of objections by USPTO examiners. The specifications of these patents, which do not normally change after filing, still persistently refer to the whole-genome sequence (and any sequence that is 99.9% similar) as comprising or providing the basis of the invention. Likewise, in the Methanococcus jannaschii patent, the summary of the invention begins with the whole-genome sequence, after which the invention is further directed to the ORFs in the claims. The claims of the two virus genome patents in this category similarly focus on particular sequence fragments but base their inventions on the whole genome.

Not surprisingly, the utility arguments made for microorganism patents15,16,17,18,19,20,21 are generally similar to those for genome patents (Tables 1,2). Microorganism patents for Archaea, for example, argue for uilities that are related to enzyme production in harsh environmental conditions, and bacteria patents claim applications that range from human health to BIOREMEDIATION. However, novelty is established in subtly different ways. Organism patents are based on previously unknown organisms that might have been isolated in unusual circumstances, whereas genome patents are usually based on the genomes of well-known but previously unsequenced organisms.",

The only organism patents that follow this strategy are the few that refer to the DNA of the specified organism, either to extend the coverage to further biological material18,19 or to encompass all organisms in the same genus with a certain percentage of sequence similarity15. In these cases, it seems that the DNA and its potential uses are called on to reinforce the organism patent and expand the protection it provides. Genome patents take this strategy one step further by claiming the complete sequence. The obvious question is whether a genome patent achieves more protection for the inventor than does a patent on a collection of DNA fragments.",

One examiner, for example, objects that a submitted genome sequence (Chlamydia pneumoniae) is merely a definition of a particular strain from the many isolates available, thereby questioning the patentability of genomic variation. In another case (Influenza A), the report notes that the identified genes are well known from other related strains and that their presence should therefore be expected.

Our initial hypothesis that the idea of a genome is sufficient to unite several genes and their functions into one invention is not, therefore, supported by these examples.

Some use sequence differences between strains as the basis of their genome-patent claim (for example, MCDV-Tn), whereas others discount such variations between strains by arguing that the patent covers other sequences within a certain range of similarity (for example, M. genitalium, H. influenzae and HEV).
