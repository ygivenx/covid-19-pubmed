The G or hemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase glycoproteins are thought to mediate virus attachment to the cell receptor3,4. The receptor for PIV-3 is sialic acid4, and RSV G may bind to heparan sulfate5,6. The F glycoprotein mediates at least two essential steps in the virus life cycle that require membrane fusion: it promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes with subsequent transfer of viral genome material into the cell, and promotes fusion of the infected cell membrane with those of adjacent cell membranes, leading to syncytia formation. The F glycoproteins of RSV and PIV-3 are synthesized as inactive precursors, which are co-translationally modified by the addition of N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. The F precursor is cleaved by cellular trypsin-like endoproteases into two disulfide-linked subunits, F1 and F2, before reaching the cell surface, and is assembled as a higher-order homooligomer7,8. RSV can infect cells in vitro despite lacking the G glycoprotein9, indicating that F may have additional functions of attachment to a host co-receptor. ",

We report here a RhoA peptide derived from the domain that binds the RSV F protein has potent antiviral activity against RSV and PIV-3 infection in cell culture and in RSV-infected mice. These data provide additional evidence for conserved structural and functional features between the fusion proteins of RSV and PIV-3 and for the possibility of common mechanisms involving virus-induced membrane fusion.

The RhoA67-85 peptide did not block RSV-induced syncytium formation. Varying the concentration of RhoA77-95 showed that the concentration required to inhibit number of plaques by 50% (IC50) was 0.54 \u03bcg/ml, or 0.25 \u03bcM. Immunoperoxidase staining did not show any RSV antigen-positive cells treated with RhoA77-95, indicating that RSV replication was inhibited at a step before viral protein synthesis.

We added 5 \u03bcg/ml RhoA77-95 to cells 0, 4 and 24 hours after RSV adsorption, and evaluated HEp-2 monolayers by fluorescent microscopy 48 hours after infection (Fig. 2). There was inhibition of cell-to-cell spread and syncytia formation in rgRSV-infected cells treated with the RhoA77-95 peptide compared with that of untreated, infected cells. The number of infected cells increased between 4 and 24 hours after infection, indicating the completion of one round of viral replication, production of new virions and infection of new cells before 24 hours. Therefore, the addition of RhoA77-95 seems to prevent subsequent spread of cell-free virus to other cells as well as preventing syncytium formation. These data also support the possibility of a block at an early step in the viral life cycle.",

One cell population was infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3 and transfected with three separate plasmids containing RSV F, G and SH genes. The other cell population was infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing \u03b2-galactosidase. The two cell populations were mixed and either treated with 5 \u03bcg/ml peptides or left untreated.

Cellular proteins contributing to paramyxovirus-induced syncytia formation have not been identified before. However, the lipid composition and other properties of the target cell membrane can influence the ability of a virus to produce syncytia20,21. A host protein, RhoA, has been shown to bind to viral fusion glycoprotein and facilitates syncytium formation14. We have shown here the inhibition of RSV- and PIV-3-induced syncytium formation by a RhoA-derived peptide (RhoA77-95) from the RSV F binding domain. This inhibition indicates that two viruses from the Paramyxoviridae family may use the same host cell protein and same binding site on this protein in the process of inducing cell-to-cell fusion, strengthening the concept of conserved functional and structural features of paramyxovirus fusion proteins. The role of RhoA in virus-induced fusion is not yet defined and might include a direct effect, or an indirect effect through signaling events on cellular cytoskeletal organization, cell shape or cell motility. The F protein interaction with RhoA might also be involved in other aspects of virus replication including assembly, filament formation or budding.",

The inhibitory effect of RhoA77-95\nin vivo on virus replication and potential for diminishing illness in the mouse model of RSV (Fig. 5) indicate that early treatment with a RhoA-derived peptide has therapeutic potential in RSV or PIV-3 infections, particularly in giant cell pneumonia, seen in patients with bone marrow transplantation, lung transplantation or severe combined immunodeficiency. Although the peptide treatment immediately before or 2 hours after RSV infection prevented illness in mice, treatment on day 4 after RSV infection had no effect on the illness (data not shown).

RhoA77-95 also blocked cell-to-cell-fusion in a virus fusion glycoprotein (F)-induced cell-to-cell fusion assay. Given immediately before infection or 2 hours after RSV infection, the RhoA77-95 peptide reduced RSV titer and prevented illness in mice. Exploiting the interaction between RhoA and F protein may also be useful for designing peptidomimetic or low-molecular-weight antiviral drugs.",

One population of HEp-2 cells was infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3, which encodes T7 polymerase, at a multiplicity of infection of 10 PFU per cell, and was transfected with plasmids encoding RSV glycoproteins F, G and SH under control of the T7 promoter (gifts from P. Collins, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). At 5 h after transfection, the cells expressing viral envelope proteins were trypsinized, suspended in MEM containing 2.5% FBS to a density of 2\u00d7107 cells per ml, and incubated overnight at 32\u00b0C. The cells were then washed and suspended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) at a concentration of 1\u00d7106 cells per ml. A second population of HEp-2 cells was infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing \u03b2-galactosidase under control of the T7 promoter (provided by E.A. Berger, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland). At 5 h after infection, cells were trypsinized and finally suspended at a concentration of 1\u00d7106 cells per ml. The cell population expressing the viral glycoproteins was treated with 5 \u03bcg/ml RhoA77-95 or RhoA87-105 peptide or left untreated, and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The two cell populations were mixed in triplicate by adding 100 \u03bcl of each cell population to 96-well tissue culture plates, which were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Cell fusion was measured by the quantitative colorimetric lysate assay for \u03b2-galactosidase or an in situ assay using X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl \u03b2-D-galactopyranoside; Life Technologies) staining of cells. In the colorimetric lysate assay, 5 \u03bcl 20% (volume/volume) Nonidet-P40 was added to each well, and the contents were mixed by pipetting. \u03b2-galactosidase activity was quantified at ambient temperature in 96-well flat-bottomed plates by mixing 50 \u03bcl of each lysate with 50 \u03bcl 2X substrate solution (16 mM CPRG (chlorophenol-red-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside; Boehringer), 0.12 M Na2HPO4.7H2O, 0.08 M NaH2PO4.H2O, 0.02 M KCl, 0.002 M MgSO4.7H2O and 0.01 M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). The rate of substrate hydrolysis at ambient temperature was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm with a spectrophotometer. The quantity of \u03b2-galactosidase was calculated by comparing the hydrolysis rates for each sample with that obtained for a standard commercial preparation of Escherichia coli \u03b2-galactosidase (600 U/mg; Boehringer). \u03b2-galactosidase levels were expressed as nanograms per well. For the in situ assay, 20 \u03bcl 10X fixative solution (20% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS) was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Without disturbing the settled cells, 0.15 ml medium was gently removed and replaced with 0.15 ml of 37 \u00b0C-equilibrated staining solution (5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mM magnesium chloride and 1 mg/ml X-Gal, freshly diluted from a 40 mg/ml stock solution in dimethyl formamide). The plates were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C to allow complete staining. Blue-stained syncytia were viewed with an inverted phase-contrast microscope.",
