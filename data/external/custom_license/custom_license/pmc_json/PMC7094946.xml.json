Although the World Health Organization (WHO) provided extremely fast information and support to afflicted countries, the European network of state epidemiologists and national agencies failed to respond quickly enough. Important information about possible cases of SARS or European travel restrictions were often communicated with delays of 48 hours or more. European healthcare officials hope to avoid repeats of such inadequate responses, and are determined that faster coordination and better surveillance will be made possible by a European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), similar to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. A decision about the new ECDC director is expected shortly, but it is already clear that this director will face an uphill struggle to create a European equivalent to the CDC.",

We also face threats from large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases, especially an influenza pandemic, and from the deliberate release of infectious agents by criminals or terrorist groups. Few of these problems are being addressed in a constructive way \u2014 industry is failing to develop new antibiotics and vaccine production is insufficient to meet the needs of a pandemic.",

The current difficulties of the European Union in collating and disseminating epidemiological information \u2014 as seen with SARS \u2014 will only get worse with the addition of ten new member states. Therefore the creation of an independent agency for surveillance and control of communicable diseases has been welcomed, and from 2005 the ECDC will operate from a base in Stockholm, Sweden.",

In addition to the CDC \u2014 which tracks both the US and global situations \u2014 there is the internet-based ProMed, now ten years old. This e-mail system (open to anyone who is interested) is run by the International Society for Infectious Diseases and is a major source of rapid and reliable information. One advantage of the Atlanta CDC is its ability to combine surveillance with active field forces. At present, Europeans have to call the CDC or the WHO for help when there are outbreaks in Europe. Although SARS was stopped in its tracks by such global coordination, Europe may not be so lucky next time.",

This is currently carried out on a national level in Europe. But EU countries vary considerably in terms of resources and which diseases are notifiable. The surveillance systems and the quality of the data generated also vary. For example, each year more cases of salmonellosis are reported for Swedish tourists visiting some European countries than for the entire native populations of those countries. Standardization of these systems is not likely to occur in the near future, except for the most severe infections, which will be regulated by the new International Health Regulations, to be ratified by the WHO in 2005.",

If even one of them becomes transmissible, we could be faced with an outbreak similar to the \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 of 1918. That epidemic resulted in approximately 40 million deaths and many who died were young and previously healthy individuals.

There are also plans to increase the number of BSL4 laboratories in Europe, from the handful in France, Germany, Britain and Sweden. It would make sense for the ECDC to form a network between these existing laboratories \u2014 thereby avoiding redundancy of effort.
