The genes that encode the MHCII include the Regulatory Factor X-Associated Ankyrin Containing Protein (RFXANK), Regulatory Factor X-Associated Protein (RFXAP), Regulatory Factor X, 5 (RFX5), and MHC-II transactivator (CIITA) proteins. Homozygous mutations in these genes lead to MHC-II Deficiency Syndrome and have been associated with early onset and severe respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, failure to thrive, and premature death. Herein we report two cases with significant clinical manifestations of immunodeficiency in patients with heterozygous mutations of the RFXANK proteins.",

Mature female mice (Balb/C) were divided into 5 groups including control, placebo, and 50, 100, and 200mg/kg of extract. The extract was injected intraperitoneal every other day for 20 days. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were taken and used to measure blood proteins and their electrophoretic pattern. Obtained data were analyzed using the SPSS program (p<0.05). According to the results, 100 and 200 mg/kg doses increased the amount of albumin, alpha-1 globulin, beta globulin, and A/G ratio. Therefore, it can be said that the extract has a positive effect on the blood system and plasma proteins and can increase the immune system without the presence of antigenic factors.",

She received rituximab weekly for 4 weeks resulting in an increase of platelet count to 90-100K/UL. She recently (March 2017) had a splenectomy to remove her large spleen, and since then, her platelets have rebounded to 400-500K/UL.

The date of birth, and date of lowest C3 level were considered as start points to calculate the observation periods for PCD and SCD subjects respectively. Infections requiring hospitalization or parenteral antibiotics were categorized as serious bacterial infections (SBIs). Descriptive analyses were performed to determine medians and ranges for continuous variables. Differences in rates of bacterial infection were assessed using the chi-square and kruskal-wallis tests when appropriate. Among subjects with CTDs, we treated every C3 measurement as a single observation (n=1,197) and studied the association between C3 concentration and the 30-day odds of having a SBI.

Mutations (heterozygote and homozygote) in TNFRSF13B, the gene that encodes the transmembrane receptor, or TACI, are associated with 8-10% of CVID patients (2). TACI mutation with reduced TACI expression on marginal zone and CD27+ memory B-cells can impair B-cell differentiation, proliferation, and isotype switch (2), contributing to the pathogenicity of CVID. Asymptomatic individuals with normal immunoglobulin levels who have TACI mutation are also reported in the current literature (2). We aim to describe the significance of the heterozygous TNFRSF13B variant in a patient with recurrent sinopulmonary and skin infections without apparent B-cell dysfunction.",

At 4 mo she developed an erythematous, papular rash on her face and extremities, nonresponsive to topical antifungal therapy. At 6 mo she was re-hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis and subsequently treated with multiple courses of antibiotics for presumed bacterial pneumonia followed by albuterol and oral steroids for possible reactive airways disease. During this course of treatment, her rash resolved. At 8 mo she presented with failure to thrive (wt <0.1% for age), multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure requiring intubation. Bronchial alveolar lavage confirmed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prompting an immune evaluation. Total immunoglobulins were normal for age, however antibody titers to tetanus, diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae were absent. Lymphocyte enumeration revealed elevated CD4 T cells and markedly diminished CD8 T cells, normal B and NK cells. T cell proliferation to mitogens (PHA, PWM) and antigens (Candida, tetanus) was absent, however T cells proliferated normally to stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. TREC number was normal by newborn screening, but was 2 std deviations below the mean and would have resulted in a positive screen upon repeat. Invitae 18 gene SCID panel revealed two variants of unknown significance, c.109C>G (p.Arg37Gly) leading to substitution of Arg with Gly and c.1529_1532dupGCAT (p.Ile511Metfs*65) resulting in a premature translational stop signal expected to disrupt the last 109 amino acids of ZAP70 protein.

Her paucity of CD8 T cells, abundance of CD4 T cells and absent proliferation to mitogens are also consistent with previously described cases of ZAP70.

Several educational initiatives have been successfully launched. We have submitted an invited review to Pediatric Blood and Cancer which provides a case-based review of primary immune regulatory disorders. We hosted the first Immunology for Hematology Oncology Practice (I-HOP) Cased-based Webinar Series. This series features case-based discussions of patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders presented by fellow trainees and mentored by senior clinicians. We will also be hosting an ASPHO Webinar focusing on the Laboratory Evaluation of Primary Immunodeficiencies and Immune Dysregulation Syndromes.

Because T cells are important for the normal functioning of B cells, most PID with a T-cell disorder lead to combined T- and B-cell disorders. Disturbances of the T-cell link of immunity are clinically manifested in early childhood. The most serious form of PID with violation of the T-cell link of immunity is a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the first symptoms of which are already observed in infants and are characterized by the development of life-threatening infections.",

In Europe, the classic presentation is widely recognized and nonendocrine autoimmune manifestations are rarely reported. A recent study of 35 American APECED patients demonstrated a more heterologous presentation, with many non-endocrine manifestations including urticarial eruption, hepatitis, gastritis, intestinal dysfunction, pneumonitis and Sjogrens-like syndrome, all uncommon in European reports. Within the American cohort, 80% of patients developed a mean of three non-triad manifestations before reaching the classic triad.

Clinical disease severity was significantly higher in patients with heavy chain and CD40L compared to patients with BTK (P = 0.003) and AICDA (P = 0.009) mutations. Paralysis following live polio vaccination was considerably higher in patients with heavy chain deficiency compared with BTK deficiency (P <0.001). We found a genotype-phenotype correlation among patients with BTK mutations regarding clinical manifestation of meningitis and chronic diarrhea. Surprisingly, we noticed that first presentations in the majority of ICF patients were respiratory complications (P = 0.008), while first presentations in LRBA patients were non-respiratory complications (P = 0.008).",

They were allocated to three groups each one has 15 subjects: first one received sternal pump and sternal recoil techniques for 12 sessions, three sessions per week. Second one received thoracic lymphatic pump and splenic pump techniques for 12 sessions, three sessions per week. Third one (control group) didn't receive OMT. Absolute count of CD4 was used to evaluate participants before and after application of the osteopathic techniques. Results: analysis showed significant increase in CD4 count after treatment in the second group also there was no significance in the first and third groups. P-value was 0.05. Conclusion and discussion: thoracic lymphatic and splenic pump manipulative techniques are effective methods of enhancing the immune system in healthy subjects (TLPT & SPT).",

The original method for assessing classical pathway activity was the haemolytic CH50 method, but this assay can be time consuming and has reagent stability issues due to the use of sheep red blood cells. There can also be high lab-to-lab variability due to differences in the protocols used. Here we report the assay characteristics of an automated, commercial, liposome-based assay to measure CH50 activity. We also compare the results obtained using the traditional haemolytic method with the automated, liposome-based method used on the SPAPLUS turbidimetric analyser.",

SCID is a pediatric emergency and is uniformly fatal without hematopoietic cell transplantation. Therefore, early diagnosis is important for prompt treatment. SCID can be detected using T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay. Newborn screening for SCID started in 2008 in Wisconsin and was added to the national recommended uniform panel for newborn screened disorders in 2010. There are currently 48 states performing mandatory screening for SCID in the United States. In August 2015 Puerto Rico (PR) added newborn screening for SCID to the mandatory newborn screening panel using dried blood spot specimen. A pilot program was done in 2011, in which one patient was diagnosed with SCID and successfully transplanted. The estimated incidence in PR is of 1:60,000 consistent with USA.",

Fungal and yeast infections included cryptococcal meningitis, oral thrush, dermatophytosis of the face, osteomyelitis of a finger, and onychomycosis. Laboratory tests in 2018 showed: mildly low T cell counts (791/uL) with a reversed ratio of CD4/CD8 T cells (0.22); almost absent B cells (2/uL); and low NK cell counts (19/uL). CD4+ T cells were mostly of the memory phenotype (87%). T cell development showed low counts of Th17 cells. T-cell stimulation tests demonstrated poor proliferation responses (<30%) to Concanavalin A, tetanus toxoid, and Candida albicans, with near-normal responses to pokeweed (>13%) and PHA (>84%).

More than 100 missense variants have been reported for RAG1, with disease-associated variants predominantly in zinc binding regions. The RAG1 missense variant in our patient also lies within the zinc binding region (amino acids 354-383). The variant is rare (mean allele frequency 0.0001521 in gnoMAD) and has been identified in at least one other individual with SCID (T-, B cell-, NK+). Although classified as a variant of unknown significance, occurrence in at least two individuals with deficiencies of T and B cells-- within a functionally important RAG1 domain -- supports an interpretation that the variant may be pathogenic. Most patients with CID with RAG variants are either homozygous for a poorly functional allele or have one nonunfucitonal and a second, poorly functional allele. We detected only a single potentially pathogenic allele. Our patient has decreased NK cells in addition to T and B cell defects. Further genetic studies including whole exome sequencing, are planned to identify further variants in RAG1 or other relevant genes.",

This descriptive study is limited by small sample size and the constraints of registry-based research. Although there appear to be differences between these cohorts, our findings suggest that tTCL may disproportionately affect different segments of the population. tTCL infants with normal mitogen proliferation may be able to tolerate rotavirus vaccination. Thus, routinely checking proliferation studies in all tTCL infants may help risk stratify these patients and minimize vaccine-related adverse events. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend more extensive genetic testing such as genetic panels, CMA, or WES. Systematically collecting information about patient characteristics and outcomes, as well as encouraging increased participation in registries such as FILL, may help address these shortcomings.",

The measurement of anti-dsDNA antibodies (Abs) is a gold standard serological test used in the diagnosis and monitoring of SLE, with higher serum levels associated with worse prognosis. However, not all anti-dsDNA Abs are pathogenic, and some patients have consistently high levels with low disease activity. One mechanism suggested for the pathogenicity of these antibodies is complement activation. Here we describe an assay to measure the C1q binding activities of anti-dsDNA Abs in SLE patients.",

Bound anti-dsDNA Ab/C1q complexes were then detected using a biotinylated anti-C1Q antibody (570 ng/mL) and streptavidin peroxidase (1 mg/mL). Normal reference ranges were developed in serum samples from healthy controls, and upper limits of these normal ranges were used as cut-offs. The dsDNA Abs and C1q binding capacity of bound Abs was then assessed in 49 SLE patients, and compared to other markers and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score. Results are displayed as absorbance at 450nm (AU).",

SLE patients with an increased anti dsDNA Ab concentration (>0.137 AU) were then separated into those with low (<0.313 AU) and high (>0.313 AU) C1q binding activities. Patients whose dsDNA Abs had high C1q binding activity were found to have significantly higher SLEDAI scores (mean 6.70 vs 3.19). Serum C1q concentration, serum dsDNA Abs (measured by another method) and serum C3 and C4 concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups.

A diagnosis of CVID had first been made when the patient presented with atypical transverse myelitis, low immunoglobulin levels, and lymphopenia. Over the years, his clinical picture was dominated by various forms of autoimmunity, namely inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, autoimmune haemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, rheumatoid-like polyarthritis, chronic liver transaminitis with biopsy-proven moderate fibrosis, and lymphocytic colitis with malabsorption. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy was started at diagnosis, and autoimmunity was sequentially treated with methotrexate, interferon beta 1-a, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and finally a combination of low-dose prednisone and sirolimus, with stabilization of his neurological condition, the most debilitating complication of his immune dysregulation syndrome.

The diagnosis of immune-mediated aplastic anemia soon became apparent, as demonstrated by a bone marrow biopsy performed in a peripheral center two days prior to admission. The underlying pneumonia and thereafter biopsy-induced Staphylococcus aureus iliac osteomyelitis and soft-tissue abscess were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as multiple surgical interventions. The patient was started on eltrombopag, high-dose corticosteroids and cyclosporin A, the latter promptly switched to tacrolimus due to liver enzymes disturbances, all of which resulted in no significant hematologic response despite over seven weeks of treatment (with concurrent treatment of complicating infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and intensive-care-unite myopathy). During that time, genetic confirmation of CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency was received, and the patient was thereafter started on abatacept on day 48 of current hospitalization. Administration of equine anti-thymocyte was initially foregone because of perceived infectious risk in the setting of poor iliac wound healing and superimposed adenovirus viremia; however, given the lack of response, it was given on days 52 through 54 of hospitalization. Haematologic response began on day 67 of hospitalization with a steady rise in all-lineage myelopoiesis up to a complete neutrophil response, platelet near-complete response as well as resolution of transfusion needs by day 101. While waiting for a well-matched bone marrow donor, isolated platelet decrease was observed and attributed to multiple factors, including low-grade thrombotic microangiopathy, inflammatory consumption and drug-related thrombocytopenia, but the patient remained well. To our knowledge, our patients presentation is one of the most severe manifestation of CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency to have responded to targeted therapy with abatacept, as a bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with resolution of both immune and infectious complications, showing that genetic diagnosis is helpful in optimizing the management of presumed CVID patients.",

Two patients died at 1.5 and 4 years while another of the patients is already 8 years old and is alive (without HSCT).

In the era of NBS an abnormal TREC assay should be followed by NGS approach as Cernunnos deficiency may present early in life as SCID,as other RS-SCID defects. Since genetic diagnosis takes time,functional radiosensitivity assays in peripheral blood may lead to the correct diagnosis and avoid exposure to alkylating agents during the conditioning regimen prior to genetic diagnosis. It would also be helpful in cancer patients to individualize and to guide the dosing of ionizing radiation (IR) and/or genotoxic agents to avoid accumulation of cells with genomic instability that could accelerate cancer development.",

The W623L missense variant in the STAT3 gene has been previously observed in one individual in association with Hyper-IgE syndrome (Al-Mousa et al., 2016). This variant is not observed in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016). The W623L is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure. In-silico analyses supported a deleterious effect, located within the SH2 domain, which is a critical functional domain (Chandesris et al., 2012; Koskela et al., 2012).

She was advised to follow-up on a yearly basis to the Primary Immunodeficiency Clinic to assess for recurrent infections and for changes in pulmonary health. Finally, targeted testing and clinical evaluation of both of the patients parents was recommended to determine if W623L was inherited or arose de novo.

Previous in vitro study has shown a significant increase of CTLA4 expression on LRBA deficient T cells after overnight culture with chloroquine, an older anti-malarial agent. This effect is likely due to increasing lysosomal pH. However, there is no evidence of such effect in human subjects after administration of weight appropriate doses anti-malarial agents.

He was referred to immunology clinic at 9 years of age for suspicion of Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Disorder. Primary Immunodeficiency Genetic Panel was sent which revealed a homozygous mutation in LRBA gene (c.6480_6481del). This novel variant resulted in a frameshift and created a premature stop codon 18 amino acids downstream from this location which may lead to absent or abnormal protein. Lung CT scan showed interstitial lung disease. Lung biopsy showed interstitial nodular and diffuse lymphoid proliferation. This diagnosis led to the testing of his sister (case 2) given her history of autoimmune illnesses and the family history of consanguinity. Case 2 is a now 13-year-old girl with type 1 DM, autoimmune thyroiditis, lymphadenopathy, psoriatic arthritis, and seizures. Her lung imaging showed pulmonary nodules without interstitial lung disease. Both cases received hydroxychloroquine while waiting for insurance approval of abatacept. CTLA4 expression on Tregs was measured prior to and four weeks after starting hydroxychloroquine treatment. At baseline, 8.6% of Case 1s CD4 cells were Treg (FOXP3+ve, CD25hi) and 51.4% of them expressed CTLA-4 (in contrast to 94.1% Tregs in the healthy control) with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 335. This ratio and MFI did not change after 4 weeks of hydroxychloroquine treatment (6 mg/kg/day). Soluble Interleukin-2 receptor levels were measured: Case 1 had a baseline level of 8510 pg/mL, which decreased to 2228 pg/mL after 4 weeks of hydroxychloroquine treatment. For Case 2: 8.4% of her CD4+ T cells were found to be FOXP3+CD25hi and 36.1% of these Tregs expressed CTLA-4. This ratio increased by 7% after one month of hydroxychloroquine. Increase in MFI was also noted from 298 to 386. Case 2 had a drop in soluble Interleukin-2 receptor level from 1265 pg/mL to 950pg/mL after treatment.",

Both patients possessed absent Tregs, absent memory B cells, and hypogammaglobulinemia. However, only the 8-month-old had poor T cell proliferation to PHA, ConA, and CD3. Both patients were found to be homozygous for the same novel variant of CARD11 (c.2509C>T; p.R837*). The mutation rendered CARD11 protein expression unstable and it was undetectable by immunoblot. To confirm CARD11 deficiency, we stimulated patient B cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA) and ionomycin across a time-course and immunoblotted for various signalling proteins in both the NF-B (IKK/, IB, p65) and MAPK (MEK1/2, MKK4, JNK1/2, ERK1/2) pathways as well as various cleavage substrates of the MALT1 paracaspase (RelB, CYLD, BCL10, HOIL1). NF-B and JNK activation were completely absent and MALT paracapase activity was lost, but surprisingly, MKK4 (which acts upstream of JNK) was intact.

It is a mechanism for depositing NIH data into USIDNET. A Registry of patient information may help us understand how many people have each disease.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe disorder resulting from hyperinflammation and hypercytokinemia that can lead to multi-organ system dysfunction (1) characterized by certain criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypofibrinogenemia or hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, increased soluble CD25/IL-2Ra, evidence of hemophagocytosis, or decreased/absent NK cell cytotoxicity (2). Secondary HLH occurs infrequently but often is preceded by smoldering infection in CGD (3,4,5). We present a case of HLH in a 38-day old male, the youngest reported case with CGD.",

Initial evaluation was unrevealing including chest x-ray, urinalysis, and blood and CSF cultures. He was admitted and treated empirically with cefepime. CT demonstrated multiple multifocal nodules of the lungs and spleen. After lung nodule biopsy was performed, antimicrobial therapy was broadened to IV meropenem, voriconazole, and micafungin. Despite this, he continued to have fever and developed new onset tachycardia, respiratory distress, and lactic acidosis. Further decompensation with vasoactive refractory shock was treated with vasopressors and stress dose hydrocortisone. Additional laboratory evaluation revealed rising liver enzymes (AST 1670u/L, ALT 307u/L), cytopenias (hemoglobin 7 g/dL, ANC 90/uL, platelets 96,000/uL), and coagulopathy (fibrinogen 93-135mg/dL). Splenomegaly was present on abdominal ultrasound. A diagnosis of evolving HLH was considered and dexamethasone was administered. Within 24 hours of clinical decompensation, the patient died of multiorgan failure. Subsequent blood cultures returned with gram-negative rods (and ultimately Burkholderia cepacia). Autopsy confirmed hemophagocytosis within the bone marrow. No mutations were found in genes associated with primary HLH.",

Physical examination and computed tomography (CT) imaging showed splenomegaly. There was no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Serum liver function test, auto-immune studies, hemolysis and hereditary diseases workup, viral and bacterial serologies were all normal or negative, except for mild hyperbilirubinemia and LDH elevation. Bone marrow examination performed four months prior to the splenectomy revealed mildly hypocellular marrow (50%) with trilineage hematopoiesis. Flow cytometric analysis and cytogenetics of the bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood were normal except for small population of large granular lymphocyte and mild low absolute B cell counts in peripheral blood. A laparoscopic splenectomy was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes due to patients worsening LUQ pain. There was no other treatment given prior to surgery. 24 hours post- splenectomy her leucocytes increased to 13.1 and platelets to 247. Her three-month post-splenectomy WBC count and platelet count was 8.9 and 391, respectively. Hemoglobin also improved to 14.9. Pathology showed red pulp expansion by small lymphocytes (Fig. 1) and subsequent IHC (Immunohistochemistry) was positive for CD3 (Fig. 2), CD2, CD7, TIA-1 and negative for CD8, CD5 and CD56. CD4 was difficult to interpret. EBER was negative. Flow cytometry (Fig. 3) showed increased gamma-delta T-cell population (20%) with positive CD3, CD2 and CD 7 and negative CD 5, CD4 and CD 8.

AIRE-interactors networks were obtained for all groups (link strength cut-off for gene-gene > |0.80| and for miRNA-gene < -0.80). AIRE expression in mTECs was quantified by immunohistochemistry.

Bone marrow biopsy reportedly showed normal trilineage maturation and her symptoms responded for a short time to splenectomy at age 14. Symptoms recurred at age 16 when she was also found to have pulmonary reticular opacities, prominent lymph nodes, and elevated B cells. Repeat bone marrow and lymph node biopsies at that time were unrevealing. Minor responses to treatment with IVIg, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil and GCSF were noted. At age 17, she developed varicella-related encephalitis shortly after vaccination. With a strong suspicion of an immune dysregulation syndrome, immune evaluation revealed normal immunoglobulins with good vaccine responses, elevated B cell numbers, normal T cell numbers, and normal mitogen proliferation. CTLA4 sequencing revealed a mutation in exon 2 [c.420C>A, p.Tyr140*] causing a premature translational stop signal, which was consistent with previously reported cases of CTLA4 haploinsufficiency. She was started on rapamycin initially for her cytopenias but was then transitioned successfully to abatacept with almost complete resolution of her anemia, neutropenia, and pulmonary opacities. After 6 months of stable control, she developed a precipitous drop in her platelets and was eventually diagnosed with Streptococcus viridans endocarditis of her native mitral valve. This responded to antimicrobial therapy, but eventually needed surgical intervention due to ongoing insufficiency. Around this time, she was also found to be newly hypogammaglobulinemic, necessitating ongoing IgG supplementation therapy. During successful replacement of her mitral valve with a biosynthetic prosthesis, it was noted that her aortic valve also had evidence of previous disease, implicating a prior endocarditis as part of her clinical syndrome as well.",

Here we present a pediatric HAE patient who had recurrent abdominal attacks in which constipation, secondary to the ADHD medication dexmethylphenidate (Focalin), appears to be a trigger. Of importance, this is the first pediatric patient with HAE to be described as having safely undergone a capsule endoscopy for direct visualization of the gastrointestinal tract. This was done to decrease the risks associated with the more invasive procedure of traditional endoscopy and colonoscopy.",

To further evaluate his abdominal pain, capsule endoscopy was performed and well tolerated. During an admission in January 2016 he received a full inpatient bowel cleanout, after which, his angioedema finally improved. Of note, he was diagnosed with ADHD and started on dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) just prior to this period of recurrent angioedema attacks, and he did not have attacks during the summer months when he was off the medication.",

This may be easily accomplished in the general population, however, in patients with HAE, these procedures carry greater risk and may be avoided, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment (2,4). A newer and less commonly used alternative for direct visualization of the gastrointestinal tract is capsule endoscopy. Some benefits are that it does not require sedation, is less invasive, and is less likely to be irritating to the mucosa (3). Additionally, since psychological stress may be a trigger for angioedema attacks, the decreased stress associated with a noninvasive procedure such as capsule endoscopy, makes it safer to use (1). Limitations of capsule endoscopy include dependence on battery life and its inability to biopsy or administer therapy if needed (3).",

Four months ago, he was found to have elevated liver enzymes on routine chemistry.

A cross-sectional study of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia and hepatic dysfunction found that histological findings of NRH were present in 84% of CVID patients and was associated with portal hypertension in 75% of cases (PMID: 17998147). Another study estimated the minimal prevalence of NRH in CVID patients as 12% (PMID: 18647320), stating that this was likely a gross underestimate as NRH may also be present in patients with normal liver function tests that are not routinely biopsied. Therefore, liver enzyme levels may not anticipate the severity of liver involvement. There is currently no treatment for CVID-related liver disease. Other causes of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, including hepatic veno-occlusive disease and Budd-Chiari Syndrome should be ruled out or treated in CVID patients presenting with hepatic disease. In the case of hepatic NRH in CVID patients, early detection could lead to earlier interventions (such as TIPS prior to hepatic encephalopathy), to mitigate complications.",

Starting at six months of age, he suffered recurrent episodes of acute otitis media (non-typeable Hib and Actinobacter Iwolffli), pneumonia, and RSV bronchiolitis. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated a de novo heterozygous c.1259G>A (p.R420Q) mutation in the EDA-receptor (EDAR) gene not present in the parental DNA. His physical exam findings and mutation were consistent with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), a rare genetic condition characterized by abnormal development of skin, teeth, hair, and sweat glands. HED is caused by defects in the ectodysplasin-A (EDA)-NFkB signaling pathway but is not typically associated with immune deficiency. Consistent with this, immunophenotyping showed normal sub-populations of T-, B-, and NK-cells. Immunoglobulin and complement levels were quantitatively appropriate. He had normal mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and normal antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination. NK-cell studies demonstrated robust cytotoxicity. However, nasal mucosa biopsy showed diffuse squamous metaplasia and the absence of ciliated epithelial cells. We hypothesize that recurrent infections in our patient arose from impaired mucociliary clearance due to a ciliary defect. This case raises the possible association between EDAR variants and ciliary dysfunction. It also underscores the importance of evaluating the immune status of HED patients with recurrent infections which could mimic NEMO-deficiency and have broad implications about clinical management.",

Whereas well-described clinical case reports in published literature have traditionally served as the source of phenotypic data used for variant interpretation, for PIDDs the causal variants are often private to the patients family and thus the sole source of phenotypic information for a novel genetic variant is frequently the history provided by the clinician on the test requisition form. Taking into account such heterogeneous information during variant interpretation requires establishing objective criteria for its inclusion as part of the variant interpretation process. To this end, we adapted our laboratorys pre-existing, evidence-based variant classification framework, called Sherloc, by developing point-based criteria for the inclusion of clinical information such as a patients phenotype, familial segregation patterns, and whether the variant is inherited or de novo in the patient. As part of this process, we defined clinical criteria for 154 PIDD genes. Here, we illustrate the application of this method and the importance of integrating clinical information into variant interpretation.",

Information from case report descriptions, segregation patterns, and de novo status were applied for 32%,15% and 4% of P/LP variants, respectively. In 37 (10%) cases, the clinical information provided by the clinician on the test requisition form was used as evidence in the classification of the patients variant as P/LP. Ten variants were initially classified as being of uncertain significance and reclassified following receipt of further clinical information or testing of additional relatives. In addition, 35 suspicious variants of uncertain significance were identified in which one or two additional patient case reports would allow for reclassification from uncertain significance to P/LP. These data illustrate the importance of providing good quality clinical information to the genetic testing laboratory both at the time of sample submission and following the receipt of genetic test results.",

Half of the patients (46/80, 57%) had no symptoms of immunodeficiency, while 15 (19%) and 19 (24%) patients manifested symptoms of humoral or combined immunodeficiency respectively, including six cases of late-onset immunodeficiency. In a significant proportion of patients (17/79, 22%), clinical features of immunodeficiency progressed over time. Of the 15 patients with non-skin cancer, eight had no preceding symptoms of immunodeficiency. Altogether 20 patients had deceased (SMR=7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)=4.3-11) including deaths due to pneumonia (n=4), malignancy (n=7, SMR=10, 95%CI=4.1-21) and lung disease (n=4, SMR=46, 95%CI=9.5-130).

MAGT1 gene codifies to MagT1 protein, a Mg2+- selective transporter, expressed in the human immune system, specifically in the spleen and the thymus. Functional studies have established the key role of MAGT1 in T cells and natural killer (NK) cell activation. Upon CD4+ T-cell receptor stimulation, MAGT1 mediates a transient Mg2+ influx that is necessary for phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCy1) activation, which drives Ca2+ rise and downstream signaling. This Mg2+ influx also regulates cytotoxic functions of NK and CD8 T cells through NKGD2, reason why these patients have impaired cytolytic responses against EBV. Eleven male XMEN patients have been described. We present the case of a 1-year old Hispanic infant with a pathogenic variant in MAGT1 gene that clinically manifested with early Pneumocystis jirovecii and cytomegalovirus (CMV) interstitial pneumonia, and EBV chronic infection with good response to intravenous immunoglobulins supplementation without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Laboratory study highlights low levels of NKG2D ligands. The objective of this case report is to broaden the spectrum of clinical presentation of XMEN disease, that manifests initially as a Combined Immune Deficiency (CID) and evolved with a favorable course of the disease with intravenous immunoglobulins supplementation therapy and chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",

Pancytopenia worsened, and he was started on cefepime and azithromycin without improvement in symptoms. Echocardiogram revealed vegetations in his pulmonary conduit and bilateral branch pulmonary arteries, but multiple blood cultures were negative. Upon further history, the patient reported contact with kittens. Bartonella henselae titers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from blood were sent and were both positive. He completed a 2-week course of gentamicin, 1-month course of ceftriaxone, and was transitioned to doxycycline and rifabutin. After initiating antimicrobial therapy, his weight and energy significantly improved, his blood Bartonella PCR became negative, and his splenomegaly resolved. Approximately one year later, the patient underwent pulmonary artery conduit replacement and Bartonella PCR testing of the tissue specimen was positive. He has had sustained weight increase, resolution of hypocomplementemia and splenomegaly, decrease in DNT cell frequency from >2% to 0.9%, and improvement though not resolution of cytopenias.

Pediatric cases of Bartonella henselae endocarditis have been associated with splenomegaly, cytopenias, and glomerulonephritis which mimic many features of monogenic immune dysregulatory disorders. The diagnosis of Bartonella endocarditis in our patient therefore raises the question of whether his immunosuppression predisposed him to infection or if his entire clinical presentation can be explained by Bartonella endocarditis.

Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, and Sephardic Jewish populations are most commonly affected. Homozygosity for MEFV mutations are associated with a more severe course.

At 11, 12, and 22 months of age, he developed three separate episodes of febrile seizures.

Four episodes of Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis confirmed by throat culture preceded tonsillectomy. No oral ulcers, joint pain, or abdominal pain were reported. No other infections such as pneumonia, sinusitis, UTI, non-viral gastroenteritis, fungal infections, or skin infections were reported.

Our patient is a 6-year-old African American female born to non-consanguineous parents. The patients past medical history is significant for chronic lung disease secondary to prematurity, recurrent acute otitis media, failure to thrive and congenital hypothyroidism. Family history is significant for an older sister that presented at age 3 with EBV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma whose treatment was complicated by chronic activated EBV infection and who ultimately underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Our patient presented with pancytopenia, fever, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. She was found to have EBV viremia with greater than 550,000 copies in whole blood by PCR. She was treated with two doses of rituximab followed by etoposide and dexamethasone as a bridge to HSCT. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated a homozygous mutation in CD27. CD27 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and influences the function of T cells, B cells and NK cells. In NK cells, CD27 is primarily expressed in CD56(bright) NK cells. CD27 deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with persistent symptomatic EBV viremia, including EBV-driven hemophagocytosis and lymphoma, hypogammaglobulonemia and specific antibody deficiency. Our patients immune evaluation prior to initiation of chemotherapy and immunosuppression was notable for very elevated IgG, IgA and IgM. Despite hypergammaglobulonemia patient had only 3 out of 11 protective titers against streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient had pan-lymphopenia with appropriate percentages of lymphocyte subsets. Assessment of her B cell subsets showed a slight increase in the percentage of transitional B cells/plasmablast and a nearly complete absence of CD27-expressing B cells. Her NK cell phenotyping demonstrated a complete loss of CD56(bright) NK cells with reduced NK cell cytotoxicity, comparable to what has been previously reported in patients with GATA2 deficiency. Previous reports of patients with CD27 deficiency denote normal NK cell numbers with normal to moderately reduced NK cell cytotoxicity, however, CD27 deficiency causing a specific loss of the CD56(bright) NK cell subset has not been previously reported. CD27 deficiency should be consider in patients with EBV driven disease and abnormal NK cell studies.",

Germline mutation in IKZF1 was first reported as a monogenic cause of human disease characterized by marrow failure and immune deficiency in a single neonate in 2012. Subsequently, mutations leading to haploinsufficiency were discovered to underlie a proportion of patients with CVID and low B cell numbers, and dominant-negative mutations have been observed to cause more severe combined immune deficiency phenotypes. At this time, there is very little known regarding allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes for patients with severe dominant-negative IKZF1 mutations.

Primary (1\u00b0) hypogammaglobluinemia can be caused by many primary immune deficiencies (PID) including combined variable immune deficiency (CVID), while secondary (2\u00b0) hypogammaglobluinemia can be caused by many acquired conditions such as lymphomas, leukemias, or chemotherapies and other immunosuppressive drugs. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) has been the mainstay of treatment in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia by reducing infection through replenishing the quantitative IgG. There are other applications of Ig therapy such as in autoimmune diseases, where the mechanism of action is thought to be Ig mediated immunomodulation. Innate immune cells have shown to be involved in such mechanism, but whether IRT modulates adaptive immune cells in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is not well known.",

Data regarding IgG level, number and type of infections after receiving IRT was collected. PBMCs were analyzed using flow cytometry for quantitation of T-cell subset. Cultured and anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated PBMC were also analyzed for extracellular and intracellular cytokine production, measured by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Combined Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr Virus and Influenza virus (CEF) peptides were used to study specific T-cell responses. Anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated PBMC were used for CellTrace T-cell proliferation assays. Data was grouped based on nature of hypogammaglobulinemia i.e. 1\u00b0 or 2\u00b0. Results were compared between before and after IRT using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test.",

There was no change in extracellular IL-10 and IL-17 cytokine production in both groups. In contrast, CD8+ T-cells in 1\u00b0 hypogammaglobulinemia patients showed significantly higher expression of intracellular IFN-y and TNF-a post-CEF viral peptide stimulation (p = 0.027).

Throughout her age, she had persistent neutropenia less than 0.5x109/L but in few occasions, her ANC elevated up to more than 1.0x109/L . She was treated as autoimmune neutropenia, respectively due to few positive results of autoimmunity workout such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA) but eventually later to be negative. Later at the age 9 years old, whole exome sequencing was performed and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, found a heterozygous variant in ELANE gene(c.640G>T; p.Gly214Ter), an autosomal dominant which was described to cause SCN. Both parents do not carry this mutation, hence, it is a de novo mutation. Currently, she had few on and off recurrent infections. Despite that, she is relatively well and on prophylaxis antibiotic.",

We developed a self-inactivating lentiviral vector (LV), in which a codon optimized human ADA cDNA is driven by the short form of the elongation factor-1alpha (EFS) promoter (EFS-ADA LV). The drug product (OTL-101), composed of autologous HSCs transduced ex vivo with the EFS-ADA LV, was evaluated in a prospective, historically-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial in ADA-SCID pediatric subjects. We report safety and efficacy at 24 months in 20 ADA-SCID subjects treated with lentiviral gene therapy (GT) compared to a historical cohort of 26 ADA-SCID patients treated with HSCT.",

Attempts to treat XCGD with gene therapy (GT) using transduced autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) transduced ex vivo with a gammaretroviral vector have met with limited efficacy due to transient engraftment of gene corrected HSCs, gene silencing, and vector insertion-mediated activation of oncogenes leading to myelodysplasia. We developed a novel self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector (G1XCGD LV) with a chimeric cathepsin G/cFes myeloid-specific promoter driving gp91phox expression from a codon optimized cDNA. Following transplant of G1XCGD LV ex vivo transduced autologous HSCs into busulfan-conditioned XCGD patients, there was long-term restoration of oxidase activity in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) at 12 months in 6 of 9 severely affected XCGD patients without evidence of genotoxicity. Here we present data about the multiple assays used to assess quality and quantity of restoration of PMN oxidase activity.",

G-CSF plus Plerixafor-mobilized CD34+ HSCs were transduced with ex vivo G1XCGDLV. Subjects received myeloablative conditioning with single-agent busulfan, targeted to net area-under-the-curve of 70,000 ng/mL*hr. Freshly prepared or cryopreserved quality-tested genetically-modified HSC, manufactured on-site, were administered intravenously.

Within 1 month post-GT, oxidase (+) PMN were present in peripheral blood based on NBT testing and DHR flow cytometry. Expression of the corrective transgene was confirmed by flow cytometry using antibody detection of gp91phox. Quantitative biochemical measurements of oxidase activity were also confirmed in some samples using the FerriC assay, demonstrating quantitative levels of superoxide production per corrected cell that were within the normal range. Functional testing of oxidase burst activity using DHR fluorescent assays was applied serially to follow levels of corrected PMN where oxidase activity per corrected cell also were in the normal range. All patients had >15% PMN DHR+ within one month, which remained stable for most patients over the follow-up period (Figure). Follow-up demonstrated sustained stable persistence of 12-46% oxidase burst positive neutrophils in 6 of 7 surviving subjects at 12 months, with restoration to clinically beneficial levels (defined as 10% of PMN being DHR+) in these patients as of December 2018.",

Gamunex-C has an extensive record of safety and tolerability when administered intravenously and subcutaneously for greater than 15 years in diverse patient populations. The IGSC 20% manufacturing process employs the same purification steps as Gamunex-C and was demonstrated to be robust and to provide an IgG product with the required potency, purity, and quality. The formulation excipient characteristics and compatibility with the drug product have been well established. Glycine has been an excipient of Intramuscular Immune Globulin (Human) for fifty years and Intravenous Immune Globulin (IGIV) for over twenty years. The IGSC 20% formulation has low buffering capacity, and a low pH was selected to achieve a product with low aggregates, low fragments and viscosity suitable for subcutaneous administration. To improve visual clarity, the IGSC 20% formulation contains a small amount of polysorbate 80 (PS80), which is widely used in biopharmaceutical products. Subcutaneous administration of the IGSC 20% formulation has been well tolerated in clinical studies.",

If not on a qualifying IgG regimen at enrollment, subjects (n=44) were required to enter the Run-In Phase, receiving IGIV-C 10% to achieve steady-state before entering the IV Phase to determine steady-state area-under-the-curve (AUC) of IV infusions. Subjects with a qualifying IGIV-C 10% regimen (300-800 mg/kg) (n=9) directly entered the IV Phase for steady-state IV PK assessments. Upon completion of the IV PK assessments subjects entered the SC Phase, receiving weekly doses of IGSC 20% for up to24 weeks, with steady-state AUC determined at the 13th dose. IGSC 20% was not associated with any reports of serious local infusion site reactions (ISRs). The majority of local ISRs were mild-to-moderate. IGSC 20% (at a dose conversion factor of 1.37) provided equivalent exposure to IGIV-C 10% as assessed by steady-state AUC0-7 days, with 33% higher mean IgG trough values, lower fluctuations in IgG concentrations and the flexibility of at home administration. IGSC 20% was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to IGIV-C 10%.",

The overall survival rate after RVT-802 is 71% with most deaths secondary to pre-existing infections, cardiac defects and/or respiratory conditions. With the advent of widespread newborn screening for primary immunodeficiency, the average number of patients referred for RVT-802 implantation is 18 per year.

            "text": "The study of early T cell development in patients with severe T cell immunodeficiencies is challenging because of the rarity of these diseases, the difficulty to obtain hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and limitations in the assays to assess in vitro differentiation of HSCs to mature T cells. We recently developed a serum-free system that allows faithful analysis of sequential steps of T cell differentiation. In this system, artificial thymic organoids (ATOs) are generated, based on the 3D aggregation and culture of a delta-like canonical Notch ligand 4 (DLL4)-expressing stromal cell line (Ms5-Dll4) with CD34+ cells isolated from bone marrow (BM) samples of normal donors (ND). In this project, we set out to evaluate the possibility of using the ATO system to study T cell differentiation in patients carrying T cell defects, in order to define the exact steps of T cell development affected by different genetic defects. Using the ATO system, we studied in vitro T cell differentiation from CD34+ cells obtained from patients carrying defects that are intrinsic to hematopoietic cells (RAG1, RAG2, AK2, IL2RG) or that affect thymus development (DiGeorge syndrome, DGS). The AK2-deficient patient showed a markedly decreased viability in CD34+ cells and a very early defect in T cell development, already at the pro-T cell stage. This defect was very similar to that observed in a patient carrying a null IL2RG mutation who was reported to show autologous reconstitution after unconditioned haploidentical HSC transplantation. In contrast, CD34+ cells from a patient carrying a missense IL2RG mutation and with a leaky SCID phenotype were capable of differentiating into mature T cells in vitro, although with 100-fold decreased efficiency as compared to normal donors (ND). Interestingly, in the patient carrying the null IL2RG mutation, we noticed very few cells that could reach full maturation, with an absolute number of CD3+TCRab+ cells around 1000-times less than in ND. At variance with pro-T cells (that failed to express the gc protein), these mature T cells did express normal levels of gc, suggesting that they may have derived from residual CD34+ cells from the BM donor. In addition, CD34+ cells from the patients carrying RAG1 and RAG2 hypomorphic mutations were able to differentiate to CD4+CD8+ double positive cells, but not to CD3+TCRab+ cells. Finally, the DGS patient showed a completely normal in vitro T cell differentiation, confirming that T cell deficiency reflected thymic abnormalities. In summary, our data show that the ATO system could be extremely useful in determining whether the lack of T cells in patients with unknown gene defects reflect hematopoietic or thymic intrinsic problems, and may therefore provide critical evidence in deciding whether HSC or thymus transplantation is warranted, even without knowing the actual gene defect.",

He developed granulomatous skin lesions at age 1, initially small papules on his cheeks and ears, which subsequently formed large disfiguring plaques on sun-exposed areascheeks, arms and hands (Fig 1). Following an extensive workup, his lesions were found to be secondary to a mutated vaccine-strain Rubella (RA27/3) based on 739bp genotyping, previously described in other immunocompromised individuals [Perelygina/Sullivan et al. JACI 2016]. His lesions have been refractory to multiple treatments including nitazoxanide. He is currently on daily oral and topical steroids, TMP/SMX and IVIG. Retrieval of his NBS for TREC determination revealed that he would have screened positive [Mallot/Puck et al. J Clin Immunol 2013].

T-cell functional mitogen responses were normal. She was diagnosed with CHH with homozygous RMRP c.70A>G mutation. Lymphocyte subset (T, B and NK cells) radiosensitivity was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylated (p) ATM, SMC1 and gamma-H2AX after low-dose (2Gy) irradiation. An increase in gamma-H2AX level was observed in a subset of non-irradiated T cells (17.66% v. 1.36% gamma-H2AX+) and NK cells (23.07% v. 1.04% gamma-H2AX+) in the patient, suggestive of a constitutive defect in DNA repair. The relative distribution of T, B and NK cells expressing pATM, pSMC1 and gamma-H2AX at 1 hour post-irradiation (IR) was not significantly different from the experimental healthy control (EHC) or pediatric reference range (pRR). However, the kinetics of dephosphorylation at 24 hours post-IR was altered with residual gamma-H2AX expression in a subset of the patients T cells (delta 3.84%, mode ratio mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)=2.58; EHC: delta 0.10%, mode ratio MFI=1.39; pRR: delta 2.16%, mode ratio MFI=2.42). A similar finding was observed in a subset of patient B-cells for gamma-H2AX (delta 11.35%, mode ratio MFI=1.48; EHC: delta 0.82%, mode ratio MFI=0.86; pRR: delta 1.95%, mode ratio MFI=1.19). The frequency of the patient's lymphocytes with residual gamma-H2AX persistence at 24h post-IR was prominent, with 8.29% T-cells demonstrating persistence of gamma-H2AX (compared to 0.82% in the EHC, and 2.60% in the pRR), and 18.02% B-cells gamma-H2AX+ (compared to 1.80% in the EHC, and 2.96% in the pRR).

The ability of RMRP to associate with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and function as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding distinct silencing RNA sequences, may underlie radiosensitivity in RMRP mutants. Systematic characterization of lymphocyte radiosensitivity and immunological phenotype could provide useful information on whether this could serve as a biomarker for the magnitude or complexity of immunodeficiency. Assessment of radiosensitivity has implications in conditioning regimen selection for patients requiring allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. We recommend lymphocyte radiosensitivity assessment in CHH infants identified by NBS SCID and CHH patients with significant immunodeficiency and/or malignancy.",

He also had multiple pneumonias and bronchiectasis, and oral candidiasis. He received all vaccines, including BCG with no complications. With low immunoglobulins and a poor response to pneumococcal polysaccharides and tetanus toxoid he was diagnosed as CVID and placed on IVIG at 7yo with excellent infectious control since then. At age 8, his skin lesions persisted and deepened to the bone on his left leg. Broad spectrum antibiotics for 3 months were unsuccessful. At 16yo to 18yo, skin grafts were performed on his arms, legs and both cheeks. Two ulcers persisted on his left leg until August 2018 that increased in size, deepened and became erythematous and extremely painful (Fig. 1). In September, two new ulcers appeared on his right cheek and right gluteus, respectively. One week later a third ulcer was found on his left calf. On September 28th, Infliximab 5mg/kg (300mg) was administered. On the second Infliximab dose, October 12th, the pain was completely gone and all ulcers were shrinking, and those ones in the cheek, gluteus and calf almost completely resolved. By the third dose, on November 23rd the ulcers in his right leg were almost closed (Fig. 2). Infliximab 300mg treatment continues every 8 weeks.

He was found to have severe neonatal thrombocytopenia based on complete blood count (CBC). He received a platelet transfusion on day of life (DOL) 1, was discharged home with stable platelets on DOL 5 but had worsening thrombocytopenia on DOL 8 requiring re-admission for further work up (platelet count 40,000). Platelet count reached a nadir of 26,000 on DOL 11. He was initially thought to have neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Parental testing showed no platelet abnormalities or platelet alloantibodies. He re-presented for acute lower GI bleeding on DOL 19. His platelet morphology at that time showed small platelets, though previously his platelet size was reportedly normal. Genetic testing for WAS revealed a variant of unknown significance (VUS) in the WAS gene (WAS NM_000377.2. Exon 2. C.151GT. P.VAL51Phe. Hemizygous. VUS. Chr X: g: 48542690G>T). This mutation, WAS c.151G > T (p. Val51Phe) is a missense variant in exon 2 which changes an amino acid valine at codon 51 to phenylalanine. This is a region essential for interaction with the WASP interacting protein (Rajmohan, 2009). This variant has not been reported in the literature as pathogenic and has not been reported as a known variant in the general population. In silico computational evidence predict the variant to be damaging (Polyphen2, Mutation Taster, SIFT, HSF). Further immune evaluation was performed. Flow cytometry revealed a low absolute CD3 count, low absolute CD4 count, low absolute CD8 count, CD4/CD8 ratio of 5:1, with normal NK cell count and low absolute CD19 count. His immunoglobulins were abnormal, with low IgM and elevated IgA with normal IgG and slightly elevated IgE. WAS protein expression testing revealed decreased expression of WAS protein on lymphocytes (0.24 ratio, normal range 0.71-1.31). At the time of his initial presentation to immunology at age 3 months, he had not developed atopic dermatitis nor any significant infections. However, at 4 months he was admitted for otitis externa with adjacent facial cellulitis, which responded to IV antibiotics. During that admission he was given IVIG and started on Bactrim prophylaxis. He has since developed significant seborrheic dermatitis skin lesions. Family history was not significant for immunodeficiency. No known WAS in family, no consanguinity. Maternal genetic testing was positive for the same missense mutation in the WAS gene. The patient is currently undergoing stem cell transplantation with a matched sibling donor.",

He was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and chronic arthritis when he was 6 and 9 years of age, respectively. Subsequently, he developed hepatitis and recurrent pneumonia with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). His arthritis partially responded to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents and tofacitinib, but did not respond to anti-interleukin-6 treatment. A combination of anti-TNF inhibitor, tofacitinib, and low dose prednisone was required to control his arthritis. Case#2 was an 18-year-old Caucasian male who initially developed thrombocytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <110 mg/dL), recurrent otitis media, pneumonia, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, LAD and failure to thrive at 2 years of age with more recent development of HSM. He required only immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Case#3 is a 9-year-old Caucasian male, the half-brother of case#2, who initially presented with recurrent pleural effusion and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, HSM, LAD, abdominal distension and ascites at 7 years of age. A transbronchial lung biopsy revealed chronic eosinophilic pneumonitis. Liver biopsy showed increased eosinophils in the sinusoids with diffuse enlargement of hepatocytes, but without hepatitis.

His past history was significant with an episode of pneumonia at 1 year and recurrent soft tissue swellings all over the body since 1\u00bd years of age. On examination he was wasted, had signs of micronutrient deficiency, rickets, pallor, cervical lymphadenopathy and two abscesses, 12x4 cm on right temporo-parietal region and 4x3 cm over left frontal region. He was also found to have hyperdynamic precordium with an ejection systolic murmur. Investigations revealed hemoglobin 85g/L; platelet count 7.34x109/L; total leukocyte count 13x109/L(N60/L23/M13/E1); elevated C-reactive protein( 244 mg/L) and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate(104 mm 1sthr). Chest x ray revealed cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio 67%) and 2D echocardiography showed vegetation of 6x3 mm over the anterior mitral leaflet suggestive of infective endocarditis. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Culture from pus over the temporo-parietal abscess showed growth of Aspergillus fumigatus. Human immunodeficiency virus serology was non-reactive. Immunoglobulin profile revealed elevated IgG 21.20g/L (5.40-16.10g/L) and IgA 5.66 g/L(0.5-2.4g/L); IgM was 1.63 g/L(0.50-1.8g/L). In view of strong suspicion of CGD, nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction test (NBT) was carried out- it revealed no reduction and Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay showed a low stimulation index (4.34). Flow cytometry for gp 47 phox and gp 67 phox was normal and DHR of mother did not reveal X linked carrier state. Contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) of head showed osteomyelitis of the calvarial bones. Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) brain showed heterogeneously enchancing soft tissue lesion in the scalp at right fronto-parietal region and left frontal region with underlying bony destruction suggestive of osteomyelitis. He was given intravenous antimicrobials (ceftriaxone, gentamycin, cloxacillin, voriconazole). After 6 weeks of therapy, he showed resolution of findings on MRI brain and a repeat 2D echocardiography showed significant decrease in size of mitral leaflet vegetation.",

Although no bacteria was detected in PCR and tissue culture of the bone biopsy and the patient was not responded to antibacterials , he had a dramatic response to empirical anti mycobacterial treatment and his severe bone pain and lesions were healed. Even though the bone manifestations were completely controlled, he continuously was under treatment for his gastrointestinal symptoms. Genetic analysis was confirmed segregation of homozygous mutation in 3splice site of exon 15 in IL-12R1. Expression of gene was completely abolished in PBMCs of patient and the surface expression of IL12RB1 was not detectable in T cell derived PBMCs of the patient compared to healthy control.

On examination he was pale, lethargic, and tachycardic. A chemistry profile revealed markedly elevated liver enzymes, increased bilirubin, and coagulopathy, consistent with the acute hepatic failure (ALT 6291, AST >4000, total bilirubin 3.49 (2.82 DB), GGT 52, and INR of 2.1). He was hospitalized, given Vitamin K, and kept on intravenous fluids, ursodiol, and anti-pyretics. His liver function improved significantly within 5 days of admission (ALT was down to 980, AST 45, total bilirubin 1.62). Work-up of possible etiologies including autoimmunity and infectious hepatitis was negative. Liver sonogram was normal, but liver biopsy was consistent with acute hepatitis with some necrosis. Urine organic acid and plasma amino acid screens were not consistent with any inherited metabolic disorders. His parents recalled two previous episodes of liver failure at ages 3 and 4 years. Both were preceded with a mild febrile illness and non-specific symptoms including fever, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and decreased PO intake. These subsequently were followed by jaundice and marked elevation of liver enzymes. Flu A and adenovirus were identified as causes of febrile illnesses of the two previous episodes. For this admission, adenovirus was found in the respiratory secretions and a mild EBV viremia was also detected. Genetic evaluation in Chile was reportedly normal. After a literature review we obtained sequencing of NBAS which revealed two variants: c.2827G>T,p.Glu943* and NBAS c.2951T>G, p.IIe984Ser. Both variants have been previously reported in patients with an infantile onset, recurrent liver failure syndrome. His other clinical features include developmental and speech delays, failure to thrive, and facial dysmorphism. He also has a history of recurrent ear infections and has had 3 sets of tympanostomy tubes. Further testing was limited due to the lack of insurance coverage.",

Once individuals have survived to adulthood they do not seem to develop liver failure with illness. Typically, liver crisis is triggered by a common childhood febrile illness. The mechanism of disease is thought to be thermal instability of hepatocytes which improves over time in most cases. However, although spontaneous recovery can occur following the crises, each episode can be fatal or result in permanent liver damage required liver transplantation. Increased awareness of this disease will lead to the early establishment of the diagnosis. Appropriate and timely management of fever at the onset of illness can significantly improve outcome in this potentially fatal disease.",

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening illness defined by acute hyper-inflammation and unopposed cytokine release. It is considered an acquired condition secondary to infection, rheumatoid disease or malignancy. The early therapeutic use of IL-1b inhibition has profoundly improved the prognosis MAS. It has recently been shown that increased free IL-18 levels in the blood are causatively linked to the development of MAS.

Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) identified a heterogenous likely pathogenic de novo variant in cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42) c.563G>A (p.C188Y). CDC42 encodes a small RHO family GTPase that regulates multiple signaling pathways controlling cell polarity, migration, endocytosis and cell cycle progression. Single allele mutations in the CDC42 gene were recently reported to cause Takenouchi-Kosaki syndrome manifesting with growth retardation, developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, and thrombocytopenia however systemic autoinflammation has not been described.

This increase in free IL-18 heightened her risk of developing MAS. Her IL1-b level was normal, but an increase in IL-1b is hardly ever detectable in the serum despite playing a critical role in this type of inflammation. Indeed, chronic IL-1b excess in the tissues promotes systemic inflammation and is associated with chronically elevated CRP and ESR. With this rationale we started the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. Within 48 hours from starting anakinra, the parents observed an increase in appetite, resolution of arthralgias and improved mobility. Over the course of the following weeks, fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia and rash disappeared, the spleen massively decreased in size and the patient started to meet developmental milestones.

SIOD is caused by homozygous mutations in the SMARCAL1 gene. SMARCAL1 encodes a DNA-annealing helicase that functions in gene expression modulation and maintaining genome integrity at stalled DNA replication forks. Recent in vitro studies implicate a role for SMARCAL1 in telomere maintenance; SMARCAL1 is enriched in cells that maintain telomeres via the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway and SMARCAL1-decifient cells demonstrate telomere instability with replication fork collapse and increased telomere-associated DNA damage.[1,2] Telomere analysis of 4 SIOD patients, including one patient who received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) 20 years prior, as well as 5 heterozygous family members revealed significantly shorter telomeres in SIOD patients compared to heterozygous family members and compared to age-matched, healthy controls.",

Due to tenuous clinical status, she received rituximab for treatment of EBV prior to definitive lymphoma diagnosis. She was treated with chemotherapy per protocol ANHL1131, group B (pre-phase with COP, courses 1 and 2 with COPADM, and courses 3 and 4 with CYM) and her course was complicated by seizures attributed to methotrexate toxicity. She ultimately underwent reduced intensity conditioning with hydroxyurea, alemtuzumab, fludarabine, mephalan, and thiotepa followed by a CD-34 selected, HLA-matched, unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Her early post-transplant course was complicated by adeno- , EBV, and CMV viremia, all successfully treated with antivirals and a donor lymphocyte infusion.

PLAID mutations have been identified in SH2 domain, but it has been known that both SH2 and SH3 domains facilitate PLCG association with other proteins. Studies with deletion of PLCG2 gene have shown functional abnormalities in B cells, natural killer cells and mast cells. To our knowledge, there has not been any previous report of a CVID patient with a variant mutation at the SH3 domain of the PLCG2 gene without being diagnosed as PLAID or APLAID. Our patient has immunodeficiency, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, steroid-dependent recurrent autoimmune thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatosplenomegaly, early-osteoporosis and restrictive lung disease.

It is caused by mutations in genes involved in the granule-dependent cytotoxic pathway, and is characterized by extreme inflammation and massive tissue infiltration by activated T cells and macrophages. To this day, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only available curative treatment with a transplant-related mortality of 30%. Thus, the development of new, more efficient anti-inflammatory treatments would be a significant advancement in the treatment of HLH. Here, we hypothesize that combination therapies targeting both JAK-dependent and independent cytokines will be more effective than either one alone to reduce the life-threatening symptoms induced by this pathology.",

Targeting the JAK-STAT signalling pathway with ruxolitinib, a specific inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, downstream of IFNg and IL-6, but not IL-18, is similarly beneficial. More importantly, combination therapies using ruxolitinib and blocking antibodies to either IFNg or IL-18 show synergistic effects, further mitigating the progression of the disease. These results suggest that JAK-dependent and independent cytokines drive the pathogenicity of HLH in perforin-deficient mice. It further supports that ruxolitinib, although effective in reducing the symptoms of HLH, should be used in combination with anti-IFNg and/or anti-IL-18 antibodies to prevent HLH progression. This is particular relevant since the former were recently approved for the treatment of HLH while the latter (IL-18 binding proteins) are in clinical trials for IL-18-dependent macrophage activation syndromes.",

At the age of 20, he presented with an ANCA-negative systemic vasculitis, manifesting as pulmonary haemorrhage, and acute necrotizing pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Pulsed methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide induced an initial remission, however, relapse a year later led to end-stage renal failure. He is now dialysis-dependent, and due to the underlying PID, and chronic CMV viraemia, is not a candidate for renal transplantation.",

However, over time there has been a significant reduction in B cells and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells demonstrated a skewing towards a central memory phenotype (CD45RO+/CCR7+), and CD4 T cell proliferative responses to PHA were comparable to a healthy control. Functional analysis of primary cells from the proband revealed a complete absence of BNS protein expression, dysregulated NF-B signaling, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

Overall, WES was diagnostic in 15% (30/198), confirming a preexisting diagnosis in 7% (14/198), and offering a new or more specific diagnosis in 8% (16/198). Variants of uncertain significance were identified in a further 28 patients (14%) in genes known to be associated with their clinical diagnosis, that warrant further functional validation. In the HAE group, diagnosis was confirmed in only 5 patients (45%), suggesting that WES may not be the appropriate technique for genetic diagnosis in this condition. A higher diagnostic rate was observed for autoinflammatory disorders (20%; 8/40) compared to PID (12%; 18/146).

At age 5yrs he received a nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplant from his 10/10 non-carrier sister as previously reported (NEJM 344:881, 2001). Conditioning was cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) on D-6 and D-7; daily fludarabine (25mg/m2) on D-5 through D-1; Antithymocyte globulin at 40mg/kg on D-5 through D-2. Post-transplant immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine on D-4 through D+100. He received 7.8x106 CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells which were T-cell depleted with 1x105 add back of CD3+ cells on Day 0. After 10 days of neutropenia (ANC <500) there were signs of engraftment. Per protocol, he received donor peripheral-blood lymphocytes containing 2.0x106 CD3+ cells/kg on D+ 30 after transplantation. Since donor T cells constituted less than 60 percent of his circulating CD3+ T cells and he had no graft versus-host disease, he received 1.0\u00ac107 CD3+ cells/kg on D+60. After the discontinuation of cyclosporine, he received a total of three donor-lymphocyte infusions (1.0\u00ac107 CD3+ cells/kg) at 90-day intervals achieving 100% T cell and myeloid engraftment at 26 months post-transplant with no acute nor chronic GvHD. At last follow-up 6 years post-transplant (2004) he had 100% and 98% lymphoid and myeloid peripheral chimerisms, respectively. The patient and family declined further periodic followup. Then, in October 2018 he presented with malaise, cough and fevers. He eventually was found to have a large consolidation and a BAL grew Burkholderia cepacia. His DHR showed 12% activity and peripheral blood myeloid and lymphoid chimerisms were 12% and 60%, respectively.",

The infant was noted to have a left sided abdominal wall defect and hernia, imaging identifying left renal agenesis, and was initially suspicious for VATER syndrome. Fortunately, the infant's SCID NBS revealed low T cell receptor excision circles (TRECS). Her initial white blood cell count was 14.1 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 2.679 K/UL. EBV PCR, CMV PCR, and HIV studies were negative. Chest imaging discovered absent thymus, abnormal vertebrae with only 10 ribs on the right and 12 ribs on the left, and abnormally formed thoracic vertebrae (T7). Echocardiogram detected an atrial septal defect measuring 0.32 cm, possible PFO versus secundum ASD. Endocrinology was consulted for management of labile calcium and phosphorus levels. FISH was negative for 22q11.2 deletion. Microarray revealed a variant of unknown significance arr[GRCh37]2p11.2(86285942_86506132)x3.

Low CD19+ B cells (median 0.5/mm^3, range 0-28) were reported in all available records. The absence of CD19+ B cells was observed up to 21 years post-thymectomy. A wide range of additional laboratory abnormalities were identified: low CD4+ T cells (n=5), low CD8+ T cells (n=2), low CD4/CD8 ratio (n=6), low NK cells (n=6), and absent peripheral eosinophils (n=8). The most common sites of infections were lower respiratory (70%), upper respiratory (55%), and gastrointestinal (35%).

Identifiable infectious agents included: bacteria (35%), virus (35%), fungus (25%), parasites (10%), and protozoa (5%), with opportunistic infections recorded in 25% of patients. Opportunistic infections were significantly associated with absolute CD4 lymphopenia (p=0.048, Fishers exact test). Enterovirus was identified as a previously unreported cause of meningoencephalitis in this population. Autoimmune manifestations were reported in 45% of patients, with a higher prevalence of inflammatory colitis (20%) than previously reported. Hashimoto thyroiditis, fibromyositis, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (n=1 each) were identified as previously unreported autoimmune/inflammatory conditions in this population.

HSP is typically a self-limiting disease of childhood following a viral illness. There is no universal treatment for patients with chronic or recurrent HSP. We report a chronic refractory case of HSP that was successfully treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), Etanercept. Etanercept functions as recombinant protein that consists of a TNF-alpha receptor ligand-binding region that links to the Fc portion of human IgG. It is currently approved for use in 5 diseases: juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis. TNFi are categorized into two broad categories, recombinant receptors (etanercept) and neutralizing antibodies (ex. infliximab and adalimumab). There have been prior case reports of HSP associated with TNFi agents during the treatment of other autoimmune conditions in the adult population. To our knowledge, there have been 3 prior etanercept related HSP reports, one report associated with adalimumab, and one with infliximab. However, there has been no prior report of etanercept use successfully treating chronic refractory HSP.",

His IgA level was 545 mg/dL prior to therapy. Despite treatment for one month of steroids, eight months of sulfasalazine exclusively and eight months of methotrexate and sulfasalazine, he continued to have persistent purpura on bilateral extremities without improvement. He was subsequently initiated on Etanercept 50mg weekly and methotrexate was discontinued. Approximately one month later, his rash significantly improved. His rash and joint pain recurs when he misses a dose of Etanercept. Punch biopsies were taken 3 months after initiation of etanercept. The biopsies of a lesion from his left arm showed early leukocytoclastic vasculitis and from his left leg showed weak granular deposition of IgA, IgM and C3 within vessel walls. There is controversy whether this is a true IgA vasculitis.

Most affected HH patients are homozygous for the mutation designated C282Y at the HFE gene located at the 6th chromosome. Unlike hereditary hemochromatosis, clinical manifestations of iron overload appear to be quite uncommon in patients who are heterozygous carriers. HH patients are at risk for a number of infections with bacteria whose virulence is increased in the presence of excess tissue iron. HH is also a risk factor for acute fulminant FRS . Here the mechanism is postulated to be due to quantitative or qualitative neutrophil defects as this condition is mostly seen in patients with DM, aplastic anemia, and can happen in patients undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy. No known increased susceptibility for infections through either mechanism is postulated for patients with the heterozygous carrier state. Here we present 3 HH carrier patients who present with recurrent rhinosinusitis with no allergen sensitizations and normal IgE levels. Since most fungal immunity is at the tissue level and is cytokine driven, it can be speculated that increased tissue levels of iron might interfere with mechanisms of innate immunity.",

She had a history of recurrent Staphylococcal skin abscesses and presented with inability to use her prostheses due to pain from inflammation around her amputation sites. She underwent imaging and was found to have bilateral extremity abscesses with an associated osteomyelitis of her L tibia (which was found to be MRSA after incision and drainage). While receiving intravenous antibiotics for her osteomyelitis, she developed intractable abdominal pain. Imaging showed a thick-walled, multi-septated, paranephric abscess as well as several smaller abscesses scattered throughout her abdomen. She underwent multiple drain placements and drainage of retroperitoneal fluid collections via interventional radiology (IR). Purulent fluid from the abdominal abscess drainage grew MRSA. The patient continued to have re-accumulation of abscesses despite multiple drainages. Repeat imaging noted increased paranephric abscesses which were not communicating with drains. Given lack of response to several IR-placed abdominal drains and to 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, she had an open surgical washout with minimal improvement. Hospital course was further complicated by development of a left lower lung lobe consolidation and sub-segmental pulmonary embolism necessitating treatment with heparin. Finally, after several weeks of escalating antimicrobial therapy and with additional drain placements, the retroperitoneal abscesses started to recede. Repeat abdominal imaging several months later while asymptomatic revealed slow but continuing resolution of the abscesses.",

MAIT cells can be identified by flow cytometry using a mAb directed against Valpha 7.2, which recognizes the product of the TRAV1-2 gene. By performing high throughput sequencing (HTS) of TRA rearrangements and flow cytometry, we have confirmed lack of T cells using distal Valpha genes in patients with known RAG mutations.

            "text": "Introduction: The fate of effector T cells is strongly dependent on the expression of Bcl-6 or Blimp-1, which are inhibited reciprocally through a complex signaling pathway. Several studies have shown that Bcl-6 is a key transcription factor for differentiation towards the follicular helper T cells (Tfh) lineage able to collaborate with B lymphocytes (BL). On the contrary, the transcription factor Blimp-1 is highly expressed in T lymphocytes Th1, Th2 and Treg, thus regulating the differentiation towards Tfh. Materials and methods: whole fresh blood and peripheral mononuclear cells from a patient with homozygous mutation in STAT5b were analysed by flow cytometry. Analysis of cTfh (CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5+), cTfh1 (CXCR3+), cTfh17 (CCR6+), cTfh2 (CXCR3-CCR6-), na\u00efve BL (LB IgM+IgD+CD27-), memory (MBL) (LB IgM+ IgD- CD27+), switched (MBL-Sw) (IgD-IgM-) and plasmablast (PBC) (CD27+CD38++) cells was performed. Immunoglobulins were measured in serum. Results: the patient with STAT5b deficiency showed increased values of cTfh (38%) (Healthy donors p10-p90: 7,9-17,8 %) that presented an activated phenotype (ICOS+ and PD-1+) with a skewed to a Th17 profile (CCR6+), consistent with her hipergammaglobulinemia and the marked and sustained increase in the switched MBL and PBC subpopulations in peripheral blood over the years. Discusion: This immunological phenotype described in the patient with STAT5b deficiency could explain in part the pathophysiology of the autoimmune disorders. This patient (as well as the other two patients with mutations in STAT5b previously described by our group), have had chronic hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibodies and consequently autoimmune processes (psoriasis, hypothyroidism, eczema, alopecia and celiac disease, among others). We believe that the link between this clinical symptomatology and the molecular defect relies in the fact that the absence of STAT5b promotes a greater expression of Bcl-6, which generates a bias towards the production of cTfh cells, that give rise to a greater activation of LB, generation of LBM and plasma cells (dysregulation in the CG), events that manifest as hypergammaglobulinemia and autoimmunity. In summary, we provide promising evidence of the mechanisms that lead to autoimmunity in this type of patients that could also be a consequence of the defect in the regulation of GC, highlighting the crucial role of STAT5b in the humoral immune response and maintenance of the tolerance of the immune system.",

A variant was reported in 76/341 cases (22.29%). These variants included variants of uncertain significance, likely pathogenic variants and pathogenic variants. The indication with the highest percentage of cases where a variant was reported was SCID (9/13 cases, 69.23%). The number of cases that were considered solved, where the genotype likely explains the patients phenotype, varied widely by indication. Twenty cases were found to have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant or variants; however 2/20 cases were heterozygotes for an autosomal recessive condition and were not considered solved cases. The panel with the highest percentage of solved cases is our SCID panel (4/13 cases, 30.77%). Conversely, we have yet to solve an autoinflammatory, irritable bowel disease, or telomere defects case; however ~20% of cases in each of those three panels have had a variant of uncertain significance reported. We hypothesize that one of the reasons for the low detection rate for these three panels is inappropriate test orders. We are also actively looking for ways to update all 8 panels to increase detection rates and clinical utility, for example expanding the gene list of our IBD panel, including large deletion/duplication detection, and including NCF1, a difficult gene to capture by NGS, on the phagocytic panel. Finally, we present the molecular findings from a number of interesting cases that were solved using our targeted NGS panels.",

However, clinical WES has major shortcomings that should be understood by practicing immunologists. Focusing on the 2017 IUIS list of ~330 monogenic primary immunodeficiency genes, we show here limitations in coverage that could significantly impact clinical interpretation. On the Agilent Whole Exome capture kit, the most common WES platform, there are a number of genes with exons that are poorly covered. Specifically, there are at least 94 genes with less than 100% exonic coverage, 26 with less than 99% coverage and 5 with less than 90% coverage (e.g. IKBKB, NCF1, TACI, UNC93B1 and TBX1). Beyond this challenging technical issue, there are more subtle issues as well. These include the presence of pseudogenes in at least 17 of our genes (e.g. AK2, C1QBP, CD46, CFTR, CR2, MSN, NCF1, NCSTN, IKBKG, NHP2, PMS2, PTEN, RNASEH2C, RPS, SBDS and WAS), which can make accurate sequencing very challenging. Finally, there are many known causative intronic (e.g. BTK, CTLA-4, WASP) and copy number variant mutations (e.g. RAG1 and XIAP) as well as large deletions (e.g. DOCK8) that we cannot expect to be optimally covered using WES. This list of genes requires consideration even with a negative exome and may require additional approaches including Whole Genome Sequencing, Sanger sequencing, CNV arrays and/or long-read NGS sequencing. WES is a powerful genomic diagnostic tool, but to avoid missing key diagnostic insights using these alternative approaches may be critical when certain genes are in the differential diagnosis. Going forward, as PID phenotypes continue to broaden, these issues remain fundamentally important even if these genes are not obviously implicated in a given clinical phenotype.",

Recently, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis in mice has disclosed an unexpected complexity of thymic stromal cells, and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) in particular. However, the developmental origin, hierarchy, and function of these subpopulations remain ill-defined. Moreover, although cortical TECs (cTECs) are thought to represent a more homogeneous population, their characterization has been largely restricted to the adult thymus. We have previously shown that impaired lymphostromal cross-talk in the thymus of patients with combined immunodeficiency (and of corresponding mouse models) is associated with abnormalities of thymic architecture and TEC maturation. Here, we sought to compare TEC distribution and gene expression in wild-type (WT) and in mice carrying Rag1 hypomorphic mutations observed in patients with combined immune deficiency and immune dysregulation.",

While MHC-IIhi mTECs are thought to represent a minor fraction of mTECs in adult WT mice and include mature AIRE+ cells, a relative abundance of MHC-IIhi mTECs is observed also at neonatal age, where they are thought to represent immature mTECs. To define more precisely TEC maturation, we performed scRNAseq on sorted CD45- EPCAM+ cells, and identified 8 and 10 distinct clusters of TECs in WT and Rag1 mutant mice, respectively. A large proportion of cells in Rag1 mutant mice could be ascribed to the cTEC compartment, confirming our previous flow cytometry and histopathology results. Furthermore, scRNAseq analysis also disclosed a different distribution of mTEC subsets in WT and Rag1 mutant mice. To address the hypothesis that this difference in cTEC and mTEC abundance and subset distribution may reflect different maturation stages in TEC development in WT and Rag1 mutant mice, we will perform lineage tracing and transplantation experiments, and we will also extend TEC scRNAseq analysis to WT and mutant mice of embryonic and neonatal age.

Pulmonary complications including bronchiectasis are common in common variable immune deficiency (CVID) and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in these patients. It remains unclear whether continued obstructive bronchial changes are a result of repeated respiratory infections, associated inflammation and immune dysregulation, or simply lung-damage that is irreversible by the time therapy is initiated. It has also been suggested that under-treatment in addition to the diagnostic delay may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis in patients with PID. Lower serum IgG levels with any given dose of immunoglobulin replacement therapy have been demonstrated in patients with bronchiectasis compared to those PID patients without this complication. In addition, earlier studies have shown that greater doses of Ig (600 mg/kg/ month) may reduce the frequency and duration of infections and help prevent or slow progression of chronic lung disease.",

He received one year of antimycobacterial therapy. He continued to have frequent, but mild, respiratory infections that resulted in approximately 2 missed school days per month, but did not require any hospitalizations. At the age of 22, he was diagnosed with multi-lobar pneumonia, which progressed to sepsis and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. One year later, he developed a second episode of pneumonia with sepsis requiring ICU admission. Subsequently, an immunodeficiency evaluation revealed an IgA of 40 mg/dL (70-400), IgG of 667 mg/dL (700-1600), IgM of 31 mg/dL (60-300), protection against 7/14 streptococcal pneumoniae serotypes, and protective Tetanus and Diptheria IgG antibodies (2.4 and 11.5 IU/mL, respectively). Quantitative lymphocytes subsets were significantly abnormal. They showed a CD45 of 0.47 K/mcL (0.82-2.84), CD3 of 300 cells/mcL (550-2202), CD4 of 197 cells/mcL (385-1437), CD8 of 97 cells/mcL (199-846) and CD 19 of 26 cells/mcL (91-409). Immature B cells (CD38lo/CD21lo) were elevated at 13.9% (0.5-8.0). Lymphocyte proliferation in response to PHA, Con A and PWM was 4-10x lower in the patient as compared to a healthy control. He was subsequently started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy and continued this for 1 year without any infections. Due to an insurance related lapse of IVIG infusion for 8 months, he developed another multi-lobar pneumonia requiring hospitalization. He is currently back on monthly IVIG replacement therapy and doing well. Comprehensive genetic testing for 207 known primary Immunodeficiency genes revealed one likely pathogenic heterozygous variant, c.310T>C (p.Cys104Arg) in TNFRSF13B (TACI), and three additional variants of uncertain significance: c.31G>A (p.Asp11Asn) in RAC2, c.237G>C (p.Gln79His) in TRAF3IP2, and c.4720G>A (p.Ala1574Thr) in VPS13B.",

Diagnoses included common variable immunodeficiency due to a pathogenic variant in NFKB2, STAT3 multiorgan autoimmunity due to gain-of-function mutation, and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome due to a pathogenic mutation in NLRP12. Biallelic DNMT3B VUS were found in a patient whose phenotype and further laboratory studies (including karyotype) were consistent with immunodeficiency-centromeric instability, facial anomalies syndrome. Further, a STAT3 VUS was identified in a patient with multiorgan autoimmunity and his father with hypothyroidism; studies from an outside research laboratory were consistent with gain-of-function with this variant (private communication). An additional three patients had VUS identified that were suspected to be related to their phenotype, prompting eligibility for research studies. Four (17%) patients had increased risk alleles in NOD2, conferring an increased risk of Crohns disease.

However, many patients lack a fully-matched unaffected sibling, or may have an unknown underlying genetic defect, rendering it undesirable to use related donors. Many PID patients have significant comorbidities at the time they are referred to alloHCT, precluding the use of myeloablative conditioning. The use of alternative donors with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has historically led to increased rates of graft failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and transplant-related mortality (TRM). Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as GVHD prophylaxis immunomodulates the graft through the preferential sparing of regulatory T cells and hematopoietic stem cells from its cytotoxic effects, thus allowing for robust donor engraftment that overcomes the HLA barrier while effectively preventing severe acute and chronic GVHD. We report the outcomes of two institutions using a RIC alloHCT regimen with alternative donors and PTCy in patients with PID.",

There were 10 patients who developed acute GVHD, grade 1 (n=5) or grade 2 (n=5), and there were no cases of grade 3 or 4 aGVHD. Seven of eight patients treated with systemic corticosteroids responded, and one was corticosteroid-dependent, then responded to second-line therapy. One patient developed skin-only chronic GVHD, which responded to corticosteroids and PUVA light therapy. Five patients developed graft failure, either primary (n=1) or secondary (n=4), and four were successfully re-transplanted and remain engrafted. One patient with secondary graft failure had autologous recovery and has not required a second alloHCT given some durable infection control gained during initial engraftment.

Two-third of CGD cases are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CYBB gene that encodes the gp91pox subunit of the NADPH. The increased in patients' life expectancy thanks to progress in diagnosis and management has underlined the burden of inflammatory manifestations occurring independently of infectious agents (Dunogue et al., 2017; Marciano et al., 2018). CGD patients develop inflammatory granulomatous disorders, notably colitis, as a consequence of a dysregulated inflammasome activation. The treatment of inflammatory manifestations remains challenging, as it can be associated with an increased risk of infections. Thus, understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of auto-inflammation in CGD could help improve the therapeutic arsenal for the management of these manifestations. To reveal the precise pathophysiological mechanism of auto-inflammation in CGD, we have developed a cellular model that reproduces the CGD phenotype in phagocytic cell. Through CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing we generated a THP-1 cell line harboring the previously described mutation c.90_92delCCGinsGGT (p.Tyr30Ter) in the CYBB gene responsible for gp91phox knock-out by early termination of translation. This cell line recapitulates the phenotype of CGD phagocytes: (i) decreased H2O2 production (ii) and enhanced inflammatory responses after PMA stimulation as evidenced by increased IL-1, IL-6 and TNFa secretion levels (Kuijpers & Lutter, 2012). These features were rescued by complementation through lentiviral transduction of a wild type CYBB gene. This new model will help us to investigate the auto-inflammation reported in CGD patients and also to propose new therapeutic targets of inflammatory manifestations in this disorder.",

At age 9 months she began having low grade fevers and was found to have a hemoglobin of 4 prompting urgent hospital admission for transfusion. Hematology sent testing for bone marrow failure syndromes, with suspicion for Diamond Blackfan anemia. She required PRBC transfusion roughly once every 2-3 weeks. At 11 months of age she became pancytopenic and had an urgent hospital admission. Immunology and GI were first consulted at this time. Due to persistently poor weight gain GI performed a colonoscopy which revealed IBD. Initial immune evaluation revealed hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG = 82 mg/dL, IgA = 7 mg/dL, and IgM = 32 mg/dL), nonprotective titers to HiB, pneumococcus, and diphtheria despite vaccination, and the patient received IVIG. She was also panlymphopenic (CD3 = 1092, CD4 = 837, CD8=253, CD19 = 31, CD16/56=7).

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an obstructing 13 mm right renal stone with hydronephrosis and a right renal abscess contiguous with a right-sided hepatic abscess measuring 7.8 x 6.0 x 7.5 cm. She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole, and underwent imaging-guided drainage of the abscesses. Abscess cultures again grew resistant E. coli. She was discharged from the hospital with drains in place and a plan to continue trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole until definitive management of her nephrolithiasis with ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.",

Case 1: A 10-year-old female was referred to NIAID for neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). Developmental delay and mild intellectual disability were appreciated on clinical evaluation. Exome sequencing detected a mosaic novel likely pathogenic variant in NLRP3. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) showed a ~5 Mb interstitial deletion of chromosome 12 previously associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability. Case 2: A 10-year-old Ukrainian male was referred to NIAID for the clinical diagnosis of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). Exome sequencing and CMA did not detect pathogenic variants in AIRE, but did find a de novo variant in FAM111B. Defects in FAM111B are associated with poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP). The clinical features of the patient were consistent with POIKMP. Case 3: A 63-year-old man had a history of brain, liver and kidney nocardiosis, disseminated MAC infection, prostate cancer and lymphoma. Family history was significant for prostate cancer. Exome sequencing showed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BRCA2, associated with susceptibility to breast-ovarian, male breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer.",

            "text": "Gain-of-function mutations in PI3Kd result in a human primary immunodeficiency, named APDS (Activated PI3K-delta syndrome), characterized by lymphopenia, lymphoproliferation, respiratory infections and inefficient responses to vaccination. However, what promotes these immune disturbances at the cellular and molecular level remains unknown. We have recently published a mouse model that recapitulates major features of this disease and used this model and patient samples to probe how hyperactive PI3Kd fosters aberrant humoral immunity. We found that mutant PI3Kd alters the intrinsic function of T and B cells, leading to ICOS-independent increases in T follicular helper (Tfh) and germinal center (GC) B cells, disorganized GCs, and poor class-switched antigen-specific responses to immunization. These phenotypes were associated with increased phosphorylation of AKT and S6 in T and B cells, and lower threshold of activation, with altered regulation of FOXO1 and BCL2 family members. Moreover, B cells showed enhanced responsiveness and proliferation to both antigens and innate stimuli, accompanied by reduced cell death. Strikingly, aberrant responses were accompanied by increased reactivity to gut bacteria, and a broad increase in autoantibodies that were dependent on commensal microbial stimulation, as demonstrated by striking reduction of self-reactivity upon antibiotic treatment in mutant mice. We now have further examined B cell function in these mice and demonstrate that altered FOXO1 plays a major role in disruption of both B and T cell function. We further provide evidence for altered activation of metabolic pathways in B cells, compared to WT cells, that may contribute to the dysregulated B cell reactivity. Our findings suggest that proper PI3Kd regulation is critical for ensuring optimal host-protective humoral immunity despite tonic stimulation from the commensal microbiome.",

Eight days prior to presentation, he was seen by his pediatrician for facial rash and low grade temperature, and was diagnosed with hand-foot-and mouth disease. He worsened on empiric antibiotics. He had no history of sinopulmonary infections. He did not attend daycare. His vaccines were delayed due to parental choice, and he had not received live vaccines (Rotavirus, MMR or VZV). Full sepsis evaluation was performed. CSF demonstrated pleocytosis, and he was started on empiric antibiotics and transferred to PICU. Due to worsening abdominal pain, CT of the abdomen was performed, which was consistent with ruptured appendicitis and septic emboli at the lung bases. CSF PCR panel was positive for HHV-6 and he was started on Gancyclovir. CSF and blood cultures subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Immune evaluation was performed. Serum immunoglobulins were undetectable. In addition to IV antibiotics, he received 500 mg/kg IVIG and lymphocyte subsets revealed profound B cell lymphopenia (0.23 %, 5 cells/uL). BTK protein analysis revealed hemizygous BTK pathogenic variant confirming the diagnosis of X-Linked agammaglobulinemia. The hospital course was further complicated by brain abscesses and pyoventriculitis. He was treated with 3 additional doses of 500 mg/kg IVIG and IV antibiotics. Repeat MRI of the brain nearly 4 weeks after admission demonstrated significant improvement. There was significant clinical recovery. He was discharged home at baseline neurological status. His IgG level upon discharge home was 605 mg/dL with the plan to increase dose to 600 mg/kg per month with close monitoring.",

The mechanisms that lead to a breakdown of self-tolerance in CVID are not completely understood. However some differences in B and T cells subsets and autoreactive B and T cells can be detected. Elevated expression of surface IgD and downregulation of IgM receptor are hallmarks of anergic na\u00efve B cells that contain autoreactive receptors in human peripheral blood. Moreover, memory B cells that have class switched to IgD and present an IgD+IgM- phenotype are also highly reactive to self-antigens in healthy individuals. The role of these autoreactive na\u00efve and memory B cells in the immunopathogenesis of CVID has not been evaluated.

The incidence of Cryptosporidia is likely under-represented due to more recent availability of sensitive assays for Cryptosporidia detection. Other liver abnormalities included fatty liver, metastatic disease from malignancy and medication related hepatitis.

Eight of them manifested T cell lymphopenia, and 5 presented with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or Omenn syndrome. Using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a model, we have previously reported that EXTL3 mutations affect differentiation to thymic epithelial progenitor cells as well as expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Consistent with the latter, previous studies have suggested that mutations in other genes involved in HS biosynthesis affect hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation.

Patients with FMF have elevation in acute phase reactants during attacks with most returning to normal levels during the episode-free periods. Multiple studies have shown that patient with FMF have lower bone mineral density and Z-scores than the general population. Inflammation in FMF is thought to be mediated by several different cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-11, IL-15 and TNF-).

Eight weeks earlier he developed fever to 104F, mouth sores and exudative tonsillitis; a rapid strep screen was negative. One week later he developed moderate cervical lymphadenopathy and had a positive EBV Early Antigen antibody.. One month later he had several severe local reactions to mosquito bites. Each manifested 6-8 cm of erythema and induration with a 1+ cm bullae which left an ulcer after rupture and healed with a hypopigmented scar. The bites were accompanied by fever to 104F for 4 days. One febrile episode was treated with low dose prednisolone for presumed PFAPA, and the fever resolved within hours. His past history was positive for nasal allergy and mild asthma. His parents are not related: mom is of European-Indonesian and dad European-African (Creole ancestry. Testing prior to this visit showed normal IgG, IgA and IgM, elevated IgE (12,000 U/L) and normal CBC. Lymphocyte subsets revealed CD3+ 23% (1538/mcL), CD4+ 17% (1109/mcL), CD8+ 6% (363/mcL), CD19+ 9% (587/mcL), NK cells 67% (4435/mcL). On examination he appeared well with height at 86th%ile and weight at 58th%ile. There was no lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly or inflammed skin lesions; there was a 1cm round scar on the right plantar surface at the site of a prior mosquito bite. Laboratory studies confirmed NK lymphocytosis 64% (5459/mcL) and elevated IgE (29,600 U/L). Lymphoproliferation to mitogens, CD3/CD28, CMV and HSV were normal, but absent to tetanus and candida antigens. EBV antibodies reflected past infection (VCA-IgG+, VCA-IgM-, EBNA+); quantitative EBV PCR was >5,000,000 copies/mL whole blood. NK cytotoxicity and CD107a expression were decreased. Bone marrow NK analysis suggested conality. The patient was diagnosed with \"hypersensitivity to mosquito bites with EBV-associated T-/NK lymphoproliferation.\" This disorder represents a subset of chronic active EBV (CAEBV) that is rarely seen outside of East Asia. The lack of organomegaly or lymphadenopathy with hyper-IgE and NK lymphocytosis and decreased NK function support the likelihood that NK cells are the target of EBV infection in this patient. This diagnosis may be a precursor to hemophagocytosis, liver necrosis or lymphoma/leukemia, and the only curative treatment is bone marrow transplantation. The patient's sister is a 10/10 HLA match. She is seropositive for past EBV infection, and she has no history of extreme reactions to mosquito bites. Genetic mutations that cause familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis have not been reported in CAEBV, and to the best of our knowledge familial cases of this disorder have not been identified. The response to BMT in this patient is pending.",

Awareness of the disease and its course is important to prevent unnecessary expanded immunodeficiency work-up and possible procedures to eliminate lesions. Although mucosal immunity can be site specific, especially with HPV, our understanding of T-cell cytokine and chemokine responses to HPV in cervical and laryngeal lesions may be instructive. The mechanism which allows HPV persistence in MEH is not characterized, but it likely is due to increased viral persistence and an inability for the host immune response to successfully induce viral latency and successful containment. Elevated TNF levels, with normal levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, may correlate with decreased clearance of HPV and prolonged duration of MEH. It remains unclear if viral persistence is the cause of, or the sequela of, increased TNF. Longitudinal monitoring of cytokine (TNF, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) and chemokine (CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, and CCL22) serum concentrations may be useful biomarkers for disease resolution.",

Recently, specific heterozygous BCL11B mutations have been reported in 11 individuals with global development delay.

While mitogen responses to ConA and PHA were normal, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were decreased, especially CD4+ na\u00efve and CD4+CD31+ na\u00efve T cells, suggesting reduced thymic output. The function of TH1 cells was skewed with reduced IL-2 production but increased IFN levels after PMA and ionomycin stimulation. Moreover, T regulatory cell counts were below normal range. NK cell counts were normal but these were mostly CD56bright NK cells. Of the few CD56dim NK cells that presented, approximately half did not express CD16, the Fc receptor for ADCC.

Owing to diminished degradation of not only S1P, but also other sphingoid bases, deleterious mutations in SGPL1 (encoding S1P lyase) perturb sphingolipid catabolism in numerous tissues. Correspondingly, human S1P lyase deficiency results in multiorgan dysfunction including kidney, skin, endocrine gland, and neurologic impairment alongside expected lymphopenia. Although severe T cell lymphopenia (<300 cells/microliter) rivaling that of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) can be seen in patients with S1P lyase deficiency, no such patients have been identified by newborn screening of T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) counts, which are a surrogate measure of effective T cell production. Herein, we describe an infant boy with an undetectable TREC count at birth who was found to have two novel, biallelic SGPL1 mutations resulting in S1P lyase deficiency.",

Subsequent peripheral blood studies show profound lymphopenia, with diminished CD3+ T (129/microliter; 96 CD4+, 27 CD8+), CD19+ B (130/microliter), and CD16/56+ natural killer (124/microliter) cell counts. Recent thymic emigrants are reduced (11.3% of CD4+ T cells are CD45RA+CD31+), as is the ratio of na\u00efve-to-memory CD4+ T cells (63% CD45RA+, 37% CD45RO+). Expedited whole genome sequencing identifies two novel variants in SGPL1 a paternally inherited splice site variant (c.1566+2T>C) predicted to impact a canonical splice donor site, and a maternally inherited missense change (c.854G>A; p.Cys285Tyr) located in a well-established functional domain of S1P. In addition to nephrotic syndrome and lymphopenia, the patient displays evidence of adrenal insufficiency and has increased plasma levels of sphingoid bases and ceramides.

As a child, she experienced multiple ear and sinus infections, along recurrent warts on her upper and lower extremities that have persisted to this day. Furthermore, during a routine examination when she was 14-years-old, she had a complete blood count drawn significant for leukopenia. No further workup was undertaken at that time. When continued leukopenia was noted at the age of 30, referral to a hematologist and a bone marrow biopsy was completed. Bone marrow was significant for myelokathexis with borderline hypercellular marrow for patient age (80% cellularity), and normal cell line quantity. A trial of neupoegen was undertaken, without significant improvement. Her family history is significant for father and brother with both leukopenia and recurrent warts.",

On genetic analysis, she is noted to have a pathogenic mutation of the CXCR4 gene. The substitution of a phenylalanine for a serine decreases one of the seven serine phosphorylation sites in the carboxy tail of the molecule that occurs upon binding to its ligand, CXCL12 (SDF1). Additionally, the variation generates a premature stop condon terminating the remainder of the carboxy terminal amino acids including Ser346-7, known to have a role in carboxy terminial beta-arrestin binding. Failure to generate adequate beta-arrestin binding sites leads to prolonged CXCR4 CXCL12 interaction resulting in myelokathexis.",

Following a hypoglycemic seizure at age 20, the patient was diagnosed with isolated ACTH insufficiency with secondary adrenal insufficiency requiring hormone substitution. During and following her first pregnancy at age 25, she suffered from recurrent bronchopneumonias including Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, resulting in bronchiectases documented on chest CT at age 30. Currently, chronic lung disease is severely limiting her quality of life (Table 1). Her daughter was noticed to be hypogammaglobulinemic soon after birth and failed to develop antibody responses to inactivated vaccines. She was started on immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

This monoallelic loss-of function frameshift mutation was not found in gnomad, GVS Washington or ClinVar databases. As previously published, a monoallelic mutation in this c-terminal domain leads to impaired phosphorylation and subsequent reduced nuclear translocation of the NFKB2/p52 active form. Pediatricians and internal specialists need to be aware of the combination of hypogammaglobulinemia, ACTH deficiency, immune dysregulation and ectodermal dysplasia which is unusual for CVID - possibly indicating NFKB2 deficiency. This clinical syndrome may overlap with symptoms and signs found in both APECED/AIRE (AR) and EDA-ID/NFKBIA (AD) deficiencies. Besides IG and hormone replacement therapy, curative treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a therapeutic option for patients with NFKB2 deficiency, although the experience is limited.",

To assess a potential association between the administration route at comparable IgG trough levels and the infection rate, IgG trough levels were categorized as 500 <700mg/dL, 700<900mg/dL, 900<1100mg/dL, 1100<1300 mg/dL, 1300 <1500 mg/dL and 1500 mg/dL. Periods where patients had trough levels within these strata were assessed, and the infection frequency was calculated. The time periods for this analysis were 3 months for IVIG and 12 months each for IGHy and SCIG 10% (2.25 years) treatments. In order to account for differences in the frequency of administration, rates of systemic and local AEs were assessed as AEs/patient-year for each mode of therapy.",

She was admitted one month later with similar clinical symptoms with relapsed HHV6 infection. Furthermore, hemophagocytosis was found in the bone marrow and evaluation of NK cell cytotoxicity demonstrated slightly reduced cytotoxic activity. Functional studies for primary FHL were performed: perforin expression and CD107a surface expression were normal. She fulfilled criteria of FHL, and treatment with gancyclovir and steroids was administered. Despite this treatment, she persisted with activated macrophagic parameters, and started with HLH2014 treatment protocol. She improved the clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters, but persisted with HHV6 low viremia. Three months later, when immunosupression was decreased, she was readmitted with similar clinical manifestations and added neurological symptoms (facial paralysis, abnormal movements and sleep tendency). Cerebral spinal fluid was pathological with HHV6 positive rescue. Immunosupresive treatment was adjusted, but HHV6 copies in blood increased markedly. Foscarnet treatment was administered and immunosupression was suspended for 2 days in order to control viral infection. Unfortunately the patient died 6 days later.",

Transbronchial biopsy showed nonspecific pneumonitis and organizing pneumonia. Antinuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies were positive. He received prednisone for presumed lupus pneumonitis leading to improvement. Prednisone was tapered and hydroxychloroquine was started, but his fevers, pleuritic pain and pleural effusion reoccurred. Genetic testing revealed a NOD2 sequent variant (R702W) associated with autoinflammatory disease. Hydroxychloroquine was stopped and colchicine was added to his regimen, allowing prednisone to be tapered without recurrence of symptoms. Further immunological testing revealed increased signaling through the type I interferon receptor (interferon signature).",

The impacts of SDM on clinical outcomes were discussed in 59 studies; 15 were reviewed in detail in acute (n = 7), chronic (n = 5), and general/other (n = 3) conditions. Two studies suggested that SDM may improve clinical outcomes in chronic diseases. In 4 studies, patients who participated in SDM used fewer diagnostic tests and medications and underwent fewer intensive tests and treatments for acute illness. Positive effects of SDM were reported in mental health settings, for patients with chronic illness or making longer-term decisions, and in cases in which SDM interventions occurred over multiple sessions. No studies were found that evaluated SDM in the treatment of PIDD. In a survey of US immunologists (n = 15), participants acknowledged the value of SDM; however, in another survey, patient preferences for IGRT were not the same as what physicians perceived of their patients preferences, underscoring a need for SDM in PID.",

HCT and GT are not therapeutic options for all ADA-SCID patients and ERT offers immediate therapeutic intervention for these patients leading to partial immune reconstitution, and durable survival in most patients treated. Adagen (pegademase), approved by the FDA in 1990 in the USA, is a pegylated bovine ADA (nADA) with the enzyme harvested from bovine intestines.

Other anti-cytokine antibodies were less common (IFN-omega 44%, IL-12 33%). Similarly, children between 10-18 yo age (n=9) also had high fraction of anti-IFN-alpha antibodies (89%) with prior history of infections (66%) and continued to have other anti-cytokine antibodies less commonly (IFN-omega 37%, IL-12 62%).

Anti-IFN-alpha may serve as a useful biomarker for identifying partial RAG deficiency among young and adult patients with history of viral infections and autoimmune cytopenias. The role of these antibodies to cytokines is yet to be determined but a specific signature of these antibodies may help to identify an underlying immunodeficiency and initiate early definitive treatment with bone marrow transplantation.

The average number of BM/day in all patients was 8.4 (range 2-20). Eight patients received POIG (250-500 mg/Kg) weekly for a duration from 1-12 weeks. Three of those received additional Nitazoxanide and 2 received Ribavirin. 2/8 patients in the POIG group were receiving Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), and 4/19 on no treatment group received TPN. The average number of BM/day in POIG before treatment was 9.5 (range 4-16), and 8.6 (range 2-20) in those who did not receive any treatment. 5 of 8 (62%) on POIG vs. 11 of 19 (57%) in the no treatment group cleared the virus. The average number of weeks to return to baseline BM was 2.6 (range 1-7) in the POIG group vs. 1.5 (range 3 days-5 weeks) in the no treatment group. 2 of 8 on POIG continued to have chronic diarrhea that is still ongoing.",

Until recently, there have been no FDA approved treatments for HLH, and standard dexamethasone/etoposide-based treatment has not evolved significantly in 20+ years.

Subsequent doses could be increased up to 10 mg/kg based on the evolution of response parameters. Dexamethasone was administered concomitantly at 5 to 10 mg/m2/day and could be tapered during the study. Treatment duration was 8 weeks, with possible shortening to a minimum of 4 weeks, or extension up to the time of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) at end of treatment, assessed by pre-defined objective parameters, including normalization or at least 50% improvement from baseline of fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, fibrinogen, D-dimer, central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, and with no sustained worsening of sCD25 serum levels. The primary analysis used an exact binomial test to evaluate the null hypothesis that ORR be 40% at a one-sided 0.025 significance level. Patients were eligible to enter an extension phase for follow-up after completing the main study (NCT02069899). The data cut-off applied is July 20 2017.",

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated marked retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in the superior retina, consistent with the known inferior visual field defect, both findings characteristic of NAION. Treatment with IV steroids produced little improvement in vision, but there was no further progression. Two years later the patient began experiencing recurrent high fevers and developed splenomegaly. Elevated transaminases and concern for lymphoproliferative disease prompted a splenectomy and liver biopsy. Both the spleen and liver biopsy were positive for EBV but were negative for malignancy. Bone marrow biopsy was unrevealing. Genetic testing identified a pathogenic variant in XIAP/ BIRC4 (1141C>T), and the patient was treated with high dose oral steroids resulting in an improvement in symptoms. Subsequently, therapy with anakinra was started and steroids were tapered. During the steroid taper, he noticed a change in the vision of his left eye consistent with NAION, as well as worsening of his colitis. There was loss of the inferior visual field and fundoscopic exam was significant for left optic disc swelling. OCT noted superior retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. Oral steroids were restarted with improvement in optic disc swelling, but without improvement or change in vision. As of his most recent exam, the patient has persistent bilateral inferior visual field defects with segmental optic nerve atrophy typical of NAION.

We hypothesize that his hyper-inflammatory condition contributed to irreversible vascular damage in the optic nerve head, resulting in NAION.

Whole exome sequencing has been a powerful tool to resolve and explain the genetic basis of novel syndromes in immune related diseases. However, proving causation can be complicated due to low number of the affected individuals. We performed whole exome sequencing in a cohort of patients with non-congenital immune defects, along with detailed cellular biochemical phenotyping. We report and describe a novel non-congenital combined immune deficiency arising from a de novo gain-of-function mutation in IKBKB(c.607G>A). This gene encodes IKK2, and activates canonical NFKB signalling. Cellular and biochemical studies of the proband revealed that IKK2V203I results in enhanced NF-kB signaling, as well as T and B cell functional defects. IKK2V203 is a highly-conserved residue, and to prove causation, we generated a CRISPR/cas9 mouse model that carry the precise orthologous missense mutation. We show that mice and humans carrying this missense mutation exhibits remarkably similar cellular and biochemical phenotypes.",

In most cases mutation on FAS gene are responsible of the disease and the phenotype of individuals carrying the same variants can vary from asymptomatic/mild forms to severe disease, due to incomplete penetrance of pathogenic mutations. More rarely, other genes involved in this pathway, such as CASP10, are mutated. Few clinical and molecular data have been reported on patients carrying CASP10 mutation showing that different genetic variations can produce contrasting phenotypic effects. So far, 2 mutations have been recognized as pathogenic (I406L and L258F) and other have been reported with controversial result on their pathogenicity (V410l, Y446C) or are known to be polymorphic variants (L522l)",

He contracted hepatitis C virus (HCV) in childhood through blood products, which progressed to cirrhosis with portal hypertension. He is one of 14 affected male family members, all others deceased due to XLP1 including his brother, who had HCV cirrhosis, and developed lymphoma. Our patient achieved sustained virologic response through treatment of HCV with Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir. Given his high risk of lymphoma, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for cure of XLP1 was desired, but was precluded by cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Liver transplant was precluded by XLP1, due to concerns for infection and PTLD. His fully HLA matched sister volunteered to donate liver and bone marrow, in hopes of addressing both issues. Living related liver transplant was performed at University of Pennsylvania, followed 3 months later by allogeneic HSCT. Posttransplant he had an anastomotic biliary duct stricture requiring stenting, and chronic GVHD affecting skin and oral mucosa, well controlled on rapamycin. He has not had evidence of parenchymal liver disease or PTLD. Donor chimerism is 94%-96% in T, B and myeloid cells, and he has normal SAP protein expression in CD8+T cells and natural killer cells.

In some cases, cDNA analysis of relative allelic expression has demonstrated reduced or absent transcript from one allele leading to haploinsufficiency. Patients still remain however who are suspicious for GATA2 deficiency with no mutation identified and uninformative transcript assays, often due to lack of heterozygosity of SNPs within the cDNA. GATA2 is tightly regulated, with highest expression occurring during early hematopoietic development and in hematopoietic stem cells; expression is lower or absent in fully differentiated cells making detection and functional assays challenging. We sought to evaluate GATA2 target transcripts as surrogates to determine a pattern of dysregulation in patients. Total RNA isolated from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells was reverse transcribed to generate cDNA. We selected four known GATA2 transcriptional targets, GATA1, GATA2, TAL1 and ZFPM1 (encoding FOG1) and used droplet digital PCR to quantify transcript levels normalized to the low-expressing gene TBP1. We used samples from 9 individuals with wild-type GATA2 (WT), 5 known GATA2 mutation patients (Mut) and two individuals suspected of GATA2 deficiency but without identified mutation or allelic imbalance (Unk1, Unk2).",

In the first case (Unk1) a 51 yr old female with primary lymphedema, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections and possible family history of leukemia was referred for GATA2 testing. No mutation was identified however it was noted that she was homozygous across the gene preventing allelic evaluation. The second patient (Unk2), a 24 yr old female, had erethemya nodosa on legs, Mycobacteria kansasii and cytopenias. In each of the targets analyzed, transcript levels from Unk1 were lower than the WT samples and in a similar range as the GATA2 mutation samples while Unk2 had a profile consistent with the WT samples.

A subset of these patients possesses defects in NK cells, innate lymphocytes which recognize and lyse herpesvirus-infected cells; however, the exact genetic etiologies are rarely diagnosed. PLCG2 encodes a signaling protein in NK cell and B cell receptor-mediated signaling. Dominant-negative or gain-of-function mutations in PLCG2 cause cold urticaria, antibody deficiency, or autoinflammation. However, loss-of-function mutations and PLCG2 haploinsufficiency have never been reported in human disease. We examined 2 families with autosomal dominant NK cell immunodeficiency with mass cytometry and whole-exome sequencing to identify the cause of disease. We identified two novel heterozygous loss-of-function mutations inPLCG2 that impaired NK cell function, including calcium flux, granule movement, and target killing. Although expression of mutant PLCG2 protein in vitro was normal, phosphorylation of both mutants was diminished. In contrast to PLAID and APLAID, B cell function remained intact. Plcg2+/- mice, as well as targeted CRISPR knock-in mice, also displayed impaired NK cell function with preserved B cell function, phenocopying human PLCG2 haploinsufficiency. We report the first known cases of PLCG2 haploinsufficiency, a clinically and mechanistically distinct syndrome from previously reported mutations. Therefore, these families represent a novel disease, highlighting a role for PLCG2 haploinsufficiency in herpesvirus-susceptible patients and expanding the spectrum of PLCG2-related disease.",

All three patients maintain full donor myeloid chimerism at the latest testing (9 months 18 months); T cell chimerism was 100% in one and mixed in two patients (91% at nine months, 80% at 12 months). All three patients had excellent T cell immune reconstitution; Two patients came off immunoglobulin replacement 5 -11 months post HSCT, whereas the 3rd patient is IVIG dependent, though IgA level was 25 mg/dL at nine months post-transplantation. Latest evaluation, 9 18 months post-HSCT, revealed 27% - 63% CD40L expressing activated CD4 T cells, which correlated with donor CD40L expression and T-cell chimerism.",

Comparing clinical data reveals a significant correlation with the high IgG responders and a family history of asthma and maternal gestational diabetes.

Lower level of SHM likely reflect abnormal germinal center (GC) reaction. As RAG1 and 2 heterotetramer primarily shapes the pre-immune T and B cell repertoire, we studied the interaction of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and naive B cells via in vitro co-culture experiment. Interestingly, Tfh cells from RAG CID/AI patients exhibited highly activated phenotype with increased expression of CD40L and IL-21 compared to healthy controls and were able to initiate exaggerated response (class switching and SHM) of healthy donor naive B cells. On the contrary, in vitro activated naive B cells from RAG CID/AI patients showed impaired proliferation, class switching and decreased level of SHM with diminished induction of genes involved T cell co-stimulation (CD40, IL-21R) and SHM (AICDA, repair enzymes) compared to healthy donor naive B cells indicating intrinsic defect in patient B cells. Furthermore, B cells from RAG CID/AI patients also showed increased apoptosis and accumulation of Gamma-H2AX foci at steady state indicating reduced cellular fitness.",

A functional characterization of the diverse Foxn1 mutations suggests that the severity of the block in thymopoiesis depends on whether the mutations affect the DNA binding or transactivation domains of Foxn1. A 5-amino acid segment at the end of the DNA binding domain appears to be essential for TEC development. However, this segment is not required for normal keratinocyte functions in the skin and nail plate.

However, the role of anti-IL-6-AutoAbs is less clear. IL-6 is a key mediator of the acute-phase response and released early in bacterial infections. Patients with impaired signaling or affected production of IL-6 are at increased risk for severe bacterial infections. Only three patients with high-titer and neutralizing anti-IL-6-AutoAbs who suffered from severe infections caused by S. aureus, S. intermedius and E. coli have been described so far. To investigate the prevalence of anti-IL-6-AutoAbs in patients with bacterial infections, we investigated a cohort of 350 patients and identified three further patients, all previously healthy, with neutralizing auotAbs against IL-6 who hardly developed an acute-phase response. The first patient suffered from life-threatening pneumonia caused by S. pneumonia, the second patient developed a submandibular abscess and septic arthritis caused by S. pyogenes and the third patient suffered from life-threatening pneumonia caused by S. aureus. We also discovered neutralizing anti-IL-6-AutoAbs in two adults among a cohort of patients with autoimmune diseases (n = 564), in one adolescent among a cohort of obese individuals (n = 455) as well as in three mothers of neonates with impaired IL-6 signaling. So far none of the later individuals developed a severe bacterial infection. This suggests that naturally occurring and neutralizing anti-IL-6-AutoAbs are a risk factor for severe bacterial infections yet with incomplete penetrance.",

The COP protein, encoded for by the COPA gene, is expressed in all cell types and is involved in trafficking from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (1). The most common clinical features of COPA syndrome are interstitial lung disease, pulmonary cysts or follicular bronchiolitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, arthritis, glomerular disease, and autoantibody development (2, 3). Atypical features of COPA syndrome identified thus far include: extrapulmonary cysts in the liver and kidney, renal and neuroendocrine malignancies, autoimmune neurological disorders such as neuromyelitis optica, and infections, such as meningitis (4).",

The transaminitis was noted prior to diagnosis of COPA syndrome, and has persisted despite seven months of therapy with pulse dose steroids, two cycles of rituximab and maintenance therapy with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. He has had a normal CK and aldolase excluding muscle injury as a source of his transaminitis. A congenital cholestasis panel was normal. Markers of autoimmune liver disease including ANA, anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and anti-smooth muscle were negative. Serum ceruloplasmin and alpha-1-antitrypsin level were normal and celiac serologies, were negative. Liver ultrasound was normal. A liver biopsy did not demonstrate inflammatory changes, hepatocyte necrosis, mononuclear cell infiltrates or fibrosis. Nonspecific biopsy findings included occasional intraparenchymal neutrophils. It is unclear if these scattered neutrophils and the transaminitis are due to an early as yet unidentified autoimmune process, perhaps in response to hepatocellular stress exacerbated by the COPA mutation.",

The database was obtained by conducting an electronic search on MedSys of patients with the term immunodeficiency in their electronic medical records, and then hand-picking cases in which an IEI had been confirmed or ruled out. It consisted of 234 patients, of which 201 had been diagnosed with IEI. We first split the dataset randomly into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. The decision tree was tasked with classifying correctly PID or NOT. After running the algorithm in the training set, we evaluated in the testing set. The random forest classified all cases by majority vote into nine groups (0 to 8), according to the IUIS PID group. Next, we repeated the process on a larger scale with a dataset of 2,400 patients from USIDNET. Accuracy was assessed by out-of-bag (OOB) error estimates.",

DNA Ligase 4-deficient patients suffer from a wide range of clinical manifestations since early in life, including: microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, growth failure, developmental delay, mental retardation; hip dysplasia, and other skeletal malformations; as well as a severe combined immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity and progressive bone marrow failure; or, they may present later in life with hematological neoplasias that respond catastrophically to chemo- and radiotherapy; or, they could be asymptomatic. We describe the clinical, laboratory and genetic features of five Mexican patients with LIG4 deficiency, together with a review of 36 other patients available in PubMed Medline. Four out of five of our patients are dead from lymphoma or bone marrow failure, with severe infection and massive bleeding; the fifth patient is asymptomatic despite a persistent CD4+ lymphopenia. Most patients reported in the literature are microcephalic females with growth failure, sinopulmonary infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, very low B-cells, and radiosensitivity; while bone marrow failure and malignancy may develop at a later age. Dysmorphic facial features, congenital hip dysplasia, chronic liver disease, gradual pancytopenia, lymphoma or leukemia, thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported as well. Most mutations are compound heterozygous, and all of them are hypomorphic, with two common truncating mutations accounting for the majority of patients. Stem-cell transplantation after reduced intensity conditioning regimes may be curative.",

Based on the clinical and immunologic phenotype, our cohort of 80 patients from 66 families represented a wide spectrum of RAG deficiencies, including SCID (n=19), OS (n=36), AS (n=21) and CID-G/AI (n=4). Sixty-six (82.5%) patients carried RAG1 and 14 patients (17.5%) carried RAG2 biallelic variants. We estimate that the minimal annual incidence of RAG deficiency in Slavic countries varies between 1 in 180,000 300,000 live birth and it may vary secondary to health care disparities in these regions. In our cohort, 70% of the patients carried RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 (c.256_257delAA), either in homozygous (n=17, 26%) or compound heterozygous (n=29, 44%) form. The majority (77%) of patients with homozygous RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 originated from Vistula watershed area in Central and Eastern Poland, and compound heterozygote cases distributed among all Slavic countries except Bulgaria. Clinical and immunological presentation of homozygous RAG1 p.K86Vfs*33 cases was highly diverse suggestive of strong influence of other genetic and/or epigenetic factors in shaping the final phenotype. Survival of RAG deficient patients without hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (n=3, 8.8%) is poor and dramatically improved in the last decade with access to HSCT and tailored conditioning regimens.",

The donor was a 70 year-old man who died from anoxic brain injury. The receiver was induced with basiliximab and then put on prednisone, azathioprine and tacrolimus. He was readmitted 10 weeks later for myalgia, headache, fever and neutropenia. Clinical state initially improved with empiric antibiotics. He then developed a skin eruption, colitis and DIC. The latter was thought to be tacrolimus-induced. He was switched to cyclosporine. Skin and rectosigmoid biopsies were compatible with acute GvHD. He received basiliximab and IVIG and developed a refractory convulsive state. CSF analysis showed elevated proteins and slight pleocytosis. Cerebral MRI showed non-specific white matter lesions and conventional angiography was normal. Chimerism on peripheral blood was 0% but was 45% donor on CSF. With the presence of chimerism on CSF, evidence of cutaneous and digestive GvHD and no infectious cause, neurological GvHD was considered the most likely diagnosis. Brain biopsy showed non specific change including neuropil spongiosis, microglial activation and reactive gliosis; but no signs of vasculitis or demyelinating disease. He was treated with ATG, high-dose systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, IVIG and intrathecal methotrexate and corticosteroids. CSF pleocytosis, proteins and chimerism improved with treatment (45% to 2% donor). No improvement was noted regarding his neurological state and he developed pancytopenia.

It must be taken into consideration in patients with neurological involvement after transplant, even solid organ transplantations.",

More recently, a rare CARD9 variant (c.1434+1 G>C, leading to exon 11 skipping, CARD9del11) showed a significant protective association towards inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) when present in heterozygosity. At the NIH we studied an 8-year-old male patient (P1) born to a non-consanguineous marriage who presented as an infant with recurrent/severe thrush, candida esophagitis, and an episode of tinea pedis; P1 also has mild hypogammaglobinemia (IgG ~500mg/dL at age 8y). P1s gDNA was tested by whole exome sequencing and showed a CARD9 c.1434+1 G>C mutation in homozygous state. Segregation analysis and Sanger confirmation determined that both parents and P1s elder brother carried the same variant in heterozygosity, while his asymptomatic younger brother (P2) was also homozygous. As previously described, this variant caused CARD9 exon 11 deletion as determined in P1 and P2s PBMCs by cDNA sequencing and by a lower molecular weight CARD9 protein by immunoblot evaluation. P1 and P2s PBMCs, as well as the heterozygous parents cells, showed a defective cytokine generation (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6 and GM-CSF) in response to heat killed candida (HKC), but not to LPS. While patients PBMCs failed to induce phospho-Erk and phospho-p-38 upon HKC-stimulation but presented an intact response to PMA+ionomycin; the parents cells responded normally to both stimuli. Moreover, T-cell activation and proliferation was affected in response to HKC but not to PHA in both patients, whereas the parents exhibited normal results under the same conditions. When HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with WT or CARD9del11 vectors together with a TRIM62 plasmid (E3-ubiquitin ligase, naturally associated to CARD9), we confirmed that CARD9del11 failed to bind TRIM62 by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, MALT1, BCL10 and TRIM62 were only co-precipitated by WT CARD9, but no by CARD9del11, strongly suggesting TRIM62 is an integral part of the CARD9/BCL10/MALT1 -CBM- complex.",

Our data also show that CARD9del11 acts in a dominant negative fashion in terms of cytokine generation (previously reported), but one WT allele seems sufficient to generate normal levels of HKC-induced p-Erk and p-P-38, as well as T-cell proliferation. While decreased cytokine generation associated with CARD9del11 in heterozygosity has been described to be sufficient to protect towards IBD, other defective pathways are affected in homozygosity and likely necessary to confer increased susceptibility to fungal infections. Altogether these results suggest that CARD9del11 acts through a gene dosage mechanism that can dissect pathways that associate IBD protection and fungal infection susceptibility. Further work is warranted to explore CARD9del11 role, if any, in B-cell and T-cell biology.",

This causes ectopic lipid deposition and deficiency of the adipokine leptin, which promotes metabolic dysfunction through impaired glucose handling resulting in insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and steatohepatitis. While the metabolic effects of altered adipokine secretion are known, the molecular mechanism is less clear. Many AGL cases are suspected to have an autoimmune etiology. Effector and regulatory T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages reside in normal adipose tissue. T cells within adipose tissue highly express PD-1 and regulatory T cells express CTLA4, which limits immune activation in the adipose tissue under normal circumstances. Thus, inhibition of these immune checkpoints may hypothetically cause immune activation, leading to adipocyte dysfunction and autoimmune destruction. We have encountered two cases that raise clinical concern for this process.",

She was otherwise healthy with no significant past medical history. Operative excision biopsy of the largest lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of RDD. Three months following diagnosis, routine bloodwork revealed that she had developed lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 1.4 x 109/L). Between 1-year and 2-and-a-half-years post-diagnosis, the patient was hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics for 2 presumed episodes of osteomyelitis and 2 presumed episodes of lymphadenitis. Given the recurrent presumed infections and persistent lymphopenia, the patient was referred to Immunology for evaluation. She received a full immunologic work-up. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping revealed low CD4 (288 cells/mm3) and low CD8 (228 cells/mm3) counts. The rest of her immunologic work-up was within normal limits. Approximately 3-and-a-half-years post-diagnosis, the decision was made to initiate treatment for RDD. She was started on a 6-week tapering course of prednisone therapy. Within 2-weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy, the lymphadenopathy had diminished, and by 6-weeks, the lymphopenia completely resolved. At her most recent clinic visit, she had been free of serious infections for more than 3-years, and her lymphocyte counts had remained stable and within normal limits for over one year.",

In this patient, the persistent lymphopenia and recurrent episodes of presumed infections appeared consistent with an immunodeficiency. Given the known association of RDD with immunologic dysfunction, this was certainly a reasonable assumption; however, when these issues resolved following corticosteroid therapy, we questioned whether her clinical presentation could instead represent a manifestation of her underlying RDD. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of differentiating between an infection and an RDD exacerbation. The episodes of presumed infections were considered probable but not confirmed with microbiologic or histopathologic specimens. The mechanism underlying lymphopenia in RDD is not clear but may involve decreased production, increased destruction, or sequestration of lymphocytes. To our knowledge, this has not been specifically studied in RDD in the past, however lymphopenia has been linked to lymphocyte maldistribution in other diseases. For example, studies have shown that experimentally altering either the surface of the lymphocyte or the environment through which the lymphocyte travels through can cause sequestration of lymphocytes in various lymphoid organs including lymph nodes.",

However, the time course and depth of diversity of T cell receptor rearrangements have been difficult to measure directly, necessitating estimates from total and na\u00efve T cell counts and from spectratyping, in which T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain diversity is estimated by the length distributions of cDNA amplicons between a series of TCR beta chain variable (V-beta) segments that have productively recombined with the TCR beta-chain constant region. Analysis of the actual sequences of rearranged TCRs could indicate more precisely the status of the T cell compartment of these patients, and might reveal oligoclonal expansion of dysregulated T cells, T cell insufficiency, or T cell exhaustion.",

Raw sequences were filtered to remove PCR errors, and resulting FASTQ files were converted into FASTA format (Seqtk software, GitHub, Inc), filtered for productive rearrangement, and analyzed for V, D, and J gene composition and length (IMGT HighV-QUEST software). The VDJ statistics file (PAST program) was used to calculate a Shannon entropy (H) index to measure repertoire diversity, taking into account both abundance and richness of the overall repertoire; and a Gini-Simpson index of unevenness, measuring inequality in the relative representation of species in a given sample.

In vitro studies have demonstrated reduced interferon gamma cytokine production, interference of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, and Th2 phenotype skew in T-cells with CARD11 defects. While homozygous mutation causes severe combined immunodeficiency deficiency, heterozygous CARD11 defect is associated with atopy by way of inappropriate Th2 skewing. Heterozygote atopy is characterized by eosinophilia, elevated IgE, and severe dermatitis. Despite multiple studies demonstrating in vivo consequences of CARD11 on T-cell function, little is known of the clinical significance.

The clinical course and treatment depends on whether the CARD11 variant causes gain- or loss-of-function. However, lymphocyte immunophenotyping and proliferation assays in cells expressing CARD11 variants don't easily distinguish between gain- and loss-of-function. To address this challenge in variant interpretation, we used multiplexed genome editing in a lymphoma B cell line (TMD8) to generate cell populations expressing all possible single-nucleotide variants in the N-terminal 140 amino acids of CARD11. To assess function in each variant, we tracked its relative abundance over multiple conditions using DNA sequencing. Since CARD11 is required for survival of TMD8 lymphoma B-cells, cells expressing clinically identified gain-of-function variants grew faster relative to cells expressing other variants, even in the presence of upstream pathway inhibitors. Upon evaluation of the relative abundance of each variant in genomic DNA and mRNA, we found that clinically identified loss-of-function variants were depleted in mRNA, which could be attributed to alterations in splicing or to nonsense-mediated decay. To address the impact of splicing, we modeled a newly-identified splice donor mutation (c.358+1G>A) found in two patients from one family diagnosed with combined immune deficiency, autoimmunity and atopy that was also observed in our screen. We show that the variant causes deletion of exon four and that CARD11 missing exon four exerts a dominant-negative effect leading to decreased NF-kB signaling and cell growth. These experiments demonstrate the utility of multiplexed functional assays for determining variant effect in clinically-relevant genes, which will improve diagnosis and treatment in patients.",

This rare primary immunodeficiency presents with dysmorphisms, severe neurological complications, hypogammaglobulinemia and a unique characteristic of decreased susceptibility to enveloped viral infections. Objective: to investigate the role of impaired host N-linked glycosylation on viral susceptibility to Ebola virus. Methods: To mimic the condition observed on CDG-IIb patients, we tested in vitro three proprietary iminosugars (EmergentBioSolutions\u00a9), UV4B, UV001, and UV00128, which act as competitive inhibitors of -glucosidase I and II. Their ability to inhibit the trimming of N-glycans was compared to known N-glycans modifiers as castanospermine, tunicamycin, as well as the bacterial enzyme peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F). Ebola virus envelope protein GP1 was chosen as a prototype glycoprotein, as it is heavily glycosylated with 15 N-glycosylation sites. HEK 293T cells were seeded at 1x10^5 cells/well in 12 well plate. After 18h, cells were transfected with pFlag-Ebolavirus GP1 by coupling with Effectene\u00ae. After 24h, cells were treated with the inhibitors and harvested 24h after treatment. Trimming of N-glycans was evaluated via molecular weight assessment by western-blot. Results: All three inhibitors had comparable effectiveness in inhibiting trimming of N-glycans from Ebola GP1 glycoprotein compared to castanospermine. A greater molecular weight shift was seen with tunicamycin and PNGase F as expected. Conclusions: Chemical inhibition of the N-linked glycosylation pathway was successfully achieved using three new MOGS inhibitors. This approach merits further investigation on potential applications on antiviral therapies.",

The persistence of H2AX at 24 hours post-irradiation and impaired phosphorylation of ATM and SMC1 at 1 hour post-irradiation demonstrates defects in DNA DSB repair, and this is variably altered in different lymphocyte subsets. Correlation between ATM phosphorylation in lymphocytes with outcomes may be an area for future studies and particularly important in counseling patients regarding outcomes.",

Over the following year the patient thrived gaining 7.5kg with normal every other day stools. Despite weight gain, he remained stable on the same dose of ruxolitinib. As he outgrew his dose, he developed an increased frequency of upper respiratory infections (Parainfluenza, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus). One year after initiation of ruxolitinib, he again developed profuse watery diarrhea that was Norovirus positive (weight 36kg, BSA 0.9). He was placed on bowel rest and ruxolitinib was dose escalated with a goal of 15mg/m2/day. When he reached 15mg twice daily, enteropathy completely resolved but liver function tests began to rise.

Allogeneic HSCT is the only curative option for XLP-1. Due to the underlying predisposition for EBV infection, rituximab has been used pre and post-HSCT (for EBV reactivation and immune cytopenia) in this disorder. We have observed a high incidence of poor B-cell immune reconstitution post-HSCT needing long-term immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement in this disorder. The biology of persistent post-rituximab hypogammaglobulinemia despite complete donor chimerism, the absence of GVHD and discontinuation of immunosuppression is poorly understood.

Six of the 13 (46.2%) surviving patients remain dependent on Ig replacement despite robust donor chimerism of 99-100% and no active GVHD. All but two received rituximab pre-HSCT. Of the patients who are independent of Ig replacement, only one (14.2%) received rituximab post-HSCT, whereas 5/6 of the Ig dependent patients received rituximab post-HSCT. T cell immune profiling revealed that the absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets, CD4+ na\u00efve T cells, and CD4+ recent thymic emigrants were not statistically different between Ig independent and dependent patients (Figure 1). However, there was a marked decrease in the number of total B cells, the percentage of memory B cells (CD27+ B cells), and class-switched memory B cells (CD27+ IgD- IgM- cells) in Ig dependent patients (Figure 1). T follicular helper (Tfh) cell populations (CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5+PD1+) were evaluated in four patients and the frequency was similar to healthy controls (4.5+/-1.2 vs. 3.9+/-1.4%). The ability of the patients na\u00efve B cells to class-switch was assessed following exposure to IL-21, anti-CD40 antibody, and anti-human IgM, and revealed normal B cell class-switching and differentiation to plasmablasts (Figure 1). Additionally, T cell ability to provide B cell help was assessed by co-incubating na\u00efve B cells with activated CD4+ T cells.

The application of MS/MS mainly focuses on the quantification of accumulated small metabolites in plasma resulting from various metabolic defects. However, many disorders do not yield such metabolic markers and would benefit from the direct quantification of intracellular target proteins. Unfortunately, the extremely low (e.g., pmol/L range) protein concentrations in blood cells limit their detection via MS/MS. In recent years, peptide immunoaffinity enrichment coupled to selected reaction monitoring (immuno-SRM) has emerged as a promising technique for the quantification of low abundance proteins in complex matrices, including dried blood spots (DBS). Our lab has demonstrated that immuno-SRM methods are able to reliably distinguish affected patients from the normal controls for Wilson disease (WD), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) (J. Proteome Res., 2017 and Front. Immunol., in press).

Preliminary data shows immuno-SRM methods are able to reliably quantify target proteins using signature peptides and accurately distinguish affected patients from normal controls. Analysis of signature peptides found statistically significant reduction or absence of peptide levels in affected patients compared to control groups in each case (WAS and BTK: p = 0.0001, SCID: p = 0.05). Intra and inter-assay precision ranged from 11 - 22% and 11 - 43%, respectively, and the multiplexed assay showed a broad linear range (1.39 2000 fmol peptide). In a blinded sample set of 42 PIDD patients and 40 normal controls, immuno-SRM-predicted diagnoses showed excellent agreement with clinical or genetic diagnoses. Every molecularly-confirmed case of WAS and BTK was also diagnosed by immuno-SRM analysis. In addition, 62 randomly selected samples provided by the NBS laboratory of Washington State were tested and peptide concentrations were found to be within normal ranges. Efforts are underway to validate and incorporate peptide biomarkers for Adenosine Deaminase deficiency, DOCK8 deficiency, and Ataxia Telangiectasia, as well as general markers for NK cells and platelets into a single multiplexed assay. In addition, SCID, WAS and XLA samples continue to be run while we focus on reducing assay costs, time, and necessary sample input. Our data herein provides proof of concept for the immuno-SRM workflow to be extended to various other genetic diseases as potential multiplexed newborn screening methods.",

Decreased lymphocyte/thymic output, as well as increased apoptotic T-cell death underlies lymphopenia in ECS/chronic GCs-exposed patients. Under such conditions, IL-21 was significantly decreased in plasma and our in-vitro studies showed that IL-21 replenishment was able to increase BCL2 (anti-apoptotic molecule) and BCL6 expression, and efficiently counteract the apoptotic effects of GCs. Recombinant IL-21 has been explored as a co-adjuvant treatment for multiple human cancers and may offer a treatment option for lymphopenia and its complications in patients with ECS/ chronic GCs exposure. Further studies are warranted to evaluate this therapeutic option.",

            "text": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major endocytic pathway by which eukaryotic cells internalize cell-surface cargo proteins and extracellular molecules, thereby allowing for a broad range of biological processes, including cell signaling, nutrient and growth factor uptake, and cell fate and differentiation1. The FBAR domain only proteins 1 and 2 (FCHO1/FCHO2) are involved in the initiation of clathrin coat pit formation. Whether FCHO1 and FCHO2 are functionally redundant or have distinct functions is unclear. We report here the first cases of a severe immunodeficiency due to a genetic defect affecting CME. By using whole exome sequencing and genomic analysis of a targeted PID gene panel, we have identified biallelic loss-of-function FCHO1 mutations in five patients from unrelated families of Italian (P1), Turkish (P2, P3, and P5) and Algerian (P4) origin with severe T cell lymphopenia manifesting as recurrent and severe infections of bacterial, mycobacterial, viral and fungal origin. P3 developed EBV-associated diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Three patients (P3-P5) died in childhood, whereas P1 and P2 are alive with full donor chimerism at 13 and 1.5 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, respectively and have cleared pre-transplant infections. Patients P2, P3, and P4 carried homozygous frameshift mutations predicted to cause premature termination. Western-blotting analysis of HA- or FLAG-tagged FCHO1 constructs showed expression of truncated products in P2 and P3, whereas no protein was detected in P4, presumably due to mRNA decay. P1 and P5 carried homozygous splice-site mutations at the invariant -1 and +1 positions, respectively, leading to skipping of exon 6 in P1's FCHO1 cDNA. qPCR analysis demonstrated differential expression of the FCHO1 and FCHO2 genes, with the former being predominantly expressed in lymphoid cells, whereas FCHO2 was more abundantly expressed in fibroblasts and K562 cells.",

While TCR internalization in response to CD3 cross-linking was normal (consistent with recent evidence that TCR internalization occurs through a clathrin-independent pathway), chase experiments demonstrated that transferrin internalization was abolished in activated T cells from P2. We had previously reported that a missense mutation in TFRC, encoding transferrin receptor 1, impairs transferrin internalization and intracellular iron delivery, causing a combined immunodeficiency with defective T cell proliferation.",
