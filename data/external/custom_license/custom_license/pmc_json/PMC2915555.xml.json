            "text": "Breast cancer remains the most common form of cancer to affect women.1 While cancer itself is a life-threatening disease, treatments for cancer can produce very unpleasant complications and side effects, including fatigue, anxiety, menopausal symptoms, nausea, lymphedema, and dermatitis. Such complications result in poor psychological adjustment, vitality status and quality of life.2 Mounting evidence indicates that herbal therapy is effective in alleviating anxiety, lessening cancer treatment-related side-effects, and facilitating rehabilitation.2\u20134 The mushrooms yunzhi (Coriolus versicolor) and danshen (Salviae miltiorrhiza) are two commonly-used herbs for cancer prevention.5 The results of clinical trials have further shown that the addition of yunzhi to radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients could greatly improve their clinical symptoms and stabilize their immune function, thus greatly improving their quality of life.5\u20138 However, methodological flaws in these studies, including a small sample size, have limited the generalizability of their findings. Evidence for the effects of danshen (Salviae miltiorrhizae) on cancer patients is less substantial. In 1996, a preclinical study showed that danshen had an antioxidative effect which could promote the immune system indirectly so as to facilitate rehabilitation and improve the quality of life in patients with cancer.9,10 Using danshen as a supplement may further promote the immunomodulatory activities of yunzhi.",

To be included in the study, the patients had to be Chinese females aged \u226530, stage I\u2013III breast cancer according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors by the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Grouping designated by the AJCC,14 and who were not receiving any concurrent medical treatment. Patients were excluded if they had cancer in both breasts or cancer metastases were present, had abnormal liver and renal function, were either pregnant or breastfeeding, had a significant history of drug hypersensitivity, or were taking other alternative medicine or supplements. Based on previous studies, there is a 7%\u201310% difference in the quality of life between women with and without breast cancer.15,16 Taking a conservative approach, an 11% increase in the quality of life was used as the primary outcome. Eighty-two patients were required in order to detect group differences at a 5% two-sided significance level with a power of 90% and an attrition rate of 20%.",

All subjects were asked whether they had experienced any discomfort or adverse events, by means of an open-ended question at each study visit. Particular instances of discomfort or adverse events were then sorted into 3 categories: \u2018Hot Constitution\u2019 for complaints such as cold sore or sore throat; \u2018Cold Constitution\u2019 for dizziness or diarrhea; and \u2018Others\u2019 for vomiting or stomach discomfort. This classification was suggested by a Chinese medicine practitioner and based on established terminology used in Chinese medical literature.18 Blood tests were carried out to assess renal and liver function and to ensure that the YZDS treatment was not endangering patients\u2019 safety. Serious adverse events were recorded in the serious adverse events form and reported within 24 hours to the Ethics Committee.",

The findings support the therapeutic effect of a combined treatment of YZDS on quality of life and vitality status. Rising stress levels make it very difficult for cancer patients to care for themselves, thereby causing many psychological and physical problems and placing a burden on health care costs. Yet the evidence suggests that a significant reduction in and management of disease- and treatment-related symptoms could improve the quality of life among women with breast cancer.16 Therefore, herbal therapy has a potentially-important role to play in managing psychological distress in cancer patients. This study also suggests that this herbal therapy is clinically acceptable and can be used safely with breast cancer patients.",

In this respect, the low power of the current study in detecting the intervention effect should be taken into account. Herbal therapy is becoming an increasingly-popular treatment method, and it is possible that its effect on the quality of life of some patients was exaggerated because they placed high confidence in its effectiveness.

It was originally designed as a double-blind placebo-control cross-over study, but it proved very difficult to persuade participants at risk from a life-threatening disease to observe the conditions of the study. The use of a placebo was a particular stumbling block. As nearly all the participants were afraid of a recurrence of cancer, 97% of them breached the terms of the study by taking their own herbal supplements, and over half (60%) were found to be taking 2 or more types of health supplement at the same time. The scale of this subversive behavior became apparent 4 months after the commencement of the study. We decided that the best and most practical course of action was to convert the study into a self-control comparative study without placebo, to ensure that the participants would comply with the study protocol. After we modified the study design, 97% of the participants promised to stop taking their own herbal supplements during a 1-month washout period and restart the 6-month clinical trial. Although such an open-label outcome study is obviously of lower research value by modern medicine standards and is not a substitute for the double-blind placebo methodology, it fulfilled an important role in defining the variables in the clinical use of Chinese medicine. Another limitation is the lack of information on the menstruation status of participants which might be important adjusted factors in exploring the relationship between the herbal effect and the quality of life among breast cancer patients receiving Tamoxifen. It should be taken into consideration in any future studies.",
