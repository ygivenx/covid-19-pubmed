Briefly, the middle lobe was perfused, lavaged, and then instilled with elastase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. The lung was minced, and the cells were isolated by filtration and partially purified by centrifugation on a discontinuous density gradient made of Optiprep (Accurate Chemical Scientific, Westbury, NY) with densities of 1.080 and 1.040 and by positive selection with MACS MicroBeads human CD326 (epithelial cell adhesion molecules) (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The isolated cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM glutamine, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin G (GIBCO, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD), and 10 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Cells were plated on 12-well cell culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY) that had been previously coated with rat-tail collagen (RTC) (in house) in DMEM with 10% FBS. The culture medium was changed to DMEM with 5% FBS on day 2 and to DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA on day 3. On day 4, the cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml rhHGF, 10 ng/ml rhTGF-\u03b1, or IAV, Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) strain (a gift from Dr. K. Hartshorn, Boston University, Boston, MA) (multiplicity of infection, MOI = 0.5), and cell lysates and culture medium were harvested at 24 h after each stimulation. To evaluate the effect of the TGF-\u03b1/EGFR pathway on IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion by AECs, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) (a vehicle control for AG1478) or 2.5 \u03bcM AG1478, an EGFR inhibitor (BioVision, Milpitas, CA) was added. These AEC culture conditions were used for most experiments, and the resulting phenotype of the AECs would be type I-like cells (48). However, additional studies were performed with culture conditions designed to maintain the type II cell phenotype. These cells were isolated by the IgG adherence method to remove macrophages and cultured on a mixture of RTC and Matrigel (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) in the presence of 1% charcoal-stripped FBS, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), 8 Bromo-cyclic AMP, and dexamethasone (33).",

The culture medium was changed to DMEM with 5% FBS on day 2 and to DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA on day 3. FBs were isolated from the same deidentified donor lungs as ATII cells described above. Human lung FBs were prepared by explanting minced human lungs into 100-mm tissue culture dishes. The medium consisted of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B, and 10 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin. After \u223c3 days, FBs grew out from the edge of the explants, the medium and remaining explant tissue fragments were removed, and the adherent cells were grown to 50% confluence. The FBs were then passaged, grown to near confluence, and frozen. These frozen cells were expanded once and then were used for all experiments (passage 2). We confirmed FBs with immunostaining of vimentin (+), thy 1 (CD90) (+), and cytokeratin (\u2212). FBs were plated on 12-well plates (0.25 million/cm2) (BD Bioscience) in DMEM including 10% FBS and cultured at 37\u00b0C in 10% CO2 for 2 days. The cells were then washed and cultured for another day in DMEM without serum. The following day, AECs plated on 12-well inserts were infected by PR8, and 1 h after inoculation an insert with AECs was placed over a well of a 12-well plate with FBs. Both the apical (0.2 ml DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA) and basal (1 ml DMEM with 1 mg/ml BSA) culture medium were harvested and combined at 48 h after infection.

Therefore, we examined whether IAV infection induced TGF-\u03b1 secretion and altered IFN-\u03bb and IP-10 secretion by human AECs. Human AECs were infected by PR8 (MOI = 0.5), and TGF-\u03b1 concentration in the medium was measured by ELISA. As shown Fig. 3, PR8 infection induced TGF-\u03b1 secretion by human AECs at 24 h after infection (n = 5) (Fig. 3A) and phosphorylation of EGFR (Y1086) at 30 and 60 min after infection (n = 3) (Fig. 3B). IL-8 secretion was induced by PR8 infection, which was inhibited by AG1478, an EGFR inhibitor (Fig. 3C). However, there was no alteration in influenza-induced IFN-\u03bb and IP-10 secretion by AG1478 (Fig. 3D). As basal levels of IL-29 and CXCL10 were below level of detection in our ELISA, we could not detect the changes in the basal levels of IL-29 and CXCL10 by rhTGF-\u03b1, and rhTGF-\u03b1 also did not alter IFN-\u03bb and IP-10 secretion by influenza-infected AECs (data not shown). In addition, GM-CSF secretion by PR8 infection was also evaluated because, from the results of Milliplex, we knew that GM-CSF secretion by AECs was also stimulated by rhTGF-\u03b1 (Fig. 1A). GM-CSF secretion was also stimulated by PR8 infection at 24 h after infection, which was inhibited by AG1478 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the baseline IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by AECs was inhibited by AG1478 (Fig. 3C).",

To determine which eicosanoids were stimulated by PR8 infection in AECs, arachidonate metabolites in the CM were analyzed by MS (Fig. 5B). PR8 infection induced PGE2 and TXB2 secretion by AECs (n = 3) (Fig. 5B). Finally, to determine whether PGE2 and/or TXB2 stimulated HGF secretion by lung FBs, PGE2 and TXB2 were added to lung FBs, and the culture medium was harvested at 48 h.

Influenza virus infection of bronchial epithelial cells has been reported to shed EGFR ligands including TGF-\u03b1 and activate EGFR, which in turn induces IL-8 (18, 45). Our study is the first to demonstrate that rhTGF-\u03b1 induces IL-8 secretion by human AECs (Fig. 1A) and that influenza virus infection induces TGF-\u03b1 secretion and activates EGFR, which induces IL-8 and GM-CSF secretion by human AECs (Fig. 3, A\u2013C).",

            "text": "The HGF/c-Met pathway plays important roles in various injury and disease models with promoting cell survival, regeneration of tissue, and suppressing chronic inflammation and fibrosis (27). Recently, we have also shown that rhHGF and HGF secreted by lung FBs enhance wound closure in human AEC monolayers (14). Although the HGF/c-Met pathway is well recognized for its role in regeneration of AECs in humans, little is known about HGF/c-Met signaling in the innate immune response during respiratory infections including influenza infection. As far as we know, there are three reports to link c-Met signaling with IL-8 or neutrophil migration. c-Met inhibition results in reduced accumulation of neutrophils to the wound site in zebra fish (5); rhHGF stimulates the induction of CINC-1, a rat analog of IL-8, gene expression in hepatocytes (16); and c-Met signaling regulates IL-8 secretion by pancreatic cancer cell lines (11). Thus this study is the first to show that HGF/c-Met signaling regulates IL-8 and GM-CSF by human AECs, which attract neutrophils, and that influenza virus infection to AECs activates PGE2/HGF/c-Met pathway, which induces IL-8 secretion. As c-Met ligand, HGF, is strongly expressed by lung FBs but not by human AECs (Fig. 2), we examined the effect of HGF/c-Met signaling on IL-8 secretion by AECs during influenza infection using a coculture system of AECs with FBs. A previous study reported that HGF was increased in the BALF of patients with ARDS and that HGF secretion by FBs was induced by PGE2 (34). These results are similar to our IL-8 induction pathway with AECs and lung FBs during influenza infection. AECs infected with influenza secreted PGE2, and exogenous PGE2 stimulated secretion of HGF by human lung FBs. We also tested stable TXB2 but not the biologically active unstable precursor TXA2. Therefore, the IL-8 induction by HGF in our coculture system might be observed in influenza viral pneumonia in vivo.",

Our study is the first to demonstrate that rhHGF, rhTGF-\u03b1, and influenza virus infection induces GM-CSF secretion by human AECs through c-Met and EGFR activation. However, GM-CSF has also been reported to be induced by EGFR activation in trophoblast cells (7), keratinocytes (24), and bronchial epithelial cells (35). Another growth factor, KGF, also enhances GM-CSF secretion by murine ATII cells, and KGF enhances alveolar host defense through GM-CSF-stimulated macrophage activation in a murine bacterial pneumonia model (52). Additionally, GM-CSF is produced by murine primary ATII cells through Toll-like receptor 4 signaling, which plays a protective role on lung epithelium during Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia (40). In terms of HGF, human monocytes stimulated by rhHGF have also been shown to induce GM-CSF mRNA levels (8). These studies support our findings. In terms of roles of GM-CSF, GM-CSF simulates migration, activation, and survival of neutrophils in the sites of inflammation (19, 20, 36), whereas, in the peripheral lung, GM-CSF regulates terminal differentiation of AMs, which is critical for pulmonary surfactant homeostasis and AM-mediated innate host defense (38, 44, 50). GM-CSF is also known to protect against IAV infection and postinfluenza bacterial pneumonia by activating AMs (13, 37, 41). In addition, in the BALF of patients with ARDS, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-8 are all increased in the patients compared with healthy controls, but levels of G-CSF and IL-8, but not GM-CSF, correlate with severity of pulmonary neutrophilia in ARDS (1). Therefore, although GM-CSF induces neutrophil migration, other functions of GM-CSF may be more important during influenza viral pneumonia.",

However, our results are different from those reported for bronchial epithelial cells; IP-10 and IFN-\u03bb secretion by human AECs is not altered by EGFR activation (Fig. 3D). In addition, although other EGFR ligands, AREG, and HB-EGF stimulate IL-8 secretion by bronchial epithelial cells (26, 30, 35) and AREG and HB-EGF are highly expressed by human AECs, in our studies, we found that AREG and HB-EGF do not induce IL-8 secretion by human AECs.

            "text": "The main and fatal complication of influenza virus infection is viral pneumonia, which can lead to ARDS. Influenza virus targets AECs, especially ATII cells, which are the first cells that influenza virus encounters after entering the alveolus. In response to viral infection, AECs produce cytokines and attract neutrophils (22, 39, 49). A key feature of ARDS is the accumulation of neutrophils in the lung, and the release of chemokines, including IL-8, from resident cells is central to neutrophil recruitment (51). Therefore, targeting EGFR and/or c-Met to suppress excessive neutrophil accumulation and subsequent inflammation may be a potential strategy for influenza virus-induced ARDS. However, there are several critical issues and limitations. First, neutrophils play an important role in innate immune defense by phagocytosing pathogens and preventing further invasion, whereas the excessive accumulation of activated neutrophils can cause unwanted bystander tissue damage. For example, removal of neutrophils in a model of influenza virus infection worsened outcomes (43). Second, c-Met and EGFR regulate multiple functional pathways such as regeneration of the damaged airway epithelium (9, 14, 28, 29, 32) and GM-CSF secretion, which might protect against influenza-induced ARDS (13, 37). For example, the EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, inhibits basal wound closure in human bronchial epithelial cells (32), and anti-HGF antibody added to mouse lung explants after influenza infection reduces alveolar epithelial regeneration (28). Therefore, in considering targeting EGFR and c-Met to suppress the excessive neutrophil accumulation and the subsequent inflammation, the potential benefits must be considered in relation to potential deleterious effects. Third, we have not investigated the relative importance of c-Met and EGFR signaling in vivo in the innate immune response to influenza virus infection and in the pathogenesis of ARDS. In a murine influenza model, EGFR inhibition protects mice from influenza infection with a decrease in infectivity by increasing leukocyte migration and IFN-\u03bb and IP-10 secretion (18). Influenza-infected mice treated with an EGFR inhibitor have decreased levels of murine IL-8 homolog, MIP-2, and neutrophils in the lungs. The relative importance of c-Met signaling in vivo on neutrophil accumulation in influenza-infected mice has not been investigated. Determining the role of HGF in the mouse during influenza infection is, however, more complicated because murine alveolar macrophages express and secrete HGF, whereas human alveolar macrophages do not (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, recombinant HGF stimulates alveolar proliferation and alveolar repair in the mouse during influenza infection and protects against alveolar damage (28, 29).",

            "text": "An unexpected finding was that EGFR inhibition was less effective at reducing influenza-induced IL-8 secretion in AECs cultured to maintain the alveolar type II cell phenotype. We assume that this is because additional parallel pathways were activated in the cells that maintain the type II cell phenotype such that significant inhibition of IL-8 secretion would require inhibition of multiple pathways. However, it is also possible that TGF-\u03b1/EGFR signaling is more effective when AECs are flattened and spread. Perhaps this pathway is more dominant in type I cells and in type II cells. Resolving these issues will require isolating human type I cells and additional studies in the future. However, it also indicates that studies with bronchial epithelial cells should include studies with highly differentiated cells to compare to cells cultured on tissue culture plastic.",

In the future, determining the signaling pathways downstream of c-Met and EGFR responsible for cytokine/chemokine production and epithelial repair in in vivo influenza models might provide insight into potential therapeutic targets to control excessive neutrophil accumulation without dampening host defense during influenza viral pneumonia.",
