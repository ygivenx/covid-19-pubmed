Within the Coronaviridae family (order Nidovirales) four genera are recognized: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. The six HCoVs (Table 1) currently identified belong to the genera alphacoronavirus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1). Gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses have no known viruses that infect humans, but contain important agricultural pathogens of livestock. Epizootic coronaviruses in animals cause a wide range of disease signs resulting from respiratory, enteric, and neurological tissue tropism. Although HCoVs cause primarily respiratory symptoms, the potential for a wide range of severe disease symptoms in humans caused by infection by future emergent coronaviruses cannot be excluded. Despite the severity and diversity of coronavirus disease signs and symptoms affecting a large number of important livestock species as well as humans, there are no proven therapies that specifically target CoVs.\n\n",

Bat coronavirus (BatCoV) sequences recovered from sampling sites on different continents (Asia, Europe, Africa, North America) over the last decade contain putative BatCoVs from diverse branches of the betacoronavirus and alphacoronavirus phylogenetic tree [9\u201312]. Importantly, the two coronaviruses that cause the most severe disease in humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, emerged from BatCoVs that were not previously recognized to infect humans or animals other than bats [12\u201314]. Recent studies suggest that BatCoV-SHC014 and BatCoV-WIV1 are genetically similar to SARS-CoV and enter cells using human receptors [10,15,16]. Similarly, BatCoV-HKU4 and BatCoV-HKU5 are MERS-like BatCoVs that may also be circulating in bat populations, and some MERS-like BatCoVs may also be able to recognize human host cell receptors [17\u201319]. Such BatCoVs are now called \u2018pre-emergent\u2019, because they may have the potential to emerge into human populations. Importantly, therapeutics that rely on host memory responses to target CoV infection are often not effective against pre-emergent BatCoVs that differ antigenically from known HCoVs, highlighting the need for pan-coronavirus therapeutics that target conserved mechanisms utilized by HCoVs and BatCoVs [15].",

Evolution of SARS-CoV evidenced by genomic sequence differences between zoonotic SARS-CoV strains infecting civets and epidemic SARS-CoV isolates likely resulted from viral adaptation, which is thought to be required for emergent CoVs to become transmissible from person-to-person [22,23].

            "text": "Research on coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has focused primarily on highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV due to the major potential consequences of pandemics resulting from these pathogens. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not transmit as efficiently from person-to-person compared to other respiratory pathogens like seasonal influenza, but mortality in patients of SARS (approximately 10%) and MERS (approximately 35%) greatly exceeded typical seasonal influenza case-fatality rates (2.4 deaths per 100,000 cases) [24]. Air travel facilitated these CoVs in seeding outbreaks in regions distant from initial localized viral spread: SARS-CoV emerged in the Guangdong province of southeastern China in late 2002, and then spread rapidly to other parts of the world, with outbreaks in major cities including Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto, resulting in one of the first pandemics of the twenty-first century [5]. Since MERS-CoV emerged in 2012, MERS cases have been exported from the Middle East to Europe, North America, Africa, and South East Asia, including a major outbreak of 186 people in the Republic of Korea in 2015 [25]. Superspreaders (individuals that transmit SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV to a large number of people) played an important role in initiating and perpetuating CoV outbreaks: the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea started from a single traveler case, and just five cases were responsible for more than 80% of the transmission events [25]. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted by close contact, with known outbreaks occurring in hotels, apartment buildings, and hospitals or health-care centers. Health-care workers, in particular, were at risk for infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at high rates [5,26]. In addition, animal workers were more likely to come into contact with CoV infected animals, and a large percentage of MERS patients had contact with intermediate host camels [26,27]. Analysis of severe SARS or MERS disease identified disproportionately high case-fatality rates in elderly patients (age > 65 years) and patients with pre-existing comorbidities including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and renal disease [4,26,28]. Based on these epidemiological considerations, pan-coronavirus therapeutics are needed to i) protect populations with occupational risk for transmission of CoVs, ii) protect populations with susceptibility to severe disease from CoVs, iii) work in concert with public health measures like quarantine and contact tracing, and iv) be rapidly deployable to geographically distant regions from local HCoV epidemics.",

Reverse genetics systems synthetically generate viruses from known viral sequences [29]. In situations where clinical isolates of infectious material are unavailable due to restriction for collecting patient samples, shipping infectious materials, or availability of containment laboratories, reverse genetics systems provide essential research materials for studies on viral pathogenesis and model development. Prior to the SARS pandemic, robust reverse genetics systems to manipulate the genomes of CoVs had already been developed by systematic assembly of cDNA cassettes into full-length infectious clones, allowing precise and targeted genetic manipulation of viral genes [30,31]. Infectious clones allow the creation of near-homogenous viral stocks, whereas traditional viral stocks are prepared by amplification of infectious material in cell culture over many passages. Strategies to build reverse genetics systems were rapidly applied to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV within the first year of identification of these viruses [32,33].",

As an example, the ability to isolate mutations in particular genes was applied to studies of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, while maintaining the isogenic background of the viral replicase and other structural proteins. Mutations from zoonotic, early, middle, and late epidemic strains of the SARS-CoV outbreak were inserted into the S glycoprotein of the epidemic strain of SARS-CoV (Urbani) to determine the effect of evolution on viral entry into human cells as well as viral pathogenesis in rodent and primate models of disease [34\u201336]. By targeting mutations to a specific viral gene, reverse genetics systems allow researchers to probe cause-and-effect relationships of host pathogenic responses to viral genetic changes. In addition, reverse genetics techniques were utilized to study pre-emergent BatCoV strains: recombinant versions of BatCoV-HKU3, BatCoV-WIV1, and BatCoV-SHC014 (SARS-CoV-like), as well as BatCoV-HKU5 (MERS-CoV-like) viruses, were generated and used for in vitro and in vivo models of emerging coronavirus disease [15,16,37,38]. Panels of zoonotic, epidemic, and pre-emergent viruses synthesized by reverse genetics techniques encompass a diverse array for use in high-throughput platforms for the discovery of countermeasures that are effective against the broadest range of CoVs without being reliant on procuring clinical isolates.",

            "text": "Like all other viruses, coronaviruses require host cell machinery to replicate their genomes, produce progeny virions, and cause disease. Cell lines require expression of the host cell receptor as well as expression of necessary proteases to facilitate viral entry, although additional host factors may also be important for infection. The S glycoprotein of coronaviruses, the main determinant of host cell attachment and viral entry, is not well conserved between HCoVs. Most human coronaviruses use different host cell receptors for viral entry, and may also require different host cell proteases that allow fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Table 1) [39]. Although all known HCoVs have viral tropism targeted at the human respiratory tract, lung cell lines infected by a broad range of HCoVs have not been defined. A key feature of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is that highly pathogenic coronaviruses grow to higher viral titer on a wider range of cell lines than the other mildly pathogenic coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 [40\u201344]. High throughput approaches to screen compound libraries for targeted activity against coronaviruses have been underdeveloped and limited in the number of viral strains used [45\u201352]. Infection of panels of cell lines from various animal species with HCoVs and BatCoVs informs on the potential host range of the pathogen, and may help to identify susceptible mammalian host involved in viral spread. However, productive infection of cell lines does not always translate to recapitulation of pathogenesis in the same animal model that the cell lines are derived from, which may be due to receptor availability in live animals or other biological and immunological factors during infection.",

Known as Human Airway Epithelia (HAE) or Normal Human Bronchial Epithelia (NHBE) cells, these cultures can be infected with all of the HCoVs identified thus far, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, providing a potential platform to screen novel CoVs for emergence into human populations [42,53\u201356]. However, several limitations are associated with HAEs including difficulty in collection due to the scarcity of donors and difficulty in maintenance because of limited capacity for cell divisions. HAEs may be sourced from donors with a preexisting disease state, which could influence viral pathogenesis. In addition, because of the genetic variability of donors, HAEs cultures often differ in expression levels of genes crucial to infectivity, including the various host receptors for HCoVs, which leads to high variability in the infectivity of these cultures. Importantly, these in vitro methods fail to capture more complex viral interactions that occur with an intact immune system including infiltration of proinflammatory cells that may promote and contribute to ARDS in the most severe forms of SARS and MERS. Organ-on-a-chip models in development may provide the next generation of in vitro models that could capture these critical interactions between respiratory cells and immune cells, but infection of these novel culture systems has not been reported with coronaviruses [57].",

SARS-CoV replicated in laboratory strains of mice, but did not cause disease signs, and virus was rapidly cleared from the lung in these models [60]. Serial passage of SARS-CoV in the lungs of mice by multiple research groups resulted in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains that caused lethal lung disease in wild-type mouse intranasal (IN) infection models [64,65]. Mouse-adapted SARS-CoV MA15 is the best characterized small animal model of CoV infection, and has been used to test several pan-coronavirus drug candidates [66,67]. The benefit of mouse-adapted models of SARS-CoV in wild-type inbred mouse strains includes reproducible susceptibility to disease assayed by survival, weight loss, and whole body plethysmography of individual mice as well as quantification of infiltrating cells, viral titers, histopathology, and transcriptomics and proteomics changes in target organs. To evaluate pathogenesis of emergent viruses in vivo, zoonotic SARS-CoV and pre-emergent BatCoV mutations have been incorporated into the SARS-CoV MA15 backbone, providing novel animal models for viruses that have the potential to emerge into humans [15,35]. Additional valuable avenues of research on variables known to impact severe CoV disease in the MA15 models of SARS-CoV include age, dose, and host genetic contributions to disease phenotypes [68,69]. The greatest limitations of SARS-CoV mouse-adapted models for drug discovery are the incorporation of mutations in the SARS-CoV genome (particularly for testing antiviral drugs that target viral genes with mutations) and acknowledged differences between mouse and human immune responses.\n\n",

MERS-CoV infection of rabbits resulted in viral replication in the upper respiratory tract, but no clinical disease signs that reflect more severe MERS-CoV disease symptoms were reported, although the model has been used for limited testing of MERS-CoV antiviral therapeutics [73,74]. However, due to the utility of the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model, a mouse model continued to be pursued, and adenovirus-vectored transient expression of the human DPP4 receptor in mice and subsequent replication of MERS-CoV in these mice determined that MERS-CoV replication was dependent on human DPP4 expression in rodents [75]. Transgenic expression of human DPP4 in mice allowed MERS-CoV replication in mice, but resulted in lethal brain disease not representative of MERS-CoV infection in humans [76,77]. Replacing mouse DPP4 with the expression of human DPP4 in mice resulted in a humanized DPP4 mouse model that allows MERS-CoV replication within the lung and some MERS-associated lung pathology, but no lethal disease [78]. Similarly, knock-in expression of the human DPP4 exons 10\u201312 in mice allowed viral replication but no overt MERS disease signs [79]. Serial passage of MERS-CoV in the lungs of these mice resulted in a MERS-MA virus that caused lethal disease in mice, including weight loss and severe lung pathology [79]. Identification of amino acids in mouse DPP4 that prevent entry of MERS-CoV into mouse cells led to the rational design of the mouse DPP4 gene edited by CRISPR/Cas9 to express two human DPP4 mutations (288/330 DPP4) [80]. 288/330 DPP4 mice supported viral replication without severe disease or lethality, but serial passage of MERS-CoV (generating a mouse-adapted virus called MERS-15) produced lethal disease in the 288/330 DPP4 mice [80]. Although many of the same metrics of disease to MA15-SARS-CoV are available in the MERS-15 or MERS-MA models for drug discovery of coronavirus antivirals, an additional drawback is the requirement for both mouse-adapted virus and a modified rodent host. Despite these limitations, mouse models of adapted SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are currently the best-developed models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection available for pan-coronavirus drug discovery.\n\n",

Disease signs are observed in NHP models of infection without adaptation of CoVs required in rodent models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Commonly reported disease signs included lethargy and increased respiratory rates following SARS-CoV infection in multiple NHP models of infection, but other acute signs of illness including fever or dyspnea were infrequently reported. The most severe disease phenotypes were observed in the histopathology of the lungs at acute times post-infection (3\u20136 days) with typical findings of pulmonary lesions and pneumonitis and occasional observations of diffuse alveolar damage [86]. Although none of the NHP species that were infected with SARS-CoV developed lethal respiratory disease reflective of SARS patients, NHP models did recapitulate enhanced disease in aged NHPs, including aberrant innate immune signaling programs [87].

However, infecting rhesus macaques or common marmosets by multiple concurrent routes (IN, IT, oral, and ocular) resulted in moderate disease in rhesus macaques, but more severe disease in marmosets [88,90]. Infecting NHPs by multiple routes likely caused a systemic infection potentially not representative of human MERS-CoV infection. Although the marmoset is currently the best developed NHP model of MERS-CoV disease, discrepancies in disease severity of marmosets infected by multiple routes and marmosets infected by the IT route illuminate potential difficulties with using this model for drug development studies. Small size and fragility of marmosets precluded serial blood draws on multiple days following infection, and may confound experimental outcomes resulting from MERS-CoV infection or treatment [92].

Efficacy of GS-5734 in post-exposure treatment of Ebola virus-infected nonhuman primates led to GS-5734 inclusion in an experimental therapy for an infant survivor of Ebola virus disease [45,95]. These encouraging results demonstrated that GS-5734 may be an acceptable therapeutic intervention to lethal viral disease, even days after viral exposure, and tolerated by patients with viral diseases that were previously treated primarily with supportive care. Based on activity against MERS-CoV within a larger panel targeting lethal viruses from multiple viral families, additional studies demonstrated that GS-5734 decreased viral titers and viral RNA in in vitro models of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection of HAEs [66]. Additionally, GS-5734 had similar effects against other diverse CoVs including HCoV-NL63 and Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV, betacoronavirus group 2a) [66,96].

Although viral resistance to GS-5734 was shown experimentally in vitro, mutations to conserved motifs in SARS-CoV and MHV resulted in decreased viral fitness in vitro and in vivo [96].

In vitro and in vivo approaches by multiple groups identified mAbs targeting either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV that inhibited viral replication and ameliorated SARS and MERS disease in animal models [74,78,89,113]. As an example, antibodies generated against the S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV inhibited viral replication when administered 24 h prior to infection, as well as 24 h postinfection in a humanized DPP4 mouse model [78]. In general, mAbs that were effective against CoV infection in animal models targeted the highly variable S glycoprotein, but these mAbs lack cross-protection against other related CoVs [114]. Monoclonal antibodies developed against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or other emerging CoVs may require separate formulations for each virus due to differences in the targeted antigen. For example, mAbs targeted against S from 2003 SARS-CoV isolates failed to neutralize closely related BatCoV-SHC014 and only some mAbs neutralized BatCoV-WIV1 [15,16]. In general, mAbs target specific epitopes, and viruses avoid neutralization by accruing mutations in the targeted epitope that allow viral escape from mAb therapy. Pre-clinical and clinical mAb formulations may include a cocktail of multiple mAbs that target different epitopes to ensure that viruses cannot escape neutralization. However, SARS-CoV S tolerated mutations in multiple epitopes allowing escape from neutralization from multiple mAbs, and the introduction of mAb escape mutations enhanced pathogenesis of the virus in some animal models [115]. In sum, efficacious monoclonal antibody therapy against highly pathogenic coronaviruses may require several mAbs targeting conserved epitopes and rigorous testing is required to demonstrate that viral evasion of mAbs does not result in enhanced virulence.",

Zoonotic pathogens like coronaviruses emerge from animal reservoir species, thus vaccination strategies are unlikely to lead to eradication while the virus continues to circulate in reservoir hosts. One Health approaches to solving the problems of emerging infectious diseases consider the environment and animal health, as well as human health [116]. For example, vaccination strategies targeting the camel intermediate host of MERS-CoV have been developed, which may work to repress viral replication in camels, preventing MERS-CoV transmission to humans [117].",

Vaccine formulations that have been developed against SARS-CoV not only fail to protect animal models of aged populations, but also result in immunopathology in younger populations, where SARS disease is enhanced in vaccinated groups that are subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [118,119]. In addition, vaccines generate memory immune responses to specific pathogens, and no vaccine formulations have been developed that are effective against multiple CoVs. Due to the diversity of BatCoVs, it seems unlikely that current therapeutic strategies targeting specific SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV antigens will be efficacious against future coronaviruses that emerge into the human population. Vaccines formulated against the SARS-CoV epidemic antigens do not offer effective protection against SARS-like BatCoVs that are currently circulating in bat populations [15]. Rather, a modular vaccine platform that can be rapidly adjusted for newly emergent viral antigens in potentially pandemic CoVs may be able to provide emergency vaccine coverage against emergent viral strains.",

However, targeting conserved host mechanisms utilized by multiple coronavirus as an essential part of the viral life cycle is an approach to pan-coronavirus drug development where viral escape by mutation is less likely. Several groups have attempted to inhibit host proteases (including furin, cathepsins, and TMPRSS2) that process viral S glycoproteins at the cell surface during viral entry [50,120\u2013122]. However, due to variation in viral S glycoproteins among different CoVs and variation in the host proteases required for viral entry (Table 1), combinations of protease inhibitors would be required for pan-coronavirus treatment regimens, particularly for emergent novel CoVs where host protease requirements have not been evaluated. Additional host targets with less established mechanisms of activity include Cyclosporins, a class of cyclophilin inhibitors with antiviral activity against coronaviruses in addition to immunosuppressive properties [123]. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporins like alisporivir retained antiviral properties in vitro against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, but were not effective against SARS-CoV in mouse models of infection [124].",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are a class of immunomodulatory compounds produced by host cells in response to detection of pathogen-specific motifs, resulting in IFN secretion that affects not only the stimulated cell, but also neighboring cells. Early in infection, IFN stimulation results in altered cellular transcriptional programs, leading to an antiviral state characterized by the activation of a large set of host genes with partially defined antiviral functions [125]. Based on these potentially beneficial immunomodulatory properties in the context of infections, IFNs have been used for the treatment of emerging viral infections where no specific antiviral drugs yet exist, with the greatest benefits resulting from administration very early following infection. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, Type I IFNs were effective at decreasing viral replication in vitro and showed additional benefits in in vivo primate models of infection [103,104,107,126,127]. IFNs used in the treatment of SARS and MERS patients often occurred in combinatory therapies with other drugs including ribavirin and lopinavir-ritonavir, although potential beneficial effects of therapies were limited, potentially due to administration at later times postinfection [108]. Upstream stimulants of IFN induction, including polyI:C resulted in IFN signaling cascade activation, with demonstrated effectivity in vitro and in vivo against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [67,75]. Additional immunomodulatory compounds that regulate the expression of innate immune genes have been suggested as potential therapeutics for highly pathogenic coronaviruses; however, compounds that modulate the host response require significant testing in the most rigorous animal models before therapeutic applications could be pursued. For example, corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) were given as treatment during the SARS and MERS epidemics due to immunomodulatory effects that suppress inflammatory responses with no perceived benefit and possible deleterious effects [108,109].",

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were contained by diligent enforcement of public health measures that limited viral spread to approximately 10,000 cases total for both SARS and MERS since 2003. However, the threat of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or an as-yet unknown BatCoV that causes severe disease in humans makes antiviral therapeutics that broadly target coronaviruses a highly desirable commodity to ensure global public health.

A key finding from our review of the literature is that current animal models for highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adequate to support advanced development of antiviral therapeutics. MERS-CoV continues to circulate on the Arabian Peninsula, providing the opportunity to investigate some treatments of MERS in clinical trials. However, future emerging coronaviruses may require use of the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule for Investigational New Drugs (INDs). INDs must fulfill the Animal Efficacy Rule criteria of i) reasonable safety for initial use in humans, ii) pharmacological data that support reasonably well-understood mechanism of activity against the pathogen, and iii) efficacy in animal models with disease signs representative of clinical illness in humans (including one non-rodent model). While the vigorous pursuit of small animal models has been successful in generating rodent models that recapitulate severe SARS and MERS disease signs (including morbidity and mortality), progress in generating additional animal models has lagged, particularly in primate models of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection. Past strategies for experimental treatment regimens primarily relied on combination therapies with approved drugs known to have acceptable safety profiles and broad-spectrum antiviral activity including IFNs, ribavirin, and corticosteroids. However, analyses of data returned from these treatments indicated that most regimens were not effective in treating SARS and MERS patients.

Currently, Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources) is a source for a limited number of strains of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63. Laboratory strains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E are available through the American Type Culture Collection, but strains of HCoV-HKU1 are not available through either resource.

Reverse genetics approaches have generated pre-emergent BatCoVs from sequence, especially those related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These particularly novel avenues of research have identified that BatCoV strains with similar pathogenic profiles to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV continue to circulate within bat populations, indicating a continued vulnerability to highly pathogenic coronavirus emergence.

Currently, public health measures have been adequate to stymie the spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV primarily due to disease surveillance coupled with viruses with limited person-to-person transmission. However, biological factors that increase cross-species transmission or facilitate person-to-person spread may lead to future coronavirus strains not capable of being contained by timely quarantine of infected individuals. Any increase in highly pathogenic CoV virulence, pathogenesis, or transmission would likely require a targeted medical countermeasure.
