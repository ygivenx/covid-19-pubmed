Recombinant cyanovirin expressed in soybean seeds is shown to be biologically active in anti-HIV assays [4]. The cyanobacterial lectin microvirin, originally isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806, which shares 33% similarity with the cyanovirin, is unusual in that it potently inhibits HIV-1 with negligible toxicity compared to cyanovirin [3, 5]. A third cyanobacterial lectin with broad biotechnological potential given its biological activity is scytovirin, a lectin that was isolated from the cyanobacterium Scytonema varium [6]. Cyanobacterial lectin scytovirin has 95 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 9.7 kDa divided into two structural domains (SD), the first spanning amino acids 1\u201348 (SD1) and the second 49\u201395 (SD2). These are nearly identical, although they present different affinities and may bind independently to ligand carbohydrates [7]. Since scytovirin can bind to HIV glycoproteins gp160, gp120 and gp41 and to the Zaire Ebola virus mucin domain and shows antiviral activity against these viruses [8, 9], it is currently being investigated as a potential antiviral microbicide candidate.",

Because such a mannose content is uncommon in mammalian cells, these compounds are not likely to be toxic to human cells in vivo [10, 11]. However, it has been demonstrated that HIV can develop resistance to HIV by deglycosylation in site-specific residues, although multiple mutations are necessary to make this happen [12]. Therefore, it is very important to know all the structural aspects of the interaction of scytovirin with the high-mannose arrays in order to develop an effective microbicide.",

The radius of the search area covered all key residues described as ligation sites [8]. Docking results were further refined by energy minimization and Hbonds to optimize hydrogen bonds after docking. Each docking had 10 runs, population size of 100 and max iterations of 2000.

AMBER 12 package was used to perform all steps of preparation and MD [16]. Carbohydrate parameters were obtained from the GLYCAM06 [17] force field. For the protein and ions, FF99SB [18] and GAFF [19] force fields were used, respectively. Next, we set up three systems: (i) Man4 bound to both domains (SD1 + SD2) using the full-length protein; (ii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein, containing only SD1, (iii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein containing only SD2. The three systems were constructed, each one with a ligand (Man4), Cl\u2212 ions to neutralize the charges and the TIP3P water molecules in a cubic box with 12 \u00c5 in each direction of the protein. Sander software, which is included in AMBER 12, performed the energy minimization in five stages. The first four stages used 3000 cycles of steepest descent and 5000 cycles of conjugate gradients. In the remaining stage, 5000 cycles of steepest descent and 30,000 cycles of conjugate gradients were used. The heavy atoms had their movement restrained by a harmonic potential of 1000 Kcal/mol \u00c52, while in the final step all atoms were free. For heating and equilibration, 14 steps were used. A harmonic potential of 25 Kcal/mol \u00c52 was employed to restrain the heavy atoms in the initial stages. In the step 13, the restraining force was set to 0. The temperature was gradually increased, until it reached 300 K. Langevin dynamics (thermostat) were employed with a collision frequency of 3.0 ps\u22121. This method is significantly more efficient at equilibrating the system temperature than the Berendsen temperature coupling scheme that was recommended for older versions of AMBER [16]. The heating procedure lasted 650 ps until step 13 and was performed using an NVT ensemble. Afterwards, a 2 ns equilibration phase was employed in an NPT ensemble. The SHAKE algorithm was employed to restrict the vibration of the ligations of all hydrogen atoms. The Particle Mesh Ewald method was used for calculating electrostatic interactions using a cutoff value of 10.0 \u00c5. Thus, 210 ns MD was produced in an NVT ensemble, for each system. The cpptraj module was used to compute the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of both trajectories, considering the heavy atoms of the main chain. 5000 snapshots from the last 10 ns of the MD simulations were used to calculate the free energies using MM-GBSA, MM-PBSA and SIE methods [20\u201322].",

The behavior of the protein and the ligand was different in each analysis. The most stable system was the full-length scytovirin complexed with Man4, which shows RMSD values around 1 \u00c5 for protein and 3 \u00c5 for Man4 (Fig. 1). The system based on SD1 and Man4 complex presented a higher number of conformation changes in comparison to the other systems, but the SD1 became more stable at the end of the simulation. Nonetheless, Man4 remained complexed with the protein during all MD simulations. It was also observed that during the entire simulation with the full-length scytovirin, Man4 maintained interactions with residues of SD1 and SD2 simultaneously (Fig. 2).",

In the three methods used here, the SD1 showed the best values of binding free energy. When the energy decomposition was performed, it was possible to observe that different residues are involved with Man4 binding. Additionally, scytovirin presented several residues contributing along full-length protein (Fig. 3), including the regions with aromatic residues like Trp8 and Phe47. We can observe that the most important residues of SD1 binding (Glu10, Ans18 and Arg30) are conserved in SD2 as Glu58, Ans66 and Arg78, but they do not contribute to interaction when SD2 is complexed individually with Man4 (Fig. 3; Table 2).",
