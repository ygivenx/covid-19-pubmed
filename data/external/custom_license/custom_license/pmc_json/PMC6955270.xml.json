In the poultry industry, infection of chicken flocks with IBV causes economic losses by reducing egg quantity and quality. In addition, animals become more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections like Escherichia coli (1). The severity of disease and organs affected depend primarily on the IBV strain (2). Phylogenetic classification of IBV strains results in 32 phylogenetic lineages (GI-1 to GI-27 and GII to GVI) (3), of which GI-1 includes historically the first IBV genotype identified, Massachusetts (IBV-Mass). IBV-Mass infections are reported worldwide, and in Europe, GI-1 is currently the 3rd most prevalent genotype (2). The more prevalent IBV genotype circulating in Europe is IBV-QX (GI-19) (2, 3), which has been reported to cause kidney disease in contrast to IBV-Mass (2).",

            "text": "Binding to host tissues is the first step in the viral life cycle of IBV and therefore a critical factor in determining tissue tropism. Tissue tropism differs based on the amino acid composition of the spike protein as shown by recombinantly produced proteins (15\u201317) and infection assays with recombinant viruses (18). The spike of IBV is posttranslationally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, where S2 is anchored in the virus membrane and important for membrane fusion. S1 comprises the head domain of spike and is responsible for host receptor binding (19). Using recombinantly expressed M41-S1 proteins, alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids were identified as the IBV receptor on a glycan array, where specific binding to the ligand Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc was observed (19). Recently the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the M41 spike has been resolved (20), indicating that the S1 subunit consists of two independent folding domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) (amino acids 21 to 237) and C-terminal domain (CTD) (amino acids 269 to 414), with a proposed receptor-binding site in both domains. Experimental evidence using recombinantly expressed spike domains has indicated that amino acids 19 to 272 of the M41 spike are sufficient for binding to trachea as well as binding to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (15). This domain thus contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and can be used to study the biological implications of genetic variation in circulating IBV genotypes.",

To verify that no additional sites are present in M41 that could bind to kidney or trachea tissue, we produced recombinant proteins consisting of the full ectodomain (ED), the S1 portion of the ED, the RBD (NTD of S1), and the CTD of S1. Each protein was assessed for binding using trachea and kidney tissue slides. Binding to trachea tissue was observed using M41-ED, S1, and RBD but not CTD to ciliated epithelium of the trachea, specifically located at the base of the cilia (Fig. 1), confirming previous observations (15, 19, 21). None of the proteins bound kidney tissue, which is shown by a representative picture using M41-RBD (Fig. 1B). Binding affinity to the known ligand (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was observed using M41-RBD, M41-S1, and M41-ED, not significantly different when compared to each other but significantly higher compared to those of M41-CTD and turkey coronavirus (TCoV)-S1 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that ligand binding of M41-RBD is not significantly different compared to that of M41-S1 and M41-ED, suggesting no additional ligand-binding motifs are present in S1 and ED; thus, in the remaining experiments, we used M41-RBD, as the tissue tropism of the virus is reflected using this recombinant protein.",

These regions include the previously described hypervariable regions (HVRs) (highlighted in gray) of M41-S1 (22). Before studying whether sequence diversity between the RBDs of M41 and QX contributes to the reported broader tropism of QX in vivo, we first determined if the potential RBD of QX behaved like that of M41 (Fig. 1) and that it contains a receptor-binding domain (15). Both proteins were produced as soluble recombinant protein in mammalian cells and analyzed on Western blots after purification. Before loading, a fraction was pretreated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to remove posttranslational glycosylation. QX- and M41-RBD migrated comparably at around 55 kDa (including glycosylation) and had a backbone of around 32 kDa as expected after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2B). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to assess similarities in secondary structure between M41- and QX-RBD. Spectra at all temperatures followed the same curve, and both proteins had similar broad melting curves, indicating that both proteins are equally stable (data not shown). Subsequent secondary structure calculations using DichroWeb (23) presented that M41- and QX-RBD contain 29 and 25% \u03b1-helix, 16 and 17% \u03b2-strands, and 55 and 58% random structures, respectively (Fig. 2C). Finally, we confirmed that the QX-RBD was biologically active by applying it to chicken trachea tissue slides in protein histochemistry. We observed clear binding to the ciliated lining of epithelial cells and structures present in the kidney (Fig. 2D), indicating that QX-RBD, like M41-RBD, contains a receptor-binding site.",

To this end, we allowed both proteins to bind to tissue microarray slides containing 28 different chicken tissues (24). Binding of M41-RBD was primarily found on the ciliated lining of the epithelium of the proximal and distal trachea (Fig. 1), but additional staining was observed in the epithelial lining of the colon, cecal tonsil, ureter, oviduct, and conjunctiva (Table 1). QX-RBD bound to the same tissues as M41-RBD, but additional binding was observed in gizzard, ileum, and cloaca of the digestive tract, as well as liver and kidneys (Table 1 and Fig. 2D), reflecting that observed in vivo for replication of both genotypes. Detailed analysis of staining present in the kidney showed that binding of QX-RBD was restricted to the parietal epithelium of Bowman\u2019s capsule in the glomerulus (Fig. 2D). No binding to the glomeruli was observed when using M41-RBD in three independent experiments using different protein batches. Taken together, QX-RBD shows a markedly broader binding profile than that of M41-RBD, which is in line with the reported broader tissue tropism in vivo (2).",

As expected, binding of M41-RBD to the trachea was completely prevented (Fig. 3A, middle column) in the presence of the synthetic M41 ligand. In contrast, QX-RBD still showed strong binding to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea and glomeruli of the kidney. To confirm the loss of binding of QX-RBD to Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc, a solid-phase ELISA was performed, in which Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc was coated. As expected, no binding of QX-RBD to this particular glycan was observed at any of the protein concentrations, which is comparable to that of the negative control TCoV-S1 (only binding longer branched galactose-terminated glycans [25]), while M41-RBD bound to Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B).",

Chimeric RBD proteins were generated by dividing each wild-type RBD into three domains and mixing them to get six different combinations (schematic representations in Fig. 4A). These chimeras were then applied to trachea and kidney tissue slides. Chimeric proteins containing amino acids 98 to 156 (middle domain) of M41 (M-M-Q, Q-M-M, and Q-M-Q) demonstrated reduced binding to trachea and no detectable binding to kidney tissue (Fig. 4B). In contrast, chimeric proteins containing this region of QX (Q-Q-M, M-Q-Q, and M-Q-M) had comparable binding to tissues as QX-RBD. In particular, strong binding to the ciliated epithelial lining of trachea and specific staining in Bowman\u2019s capsule in the glomerulus was observed (Fig. 4B). Like wild-type RBDs, binding of all chimeric proteins was dependent on the presence of sialic acids, as pretreatment of host tissues with AUNA abrogated binding (data not shown). M-M-Q, Q-M-M, and Q-M-Q proteins had reduced affinity for Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc (Fig. 4C), potentially explaining the reduced staining of these proteins to trachea tissue (Fig. 4B). None of the RBD proteins containing the middle QX sequence (Q-Q-M, M-Q-Q, and M-Q-M) had affinity for this glycan in the ELISA as expected based on tissue staining (Fig. 4B and C), which is in line with the hypothesis these proteins are dependent on binding to the QX receptor instead of the known M41 receptor. These results indicate that the receptor-binding site responsible for recognition of the QX receptor is determined by amino acids 99 to 159 of the spike.",

In the ELISA, both M41-SGS and M41-KIP demonstrated a decreased affinity for alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids compared to that of M41-RBD, while introduction of both triplets SGS and KIP (M41-SGS-KIP) completely abolished binding to this glycan (Fig. 5C).

            "text": "Finally, we modelled QX-RBD based on a structural overlay with the recently resolved cryo-EM structure of the M41 spike (20) and focused on the amino acids allowing kidney binding. The overall structure of both proteins is comparable (Fig. 6A, green ribbon, M41; blue ribbon, QX); however, the loop consisting of HVR 2 is slightly larger in QX-RBD as expected, as there are two additional amino acids present (Fig. 6A, SGS100\u2013102 for QX-RBD versus Y99 in M41-RBD). Interestingly, this loop was predicted to be involved in sugar binding (20), which we showed to be true for QX-RBD but not for M41-RBD. In detail, the tyrosine (Y99) in the M41 structure (Fig. 6A, beige) occupies more space than serine (S in QX) and can be seen reaching toward a neighboring loop. Furthermore, the 110\u2013112KIP sequence identified in QX-RBD (Fig. 6A, dark blue) places a positive charge at the protein surface, which is not present in 107\u2013109MLQ in M41-RBD (Fig. 6A, light blue). Previous in silico docking analysis performed with potential alpha-2,3-linked ligands to the M41-RBD protein identified amino acids S87, N144, and T162 to potentially be involved in receptor binding (17). When we highlighted these amino acids predicted to be involved in binding to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 6B, red spheres) and the amino acid triplicates involved in binding to the QX-specific receptor (100 to 102 [SGS, yellow spheres] and 110 to 112 [KIP, dark blue spheres]) in the overlaid RBD ribbon structure, we demonstrate that binding of the different ligands recognized by M41 and QX are on different sides of the protein (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, when these amino acids were highlighted in the full cryo-EM resolved structures of M41 (Fig. 6C) and QX (Fig. 6D), it clearly shows that the potential ligand-binding site of M41 is at a different location compared to the QX ligand-binding site (Fig. 6C and D).",

Unfortunately, no binding was observed using our RBD proteins.

Sequence alignment of this amino acid triplicate (100 to 102 in QX-RBD) varies in nephropathogenic IBV genotypes from SGS/SGT for clade GI-19 (IBV-QX), NQQ/SQQ for clade GI-13 (IBV-793B), and SGA for clade GI-14 (IBV-B1648) at that position.

            "text": "Structural analysis of the RBD of IBV suggests that the receptor-binding sites for M41 and QX are positioned at different sides of the RBD (Fig. 6B through D). Previous in silico predictions of the interaction with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid ligands in M41-RBD pointed toward three amino acids, S87, N144, and T162, which are in close proximity to four essential N-glycosylation sites (N33, N59, N85, and N160) (17). Although the amino acid sequence of S87, N144, and T162 is conserved between M41 and QX, one of the essential N-glycosylation sites is at a different position (N59 in M41 and N58 in QX). This may result in a different conformation of the ligand-binding site, thereby preventing QX-RBD wild-type binding to the M41 ligand, which was supported by experimental evidence using the chimeric M41-RBD protein where this glycosylation site was replaced, resulting in loss of binding to trachea tissue (data not shown). Furthermore, in the publication where the cryo-EM structure of M41 was resolved, the loop consisting of amino acids present in HVR 2 of the spike was proposed to be required for receptor binding (20). Our data points toward involvement of the unglycosylated loop containing HVR 2 for recognition of the QX glycan ligand but not the M41 ligand. Furthermore, the cryo-EM structure of the M41-CTD predicts other putative receptor-binding motif loops in M41 spike (20). In Fig. 1, we demonstrated that no binding to trachea and kidney tissue was observed using our recombinantly expressed M41-CTD, in contrast to their published results. As binding of QX-RBD reflects the tissue tropism of QX-infected birds, we speculate whether these loops (in the CTD) are necessary for initial receptor recognition and are involved in QX infection.",

The codon-optimized sequence of QX-RBD (amino acids 19 to 275; GenBank accession number AFJ11176), containing upstream NheI and downstream PacI restriction sites, was obtained from GenScript and cloned into the pCD5 expression vector by restriction digestion as previously described (19). Fragments to generate chimeric RBD proteins were created by splice overlap extension PCR using the primers in Table 2 and cloned into the pJET vector (Thermo Scientific, USA). The sequences were verified by automated nucleotide sequencing (Macrogen, The Netherlands) before cloning each fragment into the pCD5 expression vector. Mutations up to 9 nucleotides (nt) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers listed in Table 2, and the sequences were subsequently verified by automated nucleotide sequencing (Macrogen, The Netherlands).",
