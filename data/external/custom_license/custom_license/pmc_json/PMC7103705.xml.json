            "text": "Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at risk of exposure to various pathogens through their daily tasks. They may serve as a reservoir for ongoing nosocomial transmission, particularly highly contagious infections such as varicella and measles [1]. Nosocomial transmission can result in infection of susceptible patients, outbreaks, work and patient care disruption, and increased cost [2,3]. An occupational exposure is defined as an exposure of HCP to a material containing an infectious agent in a healthcare setting [1]. The exposure can occur in inpatient settings (e.g. patient rooms and laboratories), in outpatient settings (e.g. medical offices and dialysis units), and in nontraditional facilities (e.g. emergency medical and skilled nursing facilities) [1]. HCP include all paid and unpaid persons working in healthcare settings who can potentially be exposed to patients and/or to infectious materials, including body substances (e.g. blood, tissue, and specific body fluids), contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air [1]. The infectious organism can be transmitted to HCP from a patient, another HCP, hospital visitor, or the environment by several routes (Table 1) [1].",

These include vaccination of HCP who are at risk of infection and are close to or in frequent contact with high-risk patients; education and implementation of infection prevention and control measures (Table 1); and timely delivery of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to susceptible HCP in the event of exposure [4,5]. PEP involves administration of anti-infective agents, vaccines, or immunoglobulin as soon as possible to HCP potentially exposed to a pathogen in order to reduce the risk of infection [1,4]. Management of HCP exposure to infectious agents is paramount not only to prevent or attenuate the infection in the HCP but also to prevent secondary transmission to their contacts [1].",

Infection control and occupational health departments should be notified for postexposure management of HCP, identification of all contacts of the index case, application of immediate infection control measures for the index case and exposed HCP, if indicated, and for deciding on whether exposed HCP can continue to provide patient care [1,4]. The HCP should be evaluated by an experienced clinician in the occupational health or emergency department as per institution policy. Postexposure management includes assessing the risk of transmission through a thorough history and laboratory testing, if necessary, with follow up, if indicated, timely administration of appropriate PEP, if available, and general and psychological counseling of exposed HCP [1,4]. The clinician can determine the need for PEP after exposure to an infectious agent based on the followings: infectivity of the source patient or material at the time of exposure, extent and type of exposure, susceptibility of the HCP to the infectious disease of concern, and whether the exposed HCP is at a greater risk of complications than the general population [1,4]. Vaccines should be given to the exposed HCP even if they present beyond the time indicated for PEP administration. All nonimmune HCP should be vaccinated against hepatitis B virus (HBV), seasonal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and varicella [4,5]. The HCP should be counseled on risk of infection acquisition and transmission to others, particularly if they decline PEP, benefits of treatment, importance of adherence to the drug regimen, possible adverse effects of the PEP regimen, and follow-up plan [1,4].",
