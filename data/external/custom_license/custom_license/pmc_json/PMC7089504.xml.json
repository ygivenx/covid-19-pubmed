Among the proteins encoded by these genes, S protein, a glycoprotein peplomer (surface antigen) on the viral surface, plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptor glycoproteins with subsequent penetration into the cells occurring via membrane fusion.

Similar to attenuated PEDV DR13, the Br1/87 S protein has 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a hydrophobic stretch at positions 1,322\u20131,337 [10]. Although CV777 was a little different, it did contain 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites [15]. Prediction of N-glycosylation sites using the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) Proteomics Server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) revealed that CV777 S protein contains 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines that are predicted to be N-glycosylated. The Br1/87 and parent PEDV DR13 S proteins are a little different but still have 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines that are predicted to be N-glycosylated. In the case of attenuated PEDV DR13, two (from N to K at 378, from T to I at 1,260) of the changes in the predicted amino acid sequence destroy N-linked glycosylation sites, while another change (from N to S at 114) creates a new glycosylation site when it compare to CV777 and Br1/87, respectively. There are two amino acid changes (from N to K at 378, from N to T at 1,193) destroying N-linked glycosylation sites and another change (from N to S at 114) creating a new glycosylation site when the attenuated PEDV DR13 is compared with parent PEDV DR13. Taken together, it appears that 2 nucleotide changes of 5 changes are thought to be simply strain differences because we reveal 1 nucleotide change (from A to C at 3,588) destroying N-linked glycosylation site through amino acid change (from N to T at 1,193) found in not other wild type PEDV but only parent PEDV DR13, and another change (from C to T, A in parent DR13 at 3,789) destroying N-linked glycosylation site through amino acid change (from T to I, N in parent DR13 at 1,260) found in both parent and attenuated PEDV DR13. Therefore, the fundamental cause of these differences in N-linked glycosylation sites was 3 nucleotide changes and these are suggested to influence the pathogenicity of attenuated PEDV DR13.",
