Drosten's fatigue, and his sudden celebrity, both stem from the fact that his team developed the first diagnostic test for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

And since the test was unveiled on 26 March it has been distributed to more than 150 labs around the world. All in all, it's a considerable achievement for such a small team, given the high-powered virology labs that were engaged in the same quest.",

The story began in early March, when Drosten and his team \u2014 research scientist Stefan G\u00fcnther and a handful of students \u2014 were reading daily Internet postings about a mysterious respiratory illness in Vietnam. \u201cThen, on 15 March, the WHO issued its global SARS alert, and two infected people, a doctor and his wife, landed at Frankfurt airport,\u201d Drosten recalls.",

Initial tests in Frankfurt and elsewhere drew a blank in the search for a viral culprit in sputum taken from the doctor. So when a second sample, taken on 17 March, was sent to the Hamburg institute to see if a tropical virus might be involved, it fell into Drosten's hands.",

He first fixated on the family of paramyxoviruses, whose members include the rare Hendra and Nipah viruses, which can jump from animals to people. \u201cFrankfurt colleagues had looked at the patient's sputum sample under the electron microscope, and the shape, like a squashed sphere, was reminiscent of a typical paramyxovirus,\u201d says Drosten.",

He couldn't quite believe it \u2014 particularly when Canadian researchers working on samples from patients in Toronto suggested that the causal agent was a metapneumovirus, a type of paramyxovirus. So Drosten sent his sample to Europe's leading paramyxovirus expert, Albert Osterhaus at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, who confirmed the negative diagnosis.",

This required a pure culture of the virus \u2014 the patient's sample would be too full of human genetic material to yield a clean result. Here, Drosten's connections to Frankfurt were crucial. He went to medical school in the city, and many of his former colleagues still work there. And on 20 March, while he was in Frankfurt preparing a presentation with one such colleague, Drosten learned that a culture set up at the university had just begun to yield the virus.",

The next day, he described them on the institute's website and offered to provide them for free. He also made available synthetic sequences that mimic the behaviour of the virus in the PCR test. These 'positive controls' are important, as negative PCR results can often mean simply that the procedure has failed. Although scientists in Hong Kong and at the CDC have since developed similar tests, they have not distributed them as widely, nor provided positive controls.",
