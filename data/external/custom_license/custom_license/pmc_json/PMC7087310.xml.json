The family Circoviridae is divided into two genera: Circovirus and Cyclovirus. Circoviruses have two main inversely arranged ORFs encoding the replicase protein and capsid protein, respectively [2, 3]. Circoviruses have been identified in a number of birds and other animals as well as humans. While some circoviruses cause subclinical infections, others can cause serious diseases with a serious economic impact [4], such as porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), which affects pigs all over the world [5]. Circoviruses have been confirmed to be associated with vesicular and hemorrhagic and enteric diseases as well as low body weight, poor body condition, and feathering disorders in birds [6, 7]. An immunosuppressive effect has been observed in infections with PCV2, psittacine beak and feather disease virus, pigeon circovirus, and duck circovirus [8, 9].",

Canine CV has been reported to be associated with vasculitis, hemorrhage, hemorrhagic enteritis, and diarrhea [10\u201313]. Canine CV DNA has also been discovered in mesenteric lymph nodes and ileal Peyer\u2019s patches in infected dogs [3, 10]. Furthermore, canine CV may act as a coinfection factor and play a role in the development of disease [14, 15]. In addition to dogs, canine CV has also been detected in wolves and badgers [16]. However, the pathogenicity of canine CV is still controversial. Moreover, little is known about the evolutionary dynamics and genetic variation of this virus. Recently, the prevalence and genetic variation of canine CV in Guangxi, Southwest China, have been reported, but the epidemiology of this virus in other regions of China is still unclear.",
