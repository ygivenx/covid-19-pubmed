However, self-reporting is unlikely in pre-verbal children, as well as in infants with altered consciousness [11]. Regardless of which tool is used to assess pain, perception of pain in pediatrics is complex, and entails physiological, behavioral, and developmental factors [12, 13], including the limitation of the experience of the examiner. In these instances, a cooperation-independent monitor for pain would be highly helpful [14]. The Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE, MDMS, Loos, France) is a valid non-invasive system in children up to 2 years of age based on the analysis of the respiratory fluctuations of heart rate that mainly reflect variability in the parasympathetic tone [15]. The NIPE monitor records the ECG signal continuously, enabling a quantitative assessment of the respiratory variability of heart rate, which decreases during nociceptive stimulation [16]. To date, only a few studies have focused on this technology in children, the majority of them in the area of anesthesia [17\u201319].",

The population chosen was infants with bronchiolitis admitted to PICU, with demographics similar to those described in previous studies [22]. The reason for choosing this disease, apart from its elevated incidence, was the frequent use in this group of treatments with potential discomfort, such as nebulizations [23]. In this paper, the results from a smaller previous study are corroborated, since it has been consistently found that nebulizations constitute a scource of discomfort for patients. The degree of this discomfort, as measured using clinical scales, is higher when using a JN system compared to a NHF system [20].",

In the present study, the NIPE appears to be a sensitive tool to detect changes during nebulization, as a variation was detected in the NIPE values of 9 points during nebulization. However, these changes were almost identical between one nebulization system and the other. These results contrast with the variations in comfort that the clinical CBS detected during nebulization, as well as the greater clinical discomfort of the JN nebulization system compared to the NHF [20]. If a score of less than 17 on the CBS scale, like that determined by Van Dijk et al., is taken as a cut-off point for the administration of analgesics [34], the number of patients with values below 17 during nebulization was significantly higher with JN than with NHF.",

Furthermore, there could be other explanations for these findings in our study. In the first place, an increase of 4 points was found in the HR compared to the baseline, there being a slight correlation with the change in the clinical CBS. This increase of barely 1% difference from the increase found in other studies supports changes in the HR of 10\u201325% as a good indicator of nociception [17, 36]. In pediatrics, and in pediatric anesthetics in particular, it is normal practice to monitor changes in HR from baseline as an indicator of pain and discomfort [37, 38]. As such, Migeon et al. showed that ANI measurements decreased after skin incision in children over 2 years of age anesthetized with sevoflurane. This could be used in combination, or as an alternative to HR monitoring [17]. Ledowski et al. observed similar results, concluding that ANI might provide a more sensitive assessment of nociception in anesthetized children than hemodynamic parameters or skin conductance [39]. However, the percentage rise in HR required to identify a painful stimulus in children is debatable, some studies not finding changes in the HR in painful procedures [40, 41], or even emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting heart rate as an index of comfort [42]. Secondly, we had to exclude a number of NIPE values with Quality \u20180\u2019 which meant not analyzing 18% of the nebulizations. However, the number of nebulizations rejected in each nebulization system was similar; thus this should not be the reason why we did not find any differences between the two nebulizers used.",

The non-integration of the monitor as a routine tool in our unit meant that the exact time of the evaluation of the scale will not be noted correctly in the monitor, obliging us to rule out this line of study, and focus instead on analysis of the difference of the values obtained during the entire period. In future research we aim to measure not only the magnitude of NIPE variation during nebulization, as was done in this present paper, but to investigate whether the direction of this change (increase or decrease) indeed correlates to the variations in comfort levels measured using clinical scales.",
