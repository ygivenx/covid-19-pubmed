            "text": "Since the early 1990s [1], nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) has provided an attractive alternative to PCR for the amplification of RNA (Fig. 1). It is routinely used in the clinical diagnosis of many single-stranded RNA viruses, including influenza A [2], foot-and-mouth virus [3, 4], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus [5, 6], West Nile virus [7], human bocavirus (HBoV) [8], and most importantly HIV [9, 10]. NASBA offers the potential for low-cost, portable diagnostic devices, because unlike PCR, NASBA is isothermal. Additionally, NASBA often runs faster than PCR, it compares favorably with regard to sensitivity and convenience [11], and it is preferred over PCR for clinical HIV samples [10, 12]. Because of advances in microfluidics, NASBA is poised to offer major advantages in sequence-based diagnosis.\n",

Hybridization sites on long, viral RNA strands require rigid oligonucleotide design, and only a small fraction of oligonucleotides hybridize efficiently to RNA [13], making many conserved regions unsuitable as NASBA priming sites. Even heating NASBA reagents to 65 \u00b0C before adding enzymes [14] and selecting primer sites 100\u2013200 nucleotides apart fail to prevent inhibitory secondary structures [15]. Most importantly, primer dimerization can significantly increase the rate of false positives, which is extremely dangerous in certain clinical tests.",

These non-specific, confounding hybridizations are considered non-inhibitory when their melting temperatures are well below the amplification reaction temperature (41 \u00b0C). In contrast, inhibitory dimer formations involve non-specific hybridizations characterized by T\nm values close, equal to, or exceeding the amplification reaction temperature. Of all of the possible dimer formations, the most likely to disturb normal reaction kinetics involves the primer containing the T7 promoter sequence, because this sequence is directly involved in the amplification process. The T7 promoter sequence, which must be incorporated into one of the primers, is inherently prone to forming dimers.",

Endpoint NASBA is usually accompanied by a gel electrophoresis, which determines the size of nucleotides and detects size-specific sequences. Real-time NASBA is often advantageous because it does not require gel electrophoresis: it uses molecular beacons or other forms of fluorophores for sequence detection. The use of fluorophores is conducive to inexpensive diagnostic devices utilizing optics, such as LEDs and photodiodes. However, due to the lack of nucleotide size detection, real-time NASBA is more susceptible to false positives.",

As the starting template, 1 nM of amplicon probe was used for each set in our experiments. These synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA), and their nucleotide sequences are available in the supplementary section. Each oligonucleotide set was analyzed to predict hybridization energies and potential dimer formations and illustrated using DI-nucleic acid hybridization and melting prediction (DINAMelt Server, RNA Institute, SUNY Albany, Albany, NY; available at http://mfold.rna.albany.edu) [18]. The reagents used for real-time NASBA and their concentrations at the final reaction volume (80 \u03bcL) were 40 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 12.5 mM MgCl2, 73.5 mM CH3COOK (KOAc), 5.25 mM dithiothreitol, 1.05 mM dNTP, 2.1 mM rNTP, 0.21 \u03bcM each primer, 52.5 nM molecular beacon, 15.75 % dimethyl sulfoxide, 1.68 U/\u03bcL T7 RNA polymerase, 0.34 U/\u03bcL AMV-RT, 0.005 \u03bc/\u03bcL RNase-H, and 0.11 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA). Samples were amplified in real-time for 90 min in BRAND disposable UV micro cuvettes (Wertheim, Germany) using a Photon Technology International QuantamasterTM spectrofluorometer (Birmingham, NJ, USA) maintained at 41 \u00b0C.

The primer 1 (P1) and probe \u0394G and T\nm values (highlighted grey) show that P1 has a very strong affinity to its intended target probe. P1 also forms a strong self-dimer (highlighted grey and bold), albeit nowhere near as strong as the P1-Probe hybridization. In the presence of large quantities of probe, the P1 dimer will remain non-inhibitory. However, as the concentration of probe decreases, the P1 dimer has a greater inhibitory effect. For negative controls (i.e., no probe), the P1 dimer will become completely dominant. The P1 dimer is capable of producing its own RNA product through NASBA amplification, because it contains a T7 promoter region (Table 2).\n",

This is achieved by manually manipulating individual bases in the sequence of P1 so that there are fewer potential adenine-thymine and guanine\u2013cytosine hydrogen bonds in the DINAmelt predicted hybridization. The required T7 promoter sequence gives primer 1 inherent minimum \u0394G and T\nm values that make it susceptible to dimerization. After manipulating the original P1 sequence used, we achieve \u0394G and T\nm values (Table 1) for the P1 dimer matching those of the abridged T7 promoter sequence dimer alone (\u0394G = \u22123.7, T\nm = 22.9 \u00b0C); thus, we have designed P1 such that dimerization is as unfavorable as theoretically possible. Although there is a slight decrease in \u0394G and T\nm for the P1-Probe hybridization, the potential for P1 inhibitory dimerization has been eliminated because the dimers dissociate far below the reaction temperature. Finally, in the H3 influenza set (Table 1), the P1-P1 dimer dissociates well below the reaction temperature, and P1-Probe hybridization is relatively strong and occurs well above the reaction temperature.",

In design (ii), there is no competition for binding sites. However, because the beacons are target-specific, one beacon design may only be used for one sequence-specific target. Both beacon system designs have their ideal applications. For example, design (i) is ideal for HIV-1 mutation detection: a large number of HIV-1 mutations impart drug resistance, so it is very important to screen for many mutations in parallel (multiplexing). Although design (i) can target all known mutations, a positive result does not indicate which mutation is present. Design (ii) is ideal for influenza virus sub-typing. This design yields sequence-specific results, indicating which types of influenza are present within a given sample, (H1N1, H3, H5, etc.), and it avoids premature transcription abortion by the T7 RNA polymerase, which has been observed in previous work [16].",

Poorly considered primers can not only decrease reaction kinetics, but can also increase the rate of false positives, which is dangerous in the context of clinical HIV testing, for example. Two approaches to primer design significantly improve reaction kinetics and test accuracy\u2014reducing the length of the T7 promoter sequence to the abridged version and reducing the potential number of adenine-thymine and guanine\u2013cytosine hydrogen bonds in the primer. Furthermore, effective primer design requires DINAMelt analysis of the bond strength not only between primers and probes, but also between potential dimers and the beacon. A safe approach to improve reaction kinetics is to redesign the probes to avoid dimers at 41 \u00b0C, because that is the optimal temperature of the reaction enzymes. Salt ion concentrations may also be altered but have significant implications for all hybridization energies and should not be altered if possible [20]. The application of the NASBA assay is an important design parameter to consider since we have shown that a real-time NASBA system capable of detecting a group of sequences is less efficient than a real-time NASBA system only detecting one target. Successful primer design is not simply a matter of improving the efficiency of NASBA-based clinical assays; it is crucial to their accuracy as well.",
