If this new subtype spreads globally causing disease and deaths, it becomes pandemic. Since the 16th century, influenza pandemics have occurred at intervals ranging between 10\u201350 years, creating varying levels of impact on societies. [1] In March 2009, a new subtype of influenza A H1N1 virus was identified in Mexico and the United States. It spread to all continents in less than nine weeks becoming the first pandemic of the 21st century. Children, young adults, pregnant women, and those with chronic illnesses were disproportionately affected and constituted the majority of the hospitalization cases. The estimated case fatality rate was 0.15\u20130.25%, with most deaths in middle-aged adults with underlying diseases. [2] Although concrete evidence on the macroeconomic consequences of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have not yet been revealed, previous studies estimated the potential reduction of labor productivity and consumption demand, with results showing an approximately 2\u20135% decrease in annual gross product.

[1], [2] These documents summarize the recommended WHO and national actions against pandemic influenza according to recognized pandemic phases. For some recommendations, evidence is limited to observations or epidemiological models. In some cases, inferences are drawn from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome. With a view to incorporating important experience and evidence acquired during the H1N1 2009 pandemic, the WHO will revise its pandemic preparedness guidelines. Including cost effectiveness evidence in the revision process will strengthen the guidance by providing a framework to prioritize the allocation of limited resources in impending, high risk times.",

Second, studies were assessed according to the quality of evidence used, since it is widely recognized that the credibility of economic evaluations depends not only on the appropriateness of the methods employed but also on the input evidence. Several types of evidence are evaluated according to their level of quality: i) clinical effect sizes; ii) adverse events and complications; iii) baseline clinical data; iv) resource use; v) costs; and vi) utilities (only applicable to cost utility analyses). The data sources of each component are ranked from one to six in descending order. Rank 1 is given if parameters are derived from the most appropriate data sources.

This study converted cost effectiveness ratios into a common currency and utility unit. Costs in international dollars (I$), at 2011 values, were calculated using national gross domestic product deflator values and implied purchasing power parity conversion rates from the International Monetary Fund (http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28). In addition, exchange rates obtained from the OANDA website (http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates) were applied when cost outcomes were reported in foreign currencies rather than in local equivalents. Because of the lack of explicit and implicit thresholds for most countries to determine which interventions are cost effective, the World Bank thresholds for classifying countries into low income, lower middle income, upper middle income, and high income countries according to 2010 Gross National Income (GNI) per capita were used as maximum ceiling thresholds. [8] In other words, the interventions that spent fewer resources than the upper bound of GNI per capita given by the World Bank in order to gain one QALY or save one DALY represent good value for money.",

More than half of this information was from non-analytic studies (e.g., case reports or case series), expert opinions, and unsourced information. A significant improvement was observed for economic evaluations conducted after the 2009 event. For these studies, a majority of baseline clinical data was obtained from case series or the analyses of reliable administrative databases from the setting of interest. Almost half of these studies employed resource use information from reliable administrative data sets from the setting of interest and also over half of the utilities were derived from direct or indirect utility assessment rather than from unknown sources or expert opinion. Nevertheless, there was not much difference in the quality of clinical effect size parameters between the before and after studies.

(Of course, the interventions that are cost effective for low income countries should also be cost effective for countries with higher incomes). Quarantine for household contacts seems unlikely to be cost effective even for low and middle income countries because the ICER is well above the maximum ceiling threshold for upper middle income countries. (However, this interpretation cannot apply to high income countries because it depends on their GNI per capita).
