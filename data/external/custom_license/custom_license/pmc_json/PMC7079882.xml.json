When viral components are detected by pattern recognition receptors, infected cells produce type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type III (\u03bb) IFNs (Randall and Goodbourn 2008). Binding of IFNs to their specific receptors leads to the induction of more than 300 IFN-stimulated genes, including myxovirus resistance A (MxA), also known as the myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1, IFN-inducible protein p78 (mouse) (MX1) gene. Following IFN-induced expression, MxA is thought to form oligomeric rings around the nucleocapsid structures of viruses, thereby inhibiting their transcriptional and replicative functions (Haller and Kochs 2011).",

            "text": "The promoter of the human MxA transcript in the original report contains two IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), ISRE1 and ISRE2, near the transcription start site, and both are involved in IFN responsiveness (Ronni et al. 1998). The IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex binds to the most proximal ISRE1 and the second ISRE2. ISRE1 is essential for MxA promoter activation, whereas ISRE2 has an enhancing effect in the presence of activated ISRE1 (Ronni et al. 1998). IFN regulatory factor 3 can only bind to ISRE2 for enhancing promoter activation (Holzinger et al. 2007). Around ISRE2, there are two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at nucleotide positions \u221288 and \u2212123, which confer differences in the promoter activity and binding affinity to nuclear proteins (Hijikata et al. 2001; Ching et al. 2010). Promoter SNPs of MxA are reportedly associated with diseases, including hepatitis C (Hijikata et al. 2000; Hijikata et al. 2001), hepatitis B (Peng et al. 2007), multiple sclerosis (Furuyama et al. 2006), and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Torisu et al. 2004). We previously reported the association of MxA promoter SNP with the severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; Hamano et al. 2005), and Ching et al. (2010) reported its association with susceptibility to SARS in a larger case\u2013control study. However, the expression levels of MxA have been analyzed only in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or liver cells (Fernandez-Arcas et al. 2004; Kong et al. 2007; Abe et al. 2011; McGilvray et al. 2012).",

In addition, a new transcript variant with alternative 5\u2032 untranslated exons starting 5.5 kb upstream of the original exon 1 has recently been registered in the public database (NM_001144925.1).

Primary cultured HBE cells were obtained from the cancer-free bronchi of surgically resected lungs after obtaining written informed consent from the individuals concerned, all of whom were Japanese. HBE cells (n = 38) were isolated and cultured as described previously (Gray et al. 1996) and used after three\u2013five passages in this study. In brief, HBE cells were seeded at a density of 5 \u00d7 105/well onto collagen-coated six-well Transwell plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) and cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA) for 24 h.

Most of the tissue RNA in this panel consisted of pooled RNA from two or more donors, and their genotypes were not available. One microgram of total RNA was subjected to RT with random nonamers using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). MxA mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and CFX96 (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). Sense and antisense primers were located in exons 0b and 0c (5\u2032-CCAGAGCAACT-CCACACCGGGTGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTATGGTTCCAATCCAGGTGATC-3\u2032) for the T0 transcript and exons 1 and 2 (5\u2032-GCACTGCGCAGGGACCG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGG-TGAGCAGGTGGGCGGCA-3\u2032) for the T1 transcript. PCR conditions consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and annealing and extension for 1 min at 60 \u00b0C. Specific target amplification was confirmed by a single peak in the dissociation curve. The mRNA copy numbers between different transcripts were compared using the absolute quantification method (Leong et al. 2007). RT-PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA), and their copy numbers were calculated from the DNA concentration determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The standard curve was generated with a serial fivefold dilution of each RT-PCR product, and the linear dependence of the threshold cycles was confirmed from the template concentrations. We used the \u03b2-actin gene (primers listed in Online Resource 1) to normalize the expression of MxA for calculating the relative amounts of mRNA of each transcript. The TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Hs00182073_m1) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) that amplifies exons 16\u201317 of MxA was used with TaqMan Universal Master Mix II (Applied Biosystems) in the StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), and the relative amount of total transcripts, indicating the overall expression of MxA, was calculated using the standard curve method with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control.",

When we evaluated the overall expression of the MxA transcripts by real-time RT-PCR, it was found to be closely correlated with levels of the T1 transcript, suggesting that individual variation of the total expression of MxA is mainly explained by the T1 transcript. Indeed overall levels of MxA as well as expression of the T1 transcript were strongly associated with these three SNPs at baseline levels. It has been repeatedly reported that the minor A allele of \u2212123 SNP and the minor T allele of \u221288 SNP, which are in strong LD, were associated with the overall transcriptional activity of the gene (Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004). Expression of MxA was associated with \u221288 G/T SNP when PBMC cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b12 for 12 h (Fernandez-Arcas et al. 2004). In one study (Furuyama et al. 2006), the results of a luciferase reporter assay suggested that \u2212123 SNP contributed to basal expression levels of MxA, whereas \u221288 SNP contributed to the induction of expression by IFNs. Ching et al. (2010) further showed that the \u2212123A allele had a stronger binding affinity to nuclear proteins from unstimulated cells and that the \u221288 T allele preferentially bound to the protein after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation. In our study using HBE cells, \u2212123, \u221288, and +20 SNPs were all associated with baseline expression of the T1 transcript, and according to a multiple regression analysis, among the three SNPs, +20 C/A SNP was still associated with baseline expression of the T1 transcript. This finding may be attributed to the difference in cell type; however, extensive investigation is required to determine the possible effect of +20 SNP or other unknown functional polymorphisms in strong LD. Recently, Tran Thi Duc et al. (2012) reported that three SNPs (\u2212309 C/G, \u2212101 G/A, and +20 C/A) also contributed to the promoter activity in combination with well-known effects of \u2212123 and \u221288 SNPs. We could not examine \u2212309 and \u2212101 SNPs in our samples because \u2212309 C/G and \u2212101 G/A SNPs were detected only in the African population and their minor allele frequencies were relatively low (Duc et al. 2012).",

When HBE cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b2 for 12 h, the same three SNPs were not associated with the expression level. These findings may conflict with the in vitro effects of these 5\u2032 SNPs on the IFN-inducible promoter activity previously assessed by a luciferase reporter system (Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004; Tran Thi Duc et al. 2012). In our study, however, the mRNA induced by poly(I:C), the dsRNA analog to mimic viral infection, was directly assessed in primary cultured HBE cells, which implies that individual variance of relevant factors such as toll-like receptor 3 and subsequent IFN signaling pathways might have affected the mRNA levels in the IFN-stimulated condition and have masked the independent effects of these promoter SNPs of the MxA gene.",

According to Chen and Subbarao (2007), IFN induction is completely suppressed in SARS coronavirus-infected cells. Our ex vivo findings that these regulatory SNPs were mainly involved in baseline expression of the T1 transcript support the results of these disease association studies. However, we could not show significant difference in the regulatory effects between \u221288 and \u2212123 SNPs, possibly because of strong LD between these two SNPs in the Japanese population (r\n2 = 0.83) compared with moderate LD in the Chinese population (r\n2 = 0.39) (Ching et al. 2010).",
