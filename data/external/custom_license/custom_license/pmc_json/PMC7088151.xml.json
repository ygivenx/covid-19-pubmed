In our experiments with an inoculation dose of 10\u20131 to 10\u20132 MOI, viral loads reached nearly normal levels 72 h post-inoculation (Fig. 4b,c), suggesting as low as 4% of ACE2 expression (Fig. 1) is sufficient to support entry of SARS-CoV particles adequate to produce equivalent viral loads at 72 h. The presence of some other cellular receptor(s) for SARS-CoV is another possible explanation for the failure in blocking SARS-CoV replication at higher inoculations.
