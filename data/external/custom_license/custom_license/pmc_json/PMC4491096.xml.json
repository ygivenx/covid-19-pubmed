With the literature on diagnoses, treatment and monitoring of shock updating frequently, it is important to have up-to-date guidelines. An important process to facilitate the establishment of national/local guidelines is the production of a consensus statement of scientific societies. Therefore the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine formed a taskforce to review literature and expert opinions on the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring in circulatory shock. Their report was a long expected update on the publication of the International Consensus Conference on hemodynamic monitoring in shock in 2007 [1]. The Taskforce produced 44 statements using the GRADE system principles [2] and included studies published up to October 1st 2014 [3]. Therefore this consensus statement published in December 2014 issue of Intensive Care Medicine represents a very up-to-date view on current evidence. The Taskforce recommends NOT using currently recommended preload parameters as a sole target of fluid resuscitation or targeting any ventricular filling pressure or volume. The Taskforce recommends to fluid resuscitate patients using more than one single hemodynamic variable and to use dynamic instead of static variables to predict fluid responsiveness whenever possible. This is in sharp contrast with the recently published Guidelines on the treatment of sepsis and septic shock from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) [4]. In addition, guiding fluid resuscitation by CVP might even prove to be harmful [5, 6]. Nevertheless the use of the SSC guidelines has been reported to improve survival from severe sepsis and septic shock [7]. Both the adherence to the resuscitation and the management bundles of the guideline were associated with improved survival. Participation of an individual site in the SSC resulted in a significant drop in hospital mortality every 3 months and increases in site compliance with the resuscitation bundle significantly improved ICU and hospital length of stay. In the context of the previous part the question arises whether these important clinical effects of the SSC-guideline result from the adequacy of the targets in the guideline or the effect of protocolized and standardized care. Most likely it\u2019s a combination of effects that warrants further optimization of the SSC-guideline rather than discarding them [8].",

Three publications have contributed to this important aspect. Two publications focused on the understanding of venous return [9] and hypovolaemia [10]. These two topics are closely linked as the therapy for hypovolaemia is increasing venous return. The use of CVP in this context would be to assess whether the heart can efficiently handle the increase in venous return rather than using in increase in CVP as an indicator of adequately increased venous return [9]. In the most challenging circulatory failure (septic shock) where all aspects of the three pillars of the circulation (the vasculature, the volume and the heart) might be affected [9] the understanding the pathophysiology of cardiac failure is important as is likely to affect your treatment [11].",

In a compensated state of hypovolemia, the total blood volume (the sum of stressed and unstressed volume) is decreased while the stressed volume is maintained and therefore cardiac output may be maintained as well. This results from an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system that translates in clinical practice into decreased peripheral perfusion. An important marker of decreased peripheral perfusion is a prolonged capillary refill time [12]. Many studies have now shown that abnormal peripheral perfusion is an important warning sign in critically ill patients. Whether this is abnormal skin color [13], abnormal tissue hemoglobin saturation [14] or increased capillary refill time [15, 16]. As abnormal peripheral tissue perfusion can be corrected by specific therapy [17] the next logical step would be to incorporate the use of peripheral perfusion parameters and specific treatment into diagnostic and therapeutic protocols to define efficacy of the use of these parameters [18].",

In addition, echocardiography is noninvasive technique to sequentially evaluate cardiac function in patients with circulatory failure and thus preferred over the routine use of a pulmonary artery catheter [3]. In mechanically ventilated critically ill patients the use of lung ultrasound significantly changes clinical decisions and therapeutic management. In a study of 189 patients, therapy was changed directly in 47 % of the patients [19]. In patients the combination of lung ultrasound and echocardiography has proven to be superior to using lung ultrasound only [20]. Therefore thoracic echocardiography should be an important competence of the current curriculum of a trainee in intensive care.",

Although hydrocortisone has a vasopressor sparing effect, it doesn\u2019t seem to affect vasopressin levels nor mortality [21]. The role of both thus needs more clarification before recommendations for combined treatment can be made [23].

Since it is well recognized that beta-lactams efficacy is driven by the time the drug concentration exceeds the MIC (T > MIC) of the target pathogen, many of these strategies focused on altering infusion times. In the clinical setting, beta-lactam optimization strategies often include the use of a prolonged infusion (i.e., same dose administered over 3\u20134 h) for each dosing interval or as a continuous infusion where the total daily dose is given at a constant rate over 24 h. Each of these strategies has been reported to enhance the efficacy when compared to conventional regimens as reported by Bassetti et al. [26] in his editorial. In their interesting and intriguing study, De Waele et al. [27], using the DALI study (a prospective, multi-centre pharmacokinetic point-prevalence study) shown that in 343 critically ill patients receiving 8 different \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, antibiotic free drug concentrations remained below the MIC during 50 and 100 % of the dosing interval in 66 (19.2 %) and 142 (41.4 %) patients, respectively. The use of intermittent infusion was significantly associated with increased risk of non-attainment for both targets; creatinine clearance was independently associated with not reaching the 100 % free time above MIC (fT > MIC) target. The study demonstrated that when simulating an empirical setting where a broad range of pathogens at the susceptibility breakpoint is targeted, that target attainment using conventional \u03b2-lactam antibiotic dosing was generally inadequate. Although several factors play a role, use of intermittent infusion resulted in a three to four fold increase in the likelihood of not reaching the desired PK/PD targets. In another study, De Waele et al. [28] prospectively analyzed the effect of a dose adaption strategy using daily therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) on the target attainment for meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam when pneumonia was the primary infectious diagnosis. Forty-one patients were included in the study. Eighty-five percent of patients in the TDM group needed dose adaptation, 5 required an additional increase. At 72 h, target attainment rates for 100 % fT > 4MIC and 100 % fT > MIC were higher in the TDM group: 58 vs. 16 % (p = 0.007) and 95 vs. 68 % (p = 0.045), respectively. The study supports a strategy of dose adaptation based on daily therapeutic drug monitoring that lead to an increase in PK/PD target attainment compared to conventional dosing in critically ill patients with normal kidney function.",

Aminoglycosides are concentration dependent antibiotics, and the peak concentration over MIC is the relevant PK/PD parameter. Studies have shown that aminoglycosides have their maximal effect at a Cmax/MIC ratio of 8\u201310. This means that TDM for efficacy may be helpful to guide therapy. Based on these considerations, as well as on the decreasing susceptibility of microorganisms, actual PK-guided dosing based on individual plasma concentrations is preferable in critically ill patients. Initial therapy (before any MIC is known) should use higher doses (amikacin 25\u201330 mg/kg, gentamycin 7\u20139 mg/kg and tobramycin 7\u20139 mg/kg) to compensate for the changes described, and the Cmax of the previous dose should guide subsequent doses as reported by Dimopoulos [29] in his editorial. Under this context, recent studies shed more light on the aminoglycoside PK/PD properties in ICU patients. In a prospective study conducted by de Montmollin et al. [30] in a general ICU, 33 % of patients that receives a loading dose of amikacin of 25 mg/kg of total body weight (TBW), still had an amikacin Cmax <60 mg/L. Positive 24-h fluid balance was identified as a predictive factor of Cmax <60 mg/L. Low BMI tended to be associated with amikacin underdosing, when TBW was used, suggesting the need for higher doses in patients with a positive 24-h fluid balance. Whether these regimens are associated with improved outcomes is unknown, therefore other prospective randomized controlled studies are warranted to assess the effects of higher loading doses of amikacin on Cmax, infection control and survival, and its impact on renal and hearing functions.",

In 2010 and 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported an increased risk of mortality associated with tigecycline use in comparison with other drugs in the treatment of serious infections. The analysis used a pooled group of randomized clinical trials including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), and diabetic foot infections. On the basis of the pooled data analysis, the FDA recommended that alternatives to tigecycline should be considered in patients with severe infections. In their interesting article Montravers et al. [31] conclude that tigecyclin success rates in patients in ICU with severe infections appear comparable to those reported with other antibiotics; the overall success rate was 60 % at the end of treatment, and 53 % 7 days later. Furthermore, they report a survival rate of 85 % at day 28. Historically, clinical trials concerning management of critically ill and particularly ICU-admitted patients with tigecyclin are limited. Despite the obscure vision provided by an impressive number of meta-analyses, tigecyclin is expected to be used more often in approved indications and in off-label combination regimens for the treatment of MDR gram-negative infections in routine clinical practice. This is greatly supported by the Montravers study mentioned above. The increased medical need represented by the growing impact of multiresistant infections and the current lack of alternative or new antibiotics suggests that tigecycline benefit\u2013risk continues to be positive.",

In his interesting and complete study, Garnacho-Montero et al.

Antibiotic therapy was guided by written protocols advocating for de-escalation therapy once the microbiological results became available (day of culture results), although this decision was ultimately the responsibility of the physician in charge of the patient. By multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were septic shock, SOFA score on the day of culture results, and inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, whereas de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy was found to be a protective factor for hospital survival. Additionally, among patients receiving appropriate therapy the only factor independently associated with mortality was SOFA score on the day of culture results, whereas de-escalation therapy was again found to be a protective factor.",

Cumulative incidence of de-escalation of the empirical antimicrobial treatment among the 101 patients of the cohort, was 44 %, (95 % confidence interval, CI 38\u201353 %), including 30 (68 %) patients with ongoing neutropenia, while a microbiological documentation was available in 63 (63 %) patients.

The results shown the median duration of ICU stay was 9 [interquartile range (IQR) 5\u201322] days in the de-escalation group and 8 (IQR 4\u201315) days in the continuation group, respectively (p = 0.71). The mean difference was 3.4 (95 % CI \u22121.7 to 8.5). A superinfection occurred in 16 (27 %) patients in the de-escalation group and six (11 %) patients in the continuation group (p = 0.03).

Mortality was similar in both groups. The current study casts significant doubt whether the reduction of the spectrum of the antibiotic can be considered safe as a routine measure. The authors demonstrated that de-escalation, defined as narrowing the spectrum of the antibiotic, was inferior to continuation of the initial antibiotic therapy with length of stay as the primary outcome parameter. Furthermore, antibiotic use was higher in the de-escalation group presumably driven by the number of superinfections in the de-escalation group. A key element in the study of the potential role of de-escalation is a uniform definition of de-escalation.

With these measures, they were able to reduce pneumonia from an incidence rate of 32 cases to 1000 ventilator days in the 6 months period before the study to 10 cases per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation during the 6 months following the study. Oral chlorhexidine rinsing in the preoperative period (OR, 17) and on the day of surgery significantly were significantly protective for post-operative pneumonia. Oral chlorhexidine rinses and dental hygiene are cheap, easy and effective measures for preventing pneumonia after cardiac surgery.",

Although there are variations due to heterogeneous information sources and variety of local clinical practices, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacteriaceae species are the pathogens most frequently responsible for nosocomial bacteremia. Energy deficit in ICU patients is mainly caused by reduced intake due to under-prescribed calories and frequent feeding interruptions. Cumulated energy deficit build-up during the first days of ICU stay appears an independent factor contributing to nosocomial infections. In their interesting study, Ekpe et al. [47] investigated the impact of energy deficit on the microbiological results of the blood cultures of prolonged acute mechanically ventilated patients who experienced a first ICU-BSI episode. Daily energy balance was compared according to the microbiological results of the blood cultures of 92 consecutive prolonged (>96 h) acute mechanically ventilated patients who developed a first episode of ICU-BSI. Among the 92 ICU-BSI, 9 were due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The cumulated energy deficit of patients with MRSA ICU-BSI was greater than those with ICUBSI caused by other pathogens. ICU admission, risk factors for nosocomial infections, nutritional status, and conditions potentially limiting feeding did not differ significantly between the two groups. Patients with MRSA ICU-BSI had lower delivered energy and similar energy expenditure, causing higher energy deficits. More severe energy deficit and higher rate of MRSA blood cultures (p = 0.01 comparing quartiles) were observed. The conclusions of the study were that early in-ICU energy deficit was associated with MRSA ICU-BSI in prolonged acute mechanically ventilated patients. Results suggest that limiting the early energy deficit could be a way to optimize MRSA ICU-BSI prevention.",

Half of emergency admissions to PICU in the UK occur after stabilisation at other hospitals. In their study Harron et al.

Multivariable regression showed no significant difference in rates of PICU-acquired BSI by source of admission (incidence-rate ratio for inter-hospital transfer versus within-hospital admission = 0.97, 95 % CI 0.87\u20131.07) after adjusting for other risk-factors.

Invasive candidiasis and candidaemia are difficult to predict and early diagnosis remains a major challenge. In addition, microbiological documentation occurs often late in the course of infection. Delays in initiating appropriate treatment have been associated with increased mortality. In an attempt to decrease Candida-related mortality, an increasing number of critically ill patients without documented candida infections receive empirical systemic antifungal therapy, leading to concern for antifungal overuse. Scores/predictive rules permit the stratification and selection of high risk patients who may benefit from early antifungal therapy. However, they have a far better negative predictive value than positive predictive value. New biomarkers [mannan, antimannan, (1,3)-\u03b2-D-glucan and polymerase chain reaction] are being increasingly used to enable earlier diagnosis and, ideally, to provide prognostic information and/or therapeutic monitoring.

[37] reported the active hospital-based surveillance program of incident episodes of candidemia in twenty-four tertiary care hospitals in Paris area. Among 2507 adult cases included, 2571 Candida isolates were collected and species were C. albicans (56 %), C. glabrata (18.6 %), C. parapsilosis (11.5 %), C. tropicalis (9.3 %), C. krusei (2.9 %) and C. kefyr (1.8 %). Candidemia occurred in ICU in 1206 patients (48.1 %). When comparing ICU vs. non-ICU patients, the former had significantly more frequent surgery during the past 30 days, were more often pre-exposed to fluconazole and treated with echinocandin, and were less frequently infected with C. parapsilosis. A significant increased incidence in the overall population and ICU was found. Echinocandins initial therapy increased over time in ICU (4.6 % first year of study, to 48.5 % last year of study, p < 0.0001). ICU patients had a higher day 30 death rate than non-ICU patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.12, 95 % CI 1.66\u20132.72, p < 0.0001]. The day 30 and early (<day 8) death rates increased over time in ICU (from 41.5 % the first to 56.9 % the last year of study (p = 0.001) and 28.7\u201338.8 % (p = 0.0292), respectively). The authors concluded that the availability of new antifungals and the publication of numerous guidelines did not prevent an increase of candidaemia and death in ICU patients in Paris area. Apparently in contrast with the Paris study, Colombo et al. [38] retrospectively analyzed 1392 episodes of candidaemia in adult patients (647 in ICU) from 22 Brazilian hospitals. Comparing the characteristics of candidaemia in ICU patients in 2 periods (2003\u20132007, period 1 and 2008\u20132012, period 2), and assessed predictors of 30-day mortality. They reported that 30-day mortality rate decreased from 76.4 % in period 1\u201360.8 % in period 2 (p < 0.001). Predictors of 30-day mortality by multivariate analysis were older age, period 1, receipt of corticosteroids and higher APACHE II score, while treatment with an echinocandin were associated with a higher probability of survival. The authors concluded that the incorporation of echinocandins as primary therapy of candidemia seems to be associated with better outcome. As in bacterial infections however, adequate treatment remains of paramount importance in treating infections in critically ill patients. Also in patients with candida blood stream infections, inadequate source control and antifungal treatment have been associated with increased mortality [51]. Another important phenomenon in the management of Candida infections is represented by the emergence of resistance in Candida spp. Antifungal drug resistance was considered less problematic in Candida spp. than in other pathogens, but recent increases in resistance to both echinocandins and azoles have led to clinical failures. In their extensive review Maubon et al. [39] reported that acquired fluconazole resistance is frequent in C. glabrata (from 4 to 16 %), which increasingly displays cross-resistance to voriconazole. So far, multi-drug resistant phenotype against azole and echinocandins, has only been described for C. glabrata and is a matter of serious concern. Fluconazole resistance remains uncommon in C. albicans (<5 %), but is more prevalent in C. parapsilosis (4\u201310 %) and C. tropicalis (4\u20139 %), however recent data shows that may reflect geographical differences. Acquired resistance to echinocandins is increasingly reported for most of the clinically important Candida spp. It remains uncommon in C. albicans (<1 %), C. tropicalis (<5 %) and C. krusei (<7 %), but is now becoming frequent in C. glabrata (8\u201315 %).",

Candida has a low affinity for alveolar pneumocytes and histologically documented pneumonia has been rarely reported. Hematogenous dissemination in the context of candidemia may be responsible for multiple pulmonary abscesses and should be viewed as a distinct entity. Hence the existence of true candidal pneumonia is doubtful and recovery of Candida spp. from the respiratory tract should generally be considered as colonization and does not justify antifungal therapy. In their double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pilot randomized trial, Martin et al. [40] tried to demonstrate a benefit of antifungal therapy in critically ill patients with positive airway secretion specimens for Candida spp. They recruited 60 patients into the randomized trial: 29 patients specifically treated with antifungals. Markers of inflammation and all clinical outcomes were comparable between placebo and antifungal treatment group at baseline and over time. At baseline, plasma TNF-alpha levels were higher in the patients colonized with Candida compared to the observational group (mean \u00b1 SD) (21.8 \u00b1 23.1 vs. 12.4 \u00b1 9.3 pg/ml p = 0.02) and that these patients had lower innate immune function as evidenced by reduced whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha production capacity (854.8 \u00b1 855.2 vs. 1559.4 \u00b1 1290.6 pg/ml p = 0.01). This study does not provide evidence to support a larger trial examining the efficacy of empiric antifungal treatment in patients with Candida in the endotracheal secretions. Similar negative impact in duration of mechanical ventilation has been obtained with inhaled amphotericin-B patients with airway colonization with Candida sp. Ampho-B inhalation therapy was not associated with increased decolonization and might even prolong duration of mechanical ventilation possibly due to the toxicity of the drug on the lungs [52].",

In this piece they highlighted the very few published randomised studies (5) and prospective cohort studies (10) which represent the best data on NIV in paediatric critical illness currently available. One of the problems around generating evidence is the variety of techniques, triggering mechanisms, patient interfaces as well as options for patient selection and timing. These combine to make good research in this area difficult. However this is no excuse for not attempting it. Argent and Biban put it clearly: Non-invasive techniques have potential to \u201csubstantially improve the safety of ventilator support for children, and improve access to ventilatory support for both acute and chronic conditions.

Strikingly a 50 % survival of ECMO in both solid and haematological cancer patients was seen\u2014though the post hematopoietic stem cell transplant group did uniformly badly.",
