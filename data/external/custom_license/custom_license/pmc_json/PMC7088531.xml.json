H9N2 are significantly important due to their extensive circulation in domestic poultry in different regions of world from the Far East to the Middle East (Fusaro et al. 2011). Genetic analysis of H9N2 viruses has showed extensive re-assortment of these viruses with many subtypes of AIVs including HPAI H5N1 and H7N3 viruses (Chaudhry et al. 2015; Fusaro et al. 2011).",

To date, very little information is available on spatial clustering of H9 infection in this region. Awareness about risk factors responsible for disease introduction and spatial clustering is critically important in developing risk-based surveillance strategies, policies, and timely recommendation for control. The primary objectives of this study were to calculate attack rate (AR) of H9N2 infection and to identify risk factors associated with this infection among poultry farms of Pakistan. The other objective was to identify any clustering of unusually high number of H9 cases than expected for early detection of any emerging outbreak of this disease in different areas of Pakistan when only the number of cases is available.",

(Maryland, USA) was used (available at http://www.satscan.org). The prospective space-time permutation scan statistic module was used to detect a local excess of events and to test if this excess could have occurred by chance (Hyder et al. 2011). This method consists of thousands of cylinders that move across space and/or time. Each cylinder has a base, which represents geographical area (in this study, a commercial farm), and height, which is time (in this study, a day). The base of each cylinder comprised a maximum of 50 % of the population, while height was a maximum of 50 % of the study time (60 days). The cylinder with more observed cases than expected, with respect to cases reported outside the cylinder, is called \u201cmost likely cluster.\u201d For each location and size of the cylinder, the number of observed and expected cases is counted. Among these, the most \u201cunusual\u201d excess of observed cases is noted. The statistical significance of this cluster is then evaluated taking into account the multiple testing stemming from the many potential cluster locations and sizes evaluated (Kulldorff et al. 2005).

The reason for this high AR could be the high density of commercial poultry farms in these districts. Association of HPAI H5N1 and high and medium density of poultry farms has been studied and was identified as a risk factor in different countries (Henning et al. 2009; Abbas et al. 2012). Poultry farm densities in these regions ranged from 0.05 to 4 farms per square kilometer (Hamilton et al. 2009). As distance between the farms plays a significant role in the transmission of infection, poultry farms in these areas are exposed almost every year during the endemic (Abbas et al. 2012; Chaudhry et al. 2015). Furthermore, in densely populated poultry areas, movement of vehicles and people from farm to farm is considerably high, subsequently facilitating the spread of this virus through fomites. In the current study, the two districts (Lahore and Kasur) are on the main highway road (Grand Trunk road), which have a significant number of commercial poultry farms alongside. The vehicles over loaded with infected birds or mortality move on this road routinely. Previously, many studies have demonstrated that proximity to major roads was associated with avian influenza (Ward et al. 2008; Chaudhry et al. 2015). Movement of veterinarian and para-veterinary staff between different farms to implement control measures or to investigate mortalities can also contribute to the spread of virus among farms. In Pakistan, poultry farmers who apply strict biosecurity measures sometimes relax these rules for visitors, who enter the bird areas (Chaudhry et al. 2015).",
