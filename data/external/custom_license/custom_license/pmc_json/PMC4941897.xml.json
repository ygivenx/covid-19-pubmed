            "text": "Influenza viruses, members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, are enveloped viruses with segmented, single\u2010stranded, negative\u2010sense RNA packaged in virions as ribonucleoproteins. Influenza viruses are further classified into three genera, A, B and C, on the basis of the antigenic diversity of virion proteins such as the matrix protein (M1) and nucleocapsid protein (NP). Further classification is based on the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins protruding from the viral envelope of influenza A and B viruses. Human influenza viruses mainly cause acute respiratory disease with high incidence and mortality, usually as epidemics but sometimes as worldwide pandemics. To date, 16 different influenza A virus HA subtypes (H1\u2013H16) and nine different NA subtypes (N1\u2013N9) have been identified in wild waterfowl, which are the major reservoir of all influenza A viruses. All mammalian influenza viruses are believed to originate from avian influenza A viruses, and only three subtypes of influenza A virus, H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2, have adapted to humans since 1918.\n1\n The causative viruses of the 1957 Asian (H2N2) and 1968 Hong Kong (H3N2) pandemics were found to be reassortants of human and avian influenza A viruses,\n2\n, \n3\n whereas the 1918 Spanish (H1N1) influenza A virus was likely to be entirely of avian origin but adapted to humans.\n4\n When H1N1 reappeared in 1977, H3N2 did not disappear but continued to circulate; therefore, currently, together with their H1N2 reassortant, three subtypes of influenza A virus are associated with epidemics. The ongoing zoonotic outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza A virus have raised concerns that the situation may develop into a pandemic comparable in magnitude with the Spanish influenza virus pandemic.",

SA\u03b12,3 is found on alveolar cells, whereas SA\u03b12,6, with a few exceptions, is predominantly found on non\u2010alveolar cells (Table 1). This correlates reasonably well with the predominant manifestations caused by human influenza A virus infection (rhinitis, pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis), indicating replication in the respiratory tract.\n18\n Importantly, the distribution of SA\u03b12,3 and SA\u03b12,6 also correlates with reports of lower respiratory tract symptoms and the difficulty in detecting H5N1 in nasopharyngeal samples,\n19\n and with the replication of H5N1 in cells lining the alveoli.\n20\n Specifically, SA\u03b12,6 predominates on M cells in nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue\n21\n and on epithelial cells in the nasal mucosa,\n22\n paranasal sinuses,\n22\n pharynx,\n22\n larynx,\n23\n trachea,\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n trachea/bronchi,\n25\n, \n26\n bronchi\n22\n, \n24\n, \n27\n and in bronchioles,\n13\n, \n22\n but not on alveolar cells.\n24\n, \n28\n Goblet cells in the larynx,\n23\n trachea\n13\n, \n23\n and bronchi\n13\n, \n24\n may also contain SA\u03b12,6.

SA\u03b12,6\u2010binding viruses, such as human influenza A and B viruses, coronavirus OC43, polyomavirus JC and human parainfluenza virus 3, are more frequently isolated from the respiratory tract than from the eye. The human eye, on the other hand, apparently constitutes a very efficient replication site for at least three unrelated viruses with specificity for SA\u03b12,3. Ad37 was isolated for the first time in 1976\n30\n and has been demonstrated to be one of the most frequent agents of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). \n31\n The large amounts of Ad37 detected in eye swabs from EKC patients\n32\n are consistent with the observations that Ad37 is readily transmitted via direct or indirect contact\n33\n and that EKC is common in densely populated areas of the world.\n34\n EV70 was first isolated during a pandemic of a highly contagious form of acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) that originated in Ghana in 1969\n35\n and subsequently spread through Africa to Asia. EV70 was also responsible for a second pandemic of AHC in the early 1980s\n36\n that included both the eastern and western hemispheres, and for numerous regional outbreaks. Like Ad37, EV70 also uses SA\u03b12,3 as a cellular receptor.\n7\n The third virus that binds to SA\u03b12,3 is NDV,\n9\n a virus of domestic fowl that has been associated with several zoonotic outbreaks of conjunctivitis among poultry and kitchen workers and with case reports of laboratory infection.\n37\n The ability of these three viruses (Ad37, EV70 and NDV) to utilize the eye as a primary site of replication further emphasizes the potential role of the eye as a gateway for infections caused by other viruses that use SA\u03b12,3 as a receptor. Therefore, it is important to highlight the potential of ocular SA, in general, as a receptor and of ocular SA\u03b12,3 in particular, as a primary target of previously unrecognized importance for human infection by other viruses, including avian influenza A virus.",

Conjunctivitis caused by H7 subtypes of avian influenza A virus has been reported sporadically over the years,\n52\n, \n53\n, \n54\n, \n55\n and both before and after the zoonotic outbreak of H7N7 in the Netherlands in 2003.\n56\n During this outbreak, one person died of respiratory failure; however, conjunctivitis was the major manifestation observed. It was recently demonstrated that virus isolated from this outbreak was capable of direct binding to human conjunctival tissue.\n57\n H7N7 influenza virus replication in the eyes of patients was high, and similar to the level of replication of cocirculating human influenza H3N2 virus in patients with respiratory tract infection.\n56\n While it seems clear that the human eye is the initial and main site of replication for some H7 viruses, this is not obvious for other avian influenza A viruses. While avian H5N1 viruses replicate in the respiratory tract, mainly in alveolar cells\n20\n that express SA\u03b12,3,\n22\n the potential for H5N1 influenza A virus replication in the eye needs further attention. H5N1 was reported to be associated with conjunctivitis during the outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997\n42\n and in Turkey in 2005\u20132006.\n58\n Importantly, 14/37 (37%) of Egyptian patients with H5N1 exhibited conjunctivitis.\n59\n Additional information indicates that the eye may be an initial site of replication for H5N1 virus in humans. For example, a Belgian veterinarian who investigated two H5N1\u2010positive Thai eagles developed conjunctivitis 2 days after examination of the eagles, but no respiratory symptoms.\n60\n This raises the question whether H5N1 may use the human eye as a portal of entry preceeding transmission to the respiratory tract.\n5\n This possibility is supported by the relatively longer incubation period in humans for H5N1 avian influenza A virus (normally 4\u20137 days)\n58\n than for human H3N2 (normally 1\u20134 days),\n18\n avian H7N3 (1\u20133 days)\n61\n and avian H7N7 (1 day),\n62\n, \n63\n as well as the low frequency of virus detection and the relatively low viral load in nasopharyngeal samples from zoonotic H5N1 patients.\n19\n Also consistent with this idea is that one of the Turkish patients who developed respiratory symptoms of zoonotic H5N1 in the 2005\u20132006 outbreak presented with conjunctivitis.\n58\n, \n64\n Recent work in animal models has confirmed that avian H7 viruses that replicate in mouse eyes (but not H5 or human H3 viruses) cause lethal disease following ocular infection of mice.\n65\n At present, it is unclear why H5 viruses are much less frequently associated with conjunctivitis in humans than are H7 viruses. Glycan arrays can be used to identify sialylated glycans recognized by influenza virus and other viruses.\n66\n, \n67\n, \n68\n A recent study using glycan arrays\n66\n showed differences in the sialic acid\u2010binding specificity of influenza virus H7 isolates. European and North American isolates associated with conjunctivitis exhibited a strong preference for binding SA\u03b12,3; however, the pattern of binding for the European isolates more closely paralleled binding of classic avain influenza viruses, while the North American isolates showed reduced binding to glycans containing SA\u03b12,3 and increased binding to glycans containing SA\u03b12,6. Virus binding was skewed even more towards glycans containing SA\u03b12,6 for North American H7 isolates that were not associated with conjunctivitis. Glycan array analysis will be an important tool for unravelling the complex inter\u2010relationship between sialic acid\u2010binding specificity and influenza virus tropism and pathogenicity. However, for identification of the specific sialic acid\u2010containing cellular receptors used by influenza A viruses, additional experimental approaches are required.",

Moreover, human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of avian H5N1 influenza A virus is inefficient,\n70\n which is compatible with virus replication that is limited to the lower respiratory tract,\n20\n and there are no reported cases of human\u2010to\u2010human transmission by small\u2010particle aerosols.\n70\n However, influenza infection in the human eye represents a potential source for transmission between humans, but not necessarily a signal of an imminent pandemic.
