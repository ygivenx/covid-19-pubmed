Because persons\nwith MERS often do not report any of these risk factors, we investigated MERS cases in\nSaudi Arabia during an apparent period of limited hospital transmission. Through\ntelephone interviews of case-patients and information from routine investigations, we\naimed to characterize exposures and to explore additional factors potentially important\nin disease transmission. We also genetically sequenced MERS-CoV from respiratory\nspecimens to identify circulating strains.",
