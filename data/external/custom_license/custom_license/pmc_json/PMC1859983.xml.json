Nm and typable Hi (THi) can invade the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier to cause septicaemia and meningitis, which in the case of Nm, may rapidly become life threatening (van Deuren et al., 2000). Non-typable Hi (NTHi), which lack a polysaccharide capsule, are associated with localized respiratory tract and conjunctival infections (Foxwell et al., 1998). Strains belonging to Hi-biogroup aegyptius (Hi-aeg) are also associated with Brazilian purpuric fever (Foxwell et al., 1998). The factors that determine susceptibility to infection by these frequent colonizers are not entirely clear.",

Several members of the CEACAM subgroup are expressed on human epithelial cells and include the widely expressed transmembrane CEACAM1 as well asGPI-anchored CEA and CEACAM6. All CEACAMs have an N-terminal IgV-like domain and variable numbers of IgC2-like A and B domains. CEACAM1 comprises up to four extracellular domains: N, A1, B and A2 and either a long or a short cytoplasmic tail (Tsutsumi et al., 1990; Prall et al., 1996; Hammarstrom, 1999). Various functions have been attributed to CEACAM1 including cell\u2013cell adhesion, insulin regulation and angiogenesis (Obrink, 1997; Hammarstrom, 1999; Wagener and Ergun, 2000; Najjar, 2002). Targeting of CEACAMs by N. gonorrhoeae, as well as Nm and Hi leads to cellular invasion and passage across polarized monolayers (Virji et al., 1999; Gray-Owen, 2003; M. Soriani, K. Setchfield, D.J. Hill, and M. Virji, unpublished data).",

            "text": "A wide range of bacterial adhesins are involved in targeting the CEACAM N-terminal domains and includes Opa proteins, a major adhesin family of pathogenic Neisseria and P5 proteins of Hi (Chen and Gotschlich, 1996; Virji et al., 1996a; Hill et al., 2001). Nm and N. gonorrhoeae contain multiple copies of Opa genes that encode conserved domains which form \u03b2-barrel structures in bacterial membranes and variable domains that form surface exposed loops. In spite of the surface diversity afforded by the hyper-variable domains of the loops, the majority of the Opa proteins are capable of targeting CEACAMs (Virji et al., 1996a; Hauck and Meyer, 2003). The P5 proteins of Hi are similar \u03b2-barrel forming proteins, also with surface variable loops (Webb and Cripps, 1998; Vandeputte-Rutten et al., 2003). The interactions between these bacterial ligands and CEACAMs are complex and the binding domain appears to involve more than one variable loop of the bacterial adhesins (Virji et al., 1999; Bos et al., 2002; de Jonge et al., 2003). Interestingly, antibody inhibition studies have shown that the diverse ligands of neisseria and haemophilus bind to an overlapping site on the N-domain. In addition, mutational analysis of the N-domain of CEACAM1 has identified several critical residues particularly Ile-91. Alanine substitutions at these sites abrogated binding of most Opa- and P5-expressing bacteria to CEACAM1. Additional residues such as Tyr-34, Ser-32, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, most of which located in the vicinity of Ile-91, appear to determine the efficiency of interactions of various Opa and P5 molecules (Virji et al., 1999; 2000). The bacterial binding surface on the CEACAM1 N-domain is the protein face composed of the beta strands C\u2032\u2032, C\u2032, C, F and G (CFG for brevity). Despite the extensive investigations in a number of laboratories particularly on neisserial Opa proteins, it remains unclear as to precisely how CEACAM-binding ligands engage with the receptors.",

In the current investigation, we have refined our previous model based on murine CEACAM1 crystal structure (Tan et al., 2002). Examination of this model showed a better confluence of the above residues into a continuous binding site and suggested that substitutions at positions 34 and 89 at the core of the binding region may affect bacterial access to the implicated key binding residue Ile-91. By introducing conservative and non-conservative substitutions at positions 34, 89 and 91, we have examined the binding of a variety of bacterial strains to the receptor constructs. The data suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in individuals or populations that may introduce substitutions in CEACAM sequence particularly at the bacterial binding site, could not only decrease but also significantly increase the functional affinity of pathogen interactions. Increased binding affinity may result in increased cellular invasion and thus may lead to increased host susceptibility to infection by CEACAM-targeting bacteria.",

In this model, whilst most mutations affecting binding of Nm and Hi were located centrally on the CFG face of the protein, Val-39 involved in Opa binding, was located at a distance towards the bottom of the CFG face (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, a crystal structure of murine soluble CEACAM1a domains 1 and 4 was reported (Tan et al., 2002). Based on this, we have remodelled the human CEACAM1 N-domain. The CC\u2032 loop that contains Val-39 folds back against the CFG face of this model such that it lies in close proximity to the other critical residues involved in bacterial adhesion (Fig. 1B). Further examination of this model suggested that the bacterial binding pocket forms a rather flat surface in the centre of the CFG face. It also appears that substituting neighbouring residues Tyr-34 and Gln-89 by Phe and Asn, respectively, could result in a further flattening of the bacterial binding surface (Fig. 1C\u2013E), providing increased access to the key Ile-91. These residue changes also increase the size of the hydrophobic patch centred on I91 (Fig. 1C\u2013E). Both of these effects might facilitate binding of some bacterial ligands to the target receptor.",

Alanine substitution of Tyr-34 abrogated the binding of Rd and Eagan, whereas no effect on NTHi A950002 was observed. In contrast, Y34F substitution led to an increased binding of all three strains varying from 45 to 80% above native receptor binding levels, whereas Y34S had a differential effect on the three strains tested, ranging from no binding of Rd to a slight increase in the binding of A950002.

In previous investigations, we have shown that certain isolates of the two bacteria are capable of competing with the native receptor and that Nm C751 derivatives can displace Ha3 as well as Eagan from the receptor (Virji et al., 2000). Here we investigated how changes in receptor structure at position 89 may influence this phenomenon. We used receptor dot blot overlay in the presence of varying amounts of the soluble receptor constructs to estimate the ability of C751OpaB and Ha3 to selectively adsorb the receptor. Consistent with the lower affinity of Ha3 compared with C751OpaB/D for CEACAM1 (Virji et al., 2000), the proportion of the native CEACAM1 that interacted with Ha3 compared with C751OpaB was lower and declined further at limiting concentrations of the receptor (Fig. 6A). In contrast, Ha3 and C751OpaB had similar affinities for the receptor when the Q89N construct was present in excess (> 0.13 \u03bcg ml\u22121; Fig. 6B). Further, at limiting concentrations of Q89N, the greater affinity of Ha3 was apparent and bound this construct threefold more than the Nm derivative (Fig. 6B). The data demonstrate the potential influence of structural modulations at the bacterial binding site in changing the colonization profile of the target tissue.",

Initially, binding of the anti-CEACAM antibodies to transfected CHO cells was examined and their binding was as observed for the soluble receptors (Fig. 7). However, bacterially expressed ligands may overcome decreased affinity for specific mutant proteins due to multiple ligand-receptor engagement at the target cell surface. Examination of adherent bacteria and levels of receptor expression by microscopy revealed that bacteria bound to all transfectants other than sham-transfected cells (Fig. 8). However, receptor expression levels had to be considerably high in the case of I91A for significant bacterial numbers to bind the transfectants. Whereas for Q89A and Q89N, bacteria could bind to cells with barely detectable levels of receptors (Fig. 8).",

However, some Nm Opa proteins can also tolerate I91T substitution. Tyr-34 is also required in most cases. Interestingly, Phe-34 is preferred in general at this position over the native Tyr. Substitutions at Gln-89 have a deleterious effect on binding of some Nm Opa derivatives and the smaller Q89N apparently is better suited overall for binding by Hi and especially Hi-aeg strains.

Despite the structural variability, all Opa proteins target a common site on the receptors whose centre of binding appears to be Ile-91 on the CFG face of the N-domains. Ile-91 is conserved throughout the CEA members. Most of the other important residues on CEACAM1 identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis located in a close proximity of Ile-91 (Virji et al., 1999). Precisely how variant Opa proteins can bind to a common receptor site is not entirely clear but a complementary set of sequences of more than one variable domains of Opa proteins may be involved. This variability of the ligands may determine the binding preference for distinct members of the CEA family which represents one mechanism that may determine tissue tropism (Virji et al., 1999; Bos et al., 2002; Gray-Owen, 2003; Hauck and Meyer, 2003; de Jonge et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Diverse strains of typable and NTHi lineages including the biogroup aegyptius also bind to the CFG face of the N-domain of CEACAM1 (Virji et al., 2000). In our previous analysis of receptor binding, THi isolates were shown to behave similarly: each strain tested having a primary requirement for Ile-91 and in addition, was affected by Y34A and Q44A substitutions. In the current study also, the THi strain Rd and Eagan demonstrate similar overall binding patterns. However, in all cases, intraspecies differences in response to different amino acid substitutions were apparent. One consistency between all species and strains tested was the dramatic loss of binding following I91A substitution which, as observed previously, appears to be central in an overlapping bacterial binding footprint on CEACAM1 (Virji et al., 1999; 2000). A similar situation occurs on the mouse CEACAM1a (MHVR1a) N-terminal domain, in which Ile-41 appears to engage with the mouse hepatitis virus spike protein. Replacement of Ile-41 by Thr in the MHVR1b allele reduces virus binding significantly (Tan et al., 2002). Cell surface receptor interactions with their ligands often involve hydrophobic contact points which provides the major binding energy. Hydrophobic residues surrounding these contribute to the specificity of binding (Clackson and Wells, 1995; Kwong et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2001). Thus in murine CEACAM1, the protruding Ile-41, which is surrounded by a number of surface exposed charged residues, e.g. Asp-42, Glu-44, Arg-47, Asp89, Glu-93 and Arg-97, might form such a binding area (Tan et al., 2002). Accordingly from current studies also, mutations introduced at position 91 in the human receptor support the requirement for a hydrophobic pocket at this site. In addition, an extended aliphatic chain is preferred as Ala disrupted binding of all bacteria and the polar Thr reduced binding of all Hi and several Nm strains. Only I91L was more frequently tolerated. This binding pocket is flanked by several polar residues (Fig. 1) whose contribution to bacterial ligand binding is apparent and variable (Virji et al., 1999; 2000).",

Further, the aromatic ring of Tyr-34 suggested to be required to maintain the convoluted structure of the CC\u2032 loop (Tan et al., 2002) when substituted with Phe almost always supported bacterial binding. Indeed, Y34F provides a better environment for most bacterial strains tested. On the other hand, Y34A frequently abrogated receptor recognition. However and surprisingly, Y34S is tolerated by a substantial number of bacterial ligands. Whether this is due to the flexible variable loop domains of the bacterial ligands which may produce an induced fit around the receptor needs consideration. Interestingly, Tyr-34 is conserved in the majority of the human CEACAMs with the exception of CEACAM4 which contains His at this site. However, the importance of Tyr-34 in human CEACAM1 maintaining the three dimensional structure requires human receptor crystallographic data.",

Whilst Q89A and Q89N appear to affect some Opa proteins by reducing receptor recognition, suggesting its potential contribution in determining tissue tropism (Virji et al., 1999), Q89N substitution occasionally caused dramatic increase in bacterial adhesion, especially of Hi isolates. Y34F, as observed above, increased binding of strains within all species examined. As it is possible that multiple receptors presented on the target cells may overcome the reduced binding affinity of mutated receptors, we examined strain Rd binding to I91A and Q89A/N-substituted receptors expressed in transiently transfected COS cells. Whilst the latter receptors were targeted on cells with low levels of receptor expression, only a proportion (c. 50%) of cells with very high levels of I91A receptors had significant numbers of bacteria attached. Thus point mutations of CEACAMs can both decrease and increase bacterial load and additional factors that dictate bacterial binding include receptor levels on the target cells.",

This strain is related to strain MC58, one of the strains used in the current study. The studies of de Jonge et al. implicated G \u00d7 (I/V/l) \u00d7 (S/E/Q) as the key motifs of HV2 regions (Fig. 9) of meningococcal Opa proteins in receptor targeting.

Within the strain C751, OpaB and OpaD proteins contain the motif GxLxS at positions 172\u2013176 and 167\u2013171, respectively, whereas Opa A contains a 168PxIxN motif.

Some SNPs may lead to multiple and diverse downstream effects, e.g. altered transcriptional response and manifestation of disease (Sakuntabhai et al., 2005). Extracellular domain polymorphisms may have a more direct effect via altered binding of pathogen ligands to their receptors. SNPs of the innate immune system especially those affecting pathogen associated pattern recognition receptors and cytokines have been studied extensively. Changes such as Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile in the extracellular domains of LPS-binding Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) have been implicated in increased risk to bacterial infections (Schroder and Schumann, 2005). These SNPs have also been associated with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in infants. In this case, altered interaction of the viral fusion (F) protein, implicated as a ligand for TLR4, is regarded as the primary mechanism (Tal et al., 2004; Schroder and Schumann, 2005). However, these TLR4 SNPs could not be correlated with meningococcal disease (Read et al., 2001). In contrast, rare SNPs were found more commonly in the TLR4 genes of patients with meningococcal disease (Smirnova et al., 2003). This supports the notion that rare rather than common variants of TLR4 may be associated with infectious disease susceptibility.",

            "text": "Studies presented here suggest some possible polymorphisms that can increase bacterial load. Several SNPs in CEACAMs have been identified and are listed in the NCBI SNP database and three have been identified in the N-domain of CEACAM1 including one at Gln-89. In this case, a Gln-89 to His substitution is observed. Such a residue difference occurs within the members of CEACAM family. For example, CEA contains H at position 89 (Fig. 2). This is the only major difference between CC1 and CEA that could affect bacterial binding (Fig. 2). As such, the mutation Q89H in CC1 would be expected to produce CEA-like binding pattern and could affect tropism of the bacteria as observed for CEA (Virji et al., 1999; de Jonge et al., 2003). Further studies are required to assess whether other CEACAM polymorphisms, for example, substitutions such as Y34F and Q89N occur in human populations and their frequencies in susceptible populations. SNP substitutions may also change the colonization profile of the nasopharynx, because in our competition studies we could demonstrate that increased binding afforded by Q89N to Hi-aeg isolate Ha3 increases the binding of Ha3 such that it out-competes Nm isolate C751OpaB in an in vitro competition assay for this receptor. The situation with the native receptor was the reverse. As shown in Figs 8 and 9, additional factors that affect bacterial binding to cell-expressed receptor include receptor density. Whilst certain residue substitutions, e.g. I91A, reduce functional affinity of bacterial interactions, high receptor densities increase such affinity. The final outcome must depend on the interplay between these two parameters. In recent studies, the role of receptor density on enhancement of bacterial attachment and invasion have been evaluated in detail (Bradley et al., 2005; Rowe et al., 2006). It would be interesting to analyse bacterial invasion in cell lines expressing variant CEACAM1 carrying the above mutations by employing cell lines in which the receptor expression levels can be controlled, which are under development.",

            "text": "Besides receptor polymorphisms, several other scenarios may lead to increased bacterial ligand binding to CEACAMs. Both Nm and Hi CEACAM-binding ligands (Opa and P5) are known to undergo antigenic variation. Thus, in any population, antigenic/structural variants are present and may be selected for during the course of host colonization and subsequent pathogenesis (Virji et al., 1996a; Duim et al., 1997; Meyers et al., 2003). The receptor repertoire and subtypes may select bacteria capable of binding with high affinity. As mentioned above, upregulation of receptor expression on target cells may also increase bacterial binding affinity. In such cases, high affinity interactions result in cellular invasion, whereas lower affinity or load of bacteria may not proceed beyond surface adhesion (Tran Van Nhieu and Isberg, 1993; Bradley et al., 2005). The expression of CEACAMs on normal epithelia of the respiratory tract has been reported, which would allow bacterial attachment and possible subsequent penetration into these tissues (Tsutsumi et al., 1990; Virji, 2001). Following exposure to cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1, CEACAM expression by colonic carcinoma cells has been shown to increase (Fahlgren et al., 2003). In addition, certain viral infections have also been shown to upregulate CEACAM1 expression in several epithelial cell lines (Avadhanula et al., 2006). Increased cytokine levels following viral infection could lead to increased CEACAM expression and bacterial association with respiratory epithelia and subsequent invasion of deeper tissue by these organisms. Such a situation may explain the epidemiological association of increased incidence of Nm and Hi infections following certain viral infections (Cartwright et al., 1991; Takala et al., 1993).",

Interestingly, opportunistic pathogens such as Nm and Hi as well as M. catarrhalis (not investigated here) target CEACAM1. As specific substitutions such as Y > F and Q > N produce more favourable targets for distinct mucosal isolates, it is possible that occurrence of such receptor polymorphisms in the human population could lead to greater bacterial binding thus increasing the chances of cellular invasion. Given the colonization rate of these organisms (generally > 10% of the population) and the frequency of invasive infection (up to 3:100 000 population), a combination of events may be required to increase host susceptibility. Inflammatory conditions that increase receptor density in populations carrying specific polymorphisms could provide the worst scenario.",

Final refinement of the model was performed by soaking it with a 5 \u00c5 thick layer of water and energy minimizing while constraining the backbone atoms to their original positions in the template structure. The final round of minimization was for 2000 conjugate-gradient steps, constraining the backbone heavy atoms with a force constant of 0.5 kcal/\u00c5. A stereochemical analysis of the structure was performed using Procheck and found to be of similar quality to the template crystal structure.",

The interactions of bacteria with the cell-expressed receptors were investigated in the absence (A, D) or presence of competing soluble receptors. Although binding to the soluble receptor Q89N is much lower than the native CC1 in dot-blots (Fig. 3B), it is relatively high on certain cells (presumably, on those expressing high levels of the receptor) (D). In competitive experiments, the native CC1-Fc (B, E) and the CC1(Q89N)-Fc (C, F) were preincubated at 10 ug ml\u22121 with bacteria for 15 min, prior to infection of target cells. CC1-Fc inhibited bacterial binding to the homologous receptor significantly (B), and almost abrogated binding to cell-expressed Q89N (E); whereas the soluble Q89N was inefficient at inhibiting bacterial binding to CHO-CC1 (C). However, a level of homologous inhibition was apparent when examining the adhesion of bacteria to cells expressing low levels of the receptor (e.g. \u2018peppered\u2019 areas shown in D are less evident in F).",
