Therefore, the CFR will typically be higher among detected cases than among the entire population of cases, given that the latter may include individuals with mild, subclinical, and (under some definitions of \u201ccase\u201d) asymptomatic presentations. Laboratory confirmation as an inclusion criterion may reduce this bias if it is able to detect a wider spectrum of presentations, or may exacerbate it if the probability of receiving a laboratory test is higher for more severe cases and/or if test sensitivity is higher for more severe cases. The magnitude of this bias may be uncertain for a long period because the spectrum of clinical presentations is itself uncertain at the start of an outbreak of a new disease [12,26]. All proposed approaches to estimate and correct for this bias (Table 1) require auxiliary data sources to estimate how the reported subset of cases compares with the overall population of cases. The availability of such auxiliary data sources will depend on the context of the outbreak.",

Therefore, at any moment in time, the list of cases includes people who will die and whose death has not yet occurred, or has occurred but not yet been reported. Thus dividing the cumulative number of reported deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases at any moment will underestimate the true CFR. The key determinants of the magnitude of the bias are the epidemic growth rate and the distribution of delays from case-reporting to death-reporting; the longer the delays and the faster the growth rate, the greater the bias. Heuristically, the underestimate will be proportionate to the expansion of the epidemic during the delay between the time a case enters the database to the time the death of that case enters the database (if it occurs). Fig 1 illustrates an example where the delay is 3 weeks, the epidemic doubling time is 2 weeks, and the underestimate is by a factor of 23/2 \u2248 2.8.",

A simple approach is to limit analysis to those cases with sufficiently long follow-up for a death to have been recorded had a death occurred, but this approach may result in an exceedingly small sample size if applied early in the epidemic.

If not different, the estimates of the causal effect of hospitalization for several values of d could be combined.

As a common cause of the exposure of interest (hospitalization) and the outcome (death), disease severity is a confounder of the causal effect of hospitalization on death. If hospitalization is offered to especially severe cases or\u2014in the setting of extreme triage\u2014to especially mild cases, then hospitalization would spuriously appear harmful (if hospitalization went to especially severe cases) or beneficial (if it went to especially mild cases). There may be other confounders of this effect besides disease severity. Individuals living in rural areas may be at greater risk of mortality (e.g., due to malnutrition) and also less likely to be hospitalized (due to longer travel time to hospital). Place of residence (or travel time to hospital) in this setting would be a confounder of the effect of hospitalization on death. The standard approach to reducing confounding is to stratify, restrict, or adjust for prognostic factors that affect the propensity to receive the treatment (in this case to be hospitalized) [27].

One strategy that would help to resolve the other two sources of bias is to limit analysis to a cohort of cases who were identified before they became cases; for example those who were identified as healthy contacts of known cases, and were followed prospectively. Confounding occurs because individual factors like severity of infection or place of residence (which could affect both the probability of exposure\u2014receiving the intervention\u2014and the probability of the outcome\u2014mortality) are not accounted for in the analysis through stratification, restriction, or adjustment. Selection bias in this setting occurs because the exposure and the outcome both affect the probability of inclusion in the database. Follow-up of a cohort of contacts ascertained before becoming cases could eliminate hospitalization and mortality as predictors of inclusion in the database, thus eliminating the form of selection bias we have discussed. It would provide an opportunity for gathering data on severity and other predictors of exposure and outcome, which would facilitate control of confounding, though not guarantee to eliminate it. Such a cohort would also provide a natural setting for analyses that avoid survivorship bias. The cost of such improvements in inference would be the need to ascertain such contacts and maintain surveillance of those individuals, following them to obtain data on relevant covariates. Such a strategy\u2013which has been followed in cases of exposed health-care workers in settings with high resources and few cases\u2014would likely have benefits for the individuals followed (e.g., increasing the probability they receive care if infected) and for reducing transmission (if such individuals were promptly isolated upon evidence of infection). However, it has not been possible so far in the large Ebola outbreaks in West Africa to do this routinely.",

For example, in 2009, there was much interest in whether morbid obesity (or obesity in general) was predictive of worse outcome in infection with the novel pandemic strain of influenza A/H1N1 [34].The primary goal was to improve estimates of clinical prognosis, although observations about prognosis could later be used to generate causal hypotheses for further testing. Similarly, observations of disparate rates of severe outcomes by geography within New York City did not initially involve causal judgments about why certain areas had worse outcomes, although they could be used to guide enhancement of services in areas with worse outcomes [35]. Even for a well-understood disease like polio, it may be necessary to identify unusual demographic patterns of mortality in order to understand and respond effectively to an outbreak [36].",

They can, however, suffer from selection bias. Returning to the Ebola context, one might wish to know whether pregnant women infected with Ebola are at greater risk of death from Ebola infection than other cases [37], for example, in order to give them greater supportive care. If the probability of entering the database depends on whether an Ebola patient is pregnant and on whether she ultimately dies of the infection, then the probability of death given pregnancy will likely differ in the database from the value in the population of direct interest for a clinical or public health decision maker. If the goal of analysis is to inform public health decision makers on the value of efforts to prevent infection in pregnant women, then the population-wide CFR among pregnant women is the value of direct interest. If, on the other hand, the goal of analysis is to inform health care providers at a treatment center to make a better clinical decision based on an accurate prognosis of the patient presenting to them, the quantity of direct interest is the probability of death among pregnant women in the population they encounter\u2014those admitted to the treatment center. This value, again, will differ from that in the database, which may (in our running example) have been enriched for individuals entered in the database because they died of the infection. It will also differ from that in the overall population. The general point is that selection bias can be operative if the population on which analysis is performed is not a representative sample of the population for which the value of the CFR is sought, and selection bias of this form can lead to spurious conclusions in prognostic estimates as well as in causal ones. As in the case of causal inference, prognostic estimates will avoid selection bias to the extent they can be performed on a randomly chosen cohort of cases, identified via tracing of healthy contacts, for example.",

Moreover, treatment facilities might be evaluated by the proportion of their patients who survive; here the relative CFR calculated would be for treatment in one facility versus treatment in another. There will be a temptation to conclude that treatment facilities with higher CFR are doing a worse job\u2014that is, to apply a causal interpretation to observed differences in the CFR. Even in settings with more resources to measure covariates, methods of risk-adjustment of comparative outcomes to account for the mix of patients seen are complex and controversial [38]. In an emergency setting, with few covariates available to characterize the \u201ccase mix\u201d of a health care provider, causal interpretation of differences in CFR would be particularly prone to error, potentially producing conclusions that mislead and thereby damage control efforts. For instance, if through confounding, larger referral treatment centers primarily receive patients who have survived infection for some time and are therefore less likely to die, independently of treatment, this may be erroneously interpreted as more effective treatment in these centers. Similarly, if certain treatment centers preferentially admit the most symptomatic patients, they may falsely appear to be less effective or even harmful to patient outcome. With at least five separate sources of bias in CFR or relative CFR estimates, and only imperfect solutions typically available for most due to lack of data, separating causal from non-causal factors in relative CFR estimation seems extremely risky. This is not to deny that data should be gathered or analyzed; on the contrary, the biases here suggest that more thorough data gathering is necessary before analyses of such quantities as relative CFR are relied upon for any decision.",

Simple division of the number of deaths reported by week w (green), by the number of cases reported by week w (blue) will underestimate the CFR because the numerator does not include all those cases in the denominator who will eventually die. With a reporting delay of 3 weeks for deaths compared to cases, the reported deaths curve will be shifted 3 weeks to the right, relative to the curve of the total number of cases reported by week w who will die (red). If the epidemic doubling time is 2 weeks, as shown here, the underestimate of CFR will be by a factor of about 23/2 \u2248 2.8, with the exponent being the number of epidemic doubling times that pass between case reporting and death reporting. In reality, there will be a distribution of reporting delays rather than a fixed delay, making this a heuristic rather than exact approach.
