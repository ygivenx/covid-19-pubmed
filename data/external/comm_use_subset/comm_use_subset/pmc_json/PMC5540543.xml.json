New medicinal agents are also needed for nematode infections such as malaria and for the treatment of parasitic protozoan diseases such as leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis [2].",

Such sources may include various forms of life like plants, marine macro-organisms (sponge, corals and algae) and endophytes (fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes) [3]. Plants which are used in traditional medicines are of significant importance and therefore considerable research has been carried out on medicinal plants for bioactive compounds however limited research has been performed on the associated microorganisms. Endophytes are chemical synthesizer inside plants. They play a role as a selection system for microbes to produce pharmacologically active substances with low toxicity toward mammalians [4]. Endophytes are sometimes responsible for the medicinal properties of their hosts. Many endophytes synthesize bioactive compounds that can be used by plants for defense against pathogens and some of these compounds may be valuable as pharmaceutical drugs [5].",

Bacterial strains were inoculated in 10 mL TSB and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C at 120 rpm in shaking incubator. For each bacterial strain, a standardized inoculum (1 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL) was prepared. The test samples were used in three fold dilutions i.e. 100, 33.3, 11.1 and 3.7 \u00b5g/mL. DMSO was used as negative control and cefixime monohydrate (antibiotic) as positive control, respectively. Reading was initially taken at zero hours and then again after 24 h incubation through microplate reader (ELx800BioTek) at 630 nm wave length [20]. The corresponding 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each sample was calculated.",
