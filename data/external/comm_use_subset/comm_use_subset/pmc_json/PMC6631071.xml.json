The ISR facilitates cellular survival and a return to homeostasis, or initiates cell death signaling under conditions of severe stress or when the initiating stressor is maintained [4]. Four distinct stress kinases can be activated in response to stress. Although these kinases may have a number of substrates, they all phosphorylate the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) at serine position 51. When eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated, the GTP-exchange factor, eIF2B is unable to exchange GDP for GTP on eIF2. As a consequence eIF2B becomes sequestered and its effective levels drop, preventing efficient formation of the eIF2.GTP.Met-tRNAi ternary complex and thus inhibiting translation initiation [4]. ",

To do this, viruses target the initiating kinases and/or the downstream effector mechanisms of the ISR. Cells in which the initiating kinases, such as PKR, are inhibited or knocked out are often more permissive for viral replication [12,13]. However, not all viruses benefit from inhibition of kinase activity and initiation of the ISR. A study examining the role of the PKR-eIF2 pathway during Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) infection found some strains had reduced titers in PKR knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [14]. Follow-up studies observed both increased ISR gene expression and reduced levels of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase inhibitor, P58IPK, in cells infected with reovirus strains known to robustly interfere with host translation, and these strains replicated less efficiently in MEFs expressing a non-phosphorylatable form of eIF2\u03b1 [15].

            "text": "Reovirus infection also modulates SG formation that occurs downstream of ISR activation [15,16]. Early in infection, entering viral core particles localize to SGs that form within infected cells. However, within 4 to 6 h after infection, the SGs have disappeared and viral factories (VFs), the sites of reovirus replication, translation, and assembly, become prominent [16,17,18,19]. In some reovirus-infected cells, the SG protein, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1), localizes to the margins of the VFs, mediated by an interaction of G3BP1 with the non-structural viral protein, \u03c3NS [20]. \u03c3NS also interacts with the nonstructural protein, \u03bcNS, that forms the matrix of VFs, and co-expression of \u03c3NS and \u03bcNS is sufficient to alter the localization of G3BP1 and suppress SG induction [20,21]. The interplay between eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, PKR activation, translational shutoff, and G3BP1-induced SG formation is strain-dependent, as SG formation negatively impacts the replication of some strains of reovirus [20]. Together, these studies suggest a unique role for the ISR during reovirus infection. Given the previous observation that reovirus replicates to lower titers in cells with an impaired ISR, we hypothesized that reovirus infection would be enhanced in cells in which the ISR has been activated prior to infection. To test this, we utilized the chemical sodium arsenite (SA). When applied to cells, SA leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. In response to increased ROS levels, the HRI kinase phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 and induces SG formation, ultimately leading to translation inhibition [22]. We found that when we activated the ISR by pre-treating cells with SA prior to virus adsorption, reovirus infection was more efficient (increased permissivity, protein expression, and replication). SA-induced enhancement of reovirus infection was observed in all reovirus strains tested but was dependent on cell-type and the time of SA addition. Enhancement of viral infectivity was only observed if SA was added to cells within 4 h of inoculation, with maximal enhancement if the addition occurred prior to inoculation, suggesting a relationship between the ISR and early replication events. Furthermore, not all activators of the ISR were equally beneficial as heat shock (HS) prior to infection had no impact on viral replication. Taken together, these data suggest a critical role for the ISR during reovirus infection and that activation of the ISR with SA prior to reovirus infection is beneficial in some cell types. This study expands upon the previous observation that reovirus replicates to reduced titers in cells lacking a phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 and helps to clarify uncertainty in the field as to the timing of SG induction by reovirus. Reovirus is an oncolytic virus, preferentially infecting and lysing cancer cells. Insight into how reovirus infection activates the stress response, and how these responses can be modulated to enhance infection, could help to maximize the oncolytic potential of this virus.",

We observed SGs in ~91% of the treated CV-1 cells, confirming that these cells can form SGs (Figure 1A, top row and Figure S1). We next evaluated the capacity of reovirus to induce SG formation in the absence of SA. To do this, we infected CV-1 cells with reovirus T3D at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and, at the indicated times post-infection (p.i.), fixed and co-immunostained cells for the presence of SGs (TIAR) and VFs (\u03bcNS) (Figure 1A, lower panels and Figure S1). SGs were absent in mock-infected cells and began appearing in wells infected with T3D around 2 h p.i. We found that SG formation in reovirus-infected wells peaked around 6 h p.i. with 6.6% of total cells containing SGs. By 8 h p.i., the percentage of cells containing SGs had dropped to 3.1% and by 18 h p.i., the percentage of cells containing SGs was no different from mock-infected cells (Figure 1A,B and Figure S1). A previous report detected SGs in reovirus-infected human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells at 19.5 h post infection [15]. We were unable to detect SGs in reovirus infected cells at late times post infection at a variety of MOIs (Figure 1A (bottom row) and Figure 1C (middle row). However, G3BP did localize to the periphery of VFs in some infected cells at 24 h p.i. (Figure 1C, middle row). This was not seen at 8 h p.i. (Figure 1C, top row). Furthermore, if we treated infected cells with SA at 23.5 h p.i. immediately before harvest as others have done, G3BP could be observed in punctae at the periphery of VFs in some infected cells (Figure 1C) [15,20]. These findings are in agreement with those of Choudhury et al., who found that G3BP localizes to the VF periphery during reovirus infection [20]. To determine if reovirus altered the expression levels of SG proteins, we next evaluated G3BP and TIAR protein expression during infection (Figure 1D). While G3BP levels remained relatively constant over the course of infection, we did note an increase in TIAR expression at 18 h p.i. by immunoblot that was independent of MOI. Additionally, the increase in TIAR expression at 18 h was evident for both mock and reovirus-infected cells (Figure 1D). This finding is in contrast to the immunofluorescence data presented in Figure 1A, where no changes in overall TIAR expression were noted. However, we did observe that the localization of TIAR shifted over time, with TIAR expression primarily localized to the nucleus at early times post infection, but primarily found in the cytoplasm at late times post infection (Figure S1). Together, these data suggest that reovirus infection induces SGs at early, but not late times post-infection in CV-1 cells.",

            "text": "Following infection with reovirus, the viral protein, \u03bcNS, orchestrates the formation of VFs, the sites of virus replication, assembly, and translation [17,18,19]. Cellular factors involved in translation, such as eIF3, eIF4G, and ribosomal subunits, are recruited to VFs and many of these initiation factors are similarly compartmentalized within SGs [19,27]. To date, most studies have focused on the induction of SGs in response to viral infection, or viral suppression of SG formation during an infection. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to assess the impact of the presence of SGs on the initiation of reovirus infection. To explore this, we first examined the effect of SG presence on viral protein expression. CV-1 cells were infected with T3D at an MOI = 1 and were either pre-treated by adding 0.5 mM SA for 30 min before the start of infection (pre) or post-treated by adding SA for the 30 min immediately before harvest (post). Cell lysates were collected at 0, 2, 6, 10, 18, and 24 h p.i. and the expression level of the non-structural viral protein, \u03bcNS, was determined (\u03bcNS was first detectable by 10 h p.i.). At 10, 18, and 24 h p.i., the expression levels of \u03bcNS were consistently higher in cells pre-treated with SA when compared to untreated cells or cells treated with SA 30 min before harvest (Figure 2A). Consistent with Figure 1D, G3BP expression levels remained relatively constant throughout the course of infection, and in response to the various treatments (Figure 2A). ",

To further assess the functional consequences of SA pre-treatment on reovirus replication, we performed a one-step growth curve in CV-1 cells infected with reovirus at an MOI = 1. While there was no difference between the two groups at early times following infection (6 h), the viral titer was consistently higher in cells pre-treated with SA at late times post infection (Figure 2E).

Therefore, we next sought to determine if the replication enhancement observed in CV-1 cells was seen in other cell types. To do this, we selected three additional cell types to represent a variety of species and tissue types to complement our studies performed in CV-1 African green monkey kidney cells. These included L929 murine fibroblasts, a cell line commonly used to grow reovirus; HeLa cells, an immortal human cervical epithelial cell line; and HPDE cells, a non-cancerous human pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line. We first evaluated whether SGs could form in each of these cell types. Treatment with 0.5 mM SA for 30 min induced strong SG formation in each line (Figure S2A). Next, we assessed the effect of pre-treatment with 0.5 mM SA on viral permissivity in each cell type. Since each cell line differed in its permissivity to reovirus, we performed immunofluorescence using antibodies against \u03bcNS to determine the concentration of virus required to give rise to 20% to 50% of the cells being infected. We chose 20% to 50% to ensure that any positive or negative effects of SA treatment were captured. Consistent with our observations in CV-1 cells, pre-treatment with SA in L929 and HPDE cells resulted in a higher percentage of cells exhibiting VFs than in untreated cells (Figure 3A). In HeLa cells, however, the percent of infected cells was comparable in both untreated and SA pre-treated cells (Figure 3A). To further assess the static permissivity in HeLa cells, viral protein expression was compared in HeLa, L929, and CV-1 cells. For this, we determined the expression levels of \u03bcNS and the reovirus outer capsid protein, \u03bc1, in the presence or absence of SA pre-treatment [29]. Cells were pre-treated with SA for 30 min prior to infection with T3D at an MOI = 1, and at 18 h p.i., cells were harvested and the expression level of the indicated proteins was determined by immunoblot. Consistent with Figure 3A, at 18 h p.i., the expression level of \u03bcNS and \u03bc1 was increased in CV-1 and L929 cells pre-treated with SA, but was unchanged in HeLa cells (Figure 3B,C). The difference observed between HeLa and CV-1 or L929 cells was not a result of a failure to induce SGs or phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1. Indeed, both of these outcomes occurred in HeLa cells in response to SA treatment (Figure S2A,B). These data indicate that activation of the stress response pathways prior to infection through pre-treatment with SA is beneficial in some cell types.",

To determine if the benefit of pre-treatment with SA was reovirus strain specific, we infected CV-1 cells with T3D, T1L, or T3A and assessed the percentage of infected cells at 18 h p.i. compared to untreated cells. As observed following infection with the T3D strain, pre-treatment with SA resulted in nearly a 2-fold increase in the percentage of T1L- and T3A-infected CV-1 cells (Figure 3D). SA pre-treatment in L929 cells infected with T3D, T1L, or T3A yielded similar results, however, SA pre-treatment had no effect on any strain tested in HeLa cells (Figure 3E,F). These data suggest that the reovirus strains, T3D, T1L, and T3A, benefit from pre-treatment with SA prior to infection in some cell types.",

            "text": "Cellular treatment with SA produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can accumulate, resulting in oxidative stress and activation of the HRI kinase [7,22,31]. The HRI kinase is activated in erythrocytes by reduced heme availability, but it is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and, when activated by SA, phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 and subsequently induces SG formation [22]. HRI is the only stress kinase required for translational inhibition in response to arsenite treatment in mouse embryonic fibroblasts [22]. HRI kinase can also be activated by other cellular stresses, including osmotic stress and heat shock (HS) [7]. To further assess if the enhanced reovirus infectivity following SA treatment was specific to SA, we assessed viral protein expression, the percentage of infected cells, and the viral yield in response to HS. We used SG induction in response to HS as an indirect measure of HRI activation as we were unable to detect kinase expression by immunoblot using a commercial antibody (Figure 4A). Despite many attempts, we were unsuccessful at inducing SGs in more than 25% of CV-1 cells with HS. We also noted that HS failed to induce phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 above levels found in untreated CV-1 cells (Figure S2B). However, we were readily able to induce SGs in L929 cells using HS. HS for 45 min at 44 \u00b0C resulted in ~88% of L929 cells containing SGs and an increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation compared to untreated cells (Figure 4A and Figure S2B). Because of this, we assessed the effects of HS induction of the ISR in L929 cells. Similar to our observations in CV-1 cells pre-treated with SA, viral protein expression was enhanced at 10 and 18 h p.i. in L929 cells exposed to a 45 min HS prior to infection (Figure 4B). However, HS had no impact on the percentage of infected cells or the viral yield in L929 cells (Figure 4C\u2013E). These findings suggest that in L929 cells, HS enhances protein expression but does not affect either the numbers of infected cells or the per cell yield of the virus. Although HS has previously been shown to activate the HRI kinase, its effect on cells differs from SA [7]. Together, these data indicate that SA pre-treatment perturbs the cell in a way that is beneficial for reovirus compared to other activators of the ISR.",

Consistent with our previous data, pre-treatment with SA prior to inoculation with virus resulted in an increase in the percentage of infected cells (Figure 5A,B). Additionally, untreated cells infected and then treated with SA for 30 min also demonstrated increased permissivity, if the addition of SA occurred within the first 4 h after infection (Figure 5A,B).

In response to the accumulation of p-eIF2\u03b1, part of the ISR includes expression of growth arrest and DNA damage protein-34 (GADD34). GADD34 is a protein phosphatase-interacting protein that, in conjunction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), acts to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 at serine 51 during times of cellular stress [34]. It was previously shown that GADD34 is upregulated in cells following infection with reovirus strains that induce host shut-off [15]. Our findings thus far are consistent with previous reports suggesting that eIF2\u03b1 kinase activation is beneficial to reovirus infection [15]. We, therefore hypothesized that reovirus may be capable of viral protein synthesis in the face of enhanced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. We reasoned that inhibition of GADD34/PPI dephosphorylation would enhance phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, but should have no effect on viral protein synthesis. We used a selective inhibitor of GADD34, salubrinal, which prevents the activity of the GADD34/PPI complex without affecting the kinases that phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 [35]. To confirm that salubrinal inhibited eIF2\u03b1 de-phosphorylation as expected, cells were either incubated in the presence or absence of 50 \u03bcM salubrinal for 17.5 h before treating with 0.5 mM SA for 30 min. Two hours following the removal of SA, cells were lysed and immunoblots were performed for the indicated proteins. As expected, treatment with SA resulted in an increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation compared to untreated cells (Figure 6A). The expression level of p-eIF2\u03b1 was enhanced even further when cells were incubated with salubrinal prior to SA treatment (Figure 6A). Next, we determined the impact of sustained eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation on reovirus protein expression. Immediately following adsorption of reovirus, CV-1 cells were treated with increasing amounts of salubrinal and cells were harvested at 18 h p.i. to determine viral protein expression (Figure 6B). Even at high concentrations, salubrinal had no impact on viral protein expression, suggesting that reovirus tolerates the cellular antiviral activity of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Given that SA is a known inducer of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, we also tested the impact of adding salubrinal following reovirus adsorption to SA pre-treated cells (Figure 6B).",

SA treatment induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells. The increased intracellular ROS in turn lead to the activation of HRI, which then phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 at serine residues 48 and 51, leading to general translation repression and downstream activation of the ISR. In order to mature and become activated, HRI has to be in a complex with CDC37, PPP5C, and HSP90. In addition to being activated by heme-deficiency, HRI is also activated by HS and osmotic shock, but not by ER stress or by amino acid or serum starvation [7]. In contrast to the enhanced viral replication we saw following pre-treatment with SA, HS pre-treatment did not enhance viral replication. HS also activates HRI, but to a qualitatively lower level than SA and with a different pattern of autophosphorylation of HRI [7]. Why pre-stressing cells with SA, but not with HS, benefited viral replication is unclear. It is possible that the kinetics, magnitude, and timing of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation following these different stressors varied, leading to the different outcomes we saw. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that SA treatment activates responses not mediated by the ISR that benefit viral replication. ",

Consistent with the findings of Qin et al., we found that reovirus infection induced SG formation early after infection with the number of SG-containing cells reducing by 8 h and disappearing late in infection. Our data in CV-1 cells are not consistent with the report by Smith et al., who detected SGs at 19.5 h post-infection of DU145 cells [15,16]. While it is likely that different strains of reovirus induce SGs to varying extents, and that this is influenced by cell type and MOI, our data using the T3D strain suggests that infection with this strain of reovirus results in a low level of SG induction that is absent at late times post infection. The timing of SG appearance (peak at 6 h) and dissolution (beginning at 8 h) in our hands supports the idea put forth by Qin et al. that SG induction is linked to VF formation and that the onset of viral translation interferes with SG stability [16]. Smith et al. stained reovirus-infected cells at 19.5 h post-infection for the SG protein, TIAR, but did not co-stain for a viral protein, such as \u00b5NS, to detect VFs. We and others have observed that the SG protein, G3BP1, localizes to the outer margins of VFs at late times post infection in a fraction of reovirus infected cells [20]. Therefore, the TIAR-positive punctae seen at 19.5 h post infection by Smith may in fact have been VFs that were co-staining for the presence of TIAR [15]. The significance of SG protein relocalization to VFs remains to be determined. Still, these data imply that reovirus has evolved mechanisms to counter the cellular antiviral activity of translation suppression through SG induction. ",

Confounding this further, we observed an increase in TIAR expression in untreated cells harvested at 18 h compared to 2 h. Previous reports have indicated that during times of stress, SG protein levels remain constant but that their localization shifts [36,37,38]. TIAR is an RNA-binding protein that is found primarily in the nucleus of cycling cells and is involved in controlling mitotic entry but is capable of shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [39]. In response to stress, Fas-induced apoptosis, and transcriptional blockade, TIAR will accumulate in the cytoplasm [10,40,41]. Movement of TIAR from the nucleus has also been observed during herpes simplex virus 1 infection, with cytoplasmic accumulation beginning as early as 6 h after infection. In that study, a comparison of SG protein expression levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm revealed that although the cytosolic expression levels increased, total cellular protein levels were constant [42]. From this, we attribute the increase in TIAR expression at late times post infection to primarily be a result of the movement of TIAR into the cytoplasm. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the increased cytoplasmic expression is a result of viral infection, a similar pattern was detected in uninfected cells, suggesting this is more likely a result of transcriptional blockade associated with contact inhibition.

            "text": "Our data is consistent with the findings of Smith et al. that reovirus benefits from activation of the ISR. In that study, the authors found that reovirus replicated to lower titers in cells lacking a phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 [15]. SA is a potent activator of the ISR. SA-mediated activation of the HRI kinase leads to phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and downstream upregulation of ATF4 and other transcriptional mediators of the ISR [22]. Given that canonical cap-dependent cellular translation relies on the availability of active GTP.eIF2, it is possible that activation of the ISR allows reovirus mRNAs a competitive advantage for limited translational machinery. The effect of SA was greatest when added before reovirus adsorption but was still beneficial if treatment occurred within the first 4 h of infection. Translation of reovirus mRNAs rises sharply at ~ 6 h p.i. and peaks at ~12 h p.i. [33]. Given that the rising level of viral protein synthesis is concomitant with continued host protein synthesis, it is possible that SA treatment selectively reduces the translational machinery available for host protein synthesis [33]. It has been postulated that heightened eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation may more strongly affect mRNAs containing long or highly structured 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) [31,43]. Reovirus mRNAs have short 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, possibly providing protection to viral mRNAs during translation [44,45]. Our findings that reovirus protein expression and infectivity were unaffected when we treated cells with salubrinal to prevent de-phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 further supports this and suggests that reovirus is refractory to salubrinal exposure.

            "text": "We cannot exclude the possibility that pre-treatment of cells with SA has other effects that promote viral replication independently of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Reovirus is an oncolytic virus, preferentially infecting cancer cells. This phenomenon has been linked to a mutationally-active Ras pathway, however, reports have been conflicting regarding Ras dependency [46,47,48,49,50]. Cancer cells have elevated levels of chaperones that facilitate the high levels of protein synthesis typical of transformed cells. The efficiency of mRNA translation is increased in the presence of supplemental recombinant Hsc70 and the rate of translation elongation may be regulated by chaperone availability [51]. Treatment with SA also increases Hsc70/Hsp70 chaperone levels in cells [52]. Furthermore, Hsc70 is required for HRI activation and blockade of Hsc70 disrupts HRI activation [7]. We have previously reported that Hsc70 is specifically targeted to the VF, the site of reovirus translation, although why this protein is specifically recruited remains unclear as its recruitment is independent of its chaperone function [19,53]. Alternatively, SA pre-treatment might alter the availability of Hsc70 or other protein folding chaperones in a way that is favorable during the early stages of reovirus replication. Hsc70 was previously shown to promote release of the \u03b4 fragment from the reovirus outer capsid protein \u03bc1, completing disassembly of the outer capsid and deposition of a transcriptionally active core particle in the cytosol [54]. In that study, \u03b4 fragment release was nearly abolished in rabbit reticulocyte lysates immunodepleted of Hsc70 and Hsp70, but could be restored by the addition of purified Hsc70, suggesting a role for Hsc70 in virus uncoating [54].",

We observed that type 3 Dearing (T3D) reovirus protein expression was unaffected in the presence of salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of the GADD34/PP1\u03b1 complex responsible for dephosphorylating eIF2\u03b1, even in cells pre-treated with SA to elevate the level of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1. The observation that salubrinal was not anti-viral to T3D reovirus is not unique. Rotavirus, a fellow member of the Reoviridae family, as well as other viruses, including hepatitis C virus and mouse hepatitis coronavirus, demonstrate continued viral protein synthesis despite heightened eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [55,56,57]. While this provides additional evidence that reovirus benefits from the ISR, it is important to note that reovirus-induced expression of stress response genes is not uniform and that host shutoff strains, including C8 and C87 (type 3 Abney, T3A), induce increased expression of these genes compared to T3D, which is not considered a host shutoff strain. While all reovirus strains tested, including T3A, benefited from SA pre-treatment, host shutoff strains may respond differently from T3D to salubrinal treatment [15].",
