As a novel coronavirus, PDCoV can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting, with high mortality in piglets, which can lead to serious economic loss in the swine industry [1,2,3]. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that are classified into four genera including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Deltacoronavirus. CoVs are prone to interspecies transmission [4]. In particular, Betacoronaviruses include SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which can cause lethal respiratory infections in humans and are notable examples of interspecies transmission [5,6]. Cross-species transmission, facilitated by the widespread prevalence of CoV in mammals and birds, and genetic diversity, driven by high mutation rates and high frequency of recombination, increase the chance of successful adaptation to a new host [7].",

            "text": "PDCoV, belonging to the genus Deltacoronavirus and the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales, is a recently discovered CoV of unknown origin, which has a wide host range, including wild birds, swine, and other mammals [8,9]. The PDCoV genome is approximately 25 kb and has seven open reading frames, i.e., open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), NS6, and NS7. As an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus, PDCoV has strong pathogenicity and can cause watery diarrhea, vomiting, and high mortality in piglets, posing a potential threat to the swine husbandry. The post-infection mortality of suckling piglets can reach 30% to 40%, causing serious economic losses to the pork industry [10]. PDCoV efficiently infects cells of several species, including swine, human, and chicken. Ectopic expression of porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) rendered non-susceptible cells susceptible to PDCoV infection and greatly enhance PDCoV infection in HeLa cells [11]. This suggests that PDCoV has the potential to spread between species and may be a threat to humans, as closely related viruses have led to outbreaks of deadly diseases such as SARS and MERS [12,13]. PDCoV global distribution in swine and its potential for transmission to multiple hosts are alarming. Pigs are the second largest livestock species and act as intermediate hosts for multiple zoonotic transmissions, emphasizing the need for studying the zoonotic potential of PDCoV and the development of antiviral drugs [14].",

            "text": "Given the lack of specific antiviral therapies to control PDCoV infection, searching for effective small-molecule inhibitors active against PDCoV is a high research priority. Antiviral reagents include directly acting antivirals (DAAs), which can directly act on viral components (proteins or genomes), and host-acting antivirals (HAAs), which can act on hosts [15,16,17]. Although DAAs are more virus-specific, viruses quickly develop resistance [18]. Antiviral methods based on host cellular mechanisms have potential advantages in reducing virus drug resistance and dealing with viral emergencies. Therefore, the search and development of HAAs has aroused more and more interest. An interesting feature of HAAs is their broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which allows for immediate treatment without a lead time being required to develop a specific therapy [19]. With the emergence of new viruses threatening human health, the discovery of new functions in existing clinical drugs is often used in the screening of modern emergency therapies. Traditional broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have shown antiviral activity against many types of viruses [17]. For example, ribavirin has antiviral activity against Hantavirus [20], H1N1 influenza virus [21], Dengue virus [22], and Chikungunya virus [23]. Therefore, the discovery of new antiviral functions for existing clinical drugs is still an important strategy against PDCoV infection. ",

            "text": "Here, the antiviral activities of LiCl and DG, which are both HAAs, were studied against PDCoV. LiCl can inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses, including Herpesvirus type 1 (HSV-1) [24], transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [25], porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [26], pseudorabies virus (PRV) [27], and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [28]. LiCl can also regulate apoptosis and promote resumption of the synthesis of host proteins in infected cells [25,26]. Recent studies showed that LiCl could effectively inhibit the entry and replication of PEDV in Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner [28]. In addition, LiCl can inhibit early and late apoptosis induced by PEDV. PDCoV and PEDV belong to the family Coronaviridae and have similar genomic structure. However, antiviral drugs against PDCoV have not been researched. Therefore, we explored whether LiCl could inhibit infection by PDCoV. The licorice extract isolated from the rhizome of Glycyrrhiza uralensis has a strong antiviral activity [29]. In recent years, licorice extracts have been shown to have antiviral effects on many viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [30], hepatitis B virus (HBV) [31], hepatitis A virus (HAV) [32], SARS-CoV [33], infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [34], PRRSV [29], and PRV [27]. According to previous studies, DG pre-treatement inhibited PRV infection in a dose-dependent manner and reduced apoptosis [27]. Glycyrrhizin and DG have antiviral effect against SARS-CoV and IBV. Additionally, the water solubility of DG is better than that of glycyrrhizin, so we chose to verify the effect of DG on PDCoV. ",

In all experiments, the cells were infected with PDCoV [ multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.05], and 60 mM LiCl or 1250 \u03bcg/mL DG was added. The viral contents were significantly reduced in cells treated with LiCl at 0 to 16 h, but no significant reduction was detected after 16 h (Figure 6B). For DG, the latest effective time point of drug treatment was 12 hpi (Figure 6C). Therefore, we can conclude that the antiviral effects of LiCl and DG occur at the early stages of PDCoV replication.

Until now, there are no records of clinically effective agents for the treatment of PDCoV infection, and no compound has shown antiviral activity [35]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a good approach for preventing PDCoV infection. Because neither specific antiviral drugs nor vaccines are available for newly emerging viruses and it is not possible to develop small-molecule drugs and vaccines that act on PDCoV in a short period of time, the novel use of traditional drugs has long been considered to be an important means of finding new therapies targeting new infectious diseases [36]. It has been reported that LiCl and DG, which are often deemed broad-spectrum antiviral reagents, have antiviral properties against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, IBV, and PEDV. However, it remains unknown whether LiCl or DG has an inhibitory effect on PDCoV infection.",

We found that LiCl and DG inhibited the replication of PDCoV in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

However, the specific mechanism needs further investigation. Future experiments will determine if DG can be used not only as a treatment but also for preventing PDCoV infection. Because DG has a good water solubility, it can be used as aerosol disinfectant in piggeries to prevent the outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea. According to the antiviral effect, the antiviral activity of LiCl is better than that of DG, and the toxicity of DG is less than that of LiCl. We investigated the effect of LiCl combined with DG on the replication of PDCoV in LLC-PK1 cells. There were no significant differences between LiCl-treated cells and cells treated with LiCl and DG in the mean relative viral mRNA levels, indicating that there is no synergy in the inhibition of viral replication when both drugs are used in combination (data not shown).",

This can be fundamental for viral pathogenesis and disease development to promote cell death and tissue injury.
