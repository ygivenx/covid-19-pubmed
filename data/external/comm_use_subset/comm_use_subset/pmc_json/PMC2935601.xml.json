Such \u2018species jumps\u2019 have been proposed as a major source of novel pathogen introductions (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Kuiken et al. 2006), and indeed many emerging human diseases are zoonotic (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001). Typically, these pathogens are initially poorly adapted to humans because of physiological differences between species (Kuiken et al. 2006). Thus, significant spread of these pathogens within the human population often requires evolutionary adaptation (Dennehy 2009).",

These include the breadth of the pathogen's host range (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007), susceptibility of the host (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007), contact patterns in the host population (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Kuiken et al. 2006; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007; Dennehy 2009), the mechanism(s) of pathogen adaptation (e.g. whether recombination is possible; Woolhouse et al. 2005), pathogen taxonomic classification (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001), pathogen generation time (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001) or growth rate (Dennehy 2009) and pathogen mutability (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005; Dennehy 2009). Indeed, empirical studies have revealed that some of these factors are often associated with emerging diseases (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007). In particular, viruses and protozoa display a relatively high propensity for being involved in newly emerging human diseases (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Taylor et al. 2001), and the degree of transmissibility between members of the new host species also appears to be a risk factor where data are available (Taylor et al. 2001).",

Any factor that increases the expected number of transmitted infections, such as higher initial transmissibility between members of the new host species, means that the pathogen can circulate for longer after the cross-species jump, and thus has greater potential for ultimate evolutionary adaptation (Antia et al. 2003). For the same reason, patterns of contact among hosts should also play an important role in disease emergence, because some contact structures ought to lead to greater scope for transmission than others. To date, however, the most \u2018risky\u2019 patterns of host contact are not known.",

It has been suggested that the high incidence of emergence among viruses may be attributed, at least partially, to their high mutation rates (particularly in RNA viruses). A high mutation rate might lead to a greater likelihood of the appropriate adaptive mutations occurring, implying greater evolutionary potential (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005). On the other hand, most mutations are deleterious, and a high mutation rate could thereby increase the chance of pathogen extinction (Dennehy 2009). Indeed, this propensity for extinction might be exploited clinically by drug-induced \u2018lethal mutagenesis\u2019 (Anderson et al. 2004; Clementi 2008). Thus, it remains unclear whether higher mutation rates do indeed lead to a higher likelihood of evolutionary emergence, or whether other processes are required to explain the empirical patterns.",

We ask two main questions: (i) what types of host contact structure lead to the greatest risk of evolutionary emergence? and (ii) how do patterns of mutation affect the risk of evolutionary emergence? We address these questions using a branching process model that tracks the number of infected hosts as a newly introduced pathogen spreads and evolves. There have been two main approaches to using such models in the epidemiological literature, a network-based approach and a phenomenological approach. The former explicitly considers the patterns of contact among individuals in the population and the probability of transmission through any given contact (e.g. Brauer 2008), but has not, to date, allowed for evolution. The latter assumes that the population is well mixed and in some cases allows for evolution, but has not explicitly modelled the contact patterns among individuals (e.g. Antia et al. 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Day et al. 2006; Yates et al. 2006; Reluga et al. 2007). In order to address the above questions, we place these two approaches within a common framework, generalizing to allow for arbitrary contact patterns and arbitrary pathways of evolutionary adaptation.",

Rather, it directly specifies a distribution of number of new infections, X, produced by an infected individual. The approach typically uses a Poisson distribution of infections, implicitly assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, but sometimes incorporates individual heterogeneity by allowing the mean of the distribution itself to be a random variable. For example, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) generally draw the mean, \u03bd, from a Gamma distribution with mean R0 and dispersion parameter \u03b2; then X has a negative binomial distribution with mean R0 and dispersion \u03b2. As special cases, \u03b2 = 1 corresponds to \u03bd \u223c Exp(R0) and X \u223c Geometric(R0), while \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e corresponds to \u03bd = R0 (no individual variation) and X \u223c Poisson(R0). In any case, the key difference from the network-based approach is that \u0393(s) is effectively specified directly. As before, one then defines the basic reproductive number as R0 = \u0393\u2032(1). Notice, however, that unlike the network-based approach, no distinction is made here between generation 0 infectives (i.e. those who receive the infection from an outside source) and later-generation infectives. (In special cases of the network model, all generations are in fact equivalent; see appendix A.2.) If we consider only later-generation infectives, the phenomenological approach can be obtained via the network-based approach, provided that the contact distribution in the latter is chosen to obtain the same end result for the offspring distribution (appendix A.3).",

An individual's type i (i = 1, \u2026 , m) denotes which one of the m possible pathogen strains is infecting that host. We allow for arbitrary contact distribution and assume that the contact network is determined by the host, independently of the pathogen strain. Thus, as before, degree is described by the PGF g(z) and the excess degree by G(z) for every individual, regardless of type. We retain the assumption that transmissions occur independently to each contact, and further assume that transmissibility T is strain-specific, denoted Ti for strain i. Thus, the probability of making an infectious contact depends only on the current infective's strain type. However, a different strain may be transmitted as a result of pathogen mutation. Specifically, given that a type i infective makes an infectious contact, strain j is transmitted with probability \u03bcij (\u2211j\n\u03bcij = 1, ). We call the m \u00d7 m matrix U = [\u03bcij] the \u2018mutation matrix\u2019, representing the mutational pathway(s) allowed in the evolution of the pathogen and their probabilities.",

Figure 2a shows how R0 increases with transmissibility T: in all cases, this increase is linear, but at a different rate for each contact distribution depending on the variance in contacts. Figure 2b plots the probability of emergence versus T for each contact distribution. This probability becomes non-zero at the point where R0 passes the critical value of one, which occurs at a different value of T for each distribution (as illustrated in figure 2a). Thus, at low values of T, the disease can persist in some host contact structures but not others, despite the fact that they all have the same mean number of contacts. As T increases, however, the probability of emergence increases at different rates for different contact structures, such that the ordering is not preserved. This observation is highlighted in the inset, showing emergence probability over an extended range of T. In contrast, the ordering is consistent in figure 2c, which plots the probability of emergence versus R0, comparable to Brauer's presentation (Brauer 2008). The same value of R0 has been achieved for each contact distribution by varying T to compensate. We can think of the middle plot as showing the net result of opposing influences illustrated in figure 2a,c. Similar considerations and results on the impact of contact distribution and transmissibility apply to the multiple strain case.",

In the case of irreversible mutation, we can number strains such that M is a triangular matrix, with its eigenvalues given simply by the entries on the main diagonal. Assuming the final strain is the best adapted, the dominant eigenvalue is then R0,m = G\u2032(1)Tm. Hence, criticality is independent of the precise details of a uni-directional mutation scheme. By contrast, a scheme that allows both forward and reverse mutation can affect criticality. Figure 3 illustrates how the population R0 (dominant eigenvalue of M) changes with the probability of reverse mutation (\u03bd) in the linear one-step reversible scheme; similar considerations apply to the hub-and-spoke one-step reversible scheme as well. A high rate of reverse mutation from a well-adapted to a poorly adapted strain can tip the branching process from supercritical to subcritical. Population R0 increases almost linearly with Tm, but is relatively insensitive to number of strains (m), earlier strain transmissibility (T1) and forward mutation probability (\u03bc). This is because population R0 is very close to amm = G\u2032(1)Tm(1 \u2212 \u03bd), but slightly influenced by contributions from small populations of other (poorly adapted) strains that persist asymptotically if the process escapes extinction.",

Here, Tm is far from the critical threshold, and reverse mutation, even at a high rate equal to that of forward mutation, makes a negligible impact on the probability of emergence. This agrees with Sagitov and Serra's result that reverse mutation is negligible in a similar model with an arbitrary offspring distribution (Sagitov & Serra 2009), and with the neglect of pathways to the escape mutant exceeding the minimum length in the work of Iwasa et al. (2003, 2004). On the other hand, results are highly sensitive to the path of forward mutation that is assumed to be possible. Allowing jumps directly to strain m tends to make a particularly large difference, with this effect most pronounced when early strains have very low transmissibility. Simultaneous point mutations, though extremely rare, also make a significant contribution to the probability of emergence. In general, similar trends were observed for larger Tm, with the probability of emergence scaled up but the relationships among mutation schemes the same. Probability of emergence reaches a plateau, presumably at the probability of the well-adapted strain m ever appearing, as Tm becomes very large (results not shown).",

Now that we have generalized the mutation scheme, we can investigate whether this effect is more pronounced for some schemes than for others. For instance, a decrease in intermediate strain transmissibility (creating a fitness valley) hurts the pathogen's chance of emergence more if only one-step forward mutation is possible, as opposed to a jump directly to the final strain through recombination (results not shown).

As an extreme case, we set transmissibility of all deleterious strains to be zero. Figure 8 plots the probability of emergence versus T1 for various mutation probabilities. When T1 is well below the critical threshold (at which R0,1 reaches 1), emergence probability increases linearly with mutation probability, as we would predict from analytical approximations (\u00a73.5). Although this figure plots results for m = 10 strains, a virtually identical increase in emergence probability versus \u03bc at fixed small T1 was observed for m = 2, 3, 5 as well (results not shown). This indicates that regardless of how high the risk of deleterious steps, a pathogen that is guaranteed to go extinct unless it acquires a beneficial mutation (evolves to strain m) is always better off having a large mutation rate. Near the critical threshold, emergence probability shows a sharp jump; once strain 1 is sufficiently fit to escape extinction without further evolution, mutation probability makes only a small difference in results. Shortly after this point, a very high mutation probability becomes detrimental to the pathogen, even while strain 1 is not as well adapted as strain m. The risk of mutating to a poorly adapted strain now outweighs the potential benefit of mutating to a better adapted strain. Adding reverse mutation at a probability equal to that of forward mutation makes negligible difference to quantitative results (results not shown), as also observed with linear mutation schemes where R0,m is not too close to one. We might suspect that increasing reverse mutation probability independently of forward mutation probability could provide a benefit to the pathogen if the transmissibility of deleterious strains is non-zero, such that mutation could \u2018rescue\u2019 the pathogen by a return to strain 1 (the hub). However, this does not appear to be the case within tested parameter ranges (results not shown): increasing reverse mutation probability decreases probability of emergence, though only marginally when R0,m is well above one.",

Here, we constrained all types of mutations to occur with proportional probabilities, based on some overall mutation rate of the pathogen. We found that, when the pathogen was initially poorly adapted, increasing overall mutation rate was usually beneficial to an emerging pathogen (i.e. riskier to the host). On the other hand, as the pathogen's initial fitness increases beyond the critical threshold where survival without adaptation is possible, the risk of deleterious mutations comes to outweigh the benefit of potential mutation to a more fit strain, and a high mutation rate becomes a liability (figure 8). Thus, our results largely provide support for the hypothesis that the statistically higher propensity of RNA viruses to emerge is due to their high mutation rate (Cleaveland et al. 2001; Woolhouse et al. 2005). However, an exception occurs with pathogens for which the fully adapted strain has a basic reproductive number only slightly above one. In this situation, when allowing for reverse mutation, we observed another phenomenon in which emergence probability has a non-monotonic relationship with overall mutation rate (figure 7). If this rate passes a critical point, excessive back mutation to poorly adapted strains implies that the pathogen can no longer sustain itself. This result parallels the phenomenon of \u2018error catastrophe\u2019 observed in viral quasi-species models, which offer a theoretical explanation for experimental success in inducing lethal mutagenesis in viruses (Eigen 2002; Anderson et al. 2004; Clementi 2008). Although the required \u2018mutation\u2019 rate may at first appear unrealistically high, it is important to remember that it does not represent the probability of point mutation during a single replication event, but actually incorporates all factors involved in strain conversion, including genetic changes arising during multiple rounds of replication and within-host strain competition. Taken together, our results suggest that any attempt to alter a pathogen's mutation rate for host benefit should be undertaken with careful consideration of the pathogen's initial fitness and the availability of mutations, both beneficial and deleterious. An attempt to induce lethal mutagenesis seems liable to backfire if the pathogen has significant adaptive potential, as in the case of many emerging pathogens.",

Given the importance of contact structure that we and others have predicted, consideration of more realistic networks may be an important next step. Using a branching process neglects higher order network features, such as loops that persist even in large populations, thus implicitly assuming that the availability of susceptibles is not limited by local saturation. Clustering of contacts is expected to limit disease spread owing to reduction in the availability of susceptibles (Keeling & Eames 2005), and including features such as triangles in networks may have a dramatic impact in decreasing the probability of a large-scale epidemic (Trapman 2007). Thus, we expect the branching process approach to provide an upper bound on the risk of emergence. On the other hand, a recent analysis addressing some apparent inconsistencies in the literature suggests that the impact of clustering on the probability of an epidemic is in fact negligible unless degree is typically small or host-based heterogeneities are large (Miller 2009), providing some support for conclusions drawn from a branching process approach. While some authors (e.g. Ball & Neal 2002; Trapman 2007; Miller 2009) have made progress in modelling stochastic single-strain disease spread with more complicated contact structures, to our knowledge such approaches have not yet been extended to multiple strains.",

That is, the same transmissibility applies to every host infected with a given strain of pathogen. However, host-based factors are predicted to play a role in emergence risk (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Woolhouse & Gaunt 2007), suggesting value in a more realistic model. This would incorporate variability in host characteristics contributing to transmissibility, such as infectivity and susceptibility (Yates et al. 2006; Miller 2007). Analysis in the single-strain case predicts that such heterogeneities reduce the probability of an epidemic (Miller 2007, 2009).",

We (and other authors) have implicitly assumed that any conversion of strains within an individual is instantaneous, with no possibility for co-infection. We have also ignored variation in the precise number of pathogen copies in the body. Realistically, once a mutation arises in a host there will be some dynamical process leading to fixation or loss over time, with coexistence of strains at least temporarily. Both Andr\u00e9 & Day (2005) and Handel et al.

In recent years, a number of authors have developed such \u2018nested models\u2019 (reviewed in Mideo et al. 2008); however, these are typically deterministic, whereas we suggest that stochasticity may be important at both levels. A pathogen may then increase its fitness via multiple routes (Antolin 2008), with potential for conflicting selection at different scales (Gilchrist & Coombs 2006; Coombs et al. 2007). We anticipate that antagonistic selection at the within- versus between-host scales would tend to reduce the probability of population-level emergence, as the more transmissible strain (better able to avoid extinction between hosts) is thwarted by dominance of other strain(s) within the host. By extending our model to the within-host scale, we can address these sorts of trade-offs in greater detail, offering further perspectives on risk factors contributing to evolutionary emergence.",
