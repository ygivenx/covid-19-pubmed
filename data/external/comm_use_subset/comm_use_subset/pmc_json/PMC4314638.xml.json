Treatment with Mas receptor blocker A779 before LPS stimulation also significantly increased AngII but had no obvious influence on Ang(1\u20137) levels. This may be ascribed to the significant suppression of ACE2 expression by the Mas receptor blocker. Therefore, the protective effect of ACE2 on LPS\u2013induced PMVEC injury may be via regulation of the ACE2/ACE/AngII/Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas receptor. In fact, many reports suggest that AngII exerts pro\u2013inflammatory effects by inducing the release of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species through AT1 receptors3435. AngII can also significantly induce apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells through the AT1 receptor, leading to damage in epithelial barrier function and increased permeability36.",

In the present study, we found that ACE2 overexpression significantly blocked LPS\u2013induced activation of the p38 and JNK pathways, which was strikingly prevented by administration of the Mas receptor blocker. This suggests that ACE2 is protective against LPS\u2013induced apoptosis of PMVECs and inflammation, perhaps through the Ang\u2013(1\u20137)/Mas pathway to modulate p38 and JNK phosphorylation. On the other hand, shRNA\u2013ACE2 enhanced LPS\u2013induced ERK phosphorylation but had no influence on p38 and JNK phosphorylation, whereas LPS\u2013mediated increased ERK phosphorylation was not affected by ACE2 overexpression in cells pretreated with the Mas receptor blocker. These results suggest that inhibited ACE2 aggravated LPS\u2013induced PMVEC apoptosis and inflammation mainly through the AngII/AT1 pathway to enhance ERK phosphorylation. In fact, activation of p38 MAPK and ERK is associated with TNF\u2013\u03b1\u2013induced increase of permeability in pulmonary endothelial cells, and the proliferation and survival of lung endothelial cells to maintain endothelial monolayer integrity may be by way of activating p38 MAPK39.
