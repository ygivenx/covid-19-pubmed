Apart from this, the roles of bioaerosol in atmospheric chemistry are also getting increased attention[7], [8]. For bioaerosol rated research, an important part is its sampling[9]. Following the discovery of airborne mold spores dated back to 1833, an impinger-like bioaerosol sampler was first invented and the relevant findings were published in the journal of Science\n[10]. Afterwards, a number of biological aerosol sampling devices were invented including an all-glass impinger [11], a device utilizing the electrical force[12], and a critical-orifice liquid Impinger [13]. In 1958, the six-stage Andersen sampler was invented[14], and further recommended as a standard bioaerosol sampling tool [15]. Due to its simplicity, high collection efficiency, and ease of use, Andersen-type impactor is still widely used in bioaerosol sampling, including the investigation of anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001[6].",

            "text": "Andersen-type impactor is inertia based and employed primarily in conjunction with an agar plate for sampling culturable bioaerosols. For impaction based sampler, its biological efficiency was shown to be a function of sampler cutoff size, jet-to-plate distance and microorganism[16], [17]. In addition to its overloading problems in sampling bioaerosols of high levels, its disadvantages including impaction stress, particle bounce, desiccation effects, and microbial embedding were also reported[18], [19]. The Andersen six-stage sampler has six stages, each of which has a different cutoff size, thus corresponding to different impaction velocities: 24, 12.8, 5.3, 3.0, 1.8, and 1.1 m/s. Accordingly, for different stages impaction stress is different. Among other Andersen type impactors, BioStage impactor (SKC), the sixth stage of Andersen six-stage sampler, is also widely used, including its portable version, QuickTake 30 (SKC). Use of bare agar plate for collecting culturable bioaerosols would dry agar surface over a prolonged sampling time, thus leading to the particle bounce. On the other hand, due to the high particle impaction velocity, the particle could be also embedded directly into the agar medium, which could inhibit their growth and detection[18], [19]. Besides, air desiccation also plays an important role in the decreased efficiencies when sampling bioaerosols by impactors [20]. Due to these problems, the Andersen sampler often underestimates the biological aerosol load. Unfortunately, no relevant improvements have been made in Andersen type samplers for bioaerosol sampling since its invention.",

            "text": "Mineral oil (without promoting or inhibiting bacterial growth) has been used as a collection medium for BioSampler (SKC) for extended sampling time as a means to reduce the reaerosolization problem [21]. It was shown that the BioSampler can be operated with the mineral oil for 8 hr without reduced collection efficiency [21]. In our previous study, we have improved the bioaerosol sampling for a portable bioaerosol sampler, RCS High Flow (Biotest), using mineral oil strip in replace of the agar strip where mineral oil is fully filled into those small cubes of the sampling strip [22]. Experimental results revealed that when sampling in different environments, use of mineral -oil-strip yielded significantly higher, about 4\u201312 times, culturable bacterial aerosol concentration levels compared to the use of agar strip [21]. Use of mineral-oil-strip results in less particle bounce due to its high viscosity and non-evaporating attributes. Besides, use of mineral oil could also reduce the desiccation on those bioaerosols already collected and embedded into the mineral oil. Nonetheless, the approach used in our previous work has its own limitation, i.e., after the sampling the mineral oil has to be taken out and plated on agar plate for bioaerosol detection. This extra step would lead to a loss of mineral oil on the strip in addition to possible contamination.",

To investigate effects of different impaction velocities, an Andersen six-stage sampler was used. In addition, the effects of sampling time were also studied using a BioStage impactor, the sixth stage of Andersen sampler. In this work, both aerosolized sensitive bacteria E. coli, hardy species B. subtilis and environmental bacterial and fungal bioaerosols were collected using mineral-oil-spread agar plates and compared with those regular ones. The experimental results demonstrated that use of mineral-oil-spread agar plate can substantially enhance the biological collection efficiencies of the Andersen type samplers, and the developed technology can be immediately used in enhancing current agar plate based tools for bioaerosol monitoring.",

In our experiments, we have observed that use of mineral-oil-spread agar plates substantially improved the biological collection efficiencies of Andersen type samplers for both environmental bioaerosols and aerosolized ones (p-values are shown in Table 1). Figure 1 shows the indoor bacterial aerosol sampling for 10 min using the Andersen six-stage sampler in conjunction with mineral-oil-spread and regular agar plates. As observed from the figure, regardless of the particle size ranges mineral-oil-spread agar plates were shown to substantially enhance the bacterial aerosol collection efficiencies of the Andersen six-stage sampler from 36% increase for the 6 th stage to 71% for the 3rd stage (p-values<0.05 shown in Table 1). When sampling bacterial aerosols outdoors using the Andersen six-stage sampler, similar results were obtained as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Different from indoor bacterial aerosol sampling, the protective effect was found more pronounced for the stage 4 of the sampler, about 97% enhancement. This difference is likely due to the difference in particle size distribution and bacterial aerosol compositions in different environments. In general, the observed enhancements varied with stages of the Andersen six-stage sampler, which could be attributed to the differences in several factors: impaction stress, particle size, species composition and environments.",

Due to the non-evaporating attributes of mineral oil, the agar surface is also protected from the desiccation, accordingly reducing the particle bounce. In addition, the mineral oil layer is softer than the agar surface, thus reducing the relevant impaction stress. Despite the sampling desiccation stress, i.e., amount of air impacted on agar surface per unit area per unit time[23], remained similar for the stages of the Andersen sampler operated at 28.3 L/min, each stage has a different impaction velocity: 24 (6 th stage), 12.8 (5th stage), 5.3 (4th stage), 3.0 (3rd stage), 1.8 (2nd stage) and 1.1 (1st stage) m/s, thus presenting different impaction stress. Larger bacterial particles tend to sustain higher impaction stress compared to smaller ones given similar impaction velocity. Accordingly, different stages of the Andersen sampler impart different impaction stress on the bioaerosol particles. Thus, use of mineral oil can have a greater protective effect for larger particles from the impaction stress than smaller ones. For different stages of the sampler, different size particles were collected because of their different cutoff sizes, thus the species collected onto different stages might be also different. Different species respond to the sampling stress differently. However, in natural environments bacterial particles could appear in aggregates or harbor on larger non-biological particles such that they could be collected onto upper stages of the sampler. This possibility could make differentiating the aggregates from their single cells difficult with respect to the recovery. Besides, different environments could also have different microbial species compositions. In addition, particles collected onto each stage of the Andersen six-stage sampler have stayed in the sampling line for different amount of time, and due to the particle bounce certain particles might have been impacted more than once too. Given all these influencing factors, the enhancement trend for different stages of the Andersen six-stage sampler by the mineral-oil-spread agar plate is rather difficult to predict.",

Unexpectedly, higher bacterial aerosol concentration was observed for 20 min as shown in Figure 2, which was likely due to the sudden environmental bioaerosol fluctuations. Similar results were obtained when the BioSatge impactor was used to collect outdoor bacterial aerosols under different sampling times (5, 10 and 20 min) as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Different from indoor sampling, all sampling times for outdoors were found to result in a statistical difference between mineral oil and agar plates (p-values<0.05 shown in Table 1). Compared to indoor bacterial aerosols sampling, more enhancements were observed for outdoor bacterial aerosol sampling, especially for 20 min sampling, about 2 times protection effects obtained for outdoor bacterial aerosols by use of mineral oil. This might be due to species compositions and their different sensitivity to the sampling stress in different environments. In different environments, Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria might account for different percentages, and they could respond to the sampling stress differently. Accordingly, different enhancements are expected by use of the mineral oil.

Regardless of the sampling time, use of mineral-oil-spread agar plates was shown to substantially enhance the recovery rates of both species compared to the regular ones without the mineral oil plated (p-values<0.05 shown in Table 1). In general, for B. subtilis aerosols increasing sampling time was observed to lead to a decrease of aerosolized culturable bacterial aerosol counts collected by the regular agar plate due to the prolonged sampling desiccation; however for mineral-oil-spread agar plates increasing sampling time resulted in an increased recovery rate of bioaerosols, e.g., from 47% increase at 5 min to 60% at 20 min. This on the other hand indicates that the sampling stress causes a large number of bacteria cells to become non-culturable, while use of mineral oil can effectively minimize such side effects. Similar to B. subtilis, increasing sampling time resulted in increased recovery rates for E. coli aerosols, e.g., from 64% increase at 5 min to 107% at 20 min, when mineral-oil-spread agar plates used. In general, higher enhancement rates were observed for E. coli than B. subtilis at all sampling times by mineral-oil-spread agar plates. E. coli is a Gram-negative bacteria, more sensitive to environmental stress compared to Gram-positive B. subtilis, accordingly use of mineral oil had more protective effects on E. coli. In general, increasing sampling time also led to the decrease of culturable E. coli and B. subtilis counts given only mineral-oil-spread agar plates used. For environmental bioaerosols, the enhancement was found relatively lower (not statistically significant) for 5 min sampling time, which was possibly due to less particle bounce and desiccation. In contrast, for freshly aerosolized bacterial aerosols the enhancement was also found statistically significant more than 40% increase for the same sampling time. The difference might be due to the initial viability of the bioaerosols being sampled, i.e., high viability for freshly aerosolized bioaerosols and low viability for environmental ones.",

One study also indicated that the decreases in bioaerosol recovery by several portable microbial samplers were attributed to the desiccation of the agar plate (causing particle bounce) and those already collected bioaerosol particles [20]. Use of mineral oil can minimize the relevant desiccation problems due to its non-evaporating attributes. Previously, we have demonstrated that portable BioStage impactor reported higher culturable bacteria and fungal concentrations under 5 min sampling than the RCS High Flow due to the higher desiccation effects of the RCS High Flow sampler, about 8 times higher than the BioStage impactor [23]. In our recent study, we have shown that use of mineral-oil-filled agar strip resulted in about 4\u201312 times higher culturable bacterial aerosol concentration compared to the use of agar strips with RCS High Flow sampler[22].

These results suggest that fungal aerosols might appear to be more desiccation resistant with less particle bounce, and use of mineral oil might not significantly improve their recoveries from pure desiccation effects given the same impaction velocity. Previously, it was also indicated that extended sampling time up to 6 h did not affect the culturability of certain fungal species by the filtration sampling method at a composting site [25]. In another study, fungal spores were also shown desiccation resistant as extended sampling did not reduce the culturability, instead increasing sampling time and flow rate resulted in decreased fungal spore recoveries for AGI-30 [26]. The observed low recovery for fungal spores with AGI-30 sampler in their study is likely due to the high impaction stress caused by the impingement process. In our previous study, we observed that electrostatic sampling that has several orders magnitude lower impaction velocity obtained richer fungal species than other samplers such as the BioStage impactor with higher impaction velocity[19]. These results suggest that fungal aerosols might be more susceptible to high impaction stress than desiccation.",

Increasing sampling time would certainly increase the desiccation effects, and as discussed use of mineral oil could minimize such effects since the collected bacterial particles can be embedded into the mineral oil, thus adding a layer of protection. Compared to the last stage of the Andersen six-stage sampler for 10 min sampling, the enhancement rate for the BIoStage impactor appeared slightly smaller. This could be due to the differences in the bioaerosol particles being collected by the same stage of two different samplers given the impaction stress remained the same (the same impaction velocity 24 m/s). For the last stage of the Andersen sampler, bioaerosol particles being collected should be smaller ones (larger ones already collected by 1\u20135 stages), while those being collected by the BioStage impactor include all bioaerosol particles. In addition, the bioaerosol particles being collected by the last stage of the Andersen sampler have stayed in the sampling line for longer time compared to those for the BioStage impactor, thus sustaining more sampling injuries. Besides, bioaerosol particles being collected by the last stage of the Andersen sampler might have been impacted several times before their collection due to the particle bounce on the agar surface. As a result of these differences, the bioaerosol particles might have experienced more stress for last stage of the Andersen sampler compared to the BioStage impactor. While use of mineral oil can effectively minimize such effects, accordingly higher enhancement was observed for the last stage of the Andersen sampler than the BioStage impactor when comparing their samplings for 10 min.",

As discussed, for the Andersen sampler, due to the particle bounce many bioaerosol particles have been impacted more than once, thus sustaining more impaction injuries. However, for the BioStage impactor it is only one time impaction on the agar plate. Accordingly, more enhancements by mineral-oil-spread agar plates were observed with the last stage of the Andersen type sampler than the BioStage impactor. The observed enhancements for biaoerosol recovery using mineral-oil-spread agar plates here are primarily due to the reduced sampling stress (impaction and desiccation) and particle bounce problems.",

            "text": "Overall, experimental results in this work showed that use of mineral oil can sustain prolonged sampling time without reduced culturable bioaerosol recoveries when Andersen type samplers are used. As indicated by the results from the Andersen sampler and the BioStage impactor, the recovery enhancement was shown to depend on bioaerosol size, type, sampling time and environment. It appears that more fungal recoveries were attributed to the reduced impaction stress, while those for bacteria were likely arising from impaction, desiccation and particle bounce reduction by mineral-oil-spread agar plate. Future studies might need to be conducted with more pure bacterial species and different amount of mineral oil. Uniform oil plating on the agar plate might also further increase the bioaerosol recoveries for impaction based sampling technique. Besides, use of selective medium for impaction and desiccation injuries can identify the main contributing factors for improved bioaerosol recoveries using mineral-oil-spread agar plates under different conditions. Previously, high volume portable agar-plate based microbial samplers have been investigated for sampling both aerosolized and environmental bioaerosols[16], [17], and one recent study indicated that the sampling time for these portable samplers should be as short as possible to avoid the bioaerosol particle bounce and desiccation problems [20]. Importantly, the results from this work indicated that use of mineral-oil-spread agar plate can eliminate such restrictions. Therefore, the developed technique can extend the capability of high volume portable sampler to collect bioaerosols over extended time duration, especially for those in low concentration levels.",

However, to our knowledge subsequent improvements for its problems such as particle bounce and desiccation has not been attempted. Here, we significantly improved its biological collection efficiencies by plating a layer of mineral oil (180 \u00b5m thick) on the regular plate as depicted in Figure 8. On the other hand, the results here also imply that traditional use of regular plate with the Andersen type impactors significantly underestimates actual bioaerosol loads. Application of mineral oil layer on the agar plate surface can substantially minimize the longstanding problems such as particle bounce and desiccation associated with agar-based bioaerosol sampling. In addition, use of mineral-oil-layer could also enable the increase of impaction velocity for increasing physical collection efficiency in future developments of impaction-based samplers. Here, only mineral oil was tested, and other type of non-evaporating collection media can be also spread on the agar plate for enhanced bioaerosol sampling. The developed technique here is very simple, and can be immediately applied to bioaerosol sampling with enhanced efficiency for various agar-based collection techniques.",
