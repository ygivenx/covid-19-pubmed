A random-effect was used to estimate the pooled ORs and 95% CIs, as heterogeneity was found with I2 > 10%. Statistical significance is set at below 0.05 threshold level. Between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistics. The range of I2 values quantifies the between-study variability present not owing to random chance; they have the following distribution: 0% to 25% = low heterogeneity, 25% to 50% = moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 75% = large heterogeneity, and 75 to 100 = considerable heterogeneity. When I2 surpasses 50% threshold, it is warranted to use additional meta-analysis techniques such as subgroup analysis or meta-regression to explain the variance between studies.

To our best knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate the association between TGF-\u03b21 gene polymorphism and pulmonary fibrosis development. Although some studies reported association between them, our meta-analysis did not find any TGF-\u03b21 rs1800470 polymorphism associated with susceptibility to pulmonary fibrosis. The present finding is consistent with the general trend from various pulmonary fibrosis genetic studies, which can be attributed to the polygenetic nature of the disorder.[25,26] Further subgroup analysis and publication bias test (P > .05) provided additional support for the robustness of our results.",

First, there is a lack of broader coverage on the investigation of other TGF-\u03b21 polymorphisms related to pulmonary fibrosis risk, thus hindering our ability to conduct a wider spectrum of analysis encompassing more SNPs. The present meta-analysis was only able to collect data on one most studied SNP to perform the effect size calculation. There are other relevant TGF-\u03b21 SNPs that have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis susceptibility; one example is the SNP rs1800471, which has been associated with fibrosis in lung transplant recipients,[20] but the locus was omitted in our analysis owing to a lack of sufficient studies (i.e., <3 studies that provided reusable genetic information). Second, in case-control design studies, population stratification analysis is often necessary to warrant that samples in cases and controls share common genetic characteristics other than the SNPs of interest.[29] Thus, some of our results may be hampered by this shortcoming. For example, some studies didn\u2019t provide smoke status information of subjects. Differences in smoke ratio are of particular importance, since smoke people are more likely to predispose to pulmonary fibrosis.[30,31] Owing to the lack of genotype information by smoke status, we were unable to do a subgroup analysis. Third, in view of the relatively small sample size and the limited study number, especially in the subgroup of the non-IPF disease where only 2 studies were included, the power used to detect the real difference between cases and controls may not be very strong. Finally, PF is a multifactorial disease, the potential interaction of genetic\u2013genetic or genetic\u2013environmental factors may influence the process of PF.",
