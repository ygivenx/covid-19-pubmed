Minimum 3 technical replicates for each sample were used for the analysis.

A previous study reported that severe immunological defects affecting the immunity in human primary immunodeficiency syndrome was associated with reduced levels of LAMTOR2 [22]. Hence, the elevated serum levels of ragulator complex in our study may be associated with host\u2019s response by increasing macrophage activity and enhancing adaptive immunity in response to LPS.

In this study, up-regulated expression of Gal-3BP may be associated with limiting an on-going inflammation in response to LPS, because of its immune modulatory activity [23]. In addition, overexpressed Gal-3BP may be considered as a host response to neutralize harmful effects of Galectin-3 which is released from LPS-stimulated cells to produce heightened levels of inflammatory mediators, resulting in further tissue damage and, ultimately, organ failure, characteristics of sepsis. On the other hand, Gal-3BP has a critical role in the development of venous thrombosis [24] and to increase the survival of cancer cells in the bloodstream [25], indicating that probably is involved in the pathophysiological responses of different pathological conditions.",

Therefore the decrease of these proteins could be associated with the preventive effects of choline treatment on the development of coagulopathy, as described previously in dogs [7]. In addition the down-regulation of histones after choline treatment would be related with the protective effect of choline. Histone proteins, mainly the histones-H3 and H4, have been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity when released to the extracellular fluid in response to severe stress or inflammatory challenges like sepsis and to mediate excessive and overwhelming cell damage and death [31]. Hemopexin (Hx) is mainly expressed as an APP from liver after inflammation [32]. In this study, Hx overexpression may be related with its antioxidant role [32] to facilitate tissue repair in response to LPS [33]. Choline treatment decreased Hx overexpression in calves with LPS, probably related with the reduction in body\u2019s antioxidant needs [32, 34] due to the reduction in tissue damage produced by choline [3].",

SIMD is a well-recognized manifestation of organ dysfunction in patient with sepsis [37] and calves with endotoxemia [38]. LPS-induced overexpression of ACTC1 may contribute to myocardial dysfunction during endotoxemia [39], most probably due to impaired sarcomere integrity [40]. The observed overexpression of ACTC1 may be due to decreased thymosin beta-10 expression since thymosin beta-10 plays an important role in the organization of the cytoskeleton by binding to and sequestering actin monomers resulting with an inhibition in actin polymerization [41].",

It could be concluded that based on our experimental model, following LPS administration, there are changes in selected serum proteins which are associated with various biological processes such as lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory response, protein binding and transport, cell adhesion, venous thrombosis, cardiac contraction and blood coagulation. In addition choline administration is associated with changes in serum concentrations of selected serum proteins that would be related with its beneficial effect in this clinical situation. These findings would reinforce the effectiveness of choline administration in the treatment of endotoxemia. However further studies are needed to confirm our results due to small sample size of this study, and in addition it would be interesting to evaluate the effectiveness of choline treatment in combination with other drugs such as steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",
