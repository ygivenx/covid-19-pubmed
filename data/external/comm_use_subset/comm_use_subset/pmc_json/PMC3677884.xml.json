            "text": "Calreticulin (CRT) is a 46 kDa Ca2+-binding glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells [1]\u2013[2]. It folds into 3 domains including a lectin-like globular N domain (amino acid residues 18\u2013197), a proline-rich P domain (residues 198\u2013308) and a Ca2+-binding C domain (residues 309\u2013412) [3]\u2013[5]. CRT can also appear at the surface of various types of cells exhibiting multiple biological functions [6]\u2013[12]. Recently it has been shown that soluble CRT is present in the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and with SLE [13]\u2013[14] and that natural CRT (nCRT), isolated from human or mouse tissues, can directly activate macrophages in vitro [15]. Additionally, rCRT/39-272, a prokaryotically-expressed murine CRT fragment covering amino acid residues 39\u2013272 fused with an N-terminal His-tag, was extraordinarily potent in activating B cells and macrophages in vitro and also in eliciting specific Ab production in mice [16]. This recombinant polypeptide also exhibited potent adjuvanticity, effectively assisting IgG production against conjugated target Ags with or without T cell help [16]\u2013[17]. However, molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are far from clear. Recent X-ray crystographical studies by Kozlov et al and Chouquet et al have defined the carbohydrate-binding site (involving residues Phe74, Met131, His145, Ile147 and the Cys107\u2013Cys137) and also a peptide-binding site on its opposite side (Phe74, Trp319, Cys105\u2013Cys137, Asp135) in the N domain of CRT [18], [19]. The sequence of rCRT/39-272 encompasses most of the globular N domain (aa residues 18\u2013198), and we have previously shown that it possess lectin-like activity (selective binding with polysaccharides including carrageenan, alginic acids, and hyaluronic acids in ELISAs) [16], implying that the prokaryotically expressed recombinant polypeptide retained the lectin activity of CRT. It is of interest to determine if destroying the carbohydrate binding and/or peptide-binding sites (by deleting first half of the N domain sequence) would also abolish the potent immunological activities observed in rCRT/39-272.",

            "text": "Additionally, the fact that rCRT/39-272 is substantially more potent than nCRT in activating macrophages(see below) raised concerns regarding the possibility of LPS contamination in the E. coli.-expressed recombinant product. The \u201cLPS contamination\u201d hypothesis suggests tight binding between bacterial LPS and rCRT and also that, due to a synergistic effect, the LPS-CRT complex is a more potent immune activator than free LPS and rCRT alone. Based upon the observation that interaction between the N and C domains of CRT influences its structural stability as well as functional activity [20], a \u201cC-domain deletion\u201d hypothesis has also been postulated, suggesting that deletion of the C-domain (as in rCRT/39-272) leads to exposure of an immunologically active site (IAS) in the N and/or P domains of CRT. The present study compares the biochemical characteristics of nCRT and a series of truncated rCRT polypeptides and investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the potent immunological activities of soluble rCRT. The results arising from this study have important implications for our understanding of the potential role of soluble CRT in immunopathological conditions.",

Purified nCRT was also able to activate macrophages in vitro, but with a 50-100-fold lower potency than rCRT/18-412 (Fig. 2A). Although rCRT/18-412 and rCRT/39-272 preparations had been repeatedly treated with polymyxin B (an efficient LPS inhibitor) prior to functional assays, the possibility that bacterial LPS might form a tight complex with rCRT, thereby resisting PMB treatment, was always a concern. Figs. 2B & 2C demonstrate that nCRT was not able to bind LPS in ELISAs, implying that formation of tight LPS-CRT complexes in the expressing E. coli cells is perhaps an unlikely event. Moreover, LPS and nCRT at sub-optimal concentrations did not show any synergistic effect in activating macrophages (Fig. 2D), providing circumstantial evidence against the \u201cLPS contamination\u201d hypothesis.",

To characterize this protein, the Cp32 band was sliced out of SDS-PAGE gels and then (i) used to immunize C57/BL6 mice for preparation of specific antisera; and (ii) subjected to Q-TOF mass spectrometry analysis for sequence identification. The resultant antisera (Cp32-Abs) were able to recognize the immunizing protein band, but not the rCRT-60 kDa and rCRT-46 kDa bands, in WB (Fig. 3B). The MS result identified Cp32 as bacterial 50S ribosomal protein L2 (RPL2), which was confirmed by positive recognition of recombinant RPL2 (rRPL2, commercially available) by Cp32-Abs (Fig. 3B). It is noteworthy that rRPL2 was unable to activate macrophages, as evidenced in NO2\n\u2212 production assays (Fig. 3C), and also that rRPL2 was not recognized by CRT-Abs (Figs. 4C & 4D). These results exclude the possibility that the contaminant Cp32 could make a substantial contribution to the immunological activities of rCRT.",

Fig. 4A shows that rCRT/18-412 was successfully separated into 3 peaks, designated sequentially as OrCRT (higher-molecular-weight rCRT/18-412 oligomers, major peak), MrCRT-60 kDa (monomeric rCRT/18-412, 60 kDa) and MrCRT-46 kDa (monomeric rCRT-46 kDa, aa18-386, see below).

Subsequent Q-TOF MS analysis on samples of MrCRT-60 kDa and MrCRT-46 kDa, both of which were specifically recognized by CRT-Abs in WB (Figs. 4C & 4D), revealed their molecular mass as 46.78 kDa and 43.57 kDa, respectively.

All, but rCRT/198-308 (very low yield and poor solubility), were successfully expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified. Both rCRT/120-250 and rCRT-N formed homodimers as well as higher-molecular-weight species (Fig. 6A). rCRT/120-250 was as potent as rCRT/39-272 and rCRT/18-412 in terms of eliciting NO2\n\u2212 production by murine macrophages, while rCRT-N was almost completely inactive (Fig. 6B). Similar to rCRT/120-250, rCRT/120-308 also formed homodimers and higher-molecular-weight oligomers and showed strong macrophage-stimulatory activity in vitro (Table 1). rCRT/150-230, which contains a single cysteine residue (Cys163) and could only form homodimers (Fig. 6A), was approximately 10 fold less effective than rCRT/39-272 and rCRT/120-250 but nevertheless substantially more potent than MrCRTs and nCRT (Fig. 6B). A mutant form of rCRT/150-230 (namely rCRT/150-230-C163A) was prepared by substituting the cysteine residue at position 163 with alanine. The C163A mutant was neither able to form homodimers/oligomers in solution nor activate macrophages in vitro (Figs. 6C\u20136E). These results map the IAS of CRT to residues 150\u2013230 and suggest that the N-domain probably does not contribute to the immunological activity of the molecule. Moreover, the importance of oligomerization for its immunological activities is further confirmed.",

Our data strongly suggests that self-oligomerization of the rCRT polypeptides is a key factor for their strong immunological activities. As summarized in Table 1, all four rCRT fragments containing residues 120\u2013250 (including rCRT/18-412, rCRT/39-272, rCRT/120-250 and rCRT/120-308) self-oligomerized and exhibited potent macrophage activating ability in vitro and strong immunogenicity in vivo, while nCRT, which existed mainly in monomeric form, showed only modest stimulatory activities towards macrophages and was non-immunogenic in mice (Figs. 1 & 3). Moreover, fractionated rCRT/18-412 oligomers were 50\u2013100 folds more active than MrCRTs in activating macrophages in vitro (Fig. 5). The N domain polypeptide (rCRT/18-197) also formed higher-molecular-weight oligomers (Fig. 6A), but it is almost completely inactive in terms of stimulating macrophages in vitro (Fig. 6B) and inducing Ab responses in vivo (Table 1).

            "text": "Dimerization/oligomerization of soluble CRT was also observed by previous investigators. For example, Jorgensen et al documented that shielding of the free Cys163 in the N domain is the main reason that nCRT exists mainly in monomeric form under physiological conditions. Under partial unfolding conditions such as high temperature or low PH, however, the free Cys could be exposed and subsequently help CRT oligomerization [23]. nCRT (isolated from human placenta) formed homodimers and higher-molecular-weight species through disulfide bonding as well as non-covalent association, and that oligomerized nCRT showed higher binding affinity to peptides and denatured proteins [23]. In the case of prokaryotically expressed rCRT polypeptides (the folding of which may differ from nCRT), all Cys residues in sequence could contribute to its olimerization, although it might not be absolutely necessary that all 3 Cys residues have to be available for inter-molecular cross-linking at the same time. Mancino and colleagues illustrated that self-oligomerized rCRT could better assist HLA folding in vitro [24]. There are 3 conserved cysteine residues in the amino acid sequence of CRT. Cys105 and Cys137 form intramolecular disulfide bonds, while Cys163 is free [25]-[26]. It is likely that rCRT polypeptides are unable to form appropriate intra-molecular disulfide bonds like in nCRT, thereby allowing all 3 cysteine residues to participate in self-oligomerization, although formation of higher-molecular-weight oligomers could also occur through non-covalent association of CRT [23], [27]. CRT is considered one of the heat shock proteins (HSPs) that share many immunological and biochemical activities [28]-[29]. Interestingly, self-oligomerization also occurs to other HSPs such as GRP94 and HSP90, which is likely associated with their chaperone function [30]\u2013[32].",

            "text": "Koslov et al and Chouquet et al have recently solved the crystal structure of the lectin site as well as a peptide-binding site in the CRT N domain [18], [19], which apparently play important roles in the physiological function of CRT. However, our data maps the IAS of CRT to a region of 80 residues between aa150\u2013230 (Fig. 6). As rCRT-N was almost completely inactive in functional assays (Fig. 6, Table 1), the IAS may be narrowed down further to aa198\u2013230 in the P domain, although a series of truncated synthetic peptides covering this region would be needed for a concrete conclusion. Interestingly, this sequence of 30 amino acid residues contains the RA shared epitope (SE)-binding site (residues 217\u2013224) of CRT recently mapped by Ling et al. [33]. Such coinciding results from 2 independent groups further emphasize the importance of the aa198\u2013230 region of the P domain to the immunological activities of CRT. It has been documented that the CRT P domain adopts a hairpin-shaped structure, its sequence is consisted of 3 copies of a repeat motif (type 1: IXDPXXXKPEDWD) followed by 3 copies of another repeat motif (type 2) [34]\u2013[36]. Interestingly, the SE-binding site almost completely overlaps the type 1 motif [33]. It is reasonable to suggest that the type 1 motif might also represent the core of IAS of CRT, responsible for direct biding with activation receptors on the surface of immune cells. Functional comparison data showed that rCRT/120-308 and rCRT/120-250 (possessing 3 type 1 repeats, the latter without type 2 repeats) are 10 times more active than rCRT/120-230 (with 2 type 1 repeats, no type 2 repeats) in activating macrophages (Table 1, Fig. 6B), implying that (i) type 2 repeats do not contribute to the immunological activity of the molecule; and (ii) the presence of 3 copies of the type 1 motif is of crucial importance for the potent immunological function of OrCRTs. It can be envisaged that oligomerization of CRT multiplies its binding avidity to immune cells with receptors for the type 1 motif, thereby enabling it to deliver stimulatory signals to the cells in a highly efficient manner.",

Indeed, OrCRTs can activate macrophages in an endocytosis-dependent pathway (Fig. 7). Perhaps OrCRTs could use certain intracellular sensors to deliver immunostimulatory activity to the responding immune cells. An example of an intracellular sensor for endocytosed polymeric proteins is the NOD-like receptor (NLR) protein NLRP3, a key component of the NLRP3 inflammasome and an important intracellular sensor for microbial ligands and endogenous danger signals [37]. Masters and colleagues demonstrated that soluble oligomers of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a protein that forms amyloid deposits in the pancreas during type 2 diabetes, could be endocytosed and trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome and generate mature IL-1\u03b2 [38].",
