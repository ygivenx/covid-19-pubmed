After its first occurrence, SARS rapidly spread around the world along international air-travel routes, reaching all five continents and resulting in several hundreds of deaths [5]. The most recent epidemic of SARS occurred in Beijing and Anhui, China in April 2004 and originated from laboratory contamination (WHO update 7; see Further Information). Although the outbreaks seem to be over, SARS remains a safety concern because of the possible reintroduction of a SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) into humans and the risk of an escape of SARS-CoV from laboratories [6-8]. More importantly, a new recombinant virus derived from human [9], swine and/or avian influenza virus, might re-emerge as a new SARS-CoV type, much like the recent emergence of a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) in humans. Thus, it is essential to develop various and distinct strategies to combat this highly contagious disease.",

Hence, both humoral and cellular immune responses appear to be crucial for the clearance of SARS-CoV infection. Immune responses can be raised directly against several of the SARS-CoV proteins [13-15]. Targeting the spike (S) structural glycoprotein [12,16-18] in particular induces a robust immune response, suggesting it plays an important role in the systemic clearance of SARS-CoV [10]. The viral surface S protein is involved in host cell receptor recognition, virus attachment and entry [19]; adaptive evolution of S protein, thus, contributes to SARS-CoV overcoming the species barrier [20]. Hence, many vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV target the S protein [19]. Considering that cytotoxic T-cell responses participate in the clearance of virus from recovered SARS patients and contribute to immunopathology in early stages of the disease [21], one of the most attractive S protein-based strategies proposes eliciting a SARS-CoV CTL response to clear the infection. To this end, a detailed understanding of the S protein-mediated CTL response is essential.",

The identification of HLA-A*0201-restricted SARS-CoV/S CTL epitopes is an important contribution towards understanding the role of CTLs in SARS-CoV pathogenesis and protection. Currently, several CTL-specific SARS-CoV S protein epitopes have been identified in the context of HLA-A*0201, including S411-420, S787-795, S978-986, S1042-1050, S1167-1175, S1203-1211 and SSp-1 [23-26], and the H2 complex, including S366-374, S436-443, S525-532 and S1031-1047 [18,27]. It is likely that additional S protein CTL epitopes exist. S protein is relatively large in size and usage of different detection methods may result in the identification of novel S protein-derived epitopes. In turn, this data will provide advances towards understanding the mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection, and contribute to the development of future SARS-CoV infection intervention strategies.",

Based on a binding affinity-based prediction and a proteosomal cleavage site prediction, we constructed a panel of potential HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL peptides from the S protein. Each candidate peptide was evaluated for its binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules using the T2 cell-peptide binding test. We then evaluated the ability of HLA-A*0201 binding peptides to provoke CTL responses in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). PBL preparations from major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched healthy donors or HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic (Tg) mice, were incubated with dendritic cells (DCs) that had been pre-pulsed with the peptides of interest. We identified a novel SARS-CoV S protein-derived CTL epitope S(958-966)(VLNDILSRL) that was capable of priming the S protein-specific HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL response. The effective CTL response was evidenced by cell death of peptide-pulsed T2 and peptide-pulsed Jurkat-A2/Kb cells. The findings of this study should provide insight into the immunological characteristics of spike protein and provide an alternative strategy for the future development of SARS-CoV S protein CTL epitope-based vaccines.",

After alignment of the amino acid residues of S protein with eighteen SARS-CoV strains (Figure 1), the BJ01 strain S protein was selected to predict the S protein specific, HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes.

T2 cells lack the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), a key factor involved in endogenous antigen processing and presentation, causing the empty HLA-I molecules on the T2 cell surface to be very unstable and to degrade rapidly after cell surface presentation. However, when exogenous epitope peptides bind to the HLA-I molecules on the cell surface, they become stable [28,29]. Accordingly, the peptide-induced upregulation of HLA-I on TAP-deficient T2 cells is used to monitor peptide binding to class I molecules, which then indicates the binding affinity of peptides to HLA-I molecules. Higher-affinity peptides will induce more HLA-A*0201 expression on the cell surface than will lower-affinity peptides. As shown in Table 1, of the eight candidate peptides only Sp5, Sp6, Sp7 and Sp8 were high-affinity epitopes (FI = 1.1, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5, respectively). The positive control peptide, S411-420, bound HLA-A*0201 strongly (FI = 1.5), whereas no binding was observed with the negative control HBcAg(131-140) peptide (FI = 0.1).",

T2 cells loaded with each of peptides were used as target cells in cytotoxicity assays. Of the eight peptides tested, Sp6, Sp7 and Sp8 induced more CD8+ T-cells that specifically produced IFN-\u03b3 in response to DCs pulsed with the relevant peptides or positive control peptide in comparison to other groups (Figure 2A). Furthermore, these CD8+ T cells could lyse the T2 cells loaded with relevant peptides or positive control peptide more efficiently than other groups (Figure 2B). The cytolysis observed were specific because the CTLs could not lyse T2 cells loaded with irrelevant peptides (Figure 2B). Due to the limited induction of IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cell frequency and the low CTL cytolysis ability, groups other than Sp6, Sp7 and Sp8 were excluded from further study. The ex vivo results showed the existence of functional anti-SARS-CoV/S CTL precursors in the peripheral T cell repertoire of healthy donors. Furthermore, SARS-CoV/S-derived peptides Sp6, Sp7 and Sp8 could not only induce the increased S protein specific IFN-\u03b3 secreting T cell frequency but also the enhanced cytolytic capacity of these CTLs.",

It has been reported that an inflammatory cell influx of airway macrophages and a massive release of cytokines occur during the peak of SARS infection [30].

The eight predicted peptides were then verified via MHC peptide binding assay (Table 1). Among the eight candidate peptides, Sp5, Sp6, Sp7 and Sp8 exhibited the highest capacity to induce more potent CTLs secreting IFN-\u03b3 and to lyse target cells from HLA-A*0201-matched healthy donor PBLs (Figure 2). Further in vivo investigation showed that plasmid encoding the full-length SARS-CoV S gene elicited strong CTL response in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice. These CTLs could produce substantial amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and kill target cells in a peptide-specific and HLA-A*0201-restricted manner (Figure 3), suggesting the predicted candidate peptides were native epitopes, capable of priming CTL responses in vivo. We found that candidate peptide Sp8 held the greatest ability to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and kill target cells in vivo (Figure 3). Another candidate peptide, Sp7, failed to induce the most potent peptide specific CTLs in Tg mice (Figure 3), despite it having had the highest such ability in comparison to the rest of the in vitro stimulation set (Figure 2), indicating the need for candidate peptides to be biofunctionally validated in vivo.",
