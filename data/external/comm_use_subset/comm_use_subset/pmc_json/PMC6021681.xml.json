            "text": "Urbanization, human migrations, and climate changes facilitate the emergence or reemergence of a large number of viruses causing unexpected illnesses and epidemics, while the capacity to identify and control emerging diseases is limited in poorer regions where many of them have their origin (1). Among emerging and reemerging viruses, members of the Flaviviridae family represent a global public health issue. The Flaviviridae family consists of four genera (Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus, and Pestivirus), which include viruses responsible for important animal and human diseases, such as yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and dengue virus (DENV). YFV, ZIKV, JEV, WNV, and DENV are leading causes of arthropod-borne human diseases worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), they globally infect 400 million individuals each year, causing approximately 80,000 deaths each year. HCV is a blood-borne Hepacivirus responsible for chronic liver diseases causing approximately 700,000 deaths annually (2). Approximately 71 million individuals are infected worldwide, representing 1% of the global population (3). The recent approval of a large number of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that are active against HCV, including generic compounds, has revolutionized the treatment of this infection, with more than 95% rates of infection cure (4). In contrast, no antiviral drugs are available so far to cure infections caused by arthropod-borne members of the Flaviviridae family, despite their global public health importance.",

            "text": "During the past 10 years, two different types of antiviral agents, including DAAs and host-targeting antiviral (HTA) agents, have been developed for the treatment of HCV infection. Among the HTAs, nonimmunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporine (CsA) that target host cyclophilins (Cyps) yielded the most promising results. Alisporivir (ALV) was the first HTA to enter HCV clinical development and reach phase III clinical trials (5, 6). Its development was halted following the report of seven cases of acute pancreatitis, including a lethal one (7). These events were independent from Cyp inhibition, most likely due to ALV-induced hypertriglyceridemia that potentiated the pancreatic toxicity of interferon alpha that was part of the combination regimens. Although the cyclophilin inhibitors (CypIs) failed to reach the market for the indication of hepatitis C treatment, they remain attractive to combat other viral infections (8\u201311). Indeed, CypIs have been reported to be involved in the life cycles of viruses other than HCV (12) while having a high barrier to resistance, broad antiviral activity, and possibly additive or synergistic effects with other antiviral compounds in various models.",

Seventeen human Cyps have been identified, but more may exist. Cyps have been convincingly shown to play a pivotal role in the life cycles of a large number of viruses from different families (12). However, there are few data available regarding the anti-Flaviviridae activity of CypIs, all of which were obtained with CsA and ALV (9, 13\u201315). The molecular mechanisms of the anti-HCV activity of CypIs are not yet fully understood. It is believed that they exert their antiviral effect by disrupting the CypA-nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) interaction that regulates multiple phases of HCV replication (16, 17).",

The immunosuppressive agent CsA has been reported to bear antiviral activity against DENV-2, WNV, and YFV (15), with less potency against WNV. Results regarding the susceptibility of ZIKV to CsA are limited and contradictory (24). This sparseness of data prompted us to assess the anti-Flaviviridae activity of our new SMCypI. Here, we showed that C31, a SMCypI inhibitor of PPIase activity with anti-HCV activity in vitro, also inhibits the replication of several members of the Flaviviridae family in cell culture models. C31 was most effective against HCV and DENV replication, with EC50s in the low-micromolar range. C31 inhibited YFV and ZIKV replication to a lesser extent, with EC50s in the micromolar range. Although the EC50 was above 50 \u03bcM, the highest concentration tested, a trend toward a decrease of viral replication was also observed with WNV (data not shown). In contrast, no effect of C31 against JEV replication has been observed in our experiments (data not shown). To our knowledge, C31 is the first SMCypI with the potential for broad anti-Flaviviridae activity. Given the chemical plasticity and simplicity of synthesis of this new family of SMCypIs, a large number of new compounds will be synthesized in the future. It is thus likely that C31 derivatives with greater effectiveness against different members of the Flaviviridae family will be generated.",

It was demonstrated previously that CypA PPIase activity is required for HCV replication (28, 29). Our library of SMCypIs (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) provides us with a unique, thus-far-missing pharmacological tool to dissect the molecular mechanisms of Cyp-virus interactions and of the antiviral effects of Cyp inhibition. The library of SMCypIs proved to be particularly useful to discriminate PPIase-dependent antiviral activity from effects related to other functional roles of the Cyps. Using several SMCypI derivatives with different potencies of inhibition of PPIase catalytic activity, we showed that the antiviral activity of the SMCypIs strongly correlates with their PPIase-inhibitory potency, confirming that Cyp PPIase activity is required for HCV replication.",

Disruption of this key interaction by CsA or ALV impairs HCV replication, possibly explaining the anti-HCV effect of these compounds (27, 31). Whether similar mechanisms could be involved with other families of Cyp inhibitors remained unknown. We showed that the NS5A-CypA interaction was disrupted by C31. We also modeled the CypA binding modes of C31 and CsA. As expected, their superimposition suggested that both compounds shared a partially overlapping binding site. This result was confirmed by means of a TR-FRET assay, which showed that C31 displaces CsA from the CypA catalytic site. Interestingly, we also observed that the aniline moiety of C31 was deeply buried in a pocket contiguous to the canonical catalytic site, the gatekeeper pocket, which is out of reach for CsA, suggesting that the modes of inhibition of CsA and SMCypIs may partially differ. This could explain why CsA and ALV did not inhibit ZIKV replication in this study, whereas C31 did, possibly through a PPIase-independent mechanism different from that involved in HCV inhibition (data not shown).",

Their mechanism of antiviral action against one of these viruses, HCV, is related to Cyp binding, the inhibition of PPIase catalytic activity, and a disruption of the CypA-NS5A interaction, a mechanism common to other cyclophilin inhibitors derived from CsA. Nonimmunosuppressive analogues of CsA suffer from serious caveats, including their large size, resulting in poor cell permeability; their side effects unrelated to cyclophilin inhibition; their drug-drug interactions; and manufacturing issues. Thus, because of their chemical plasticity, low cellular toxicity, and simplicity of synthesis, our new family of SMCypIs represents a promising new class of drugs with broad-spectrum anti-Flaviviridae properties as well as an invaluable tool to explore the role of cyclophilins in virus life cycles and the mechanisms to block them.",

Briefly, CypA was tagged with a polyhistidine sequence (6His) and formed a complex with an anti-6His antibody labeled with a fluorescent donor, F(d), while CsA was tagged with a fluorescent acceptor, F(a). C31 was added to the master mix containing the CypA-antibody-CsA complex, with a final concentration of detergent of 0.01%. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the plate was read on a SpectraMax M5 instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 2 wavelengths to detect F(d) and F(a) emissions. The F(a)/F(d) ratio was calculated, and the values were plotted against the inhibitor concentration in log10 molar and fitted by using one-site Ki nonlinear regression to determine the Kd. Nonlabeled CsA and ALV were used as controls.",
