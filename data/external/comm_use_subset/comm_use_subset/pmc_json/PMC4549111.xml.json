Several Sporothrix spp., previously reported to be closely related to S. schenckii, are known to establish infections in various hosts, with dissimilar virulence traits [3, 4] and responsiveness to antifungal treatment [5].",

Sporothrix spp. are endowed with an extraordinary ecological diversity [12\u201315]; they are frequently recovered from soil, plants debris, and insects (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Phylogenetic data support a recent habitat shift within Sporothrix from plants to cats [9] that culminated in the largest epizootic transmission in southeastern Brazil [16\u201319]. Feline sporotrichosis emerged in the 1990s, with S. brasiliensis recovered from many outbreaks [8, 20]. More recently, S. brasiliensis has been recognized as a threat to humans [21\u201323] due to the massive zoonotic transmission in southeastern Brazil that affects thousands of patients regardless of whether they are immunocompetent or immunocompromised [9, 24\u201326].",

Most human cases occurred in housewives and professionals who had contact with infected animals and a history of scratches or bites [21, 28]. The largest epidemic of sporotrichosis due to zoonotic transmission was reported in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil [18, 19, 21, 23, 28]; since then, the incidence of sporotrichosis among animals, particularly cats, has increased [8, 28, 29]. More than 4,000 humans and 4,124 cats were diagnosed at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia (INI) Evandro Chagas /Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz by 2012 [30]. Pereira et al. [29] observed that the majority of cats with sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro between 2005 and 2011 were male, mongrel, and unneutered, had a median age of 24 months, and presented with three or more cutaneous lesions in non-adjacent locations. This mycosis in cats is hard to treat and generally requires a long period of daily care; these animals do not always respond well to antifungal treatment [30].",

In cats, a broad spectrum of clinical presentation ranges from single lesions to fatal systemic forms. After monitoring the feline epidemic for 4 years, Schubach et al. [18] observed that the lymphocutaneous form occurred less frequently than did involvement of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and upper digestive tract and multiple cutaneous lesions.

Misdiagnosis results in ineffective treatment, which further worsens outcome. Major contributors toward misdiagnosis include the small number of affordable and effective treatment techniques as well as other social issues. Definitive diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis is based on mycological culture, micromorphological characterization, and mold-to-yeast conversion. Histopathological methods and cytopathological examination are useful tools for the presumptive diagnosis of Sporothrix infection in cats [40]. Detection of specific anti-Sporothrix antibodies offers a rapid alternative for accurate diagnosis [41\u201343]. We recently proposed a serological approach that employs an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to diagnose feline sporotrichosis [44] using purified antigen (the S. schenckii ConA binding fraction) and crude antigen, with high sensitivity and specificity.",

We found remarkable cross-reactivity among S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii antigens, and we identified an immunodominant molecule that is an important biomarker in feline sporotrichosis, irrespective of clinical manifestation. Here, we show that, although S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii may infect different warm-blooded hosts, infection result in highly similar IgG-mediated response in cats compared to humans, what is important for serodiagnosis and to the development of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine against the enormous health burden of sporotrichosis in endemic areas. This knowledge may enable selection of potential biomarkers that can be used in seroepidemiological studies, diagnosis, and vaccine development, and may contribute to understanding of the pathogenesis of this infection in cats and humans.",

After washing three times with PBST, diluted serum (1:800 in PBST, 100\u03bcL/well) was added in duplicate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterward, 100\u03bcL horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-feline IgG (1:1000; Southern Biotech) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After three washes with PBST, 100\u03bcL substrate solution (5 mg of o-phenylenediamine in 25 mL of 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer pH 5.0 plus 10 \u03bcL 30% H2O2) were added to each well, and the reaction was interrupted after 8 min in the dark by adding 50 \u03bcL 4 N H2SO4. Optical density was read at 492 nm with a Tecan Sunrise 96-well Microplate Reader (Tecan).",

Further, we previously proposed the existence of a convergent humoral response in human sporotrichosis against antigens from S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii, and S. globosa [45]. To establish whether S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii express different antigens, we assessed whole cellular protein extracts from two strains of S. brasiliensis plus two strains of S. schenckii s. str. that were previously characterized by molecular [8, 9, 25, 54] and serological [3, 44\u201347] methods. Remarkably, and in support of our hypothesis that immunological distance increases with phylogenetic distance, sera from these cats reacted similarly, with no significant differences in titer between ELISA plates coated with proteins from S. brasiliensis or S. schenckii (Fig 1).",

We also determined that this protein undergoes post-translational modification and is present as isoforms and glycoforms in the S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii proteomes [45]. We therefore investigated whether antibodies present in cat sera recognize all six isoforms in the S. brasiliensis proteome, as previously shown with human antibodies [45]. S. brasiliensis proteins were therefore resolved via 2D electrophoresis and immunoblotted with pooled sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 10) and optimal antibody titers according to ELISA. Serum-derived antibodies in naturally infected cats mainly recognized all six isoforms of gp60 (Fig 5). The present results confirm that S. brasiliensis 3-carboxymuconate cyclase is a highly polymorphic protein [45] with sizes of 55\u201362 kDa and with isoelectric points of 4.45\u20134.80. 2D immunoblotting revealed less diversity and more weakly reacting spots than 1D immunoblotting, perhaps due to protein loss during sample preparation for 2D electrophoresis (compared to the crude extracts used in 1D immunoblotting and ELISA) and serum dilution during pooling.",

Here, we demonstrated that antigens derived from yeast cell extracts of S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii s. str. yielded excellent results in ELISA and immunoblotting. The variety of molecules recognized by sera may be related to certain characteristics of the isolate, such as virulence, or even related to immune-system activation in each individual host. During infection, Sporothrix antigens elicit an IgG-mediated response; 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (gp60 in S. brasiliensis and gp70 in S. schenckii) is the immunodominant molecule in feline sporotrichosis, similar to murine and human disease. Therefore, this molecule may also be useful as a marker in the diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis and is a promising candidate for the development of therapeutic vaccines to tackle sporotrichosis in highly endemic areas.",
