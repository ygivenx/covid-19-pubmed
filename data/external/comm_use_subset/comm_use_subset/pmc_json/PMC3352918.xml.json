            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the causative agent of SARS, a life-threatening illness characterized by flu-like syndrome such as high fever, pneumonia, dyspnoea, infiltrates on chest radiography and sometimes respiratory failure [1]. The global spread of SARS caused hundreds of deaths and had enormous negative impact to the global economy in 2003\u20132004. SARS-CoV is a positive single-stranded (ss) RNA virus with one of the largest known RNA genomes (\u223c29.7 kb) [2], [3]. SARS-CoV gene expression involves poorly understood transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms. Following infection, there is translation of two large replicative polyproteins, the pp1a (the ORF1a polyprotein) and the pp1ab (the polyprotein made from the ORF1a and ORF1b through a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift during translation). These polyproteins are processed by the virus-encoded papain-like proteinase (PLpro; residing in nsp3) and nsp5, a 3C-like proteinase [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. This auto-proteolysis leads to formation of 16 non-structural proteins, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and an NTPase/helicase that are known as non-structural proteins 12 and 13, respectively (nsp12 and nsp13). These are likely to form the core of membrane-bound replication-transcription complexes in double-membrane vesicles at perinuclear regions [11]. Helicases are motor proteins that unwind double-stranded nucleic acids into two single-stranded nucleic acids by utilizing the energy derived from nucleotide hydrolysis [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Although, helicases were initially thought as molecular engines that unwind nucleic acids during replication, recombination, and DNA repair [16], recent reports have shown that they are also involved in other biological processes, including displacement of proteins from nucleic acid, movement of Holliday junctions, chromatin remodeling, catalysis of nucleic acid conformational changes [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], several aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcription, mRNA splicing, mRNA export, translation, RNA stability and mitochondrial gene expression [11]. Defects in helicase function have been associated with some human diseases, including Bloom's syndrome, Werner's syndrome, and Xeroderma Pigmentosum [26], [27], [28], [29]. The specific function of nsp13 in SARS-CoV replication has yet to be established. It is thought to interact with other SARS-CoV non-structural proteins, such as nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 [30], [31], [32] and probably contribute to the formation of a replication complex, but the effect of these interactions on nsp13 unwinding activity is unknown.",

Previously, basic biochemical characterization of nsp13 demonstrated that nsp13 can unwind both double-stranded DNA and RNA in a 5\u2032-3\u2032 direction, and it can hydrolyze all deoxyribonucleotide and ribonucleotide triphosphates [34], [35]. These studies were conducted using constructs of nsp13 that were fused with maltose binding protein (MBP-nsp13) and hexahistidine (H6-nsp13). Additional studies demonstrated that the amplitude of DNA unwinding by H6-nsp13 increases with longer 5\u2032-overhang containing DNA substrates [36]. These data advanced our understanding of nsp13 function [37], [38], but they do not address key mechanistic details such as the kinetic step size, rate of nucleic acid unwinding, and the ATP-coupling stoichiometry. Here, we present a minimal kinetic mechanism of nsp13.",

Hence, we prepared GST-nsp13 using a baculovirus expression system and this construct was primarily used to characterize in detail the kinetics of nucleic acid unwinding by SARS-CoV helicase, but we also carried out similar analyses with MBP-nsp13 and H6-nsp13 and compared them with GST-nsp13 to ensure that we were not measuring a GST-related artifact. We found that GST-nsp13 was significantly more active than the other variants and had activity comparable to other helicases [39]. In our enzyme characterization, we used both RNA and DNA substrates, as the biological role of SARS-CoV nsp13 is expected to be unwinding of RNA substrate. Moreover, we determined the effect of nsp12 on the mechanism of nsp13. Our data demonstrate that regardless of the type of fusion tag or substrate use, the helicase activity of nsp13 is enhanced in the presence of nsp12, suggesting that these proteins also interact in a functional replication complex and that their interaction contributes to the efficiency of viral replication. Our results allow mechanistic comparisons with other viral or eukaryotic helicases and set the stage for studying the intriguing evolutionary relations between helicases from nidoviruses and other groups of positive sense RNA viruses.",

The results presented in Figure 1 show that GST-nsp13 unwound half of the substrate in \u223c0.1 seconds. However, MBP-nsp13 and H6-nsp13 reached the same unwinding level at approximately 60 and 100 seconds, respectively. GST-nsp13 unwound the full amount of the nucleic acid in approximately 5 seconds, whereas it took more than 600 seconds for MBP-nsp13 and H6-nsp13 to achieve the same task. These results demonstrated that H6-nsp13 was the slowest of the three enzymes and that GST-nsp13 is faster than the other variants by up to three orders of magnitude. We also compared the ATPase activities of these three variants of nsp13. We determined ATP hydrolysis by measuring released Pi using thin-layer chromatography and obtained the initial rate constants by fitting the data to single exponential curves. The initial rate constants were then plotted against [ATP] and the data were fit to a hyperbolic function, yielding khydro(ATP) of 104.1\u00b14.0 s\u22121 for GST-nsp13 and 0.22\u00b10.006 s\u22121 for H6-nsp13 (Figure 2A and 2B). The MBP-nsp13 variant also showed similar rate of ATP hydrolysis as the H6-nsp13 (data not shown). Hence, most subsequent experiments for biochemical characterization were performed with GST-nsp13, and were generally repeated with H6-nsp13 and MBP-nsp13.",

None of the nsp13 variants could unwind substrates with 3\u2032-end single-strand overhang or blunt-end DNA and RNA duplexes [6], [34], [35]. However, we show here that nsp13 can unwind nucleic acid secondary structure elements (a stem-loop structure). This was shown using the 48/18-mer and 55/18-mer substrates (Figure S1), which mimic one of the stem loop structures present at the 5\u2032 UTR of SARS-CoV genome. These two substrates (48/18-mer and 55/18-mer) differed in the length of 5\u2032 single strand overhang before the loop (Figure 3B and Figure S1). The 55/18-mer substrate was readily unwound in contrast to the unwinding of 48/18-mer, which was only partially unwound suggesting that nsp13 can unwind stem loops provided the substrate has a 5\u2032-end overhang loading region (Figure 3B).",

The resulting fits are shown in Figure 4B and the kinetic parameters are listed in Table 1. Notably, the amplitude of product decreases as the length L\nT of the dsDNA substrate increases, consistent with a dissociation step as shown in Scheme 1 (Figure 1). The individual uncorrected kinetic step size for different lengths of dsDNA varied from 14.3 to 16.4 as the length of dsDNA region decreased from 60 to 18 bp. Previous studies have shown that the last 8\u201310 bp of dsDNA can melt spontaneously in the presence of an active helicase[38]. Thus, it is essential to take into consideration the length of dsDNA that spontaneously melts when calculating the kinetic step size rather than using the full length of dsDNA. Hence, the value L\n0 used in Table 2 and equation 7 was set to 10 bp.",

            "text": "Previous reports have shown that several DNA and RNA helicases interact with their corresponding polymerases. These interactions generally enhance the unwinding activity of helicases [49], [50], [51]. Evidence from yeast-two-hybrid experiments suggested that SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12) interacts with nsp13 [31]. To investigate if nsp12 affects the helicase activity of nsp13 we monitored the unwinding of the 80/60-mer DNA substrates (5 nM) by GST-nsp13 (100 nM) in the presence of nsp12 (0 nM, 250 nM, and 500 nM) under conditions described in \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019. The results showed that 500 nM nsp12 clearly enhanced the unwinding rate (mkU, base-pairs per second) of nsp13 by \u223c2-fold (Figure 5 and Table 3). This enhancement is accompanied by a change in the step size from 7.9 to 14.3 for this specific substrate (Table 3) demonstrating that the presence of nsp12 can change the rate and the mechanism of helicase activity. 500 nM of nsp12 was used because optimal unwinding of nucleic acid by nsp13 in the presence of nsp12 was observed at this concentration (Figure S3). Also, the effect of nsp12 on the ATPase activity of nsp13 was examined, and no enhancement of the ATPase activity was observed (data not shown).Our data suggest that this enhancement is independent of the type of substrate (dsDNA vs. dsRNA) or protein tag (GST vs. H6). A similar effect was observed when H6-nsp13 helicase activity was monitored in the presence of nsp12. The rate of unwinding the shorter 31/18-mer RNA substrate increased from 0.3\u00b10.02 to 1.5\u00b10.15 (mkU, base-pairs per second) and the rate of unwinding 31/18-mer DNA increased from 0.7\u00b10.05 to 1.8\u00b10.07 (mkU, base-pairs per second) (Figures 6C,6D and Table 4) with minimal change in the amplitude. However, the effect on the amplitude is more significant with the substrate with longer duplex region, 80/60-mer DNA substrate (Figure 5). Using the same 31/18-mer substrates, GST-nsp13 exhibited similar helicase activity enhancement as H6-nsp13 (Figures 6A, 6B, and Table 4). Notably, this enhancement is specific, as it was not observed when the nsp12 SARS RdRp was substituted with the foot-and-mouth disease virus RdRp (FMDV 3Dpol) (Figures 6A, 6B, and Table 4).",

To determine whether nsp13 is indeed a \u2018slow\u2019 enzyme, we prepared a GST-nsp13 construct and expressed it in a bacterial and baculovirus expression systems. GST-nsp13 protein expressed in bacterial systems was insoluble, whereas when expressed in a baculovirus expression system it was highly soluble (Figure S2). GST-nsp13 expressed in baculovirus displayed much higher unwinding and ATPase activities than the H6- or MBP-tagged proteins (Figure 1 and Figure 2). This enzyme showed same polarity as reported before for two other variants of nsp13 [34], [35]. GST-nsp13 requires at least a five nucleotide 5\u2032-end single strand overhang for efficient unwinding similar to human coronavirus 229E helicase [52]. GST-nsp13 can unwind secondary structures of nucleic acid (such as those present in viral genome) as long as a sufficient 5\u2032 single strand overhang is available. Unlike MBP-nsp13 and H6-nsp13, GST-nsp13 has a helicase activity comparable to other viral, bacterial and eukaryotic helicases. We and others have been unable to hydrolytically remove the affinity tags from nsp13 [34], [35] presumably because the engineered cleavage site is not easily accessible to the protease. Notably, exogenously added GST did not have any effect on the rate of nucleic acid unwinding by both H6-nsp13 (Figures 6C and 6D) and MBP-nsp13 (data not shown), suggesting that the higher activity of GST-nsp13 is not a result of a GST artifact. It is not clear why GST-nsp13 is more active than H6-nsp13. The two proteins appear to have comparable affinities for dsDNA as seen in gel shift experiments (results not shown). Comparison of the ATP hydrolysis rate by GST-nsp13 and H6-nsp13 showed that H6-nsp13 hydrolyzes ATP slower than GST-nsp13. Hence, based on these experiments we decided to biochemically characterize the GST-nsp13 enzyme, although most of the experiments were also carried out with H6-nsp13.",

The enhancement of nsp13 activity in the presence of nsp12 is specific as it does not occur in the presence of another RdRp, such as FMDV 3Dpol. Moreover, it was observed not only for GST-nsp13, but also for the H6-nsp13 (Figures 6C and 6D) and MBP-nsp13 (data not shown), demonstrating that it is not an artifact of the fusion tag. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a nidovirus RNA helicase activity enhancement by an RdRp. The synergy between the two enzymes is likely to be important for coronavirus replication, as is the case in other bacterial, mitochondrial, bacteriophage DNA- or viral RNA- replication systems. In these cases, the DNA polymerase [49], [51], [57], [58], [59] or the RNA polymerase [60] were reported to enhance unwinding by the corresponding helicase.",

            "text": "Interestingly, nsp12 translocates on the template strand in a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 direction during RNA synthesis. On the other hand, unlike pestivirus or flavivirus helicases, SARS-CoV nsp13 binds a 5\u2032 overhang and moves 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 to unwind double stranded RNA [34], [35]. Despite the fact that the enzymatic functions of nsp13 and nsp12 have opposite polarities (5\u2032-3\u2032 vs 3\u2032-5\u2032 of the template strand)nsp12 and nsp13 may work together to carry out the following RC functions: 1) Synthesis of subgenomic transcripts containing the leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032end of the genome [34], [35]. To accomplish this, nsp12 would have to copy RNA in a 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 template direction, followed by pausing at transcription regulatory element sites. Such pauses may trigger motion in the opposite direction allowing nsp13 (aided by nsp12 and possibly other viral and host proteins) to unwind the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA primer and facilitate transfer to the complementary region of the 5\u2032-leader genomic sequence [34], [35]. 2) Data in Figure 3B suggest that nsp13 is capable of disrupting secondary structures of nucleic acid, only when they can be accessed by an upstream 5\u2032-single stranded region. Hence, stem-loop \u201croadblocks\u201d are likely to be cleared by RCs that approach the stem loop from the 5\u2032 ssRNA direction. Ongoing biochemical experiments focus on characterizing RC functions that involve nsp13.",

The PCR amplicons were digested with BamH I and XhoI followed by ligation into expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). After confirming the amplicon nucleotide sequences we used the flanking RsrII and XhoI restriction sites to subclone GST-nsp13 into the pFASTBAC1 vector (Invitrogen). In the final pFASTBAC1-GST-nsp13 construct, GST was fused at the N-terminus of nsp13. This plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH10Bac cells for transposition of GST-nsp13 from pFASTBAC1 into a bacmid, which is a baculovirus shuttle vector with a baculovirus-specific promoter (i.e, the polyhedrin or p10 promoter). The bacmid was propagated in E. coli DH10Bac as a large plasmid that confers resistance to kanamycin and can complement a lacZ deletion present on the chromosome to form blue (Lac+) colonies in the presence of a chromogenic substrate such as Blue-gal or X-gal and the inducer IPTG. Insertion of GST-nsp13 into the bacmid disrupted expression of lacZ\u03b1, allowing the selection of GST-nsp13-containing bacmids (white colonies) and isolation of DNA using the High Purelink DNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Following confirmation of GST-nsp13 gene insertion in the bacmid, the recombinant bacmid was then transfected into HighFive Insect cells using cellfectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 72 hrs we harvested supernatants containing the 1st recombinant baculovirus stock (P1). In order to amplify the viral stock, the harvested P1 was used to infect fresh HighFive Insect cells at an MOI of 0.1 and the supernatant was collected 48 hrs post-infection. This resulted in 100-fold amplification of the virus (P2). The P2 stock was subsequently used to infect fresh monolayer cultured HighFive insect cells for GST-nsp13 expression. After 48 hrs, cells were harvested and resuspended in the \u201cBinding Buffer\u201d (137 mM NaCl, 1.94 mM K3PO4, 8.06 mM Na3PO4, and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4; phosphate buffered saline). The cells were lysed by sonication and the lysate was passed through Glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed with 20 column volumes of Binding Buffer followed by elution of GST-nsp13 using 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE and purified GST-nsp13 was visualized by Coomassie-Brilliant Blue staining as 92-kDa protein product, in line with the expected mass of the fusion protein. The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein (\u223c95% pure) was stored at \u221280\u00b0C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 5% glycerol.
