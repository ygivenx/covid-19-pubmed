            "text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established treatment of various haematological malignancies and certain congenital metabolic disorders. The chance of finding a human leucocyte antigen- (HLA-) identical donor-recipient pair amongst siblings is only one in four. Therefore, stem cells from unrelated donors are most frequently used for transplantation [1]. However, these transplants are associated with significant risks of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), graft failure, and transplant related mortality [2]. The magnitude of permissivity of a given class I allotype is found to depend on the position of mismatched amino acids (AA) within the class I heavy chain (hc) and nature of the exchanged AA and also of the neighbouring AAs [3]. The mismatched AA might impact the peptides that are selected and presented by these individual class I allotypes and also alter the conformation of these peptide-HLA (pHLA) complexes [4\u20137]. Previous studies have shown that even a single AA exchange occurring at key residues within the peptide binding groove can strongly influence the features of bound peptides [8] and result in severe incompatibility [9]. It is therefore of crucial importance to determine the most acceptable mismatch when no identical matched donor is available. This can be achieved by conducting a systematic study to understand the effect of AA polymorphisms occurring in HLA class I molecules.",

For its efficient cell surface expression, the class I hc must associate with beta-2-microglobulin (b2m) and cytosolically derived peptides within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a process involving several components of the peptide loading complex (PLC) [11]. Calnexin assists in proper folding of class I hc prior to its association with b2m and thereafter with the chaperon calreticulin (CRT) [10]. The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) facilitates the import of proteasomally processed peptides from cytosol into the ER [12]. The transmembrane glycoprotein tapasin (TPN) functions within the PLC as a stable disulphide linked heterodimer along with ERp57 [13]. TPN bridges the CRT-class I/b2m complex to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) [14], thereby facilitating peptide loading. Additionally, TPN is also found to increase the steady state levels of TAP [10] and help in the optimization and loading of high affinity peptides.",

Most of the HLA class I allotypes such as HLA-B8 [17], HLA-B*44:02 [17, 20], and HLA- B*15:10 [18] are highly dependent upon TPN for peptide loading and antigen presentation [17, 21]. Other alleles such as HLA-B*27:05 [17], HLA-B*44:05 [16], HLA-B*15:01, and HLA-B*15:18 [18] were shown to load peptides without TPN, though most of these allotypes associate with the PLC and make use of TPN when present [16, 17, 22]. We recently described position 156 located at the centre of the \u03b12 helix within the HLA class I hc to be an important determinant for its association with TPN. The great impact of position 156 on HLA function is reflected by its large HLA class I polymorphism and its influence in peptide binding. By structural analysis residue 156 could be described to contact position 3 of a bound peptide in almost all structures (>70%) and position 4, 5, 6, or 7 in 5\u201370% of peptide-HLA structures available [8]. Even a single mismatch at position 156 can result in transplant rejection [9, 23] and acute GvHD for HLA-B*44 allotypes [24]. Structural involvement of position 156 in influencing the conformation of PBR was demonstrated by comparing the crystal structures of HLA-B*44:02156Asp and B*44:03156Leu complexed with the same, natural high affinity ligand [25]. Recently, we described the effect of single AA polymorphisms at position 156 on TPN dependency for HLA-B*44 allotypes for optimal peptide loading and cell surface expression. Our results illustrated that TPN independent peptide loading resulted in the presentation of exclusive set of peptides with distinct features and lengths [6]. TPN independent alleles are able to load and present peptides via a nonclassical peptide loading pathway and for that reason TPN independent alleles should be able to overcome virus escape mechanism of blocking TPN and might be able to present viral peptides. TPN independence offers flexibility on one hand, because it provides an effective pathogen evasion; however peptides are loaded suboptimally and that might influence the immunogenicity and half-life time of pHLA complexes and this might result in autoimmunity.",

Since HLA-A*24:02 was described to process and present the immediate early-1 antigen (IE-1) derived peptides of HCMV [26], it becomes obvious that HLA-A*24:02 is able to load peptides independently of the PLC; however the presentation of viral peptides seems to be orchestrated by the interaction of HLA and HCMV immune evasions [27]. Peptides from IE-1 are found to be presented 6 hours after infection, though it has been shown that the presentation of different IE1 epitopes is suppressed strongly after infection with US2/US11-competent strains, but not after infection with US2/US11-deleted viral strains (between 1 and 91 hours after infection). The deletion of US2, US6, and US11 enabled the HLA molecules to restore the presentation of IE-1 peptides to CTLs [28]. However, US3 deletion had no effect on IE-1 suppression, suggesting that the increased retention times of HLA class I molecules in the ER by US3 in TPN dependent allotypes results in the exchange of IE-1 peptides with higher affinity self-peptides. However, given that HLA-A*24/156 allotypes are independent of TPN for cell surface expression, they might have very less ER retention time and might facilitate the export of HLA-A*24 molecules loaded with IE-1 peptides to the cell surface during HCMV infection.",

To investigate the structural basis of this TPN dependency in HLA-A*24 alleles we generated molecular models using the structure of HLA-A*24:02156Gln as a template and mutating residue 156 to HLA-A*24:06156Trp or HLA-A*24:13156Leu (Figure 8). To predict the magnitude of the HLA-A*24:06156Trp or HLA-A*24:13156Leu polymorphisms on the protein structure we used the Site Directed Mutator (SDM) server (http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/sdm/sdm.php) [34]. The SDM server calculates a stability score that is based upon environment-dependent AA substitution and propensity tables derived from homologous protein families. The stability score (Pseudo \u0394\u0394G) is negative when a mutation is destabilizing while a positive score indicates that a particular mutation is stabilizing thereby allowing us to predict the effect that a particular mutation will have on the stability of proteins. The HLA-A*24:06156Trp or HLA-A*24:13156Leu polymorphisms both illustrated high stability score values of 2.37 and 3.11, respectively, suggesting that they have increased stability. To confirm the predicted increase in stability we also calculated the predicted difference in free energies between wild type and mutant proteins (\u0394\u0394G values) using FoldX [35]. Again the HLA-A*24:06156Trp or HLA-A*24:13156Leu polymorphisms both illustrated \u0394\u0394G values of \u22120.18 and \u22121.44, respectively, consistent with increased stability and suggesting that these mutations are likely to provide enhanced TPN independence through generating an energetically stable and a more peptide receptive environment.",

A key component of the PLC is the protein TPN that orchestrates peptide selection by facilitating the stabilization of TAP and promoting the binding and translocation of peptides by TAP. The absence of TPN abrogates the binding of class I molecules to TAP and results in unstable pHLA complexes with short half-life times making it one of the main targets for viruses to interfere with the presentation of viral peptides to CTLs. Despite its dedicated function certain HLA alleles are able to circumvent the PLC and can therefore present an alternate repertoire of peptides due to their PLC independence. These TPN independent alleles are therefore advantageous in viral infections such as hepatitis C (HCV) [37] or HIV [38].",

Since TPN independence might permit distinct alleles to present poorly tolerated self-peptides to the self-immune sytem, a probability of autoimmune reactions should be considered. In the view of this context, it becomes interesting that HLA-A*24:02 is found to be a predisposing factor for type 1 diabetes [39] and proliferative diabetic retinopathy [40]. TPN-independency might also permit certain HLA variants to present viral antigens during an infection. HCMV infected human fibroblasts were found to naturally process and present the immediate early-1 antigen derived peptides on HLA-A*24:02 [26]. Given the implication of HLA-A*24:02 with autoimmune disorders and its ability to present viral peptides, we wanted to investigate if polymorphisms occurring at position 156 influence PLC dependence, structure and property of the PBR, and subsequently peptide features and repertoire presented by these allotypes.",

The peptide binding motifs at p2 and p\u2126 for A*24/156 derived peptides show in the absence of TPN high promiscuity, particularly the low binding peptides (Figures 6 and 7). Remarkably more peptides, particularly low binding peptides, of unusual length have been selected and presented in the absence of TPN (Figure 5), suggesting presentation of nonoptimized ligands with unusual length during a viral infection or downregulation of PLC components. Both A*24:06 and A*24:13 showed high levels of surface expression (~75%) in the absence of TPN, while A*24:02 exhibited partial independence.

Lysates from HLA-A*24 transduced 721.221 cells were immunoprecipitated with TAP1 (Figure 3(a)) or with PaSta-1 (anti-TPN) antibody (Figure 3(b)). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes that were probed with antibody against HLA-A heavy chain, CRT, ERp57, TPN, and TAP1. All the 3 HLA-A*24/156 variants showed similar levels of association with TPN in 721.221 cells indicating that they make use of TPN when it is present (Figure 3(b)). HLA-A*24/156 variants showed strong associations with TAP1 in 221 cells (Figure 3(a)). They were weakly associated with TAP1 in 220 cells lacking functional TPN. Lysate controls showed decreased steady state TAP1 levels in 220 cells compared to 221 cells (Figure 3(c)). Lysate controls showed similar levels of HLA-A24, CRT, and ERp57 in all the transduced 721.220 and 721.221 cells (Figure 3(c)) and similar levels of TPN in all the transduced 721.221 cells.",
