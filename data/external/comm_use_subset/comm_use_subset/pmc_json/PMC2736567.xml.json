            "text": "Viruses need to interact with host macromolecules to hijack the cellular machinery and replicate. These interactions are essential for viruses to target endocytic pathways and penetrate host cells, to recruit cellular transcription and/or translation machinery, and to achieve intracellular migration and viral particles assembly. But viruses also encode virulence factors that induce a substantial alteration of host cell functions and genetic programs to increase virus replication and spreading. For example, specific viral factors stimulate survival pathways to prevent apoptosis of infected cells or inhibit cell signaling involved in immune response. Among these pathways, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling represents a prime target for viruses because of its critical role in the induction of both innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses [1]. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 transduce signals through direct binding to a cell surface receptor composed of two transmembrane subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c [2]. This interaction activates IFNAR1/IFNAR2c associated kinases Tyk2 and Jak1 that subsequently phosphorylate STAT2 and STAT1 transcription factors. Activated STAT1 and STAT2, altogether with IRF9, form the Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3 that binds IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter sequences to induce a large antiviral gene cluster. As a consequence, most viruses that are pathogenic in vertebrates have evolved virulence factors both to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression and signal transduction downstream of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor.",

These viruses are responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and colds, but often spread to the lower respiratory tract causing bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children and immuno-compromised patients. hPIV3 infection is also suspected to exacerbate chronic airway inflammatory diseases like asthma [4]. Sendai virus and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (bPIV3) are animal counterparts of hPIV1 and hPIV3 that infect mouse and cattle, respectively. Respirovirus genome is a single-strand, negative-sense RNA molecule that encodes six structural proteins (Mononegavirales order). While hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) are membrane glycoproteins associated with the envelop of hPIV3 particles, the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P) and the viral polymerase (L) form the ribonucleocapsid complex.

            "text": "The P gene of Respirovirus encodes for P but also for a panel of accessory proteins by site-specific editing of P mRNA and usage of overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). In all Respirovirus except hPIV1, the co-transcriptional insertion of one G residue at an editing motif midway of P mRNA leads to the expression of a chimeric protein called V. The V proteins of bPIV3 and Sendai virus bind MDA5 and suppress double-stranded RNA-stimulated IFN-\u03b2 production, thereby contributing to the virus evasion of host immune response [5]. Surprisingly in hPIV3, multiple stop codons localized downstream of the editing site prevent the normal expression of a full-length V protein. As a result, P mRNA molecules edited by the addition of one G residue encode for the 242 amino acid (AA)-long N-terminal residues of P followed by only six additional AA (see Materials and Methods and [6]). But P mRNA molecules edited by the addition of five G residues encode for D, a protein exhibiting a large and specific C-terminal domain of unknown function (Figure 1A). Besides co-transcriptional edition, an overlapping ORF embedded in the first half of the P mRNA allows the expression of a single C protein (hPIV3 and bPIV3) or a nested set of four proteins called C\u2032, C, Y1 and Y2 (Sendai virus and hPIV1). The C proteins of Sendai virus and hPIV1 have a high degree of sequence homology and have been studied in details. They are involved in the regulation of viral RNA synthesis [7],[8], the inhibition of innate immune response [9] and potentially contribute to the budding of viral particles [10]\u2013[12]. In particular, the C protein of Sendai virus both inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production [13],[14] and blocks interferon signaling downstream of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 receptors [15]\u2013[17]. The C proteins of hPIV3 and bPIV3 only share \u223c35% of sequence homology with the C proteins of Sendai virus and hPIV1, but they have also been shown to target interferon expression and signaling [5],[18]. Although expression of the C protein of hPIV3 (hPIV3-C) is essential to virulence in vitro and in vivo\n[19] and explains hPIV3 ability to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling [20], host proteins that bind hPIV3-C remain unknown.",

            "text": "In an attempt to answer this question, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and we report here the identification of STAT1 and GRB2 as direct interactors of hPIV3-C. Although binding to STAT1 accounts for hPIV3-C ability to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, the interaction with GRB2 was unexpected. This adaptor protein bridges growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), like Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor, to the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway. Upon engagement by their ligands, RTKs autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues to recruit adaptor proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) or Src homology 2 (SH2) domains like GRB2 [21]. Once associated to RTKs by its SH2 domain, GRB2 recruits the guanine nucleotide-releasing factor son-of-sevenless (SOS) to activate Ras. Downstream events include MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK1/2) activation, which in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2. Finally, phosphorylated ERK1/2 directly or indirectly activates numerous cellular targets including transcription factors (e.g. Elk1, SAP1, SAP2, c-Fos, CREB, SRF) but also cellular factors that control mRNA translation like eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) or small ribosomal subunit S6 protein [22],[23]. Growth factor binding to RTKs regulates a multiplicity of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and survival. In the respiratory tract, this signaling cascade has been shown to trigger inflammation and mucus secretion by epithelial cells [24]\u2013[27], suggesting a critical role in innate immunity [28]. However, excessive activation of this pathway could benefit to virus replication by inhibiting IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling [29] and promoting infected cell survival [25]. Altogether, these data provided a rational to investigate the functional impact of hPIV3-C expression on IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 vs EGF receptor and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways.",

            "text": "To identify cellular targets of hPIV3-C, this viral protein was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human cDNA library. The screen was performed at saturation with a 10-fold coverage of the library (50.10+6 diploids), and positive yeast colonies growing on selective medium were analyzed by PCR and sequencing to identify binding partners of hPIV3-C. STAT1 and GRB2 were the main interactors of hPIV3-C identified in the screen with 5 and 150 yeast colonies corresponding to these cellular proteins, respectively. In both cases, cDNA clones retrieved from the screen corresponded to full-length STAT1 and GRB2 in frame with the Gal4-AD transactivation domain. To validate these interactions in human cells, GST-tagged hPIV3-C was expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified with glutathion-sepharose beads. As shown in Figure 1B and 1C, endogenous STAT1 and GRB2 co-purified with hPIV3-C. Highly divergent C proteins from measles virus (MV-C) and Nipah virus (Nipah-C) failed to do so, thereby demonstrating the specificity of identified interactions. Binding to STAT1 provides molecular basis to the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling by hPIV3-C [18], and parallels the interaction previously identified between Sendai virus C protein and mouse STAT1 [15]. Altogether, this suggests that STAT1 is a specific cellular interactor of Respirovirus C proteins. In contrast, binding to GRB2 is unexpected and suggests a new function for hPIV3-C that we decided to investigate.",

            "text": "The adaptor protein GRB2 plays a critical role in coupling signal from growth factor receptors to MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. To address the question of hPIV3-C interference with this pathway, we used a trans-reporter gene assay that measures Elk1 activation by ERK1/2. In this system, Elk1 transcription factor is fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4-DB) and binds the promoter sequence of a luciferase reporter gene. Upon stimulation with a growth factor like EGF, Elk1 is activated as assessed by a significant increase in luciferase expression. Surprisingly, we observed a 6-fold enhancement in this cellular response to EGF when 3\u00d7FLAG-tagged hPIV3-C was expressed in HEK-293T cells (Figure 2A). Same results were obtained when using hPIV3-C without a tag (14-fold enhancement) or tagged with the red fluorescent protein Cherry (7-fold enhancement). In contrast to hPIV3-C, neither MV-C nor Nipah-C enhanced Elk1 activity upon EGF stimulation (Figure 2A) whereas expression levels of hPIV3-C, MV-C and Nipah-C were similar in this system (Figure 2F, left panel). Elk1 activity was also enhanced by hPIV3-C expression in Vero and Hela cells as well as BEAS-2B and A549, two epithelial cell lines that originate from the respiratory tract, which is the tissue targeted by hPIV3 in vivo (Table 1). The effect of hPIV3-C in these different cell lines was highly significant (see p-values in Table 1) although relatively modest when compared to HEK-293T cells. This is probably because our reporter system requires the co-transfection of four plasmids and Vero, Hela, BEAS-2B and A549 cells are more difficult to transfect than HEK-293T. In parallel experiments, cellular response to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 was monitored using a cis-reporter gene, of which expression is controlled by five ISREs. As previously reported [18], we found that hPIV3-C efficiently blocked IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling (Figure 2B) as opposed to what we observed for the EGF pathway. Again, MV-C or Nipah-C was unable to do so. Altogether, these results show that hPIV3-C enhances the cellular response to EGF in addition to its ability to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling.",

As shown in Figure 2D, Elk1 activation was blocked by U0126, whereas hPIV3-C expression was maintained (Figure 2F, right panel). This demonstrates that hPIV3-C is acting through ERK1/2 stimulation.

Interestingly, hPIV3 infection of A549 cells also enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation but the induction profile was different. Indeed, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not significantly increased at the peak of induction, but the signal was boosted by hPIV3 infection at late time points (Figure S1). The same profile was observed when eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation levels were analyzed in infected HEK-293T cells. hPIV3 infection sustained the phosphorylation of these two translation factors at late time points, but showed no increase at the peak of stimulation, i.e. 30 min after adding EGF to the cells (Figure 3D).

To test if the same was true for hPIV3, cells were treated for 2 h with MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 and infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 1). Two days after infection, cell surface expression of hPIV3-HN was detected by immunostaining and flow cytometry. U0126 completely blocked the expression of hPIV3-HN in hPIV3-infected cells (Figure 4), whereas the same inhibitor had no effect when cells were infected with MV (Figure S2).

To do so, we generated by PCR a full matrix of hPIV3-C overlapping fragments and tested their ability to interact with either STAT1 or GRB2 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Figure 5 and 6). Both forward and reverse primers were designed every 75 nucleotides along hPIV3-C sequence and fused to appropriate tails to allow gap-repair recombination with linearized Gal4-DB yeast two-hybrid vector (Figure 5A). All possible combinations of forward and reverse primers were used to amplify hPIV3-C fragments. Finally, corresponding PCR products were transformed in a yeast strain expressing Gal4-AD fused to either STAT1 or GRB2, and growth on selective medium was used to detect potential interactions. A 124 (AA)-long peptide encompassing position 76 to 199 located in the C-terminal half of hPIV3-C was sufficient to bind STAT1 (Figure 5B) or GRB2 (Figure 6A). In an iterative process, we then generated a second, a third and a fourth set of hPIV3-C fragments corresponding to one-by-one AA deletions (Figure 5C\u2013E and Figure 6B\u2013D), allowing to further reduce the STAT1 and GRB2 binding motifs to minimal peptides. A 106 AA peptide encompassing residues 90 to 195 of hPIV3-C was sufficient to observe the interaction with STAT1 (Figure 5E). The binding region to GRB2 was virtually the same, encompassing AA 97 to 195 (Figure 6D).",

Furthermore, virtually the same C-terminal region of Sendai virus C protein (AA 85-204) was previously reported to mediate the interaction with mouse STAT1 [32]. To further validate our observations performed in the yeast two-hybrid system, we retested by co-affinity purification the ability of hPIV3-C fragment encompassing AA 90-195 (hPIV3-C90-195) to interact with STAT1 and GRB2 in HEK-293T cells. GST-tagged hPIV3-C90-195 was expressed together with 3\u00d7-FLAG-tagged STAT1 or GRB2, and purified with glutathion-sepharose beads. Full-length hPIV3-C and the N-terminal region encompassing AA 1-89 (hPIV3-C1-89) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in Figure 7B and 7C, hPIV3-C90-195 interacted with STAT1 and GRB2, whereas hPIV3-C1-89 did not. Although hPIV3-C90-195 interacted with GRB2 as efficiently as full-length hPIV3-C (Figure 7C), interaction with STAT1 was weaker suggesting that more residues contribute to the stabilization of this interaction (Figure 7B). Altogether, these results confirm that AA 90-195 of hPIV-3 include both STAT1 and GRB2 binding sites.",

To answer this question, a competition experiment was designed where GST-tagged hPIV3-C was co-expressed with STAT1 in the presence or absence of GRB2 (Figure 7D). In this setting, GRB2 expression prevents STAT1 co-purification together with GST-tagged hPIV3-C. This validates our finding that STAT1 and GRB2 interact with the same region of hPIV3-C, and demonstrates that STAT1 and GRB2 compete for hPIV3-C binding. Interestingly, GRB2 interaction with hPIV3-C was not affected by STAT1 expression (Figure 7D and data not shown), suggesting that GRB2 has a higher affinity for hPIV3-C than STAT1.",

Reporter gene expression was determined 24 h post transfection and found to be inhibited exclusively by full-length hPIV3-C (Figure 8A). Although this may reflect the weakness of hPIV3-C interaction with STAT1 (Figure 7B), this also indicates that both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of hPIV3-C are required to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, even if only the C-terminal region is required for the binding to STAT1. The same constructs were tested using the Elk1 activity reporter plasmids (Figure 8B). Again, only full-length hPIV3-C was able to enhance Elk1 activation upon EGF stimulation whereas full-length hPIV3-C and hPIV3-C90-195 were expressed at similar levels in transfected cells (Figure 8B, upper right panel).",

            "text": "\nParamyxoviridae have evolved various mechanisms to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response, in particular signaling downstream IFNAR1/IFNAR2c receptor [20],[33]. Although members of Pneumovirinae subfamily have specific genes to encode inhibitors of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling pathway, those expressed by other Paramyxoviridae (i.e. Paramyxovirinae subfamily) are encoded by overlapping reading frames embedded within the gene P. Rubulaviruses express V proteins that target STAT1 and/or STAT2 for ubiquitination and degradation, while Morbilliviruses and Henipaviruses V proteins essentially impair STAT1/2 phosphorylation, activation and nuclear translocation. In addition, Morbilliviruses and Henipaviruses also encode for C proteins of which role in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response has been a matter of debates [34]\u2013[37]. Recent reports showed that Morbillivirus C proteins only have a minor role in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling [37], but are essential to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction [38]. Whether Henipavirus C proteins can directly block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or promote viral replication through alternative mechanisms is unclear [35]. In contrast, it has been clearly established that Respirovirus C proteins are potent inhibitors of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling [5], [18], [39]\u2013[41]. In this report, we show that hPIV3-C, but not MV-C or Nipah-C, directly interacts with STAT1 and efficiently inhibits IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling. In addition, we identified a minimal STAT1 binding domain that encompasses AA 90-195 of hPIV3-C, a region suspected to fold into a coiled coil. Interestingly, this conserved domain is localized within the STAT1 binding region shared by all four isoforms of Sendai virus C protein [32]. Together, these results confirm the capacity of hPIV3-C to block IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling pathway [18], provide molecular basis to this inhibition and clarify the fact that Respirovirus C proteins are functionally distinct from Morbillivirus and Henipavirus C proteins.",

Our data give the first example of a Paramyxoviridae protein that contributes to the stimulation of EGFR and MAPK/ERK pathway and provides molecular basis to this activity. This pathway has been known for decades as a prime target of DNA tumor viruses and oncogenic retroviruses, and its activation represents an essential step toward carcinogenesis [3],[42]. But recent data demonstrate that non-oncogenic RNA viruses also activate this signaling cascade to support viral replication and spreading [31]. Whether it is activated upon EGFR engagement or other means, MAPK/ERK pathway regulates a multiplicity of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, development, cell survival and inflammation. As a consequence, how the activation of MAPK/ERK pathway promotes viral replication is a complex question. Interestingly, two non-oncogenic RNA viruses associated with acute respiratory tract infections have been recently reported to modulate the EGFR pathway. Both human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), a member of Paramyxoviridae like hPIV3, and a rhinovirus that belongs to Picornaviridae family activate EGFR and MAPK/ERK pathway [25],[27]. Infection of epithelial cells by these viruses stimulates the processing and activation of EGFR ligands by membrane matrix metalloproteinase and subsequent engagement of EGFR through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. Experiments performed on rhinovirus show that viral replication and TLR3 engagement by viral RNA are both required to activate the EGFR and MAPK/ERK pathway [27]. In this report, we show that hPIV3 infection also activates MAPK/ERK pathway in the absence of external stimuli, a phenomenon that possibly relies on the engagement of pathogen recognition receptors. Although hPIV3-C alone is unable to activate this pathway, our data suggest that expression of this virulence factor enhances MAPK/ERK activation above normal level in infected cells, thereby contributing to viral replication and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Induction of MAPK/ERK pathway by RNA viruses has numerous consequences on cell biology. First, it results in increased expression of inflammatory factors, in particular cytokines and chemokines that recruit cellular effectors of immunity [27], [43]\u2013[47]. MAPK/ERK pathway was also reported to block the antiviral response induced by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, making its activation beneficial to virus replication [29]. Another consequence of MAPK/ERK pathway activation is the induction of mucin production by infected epithelial cells [24],[27]. Although mucin expression is a critical innate defense system, excessive production of mucus results in the obstruction of airways and delays the elimination of pathogens. Finally, it has been demonstrated in vitro that upon hRSV infection, activation of EGFR and MAPK/ERK pathway sustains viral replication by retarding the death of infected cells [25]. Altogether, these data suggest that although a moderate activation of MAPK/ERK pathway contributes to the innate response against viruses, an excessive activation leads to deleterious inflammation, inhibition of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response, airway obstruction and infected cell survival [28]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that hPIV3-C interaction with GRB2 and EGFR pathway participates in such deregulation of airway epithelium homeostasis to promote hPIV3 replication and spreading. A consequence of such perturbations could be an aggravation of chronic inflammatory airway diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as already suggested by epidemiological links with Paramyxoviridae infections and in vivo models [48],[49].",

It is now well documented that MAPK/ERK pathway inhibition with U0126 or PD098059 deeply impairs the replication of numerous RNA viruses including hRSV ([50]; and for review see [31]). Similarly, we show in this report that MAPK/ERK pathway inhibition prevents hPIV3 protein expression in infected cells as assessed by hPIV3-HN detection. In influenza virus infected cells, membrane accumulation of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) induces lipid-rafts clustering that leads to MAPK/ERK pathway activation and nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes to achieve viral particles assembly [51]\u2013[53]. Because hPIV3 replication cycle is only cytoplasmic, mechanisms involved are necessarily distinct. A possible link between MAPK/ERK pathway and hPIV3 protein expression lies in the fact that among downstream targets of this pathway are essential factors of cellular translational machinery.",

            "text": "We show that hPIV3-C expression enhances the phosphorylation of S6 and eIF4E. The small ribosomal subunit protein S6 is the major phosphoprotein of eukaryotic ribosomes with five phosphorylation sites (Ser235, Ser236, Ser240, Ser244, and Ser247). Two families of serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate S6 in vitro: S6K1/2 and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). Recently it has been shown that MAPK/ERK signaling pathway activates RSK family members that contribute to S6 phosphorylation on Ser235/236 thereby stimulating cap-dependent translation [23]. In addition, eIF4E that interacts with the cap structure and brings translation initiation factors together with the small ribosomal subunit via the scaffold protein eIF4G, undergoes regulated phosphorylation on Ser209 upon MAPK/ERK pathway activation. This phosphorylation event is dependent on eIF4G-associated MAPK signal-integrating kinases, Mnk1 and Mnk2 [22]. eIF4E is believed to be the least abundant of all initiation factors and therefore considered as a perfect target to regulate protein synthesis. Even though there is no direct link between eIF4E phosphorylation and the enhanced translation observed, the fraction of phosphorylated eIF4E dramatically increases following treatment of the cells with growth factors, hormones and mitogens. Therefore, eIF4E phosphorylation has been associated with increased translation rates. hPIV3 mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated like their host counterparts. Thus, S6 and eIF4E phosphorylation together with a high level of viral gene transcription may contribute to a rapid switch toward viral protein synthesis within infected cells.",

            "text": "Specific biochemical investigations are still required to decipher how hPIV3-C can both inhibit IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling and enhance EGFR and MAPK/ERK pathway. When searching the literature for viral proteins that target GRB2, we found specific reports on NS5A from hepatitis C virus and ORF3 from hepatitis E virus [54],[55]. Although NS5A inhibits MAPK/ERK activation induced by exogenous EGF, ORF3 was described as an activator of MAPK/ERK pathway like hPIV3-C. Both NS5A and ORF3 exhibit a proline-rich motif (PXXP) to bind the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of GRB2, but there is no such motif in hPIV3-C suggesting that other mechanisms mediate STAT1 and GRB2 binding. Interestingly, these two cellular proteins exhibit SH2 domains. Such domains typically bind a phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the context of a longer peptide motif within a target protein. Although there is no evidence that hPIV3-C becomes phosphorylated, we have tested hPIV3-C interaction with mutant STAT1 and GRB2 exhibiting SH2 domains disabled for the interaction with phosphotyrosine residues. These mutants were not affected for the interaction with hPIV3-C (data not shown). This suggests that hPIV3-C either binds distinct regions of STAT1 and GRB2, or interacts with a region of the SH2 domain that does not involve the phosphotyrosine binding site. Finally, our results also show that full-length hPIV3-C is required to modulate IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and MAPK/ERK pathways since AA 90-195 that bind STAT1 and GRB2 are unable to do so when expressed alone. Full-length hPIV3-C was also required to observe a localization at the cell membrane, suggesting a link with its activity. Interestingly, the N-terminal 23 residues of Sendai virus C protein act as a membrane targeting signal [56]. But the N-terminal residues of hPIV3-C (AA 1-89) were unable to do so, and sequence analysis did not show any conservation with the C protein of Sendai virus. Thus, hPIV3-C tertiary structure is apparently required to target this protein at the cell membrane. This specific localization could both sequester STAT1 to prevent the stimulation of IFN-target genes and contribute to the aggregation of GRB2-SOS complexes to enhance MAPK/ERK signaling [57]. Altogether, this suggests that hPIV3-C interaction with STAT1 and GRB2 represents a potential target for the development of antiviral molecules against hPIV3 and possibly other members of Respirovirus genus.",
