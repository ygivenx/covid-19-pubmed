This process is generally initiated by binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 on the host cell surface. The binding then induces conformational changes of the gp120, which allows the gp120 to interact with a cellular surface chemokine receptor, termed coreceptor [1]. HIV-1 can use many types of chemokine receptors as the coreceptors [2], but the two most common types of coreceptors for HIV-1 entry are CXCR4 and CCR5.",

Gp120 coreceptor binding sites of CD4-independent HIV-1 variants are exposed before the CD4 binding, and the CD4-independent gp120 directly interacts with the coreceptor for the entry [5]. It has been reported that CD4-negative cells such as liver, kidney, and CD8+ T cells are infected with the CD4-independent HIV-1 in AIDS patients, and such CD4-independent variants are thought to be associated with hepatitis, nephropathy, and CD8+ T cell dysfunction in AIDS patients [6], [8], [9], [10]. Almost all simple retroviruses, including murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), recognize multiple membrane-spanning proteins as the HIV-1 coreceptors. CD4-independent variants of simian immunodeficiency virus have been isolated more frequently than CD4-independent HIV-1 [11], [12]. HIV-1 variants that recognize CD4 as a sole receptor have not been isolated. These results suggest that CD4-independent HIV-1 variants are prototypes of CD4-dependent strains.",

It has recently been reported that inhibitors of endosomal cathepsin proteases attenuate ecotropic MLV infection [19], [20]. These results indicate that the entry of these retroviruses occurs through acidic late endosomes and requires endosomal cathepsin proteases, such as Ebola virus, reovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and coronavirus [21], [22], [23], [24]. Because cathepsin proteases are activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, the endosome acidification inhibitors might attenuate the virus infections by suppressing cathepsin protease activation. However, the endosome acidification inhibitors do not suppress CD4-dependent HIV-1 infections, but rather enhance them [25]. Therefore, the CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry likely occurs at the host cell surface, but not through endosomes. However, it has recently been shown that CD4-dependent HIV-1 enters into host cells via endosomes [26], [27]. Due to these conflicting observations, it is unclear whether the CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry occurs through endosomes or through direct fusion at the cell surface membrane.",

Hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells were as susceptible to the mNDK vector infection as 293T cells, indicating that HeLa cells lack a cellular factor(s) required for the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection. We aimed to identify the cellular factor by screening of a cDNA expression library prepared from human lymph nodes. Cystatin C, which inhibits cystein cathepsin proteases, was isolated as an enhancer of the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection in HeLa cells. A synthetic cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me, also enhanced the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection in HeLa cells, but did not affect the CD4-dependent infection. These results show that cathepsin B inhibits the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection. Because cathepsin proteases are activated by low pH in acidic late endosomes, the CD4-independent mNDK infection might occur through endosomes. Inhibitors of endosome acidification or endocytosis significantly attenuated the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection, but not the CD4-dependent infection, as expected. These results suggest that the CD4-independent HIV-1 enters through acidic late endosomes but the CD4-dependent HIV-1 does not.",

Transduction titers of the VSV and mNDK vectors in HeLa cells were about 70% and 3% of those in 293T cells, respectively. Normalization by the titer of VSV vector indicated that the susceptibility of HeLa cells to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection was only about 4% of that in 293T cells. However, when these cells were engineered to express CD4, HeLa/CD4 cells were found to be as susceptible to the CD4-dependent mNDK vector infection as 293T/CD4 and TE671/CD4 cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). Because CXCR4 is the infection receptor for the CD4-indepndent infection of the mNDK vector [4], [28], cell surface expressions of CXCR4 in these cells were analyzed. As the result, HeLa cells expressed CXCR4 more efficiently than 293T cells (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that HeLa cells either possess an inhibitory factor(s) or lack a factor(s) necessary for the CD4-independent mNDK HIV-1 vector infection.",

HeLa cells expressing cystatin C were about 3 times more susceptible to the mNDK vector infection than control HeLa cells transduced by the empty MLV vector (Fig. 3A, upper panels). Cystatin C expression also enhanced the CD4-dependent infection, but the effect on the CD4-dependent infection was less than that on the CD4-independent infection. Cystatin C protein expression in these transduced cells was confirmed by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 3A, lower panels). Cystatin C expression resulted in a 1.5-fold enhancement of the susceptibility of TE671 cells to the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection, but did not affect the susceptibility of TE671/CD4 cells. Cystatin C expression did not affect the mNDK vector infection in CD4-negative and \u2013positive 293T cells. Cystatin C did not affect the cell surface expression of CXCR4 in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B), indicating that cystatin C does not increase the CD4-independent vector infection by enhancing CXCR4 expression.

To further confirm the result, susceptibility to the CD4-independent infection and cathepsin B activity of other two cell lines, SAOS-2 and C33A cells, were measured. Surprisingly, mNDK vector-infected cells were not detected in SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 6A). Cathepsin B activity of SAOS-2 cells was higher than that of HeLa cells (Fig. 6B), and CA-074Me treatment conferred SAOS-2 cells susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection (Fig. 6C), suggesting that SAOS-2 cells are completely resistant to the CD4-independent infection due to the high level of cathepsin B activity. However, because SAOS-2 cells were less susceptible to the VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 vector infection than 293T cells (Fig. 6A), the infection resistance of SAOS-2 cells is likely to involve post-entry mechanisms either. C33A cells were as susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection as TE671 cells, and have similar level of cathepsin B activity to TE671 cells (Figs. 6A and B). CA-074Me treatment of C33A cells at 50 \u00b5M enhanced the CD4-independent infection about 5 times, like TE671 cells (Fig. 6D). Statistical analysis reveals that susceptibility to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection was reverse-correlated with cathepsin B activity of the target cells (Fig. 6E). These results strongly support the conclusion that cathepsin B is one of the critical cellular factors determining susceptibility to the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection.",

CD4-TLR4 is a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of CD4 and the intracellular domain of TLR4, and functions as a constitutively active mutant of TLR4 [35]. NF- B activation by the transfection of 293T cells with the CD4-TLR4 expression plasmid was observed (data not shown).

In contrast, the CD4-dependent HXB2 (Fig. 9) and mNDK vector (data not shown) infections were not inhibited by these inhibitors in CD4-expressing cells, and were actually increased in TE671 and HeLa cells, as previously reported [25]. Higher concentrations of the inhibitors were required to inhibit the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection in HeLa cells than in 293T cells, correlating with the levels of cathepsin B activity in these cells. The chloroquine treatment of cells reduced cathepsin B activity of cell lysates prepared from the treated cells (Fig. 9D left panel). However, when chloroquine was added to the cell lysates, their cathesin B activities were not reduced (Fig. 9D right panel). Because cathepsin proteases are activated by endosome acidification, the endosome acidification inhibitor treatment of cells suppresses cathepsin B activation, but not cathepsin activity. Treatments with these inhibitors did not reduce the cell surface expression of CXCR4 (Fig. 9E), indicating that abrogation of the CD4-independent infection by the endosome acidification inhibitors is not due to the suppression of CXCR4 expression.

Target cells were pretreated with dynasore for 5 h. Dynasore inhibits dynamine GTPase and clathrin-dependent endocytosis [39]. Dynasore treatment more efficiently attenuated the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection than the CD4-dependent mNDK (Fig. 10A) or HXB2 (data not shown) vector infection in all examined cells (P<0.05). The dynasore treatment did not affect the cell surface expression of CXCR4 (Fig. 10B), demonstrating that dynasore treatment attenuated the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection through a mechanism other than the suppression of CXCR4 expression. The dynasore treatment of target cells moderately attenuated cathepsin B activity (Fig. 10C left panel). However, when dynasore was added to cell lysates, the cathepsin B activity was not affected (Fig. 10C right panel). Inhibition of endocytosis by dynasore might suppress cathepsin B activity by reducing number of endosomes in the treated cells, because active cathepsin B is present in late endosomes. The dynasore treatment inhibited endocytosis of Cy3-conjugated transferin as expected (Fig. 10D). However, the chloroquine or CA-074Me treatment did not.

Cathepsin B activity was inversely correlated with cellular susceptibility to the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection. Overexpression of cathepsin B attenuated the CD4-independent vector infection in 293T cells. The TLR4 signal activation also attenuated the CD4-independent vector infection by enhancing cathepsin B expression. These results indicate that cathepsin B is one of the host innate immune factors resisting to the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection. The endocytosis inhibitors, dynasore and Eps15-DN, suppressed the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection, showing that the CD4-independent infection occurs through endosomes. The mechanism by which cathepsin B inhibits the CD4-independent infection is suggested as follows; higher cathepsin B protease activity in SAOS-2, HeLa, and TE671 cells causes degradation of the HIV-1 particles in acidic endosomes, attenuating the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection (Fig. 13). Inhibition of cathepsin B by the cystatin C expression or by the CA-074Me treatment increases the CD4-independent infection by suppressing the viral particle degradation.",

Another cystatin member, cystatin B, has been reported to be associated with higher susceptibility of monocyte-derived macrophages to CD4-dependent HIV-1 infection when compared to placental macrophages [41]. Because cystatin B is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, while cystatin C is generally located in late endosomes [42] or secreted, and because cystatin C did not affect the CD4-dependent HIV-1 infection in our study, the roles of cystatins B and C in HIV-1 infection should be different.",

This strongly indicates that the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection occurs through acidic endosomes, as in the case of other retroviruses (Fig. 13). In contrast, the inhibitors less efficiently attenuated the CD4-dependent HIV-1 vector infection than the CD4-independent infection, as they did in a previous report [25], suggesting that the CD4-dependent infection does not occur through acidic endosomes. However, Miyauchi et al. recently reported that CD4-dependent HIV-1 enters host cells via endosomes [26], [27]. The CD4-dependent HIV-1 particles might be internalized by dynamin-independent endocytosis. Even if the CD4-dependent HIV-1 particles are internalized into endosomes for productive infection, the CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry might occur before HIV-1 particle-bearing endosomes become acidic in late endosomes (Fig. 13). Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.",

Such microbial cystatins inhibit the host innate and adaptive immunity mediated by cathepsin proteases to allow efficient microbe proliferation in infected animals.

The culture media were supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Biosource, Rockville, MD). HeLa, TE671, and 293T cells stably expressing CD4 (HeLa/CD4, TE671/CD4, 293T/CD4) were constructed as follows. These cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding CD4- and hygromycin-resistance genes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and selected by hygromycin (Invitrogen). Hygromycin-resistant cell clones expressing CD4 were selected by FACS analysis using a FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To construct cystatin C-expressing cells, HeLa, TE671, 293T, and their CD4-expressing cells were inoculated with an MLV vector encoding cystatin C (Origene, Rockville, MD) as previously reported [57]. Because the MLV vector additionally encodes a puromycin-resistance gene, the inoculated cells were selected by puromycin (Sigma). Puromycin-resistant cell pools were used in this study. To construct cathepsin B-overexpressing cells, 293T and 293T/CD4 cells were inoculated with a cathepsin B-encoding MLV vector, and selected by puromycin. The puromycin-resistant cell pools were used in this study. To construct hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells, puromycin-resistant HeLa and geneticin-resistant 293T cells were fused by polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and were selected simultaneously by puromycin and geneticin (Invitrogen).

The transfected cells were washed with medium 24 h after transfection, and continued to be cultured in fresh medium for 24 h. Target cells were pre-treated with chloroquine (Sigma), bafilomycin A-1 (BFLA1) (Sigma), CA-074Me (Sigma), or dynasore (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 5 h. Because these compounds were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma), cells were treated with an equal volume of DMSO as a control. The pre-treated cells were inoculated with the culture supernatants of the vector-producing cells. The inoculated cells were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) (Wako) 2 days after inoculation. Blue cells were counted to estimate the transduction titer.
