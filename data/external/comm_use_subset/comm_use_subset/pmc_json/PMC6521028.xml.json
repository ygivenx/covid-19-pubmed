They cause microscopic intestinal lesions leading to serious diarrhea and often dehydration to death (1, 2). PDCoV as a pathogen was identified in 2012 in Hong Kong (3). Until now PDCoV strains have been isolated from a few regions and countries, including the United States, China, South Korea, Laos, and Thailand (4\u20137). PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with the genome length of approximately 25 kb. The genome arrangements are in the order of 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), accessory protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), accessory protein 7 (NS7), accessory protein 7a (NS7a), and 3\u2032 UTR (8, 9). PDCoV has only been found infectious in swine until now. However, PDCoV could use the aminopeptidase N (APN) of mammalian and avian species to efficiently infect cells of an unusual abroad species range, including humans and chickens (10).",

            "text": "The host innate immune response serves as the first line of defense to resist pathogenic microorganism infection and replication. The viral pathogen is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the infected host cells to induce an antiviral response. The retinoic acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are a major member of host PRRs, including three homologous protein, RIG-I, melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5), and DExH-box helicase 58 (DHX58/LGP2) (11). RIG-I and MDA5 were the activators of interferon production post RNA virus infection or the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog polyinosine and polycytidilic acid (poly(I:C)) (12). RIG-I also resides in an autorepression state in normal physiological status cells by covering its N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), which are necessary for interaction with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1/VISA/Cardif) (13\u201315). The Riplet, also known as ring finger protein 135 (RNF135), is a necessary E3 ligase for releasing RIG-I autorepression by K63-linked polyubiquitination (16). The tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) is another key E3 ligase for RIG-I activation by mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I N-terminal CARDs (17). However, MDA5 does not adopt an auto-repression state in the ligand-free state (11). MDA5 also interacts with MAVS via CARDs to active the type I interferon signaling pathway. The MAVS as the polymeric signaling scaffold could recruit and activate the signaling proteins including tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF3, TRAF5, TRAF6, and associated serine kinases (TBK1 and the IKK family) (18, 19). The activation of TBK1 could activate master transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB translocation into the cell nucleus, and then induce the antiviral genes' production, including IFN-\u03b2 and major antiviral cytokines (20). Type I IFNs are secreted and bind to the cell surface receptors of both virus-infected and non-infected neighbor cells to induce interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) for antivirals by activating the JAK-STAT pathway.",

            "text": "However, viruses take on a variety of tactics to escape the host innate immune surveillance during the infection and replication. AIV NS1 protein also could both interact with human TRIM25 and Riplet to suppress RIG-I activation (21). NS1 proteins from human but not swine or avian influenza virus strain were able to interact with human Riplet in a species-specific manner (22). West Nile virus NS1 also antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production by inhibiting RIG-I and MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination (22). Coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins play the most fundamental role in packaging the viral genome and viral assembly with a similar topological structure (23). When the coronavirus infects the host cells, the N protein is also abundantly produced to regulate the host cell cycle, cell stress responses, immune system interference, and signal transduction (24). Severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus N protein could counteract with human TRIM25 to suppress RIG-I activation (25). PEDV N protein suppressed IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB activation by sequestering the formation of human TBK1 and IRF3 complex in HEK293T cells (26). However, PEDV N protein could activate the NF-\u03baB and up-regulate the IL-8 expression in porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC), which is the target host cell of PEDV (27, 28). The other important porcine coronavirus, TGEV infection could prominently promote NF-\u03baB activation and IFN-\u03b2 production through RLR signaling in PK-15 cells (29). PDCoV infection could suppress porcine RIG-I-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production in LLC-PK1 cells (30). PDCoV Nsp5 and NS6 were confirmed as the important regulatory viral proteins to inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 production (31, 32). However, the function of other viral proteins of PDCoV, especially the viral structure protein (S, E, M, N), has remained unclear. PDCoV N protein could change expression levels of many host immune proteins in the N-expressing PK-15 (PK-PDCoV-N) cells, such as HSP70 (33). However, it remains unclear whether PDCoV N protein is an antagonist in the porcine type I interferon signaling pathway and how to regulate the antiviral signaling pathway in porcine cells.",

The cells were lysed for the dual-luciferase reporter assays. The results showed that the VSV-GFP or poly(I:C) induced porcine IFN-\u03b2-luc promoter activation was significantly suppressed by PDCoV-N protein in PK-15 cells (Figures 1A,C). However, the porcine NF-\u03baB-Luc promoter activation was not inhibited by PDCoV-N protein in PK-15 cells, when infected with VSV-GFP virus (Figure 1B). To further prove that PDCoV N protein inhibits porcine IFN-\u03b2 production, PK-15 cells were transfected with PDCoV-N expression or empty vector plasmid for 24 h and then transfected or non-transfected with poly(I:C) for 12 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells to detect the expression level of porcine IFN-\u03b2 and several interferon-induced genes (ISGs) by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that PDCoV N overexpression could significantly suppress poly(I:C)-induced porcine IFNB1 (pIFNB1), porcine OAS1 (pOAS1), and porcine ISG15 (pISG15) mRNA expression in PK-15 cells (Figure 1D). The results indicated that PDCoV N protein suppressed porcine IFN-\u03b2 production. IFN-\u03b2 could significantly inhibit the VSV replication in infected host cells. Hence, to further confirm the porcine IFN-\u03b2 protein production decreased by PDCoV N protein, VSV-GFP viruses were used to infect PK-15 cells. The results showed that poly(I:C) could significantly suppress the VSV-GFP replication in PK-15 cells (Figure 1E). In accordance with the results of dual luciferase assays and qRT-PCR described above, the expression of PDCoV N protein could restore the proliferation of VSV-GFP virus in ploy(I:C)-treated PK-15 cells (Figure 1E).

The whole cell lysates (WCLs) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag affinity gel at 28 h post transfection. The results showed that pRIG-I and pTRAF3 were clearly coprecipitated with PDCoV N protein (Figures 3A,B). In addition, consistent results were presented, when the precipitation of pRIG-I or pTRAF3 with HA-PDCoV-N was analyzed by HA-affinity gel (Figures 3C,D). These results suggested that PDCoV N protein could directly interact with pRIG-I and pTRAF3. To further confirm the direct interaction between PDCoV N and pRIG-I in porcine cells, PK-15 cells were used to co-transfect the pRIG-I or pTRAF3 and PDCoV N expression plasmid. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed at 24 h post transfection. The results showed that the PDCoV N protein and pRIG-I or pTRAF3 were co-localized in the cytoplasm in PK-15 cells (Figure 3E). All the data indicated that pRIG-I and pTRAF3 were the major targets of PDCoV N protein in the pRLR signaling pathway. RIG-I are the key cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors to recognize the RNA viruses. The activation of RIG-I was a prerequisite of IFN-\u03b2 production by RLR signaling pathway. However, in the present study, PDCoV N protein could significantly block the pRIG-I-induced pIFN-\u03b2 promoter activation (Figure 2A). Hence, pRIG-I was the main object in the following study. To investigate the interaction between PDCoV N protein and pRIG-I, two truncated mutants of PDCoV N protein(aa 1 to 246, and 168-342) were constructed and cotransfected with Flag-pRIG-I into HEK293T cells. The Co-IP results showed that the PDCoV N(1-246aa), but not another truncated region, could clearly coprecipitated with pRIG-I (Figure 3F). PDCoV N(1-246aa) was also significantly arrested pRIG-I induced porcine IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation in PK-15 and IPEC-J2 cells (Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure 2). These results indicated that the N-terminal region was important for PDCoV N protein to interact with pRIG-I and interfere its function.",

To verify this assumption, the poly(I:C) binding assay was performed. pRIG-I or PDCoV-N was eukaryotic expressed by transfection in HEK293T cells, respectively. After 28 h, the WCLs were immunoprecipitated with poly(I:C) (dsRNA) or poly(C) (ssRNA) beads. The results showed that PDCoV-N and pRIG-I could bind to the poly(I:C)-beads (Figure 4A). However, only PDCoV N protein could bind to the poly(C)-beads (Figure 4B). pRIG-I and dose-increased PDCoV-N expression plasmid were cotransfected in HEK293T cells. After 28 h, the WCLs were immunoprecipitated with poly(I:C)-beads. The results showed that the PDCoV N protein could decrease the binding of dsRNA and pRIG-I in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). The results indicated that PDCoV N protein could compete the binding of dsRNA with pRIG-I.",

This indicated that PDCoV N protein may have other functions in regulated porcine RIG-I. Previous finding indicated that viral protein could also inhibit RIG-I activation by suppressing its polyubiquitination (21, 22, 25). To explore the role of PDCoV N protein in pRIG-I ubiquitination, pRIG-I expression plasmid were cotransfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (Ub) and PDCoV N or empty plasmid in PK-15 or HEK293T cells for 28 h. The porcine RIG-I was purification by Flag affinity gel. Then, the polyubiquitination levels of pRIG-I were examined by western blot. The results showed that the polyubiquitination of pRIG-I was significantly increased, and the polyubiquitination were remarkably decreased by PDCoV N protein both in HA-tagged ubiquitin transfected PK-15 or HEK293T cells (Figures 5A,B). To further study which formation of pRIG-I linked-polyubiquitination was suppressed by PDCoV N protein, the ubiquitin K48R or K63R (HA-Ub-K48R or HA-Ub-K63R) mutant expression plasmid was used to co-transfect with porcine RIG-I together with PDCoV-N expression or empty plasmid in HEK293T cells. The results showed that PDCoV N protein could decrease the pRIG-I K48R but not K63R-induced polyubiquitination (Figure 5C). To further verify the results, the ubiquitin K63 or K48 (HA-Ub-K48 or HA-Ub-K63) only expression mutant plasmid was used to do the same experiments. PDCoV N protein could significantly decrease the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination, but not the K48-linked polyubiquitination (Figure 5D). All the results indicated that PDCoV N protein could suppress the pRIG-I polyubiquitination, especially the K63-linked polyubiquitination.",

To further explore the mechanism of PDCoV-N suppression of pRIG-I K63-polyubiquitination, porcine TRIM25 (pTRIM25) and Riplet (pRiplet) were mainly analyzed. pTRIM25 and pRiplet have only 77.93 and 67.38% identity to human TRIM25 (hTRIM25) and Riplet (hRiplet) by amino acids sequence analysis, respectively (Figure 6A). The pTRIM25 or pRiplet expression plasmid was constructed and expressed in PK-15 cells (Figure 6B). To explore the function of pTRIM25 or pRiplet in pRIG-I induced IFN-\u03b2 production, the pTRIM25, or pRiplet was cotransfected with pRIG-I and pGL3-pIFN-\u03b2-Luc and pRL-TK-Luc plasmid in PK-15 cells for 28 h. The results showed that pRiplet could significantly promote pRIG-I-induced pIFN-\u03b2-Luc activation (Figure 6C). However, pTRIM25 could not influence pRIG-I-induced pIFN-\u03b2-Luc activation (Figure 6C). The consistent results were observed in the IPEC-J2 cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). The results showed that pRiplet was the more important protein in activating pRIG-I. To determine whether PDCoV N protein could influence the pRiplet-induced pRIG-I-induced pIFN-\u03b2 production, pRIG-I and pRiplet were co-transfected with pGL3-pIFN-\u03b2-Luc, pRL-TK-Luc, and PDCoV N or empty plasmid for 28 h in PK-15 cells. The PDCoV N protein was detected in the WCLs by western blot (Figure 6D). The results showed that PDCoV N protein could prominently inhibit pIFN-\u03b2-Luc activation which is induced by pRiplet-promoted pRIG-I (Figure 6D).

PDCoV Nsp5 also could cleavage the signal transducer and activator of human transcription 2 (STAT2), an essential component of transcription factor complex ISGF3, to antagonize IFN-\u03b2 signaling in HEK293T cells (35).

However, previous reports have indicated that the different coronavirus N protein as an IFN antagonist intervened with the RLR signaling pathway by targeting different signaling proteins. SARS-CoV N protein antagonized IFN-\u03b2 in the initial signaling pathway (38). The protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT) is a cellular dsRNA-binding protein potentiating IFN production by binding to RIG-I and MDA5 (39, 40). The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV N protein could interact with PACT to suppress the dsRNA translocated to RIG-I and MDA5 (36). The PEDV N protein was found to interact with human TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 to inhibit the human TBK1/IRF3 complex confirmed to suppress IFN-\u03b2 production (26). In the present study, we proved that PDCoV N directly interacts with pRIG-I and pTRAF3 (Figure 3), which is different from the previously reported coronavirus N protein, such as PEDV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and MHV.C-terminal region of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was critical for antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 response (38). However, the N-terminal region was necessary for PDCoV N protein to inhibit porcine IFN-\u03b2 response by targeting pRIG-I (Figures 3F,G). Furthermore, we also found that PDCoV N protein significantly inhibited the porcine IRF3 induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. However, the PDCoV N protein was showed not interacting with porcine IRF3 protein, suggesting another target signal molecule of PDCoV N protein may exist in the downstream of porcine IRF3.",

In the present study, we found that PDCoV N protein could directly interact with porcine RIG-I but not porcine MDA5.

            "text": "Viral nucleic acids as pathogen associated molecular pattern are sensed by the host pattern recognition receptors after a viral infection. RIG-I and MDA5 are the major members of intracytoplasmic pathogenic molecular pattern recognition receptors that sense the intracellular viral RNA. Hence, one mechanism of the RNA virus escaping from host immune surveillance is to protect its ssRNA or dsRNA not to be recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. The MERS 4a protein is a dsRNA-binding protein that interacts with PACT in an RNA-dependent manner but not with RIG-I or MDA5, which suppresses the PACT-induced activation of RIG-I and MDA5 (41). PDCoV accessory protein 6 (NS6) could not bind dsRNA or ssRNA. However, eukaryotic-expression of PDCoV NS6 in HEK293T cells has been found to directly interact with human RIG-I and MDA5, and suppresses the host recognition of dsRNA (31). In the present study, PDCoV N protein was proven as a new member competing with porcine RIG-I binding dsRNA (Figure 4B). This is a mechanism of PDCoV N protein suppressing porcine IFN-\u03b2 induction (Figure 8). It is noteworthy that the NS6 protein must be synthesized in infection cells, unlike the N protein, which can come from the parent virus itself. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis that there may be a synergistic effect between PDCoV N protein and NS6 protein. In the early stage of virus infection, especially before the synthesis of NS6 protein, the competitive binding dsRNA of PDCoV N protein inhibits the activation of pRIG-I. With the synthesis and expression of NS6 protein, the function of PDCoV N protein is replaced by NS6, which is conducive to N protein binding the viral gRNA to complete the assembly of progeny virus.",

The results indicated that PDCoV N protein may have another function to regulate the porcine RIG-I activation or suppress the downstream signaling transduction. TRAFs have an important role in signal transduction to regulate the immune and inflammatory responses. The C-terminal domain of TRAFs mediates its oligomerization and the association with upstream or downstream effector protein. TRAF3 has been considered the important signaling molecule as the bridge between MAVS and TBK1 (19). SARS-CoV papain-like protease could negatively regulate IRF3 activation by interacting with the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex (42). SARS-CoV M protein could suppress the TBK1/IKK\u03b5-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 by preventing the formation of TRAF3/TANK/TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex (43). The C-terminal effector domain of AIV NS1 also interacts with the TRAF3 protein to decrease its K63-linked polyubiquitination and disrupt the formation of the MAVS/TRAF3 complex (44). In the present study, we confirmed that PDCoV N protein also directly interacted with porcine TRAF3 (Figure 3). The mechanism of PDCoV N protein targeting porcine TRAF3 to mediate the type I interferon signaling pathway is unclear and is currently being explored by our team.",

The E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIM25, TRIM4, and Riplet were proven to catalyze the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I in CARDs and CTD, respectively (17, 45\u201347). Suppressing the ubiquitin ligases binding with its target protein is another means of virus interfering with the host IFN-\u03b2 production. AIV NS1 protein also could suppress RIG-I activation by species-specific interaction with TRIM25 or Riplet (21). The West Nile virus NS1 also antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production by inhibiting RIG-I and MDA5 K63-linked polyubiquitination (22). The SARS-CoV N protein directly interacts with human TRIM25 to suppress the RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination (25). The MERS-CoV N protein has a similar function as SARS-CoV N to inhibit RIG-I activation (25). However, we found that PDCoV N protein neither interacts with pTRIM25 nor pRiplet (Figures 5D\u2013G). In the present study, we also found that pTRIM25 could not promote the activation of pRIG-I induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Figure 6C). It indicated that the role of homologous proteins among different species might be different in regulating the activation of RLR signaling pathway. This may be an important reason for coronavirus N protein interaction with different proteins to regulate the host innate immunity in different hosts.",

            "text": "The mechanism of Riplet-mediated RIG-I activation remains unclear. hRiplet could promote the K63-linked polyubiquitination of the RIG-I CARD domain, which was indispensable for interaction between Riplet and RIG-I (34, 48). However, hRiplet was also found mainly interacting with the RIG-I RD domain and promoting the RD domain K63-linked polyubiquitination to release RIG-I autorepression (16, 47). In the present study, we found that pRiplet, as the homologous gene of hRiplet, could directly interact with pRIG-I, which was dispensable for the HEL and RD domain but not the CARD domain (Figure 7). pRilet mediated pRIG-I activation by increasing the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination. However, PDCoV N protein could suppress the pRiplet-mediated pRIG-I activation to induce IFN-\u03b2 production. Further exploration demonstrated that PDCoV N protein blocked the pRIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination by interfering pRiplet binding to pRIG-I (Figure 8). Two theories of the interfering binding mechanism might exist: First, because of the same target domains of PDCoV N protein and pRiplet binding pRIG-I, they may be competitively binding pRIG-I. On the other hand, we found that pRiplet mainly binds to the HEL domain of pRIG-I (Figure 7D), while PDCoV N protein mainly binds to the CTD of pRIG-I (Figure 7G). The human RIG-I CTD could interact with the HEL and CARD domain to self-repression (15). Hence, another reason is that the protein conformation of pRIG-I might be changed after binding to PDCoV N protein, which leading the pRiplet could not interact with pRIG-I. To our knowledge, this is the first time that coronavirus N protein has been reported to interfere the host immune system by directly targeting host RIG-I. These results provide insight into a novel mechanism of PDCoV inhibiting the host antiviral response.",

In the cytoplasm, PDCoV release the viral genomic RNA and then complete the transcription and replication process. The ssRNA as well as dsRNA as replicative intermediate are sensed by porcine innate nucleic acids sensors in the cytoplasm to induce the IFNs production, such as porcine RIG-I. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Riplet is shown to active RIG-I by K63-linked polyubiqutination. Activation of JAK-STAT pathway by IFNs binding its receptor induces the production of ISGs, such as OAS1, ISG15. In the present, PDCoV N protein can block the porcine RIG-I dsRNA-binding and interferes with porcine Riplet-mediated porcine RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination to restrain the type I IFN response. PDCoV N protein also interacts with porcine TRAF3. However, the mechanism of the association is unclear. The other viral structure proteins are unclear in regulating type I IFN response.",
