            "text": "\nBombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm, is an economically significant insect in silk production [1]. Farmers in many developing countries such as China, India, Brazil, Vietnam, and Thailand are evolving sericulture as a foremost income source. China, the biggest cocoon producer (almost 80%) worldwide, generated a sericulture-based income of 22.4 billion \u00a5 (Yuan) (approximately equal to USD 3.24 billion by March 2017) by producing 6.61 \u00d7 108 kg of cocoons in 2011 [2]. Moreover, this lepidopteran insect has become a model organism for several fundamental studies in biochemistry, molecular genetics, and genomics [3, 4]. In-depth studies of silkworm were extensively carried out since its genome was completely sequenced in 2004 [1]. H3 N-terminus, an N-terminal tail of histone H3 in holocentric chromosomes of the silkworm, is reported to be extensively acetylated and methylated, which is almost similar to that of mammals [5]. Furthermore, the proteome of B. mori was detected to harbor a total of 342 acetylated proteins with 667 Kac (Lysine acetylation) sites [6]. However, some pathogenic agents such as viruses, fungi, and bacteria pose serious biological challenges for this sericulture causing almost 20% losses of the potential cocoon production each year. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), a member of baculoviridae family, is the pivotal viral pathogen of B. mori that could elicit almost 80% economic loses in sericultural industry [7]. On the other hand, BmNPV has been used as an effective, feasible, and safe technology for the production of recombinant proteins in insect or insect cultured cells called BEVS (baculovirus expression vector system) [8]. This system produces a large amount of the desired proteins by infecting insect cells with a virus encoding the desired transgene under the robust baculovirus polyhedrin promoter [9].",

It has been reported that BRO proteins of BmNPV undergo phosphorylation when the virus infects the host cells and reaches the maximum of phosphorylation level between 14 and 20 h p.i. which was proposed that it has effects on DNA and RNA binding activity regulations [15]. Although phosphorylation has been examined for its crucial role in the regulation of metabolism, the investigation on the protein for its phosphorylation in silkworm is yet lacking. Moreover, BmNPV is not just the most influential factor on B. mori but also useful vector on BEVS system. Hence, the study of the effect of infection on the global phosphoproteome pattern in B. mori is important to comprehend and discover advanced inventions in both fields. Employing TMT (tandem mass tag) labeling and phosphorylation affinity enrichment followed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis, we analyzed the quantitative phosphoproteome in the pair of experimental conditions (control and infected by BmNPV) to elucidate the comprehensive profiling of phosphorylation on the proteome of B. mori after the infection of BmNPV. Altogether, 6480 phosphorylation sites in 2112 protein groups were identified, among which 4764 sites in 1717 proteins were quantified. Some proteins of BmNPV also underwent post-translational modification such as p6.9 and 39 K proteins which interestingly have 2 and 4 up-regulation sites, respectively. Thus, our results will provide a fundamental resource for the prospective study of the phosphorylation in B. mori.\n",

Focusing on those phosphoproteins that were either up- or down-regulated after BmNPV infection, we identified 6480 phosphorylation sites in 2112 protein groups, among which 4764 sites in 1717 proteins were quantified. The fold-change cut-off was set when proteins with the quantitative ratios above 1.3 or below 0.77 were deemed to be significant. Among the quantified proteins, 81 hyperphosphorylated sites in 66 proteins and 25 hypophosphorylated sites in 24 proteins were identified after BmNPV infection. The distribution of peptides length from the prepared sample was between 8 and 20 (Fig. 1b), which was complied with the standard and in agreement with the property of tryptic peptides. The mass error of the peptide weight was almost zero, and most of them were less than 0.02 Da (Fig. 1c), indicating that the accuracy of MS data was as required.\n",

Moreover, other proteins also occurred with more than one regulated site, i.e., thymosin isoform XI with 4up-regulated sites and upstream activation factor subunit spp27 with 2down-regulated sites (Table 1). There are also some notable proteins of BmNPV which were modified during infection. For instance, P6.9 has two up-regulation sites and 39 K protein has 4 up-regulation sites, one of which had a very high phosphorylation ratio of 16.68 fold. Other modulated BmNPV proteins also have more than one hyperphosphorylated site such as LEF-6, Ac58-like protein, Ac82-like protein, and BRO-D in most of which a relative high phosphorylation ratio was observed (Table 2). Those proteins with the recognizable characteristic either with the remarkable phosphorylation ratio or more than one regulated sites are strongly suggested to have a significant role in the alteration of several biological functions in silkworm cells after BmNPV infection.\n\n",

The pie chart of the modulated proteins with respect to the biological processes, either the up- or down-regulated protein (Fig. 2a), showed that proteins distributed in metabolic and cellular processes have the same percentage (26%). Regarding cellular components, the up-regulated proteins were highly identified at cell (7 proteins) while the down-regulated proteins were apparently distributed evenly in the three components: membrane, organelle, and cell (2 proteins in each). Altogether, the distribution of up- or down-regulated proteins in the term of cellular component was mostly identified in the cell at 37% (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the most abundant modulated proteins in terms of molecular function were distributed in the binding activity: 32 up-regulated and 12down-regulated proteins, which amounted to 65% (Fig. 2c), the highest among the three main categories. These results strongly suggested that the binding activity in silkworm cell after BmNPV infection may be comprehensively regulated by phosphorylation.

The GO enrichment analysis showed four modulated molecular functions listed in Fig. 3a, which indicated that most of them were involved in the binding activity. The four domains were reported to be up-regulated by domain enrichment analysis (Fig. 3b) while only bmor04214 apoptosis-fly pathway in the silkworm cells was enriched in the KEGG pathway analysis (Fig. 3c). The subcellular localization classification revealed that phosphorylated proteins in the treated B. mori cells compared with the control group were primarily located in the nucleus: either up-regulated (40 proteins) or down-regulated proteins (13 proteins). In addition, the cytosolic phosphorylated proteins were also highly identified in both up-regulated (13 proteins) and down-regulated (6 proteins) phosphoproteome (Table 3). The motif analysis was carried out to identify the over represented residues which are amino acids that often found both upstream and downstream of a modification site. Using soft motif-x resulting in four distinct phosphorylation motifs (Fig. 4), the pattern of amino acids distribution was observed from position \u22126 to +6 around the phosphorylation sites. We found that the hydrophobic amino acid, proline, was drastically over represented at position +1 following the phosphorylated serine at each of the six patterns. Moreover, proline was also enriched at +2 position in motif 3 indicating that the serine-rich region and hydrophobic amino acid (proline) region of the protein were preferred for phosphorylation. In addition, some basic amino acid was also over represented, i.e., arginine in \u22123 position at motif 1 and lysine in +3 position at motif 2 implying that polar, hydrophobic, and positively charged amino acids may be functionally critical for phosphorylation.\n\n\n",

Among those modulated proteins, 34% were involved in nucleic acid binding; 10 proteins were up-regulated and 5 proteins were down-regulated. Although the phosphorylation ratio was little, more than 1/3 of the total number of proteins in the binding activity were involved in nucleic acid binding activity, indicating that phosphorylation may have a significant role in either the DNA or RNA binding activity in the silkworm cells after BmNPV infection. For instance, DNA topoisomerase II, one of the up-regulated proteins with 1.43 ratio phosphorylation, is a well-known enzyme in the process of transcription, replication, chromatin remodeling, and segregation [18]. This enzyme has been reported to have the ability to simplify the DNA topology by relaxing supercoiled DNA and unlinking knotted or catenated DNA which is in accordance with its physiological role in DNA replication and chromosome segregation [19, 20]. Moreover, the enzyme is also a predominant component of the nuclear scaffold and matrix [18, 21]. The matrix associated with the DNA regions was also reported to consist of topoisomerase II binding sites [22]. According to a search of the BmNPV genome sequence, it does not encode an ortholog of topoisomerase II. Furthermore, a recent report has proposed a plausible hypothesis that the intertwined baculovirus DNA was decatenated by topoisomerase 2 during viral replication [23]. Hence we hypothesize that the virus employs this enzyme for its genome replication by activating the enzyme through up-regulation. Study about topoisomerase for baculovirus is still lack. Further studies are necessitated to substantiate our hypothesis.",

Although in B. mori this protein is not yet examined, in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the upstream activation factor (UAF) is well-known as a multi-protein complex that tightly binds to the upstream element of the rDNA promoter and also strongly stimulates the transcription of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) [24]. Subunit spp27 of this protein is a homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe which has UAF-like activity [25] such as the ability to interact with rDNA upstream sequence binding protein; Acr1, an accumulation of condensing at rDNA 1 which has been reported to be weakly similar to RRN9, a component of Saccharomyces cereviseae UAF complex [26]. Subunit spp27 also has been reported to have good alignment with UAF30p, another subunit of UAF complex of S. cereviseae [25]. Furthermore, UAF also plays a critical role in the silencing of transcription through RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by stabilizing Pol I state [24]. The down-regulation of this protein may cause the inhibition of the silencing, which leads to the activation of transcription by Pol II. This activation of Pol II might correspond with the BmNPV-based manipulation of the host gene by miRNA that is canonically transcribed by Pol II. By encoding a miRNA, the BmNPV represses the expression of the silkworm GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran, resulting in the decrease of the host small-RNA population [27]. The down-regulation of UAF causing all those possible consequents which are eventually leading to the alleviation of the amount of host small-RNA might be required for the enhancement of BmNPV load in the infected cells.",

            "text": "Another intriguing result is that thymosin isoform XI (tiXI) is an up-regulated protein with four sites exhibiting high phosphorylation ratio. Those four sites were located at position 106th, 30th, 31st, and 107th on the amino acid sequence and the phosphorylation elevation ratios compared with the control group were 1.99, 2.0, 2.9, and 1.82, respectively. Although tiXI is not widely focused, the family of this protein, thymosin beta 4 (T\u03b24), has been extensively studied in several species and is known to have a pivotal role in the organization of cytoskeleton by binding or sequestering to actin monomers [28]. This protein regulates the actin cytoskeleton dynamics through retaining a large pool of actin monomers which interact with globular actin to produce a 1:1 complex for controlling the filamentous actin assembly [29]. T\u03b24 regulates the equilibrium between the globular and filamentous actin, which is vital for rapid rearrangement of the cytoskeleton [30]. The hyperphosphorylation of this protein after BmNPV infection might activate the cellular T\u03b24 protein which is responsible to the filamentous actin to globular actin ratio alteration [31]. This regulation appears close relation with the infection process of BmNPV. The actin and microtubule have significant roles in every virus life cycle. Viruses have ability to reorganize the cytoskeleton and restructure the host transport equipment to fulfill their needs [32], for instance, H5N1 could manipulate and exploit diverse host cytoskeletal protein to promote their infection [33]. AcMNPV has been reported to harness actin polymerization based motility in two infection phases. In the initial phase right after cell entry, they utilize motility for cytoplasm exploration and translocation to the nucleus through nuclear periphery for initiation the viral gene. In the next phase, after early gene expression, AcMNPV required motility to accumulate the distinct set of nucleocapsid at the tips of actin-rich surface spikes [34]. The up-regulation occurred on four sites of this tiXI protein with a high phosphorylation ratio after BmNPV infection strongly suggested that phosphorylation might have a predominant influence on cytoskeleton change through actin binding which is important for life cycle of every virus. Further studies are highly recommended to authenticate our hypothesis.",

Baculoviruses completely rely on the host translational equipment such as ribosomes, tRNA, amino acid metabolism and transport, chaperones for protein folding and other translation factors. The presence of AT-rich regions and unstructured 5\u2032 untranslated (UTR) regions of the virus mRNA allow the baculovirus to compete with host mRNA for translation by its higher binding activity to host translation factor [36]. A previous study revealed some translational factors in silkworm cells that were commonly up-regulated after BmNPV infection such as eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF3\u20136, eIF1A, aIF3-2b) and an elongation factor (EF1d) [16] corresponding to the present study, resulting in the hyperphosphorylation of EF1d with fold elevation ratio 1.69. Many studies have reported that the EF1d phosphorylation could alter translational efficiency [37\u201339]. Furthermore, in mammalian cell infected by herpes viruses, EF1d also phosphorylated by conserved protein kinases encoded by these viruses suggesting that it plays an important role of efficient replication of these viruses [40]. The up-regulation of BmNPV EF1d suggested that this virus might employ EF1d and enhance its translational efficiency for viral replication through phosphorylation.",

Although this protein from silkworm is yet less studied, the other proteins in the family from different species have been elucidated for the correlation with the viral infection. DDX1 is the common helicase from DEAD-box family, which has been reported as a cellular co-factor for viral replication by several viruses such as coronavirus [44], JC virus [45], hepatitis C virus [46], and also HIV-1 for replication and nuclear export [47]. With a high fold elevation ratio (2.31), the hyperphosphorylation of ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX10 protein is designated to play a major role in protein synthesis in silkworm cells after BmNPV infection.

DNA ligase has been highlighted as a crucial factor in the linkage of Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand [50]. Interestingly, the Viral DNA ligase of vaccinia virus has been reported to harness cellular Topoisomerase 2 to site the viral replication and assembly [51]. However, BmNPV apparently does not encode DNA ligase, only some baculoviruses do, such as LdMNPV (Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus), according to the BLAST result, its DNA ligase is most optimally aligned with the B. mori DNA ligase 3 isoform X1 after other lepidopteran suggesting that the DNA ligase of LdMNPV was probably acquired from host. The fact that BmNPV genome does not have the ortholog of DNA ligase suggested that the up-regulation of cellular DNA ligase may be important either for viral replication or assembly.",

In the case of human, ORC is known as important protein which is able to initiate DNA replication by facilitating the establishment of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the origin of DNA replication [53]. ORC is also known to be associated with an EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) replication origin for the propagation of its genome by utilizing antibodies against the three different subunits of human ORC in order to precipitate the cross-linked chromatin [54]. The up-regulation of B. mori orc2 protein after BmNPV infection was probably important for the activation of this protein.

Some viruses such as Oropouche virus (OROV) induce apoptosis in the cells right after their infection that causes degeneration in cells shortly after infection [56]. However, some viruses evolve strategies to evade early apoptosis in order to avoid the elimination of progeny virus spread and the limitation of virus production [55]. For instance, an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), a family of proteins which were originally discovered in baculovirus has been reported to be involved in suppressing the host cell death in response to viral infection [57, 58]. Protein kinases C (PKC) family members are associated with an extensive range of cellular responses including cell permeability, migration, hypertrophy, proliferation, secretion, and also apoptosis. In particular, PKC cascades are apparently essential modulators of the apoptotic response [59]. A recent study showed a high up-regulated phosphorylation of PKC in the silkworm cells after BmNPV infection. The hyperphosphorylated PKC occurred in the epsilon isoform (PKC\u03b5). Among several members of PKC protein family, some isoforms induceapoptosis, and the others inhibit it. PKC\u03b5 possesses the ability to enhance tumorigenesis that can associate with the suppression of apoptosis [60]. PKC\u03b5 has also been reported to trigger cellular survival by initiating the NF-\u03baB pathway [61], which leads to the activation of gene transcription encoding IAPs [62]. With PKC\u03b5 high phosphorylation ratio (3.53), we strongly suggested that the hyperphosphorylation of this protein has a great implication on the survival of host cells during BmNPV infection.",

Moreover, the deletion of this gene resulted in very poor budded virus production, low polyhedral production, oral infectivity attenuation, and deprived virogenic stroma formation [64]. The homolog of 39 k, AcMNPV orf 36 also called as pp31 has been reported to be phosphorylated as well [65].

            "text": "BmNPV protamine-like protein named P6.9 underwent phosphorylation during infection; it has two phosphorylated sites with phosphorylation ratio of 2.73 and 2.07, respectively. Although in BmNPV this protein has not been well assessed but in Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), P6.9 has been reported to be transiently phosphorylated in infected cells prior to nucleocapsid assembly [66]. This protein binds and condenses baculoviral DNA for packing into capsids [67]. By the time nucleocapsids enter nuclei through nuclear pores, P6.9 is phosphorylated which could repel the negatively charged DNA, leading to the viral genome release associated with capsid and kinase [68, 69]. A recent study indicated that during infection there are 13 Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites on P6.9 AcNMPV which interestingly 7 of those are reported to be dependent to PK1 (protein kinase 1). Moreover, replacement of those 7 Ser/Thr phosphorylated residues with Ala in P6.9 AcNMPV significantly diminishes the transcription of the very late viral genes and viral infectivity [70]. Further research is necessary to find whether phosphorylation of P6.9 BmNPV has an important role on DNA binding activity and if PK1 also has influence to the phosphorylation of this protein.",

In total, 4764 phosphorylation sites in 1717 proteins were quantified in silkworm cells, which were extensively involved in the regulation of several aspects of metabolism and molecular function during BmNPV infection. These results also suggest a large number of candidate target phosphorylated proteins for in-depth studies on the mechanism of phosphorylation modulating the alterations on the host cells during viral infection. Furthermore, we classified and discussed most of the differentially and remarkably phosphorylated proteins into several functional groups, i.e., binding activity, protein synthesis, viral replication, and apoptosis through kinase activity. There are also remarkable proteins of BmNPV which were modified during infectionsuch as P6.9, 39 K, LEF-6, Ac58-like protein, Ac82-like protein, and BRO-D among which most of those sites have relative high phosphorylation ratio and have more than one hyperphosphorylated site. Nevertheless, there will be undeniable cross-talk between these groups despite the phosphorylated proteins are involved in multiple molecular functions and cellular processes.",
