In some outbreaks, it causes high morbidity and mortality and survivors exhibit retarded growth [2]. Various enteric pathogens are known to cause pig diarrhea. Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a coronavirus, causes severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with mortality rates of 100% in piglets less than 2 weeks old [3]. However, piglets that live more than six to eight days after infection can recover, although they are often stunted. These recovered pigs can spread TGE to uninfected swine for many weeks [4].",

A healthy gut allows a pig to thrive throughout its lifespan without sickness. Sound animals utilize dietary nutrients efficiently, have better production performance, and generate higher profits for swine producers [6]. The impact of TGEV on the small intestine of growing pigs that survive infection has not been investigated. We therefore evaluated morphological alterations of the small intestine, changes in immune cells in the jejunum, variation of intestinal microflora, and other features in TGEV survivors. The results will help us understand the pathogenesis of TGEV and the overall impact of TGEV infection on swine.",

Proper development of the pig gut is not only associated with feeding efficiency, but also with susceptibility to pathogens throughout life. Maldevelopment of the small intestine in TGEV-infected pigs may decrease absorptive capacity and result in a lower feed conversion rate [12]. Our results demonstrated that the cause of impaired growth in TGEV-infected pigs is very likely due to the changes in intestinal morphology and in other characteristics. Julio et al. showed that PEDV infection impairs the performance of surviving pigs, which show increased levels of mortality, reduction in feed conversion ratio, and decreased levels of average daily gain [13]. Aggregated lymphoid follicles, commonly designated PPs, function as immune sensors of the intestine [14]. We found that TGEV-infected pigs have dysplastic PPs, suggesting that their mucosal immune system is immature.",

            "text": "The intestinal immune system is crucial for maintenance of mucosal homeostasis and protection against microbial invasion. SIgA plays an important role in promoting the clearance of antigens and pathogenic microorganisms from the intestinal lumen [15]. The mucosal IgA production is correlated with Th2-dependent cytokines [16]. Most intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes are CD3+T cells, and reside in the intestinal epithelium and subjacent superficial lamina propria, and thus are positioned at the border of the microbial and dietary environment [17]. DCs are specialized antigen-presenting cells and are key regulators of adaptive immune responses, which play important roles in the generation and regulation of the responses to intestinal antigens [18]. We observed fewer IgA secretory cells, CD3+T cells, and DCs in TGEV-infected pigs, indicating impaired immune function in the intestinal tract after TGEV infection. The sampling of intestinal pathogens by M cells is important for the induction of an efficient immune response in PPs. However, M cells are also exploited by pathogens as an entry portal for invasion of the host [19]. Certain pathogens, or exposure to inflammatory stimuli, can significantly enhance the density of M cells in the intestine [20]. Our experiments show that TGEV infection apparently increases M cell density. We hypothesize that this reflects a persistent TGEV infection, which induces an inflammatory response.",

Proinflammatory cytokine production is important for pathogen clearance, while excessive inflammation can cause tissue damage. The anti-inflammatory master regulator IL-10 balances the proinflammatory signals and limits severe inflammatory responses. However, in some circumstances, elevated IL-10 levels can exhaust antiviral T cells and induce immunosuppression, which enables viral persistence [27]. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines are important factors in chronic inflammatory responses that promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting that persistent TGEV infection may promote EMT in vivo [28, 29]. TGF-\u03b2 also functions in immune suppression and plays an important role in viral persistence [30], and TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been shown to promote IL-10 gene transcription [31].",
