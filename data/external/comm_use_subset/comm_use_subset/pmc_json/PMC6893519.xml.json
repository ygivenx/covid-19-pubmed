            "text": "All positive strand RNA (+RNA) viruses studied to date have rearranged the membranes of their host cell to create the virus replication organelle (RO). For several viruses, ROs have been proven to be the site of viral RNA synthesis [1,2,3,4]. As such, ROs are thought to facilitate the coordination of the processes involved in viral RNA synthesis, as well as provide an enclosed environment to protect viral RNA from detection by the host cell. This helps to prevent degradation of viral RNA by host enzymes and, importantly, prevent activation of cellular intrinsic antiviral signaling pathways. Therefore, RO formation and function are critical steps in the replication cycle of all +RNA viruses. The membrane origin, shape, and structure of ROs varies between different virus families, but there are common themes in the types of structure produced. Several viruses, including enteroviruses, arteriviruses, toroviruses, hepatitis C virus, and foot and mouth disease virus, induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), often along with single-membrane vesicles and tubules or paired membranes [5,6,7,8,9,10]. The second type of structure which are commonly induced are spherules or invaginated vesicles, which are formed by alphaviruses, flaviviruses, bromoviruses, and nodaviruses [3,4,11,12,13,14,15]. These are small single-membrane vesicles which are pinched out from a cellular membrane, but they remain tethered to the membrane and possess a channel connecting the interior of the spherule with the cytoplasm.",

Coronaviruses infect a wide range of species, including swine, cattle, poultry, dogs, cats, horses, and humans, causing economically damaging diseases impacting livestock farming industries, significant companion animal morbidity, and important human illnesses. In the last 17 years, two novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have emerged into the human population from zoonotic sources (bats via civets and camels, respectively) and have caused significant illnesses with high mortality rates [16,17]. This, along with the recent emergence of swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS)-CoV in pigs arising after a species jump [18,19], highlights the importance of this family of viruses as a threat to human health with the potential for further emergence of new pathogenic viruses. There are four genera within the coronavirus family, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses, and the ROs of viruses within these genera have been characterized. All coronaviruses induce the formation of DMVs. In addition, there are rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to form either a branching network of membranes, referred to as convoluted membranes (CM) found in Alpha- and Betacoronavirus infected cells [20,21,22,23], or paired ER membranes, referred to as zippered ER in Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infected cells identified in our previous work [24,25]. Small double-membrane spherules, not seen previously in cells infected with other coronaviruses, are associated with the zippered ER in IBV-infected cells are.",

The majority of members of this genus infect avian species and have been identified only through sequencing the viral genome. Therefore, in the absence of viral isolates able to replicate in cell culture, studying the virus\u2013host interactions of this genus of coronaviruses has not been possible. However, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was identified in Hong Kong in 2012 [26], and subsequently from pigs in the USA and other countries [27,28,29,30,31]. The virus causes an acute gastrointestinal infection with severe diarrhea, vomiting, and atrophic enteritis [32]. Importantly, cell culture adapted strains of PDCoV have now been developed [33,34,35], allowing the characterization of how this genus of coronaviruses interacts with its host cell, including a characterization of the Deltacoronavirus RO. In a recent publication, Qin et. al. confirmed the presence of DMVs in PDCoV infected cells [36]. However, neither CM nor zippered ER and spherules were identified. Here, we characterized PDCoV stain OH-FD22 [34] replication in porcine LLC-PK1 cells, including a detailed characterization of ROs.",

Coronavirus replication is associated with the accumulation of dsRNA in cytoplasmic puncta [20,24,39,41]. Although the precise nature and role of this dsRNA is debated, the location of dsRNA is regularly used as a marker for the sites of viral RNA synthesis. Due to the shortage of available reagents to visualize PDCoV proteins in infected cells and to allow comparison to the numerous previous studies on other coronaviruses, cells were infected or mock-infected and were fixed and labelled with antibodies specific for N and dsRNA at different timepoints following infection (Figure 2). No signal could be detected in mock-infected cells or in cells fixed at 2 hpi. However, at 4 hpi, clusters of cytoplasmic puncta of N protein were seen, with a smaller number of dsRNA puncta also visible. These appeared in the same area of the cell, but did not appear to co-localize. By 6 hpi, the number of both N and dsRNA puncta had increased. By 8 hpi, the N signal was found throughout the cytoplasm and appeared in a reticular staining pattern. The number of dsRNA puncta also continued to increase from 8 hpi to 24 hpi. These results indicate that viral RNA synthesis is likely to begin from around 4 hpi.",

Cells were infected or mock-infected and were treated with BrU in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) for 30 min prior to fixation to inhibit cellular RNA synthesis. BrU incorporated into nascent RNA was then detected using an anti-BrdU antibody (Figure 3). In mock-infected cells incubated in BrU without ActD, cellular RNA was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, as expected. In the presence of ActD, this signal was lost. This confirmed that BrU signal detected in PDCoV infected cells was newly synthesized viral RNA. No BrU signal was detected at 2 hpi. However, at 3 hpi, individual cytoplasmic puncta or small clusters of puncta could be seen. The number of puncta increased as the infection progressed, and they became more widely dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. This demonstrates that PDCoV RNA synthesis begins from 2.5\u20133 hpi in small clusters within the cytoplasm and by later timepoints, numerous sites of RNA synthesis exist within the cell.",

The N protein binds to viral RNA forming the ribonucleoprotein complex, and genetic material is packaged into new particles in this form [42]. Furthermore, coronavirus ROs are connected to and contiguous with the cellular ER [20,24]. Therefore, nascent RNA could be expected to co-localize with these markers. Cells were infected or mock-infected with PDCoV. At 5.5 hpi, cells were treated with BrU and ActD as described previously, followed by fixation at 6 hpi and labelling to detect BrU, N, and ER (Figure 4). As seen before, BrU-labelled RNA was only detectable in PDCoV infected cells, not mock-infected cells, and the signal appeared in small cytoplasmic puncta. The BrU signal was found to be associated with the N protein, but it was not completely co-localized. Instead, the small BrU puncta appeared to localize near or next to larger N puncta (Figure 4). However, BrU puncta also appeared to exist that were not associated with N, and there were some N puncta that were not associated with BrU. When BrU localization was compared to an ER marker, there was no evidence of co-localization between the two signals.",

            "text": "It has recently been reported that PDCoV infection triggers the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) [36]. However, the presence of either CM or zippered ER and double-membrane spherules has not been demonstrated. Therefore, a detailed analysis of PDCoV ROs was performed. Cells infected with PDCoV or mock-infected were fixed at a range of timepoints post-infection and were embedded and processed for transmission electron microscopy analysis. Initially, samples from 8 hpi were imaged (Figure 5). At this timepoint, virus particles in vesicles were found, either as individual particles per vesicle (Figure 5C) or multiple particles in a single larger vesicle (Figure 5B). In addition, DMVs were clearly visible (Figure 5C\u2013E). The samples were prepared by glutaraldehyde fixation and, as observed previously under these conditions, DMVs had a fibrous content and the two membranes were closely apposed in some areas, but had become separated from one another in other areas [21,43,44]. Large regions with numerous DMVs were observed, as well as both individual DMVs and clusters of small number of DMVs. In addition to DMVs, regions of small double-membrane vesicles were found interspersed with sections of paired membranes (Figure 5B,E,F). The small double-membrane vesicles had very tightly apposed membranes, and the membranes appeared to be lined with electron-dense content (zoomed in box, Figure 5F). The areas of paired membranes and small double-membrane vesicles were surrounded by electron-dense material and appeared highly comparable to regions of zippered ER with associated spherules identified previously in cells infected with Gammacoronavirus IBV [24]. Both large and small regions of zippered ER and spherules were observed in PDCoV infected cells, and they were most commonly found in the perinuclear region. Regions of zippered ER and spherules often, although not always, had a small number of DMVs in the vicinity. Together, this demonstrates that the PDCoV RO is made up of both DMVs and zippered ER with double-membrane spherules. ",

No ROs or any other evidence of virus infection were detected at 4 hpi. However, at 6 hpi and 24 hpi, ROs comprising both DMVs and regions of zippered ER and double-membrane spherules were found. ROs visualized at both 6 hpi and 24 hpi were highly comparable to those seen at 8 hpi. In addition, at 24 hpi, as well as virus particles in vesicles, virus particles were observed in the ER, presumably as a result of budding into the ER. Together, this confirms the presence of ROs made up of DMVs, zippered ER, and spherules from 6 hpi to 24 hpi, during the peak of PDCoV RNA synthesis.",

Although viral RNA could be detected from the start of the experiment at 2 hpi, this was most likely input genomic RNA. New RNA synthesis, as determined by an increase over this baseline level of RNA, was detected from 6 hpi, indicating that new viral RNA had been synthesized by this timepoint. This corresponded with detection of increased levels of viral protein at the same timepoint. The subsequent release of the progeny virus was detected from 10 hpi. This data is broadly consistent with observations for the replication dynamics of other coronaviruses, including MHV, SARS-CoV, IBV, and another lab-adapted strain of PDCoV [21,24,36,45,46,47].",

            "text": "Following the initial characterization of viral replication dynamics, the accumulation of virus replication associated dsRNA was visualized. Although historically used as a marker for sites of RNA synthesis, the role of dsRNA during coronavirus infection is not currently clear. It localized to the interior of DMVs in SARS-CoV infected cells [20], and although it co-localized with sites of active RNA synthesis at early timepoints in MHV infected cells, this was less obvious at later timepoints [39]. In addition, there was only partial co-localization between dsRNA and replicase proteins from other coronaviruses and more distantly related nidoviruses [5,20,21,43,44,48,49]. Therefore, it is not currently understood whether dsRNA represents a bona fide intermediate in viral RNA synthesis, is a byproduct of virus replication, or performs some other function. Despite this, dsRNA accumulation correlated with the onset of viral RNA synthesis and provides a useful marker, especially considering the limited availability of reagents to study PDCoV. Therefore, the accumulation of dsRNA in PDCoV-infected cells and co-localization with N protein was determined. Both dsRNA and N were detected in a small number of cytoplasmic puncta from 4 hpi, and these puncta were clustered together. From 6 hpi, the number of dsRNA puncta increased, and the puncta became more dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, as has been seen for other coronaviruses [20,24,39]. The number of N puncta also increased by 6 hpi, and from 8 hpi onward, the N signal predominantly showed a cytoplasmic reticular pattern. This demonstrates that the onset of PDCoV protein synthesis occurred prior to 4 hpi, which was earlier than detected by western blot. It is not surprising that small changes in N levels were less likely to be detected at the population level as determined by western blot than when imaging individual infected cells. Also, in agreement with previous observations, there appeared to be little co-localization between dsRNA and N at any timepoint studied here. The dynamics of dsRNA accumulation and location within the PDCoV infected cell were comparable to other previously studied coronaviruses. Numerous questions remain regarding the identity, involvement, and importance of dsRNA in the replication cycle of coronaviruses. However, these questions are beyond the scope of the current work and will form the basis of future studies.",

This allowed the visualization of RNA synthesized within a defined period of time (here, 30 min prior to fixation of cells). Using this technique, the onset of viral RNA synthesis was shown to be between 2.5 hpi and 3 hpi. Again, this was significantly earlier than detected at the population level using RT-qPCR, reflecting the increased sensitivity of single cell analyses. The sites of viral RNA synthesis appeared in individual puncta or small clusters of puncta in the perinuclear region. As the infection proceeded, comparable to sites of dsRNA accumulation, the number of BrU puncta increased and became more dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. By 4 hpi, there was a small increase in the number of puncta, but the number and spread of puncta increased dramatically by 6 hpi. Therefore, a small number of ROs was expected at 3 hpi and 4 hpi. However, by 6 hpi, numerous ROs were present throughout large areas of the cytoplasm. The dramatic increase in the number of sites of RNA synthesis (BrU puncta) by 6 hpi correlates with the observed increase in accumulated viral RNA detected by RT-qPCR, indicating that RT-qPCR is not sufficiently sensitive to detect small changes in total RNA at earlier timepoints.",

            "text": "Further analysis of the cellular location of viral RNA synthesis was performed. BrU-labelled nascent RNA was found to be associated with the N protein. As the N protein is known to bind to viral RNA forming the ribonucleoprotein complex, this was expected. Interestingly, however, the two signals were not found to completely co-localize. Instead, smaller BrU puncta were located on or next to the larger N puncta. Although the significance of this is unknown, it is possible that when N is directly bound to viral RNA, the antibody is not able to gain access, meaning that only N in certain conformations is detected by this method. Conversely, N binding of BrU-labelled RNA may prevent access of the anti-BrdU antibody. In addition to areas where N and nascent RNA were associated, there were also BrU puncta with no obvious N signal in the vicinity. These puncta possibly reflect viral mRNAs that are not bound by N protein, or it may be possible that some other viral RNAs exist in locations where N binding does not occur. Finally, an N protein signal was observed without any associated BrU signal. The N protein is a highly abundant protein and is known to be multifunctional. In addition to binding genomic RNA, N plays a role in regulating gene expression, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, and can alter the cellular cytoskeleton [50,51,52,53]. Next, the association of BrU-labelled nascent viral RNA with the cellular ER was investigated. Here, no evidence of association or co-localization were observed. It may appear surprising that ROs do not co-localize with the ER, since that they are known to be derived from and connected to the ER [20,24,54]. However, although previous observations using other coronaviruses have noted some co-localization between markers for ROs and the ER, this was not complete, as substantial amounts of viral marker did not localize to the ER. Furthermore, an ER marker was found to be absent from SARS-CoV DMV membranes [44,49,54]. Indeed, virus-induced modification of the ER is substantial, especially in the case of the tightly apposed membranes of both the zippered ER and DMVs. It is highly probable that this results in the exclusion of normal ER markers from these modified membrane structures.",

Furthermore, the appearance of these DMVs was indistinguishable from DMVs found in other coronavirus infected cells when fixed with glutaraldehyde. DMVs were first detected at 6 hpi and continued to be detected until 24 hpi, which was the latest timepoint studied. Throughout infection, DMVs were observed as individual vesicles or in either small or large clusters. However, as seen for IBV [24], the DMVs were rarely in close proximity. This made it unlikely for DMVs to have connections and form part of an interconnected membrane network, as observed for SARS-CoV [20]. In addition, the large clusters of DMVs were not found to be associated with zippered ER and spherules, suggesting there may be functional differences between these structures. Finally, no likely intermediates in DMV formation were observed at any timepoint. Therefore, it remains to be determined precisely how DMVs are formed.",

Furthermore, no regions of more branching CMs were identified. Zippered ER and spherules were detected from 6 hpi to 24 hpi, and their appearances did not alter over this time course. Throughout infection, both large and small areas of zippered ER and spherules were found. These were predominantly in the perinuclear region. Often, although not always, a small number of DMVs were found in the proximity. Significantly, the regions of zippered ER and spherules were highly comparable to those identified previously in IBV-infected cells [24]. Therefore, the ROs of Gamma- and Deltacoronaviruses appear to be conserved.",
