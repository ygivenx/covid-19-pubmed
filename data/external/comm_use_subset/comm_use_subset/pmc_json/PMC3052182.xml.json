            "text": "Paramyxoviridae is a large and diverse family whose members have been isolated from many species of avian, terrestrial, and aquatic animal species around the world [1]. Paramyxoviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped, cytoplasmic viruses that have a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome. The family is divided into two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae, based on their structure, genome organization, and sequence relatedness [2]. The subfamily Paramyxovirinae contains five genera: Respirovirus, Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus, and Avulavirus, while the subfamily Pneumovirinae contains two genera, Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus [3]. All paramyxoviruses that have been isolated to date from avian species can be segregated into two genera based on the taxonomic criteria mentioned above: genus Avulavirus, whose members are called the avian paramyxoviruses (APMV), and genus Metapneumovirus, whose members are called avian metapneumoviruses. The APMV of genus Avulavirus are separated into nine serotypes (APMV-1 through -9) based on Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and Neuraminidase Inhibition (NI) assays [4]. Various strains of APMV-1, which is also called Newcastle disease virus (NDV), have been analyzed in detail by biochemical analysis, genome sequencing, and pathogenesis studies, and important molecular determinants of virulence have been identified [5-9]. As a first step in characterizing the other APMV serotypes, complete genome sequences of one or more representative strains of APMV serotypes 2 to 9 were recently determined, expanding our knowledge about these viruses [10-18].",

            "text": "APMV-1 comprises all strains of NDV and is the best characterized serotype because of the severity of disease caused by virulent NDV strains in chickens. NDV strains vary greatly in their pathogenicity to chickens and are grouped into three pathotypes: highly virulent (velogenic) strains, which cause severe respiratory and neurological disease in chickens; moderately virulent (mesogenic) strains, which cause mild disease; and non-pathogenic (lentogenic) strains, which cause inapparent infections. In contrast, very little is known about the comparative disease potential of APMV-2 to APMV-9 in domestic and wild birds. APMV-2 strains have been isolated from chickens, turkeys and wild birds across the globe [4,19-22]. APMV-2 infections in turkeys have been found to cause mild respiratory disease, decreases in egg production, and infertility [23,24]. APMV-3 strains have been isolated from wild and domestic birds [25]. APMV-3 infections have been associated with encephalitis and high mortality in caged birds [26-28]. APMV-4 strains have been isolated from chickens, ducks and geese [29]. Experimental infection of chickens with APMV-4 resulted in mild interstitial pneumonia and catarrhal tracheitis [30]. APMV-5 strains have only been isolated from budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) and cause depression, dyspnoea, diarrhea, torticollis, and acute fatal enteritis in immature budgerigars, leading to very high mortality [31]. APMV-6 was first isolated from a domestic duck and was found to cause mild respiratory disease and drop in egg production in turkeys, but was avirulent in chickens [10,30,32]. APMV-7 was first isolated from a hunter-killed dove and has also been isolated from a natural outbreak of respiratory disease in turkeys. APMV-7 infection in turkeys caused respiratory disease, mild multifocal nodular lymphocytic airsacculitis, and decreased egg production [33]. APMV-8 was isolated from a goose and a feral pintail duck [34,35]. APMV-9 strains have been isolated from ducks around the world [36,37]. APMV types -2, -3, and -7 have been associated with mild respiratory disease and egg production problems in domestic chickens [33]. There are no reports of isolation of APMV-5, -8 and -9 from poultry [32]. But recent serosurveillance of commercial poultry farms in USA indicated the possible prevalence of all APMV serotypes excluding APMV-5 in chickens [38].",

APMV-1 infections in non-avian species are usually asymptomatic or mild. Clinical signs in human infections commonly involve conjunctivitis, which usually is transient and self-limiting. Presently, APMV-1 is being evaluated as a vaccine vector against human pathogens [45]. When administered to the respiratory tract of non-human primates, NDV is highly restricted in replication, but foreign antigens expressed by recombinant NDV vectors are moderately to highly immunogenic. One of the major advantages of this approach is that most humans do not have pre-existing immunity to APMV-1. Pre-existing immunity is a potential drawback to using vectors derived from common human pathogens, and also can be a concern for any vector if two or more doses are necessary to elicit protective immunity. Therefore, we are investigating APMV types 2 to 9, which are antigenically distinct from APMV-1, as alternative human vaccine vectors. Also, some of these additional APMV types likely will have differences in replication, attenuation, and immunogenicity compared to APMV-1 that may be advantageous. However, the replication and pathogenicity of APMV-2 to -9 in non-avian species has not been studied. As a first step, we have evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of APMV-2 to -9 in hamsters. In this study, groups of hamsters were infected with a prototype strain of each APMV serotype by the intranasal route and monitored for virus replication, clinical symptoms, histopathology, and seroconversion. Our results showed that each of the APMV serotypes replicated in hamsters without causing adverse clinical signs of illness, although histopathologic evidence of disease was observed in some cases, and also induced high neutralizing antibody titers.",

Each of the antisera exhibited very high HI titer against the homologous serotype and either no or very low HI titer against heterologous serotypes, with the exception of APMV -1 and APMV-9 (Table 3). The antiserum specific for APMV-1 and APMV-9 exhibited substantial cross-reactivity, although the APMV-1-specific antiserum had a four-fold higher titer against APMV-1 than against APMV-9, and the APMV-9 specific antiserum had a two-fold higher titer against APMV-9 than against APMV-1. These reactions indicated the existence of antigenic relatedness between APMV-1 and APMV-9.",

APMV-2 to -9 have been isolated from both wild and domestic birds, but their disease potential in wild or domestic birds is largely unknown. APMV-1 has also been shown to infect a number of non avian species [41] and presently is being evaluated as a potential human vaccine vector for human pathogens [45]. Therefore, there is a possibility that APMV -2 to -9 could also be used as human vaccine vectors for human pathogens.

Although APMV-5 was not detected by virus isolation or by IHC in any of the tissues, all of the animals that were inoculated with APMV-5 developed titers of APMV-5 specific antibodies detected by virus plaque reduction neutralization assay, indicating a low level of replication. By 14 dpi, no virus could be detected in any of the tissues in any the infected hamsters for any serotype, whether by histopathology, histochemistry, or virus isolation. This suggests that the virus was cleared from all tissues and disease was resolved, indicating the self-limited nature of the infections.

In addition, the detection of viral antigens, and in most cases infectious virus, in nasal turbinates and lungs of the hamsters indicate that APMV replication is mostly restricted to the respiratory tract.

Based on the HI titers, APMV-8 (1:1024) produced maximum antibody titer and APMV-4 (1:32) produced the least. Paradoxically, while APMV-8 induced the highest titer of HI antibodies, the virus could not be isolated from any of the infected hamsters. Conversely, APMV-4 replicated efficiently in hamsters as observed by virus isolation in nasal turbinates, lungs and kidneys, but produced low levels of virus-specific HI antibodies. Whether these examples of incongruity between levels of replication and serum antibody responses are indicative of differences in the antigenicity of the respective HN proteins or to some other factor remains to be determined.",

[30] have also provided evidence of low HI titers in the case of APMV-4, in chickens, which was taken as evidence of a low level of replication of this virus in chickens. The HI test is the most commonly used method to diagnose APMV infections and also is used to measure the antibody response. But chicken antiserum against NDV cross-reacts in HI tests with several of the other APMV serotypes, thus questioning the specificity of HI test in field cases [55]. Warke et al. [38] indicated that the HI test lacks sensitivity for detecting infection with these APMV serotypes. They also observed that even in the case of a high infectious dose and observed microscopic changes in the infected organs, high HI titers were not observed in the infected birds. On the contrary in our study, most of the APMV serotypes replicated well in hamsters, producing mild respiratory pathology and high neutralizing antibody titers. Our results indicated that the antibody developed in hamsters against these serotypes were very specific and no cross reaction was observed between serotypes except between APMV-1 and -9. Cross-reactivity between these two serotypes is not completely unanticipated, since they share the highest level of genome nucleotide sequence identity (58%) among the APMV serotypes [12]. Hence, we conclude that the HI test with hamster serum is highly specific and can be used to diagnose different APMV serotypes in field cases.",

There was a concern that APMVs may also replicate in the intestine and shed in feces, which might act as a source of infection for the other animals. But our results indicated that none of the APMVs replicate in the intestinal epithelial cells of hamsters. Importantly, our results also suggest that these viruses do not cross the blood-brain barrier and do not induce neurological symptoms. Also, our previous experimental studies of all the APMVs in chickens showed that they were avirulent. Taken together, these results show that the APMVs replicate moderately in hamsters and produce either mild or no clinical signs, and elicit substantial antibody responses. Therefore, it is possible that APMVs might replicate in other mammalian species including humans. In conclusion, this study is the first comparative report on the replication and pathogenicity of prototype strains of all 9 APMV serotypes in hamsters. Our results lay the foundation for a good laboratory animal model for testing the replication and pathogenicity of APMV strains.",
