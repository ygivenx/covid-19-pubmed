            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic functional cytokines with antiviral, antitumor, and natural immune-boosting effects. IFNs play a significant role in eliciting an antiviral state in vertebrates [3]. IFNs are broadly categorized into three distinct types based on their molecular structure, receptor specificity, and induction pathway [4]. Type I IFNs include IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03ba, and IFN\u03c9, and all signal via common cell surface receptors (IFN\u03b1R-1) and (IFN\u03b1R-2), which are situated on a broad range of cells [3]. Type II IFNs consist of IFN-\u03b3, which is activated through highly specific ligand interactions with distinct IFN-\u03b3 receptors (IFN-\u03b3R1) and (IFN-\u03b3R2). The third family of IFNs consists of IFN lambda, which interacts with a heterodimeric receptor complex (IL-28R\u03b1 and IL-10\u03b2). IFN-\u03bb was first discovered in mammals and subdivided into IFN-\u03bb1 (also known as IL-29), IFN- \u03bb2 (IL-28A), IFN- \u03bb3 (IL-28B), and IFN-\u03bb4 [5]. IFNs are crucial in an innate immune response, as their expression and antiviral potential is dependent on their cognate receptor interaction in a particular system [6]. In chickens, type I IFNs primarily interact in fibroblasts, whereas epithelial cells (gastrointestinal and respiratory tract) are the primary site for the actions of type III IFNs [7]. Despite morphological diversity, IFNs share integrated, interconnected, and a precisely coordinated cascade in immunity pathways [3]. ",

This leads to phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, activation of interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), binding of IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), and expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) [8]. Once expressed, these ISGs demonstrate an essential role in the antiviral response. It is evident from published data that IFNs upregulate identical sets of ISGs, which in turn express antiviral proteins. IFN-induced transmembrane protein (IFITMs), viperin and myxovirus resistance protein (Mx) are some of the potent antiviral proteins expressed in response to viral infections [9]. Once expressed, these ISGs control viral replication, which provides an antiviral atmosphere to limit viral propagation in infected cells.",

Compared to type I IFNs, chIFN-\u03bb has also been shown to elicit moderate antiviral response in both the chicken macrophage cell line HD11 and primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) [13]. Another published study demonstrated that CEFs treated with recombinant chIFN-\u03bb induced ISGs in a temporal fashion [14].

Furthermore, 36% of amino acids are identical between HuIFN-\u03bbII and chIFN-\u03bb, which signifies the similarity of these two IFNs. However, unlike mammals, only one member exists in chicken (chIFN-\u03bb). This is in agreement with the other types of chicken IFNs, which have fewer members compared to mammalian IFNs [27].",

            "text": "Reduced expression of ISGs in response to chIFN-\u03bb in our experiment demonstrates the fact that CEFs are optimally less receptive to IFN-\u03bb, which is in agreement with published reports [10]. One study revealed that chIFN-\u03bb can actively inhibit the viral replication of AI in primary embryonic tracheal organ cultures and CLEC-213 (chicken lung cell line). It is further postulated that with treatment of chIFN-\u03bb, ISGs are expressed significantly, especially Mx gene, which is primarily expressed in epithelial rich organs (i.e., trachea, lungs, and intestine) was also observed in the present study [10]. Furthermore, studies have also revealed that a high degree of cell type specificity in receptor\u2013ligand interactions make avian IFNs distinct from mammalian IFNs. Recently, it has been established that chicken IFN-\u03bb inhibits low pathogenic influenza virus replication in CEFs; however, as compared to chIFN-\u03b3 and chIFN-\u03b2, higher doses are required to induce ISGs and maintain the strong antiviral state in the cells [14]. GO and KEGG analysis of each experimental group demonstrated overlapping biological functions. An important gene involved in the host response of infected samples is RSAD2, also termed viperin, which is one of the potent interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) responsible for eliciting a broad antiviral state against a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens [28]. In mammals, it is highly expressed in response to invading viral infections [29]. Elevated expression of viperin in chIFN-\u03bb-treated organs further augments the expression of ISGs in response to injected IFN in vivo. Viperin was upregulated in response to chIFN-\u03bb treatment, which is symbolic for all ISGs. IFN-inducible transmembrane protein-1 (IFITM-1) is one of the potent ISGs expressed in response to either type of IFN and plays an antiviral role by blocking cytoplasmic entry [30]. It is further demonstrated that IFITM alters membrane fluidity, hence producing curvature in the outer leaflets of the membrane or by interfering with intracellular cholesterol homeostasis [31,32]. Significant upregulation of IFITM3 in the chIFN-\u03bb-treated thymus augments the temporal expression of ISGs in response to IFN treatment. Further studies are needed to investigate the possible future role of chIFN-\u03bb as a potent and novel therapeutic in the poultry industry.",

Furthermore, in vitro exposure of CEF to chIFN-\u03bb demonstrated a rapid surge of pro inflammatory cytokines. Considering their vital role in immune pathways, cytokine gene expression is widely employed as an indicator for the immune response. We did observe some genes that were previously illustrated in publications; one such example is chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 1 (CCL1, ENSGALT00000003670) [33]. Chemokines are secreted chemotactic cytokines that play a fundamental role in the recruitment and migration of lymphoid and myeloid cells in target tissues, and hence govern the avian immune response [34]. CCL1 is a chemokine secreted by monocytes that is capable of activating macrophages and T lymphocytes [35]. CCL20, like its mammalian orthologue, is responsible for recruiting lymphoid cells and is involved in the early immune response in chickens [36]. Likewise, CCL1, CCL4, and CCL5 were also upregulated in CEF and are chiefly involved in the innate avian immune response.",

This response ostensibly is due to rapid and sustained signaling via cell surface receptors and a surge of chemokines and cytokines, which in turn create an antiviral environment. A contrasting feature of the present study is the upregulation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway in all three treatment groups, where it is evident that numerous genes are upregulated in TLR mediated cytotoxicity. TLR15, a unique chicken receptor expressed on the surface of fibroblasts, heterophils, and macrophages, shares 30% sequence identity with TLR2 [37]. It is evident from experimentation that TLR15 is a broad spectrum TLR that has the capability to recognize heat stable components of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, CpG oligonucleotides, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and tripalmitoylated lipopeptide [38]. TLR15, an avian-specific TLR, plays a significant role in avian immune responses against bacterial and viral pathogens. Recently, it has been demonstrated that diacylated lipopeptide from Mycoplasma synoviae activated TLR15 and regulated innate immune responses [39]. Similarly, significant upregulation of TLR15, observed in the present study, highlights a possible role of chIFN-\u03bb against Mycoplasma infections in chicken. However, it warrants future studies to delineate the molecular processes.",

It is evident that in mammals, IFN-\u03bb elicits a protective antiviral response toward AI, whereas IFN-\u03bb plays a minor role in lung epithelia [40]. Similarly, in the respiratory tract of chickens, not all mucosal cells are responsive to chIFN-\u03bb. Therefore, treatments can only delay, but do not significantly support the complete removal of viral loads of H5N1 or halt the virus crossing the epithelial barrier [41]. However, for low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), it is evident that chIFN-\u03bb has demonstrated significant antiviral activities [42]. Recent reports revealed another contrasting feature of IFN-\u03bb, where it significantly elicited strong antiviral potential on intestinal epithelial cells to control murine rotaviruses [43,44]. It will be fascinating to investigate in the future whether the same antiviral phenomena occurs, and chIFN-\u03bb might also demonstrate epitheliotropism like rotaviruses and halt viral pathogens of the gastrointestinal tract in chickens.",

Notably, the upregulation of NF-KB in response to chIFN-\u03bb treatment on CEF signifies their potent role in the immune response. Activator protein 1 (AP-1) is a transcription factor complex highly responsive for cytokine signaling and growth promotion [46]. Formed through noncovalent dimerization between the FOS and JUN family of nuclear oncogenes, this complex activates AP-1-dependent genes, hence controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [47]. Consistent with these observations, our study demonstrated that many genes associated with this pathway were upregulated. This finding suggests a link between AP1 and the transcriptional cascade associated with recombinant interferon treatment. Overall, transcriptomic analysis revealed significant upregulation of FOS and JUN in CEF and bursa, and thymus of chicken.",
