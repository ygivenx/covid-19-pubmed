Whether these new types represent truly new strains or simply recombination events without clinical significance, needs to be further investigated. Respiratory diseases are generally associated with species B (serotypes 3 and 7), C (serotypes 1, 2, and 5), and E (serotype 4) viruses, whereas viruses in species F cause gastroenteritis, and viruses in subspecies D are often associated with keratoconjunctivitis. A study from Cuba recently reported that species D can also be isolated in respiratory specimens as a dominant genotype [14]. In China, AdV3 and AdV7 have been reported as causative agents in epidemic outbreaks of respiratory disease. In 2009, a study from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported an HAdV acute respiratory disease outbreak in Qishan, Shanxi Province, and AdV55 (QS-DLL), a new adenovirus not previously reported worldwide, was identified as the cause of these infections. The novel HAdV was shown to arise from a hexon recombination between AdV11 and AdV14 [11]. This outbreak of AdV55 in China prompted us to review HAdV-associated ARTIs in Lanzhou City, China.",

Serotypes 1\u20133, 5, and 7 are frequently recovered from children with ARTIs, but outbreaks of severe infections in healthy children are most frequently reported with AdV7, followed by AdV3 and AdV21 [3,27,28]. In hospitalized Korean children with LRTIs due to HAdV, the serotypes recovered most frequently between 1990 and 1998 were AdV7 (41%), AdV3 (15%), and AdV2 (15%) [3]. A two-decade study from Taiwan showed that AdV3 and AdV7 were the major detected types; AdV3 was consistently isolated throughout the survey period [29]. HAdV types 3 and 7 are also two of the most important etiological agents of pneumonia in China; a previous study from China showed that AdV3 was the most prevalent genome type in children with pneumonia over the 27-year period from 1962 to 1988[27]. AdV3 and AdV7 accounted for 69\u2013100% of HAdV strains isolated from patients with pneumonia in Beijing, China [27]. In the present study, six serotypes (types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 11) were observed between November 2006 and November 2009 in Lanzhou City, China. AdV3 was predominant during this period, accounting for 78.38% of HAdV. Genome recombination plays an important role in the molecular evolution of HAdV, leading to newly emerging strains that have tropism changes or become virulent [8-13,30]. Interestingly, recombination between AdV11 and AdV14 was found in our AdV11 isolates. AdV11, which has rarely been reported worldwide in ARTIs, accounted for 13.51% of HAdV isolates in our study. AdV14, which belongs to the species B2 , has been reported to cause outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in many places recently [31]. AdV11, which also belongs to subgenus B2, was isolated more frequently in China between 1965 and 1985 [32]. Since then, AdV11 infections had not been reported for more than 20 years until an acute respiratory outbreak caused by AdV55, showing a hexon recombination between AdV11 and AdV14, occurred in Shanxi Province, China, in the spring of 2008. Our study confirmed that AdV55 was present and circulating in Lanzhou, China.",

These results are consistent with those of studies from Greater Manchester, UK, and Korea, which also revealed that most HAdV infections occurred among children less than 5 years of age [33]. However, in the present study, HAdVs infection was also found in 11 infants younger than 6 months, including two newborns. This result is in contrast to that of a previous study from Taiwan, which found that all HAdVs-positive patients except one infant were older than 6 months [34]; this phenomenon was explained by the reasoning that infants < 6 months of age are normally protected by maternal antibodies, although the exact mechanism requires further study. Our study also revealed that patients with AdV3 were significantly older than patients infected with other virus types (median age, 30 vs. 8 months), which is also consistent with a previous study from Taiwan. Males were more frequently infected than females with all HAdV serotypes in our study, which is also consistent with the results of a previous study [1]. All of these issues require further study.",

Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the frequency of URTI and LRTI between the RSV group and HAdV group, and a greater frequency of URTIs in HAdV group. Most LRTIs caused by HAdV are mild and indistinguishable from LRTIs caused by other respiratory viruses; however, HAdV can result in fatal outcomes or residual sequelae. In a previous study from Buenos Aires, Argentina, the overall fatality rate during hospitalization of patients with AdV7 reached 28.6%. Another study from China conducted over a 33-year period (1958\u20131990) reported a 15.5% fatality rate of HAdV-associated infantile pneumonia. The symptoms manifested during infection with AdV3 and AdV7 have become less severe since the mid-1980s, and no fatal case has been reported since 1986 [27]. In our 3-year study, the RTIs associated with AdV3 resulted in no mortality. This finding could be because of a stabilization of the circulating HAdV type 3 in China, with subsequent increases in herd immunity and reductions in HAdV infections. AdV7 is most frequently reported elsewhere and may be related to severe infections in healthy children [3]. In the present study, only two patients were AdV7-positive; pleural effusions and homogenous consolidation were identified on chest radiographs in one of these patients, with negative results by bacterial culturing. AdV11, which has rarely been reported in respiratory specimens, was second in frequency only to AdV3 in this study and was detected in 14.86% of AdV-positive samples. Sample LZY153, which was confirmed to contain the new AdV55 genotype with hexon recombination between AdV11 and AdV14, was collected in February 2009 from a 12-month-old boy who was admitted to the hospital because of bronchitis and eventually recovered. Given that our sample contained only one confirmed AdV55 case, the clinical significance of this genotype is difficult to analyze. Furthermore, interpretation of the general impact of HAdV infection is also restricted by the difficulty of patient follow-up for the detection of lung sequelae. Long-term surveillance of infection with different HAdV genotypes, especially newly identified genotypes, is needed to explore their clinical effects.",

AdV 55 has been confirmed as a novel recombinant between AdV-11 and AdV-14 at the hexon gene [10]. And it is difficult to identify the other nine AdV11-positive samples as AdV55 by the short fragment of the hexon gene. However, this novel recombinant AdV55 needs further study to explore its clinical significance after more cases with AdV55 were reported and confirmed.",

The incidence of HAdV infection peaked in children aged 3\u20137 years, but a relatively high infection rate (3.29%) was observed in infants younger than 6 months, which should be given more attention. Further molecular surveillance of HAdV should be undertaken continuously to explore their epidemiological and clinical characteristics.",
