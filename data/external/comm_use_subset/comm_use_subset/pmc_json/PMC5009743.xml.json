To an unknown extent, selection has presumably operated to generate features for avoidance of mRNA instability associated with the terminator in either of the utilized frames that is closest to the start codon. Avoidance is likely most relevant when the great majority of ribosomes are in the frame that leads to termination at the first terminator in either frame. Given the complexity of mRNA degradation and difference between the major classes of organisms, there is probably a diversity of answers with cytoplasmic transcription for many RNA viruses also being relevant. Parallels to the diversity of stabilities of internal UGA-containing selenoprotein mRNAs may emerge. However, attention is drawn to a sequence shortly after a frameshift site and 3\u2032 adjacent to a relevant stop codon, that binds a polypyrimidine tract binding protein that competes with UPF1 (20,21), a component of the nonsense mediated decay system. A more questionably relevant case involves the very different organization of an RNA virus genome whose decoding involves shifts into both alternative frames (22,23).",

Numerous high level frameshifting candidates for this have been identified (24\u201326). Many are not phylogenetically conserved, making it difficult to assess overall significance especially as the situation is different from where selection acts via the protein product. However, in some cases experimental analysis has yielded provocative insights as, for instance with the human CCR5 cytokine receptor that acts as a HIV-1 co-receptor with implications for other cytokine receptor mRNAs, especially interleukin receptor subunit mRNAs (27,28). This particular example is present from humans to lemurs. As a counterpoint to consequences of termination by frameshifted ribosomes, there can be dramatic effects of not having any stop codon in the new frame, as illustrated by a viral case (6). On bacterial mRNAs lacking stop codons, tmRNA-mediated shifting of translation onto its own internal sequence is associated with both mRNA degradation (29) as well as abberant protein destabilization. (Utilization of frameshifting to lead to the unwinding of stem loops to permit downstream initiation is dealt with below.)",

The consequences of framing infidelity in synthesizing such giant proteins as titin is greater than that for small proteins because of loss due to premature termination by frameshifted ribosomes, but there is currently no evidence for extra long ORF framing fidelity enhancement. In contrast many missense errors are inconsequential. The other extreme is the possibility of ribosomal frameshifting being frequent and \u223c100% efficient.

The frameshifting can result in zero frame product being fused to functionally important domains encoded by the new frame. With E. coli release factor 2 mRNA, the functionally important part of the product is synthesized from the new frame by frameshifted ribosomes (refs. below). Though it has not been experimentally investigated, there may be counterpart \u22121 frameshifting early in the decoding of phage \u03bb cI mRNAs where it is the short frameshift product that is rapidly degraded and the act of its synthesis serving as a \u2018ribosome sink\u2019 (57), perhaps analogous to that, probably for a different regulatory purpose, in decoding some cardioviruses (58,59). In contrast, the function of frameshifting can be unrelated to products of the overlapping ORFs on which the frameshifting occurs. Though long postulated (60), a bacterial case has recently been discovered where translation of a short zero frame leads to ribosomes frameshifting and their continued progression in the new frame affecting significant mRNA structure. In this instance, the consequence is allowing initiation of synthesis of an important downstream encoded protein (61).",

Where the efficiency of transition to the alternative frame is close to 50%, a single nucleotide change can reverse the roles with longer product being derived from frameshifting almost at the end of the ORF yielding the shorter product. An example is bacterial dnaX, see below, which illustrates the relevance of efficiency to location.

However, it can occur with utilization of a different type of recoding. With a different retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus, the downstream pol ORF is accessed by a few per cent of ribosomes reading through the gag terminator with near-cognate decoding of the stop codon. While some retroviruses utilize just a single such \u22121 ribosomal frameshift, certain others utilize two \u22121 frameshift events (62) and in these the first one is more efficient.

However, despite breakthrough discoveries of frameshifting with many retroviruses and plant viruses, and even with intensive study over decades, it is only recently that frameshift utilization has been found in many important small to medium sized RNA viruses. This advance has depended on the development of relatively new comparative genomic algorithms to discern overlapping functional elements embedded within protein-coding sequences (70\u201372). RNA virus sequences diverge rapidly and, for medically or economically important species, there are frequently many sequenced isolates available, enabling (often even within a single virus species) the statistically significant detection of very short overlapping coding sequences and the RNA elements that direct their translation.

            "text": "Despite early work with phages MS2 and T7 (73\u201375), it was the discovery by Jacks and Varmus of ribosomal frameshifting near the end of the gag gene of the alpha retrovirus, Rous sarcoma virus, that sparked widespread interest in viral frameshifting (76). A total of 5% of ribosomes translating gag shift to the \u22121 pol reading frame to synthesize the GagPol precursor that upon cleavage is the source of reverse transcriptase, an endonuclease and a specific protease (Pro) (Figure 2). Those ribosomes that do not frameshift quickly terminate at the end of gag. The double-stranded RNA totivirus, L-A, present in killer strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae, and a variant L-A-lus in wine yeasts, use counterpart frameshifting (the effects of the killer toxin were originally noted by L. Pasteur). Its efficiency is substantially lower (77\u201381). Red clover powdery mildew-associated totiviruses have a related frameshift cassette (82). A \u22121 frameshift event is also involved in the synthesis of the HIV 1 and 2 GagPol precursor. With all these retroviruses, the viral encoded protease involved in polyprotein cleavage is encoded from the 5\u2032 part of the pol gene and so is in-frame with the reverse transcriptase encoding sequence. However, in both mouse mammary tumor virus and human T-cell lymphotropic retroviruses (83) (beta- and deltaretroviruses respectively), a second frameshift event occurs at the end of the protease encoding sequence, pro, permitting entry to the third and pol-encoding frame. This results in the synthesis of both GagPro and GagProPol precursors. The overall efficiency of GagProPol still has to be ca. 2% to 5% (for one at the low end of this range, the efficiencies of the respective frameshifting events are 23% and 8% (62,84) (Figure 3A). The defective endogenous retroviruses, Intracisternal A-type particles (IAP) that accumulate in endoplasmic reticulae, also use two efficient separate frameshift events to synthesize their GagProPol (85,86). Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), which is highly expressed in some cancers such as colorectal carcinoma (87), utilizes efficient frameshifting (88). Having the reverse transcriptase being part of a Pol precursor with the Gag capsid components, facilitates its packaging into virions and in an inactive form (89). [It has been proposed that HIV Gag-Pol frameshifting is linked to selective viral encapsidation (90), but this has been challenged (91).",

            "text": "Shortly after the discovery of splicing in 1977, it was widely suspected that it was involved in generating an mRNA from which GagPol was synthesized by standard decoding. However, suggestive evidence was quickly obtained that for the gammaretrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus, whose pol is in the same frame as its gag, stop codon readthrough was involved and this was confirmed in 1985 (92,93). By 1984 two groups were testing whether frameshifting was involved in retroviruses where pol is in the \u22121 frame with respect to gag. A dilemma faced by both groups at the time was how to distinguish between a low level of ribosomal frameshifting and polymerase slippage (related to acknowledgements in (76)). The initial \u2018proof\u2019 for retroviral gag- frameshifting being ribosomal rather than due to standard decoding of altered RNA arising from polymerase slippage, was the reported absence of fusion-derived product in E. coli cell-free protein synthesis programmed with SP6 transcripts that yielded fusion product in reticulocyte lysates (76). However, cassettes with the gag-pol shift region do exhibit frameshifting in such systems with \u223c40% of the efficiency shown in mammalian systems (94\u201398). Ironically for one of us, current in vitro work is revealing a modest level of HIV reverse transcriptase realignment (slippage) at the same 7 nt shift site at which the ribosomal frameshifting that yields GagPol occurs, to yield product with an extra base or lacking a base. This polymerase slippage is influenced by the ratio of two of the 4 dNTPs (C. Penno, P.V.B. and J.F.A. unpublished) (and possibly by an RNA structural feature different from that recently described (99)). dNTP depletion is part of the hosts response to viral infection and lentiviruses, such as HIV-2, have developed a vpx gene to counteract this effect (100,101). The problem with the control in the initial published work on retroviral frameshifting (76) does not detract from its great importance and the elegance of both it and the subsequent work by the same group including the discovery of heptanucleotide \u22121 frameshift sites to which 2 tRNAs could pair in alternative frames (102). A similar comment also pertains to the relatively recent finding that a proportion of the HIV frameshifting products are due to \u22122 rather than \u22121 frameshifting (98).",

In humans, they are important causes of childhood gastroenteritis. Others use +1 or \u22122 frameshifting for the same purpose, e.g. Leishmania virus 1, and Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 (family Totiviridae, with other members of the same family using \u22121 frameshifting or reinitiation to express polymerase). As the efficiency of this +1 frameshifting can be low, its experimental analysis is sometimes difficult. Curiously, different members of the family Closteroviridae, plant viruses with among the largest RNA genomes, appear to use shifting to the +1 frame at different distances from the terminator, to synthesize their RNA dependent RNA polymerase but further work is needed (113,114) and contrast in (115).",

This is illustrated by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) whose small positive-sense single-stranded RNA was widely used as a model mRNA in early eukaryotic cell-free protein synthesis studies. Its \u22121 frameshifting mediates synthesis of a functionally important protein that has just 11 or 12 N-terminal amino acids encoded by the zero frame and 117 amino acids encoded from the new frame \u2018internal\u2019 ORF (58) (Figure 3B). For the related Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the trans-frame encoded protein is just 14 amino acids, 6 encoded by the zero frame and 8 by the new frame (58,59). Its frameshifting is a remarkable 74\u201382% efficient. It serves to divert most ribosomes to termination and allow only a greatly reduced number to continue for downstream encoded protein synthesis (a ribosome \u2018sink\u2019 function for frameshifting) (59). Such a \u2018sink\u2019 function may be ancestral in EMCV progenitors to the product of new frame translation acquiring a function.

The Japanese encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses utilize frameshifting that has significant consequences for viral neuroinvasiveness (120\u2013122). Many insect specific flaviviruses also utilize frameshifting in their expression (119,123,124), and some of these flaviviruses have major effects on medically important flaviviruses co-infecting the same mosquito cells. Not only does the frameshifting result in the synthesis of additional functional proteins, in some species it diverts a substantial proportion of ribosomes from synthesizing 3\u2032 encoded replicative proteins. This permits quicker recycling of ribosomes for synthesis of further 5\u2032 encoded structural proteins, and downregulates polymerase synthesis.

The directionality of the shift, +1, is different from that used by the viruses considered above, all of which are \u22121. While sites utilized for +1 frameshifting 5\u2032 adjacent to stop codons were previously known in chromosomal gene expression, +1 frameshift sites at internal positions are notoriously difficult to spot. The previously unrecognized type of site utilized by influenza A virus has provided guides for spotting the sites of other occurrences of +1 frameshifting including that for important chronic bee paralysis virus, related viruses such as Lake Sinai virus (125) and members of the Amalgaviridae family (126). Influenza A virus is a single-stranded negative-sense, segmented RNA virus and the frameshifting occurs in decoding its segment 3. This segment yields a single mRNA that encodes a subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The frameshift-derived product, PA-X, has the same endonuclease domain as the polymerase subunit but lacks the C-terminal region needed for association with other subunits. Key amino acids encoded by the frameshift-derived segment that are important for the host shut-off function have already been identified (127). In some viral strains the +1 frame encoded C-terminal extension is 41 amino acids and in others it is 61 (39). There is evidence for host species specificity with increasing prevelance of the shorter form in pigs for characterized reasons (128). Potential significance derives from avian influenza viruses infecting pigs that serve as \u2018mixing vessels\u2019 for the generation of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Effects of PA-X on depletion of poly(A) RNA (129), and in particular on specific host RNA polymerase II transcripts (130), have been characterized. Though strain-specific (131), for some viral strains PA-X deficient viruses display higher virulence in mice than isogenic WT viruses (39,131), in contrast to the effects of disabling several other cases of viral frameshifting. No signals for stimulating frameshifting at the shift site are evident and correspondingly the level of frameshifting is very low. It is salutory that despite this very low level of the frameshifting, the frameshift derived product significantly modulates host expression. Its loss leads to changes in the kinetics of the global host response including increases in inflammatory, apoptotic and T lymphocyte-signaling pathways (39).",

A trans-acting viral protein is required for frameshift stimulation (23,133). This frameshifting is in addition to the long known programmed \u22121 frameshifting that occurs several kilobases 3\u2032 of the new frameshift site (Figure 3C). The classical site, which was first identified in equine arteritis virus, is at the end of the long 5\u2032 coding sequence, ORF1a and frameshifting at it expresses a much longer replicase precursor polyprotein (134,135). The newly discovered frameshift site mediates both \u22121 and \u22122 frameshifting (22,23). The C-terminal region derived from the new frame after \u22122 frameshifting is relatively short but does have an alternative transmembrane region and is targeted to a different subcellular compartment. In the economically important pig virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, inactivation of the \u22122 frameshift product results in a 50 to 100-fold reduction in replication efficiency in cell culture (22), with the product down-regulating Swine Leukocyte Antigen class I (136). The ribosomes that shift \u22121 instead of \u22122 at the same site, immediately encounter a stop codon and terminate (23).",

The enigma was resolved with the surprising discovery that one member of the doublet, a virion components, was a completely distinct protein TF (\u2018TransFrame\u2019), derived from \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (137). The C-terminal one third of TF encoded by the \u22121 frame is hydrophilic in contrast to the hydrophobic C-terminus of the \u20186K\u2019 product of standard decoding. TF has a significant function as in a mouse neuropathogenesis model, the mortality of virus with mutant frameshift product was <15% compared to 95% with animal infected with WT virus (138), and another mouse study has also shown substantial effects (139).

It is a levivirus. Though members of this genus are not as small as the mitochondrial-infecting mitoviruses and other members of the family Narnaviridae, their genomes are among the smallest for RNA viruses. The replicase of both the single-stranded phages MS2 and Q\u03b2 is composed of three host translational components and one viral encoded component often termed synthetase. Synthetase is encoded by the gene closest to the 3\u2032 end of the positive-sense genomes that acts as mRNA. The termination codon of the gene for the 66 kDa Q\u03b2 synthetase is substantially closer than its MS2 counterpart to the 3\u2032 end from which replicase commences synthesis of the negative strand. Though there is minimal space between MS2 genes, the termination codon for its 62 kDa MS2 synthetase product is 174 nt from the 3\u2032 end of its genome. Functional MS2 replicase likely assembles from components of the translation apparatus terminating synthesis of the synthetase and acts in cis on the nearby 3\u2032 end of the RNA \u2013 unlike its Q\u03b2 counterpart it cannot be isolated in a functional state free from its RNA. Cell free protein synthesis studies revealed that \u22121 frameshifting yields a small proportion of MS2 synthetase of similar size as its Q\u03b2 counterpart due to termination 63\u201361 nts from the 3\u2032 end of MS2 RNA (73,75). Product of this size has not been detected in vivo whether for lability or other reasons. It has not been determined whether the frameshifting has functional significance, but because of the short generation time and large progeny yield, the intense selection could have favored even very subtle effects.",

Neither product is present in the mature virions. The product of standard translation gpG, and the corresponding part of the longer and frameshift-derived gpGT product bind to the tail length measure protein, to form a complex with many molecules of gpG per single molecule of gpGT. The \u22121 frame encoded T domain binds to the major tail shaft subunit and may recruit it to polymerize around the tape measure protein which then determines its length (41) \u223c192 copies of the major tail subunit protein are in the final structure (Figure 4). This low-level \u2019G-T\u2019 frameshifting is widely conserved among other long tailed dsDNA phages, except T4, despite low sequence similarity of the respective ORFs of the different phages. However, in P2 and related phages the frameshift efficiency is 2- to 3-fold higher (141). Counterpart \u22121 frameshifting also appears to be utilized by the siphoviruses\nHaloarcula vallismortis tailed virus 1 (HVTV-1) and three Haloarcula californiae viruses (HCTV-1, 2 and 5) that infect halophilic archaea, though that used by the myovirus Halorubrum sodomense tailed virus 2 (HSTV-2) is very likely +1 frameshifting (48,49).

An occurrence of this type of frameshifting to yield an extension of the major coat protein of phage T3 results in two products from one gene in the viral capsid (150). Curiously the counterpart extension in the close relative phage T7 (74,151,152) is not an Ig-like domain. With phage T3, and others such as Lactobacillus phage A2 (145,146), the Ig-like extension derives from \u22121 frameshifting. With Listeria phages A118 and A500 \u22121 frameshifting also occurs in decoding a coat protein gene, though in phage PSA it is +1 (Figure 3D). In all 3 phages additionally +1 frameshifting is utilized to derive a second product from the major tail protein gene (153,154). Apparent indifference to whether the frameshifting is +1 or \u22121, or even whether frameshifting is involved to yield the Ig-like extension instead of in-frame decoding, has reasonably been suggested to reflect chance. Dynamic movement of Ig-like domains via non-homologous recombination would land some in-frame and some out-of-frame with selection for function in the latter cases sometimes resulting in expression via frameshifting (155).",

            "text": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus are human DNA tumor viruses that diverged over 80 million years ago. Each expresses from a single gene a minute amount of the multifunctional products, LANA 1 and EBNA 1, respectively, important for several purposes including maintenance of viral episomes, regulation of viral latency and impairment of cell-cycle checkpoints. The products have a central repeat region that plays a role in the evasion of host immuno surveillance. While classical studies have focused on the products present in the nucleus, recently product from KSHV has been detected in the cytoplasm (156). The zero frame of the Epstein-Barr virus repeat region contains glycine and alanine, GA, codons and that of KSHV is rich in glutamine and glutamic acid, QE, codons. Although there is limited overall nucleotide sequence similarity between the two viruses, their repeat region sequence is highly similar though offset in terms of respective reading frames by 1 nt. A nested open reading frame in EBNA-1 mRNA encodes a protein capable of inhibiting antigen presentation in cis (157). An efficient switch, or perhaps multiple switches, to the +1 frame with respect to the genomic sequence, during expression of the EBV sequence yields a product that has \u223c35% identity to the product of its KSHV zero frame counterpart (1). The product of a synthetic EBV construct designed to express what would normally be the +1 frame, inhibits antigen presenetation in cis, consistent with functional relevance of the frameshift derived product which is substantially present in the cytoplasm. Switching to the +1 frame, which also could be by a \u22122 event, occurs in the expression of the KSHV repeat sequence and it generates a highly repetitive SR-rich peptide with a distinctive subnuclear localization pattern. Whether a switch to the \u22121 frame, to yield a GA-rich product, also occurs in the expression of KSHV is unknown, and relevant to whether there is any significance to what is the zero frame in the coding sequence. This situation has interesting relevance to the incidental but important frameshifting in the expression of repeat sequences involved in certain human neurodegenerative degenerative disease (see below). The special cases of mutant herpes viruses using frameshifting to counteract therapeutic drugs is also considered below.",

(159) in their famous experiment establishing sequential reading of adjacent non-overlapping codons! There is a 50 nt insert between codons 46 and 47 of gene 60 (55) that may be derived from a degenerate group I intron that provided protection against cleavage by the nuclease involved in the spread of the 5\u2032 homing endonuclease (158). These 50 nts are non-coding and efficiently translationally bypassed in a process that yields a product from two disjointed and out-of-frame ORFs (55,160). The Streptomyces phage Hau3 may also use bypassing in expression of its terminase protein (161), but, if so, rather than using it to bypass a deleterious insert, it may avail of unusual features associated with its host's decoding the codon UUA (162).",

            "text": "The non-segmented negative-stranded RNA viruses, measles, mumps and Sendai (and other viruses in the same subfamily Paramyxovirinae), and also Ebola (family Filoviridae), utilize what, after many alternatives, a key investigator is now calling programmed transcriptional frameshifting (PTF) (163) to yield additional product(s) that are trans-frame encoded with respect to genomic sequence. In bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 this is manifested in a \u223c300 nt stretch of its P-gene being translated in all three frames. The P protein of these viruses is essential for activity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. In Sendai and measles viruses, a slippage event at a specific site by polymerase transcribing the middle of the P gene results in 30% of the mRNA having a single \u2018extra\u2019 G (i.e. one more G in the product than the corresponding number of Cs in the template). This mRNA encodes the V protein that neutralizes host defences. For the mumps-like viruses (genus Rubulavirus) where the mRNA derived from standard transcription encodes the V rather than the P protein, 2 Gs are inserted at high frequency with the resultant mRNAs encoding the P protein. The pattern of G inserts for each virus reflects their respective ORF possibilities, and they have a mechanism to ensure that RNA with G inserts is not packaged into virions. In contrast, Ebola virus slippage occurs during transcription of its non-structural glycoprotein gene to yield transcripts without inserts and with one or two additional As in the ratio 70, 25 and 5% that encode soluble glycoprotein, transmembrane glycoprotein and small soluble glycoprotein, respectively (164\u2013166). A knockout of the slippage site in a recombinant Zaire ebolavirus significantly increased cytopathogenicity indicating a role for slippage products in reducing early cytotoxicity (165,167).",

            "text": "Potyviruses may cause more than 30% of all plant losses due to viruses and cause immense monetary loss and wasted fuel in intensive agriculture, a figure of $20 billion per annum has been cited (168). Regardless of the monetary figures, they cause severe hardship and starvation for many on subsistence agriculture. In contrast, a potyvirus caused the highly prized pattern on tulips that triggered the first economic boom bust \u2018mania\u2019 in Europe (in the 1600s), and tests for potyviruses in orchids are lucrative (Figure 5). Until recently the small single-stranded RNA genome was though to have a single ORF that encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved to yield functional proteins. However, there is a short overlapping ORF, pipo, that is decoded as the C-terminal end of a fusion protein P3N-PIPO (169) which mediates virus movement in plants (168,170) and is relevant to overcoming host resistance (171) and jumps in plant host range (172). Though it was initially suspected that PIPO coding sequence was accessed by ribosomal frameshifting, it is instead specific viral polymerase slippage, with insertion of a single additional base relative to the template, followed by standard translation, that yields the additional product (42\u201344). Irrespective of the outcome of future work to determine whether the slippage events occur during synthesis of the minus-strand replicative intermediate or the plus-strand progeny genome, the mRNA with the single extra base behaves as a novel sort of sub-genomic (actually, super-genomic) RNA. The requirement for synthesis of a complete polyprotein to confer cis-replication competence (173) has been suggested to mean that the RNA from which PIPO is translated, is not amplified (42). With turnip mosaic virus, the amount of deletional or +2 slippage, was very low so the amount of expression from the +1 frame was very small. However, with clover yellow vein virus, a product with its C-terminal 5AA encoded from the +1 frame, and derived from transcriptional slippage at the same site, has been detected, and shown, like P3N-PIPO, to function in cell-to-cell movement (174) (Figure 5B). Four related potyviruses infecting sweet potato utilize an additional slippage site at a different location to permit access to a second overlapping ORF and synthesis of a \u2018transframe\u2019 product that uniquely inhibits short-distance movement of an RNA silencing signal (175,176).",

At present it appears that decoding of a substantial majority of all cellular and viral genomes likely productively utilizes frameshifting (inclusion of bacterial viruses is relevant). Viruses, especially RNA viruses, and other mobile elements, have comparatively small genomes, and the prelevance of frameshift utilization appears more striking than in much larger cellular genomes. As compact genomes, expecially those whose expression does not involve splicing, richly use translational versatility and controls, it is not surprising that frameshift utilization is no exception. Utilization of at least one frameshifting event in RNA virus decoding is almost more the rule than the exception. With the ongoing application of deep sequencing to viruses of terrestrial invertebrates, marine species of all types and to bacteria plus archaea in numerous isolated deep sub-surface niches, knowledge of instances of viral frameshifting seems certain to expand (with at least the bacterial and achaeal genomes providing prophage/integrated viral genome information).",

Sometimes they are present in only one or a few copies per bacterium, but up to more than a thousand in some cyanobacteria (182). The over 4000 known different IS elements have been classified into several families (183). While use of a frameshift event occurs in the decoding of the IS1 (184), IS3 (185,186), IS5 and IS630 families, it is very common in the IS3 family, which comprises 27% of the known IS elements (187). Frameshifting serves to fuse the product of an upstream ORF, which generally encodes a DNA-binding protein that can on its own, act as a regulator, with a catalytic domain encoded by a partially overlapping downstream ORF that is often in the \u22121 frame (Figure 6). The fusion has the transposase activity. Where tested, the level of frameshifting was found to determine the level of transposition (188,189). As a low level of transposase is optimal to minimize insertion-mediated host gene disruption, the frameshifting level is generally low. This mostly affects transposition frequency of the same IS element rather than copies of the same element located elsewhere on the chromosome, since transposase has a strong cis preference. This is related to the frameshifting itself since an associated pause signal influences cis preference presumably by facilitating sequential folding and cotranslational binding of the transposase (190,191).",

Naturally occurring non-symbiotic mesorhizobia that receive one of the well-studied elements, 502 kb ICE-MlSymR7A, via conjugation can communicate interactively with the pasture legume commonly known as bird's-foot trefoil or deervetch (Lotus corniculatus), leading to the formation of bacteroids that fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (200). Countervailing the potential population benefit of new endosymbiont formation is selection against disadvantageous occurrence to the original host of the element excision. Excision results in circularization and rolling circle replication. The element can be maintained in the multi-copy extrachromosomal state at energetic cost to the host, and in this state it has greater transfer propensity. For the vast majority of cells carrying the ICE element, this cost does not arise since in WT laboratory M. loti strain R7A, the excised state is only observed in 0.06% of log-phase and 6% of stationary phase cells with only \u223c3 in 10 million cells acting as transfer donor. A quorum sensing system keeps the process at a very low level but when derepressed excision can occur in 40\u2013100% of cells and the transfer rate can increase 1000-fold. The ICE element encodes components responsible for a complex system of activators and repressors for quorum sensing and also components of the excision system responsive to it (201). Crucial for excision is a product expressed from genes msi172 and msi171. Plus one ribosomal frameshifting near the 3\u2032 end of the msi172 coding sequence causes ribosomes to enter the msi171 ORF and synthesize Frameshifted excision activator, FseA, a master transcriptional activator of the excision system. Perhaps to modulate leaky expression, FseA itself is subject to binding and inhibition by a quorum-sensing antiactivator (202). This antiactivator's own expression is bimodal so that individual cells are either \u2018on\u2019 of \u2018off\u2019 for propensity for ICE excision. This has been proposed to be part of a \u2018bet-hedging\u2019 strategy in which only a small proportion of cells in a population are sensitive to induction of excision, with potentially deleterious consequences for those cells but potentially beneficial cell population benefits. In this scenario frameshift utilization is part of the scheme for dampening biological noise present in a quorum-sensing auroinduction circuit and ensuring that excision is not spuriously induced. Ramsay, Ronson and colleagues who discovered the frameshifting involved, anticipate that nutrient availability likely contributes to the proportion of cells that enter the \u2018on\u2019 state, with frameshift efficiency being a sensor (201,202). Identification of the potential for frameshifting in similar genes in other elements suggests more widespread utilization (202) but the extent of this awaits investigation.",

            "text": "The studies of Phil Farabaugh's group on the expression of Transposons of yeast, Ty elements, is a classic in the study of +1 frameshifting and is pertinent for other +1 S. cerevisiae frameshifting. In contrast to IS element usage of \u22121 frameshifting, S. cerevisiae Ty1, 2, 3 and 4 retroelements utilize +1 frameshifting near the 3\u2032 end of their gag-homologue gene to synthesize the GagPol polyprotein from which Pol and ultimately reverse transcriptase, is derived. Ty1 and Ty3 are present in up to 30 copies and 1\u20135 copies per cell, respectively, and their frameshifting is distinctive. Ty1 frameshifting was discovered at an early stage (206\u2013208). It utilizes a highly shift-prone site; 40% frameshifting was recorded with reporter constructs (209). Yet its ratio of GagPol to Gag is only 3% (210), much closer to that of other mobile elements. After the cap at the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA there is a pseudoknot that includes the start of the coding sequence but it serves to only modestly reduce the level of gag translation (211). Though it does not yield accurate quantitation, the results from ribosome profiling for both Ty1 and another gene, ABP140, with the same shift site in their native chromosomal states clearly point toward the efficiency deduced from the reporter construct work ((212); A. Michel and PVB, unpublished). The discrepancy for Ty1 between 40% frameshifting and the much lower ratio of GagPol to Gag is currently ascribed to either a translational elongation effect in decoding the downstream pol gene, or reduced stability of GagPol compared to Gag (213). The frameshifting utilized by another Ty element, Ty3 is mechanistically quite distinct (214,215). Its frameshifting is not a constitutive process but is regulated over a 10-fold response window depending on carbon source. The glucose-signaling pathway involved has been investigated in depth (216).",

Most were in D. melanogaster and none were in C. elegans. Only 2 of the 51 had pol in the +1 frame whereas in fungi the proportion using +1 compared to \u22121 was less skewed. At that time just two different types of plant elements were found to have gag and pol in separate frames and in both pol was in the +1 frame. One has a gag pol overlap of 310 nts. The other type is a set of sirevirus retrotransposons that comprise two sub-sets, one of which has a simple gag pol overlap. However, the second sub-set has a conserved UAG in the pol frame 10 nts 3\u2032 of the gag terminator. Both sub-sets from both monocots, and dicots have a conserved sequence motif of 27 nts that can form an 11-bp stem containing covariant nucleotides and capped by a 4-nt loop (217).

The frameshifting occurs at a very high level, 60%, in the later stages of developing placenta and is likely important (221). Knock-out mutants of PEG10 are lethal at an early embryonic stage and PEG10 products have numerous effects including inhibiting apoptosis and mediating cell proliferation (222,223).

A three-protein preassembly complex is present in most of the cell cycle and late in the cycle, after completion of DNA replication, Est3 binds to form active telomerase, which is quickly disassembled by a different pathway. Est3-mediated limitation of the time of formation and quantity of telomerase to a low level may be important for avoidance of telomerase acting at double-strand breaks where it could prevent repair that would restore genome integrity (238). The +1 frameshifting occurs at a shift site similar to that of Ty1 just before a UGA terminator at codon 94. trans-frame encoded Est3 is 181 amino acids. The surface of Est3 that interacts with the telomerase RNP pre-assembly complex, the \u2018TEL\u2019 patch is similar to that of mammalian protein TPP1 (239,240), and is encoded downstream of the shift site (240). Under the conditions tested, the frameshift efficiency is high in part due to an 8-fold stimulation by a 3\u2032 modular 27-nt stimulatory sequence (237,241). Even though a mutation putting the coding sequence into a single frame had no discernible effect on growth in lab media (237), function is evident because of conservation, including of the 3\u2032 stimulator, in diverse budding yeast for 150 million years (242).",

In frameshifted cell wall genes of an endosymbiont associated with aphids, and a histidine biosynthetic gene of an endosymbiont associated with ants, frequent transcription slippage/realignment at long poly(A) runs yields 12\u201350% of transcripts with \u2018corrected\u2019 reading frames (244). The pathogenic kinetopast protists Trypanosoma and Leishmania have long been known to have mitochondrial uridine insertion/deletion type editing. But it also occurs in the mitochondria of endosymbiont kinetoplast Perkinsela where only six protein-coding genes have been identified despite the large size of the Perkinsela mitochondrial genome. Given the number of post-editing \u2018problem\u2019 mRNAs (245), potential translational \u2018correction\u2019 seems also likely. Ribosomal frameshifting can also compensate for the effects of otherwise inactivating single-nucleotide insertions at various places in the encoding DNA, and examples occur in the mitochondria of several free-living species. Single nucleotide inserts occur in a small number (currently 6 known) of essential genes in the mitochondria of species from 4 animal phyla and 1 protist. Compensatory +1 ribosomal frameshifting apparently yields an adequate amount of functional product (246). An insert occurs in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 gene of the majority of birds (247,248). The homologous gene in some turtles has the same insert and the insert likely originated in a common ancestor of birds and turtles more than 200 million years ago (246). In some other turtles the insert is elsewhere (246,248). An insert also occurs in the cytochrome b genes of at least one oyster species (249) and at any of several sites in this gene in several ant species (250). However, among the currently known instances, natural mitochondrial single-nucleotide frameshifting is most prevalent in glass sponges (251,252). These siliceous spicule-containing Hexactinellid sponges have exceptionally low metabolism, live in a low oxygen environment and their mitochondrial coding sequences show evidence of relaxed selection pressure (252). The coding sequence of mitochondrial genes of several calcium carbonate spicule-containing Calcaronean sponges is largely unrecognizable and their transcripts have single or double U insertions in pre-existing short poly(U) tracts (nearly all their genes on individual and likely linear chromosomes) (253). How the inserts occur and whether extensive compensatory (\u2018corrective\u2019) frameshifting is involved in the synthesis of their protein products is unknown.",

            "text": "The positively charged low molecular weight diamines and polyamines, putrescine, spermidine and spermine, occur in all cells. They play crucial roles in ion channels and many biochemical processes including transcription and translation (Figure 7). Not surprisingly, they have disease relevance (260). The over 80 000 publications listed in Pubmed are a reflection of the level of interest they have attracted. Though elevated levels occur in cancer cells, their levels are normally tightly controlled. A key regulator of intracellular polyamine levels is the protein antizyme whose existence was initially postulated as an \u2018anti-enzyme\u2019 inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase that catalyzes the synthesis of putrescine from which spermidine and ultimately spermine are derived (261). Despite considerable skepticism about the reality of its existence, and practical difficulties, a mammalian antizyme gene was cloned. Two partially overlapping reading frames were identified, and the protein sequence encoded by the frame junction region was determined (262,263). Not only is +1 frameshifting required for antizyme synthesis, the frameshifting is a very significant component of the regulatory repertoire (264\u2013268). There are three antizymes in mammals (see below), more in the fish, D. rerio (269\u2013271), and one in each species from Drosophila to C. elegans to S. cerevisiae yeast (272\u2013274). Frameshifting does not occur in the decoding of the antizyme gene from the ciliate Tetrahymena (270) where UGA is reassigned from being a stop codon. An antizyme gene is not present in extant plants. Binding of mammalian antizyme 1, but not antizymes 2 or 3, to an ornithine decarboxylase monomer causes a conformational change that, without the involvement of ubiquitination, targets the ornithine decarboxylase monomer for degradation by the 26S proteasome via its own C-terminal segment (275,276), and at least in S. cerevisiae the counterpart targeting is promoted by polyamine binding to antizyme (277). Polyamine binding to antizyme also influences ubiquitin-dependent degradation of antizyme itself (277), and antizyme has similarities to a key polyamine catabolic enzyme, spermidine/spermine N\u2010acetyltransferase, that directly binds polyamines.",

Instead of accelerating ATP citrate lyase degradation, antizyme performs an activating role. Cellular spermidine and spermine induce spermidine/spermine-N1- acetyltransferase which acetylates polyamines for catabolism or secretion. A regulatory circuit involving its substrate acetyl-CoA in downregulating spermidine and spermine through acetylation has been proposed. An influence on acetyl-CoA has wider implications, including for histone acetylation, and initial studies on cholesterol have been performed (287). Antizyme has also been reported to bind to Smad1, cyclin D1 and Aurora-A (288\u2013290), though there has been some controversy about this. A study of the binding sites of antizyme and cyclin D1 also revealed that binding affinity was 4-fold lower than for antizyme and ornithine decarboxylase (291) for which high resolution structural information is now available (276).",

            "text": "There is also a third mammalian antizyme, antizyme 3, and it is restricted to developing male germ cells (298,299). In contrast antizymes 1 and 2 are expressed in nearly all other cells where the requirement for polyamines may be lower. Functioning antizyme 3 is required for the rigid connection of sperm heads to tails and so for male fertility (300,301). A substantial proportion of the translation initiation on antizyme 3 mRNA is at an in-frame CUG codon further 5\u2032 with respect to the frameshift site than the AUG initiators for antizymes 1, 2 or 3, and so the product is N-terminally extended (301). Frequent termination at the stop codon 3\u2032 adjacent to the frameshift sites can result in synthesis of the ORF1 product, p12, that has a distinct separate activity. p12 interacts with myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 3 (MYPT3), a regulator of protein phosphatase 1\u03b2, and affects phosphatase activity (301). Expression of full-length antizyme 3 is very low, and at least in heterologous tissue culture cells the frameshifting efficiency is also very low (266). In marked contrast to antizymes 1 and 2, at what is expected to be standard expression levels, antizyme 3 has a stabilizing effect on it, probably by antagonizing antizyme inhibitor. Instead of targeting ornithine decarboxylase for degradation, antizyme 3 may serve to reversibly \u2018store\u2019 ornithine decarboxylase monomers (302). This mechanism would allow a much faster restoration of ornithine decarboxylase activity than any mechanism mediated by antizymes 1 or 2, as they require de novo synthesis of the protein (302).",

The tropical fresh water fish Danio rerio, and others of the minnow family, have a unique antizyme that is expressed in their retina and brain but absent in many other fish (271). Sequence inspection suggests that its frameshift recoding signals are weaker than the other antizyme mRNAs present in fish (or mammals other than antizyme 3) (271). As the levels of polyamines to which it is responsive are likely different from that of other antizymes, it will be interesting to see if its expression is circadian clock linked with effects on fish day night behavior.",

The influence of antizymes, both by direct binding and indirectly, on other pathways and the potential role of factors other than polyamines on antizyme frameshifting, is the subject of several reports and of active investigation (291,307,308). The potential for polyamine levels to have specific effects on other cases of frameshifting also needs to be kept in mind especially as a certain combination of the levels of putrescine and spermidine was shown to influence the S. cerevisiae mobile element Ty1 frameshifting and so the rate of its retrotransposition (309). Because of the up-regulation of polyamine synthesis in important disease, much work is being devoted to identifying inhibitors. From a frameshifting perspective, the distinction between the very different situations with S. cerevisiae antizyme and mammalian antizyme 3 and the contrasts between each of them and the other types of antizyme frameshifting, is intriguing even with our current limited knowledge.",

Heterologous expression of several sequences from ORF overlaps demonstrated very high levels of frameshifting (198), and regulatory potential merits investigation, keeping in mind that, though the gene is assigned the name magnesium chelatase, binding of something else, perhaps a different cation, could be relevant.

In several bacteria, but not in others, e.g. E. coli, a separate gene encodes a small soluble copper binding protein (metallochaperone) that transfers copper to its membrane-integral partner.

A key part of the concentrating mechanism is giant organelle-like structures, carboxysomes, of 200+ MDa and 80\u2013500 nm that contain thousands of protomers, and which have some resemblance to icosahedral viral capsids. RuBisCO is sequestered within the protein shell microcompartment. Remarkably just 10 genes from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus are sufficient to express the \u03b1-carboxysome in the heterologous bacterium E. coli (314). One of these genes encodes the cargo proteins carbonic anhydrase and several encode shell proteins. Decoding of one of the genes, csoS2, required for carboxysome formation (315), utilizes 50% efficient \u22121 frameshifting (316). The product of standard decoding, Cso2B, is 869 amino acids and the product of frameshifting, Cso2A has 570 amino acids with its 3 C-terminal amino acids encoded by the \u22121 frame. Unlike Cso2B it cannot function in forming carboxysome. It has been speculated that the function of having two forms of Cso2 is related to partitioning of RuBisCO, Cso2B functioning primarily underneath the shell and Cso2A within the lumen of the carboxysome. But as Cso2B has only just been discovered, characterization will take some time. However, interestingly Cso2 has functional similarities to foot-and-mouth disease virus protein VP4 which binds to the interior side of the viral capsid (316). Currently 162 species are known with cso2 genes and 79 are predicted to utilize frameshifting (316), which is therefore important for the global carbon cycle.",

In many fewer bacteria, the product derived from ribosomal frameshifting seems to be reversed with \u03c4 being derived from frameshifting and the termination codon for \u03b3 being in the zero frame directly after the frameshift site (198). One of these candidates that has potential stimulatory signals similar to E. coli dnaX, is Chlorobium phaeobacteroids (S. Heaphy, J.F.A. and P.V.B., unpublished). Though the expression of Thermus thermophilus dnaX is also not like its E. coli counterpart, its longer product, \u03c4, is encoded in a single ORF as in E. coli. Transcriptional slippage results in a population of mRNAs with extra bases. As there are nearby stop codons in both non-zero frames (with respect to the template DNA), standard translation of those with non-multiples of three extra bases, yields \u03b3, which is again synthesized in a 1:1 ratio to \u03c4 (323). In E. coli, the shift site involved is highly shift-prone (94,320\u2013322) due to the pairing of the sole tRNALys with the second shift-site codon involved being relatively weak (324). However, in Thermus thermophilus there are two lysine tRNAs one for each of the two lysine codons, AAA and AAG. As one of these is expected to tightly pair, and so poorly dissociate from AAG, this may be relevant to T. thermophilus utilization of RNA polymerase slippage rather than the ribosomal frameshifting used to generate its E. coli counterpart.",

            "text": "Many different Gram negative bacteria that interact with plants or animals use a Type III secretion system, or injectosome, to inject proteins into host cells for initial hijacking of their functions. Another ca. 25 proteins including transcription activators, are used to build the secretion system. In Shigella, which causes human dysentery, the encoding genes are plasmid-borne. After transcribing the first 58 codons of spa13, transcriptional slippage yields mRNA that results in 25 to 30% of the product having a C-terminal extension of 112 AA required for secretion system function. The encoding sequence for the end of this extension overlaps the start of spa32 and transcriptional slippage in spa13 has a major effect on spa32 expression (326). Spa32 is very important in the determination of the length of the hollow extracellular needle that forms the injection conduit (327). Spa32's role in length determination is affected by its interaction with Spa40 that also interacts with 5 other proteins including Spa33 and MxiA (328). Expression of spa33 and mxiA also involves transcription slippage but in these cases it yields truncated products (326). In addition, slippage to yield an extended product occurs in the expression of the regulator gene mxiE with substantial effects on the expression of the adjacent downstream gene (329). Whether the modulatory effect of the transcription slippage on the ratio of the products is influenced by environmental conditions is unknown. While this type III secretion system mechanism is different from phage lambda GT ribosomal frameshifting, expression of the Yersinia pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis YopN-TyeA fusion protein related to function of its type III system is also at the ribosomal frameshifting level (330,331). Y. pestis, the etiological agent of the infamous plague, is still a major human problem in several countries (332) and Y. pseudotuberculosis is a less aggressive foodborne enteropathogen. After it is transmitted by fleas to warm-blooded animals and the needle part of the type III secretion system senses contact with a host cell, a signaling system influences five proteins to no longer inhibit secretion of the effector proteins that reorganize the host cell. One of these is YopN. However, while the frameshift product has a distinct impact on fitness, the reason is not understood despite extensive work on the complicated system involved (331). Polyamines are linked to controlling the type III secretion systems (333,334) and the prospect that polyamines could influence the frameshifting event leading to YopN-TyeA hybrid synthesis is considered tantalizing (331).",

            "text": "Many different eukaryotic mRNAs exhibit sub-cellular localization with understanding of its significance being very incomplete and interest in especially the neuron-destined mRNAs being very high. When the yeast S. cerevisiae buds several mRNAs are transported to the daughter cells in an actin dependent, but translationally independent, manner by the myosin machinery. However, the conserved N-terminal 17 amino acids of ABP140 is an actin binding domain (336,337) that co-translationally causes its mRNA to associate with actin cables and be transported to the distant pole of the mother cell, rather than to the daughter cell. Unlike much mRNA transport, this trafficking is independent of mRNA structure (338). Zero frame codons 277\u2013279 have a Ty1-like +1 frameshift site CUU_AGG_C (that involves neither Thr nor Ser tRNAs) and codon 280 is a stop codon. The doubtless substantial proportion of ribosomes diverted to the +1 frame decode a 348-codon ORF that specifies a methyltransferase, a major function of which is in formation of the 3-methylcytidine modification at position 32 of the anticodons of several tRNAThr and tRNASer isoacceptors, hence the TRM140 (tRNA methyltransferase) designation (336,339). [Of unknown significance is that zero-frame codons 208\u2013214 specify (DG)STSTTTS and codons 251\u2013261 specify (DD)TTGDTTSSTTS (340) with the latter being just before a +1 frame stop codon at the end of a 171 codon ORF.] The resulting fusion of structural and enzymatic functions yields an indirect linkage of actin to tRNA modification. tRNA position 32 interacts with position 38 on the other side of the anticodon loop (341) with consequences for decoding accuracy (342). The significance of the frameshifting and presumably of location-specific methyltransferase activity is unknown but likely related to its function in the yeast's natural environment and not in lab culture. [Why deletion strains are sensitive to neomycin is obscure (343).] Nevertheless, given the time of divergence of the ancestors of the yeast species that have the characteristics of ABP140 frameshifting, the frameshifting has to have been occurring for 150 million years and be of selective advantage (242). [However, S. castellii has lost the frameshift site.] ORF1 is much less conserved than ORF2 which is also conserved in other organisms that do not have fused expression with an upstream ORF.",

It was listed as a candidate for utilized frameshifting in its expression (344). APC functions in the canonical Wnt/Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway in Drosophila and mammals (Drosophila APC is implicated in intestinal stem cell proliferation, and in mammals APC mutants are a direct cause of colon cancer). \u22121 frameshifting was experimentally found to occur 143 nts upstream of the computationally predicted switch of coding frame signatures (46). Zero frame conservation only of the segment 5\u2032 of the frameshift site, and of the segment 3\u2032 of the frameshift product termination codon, implies that the part of the product of standard decoding encoded by the intervening zero-frame sequence merely serves as a linker. Significance of the frameshifting is indicated by conservation of the new frame product. Suggestive of an ancient origin of the frameshifting, it also occurs in nematodes, but interestingly, in that case the C-terminal region of the trans-frame product encoded by the \u22121 frame is much shorter (13 AA versus 125 AA) (46). Immunoprecipitation of human APC reveals a variety of shorter than full-length products but whether any of these are frameshift derived is unknown \u2013 and not easy to analyze given the low expression level. However, a single T to A transversion that results in a run of 8 As is relatively prevalent in a specific population group where it is directly associated with colon cancer (345). Both replicational and transcriptional slippage are likely responsible for the causative protein products whose synthesis is prematurely terminated by stop codons that are not in the WT zero frame (345,346).",

Though macrolide antibiotics inhibit bacterial translation, bacteria have developed uORF translational systems for sensing very low levels of their presence and activating initiation of synthesis of a resistance determinant. uORF-mediated regulation of ermC that renders bacteria resistant to erythromycin and other macrolide antibiotics has been particularly well-studied in part because of the clinical importance of macrolides. The most recent generation of macrolides are ketolides, e.g. telithromycin. While some macrolides cause stalling during uORF translation with resulting prevention of sequestration of the ermC initiator, telithromycin instead, in a manner largely independent of nascent peptide sequence, induces a proportion of ribosomes to shift frame. Their continued translation in the new frame into the intergenic spacer unfolds mRNA structure and permits initiation of ermC expression (61). Prior to this discovery, the most promising candidate for productive utilization of frameshifting to influence downstream expression via mRNA unfolding had been pheL, the uORF for the downstream bacterial phenylalanine biosynthesis gene, pheA, (especially Enterobacteria, e.g. E. coli). However, the frameshifting that does occur seems to be a by-product of the features responsible for the transcription attenuation control mechanism utilized and to be incidental (19).",

In Euplotes, UGA is reassigned from being a stop codon, perhaps derived by selection as a defence against invading pathogens including in their food (359). It has been proposed that the accompanying alteration of release factor recognition (360) results in poor decoding of UAA (in the ribosomal A-site) thereby enhancing the opportunity for frameshifting when the P-site tRNA has potential for re-pairing in the +1 frame (361,362). Though this is likely relevant, rampant frameshifting is not known in ciliates other than Euplotes even though they also feature stop codon reassignment (of UAG in some). Intriguing mysteries abound and the discovery that WT release factor can be involved in 4-base stop codon recognition may be relevant (363,364).",

A small proportion of Alzheimer's disease is inherited and due to mutations in the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein. A small proportion of it is encoded transframe with respect to its DNA sequence (366). Further, in both Alzheimer's and Spinocerebellar ataxia 3, after formation of intranuclear aggregates, some ubiquitin B has C-terminal Gly replaced by a Tyr followed by a 19-AA extension encoded trans-frame with respect to the DNA (366,367). This aberrant ubiquitin triggers neuronal apoptosis and mitochondrial impairment that likely contributes to at least Alzheimer's progression (368). Though called UBB+1 in the publications just cited, in the notation generally used, including here, the C-terminal extension comes from the \u22121 frame (369).

With the neurodegenerative diseases spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and Huntington's, where expansion of the trinucleotide CAG in the standard coding sequence is key to the disease, ribosomal frameshifting, at least, occurs (373\u2013376). The polyalanine containing product of \u22121 frameshifting is likely very important medically (377) due to the formation of \u03b1-helical clusters rather than the amyloid-fibrils of polyglutamine (378). Counterpart frameshifting in Kaposi sarcoma and Epstein Barr viruses is considered above. Since a number of other chromosomal genes, including those for several transcription factors, have substantial runs of repeats (379,380), potential relevance elsewhere and perhaps not even incidental, is possible. In addition to, or perhaps in some cases instead of, potential ribosomal frameshifting, there is the possibility of at least G quadruplexes influencing oncoming RNA polymerase to mediate a certain level of transcriptional realignment that could by standard translation yield products with alternative C-terminal regions. Doubtless this will be a topic for future work.",

With an insert giving a poly(A) tract of 28 As the overall total of shifting to the +1 frame with respect to the genomic sequence is 40% (382). Identification of a modifier that has a big effect on the level of frameshifting (383) should be informative. In addition to the long known ribosomal frameshifting on runs of A to an alternative frame, realignment by \u22123 has recently been described to yield a zero-frame product with an extra lysine (384). There is just a single AAA_AAA_AAA sequence in E. coli coding sequence (50-fold less common than extrapolated from the number of AAA codons) [Where ribosomal frameshifting to the +1 frame occurs by shifting either \u22122 or +1 nt, the frameshift product of the former has an extra amino acid compared to the latter. Retrograde realignment (toward the mRNA 5\u2032 end) has also been demonstrated with a cassette with a derivative of the T4 gene 60 bypassing sequence region; in that case, with coding resumption occurring in a different frame so that one ribosome decoded a sequence segment and, following transient peptidyl-tRNA anticodon: codon dissociation, realigned backwards to read the same sequence in a different frame to synthesize a single product (385).]",

Further, hydroxymethylcytosine performs an essential role in Drosophila brain mRNA (388) and there have been numerous studies on N6-methyladenosine in mRNA (389). However, it is unknown if any utilized frameshifting occurs at an mRNA modification site, or is dependent on ribosome heterogeneity. Frame transitions generally involve realignment. Sites at which ribosomal frameshifting occurs exhibit considerable variation in their inherent \u2018shiftiness\u2019. Many studies have shown that one relevant feature for the great majority of 1 or 2 nt ribosomal frameshifting is the balance between propensity for anticodon:codon dissociation and potential for re-pairing to mRNA at an overlapping codon in a new frame with tRNA modifications being relevant (54,324,390\u2013392), as described for one in detail at the end of this section.",

Though noted as occurring at the sequence (G_UU)A_AAG where substitution of a C with the italicized A created a \u22121 shift site at which the frameshifting compensated for a nearby \u22121 frameshift mutation (393), A_AAG frameshifting was first extensively studied (394), and later systematically explored, with synthetic constructs (195). Such \u22121 frameshifting occurs incidentally in Bacillus at A_CGA_AAG to give an extended cytidine deaminase (18) and at G_CGA_AAG is productively utilized by IS1222 to synthesize its transposase (189), and with drug-resistant mutant herpes viruses (6). Studies with it showed that the efficiency of this type of relatively low level \u22121 frameshifting is dependent on the identity of the two flanking 5\u2032 bases. Studies in E. coli of these nucleotides in the sequence NNA_AAG focused on the degree of anticodon loop flexibility and base 34 modification of the tRNAs decoding the 5\u2032 codon (an underscore separates the zero frame codons). Codons whose cognate tRNAs exhibited greater wobble propensity gave higher frameshifting levels probably due to increased liberation of the third codon base, A, for the re-pairing of tRNALys in the \u22121 frame (193). E. coli tRNALys can also promote a single slippage type event with wheat germ ribosomes whereas E. coli tRNAAsn can only promote double-type slippage events at its counterpart codon in both E. coli and wheat germ systems, illustrating the subtleties involved (395). A different type of experiment provided evidence that peptidyl-tRNA re-pairing is not required to give a very low but detectable amount of product (396).",

            "text": "When the hexanucleotide motif is extended to become a heptanucleotide so that the tRNA decoding the 5\u2032 codon of the pair of adjacent codons also has the potential of re-pairing to mRNA in the \u22121 frame, then the frameshifting propensity substantially increases. This was discovered in retroviral frameshifting studies (102). The motif has the form X_XXY_YYZ. While XXX often represents any three identical nucleotides, there are intermediates with the hexanucleotide situation just described; e.g. X_XX is G_GU in phage T7 gene 10 decoded by bacterial ribosomes (397), cardioviruses, e.g. encephalomyocarditis virus (58) and some luteoviruses; G_GA in many insect specific flaviviruses (119,123,124), some umbraviruses and dianthoviruses and in mesoniviruses (398); G_UU(A) in equine arteritis virus (104,134); C_CA(A) in IS3 (399) and U_CC in some members of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses (70,124). Initial studies in the contexts of retroviral frameshifting and coronaviral frameshifting showed that among the most shifty \u22121 heptanucleotide sequences with mammalian cytoplasmic ribosomes are A_AAA_AAC, G_GGA_AAC, U_UUA_AAC and G_GGU_UUU (62,104). Following on from the shiftiness described in the last paragraph for A_AAG in E. coli, further work with synthetic constructs, also in E. coli showed that A_AAA_AAG is much more shift-prone than A_AAA_AAC, A_AAA_AAA, U_UUU_UUA or U_UUU_UUU (94). Shortly afterward A_AAA_AAG was found to be the naturally utilized shift site for E. coli dnaX frameshifting (320\u2013322). Approximately half of known bacteria including E. coli, have just one lysine tRNA for decoding both AAA and AAG. Its wobble position, base 34, S, which pairs with the third codon base, is U hypermodified with 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine. While the conserved base 3\u2032 adjacent to the anticodon, N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), is critical for recognition of codons with first position A, it is the modification of U34 which is important for discrimination against asparagine codons, AAC and AAU, and also AUA, (400) and refs therein. NMR studies showed that these two modifications remodel an otherwise dynamic loop (401). X-ray crystallographic studies with 70S ribosomes and long mRNA revealed a novel type of base-pairing interaction with third codon base G that broadens known wobble position geometries. In it the modified U is moved toward the minor groove in contrast to standard Crick-proposed wobble geometry in which the pyrimidine is displaced toward the major groove of the codon:anticodon minihelix (400). This work highlights the role of the larger subunit, in E. coli ribosomes helix 69, for positioning and stabilization of the anticodon loop (helix 69 forms intersubunit bridge B2a relevant to regulation of groove monitor A1492 (402)). Further, the work is regarded as important evidence for their proposition that steric complementarity is predominant over the number of hydrogen bonds for third base discrimination (400). As the degree of stability of third codon position pairing is highly relevant to the codon:anticodon dissociation central to at least most frameshifting, several earlier discussions about frameshift sites and in particular the less restrictive third codon position, were likely overly focused on hydrogen bonding.",

The greatest departure from the notion of simultaneous \u22121 shifting is that just peptidyl-tRNA is involved in the slippage process with the incoming aminoacyl tRNA having the opportunity to also pair in the \u22121 frame. Experimental evidence for this has been obtained with a variant of the E. coli dnaX \u22121 shift cassette (403). However, discussion of the relationship of that study to other recent biophysical studies and their combined implication are delayed until after the description of stimulators below, since they are key to the non-canonical ribosome states critical for understanding what happens at the shift site.",

            "text": "Depending on the realignment possibilities present, ribosomal frameshifting can be prone to occur when the A-site codon is slow-to-decode, due to limitation of the relevant aminoacyl-tRNA. Arising from his group's studies of amino acid starvation on single-nucleotide frameshifting (407\u2013409), Jon Gallant referred to such codons as \u2018hungry\u2019 codons. A slow-to-decode A-site is more generally important for +1 frameshifting than it is for \u22121 frameshifting. A very interesting occurrence involves the expression of Ty elements in S. cerevisiae and related yeasts. The Ty1 shift site, CUU_AGG_C on its own mediates a remarkable 40% +1 frameshifting. The S. cerevisiae shift site for ABP140 is identical and that for EST3 (CUU_AGU_U) is similar. The anticodon of the tRNALeu that decodes CUU in the Ty1 shift site is 3\u2032GAU5\u2032 which has its wobble base 34, U, unmodified. This allows the tRNA in vivo to read all 4 CUN codons including CUU (410). Where U:U apposition is involved, it is akin to the 2-out-of-3 reading identified elsewhere (411,412). Poor zero-frame codon pairing by peptidyl-tRNALeu facilitates dissociation permitting re-pairing to mRNA at the overlapping +1 frame UUA. Slow recognition of A-site AGG by low abundance cognate tRNAArg (anticodon 3\u2032UCC5\u2032) facilitates the frameshifting (209,210). The high abundance of tRNAGly (anticodon 3\u2032CCI5\u2032) (413) cognate for the overlapping Ty1 +1 frame codon, GGC, is also important for efficient frameshifting. The implied competition for A-site decoding is mechanistically informative (414).",

While inosine pairs strongly with U and C, its apposition with A allows weaker decoding (416,417) and its purine:purine apposition with G is surely relevant to the frameshifting. Discussion of potential relevance of I pairing through its Watson\u2013Crick side with the Hoogsteen face of A with the A base in the syn conformation with respect to the ribose, and counterpart I:G pairing (418) has been revived (387,419) and may be pertinent.

One interpretation is that slippage is not involved but there is some level of occlusion of the 3\u2032 base, A, facilitating incoming aminoacyl-tRNA pairing with GUU rather than AGU (214,414). Alternatively, there may be peptidyl-tRNA dissociation but not re-pairing to mRNA following slippage (420). [The different 3\u2032 stimulators for Ty3 and EST3, see below, can act largely indiscriminately on Ty1 and Ty3 shift sites (241,421).] Regardless, it is clear that Ty3 frameshifting yields Ala Val (422). Surprisingly S. cerevisiae antizyme frameshifting (shift site GCG_UGA_C (273)) also shows +1 frameshifting even though there is \u20132 re-pairing potential (423). In Kluyveromyces waltii yeast, which unlike S. cerevisiae does have tRNAAla (anticodon CGC), the shift site is CCG_UGA_C. However, it lacks a corresponding tRNAPro (anticodon 3\u2032GGC5\u2032) (423). Despite S. cerevisiae Ty3 and antizyme shift sites both having GCG, when both are tested in the same reporter system, and extrapolated from measurements in the absence of Ty or antizyme context effects, the intrinsic shiftiness of GCG_UGA_C (antizyme) is 37% and GCG_AGU_U (Ty3) is 2%, showing the greater effectiveness of the stop codon (214,414). [For comparison the shiftiness of CUU_AGG_C (Ty1 and ABP140) is 43%.] Correspondingly, as considered below, in its natural yeast context antizyme has inhibitory modulators while Ty3 has a stimulatory modulator.",

            "text": "Limitation of a specific aminoacyl-tRNA can also occur in certain triplet repeat expansion situations. With disease level expansion of CAG repeats in huntingtin, frameshifting at multiple sites has been demonstrated, but in this case it is difficult to distinguish the relative effects of aminoacyl tRNA limitation from a stimulatory effect of a 3\u2032 structure formed from the repeat sequence (376). This study importantly illustrates significance of relative expression levels of a relevant tRNA in different brain tissues. An independent study showed that mutation in a brain-specific tRNA causes neurodegeneration (428). A subset of aminoacyl-tRNAs are tightly associated with translating ribosomes (429,430). To what, if any, extent this is relevant to CAG repeat, and other, frameshifting, is unknown. The issue is to what extent localized aminoacylation limitation for a ribosome translating, for instance a run of repeat codons, is a reflection of overall cellular limitation for that aminoacyl tRNA. In addition to extreme situations, such as when silk fibroin is being synthesized in silk glands, the pool of aminoacyl tRNA isoacceptors changes when different classes of mammalian mRNAs are being translated (431). However, for the only virus tested where frameshift utilization is known, influenza A virus, it is the particular relevant local pool of isoacceptors that is selected rather than the tRNAs overall being adjusted (432). Though some viruses encode their own tRNAs, whether any are relevant to frameshifting is unknown.",

The effect of this on frameshifting has been studied extensively in E. coli (409). What is unclear is under natural conditions, the extent to which such \u2018hungry codon\u2019 frameshifting leads to out-of-frame termination with subsequent proteolysis contributing to recycling of scarce amino acids for the synthesis of proteins that are vital under such conditions.

            "text": "Almost all tRNAs have standard anticodon loop sizes. Among the few exceptions are a mitochondrial tRNA from yeast S. cerevisiae (434), tRNAs in a phage (435) that has many relatives, (436) and a mitochondrial tRNA from the glass sponge Iphiteon panacea (252). The S. cerevisiae tRNA has an extra base in its anticodon loop but neither it nor the other two, are known to mediate frameshifting. However, frameshifting does occur naturally in expression of several mitochondrial genes in Polyrhachis species and I. panacea. One of the I. panacea mitochondrial tRNAs whose anticodon loop very likely has 9 nts is tRNAGly and it has 4 bases in the anticodon location that matches the UGGA codon at which the shift to the +1 frame occurs. The frameshifting properties of mutant tRNAs with 9 or 10 nt anticodon loops has been studied in E. coli with spontaneously arising mutants (437) or ones sought in code expansion studies (438); though enlarged anticodon loops do not necessarily imply other than triplet pairing inside WT ribosomes (439,440), the use of the anticodon loop of a tRNA switching stacking to present an alternative offset triplet anticodon has been proposed (441). However, even if quadruplet pairing or an anticodon loop \u2018roll\u2019 occurred in a few cases of mitochondrial frameshifting, it would be exceptional and not the general explanation. Nevertheless, while much of the natural frameshifting in mitochondrial expression to circumvent potential deleterious consequences of mutational inserts follows the same principles as just described, some of the features are mitochondrial specific. At most of the insert sites in Polyrhachis ants, the zero-frame codon 3\u2032 adjacent to that for the peptidyl-tRNAGly involved in the switch are AGY codons. Its cognate tRNA has a characteristic restricted to a subset of mitochondrial tRNAs in that it lacks the DHU stem, and has a distinctive structure. Perhaps it is slow-to-decode. The +1 frameshifting in decoding several genes in glass sponges occurs at extremely rare UGG_(A), or CGG_(A) codons (with all the inserts being T, or rarely C, 5\u2032 adjacent to a GGA codon). Though most of their frameshifting has been similarly interpreted to that of Ty3 (252), other possibilities merit consideration (mitochondrial ribosomes also have an E-site, despite an earlier proposal to the contrary, and so dissociation potential of the corresponding codon: anticodon interaction may be relevant).",

Utilization for searches of cellular gene utilized frameshifting is also possible (125). Mutating the UCC codon to AGC (serine) or to GGG, CCC or AAA resulted in a 40 to 70% reduction in the frameshifting efficiency (39), giving credence to the possibility that UCC plays an important positive role in the E-site or at least 5\u2032 of the codon to which peptidyl-tRNA is paired at commencement of the shift (125). Though it is somewhat of a \u2018special\u2019 case because of the nature of its stimulatory element (see below), prior work on E. coli release factor 2 frameshifting lead to the proposal that weaker \u2018E-site\u2019 pairing disturbance favored higher +1 frameshifting levels (443\u2013446). However, though likely different for \u22121 frameshifting, E-site relevance was also demonstrated for HIV (405,447,448), pea enation mosaic virus (406) and other cases of frameshifting. Additionally, in yeast, bioinformatic evidence suggests that when X_XXY_YYZ is in the P and A ribosomal sites, the identity of the two nucleotides immediately upstream in the E site are highly biased, suggesting an extended signal (449). Fluorescence and FRET studies either involving single ribosomes or ensemble approaches with the stopped-flow technique showed that E-site dissociation is delayed on ribosomes stalled by the E. coli dnaX-, or a coronaviral, 3\u2032 \u22121 frameshift stimulatory element (403,450). Nevertheless, single molecule studies with zero-mode waveguide tracking of ribosomes show that the E-site tRNA is released before the ribosome rotates backward, both with E. coli dnaX \u22121 frameshifting and especially with T4 gene 60 bypassing (403,451).",

Non-cognate \u22121 frameshifting was shown in an early in vitro study that revealed frameshifting significance of the balance of tRNA. With an unperturbed balance of tRNAs, an ACC decoding tRNAThr was shown to read a CCN proline codon to generate an elongated form of phage MS2 synthetase (73,75) (Figure 9). The identity of just 4 anticodon loop bases is important for this frameshifting (452), but distinction between two alternative mechanisms remains unresolved (453) and whether there is relevance for other cases of frameshifting remains to be seen. [The only other tRNA found in that study to mediate non-cognate frameshifting was a tRNASer and it is these two tRNAs that decode \u03a8AG codons (387,454).] The best known case of a different type of extreme recoding involving mRNA sliding, is in decoding phage T4 gene 60. Peptidyl-tRNA dissociates from codon 46, GGA and re-pairs to mRNA 47 nts 3\u2032 at GGA with coding resuming at the 3\u2032 adjacent UUA, codon 47. This and other cases involving stimulators are considered below. However, sliding on runs of A has recently been reported (384,455).",

The highly conserved shift site is CUU_U, even though re-pairing to mRNA in the +1 frame involves first position G:U pairing. Other shift sites have doubtless been sampled repeatedly over the course of evolution, and UUU_U does occur in a small minority of species. Significantly, in the release factor 2 genes that do not utilize frameshifting in their expression, the first position of the codon corresponding to the CUU is not conserved (443). The most extensive substitution analysis of the CUU shift site, 32 variants, was performed with the 3\u2032 adjacent codon being UAG rather than UGA (390), though the values for the 6 substitutions that are the same as those used in an earlier smaller study with UGA (54), are consistent. CUU_U was found to be by far the most efficient shift site raising the possibility that the simple, m1G, modification of the anticodon base 3\u2032 adjacent to that in the cognate tRNALeu that pairs with the first codon base C, is important for the much higher levels than with UUU_U where the counterpart base 37 of the cognate tRNA has the bulky adduct threonine in carbamoyl linkage to the 6-amino group of A37 (390). While elaborate modification of base 37 of tRNAPhe helps restrain first position wobble in standard decoding, and first position wobble would not be relevant with a UUU_U shift site, nevertheless its presence may be inhibitory for frameshifting. Several studies, including (354), have shown that the identity of the base 3\u2032 adjacent to the ORF1 stop codon UGA is also very important, and a C at this position is highly conserved.",

In E. coli K12, not only is peptidyl-tRNAPro relevant to the level of frameshifting, the identity of the penultimate amino acid, phenylalaine, is significant and that of the amino acid encoded 10 codons 5\u2032 is also relevant. So specific amino acid effects occur not just at the time of polymerization but well within the ribosome peptide exit tunnel. The frameshifting in this case appears an incidental accompaniment of features important for transcription attenuation. Still it is interesting that when tested in E. coli K12, the nascent peptide signal utilized to promote the efficient bypassing of 50 nucleotides in decoding phage T4 gene 60 (considered below) stimulated 60% +1 frameshifting at the CCC_UGA (19).

            "text": "Antizyme mRNAs with the CCC_UGA shift site have naturally emerged in evolution but are in a tiny minority as only two were known at the time of an extensive survey (270,293). For the substantial majority of antizyme genes the +1 shift site is UCC_UGA. When CCC_UGA was tested in place of UCC_UGA in a specific cassette in mammalian cells, significantly reduced frameshifting was monitored (465). Of greater interest is nascent peptide relevance. As just discussed, the S. cerevisiae antizyme shift site GCG_UGA_C, is anomalously shift-prone. When accompanied by its flanking sequence the frameshifting level of 65% has been measured (268). In contrast to organisms other than budding yeast, dynamic regulation is achieved by controlled reduction of the frameshifting level instead of controlled enhancement. As the discoveries on S. cerevisiae antizyme regulation by Dohmen and colleagues (268) are not only intriguing in their own right, their implications for the mechanism in other organisms make it desirable to consider first (Figure 10). At low polyamine levels inactivation of the frameshift inhibitory signals leads to a 20-fold increase in antizyme synthesis. A crucial inhibitory component is a nascent peptide encoded near the end of the coding sequence and only synthesized by a ribosome that frameshifted 669 nts (223 codons) upstream. At low polyamine levels, this nascent peptide interacts with the ribosome peptide exit tunnel to stall the ribosome. This blocks progression of following ribosomes and so of antizyme synthesis. However, at high levels polyamines bind to the nascent peptide precluding it from causing a stall. For the leading ribosome to stall at low polyamine levels, there has to be adequate distance from the following ribosome and the frameshifting provides a partial \u2018choke\u2019 to decrease ribosome density and increase the spacing. [An additional more mysterious larger structural element specified upstream of this inhibitory signal but downstream of the frameshift site is also relevant.] A second inhibitory element is also a nascent peptide sequence, but it is encoded so far upstream of the frameshift site that it is expected to be well outside the ribosome at the time of its modulatory action. Changing the Ile encoded by codon 5 to Phe had a major effect and inactivation of the signal resulted in frameshifting efficiency increasing to 62%. Though it acts independently of the distal element, it has been proposed to facilitate the frameshifting pausing involved in adjusting downstream ribosome number for the distal sensor (268). How it acts is unknown.",

One aspect of its relevance to the non-budding yeast cases considered next is that polyamine binding assays done in parallel with S. cerevisiae antizyme shows that human antizyme 1 also directly binds polyamines. So even where the intrinsic level of frameshifting is much lower and stimulators rather than inhibitors are used, direct binding of polyamines to nascent peptide has the potential to be generally important for the regulatory aspect.",

            "text": "So far the only evidence for this comes from a study of antizyme +1 frameshifting in the Agaricomycotina class of Basidiomycota fungi. A nascent peptide encoded between codons 14 and 4 5\u2032 of the shift site, UUU, is highly conserved at the protein identity specific level (270,466). It is an important stimulator and serves a polyamine-sensing role for modulating antizyme frameshifting levels and so for the autoregulatory circuit (466). It is perhaps even likely that part of the mRNA encoding this nascent peptide signal also functions as a recoding signal at the mRNA level in the mRNA exit channel and while it appears that the identity of the nts immediately 5\u2032 of the shift site are important at the mRNA level, effects at the amino acid level may in addition be relevant (466). The Agaricomycetes are the only examples so far where bioinformatic analysis has pointed to a nascent peptide stimulator. However, we consider it likely that rather than Agaricomycetes being exceptional in that respect they may instead be exceptional in having reduced, or no, importance for the nucleotide sequence encoding a nascent peptide stimulator also having an important stimulatory role at the level of mRNA in the ribosomal mRNA channel. In this hypothesis, the counterpart nascent peptide sequence is also important in higher eukaryotes, but it is not apparent bioinformatically due to lack of third codon position variation because of the stimulatory action at the mRNA level also. Despite no pause being evident just 5\u2032 of the shift site at the end of ORF1 in ribosome profiling experiments, perhaps because of sensitivity reasons, the hypothesis raises the issue whether prolines and glycines are encoded in a relevant position upstream of the antizyme frameshift site. Some interchangeability between the imino acid proline which is very different from glycine could be informative in relation to the distinction between potential nascent peptide decoding effects and those due to either product function outside the ribosome or nucleotide sequence effects during decoding.",

            "text": "Excluding the special case of antizyme 3, there is frequent occurrence of either a glycine or proline, as in human antizyme 1, encoded 7 codons 5\u2032 of the shift site and flanked on one or other side by a proline or glycine (Table 2). The location of the proline in human antizyme 1 in a complex of antizyme and some of its interacting partners is now known (276,291). Because antizyme has other interacting partners, caution is needed about function in intact protein except to note that proline would be very different from glycine. However, though context dependent (see below) tandem proline or proline glycine (see below) can be slow-to-decode. Proline is an exceptionally poor donor and acceptor for peptide bond formation for steric rather than electronic reasons (467). Polyproline containing peptidyl-tRNA is prone to destabilization leading to drop-off (467), and the ribosomes are trapped in a pre-translocational state with a free E-site (468). In eukaryotes this is recognized by a protein with a tRNA-like shape, elongation factors eEF5 (formerly eIF5A), that aids polymerization, Reviews (469,470). Distinct from the type of association between polyamines and antizyme, in eEF5 a key lysine residue is uniquely post-translationally modified with polyamine-derived hypusine. Hypusine, and different modifications on the bacterial counterpart of eEF5, EF-P, likely evolved for the stabilization of the CCA-end of P-site tRNA (470,471) [Importance of CCA characteristics are shown by tRNA with CCA mutated to GCA or ACA causing frameshifting at a specific sequence and this being enhanced by mutants of hrpA (440,472) that encodes an RNA helicase (473). EF-P is also relevant to frame maintenance (474).] eEF5's hypusine moiety interacts with the backbone of the CCA-end of the P-site tRNA and entropically steers the substrate into a more favorable position in the peptidyl-transfer center (467,468,475). Reduced hypusination of eEF5 due to limiting polyamines, would likely lead to a greater stall presumably with increased drop-off (whether the third codon base in the key codons preferentially has non C or G in the third codon base to facilitate such hypothetical regulatory drop-off has not been addressed). Irrespective, perhaps reduced hypusination can influence the nascent peptide already in the peptide tunnel or some other feature of the ribosome that has an effect on frameshifting 6 codons later. Studies in bacteria have shown that the extent of stalling at proline codon stall sites is strongly influenced by the identity of the amino acids specified 5\u2032 up to a distance of 3 to 5 codons, though the effect decreases with distance. Though the pattern is complex depending on the identity of the stall site, codons for H, K, Q, R or W enhance stalling in contrast to those for C, G, L, S or T (476,477) (Note in the StopGo mechanism, below, the flanking amino acid on the N-terminal side is N, and UGG encoding W is strongly conserved as the second codon 5\u2032 of the antizyme shift site). Features of the nascent peptide just inside the peptide exit tunnel are likely relevant. The identity of the codon directly 3\u2032 and the extent of spacing between ribosomes can also be relevant (476,478). [A progressive effect over several codons of the gene 60 bypassing nascent peptide signal is described 2 paragaraphs down.]",

Nevertheless, in the absence of a nascent peptide modulator and independent of mRNA:rRNA interaction stimulation, increasing polyamine levels, such as occur at the early logarithmic phase of growth, enhance release factor 2 frameshifting (481). While polyamines preferentially enhance the levels of quite a number of proteins whose synthesis does not involve frameshifting (481,482), this does not detract from significance of their stimulation of a subset of frameshifting, e.g. E. coli dnaX \u22121 frameshifting is not stimulated by polyamines (481). Ty1 +1 frameshifting can also be stimulated but it requires both elevated putrescine and greatly diminished spermidine (309). Considerations derived from these analyses are relevant to the point mentioned above about potential involvement of polyamines in type III secretion system frameshifting involving YopN-TyeA hybrid synthesis (331).",

The nascent peptide recoding signal causes progressively slower translation of the last five codons before the site in gene 60 mRNA of codon:anticodon dissociation. The bypassing step takes 10 to 20 times longer than a standard cycle step, and after coding resumption in the new frame, step times take several cycles to return to normal. The initial progressive slowing is very important for ribosomes assuming the non-canonical rotated state that is central to bypassing (451). Such progressive slowing is distinct from the prior prevailing thought that pausing sites in general would be single discreet sites. Unlike its secM counterpart the most important part of the gene 60 nascent peptide signal, KKYK, is 25 amino acids from the P-site when its effects on translational slowing starts to become apparent and 30 amino acids from the P-site at the time of codon:anticodon dissociation (451). Consistent with the number of amino acids from a key part of the nascent peptide signal to the P-site being important, while retaining the 14 gene 60 codons closest 5\u2032 to the codon: anticodon site, replacing the further 5\u2032 codons with secM sequence natively just 5\u2032 of their pause site, still resulted in significant bypassing (451). However, some charge features of amino acids close to the P-site at the time of dissociation are also relevant (A. Coakley, N. Wills, P. O'Connor, G.L., J. Weissman, P.V.B. and J.F.A. in prep). At the time of nascent peptide mediated peptidyl-tRNA codon: anticodon dissociation there is a stop codon in the ribosomal A-site. Another stimulator of gene 60 bypassing is described next.",

Later, together with its flanking sequence, it forms a functionally important stem loop, designated \u2018take-off stem loop\u2019 (160,385) (Figure 11). Part of the sequence involved is 5\u2032 of the take-off site. The time, or times, at which formation of the take-off stem loop is important remains to be determined \u2013 it has recently been discussed in detail (451). Sequence 5\u2032 of that which becomes involved in the \u2018take-off\u2019 stem can form an independent stem loop, designated 5\u2019 stem loop (485). Evidence is accumulating that by the time the take-off codon has reached the ribosomal P-site, the \u2018top\u2019 5 bp of that stem have already paired just outside the ribosomal mRNA exit channel. The current model is that after liberation of the mRNA on P-site codon: anticodon dissociation, completion of pairing with 4 additional base pairs in the 5\u2032 stem loop serves as a \u2018motor\u2019 by pulling mRNA 5\u2032 to start bypassing movement (451,485) (A.

            "text": "While the role of the Shine Dalgarno sequence in this case is relatively unimportant, internal Shine Dalgarno-like sequences are of major importance for bacterial single nucleotide frameshifting both \u22121 and +1. The number of nucleotides between frameshift stimulatory Shine Dalgarno sequences and the shift site at which it exerts its effect, depends on the directionality of the shift. For +1 frameshifting, it is 3 nts (54,490) and for \u22121 frameshifting it is 9\u201314 nts (491). It was known since 1975 (492), that 30S ribosomal subunit recognition of Shine Dalgano sequences to position initiation was due to pairing of a sequnce near the 3\u2032 end of 16S rRNA. However, it was not suspected that this \u2018anti-Shine Dalgarno\u2019 sequence in translating 70S ribosomes scanned mRNA being decoding for potential complementarity. The finding of Shine Dalgarno-like stimulators for frameshifting showed that such scanning must occur (54,493). [It has also been recently shown for threading-mediated 70S-scanning initiation (494), and is also likely important for translational coupling where the Shine Dalgarno sequence for initiation of a 3\u2032 adjacent gene is before the terminator of the 5\u2032 gene.] The \u22121 frameshifting assays led to the deduction that, after formation, the hybrid stays intact as the ribosome translates 5\u20137 nts and only then does it rupture (491). Consistent with this, and the need for the anti-Shine Dalgano to be available to pair with its frameshift stimulatory complement and not be sequestered by pairing to a 5\u2032 counterpart, the sequence directly 5\u2032 of the stimulatory Shine Dalgarno lacks potential competitor Shine Dalgarno sequences (394) (Figure 12). Direct supportive evidence for hybrid maintenance for several translation cycles comes from the extended number of nucleotides protected from ribonuclease digestion, at internal Shine Dalgarno containing sites revealed by a ribosome profiling/footprinting study (495).",

This has been explored systematically in E. coli (192) with attention being paid to stacking potential of spacer nucleotides. That study used an A_AAA_AAG shift site. Independent of utilization for frameshifting, AAA is used \u223c3 times more commonly than AAG except when the 3\u2032 adjacent base is C when AAG is preferred (507). However, in the frameshifting study though 3\u2032 adjacent CC was the most shift-prone of the dincleotides, 3\u2032 C was in general more shift-prone than U (192). Spacer nucleotide effects has also been studied with a variety of cassettes to a lesser extent in eukaryotes (104,508) where in some cases an initially unrecognized \u2018lower\u2019 part of an identified structure, was thought to be \u2018spacer\u2019 nts, and, as just described, potential to interact directly with ribosomal components is a comparable issue.",

Associated with this has been an under-appreciation of the variety of spacer lengths. As discussed in other sections these range from 3 nts for mammalian antizymes 1 and 2 +1 frameshifting to the 11\u201314 nts for arterivirus \u22122 and cardiovirus frameshifting.

Other recent HIV experiments are also relevant (135,510). Despite this case nearly all 3\u2032 recoding stimulators known are specified wholly 3\u2032 of the shift site, even though in a few cases their extreme proximity to the shift site, just 3 nts for mammalian antizyme 1 +1 frameshifting, would require at least unwinding of the \u2018lower\u2019 part of the structure before the shift site is in the ribosomal P-/A- sites. Whether the important feature is a \u2018set up\u2019 for the remaining part of the structure or an alternative considered in the nascent peptide section above, is unknown. Irrespective of whether the antizyme pseudoknot stimulates the shift directly or indirectly, the extent of conservation of its constituent stems, but not its unpaired components, illustrates the value of what can be termed \u2018phylogenetic probing\u2019 for structure function inferences (270) (Figure 14). The diversity of modulators 5\u2032 of the shift site is at least matched by that of 3\u2032 stimulators. As mentioned, the majority of intra-mRNA 3\u2032 stimulatory signals, have their 5\u2032 ends 6\u20139 nts 3\u2032 of the shift site and are thought to be at the mRNA unwinding site within the mRNA entrance tunnel (511,512) when the shift site is in the P-/A- sites. Expression in heterologous systems (513,514) and in homologous systems (98,406,515), have revealed differences between bacteria and eukaryotic systems in optimal spacer lengths or within eukaryotes for specific 3\u2032 stimulators, in one case with implications for frameshift directionality. For a minority of 3\u2032 stimulators their 5\u2032 ends are 12\u201315 nts 3\u2032 of the shift site and are likely to have their influence at the outer edge of the mRNA entrance channel. These stimulators can involve either intra-mRNA structure or \u2018linear\u2019 mRNA with the characterized ones being associated with trans-acting factors (23,58,59).",

The type of 3\u2032 structures range from simple stem loops, as with E. coli dnaX \u22121 frameshifting (392,403,517,518), likely plant sobemoviruses (463,519\u2013521) and explored systematically with the simian retrovirus shift site (522), to more elaborate stem loop structures such as in bacterial IS911 (188) and HIV (509,510) to compact pseudoknots as in poleroviruses, e.g. beet western yellows virus (Figure 13B), potato leaf roll virus and sugarcane yellow leaf virus (523,524), larger pseudoknots with all components specified nearby (see below), to pseudoknots in which a lateral bulge-loop of an extended stem-loop structure 3\u2032-adjacent to the frameshift site interacts with an apical loop of a distant stem-loop structure (ALIL) (45,110,525). A subset of related sequences can use either stem loop or pseudoknot stimulators, for instance among IS elements (187), different alphaviruses (140), and probably different flaviviruses (70,120,123,124). The great majority of the frameshift stimulatory pseudoknots studied are for \u22121 frameshifting, but some are known for +1 frameshifting. Multiple features of 3\u2032 intra-mRNA structural stimulators may influence frameshifting including thermodynamic stability, stem and loop lengths, torsional resistance, susceptibility or not to a protonated dependent switch and specific three-dimensional structures.",

The great majority are H (hairpin)-type pseudoknots meaning that a sequence of nucleotides within a hairpin loop base-pairs with a complementary region external to the hairpin. All H-type pseudoknots contain two helical stems, S1 and S2, and two non-equivalent loops, L1 and L2. Some also contain a third loop, L3. The IBV frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot features a long stem 1 which cannot be functionally reduced to less than 11 base pairs, significantly equivalent to one turn of an RNA A-form helix (106), and other pseudoknots such as those in the alphavirus, western equine encephalitis virus also have long stems (140). In contrast, the MMTV gag-pro frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot (529), features an unpaired intercalated \u2018wedge\u2019 adenosine between two short stems of similar length (Figure 13D). This frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot was the first to be characterized by NMR (530). Thermodynamic and structural insights into the role divalent metal ions play in stabilizing the structure followed (531,532). The intercalated, or \u2018wedge\u2019 A gives a bent, \u2018kinked\u2019, structure that is important for function (533,534), though it contributes only modestly to stability (532). A wedge A base is also present in several other frameshift stimulatory pseudoknots (85,86,227) including the related simian retrovirus-1 gag-pro pseudoknot (535,536) where, despite the wedge A, NMR analysis highlighted the importance of stem coaxial stacking and loop L2-stem S1 interactions (537). Other studies focused on the importance of the triple helical feature and several interactions (538,539).",

The efficiency of the infectious bronchitis virus pseudoknot with its long stem 1, is unrelated to the thermodynamic stability (106) or its mechanical unwinding properties (541). The first cryoEM studies of ribosomal response to a frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot utilized the avian infectious bronchitis virus pseudoknot and revealed distorted tRNAs in two different A/P hybrid states (108,542). The more recent major improvements in cryoEM sensitivity means that invaluable insights will be forthcoming.",

Initially found for human coronavirus 229E (109), it is also utilized by viruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (543). The pairing involves apical loops, and counterpart pairing involving an internal loop on one or other of the stems is described in the next paragraph. In contrast, the pseudoknot of the coronavirus that mediates SARS disease is an H-type pseudoknot, like that of infectious bronchitis virus. However, that of SARS virus differs in having part of its counterpart of loop 3 folded into a stem loop (543\u2013546). This is involved in intermolecular kissing loop: loop pairing that functions in viral genomic RNA dimerization that in turn affects frameshift efficiency with likely regulatory consequences (547). A pseudoknot stem 3 is also known to be significant for Rous sarcoma virus gag-pol frameshifting (548,549). An additional sub-structure between the main stem loops known as an \u2018Interstem Element\u2019 was characterized in the Visna\u2013Maedi retrovirus frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot where it unusually comprises a 7-nt loop between the two stems and is essential for frameshifting promotion (550). This pseudoknot features a long loop 1 (550). By extrapolation an interstem element of 3 nts also occurs in the pseudoknot of the 1a/1b frameshift stimulator of the arterivirus lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (550,551).",

A similar arrangement, involving what is termed an ALIL pseudoknot, was also predicted for viruses in two Tombusviridae genera, Dianthovirus and Umbravirus (406,463). This was experimentally demonstrated for a member of each, red clover necrotic mosaic virus (554) and the RNA 2 (406) of pea enation mosaic virus (whose taxonomically unrelated RNA 1 is dealt with below). For RNA 2, the long-distance interaction modifies the lower stem of the stimulatory structure close 3\u2032 to the shift site, perhaps by strengthening its stability. However, the same study left open possible relevance of the interaction bringing close other sequence near the 3\u2032 end (406). It is unknown if it is relevant that RNA 2, like the RNAs of many positive-strand RNA viruses, lacks a 5\u2032 cap structure and its cap-independent translation features a sequence in the 3\u2032UTR binding eIF4E and so recruiting eIF4F to mediate initiation via a long distance interaction (555). (In barley yellow dwarf virus, the distal apical loop involved in long distance pairing to the frameshift stimulatory structure just 3\u2032 of the shift site is about 200 nts 3\u2032 of the element that permits cap-independent initiation.) Regardless, quite different considerations apply for the structure involved in bacterial IS3411 ribosomal frameshifting, and at least 27 other IS elements (45). The counterpart involves pairing of the apical loop of a similarly positioned stem 1 with an internal loop of a stem loop 2 that is positioned in the range of 44 to 104 nts 3\u2032 depending on the IS element (45). Remarkably the second component can, to some extent, act in trans (45). With only two variant types currently known, others remain to be found. In addition, some unrelated long range effects remain to be explained including for phage T7 gene 10 frameshifting, where a CCCC sequence in the transcription terminator over 200 nts 3\u2032 of the shift site is involved (397).",

In addition to species of the genera Luteovirus and Polerovirus, the Luteoviridae family of viruses also contains the genus Enamovirus of which RNA-1 of pea enation mosaic virus is a member. The frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot of this RNA-1 has remarkable features including extensive triple-strandedness (559,560). The sugarcane yellow leaf virus frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot, which is similar to its beet western yellows virus counterpart, also has compact features that involve extensive non-Watson\u2013Crick pairing and a base quadruple. It has an extended triplex between the minor groove of stem 1 and loop 3 involving interactions that have features in common with A-minor interactions (523,561). In this class of pseudoknots, the lowest energy \u2018ground state\u2019 does not correlate with frameshifting efficiency, but rather an enhancing of certain reduced stability (463,560). It exhibits pH-dependent, frameshift activity (523), that by analogy to the structural switch revealed by an NMR study of the pseudoknot stimulator of Moloney murine leukemia virus gag readthrough, is very likely due to a protonation dependent switch that induces the active frameshift stimulator (562).",

Distinct from the techniques employed in its analysis, optical trapping has been used to reveal a dynamic ensemble of conformations of the mRNA encoding CCR5, a coreceptor for HIV-1, but their relevance to frameshifting requires further work (563). However, it joins optical tweezers and others in the arsenal of techniques available. In contrast to several earlier proposals, optical tweezers experiments have strongly pointed to conformational dynamics (plasticity) being of prime relevance to frameshifting efficiency rather than the degree of pseudoknot resistance to mechanical unfolding (564). Consistent with this, not all stable pseudoknots stimulate frameshifting and both structural (88,565,566) and mutational analysis of those that do, and do not, promote frameshifting has been insightful. There are many analyses of both categories but one of the mutational analyses is of the compact stimulatory pseudoknots of beet western yellows virus and potato leafroll virus where evidence has been obtained for certain bases being functionally significant but lacking substantial stability effects (567). Studies with two pseudoknot stimulators show that frameshift efficiency is sensitive to the reading phase in which the translating ribosome encounters the pseudoknot but is not simply correlated with the extent of the associated translational pause (107).",

Instead it was suggested that within the ribosome's mRNA entrance channel, it may act by pairing to rRNA (140). The sequence between the shift site and the 3\u2032 pseudoknot frameshift stimulator in Middelburg virus, that in other circumstances would be called a spacer, is similar to that of Semliki Forest virus.

This stall is thought to block the transit of following ribosomes with a trail-back effect on frameshifting. However, at high polyamine levels, the polyamines are proposed to interact with the downstream-encoded nascent peptide while within the ribosome and prevent formation of the stalling interaction.

            "text": "Single molecule FRET and small angle X-ray scattering experiments on the E. coli dnaX shift cassette (403,518,579), optical tweezer experiments and detailed product characterization (392) and parallel ensemble FRET kinetic experiments on a variant of the infectious bronchitis virus frameshift cassette (450), have greatly refined knowledge of \u22121 frameshifting, part of which will be discussed after some comments on the systems used (also see (580)). One of the smFRET experiments used a strengthened variant of the dnaX stem loop structure with a G inserted opposite a bulged C, and the A of an A:G apposition changed to a C (518), and the other used a stem with the same number of base pairs without any unpaired bases, though with a different sequence (403). The single ribosome trajectory experiments studied by optical tweezers, and the associated mass spectrometric analayses of products were performed with mRNAs with potential to form a stem of either 25 or 55 base pairs (392), instead of the 11 base pairs (including an A:U at the base of the stem) found to be functionally relevant in vivo (517). The calculated strength of variant dnaX stem loop structures correlates directly with frameshift efficiency (517) and even without the 5\u2032 Shine Dalgarno stimulator just substituting one base in the otherwise WT stem to allow uninterrupted pairing, causes 160% of WT frameshifting (80% of ribosomes shift frame). While further strengthening the stem may facilitate molecular tweezer experiments, it may also approach the \u2018roadblocking\u2019 effect seen with extra strong pseudoknots, especially given the expected interchangeability of simple stem loops and pseudoknots. Accordingly, any extrapolations from the finding of \u22124 frameshifting in the studies of (392) to biological relevance needs to be treated with caution. The ensemble FRET experiments (450) used a shift site, U_UUA_AAG, that is different from that of IBV, U_UUA_AAC and of dnaX, A_AAA_AAG and the identity of the different P-site tRNAs influences the type of shift occurring (395). [The whole pseudoknot or just its stem 1, can function in such heterologous expression systems (395,581) though with differing effectiveness.] It is unknown to what extent these, or other differences in the systems used, account for the discrepancies reported. One set of the dnaX results is interpreted to imply uncoupling of EF-G catalyzed translocation from standard ribosomal reverse rotation, leaving the ribosomes in a non-canonical rotated state during which the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA has potential to pair in the 0 or \u22121 frame (403) (see also (108)). In contrast, the other papers advocate slippage during tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation at the second codon of the shift site (392,450,518). Also relevant to these studies is the distance between the initiating Shine Dalgarno sequence and the internal frameshift stimulatory Shine Dalgarno sequence since pairing is maintained for translocation over several nts and adequate space has to be present to prevent interference (394,491,495).",

EF-G sampling is concurrent with continued Lys tRNA sampling at the A-site while slippage occurs.

Frameshift generated IS911 transposase activity is \u223c200-fold higher when it acts in cis than when supplied in trans. Pausing associated with the frameshifting influences cis preference presumably by facilitating sequential folding and cotranslational binding of the transposase (190). This in turn influences the (cis) preference for transposase to act directly on the IS element that encoded it rather than on other copies of the same element (190). Selective rational is provided by cells potentially having many copies of IS elements, and the need to tightly control transposition. Despite the elegance of this example, early pausing studies proved difficult. For a long time, some considered pausing as the key feature of programmed frameshifting with the nature of the shift site being the main determinant of the outcome of the non-standard event facilitated by the stall. Others hoped that the study of stimulators was not merely a study of different ways to induce a pause, with considerations of potential susceptibility to vacant A-site specific nuclease and tmRNA etc (see the 3rd next paragraph).",

            "text": "Classical pausing studies revealed a complicated picture. Several early studies investigated the relationship between pausing and frameshifting (78,80,585). One major paper on infectious bronchitis virus frameshifting concluded that ribosomal pausing at a frameshifter RNA pseudoknot is sensitive to reading phase but shows little correlation with frameshift efficiency (107). In several cases 3\u2032 structures that do not stimulate frameshifting cause similar pausing (78,107,585) (a subset of these were mutants of stimulatory structures). With the IBV pseudoknot, optical tweezer results reporting a correlation between the force for mechanical unwinding and stimulatory effectiveness (586) were later challenged (541). [A different situation pertains with simpler stem loop stimulators.] High resolution ribosome profiling of infected cells has just been performed but at the resolution of the technique no pausing at the frameshift site was detected though it was detected at other positions in the coding sequence (105). Few studies have focused on structural features that may influence ribosomes in a different way, but one is of an isolated luteoviral frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot. This work suggested that a segment not central to pseudoknot stability may influence frameshifting by direct interaction with ribosome components (524).",

A systematic study of this for Ty1 has just been completed (213) and only a few will be briefly mentioned here. Roles emerged for proteins such as Asc1/RACK1 (588), and the mammalian and bacterial ribosomal proteins L4 and L9, respectively (484,589). There is an intriguing connection between L9, whose N-terminal domain binds to the L1 stalk and which stretches via a long alpha helical region 80 \u01fa around the outside so that its C-terminal RNA binding domain can be near S6 on the small subunit (590) (Figure 17), and the bacterial counterpart, EF-P, of hypusine containing eEF5 (591). [The C-terminal domain of L9 restrains forward mRNA slippage (484) (Figure 17) and L9 is required for the growth of EF-P deficient cells (591).] Such studies also pointed to the care needed to avoid indirect effects, though they can be insightful for other processes. Searches for mutants of S. cerevisiae that increase frameshifting on an MMTV shift cassette sequence, and independently of L-A virus frameshifting (with loss of a satellite virus that encodes a killer toxin), led to the isolation of mutants of the UPF1 and UPF2 genes (592,593). Follow up work led to controversy that was only resolved with the demonstration that UPF mutants do not affect frameshifting, though they do affect product levels (594,595). [UPF genes are key mediators of NMD (nonsense mediated decay) and their name is derived from \u2018up-frameshift mutant suppressor\u2019 to reflect one of the paths taken to their discovery (596).]",

Lack of follow-up on reports of a 29 nt translational hop in decoding of an adhesion gene of the oral bacterium Prevotella loescheii, that is of dental interest (602), was partly due to difficulty in getting it to function in E. coli.

            "text": "The following is intended to complement the contents of a different type of review (611) of this topic. In contrast to triplet tRNA anticodon: codon interaction, the hybrid lengths central to DNA dependent RNA polymerases, and RNA dependent DNA polymerases, are much longer and of course without the counterpart of an adjacent tRNA (Thermus thermophilus RNAP hybrid oscilates between 9 and 10 bp during forward and backward translocation on DNA). Post initiation region slippage by bacterial RNA polymerase was initially detected in vitro (612) and shown to occur with high efficiency in vivo with a run of 9 As or Ts (613). Productive utilization of slippage at 9 Ts in the Thermus thermophilus dnaX gene yields a heterogeneous population of mRNAs with 1 or multiple additional As in a diminishing proportion such that standard translation yields about 50% of the product being full length (323). Without context features, slippage is not detectable at TTTTTCCCCC (T5C5). However, an IS element from Roseiflexus bacteria utilizes context-dependent slippage at this sequence to generate transcripts lacking a C residue within the corresponding U5C4 mRNA. Standard translation of these mRNAs yields its transposase (99). The enabling context feature is formation of a nascent RNA stem loop structure from the inverted repeat sequence, GCGGGCgcaaGCCCGC 5\u2032 adjacent to the U5C5/U5C4 motif (99) (Figure 18). [This is just one of the types of regulatory events that can come from RNA polymerase: nascent RNA structure interactions, with RNA polymerase progression involving a \u2018rugged kinetic landscape\u2019 (614).] This programmed unidirectional specific slippage occurs uniquely at the C4 position of the T5C5 motif. Inviability of more than one rU:dG and even one rC:dA mismatch prevents a two-base deletion and any insertions, respectively, making it quite distinct from the slippage on 9 Ts in T. thermophilus dnaX. While transient realignment occurs on a broad variety of heteropolymeric sequences, rapid reversal prevents deletions and insertions in the mRNA unless additional sequence elements that inhibit the reversal are present. S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase can also slip on a cassette with the same T5C5 sequence (99). The proposed mechanical model involving the RNAP translocation state differs from that proposed for Paramyxovirinae \u2018programmed transcriptional frameshifting\u2019, where, following random movement, efficiency is mainly dependent on the stability of the new realigned hybrid. The Sendai virus slippage sequence is 3\u2032 (Uug)UUUUUUCCC 5\u2032 and 30% of the mRNA synthesized from the P-gene has an additional G residue that causes ribosomes, by standard translation, to enter the coding sequence for the host-defense inactivating V protein. This is the sole Sendai virus alternative product to P, an essential viral polymerase co-factor, for synthesis that initiates with the P-gene start site (615). However, with parainfluenza virus type 3 there is an additional product due to the realignment within its P-gene yielding separate RNAs that permit standard translational access to both alternative ORFs. This realignment involves 1 to 6 Gs being added with approximately equal frequency. Most of the relevant features are in its (Uaa)U6C3 slippage sequence and when Sendai's UugU6C3 is replaced within the Sendai virus context by UaaU6C3, the slippage becomes parainfluenza virus type 3-like. The relevant context feature is the phasing of the binding of multiple nucleocapsid proteins (N) that sheath the genomic negative-strand (and positive-strand antigenome) of these viruses. Such binding prevents complementary progeny positive-strand mRNAs from annealing with the genomic RNA. Each adjacent N protein binds precisely 6 nts of genomic RNA (615), and adjusting the phasing of hexamer binding to two particular phases, causes the pattern of G inserts in progeny RNA to revert to the Sendai-virus pattern. Even when N is displaced from the genomic RNA by polymerase, it apparently remains closely associated with the polymerase and its hexamer phasing is thought to influence polymerase pausing at the slippage site with realignment consequences (616,163). The genome length is such that there is full phasing coverage and for the different species their respective phasing number is coordinated with that required for realignment by the relevant polymerase (Figure 19). N binding is also relevant to avoidance of G insertion genomic fixation, with deleterious consequences for P protein synthesis, as only genomes with length an exact multiple of 6 nts are efficiently replicated (616). A few paramyxoviruses, including Nipah virus, a member of the less well known Henipavirus genus, exhibit hyper transcriptional slippage, with some unresolved mechanistic issues (617,618).",

For these viruses, a distinctive mechanism for avoidance of replication of slippage-derived transcripts has been proposed (42). It is based on translation of a region near the 3\u2032 end of the polyprotein ORF being required for the genome to be used in cis as a replication template (173). Ribosomes translating slippage-derived transcripts will encounter stop codons before reaching that region, putatively precluding RNA with the extra A from being efficiently replicated. Though the slippage-derived RNA is 1 nt longer than the genomic RNA, it is the functional equivalent of a sub-genomic RNA in that it is (putatively) not replicated and is template for the synthesis of a subset of viral products. Since in positive-sense RNA virus transcription, unlike in negative-sense RNA virus transcription, the template: nascent RNA duplex is likely to extend a considerable distance behind the RNA polymerase footprint (possibly only being dissociated when the next polymerase passes), potyvirus slippage may require formation of a bulge nucleotide (42).",

Ty3 frameshifting efficiency varies up to 10-fold depending on the carbon source, but in contrast to Ty2, it is lower in glucose grown cells than in poorer carbon-source media (625). Previously it was shown that Ty3 Pol and transposition decreases dramatically with high temperature or growth in ethanol (626) where the frameshifting rate is greatly reduced (216). (Possible cold shock effects have in general not been studied to date.) Genetic studies strongly indicate that under growth in the poorer carbon sources, one or two kinases phosphorylate the ribosome-associated protein Stm1p which in turn affects the Ty3 frameshifting level (216). Stm1p is involved in the regulation of eEF3, a yeast-specific elongation factor that facilitates binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site. How many other cases of retrotransposon frameshifting are responsive to alterations of the translation elongation process is a significant unresolved issue. Perhaps mechanistically quite distinct, but an indication of the potential diversity is that there is elevated D. melanogaster 1731 retrotransposon gag-pol frameshifting in males compared to females (627).",

It is clear from two major studies and earlier work cited that in bacteria certain tRNA undermodification enhances frameshifting (391,631) and metabolism and growth conditions influence modification levels (632). Of relevance to ribosomal frameshifting at U-rich sequences are studies in thermophilic archaea (633,634) and in Drosophila (635) which have shown organism-specific differences in the degree of conversion of 1-methyl G to wye in the tRNAPhe anticodon loop. Studies in S. cerevisiae with the frameshifting utilized by the double-stranded RNA virus L-A found increases with reduced wye modification of tRNAPhe leading the authors to wonder if the degree of modification in some organisms is related to finely tuned tRNAPhe -dependent frameshifting (636).",

However, in a number of retroviruses, including Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), GagPol is synthesized via in-frame readthrough of a UAG stop codon (92,93) rather than via frameshifting. It uses a stimulatory pseudoknot that is only rather ineffectively substituted by its counterpart mouse mammary tumor virus frameshifting stimulatory pseudoknot even though they are similarly positioned 3\u2032 of the recoding sites (637). Substituting instead the HIV frameshift stimulatory signals resulted in readthrough levels only 2- to 3-fold lower than WT (638). Experiments with two plant viruses that utilize readthrough to express their RNA dependent RNA polymerase, showed that recoding signals of one of them, carnation Italian ringspot virus (genus Tombusvirus) was partially functional for stimulating frameshifting whereas that of the other, tobacco necrosis virus D (genus Betanecrovirus), was not (639).

A new screen and subsequent modification has yielded a compound with much greater specificity, and yet causes a 50% increase in frameshifting (685). Other approaches to increase specificity have been followed including recent modification of RNA binding peptides (686). A detailed review on this topic is available (682). Other studies have been on the pokeweed protein (687) and on ligand binding to a riboswitch (688).

However, the main motivation of synthetic oligonucleotide work has been for the mechanistic insights it can provide and as part of an exploration of different potential ways of being able to generate frameshifting that could partially compensate for a nearby genetic disease causing frameshift mutation. Modified synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to a sequence 3\u2032 of known or potential frameshift sites lacking 3\u2032 intra-mRNA structural frameshift stimulators were tested for their potential to stimulate frameshifting (98,690\u2013693). They showed unexpected spacing features. It is unclear if these findings presage natural trans-acting mRNAs (the miRNAs that influence CCR5 frameshifting bind to 3\u2032 structural stimulators (27) rather than to unfolded mRNA). However, no practical reagents of this type for causing compensatory frameshifting for frameshift mutation mediated human genetic disease have yet been developed. Effects of synthetic oligonucleotide binding 5\u2032 of shift sites has also been studied (505).",

While the large battery of proteases would rapidly destroy most proteins, this may not apply to all whether abberant or normally utilized, with potentially significant effects in special cases perhaps even for neurodegenerative disease (369). Treatment of Clostridium perfringens infected horses with gentamycin or streptomycin caused in-frame restorative frameshifting in the decoding of a cryptic gene whose product is involved in the synthesis of a toxin that causes more accentuated and fatal progression of equine typhlocolitis (694). At a substantial majority of frameshift sites, streptomycin does not cause detectable frameshifting, but at some it does (671) and is not surprising (369), due to aminoglycosides causing increased acceptance of near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA and reduced acceptance time (402,695). However, even gentamycin and paromomycin which in general are more effective than streptomycin, commonly cause only very modest increases in frameshifting (696). The oxazolidinones, linezolid and especially R chi-01 promote more but still often modest levels of frameshifting (696,697).",

This presentation of peptides enables lymphocyte-mediated immunosurveillance important for viral and tumor immunity. It is upregulated by interferons and certain other cytokines. In addition to peptides being derived from mature \u2018retiree\u2019 proteins, a proportion of the peptides come from proteins being synthesized, or directly afterward. Part of the initial reason for appreciating this came from the rapid time after viral infection that infected cells display viral antigens recognized by specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, with viral counter-attack being relevant (701). This led to the DRiP (Defective Ribosomal Products) hypothesis (702) which was later broadened to include products derived from ribosomal frameshifting (703,704), transcriptional indels (705), various other non-standard events and notably potential specialized ribosomes \u2018immuno-ribosomes\u2019 (706). Detection is highly sensitive and antibiotic treatment can affect such peptide display (707). There are numerous fascinating and important unanswered questions about the origin of peptides selected for display, and the extent of relevance of cotranslational protein degradation (708) and of frameshifting are only a couple of the unknowns.",

However, from the discovery of the general nature of decoding (159) until two years after completion in 1966 of the deciphering of codon assignments, the pendulum swung too far and it was thought that framing was so hard-wired that frameshifting did not, and could not be made to, occur. The practical manifestation at the time, some \u2018ten\u2019 years in advance of the development of DNA sequencing, was the perception that a mutation could not be a frameshift mutation if it was leaky (allowed the synthesis of some full-length product), or could not be suppressible by a secondary \u2018suppressor\u2019 mutation of some translational component, i.e by mutation of a gene at a separate location from the gene containing the original frameshift mutation (709\u2013711). These misconceptions of sacrosanct framing were corrected with the discovery of (i) frameshift mutant extragenic suppressors (712,713) that, as expected, were later shown to be mutants of various translation components that compensate for a framing \u2018problem\u2019 (439,440), (ii) frameshifting by the WT translational apparatus as evidenced by frameshift mutant \u2018leakiness\u2019 (393,714) and (iii) the first identified viral encoded frameshift products (73,74). However, it took the advent of general availability of synthetic oligonucleotides of specified sequence and more extensive sequencing in 1984 to facilitate the discoveries that brought utilized frameshifting to widespread interest. While this occurred in 1985 with yeast Ty (206,715), release factor 2 (350) and retroviral frameshifting (76), follow-up work was needed to show at what level it occurred, see above, by which time coronaviral frameshifting was discovered (103). Parallel developments with other phenomena permitted appreciation of common features involved in various ways of utilizating non-standard decoding, and the dynamic competition with standard decoding. This led to a new word, recoding or reprogrammed genetic decoding (716\u2013718). In contrast to this use for naturally occurring organisms, the same word was later used somewhat differently in connection with human intervention to \u2018genomically recode organisms\u2019 (719), though several of the authors involved are now using a different term for that meaning (720). [Distinctions between natural recoding and complete reassignment of the meaning of a codon wherever it occurs irrespective of context, have been highlighted (721) while word usage evolves, clarity about the intended meaning is key.]",

Despite the elegance of this scheme, several of the different models for the origin of decoding are relevant for those with the mindset of a less sacrosanct view of framing and an appreciation that Crick's frozen accident thesis (727) has considerably melted (728). These models involve stereochemical interactions between amino acids and RNA, proto mRNAs evolving as linkers between peptidated RNAs and tRNAs derived from replicators involving parallel duplication (729\u2013731). Further to the framing latitude considered in the last paragraph due to dissociation and re-pairing, there has been consideration of greater than triplet codon: anticodon interactions by proto tRNAs (722,723), and perhaps even of tRNA mimics (486). While at least the great majority of frameshifting with WT translational components considered above involves at least one tRNA anticodon dissociating and re-pairing in a new frame, that of Ty3 has been proposed not to do so (214) and there is considerable doubt about a case of non-cognate frameshifting (452,453). Similarily among the frameshift mutant suppressors that have altered tRNAs, though some involve anticodon racheting, in at least the great majority the evidence points to no more than 3 anticodon loop nts being paired to mRNA at one time (440,732).",

However, for now the main excitement is the prospect of being able to ascertain the extent to which productive frameshifting is utilized to enrich gene expression and, with the recent advances in biophysical techniques, to at last understand how ribosomes sense and respond to recoding signals. In conclusion the study of frameshifting has matured by reaching the final stage of Jonas Salk's 1958 trajectory for scientific discoveries: The way an idea eventually becomes an accepted truth is revealed by the stages through which it passes: First, it is said that \u2018It can't be true\u2019; then, \u2018If true, it is not very important\u2019; and finally, \u2018We knew it all along.\u2019 UGA-C.",

Embellishing the old adage \u2018From tapes to shapes\u2019 (proteins), in several cases this involves \u2018shapes-in-the-tapes\u2019 unlike counterparts in many human languages. The process is dynamic, and the competition yields products from both standard reading and frameshifted reading. The relative proportions of the products from each are case dependent. Examples of genetic cryptography involving translational bypassing are in the decoding of phage T4 gene 60 and the mitochondrial genome of the yeast Magnusiomyces capitatus (56,65,158) and another type is in decoding the mitochondrial genome of glass sponges (252). The latter is a WT translation component counterpart of the suppression of frameshift mutants by suppressor mutants of translational components. Examples of genetic steganography involving transcriptional realignment are in the gene expression of paramyxoviruses, potyviruses and the bacterial insertion sequence Roseiflexus IS630 (42,99,617); examples of genetic steganography involving ribosomal frameshifting are in the decoding of influenza A virus expression (125,270) and D. melanogaster APC (46). While standard expression of most bacterial release factor 2 genes, and also probably eukaryotic antizyme genes except for antizyme 3, yields a product that is non-functional on its own, the +1 frameshifting required for productive expression has been positively selected. The representation was inspired in part by a genetic framing garden \u2018rebus\u2019 (812), a slide by V.N. Gladyshev and a recent publication (1).",

The top box represents low cellular polyamine concentrations, where ribosomes pause at the frameshifting site (RFS) with the ORF1 stop codon in the ribosomal A-site.

When a ribosome approaches the 3\u2032 end of ORF2, a newly synthesized part of the nascent peptide, causes this ribosome (pink) to stall. Following translating ribosomes (green) encounter the stalled ribosome and their movement is also blocked (line 2 with multiple pink ribosomes). When polyamine levels are high (lower panel) the nascent peptide encoded near the 3\u2032 end of ORF2, binds polyamines and is then unable to cause stalling. This allows the ribosome containing it to proceed to termination and release of functional antizyme.

This frameshifting is stimulated in trans by virus-encoded nsp1\u03b2 in complex with poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). (D) Listeria phage PSA. Capsid and tail shaft encoding genes utilize +1 ribosomal frameshifting on a proline codon just 5\u2032 of either a stimulatory pseudoknot (capsid) or stop codon (tail shaft).",

Phage lambda and many other dsDNA phages gene g encodes gpG, a tail assembly chaperone, that binds to multiple regions of the tape measure protein gpH. Near the 3\u2032 end of the g coding sequence, a small proportion of translating ribosomes shift \u20131 and continue to synthesize the fusion protein gpGT. The \u2018G\u2019 portion of gpGT binds to the tape measure protein gpH, while the \u2018T\u2019 region binds the major tail protein gpV, linking them and mediating the initiation of gpV on gpH. However, gpG and gpGT both dissociate from the assembly, aiding the fast polymerization of gpV on the initiator complex to form the mature tail. Finally, the head binds to the fully mature tail to form phage lambda.

In extracts of E. coli with unperturbed tRNA balance, tRNAThr decodes a proline codon to cause \u22121 frameshifting that results in synthesis of a 66 K form of the viral encoded component, synthetase, of replicase. Increasing the relative amount of tRNAThr (red wedge) increases the proportion of 66 K with respect to the product of standard decoding (62 K). With elevated levels of tRNAThr (uniform thickness red line) increasing the amount of cognate tRNAPro (blue wedge) decreases the relative amount of 66 K.
