            "text": "Organ transplantation is an essential and efficient approach to replacing a dysfunctional organ in patients suffering from an end-stage organ disease. However, allogeneic transplantation induces a series of allograft rejection episodes and immune responses, which are mainly mediated by alloreactive T cells (1, 2). Therefore, global immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine (CsA), are needed to stop acute allograft rejection by suppressing T cell activation. On the other hand, regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in maintaining allograft survival or tolerance by inhibiting alloreactive T cell activation (3) while a reduction in their generation or activation contributes to allograft rejection (4). Although conventional immunosuppressants can prevent acute rejection, they may also cause severe side effects, including tumors and infections. Furthermore, a global immunosuppressive agent, such as CsA, inhibits the generation and function of Tregs (5, 6), likely hindering tolerance induction. Although another global immunosuppressant rapamycin, a typical mTOR inhibitor, can spare Tregs (7, 8), it may still cause same side effects as other global immunosuppressive agents do. Therefore, it is imperative to seek an alternative immunosuppressant that does not compromise Tregs, yet with high efficiency in suppression, low toxicity, and high affordability.",

Recently, many studies have also documented laxative effects of emodin as well as its inhibitory effects on tumors (12), viruses (13), bacteria (14), and inflammation (15) without any major side effect. Furthermore, emodin is also available in China at a low cost. Therefore, emodin may exhibit unique advantages over other mTOR inhibitors in terms of the side effect issue and affordability.",

            "text": "Two previous publications have demonstrated that emodin inhibits acute allograft rejection after liver transplantation in an animal model (16, 17). Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its suppression of liver allograft rejection are unknown. It is also unclear whether emodin suppresses rejection of other types of organ transplants beyond a liver allograft, which may develop spontaneous tolerance. In this study, we found that emodin significantly prolonged survival of a skin allograft, a stringent transplant model. Combined treatments with both emodin and CsA further extended the skin allograft survival. Emodin significantly increased the frequencies of both CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD122+ Tregs while reducing the numbers of effector CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, CD4+CD25+ Tregs isolated from emodin-treated recipient mice were more potent in suppression of allograft rejection than those derived from control recipients, suggesting that emodin enhances CD4+CD25+ Treg function. Emodin also suppressed alloantibody production and hindered dendritic cell (DC) maturation posttransplantation. Finally, we demonstrated that emodin inhibited T cell proliferation in vitro and blocked their mTOR signal transduction.",

However, in addition to its common side effects, CsA hinders allograft tolerance by dampening CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs (24, 25). Therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic drugs for suppressing allograft rejection with few side effects. In particular, an immunosuppressive agent that spares Tregs is highly preferred. Using a mouse model of skin transplantation, we analyzed the efficacy of emodin, a natural molecule extracted from R. palmatum, in suppression of transplant rejection. Our data demonstrated that emodin suppressed T cell infiltration in an allograft and prolonged the allograft survival. Further, administration of emodin induced both CD4+FoxP3+ and CD8+CD122+ Tregs while inhibiting the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells in transplanted mice. Emodin also suppressed alloantibody production and hindered DC maturation posttransplantation. Finally, emodin suppressed T cell proliferation and mTOR signaling in vitro. Thus, emodin may represent a newly emerging immunosuppressant that could be utilized in clinical transplantation.",

They represent only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells and express \u03b1 chain of IL-2 receptor (CD25) (27\u201329). Either induction of endogenous CD4+CD25+ Tregs or adoptive transfer of exogenous Tregs prevents autoimmune diseases and allograft rejection in animal models (30\u201337). Here, we found that emodin upregulated CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in the draining LNs of transplanted mice while CsA reduced their numbers, suggesting that emodin and CsA suppress allograft rejection via a totally different mechanism. CsA is a common immunosuppressant for suppression of allograft rejection through the formation of a cyclosporin\u2013cyclophilin complex and prevention of T cell activation (38), resulting in reduced IL-2 expression, impaired generation of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs (39, 40) and compromised tolerance. In our studies, CsA treatment led to similar reductions in the frequencies and numbers of Tregs, which were reversed by emodin administration, suggesting that emodin can correct the deficiency of CsA in terms of its repression of Tregs. Thus, potential tolerance-breaking effects of CsA may be offset by emodin. It is unclear why the frequencies and numbers of these Tregs in spleens were not affected by emodin. It is possible that an increase in Tregs in the draining LNs of the recipient mice treated with emodin was due to the presence of alloantigen-specific Tregs given that Ag-specific T/Treg cell frequencies are generally lower in spleens than in the draining LNs. On the other hand, depletion of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs mostly reversed allograft survival extended by emodin, indicating that suppression of allograft rejection by emodin is mostly dependent on CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs.",

In this study, we found that both emodin and CsA significantly increased the frequency of CD8+CD122+ Tregs in both LNs and spleens of the recipients, indicating that the signaling pathways activating CD8+CD122+ Tregs are different from those activating CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs. Interestingly, emodin augmented the absolute number of CD8+CD122+ Tregs in the LNs, but not the spleen. It is possible that most Tregs induced by emodin migrated to the draining LNs or the allograft. On the other hand, neither emodin nor CsA enhanced the suppressive capacity of CD8+CD122+ Tregs, implying that emodin-induced CD8+CD122+ Tregs are not necessarily alloantigen-specific. Furthermore, depletion of CD8+CD122+ Tregs only partially reversed allograft survival induced by emodin, indicating that inhibition of allograft rejection by emodin is not totally dependent on CD8+CD122+ Tregs.",

We, therefore, speculated that emodin exerted its suppressive effects on T cell responses via inhibition of mTOR signaling, leading to an increase in the Treg generation. Indeed, we found that emodin-treated T cells exhibited a dramatic decrease in the activation of their mTOR signaling, which is induced by TCR stimulation (51), and also a reduction in their proliferation, indicating that emodin suppresses allograft rejection by blocking T-cell mTOR signaling, leading to the Treg generation, which in turn prolongs allograft survival.",

Draining lymph node (LN) and spleen cells were isolated from B6 recipient mice that were transplanted with BALB/c skin and treated with CsA and/or emodin. 10 days after allogeneic skin transplantation, CD11c+CD86+\n(A) and CD11c+CD80+\n(B) DCs in recipients were enumerated by flow cytometry. Bar graphs represent the absolute numbers of the DCs. Data were pooled from three separate experiments and presented as means \u00b1 SD (n = 6\u20139 mice).",
