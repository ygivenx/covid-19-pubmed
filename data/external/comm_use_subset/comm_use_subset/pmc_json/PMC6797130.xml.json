Bacterial diversity was found to be significantly reduced in these subjects with many patients dominated with Streptococcus sp. Further investigation into the streptococcal species, which is unable to be elucidated from 16S rRNA sequencing, would be important in further investigations. Longitudinal studies in young children to determine if low bacterial diversity in the respiratory tract is a risk factor for or the result of bronchiolitis would be important for future investigations.",

These studies show haemophilus, streptococcus, moraxella associated with acute respiratory tract infections and staphylococcus, alloiococcus and corynebacterium in healthy samples. A number of factors account for the differences we find; firstly, they analyse nasopharyngeal (NP) samples compared to the OP samples analysed in our study. A number of studies have shown that these areas show significantly different bacterial communities, and that OP swabs are a better proxy for the lower respiratory tract microbiome. There are also age differences between other cohorts and ours.",

Analytical methods for microbiota are slowly being standardised, and much of the analytic techniques are borrowed from ecological analysis to try and accurately portray biodiversity and differences. In order to find differences, earlier studies have defaulted to simplistic groupings based on dominant organisms. However, we have observed that many samples are diverse and without a singular dominant organism. For example, Man et al, comparing those with lower respiratory tract infection and healthy controls, found no difference in alpha diversity, and using beta diversity measures found, similar to us, very small but significant differences between the groups (r2 = 0.0031, p = <0.0001) [28]. To find significant differences in species, previous studies grouped samples based on perceived dominance and not necessarily by a dominance measure or beta diversity based on hierarchical clustering.",

Whether acute OP swabs reflect lower airway samples in acute wheeze or acute viral episodes is still unclear but, interestingly, Man et al did show that intensive care patients had reasonable similarity between NP samples and lower respiratory tracheal samples (Bray Curtis similarity p = 0.61), but did find key differences, specifically that staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Dolosigranulum sp. were almost exclusively present in NP samples and absent from endotracheal aspirates [28].",
