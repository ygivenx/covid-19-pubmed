Current platforms for biosurveillance make use of event-based, unstructured data such as news feed aggregators and other publicly available data to monitor for emerging infectious disease spread within geographically distributed populations. Examples of such systems include the BioSense 2.0 program [4], GPHIN (Global Public Health Information Network) [5], PHIN (Public Health Information Network) [6], ProMED-Mail [7], HealthMap [8], Google Flu Trends, Bio-Caster, EpiSPIDER [9], EARS (Early Aberration Reporting System), BCON (biosurveillance Common Operating Network), PHESS (Indiana Public Health Emergency Surveillance System), LAHVA (Linked Animal-Human Health Visual Analytics), ESSENCE (Electronic Surveillance System for Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics) [10], RODS (Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance) [11], and GEIS (Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Reporting System) [12]. A detailed overview of these systems and their applications is further described in Shmueli and Burkhom [13]. These systems include tools for natural language processing (NLP) for parsing unstructured textual data, basic statistical analyses tools, time-series counts/ratios as well as geographic information system (GIS) based visualization that can summarize to the end-user the nature or urgency of an emerging infectious disease. It must be noted that most tools developed are specific to infectious diseases; although the tools can be used to analyze other non-infectious diseases, they are very rarely utilized for monitoring such conditions.",

While EHRs refer to an individual patient's medical history collected and processed at individual medical facilities (such as a clinic or hospital), claims refer to electronic records of claim transactions processed by retail pharmacies (and/or clinics). EHR and claims provide rich and timely information regarding prevailing medical conditions in any given geographic area; however, the use of EHR and claims for public health surveillance is still in its early stages. Privacy and security-related concerns, data disparity across diverse/individual clinics/hospitals, as well the sheer complexity involved in aggregating and processing such large-scale structured datasets can pose significant data analytic challenges for even simple public health surveillance tasks [31,32].",

While there is significant agreement within the public health community regarding the use of data analytics and informatics techniques as being central to the success of any biosurveillance program, the development of machine learning and data analytic techniques specifically designed to handle heterogeneous datasets at massive scales has been especially challenging. These challenges can be attributed to the lack of standards and tools that facilitate data/information exchange and secondly, to the lack of available data analytic frameworks that can automatically integrate heterogeneous datasets and analyze them in near real-time to provide insights into emerging public health problems. Additionally, the complex etiologies of diseases pose special challenges in developing analytic tools to monitor them. For example, the symptoms of the common flu and a serious outbreak such as West Nile virus can be very similar, but teasing out these symptoms from a context specific search of Twitter and other social media data can be quite challenging. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel machine learning tools that can not only handle large datasets, but can also simultaneously examine heterogeneous data sets to identify emerging patterns of disease spread across geographically distributed regions.",

The Oak Ridge Biosurveillance Toolkit (ORBiT) is being developed as a machine learning platform that processes both direct and indirect data sources by integrating insights from heterogeneous datasets for answering public health surveillance-related queries. In contrast to existing systems where the primary emphasis is on data collection, archival and visualization of specific datasets, ORBiT is being developed as a distributed, component based platform for novel statistical and machine learning tools that can provide insights into spatial and temporal patterns of public health emergencies. By tightly integrating the machine learning tools with visual analytics interfaces in a web-based framework, ORBiT allows analysts and other end-users to explore heterogeneous datasets to detect patterns/correlations across different data streams, identify emerging disease outbreaks and forecast outbreaks and monitor control strategies.",

We illustrate how the integration of heterogeneous data sources, including publicly accessible data from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), openly accessible data from Google Flu Trends and claims obtained from a private organization that consolidates diagnostic and prescription electronic transactions can provide timely and novel information regarding how the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic affected the entire US. Our analysis of these datasets shows that a small number of distinct temporal patterns govern how the pandemic spread throughout the country. Additionally, we extract intrinsic multi-scale patterns from the claims data, moving successively from local to regional to national patterns. These patterns depict the process by which the H1N1 flu spread across the entire country in distinct waves, each with its own unique temporal and spatial signatures. Although this study is a retrospective analysis of the 2009-2010 flu season, we show that the patterns can also translate into meaningful insights for future years, especially to interpret baselines.

The Rx data consists of over 3 billion claims collected annually and provides for a rich resource to monitor and track drug delivery and efficacy across the entire country. IMS Health uses proprietary technology to protect patient privacy and all of the data available/used for analysis are HIPAA-compliant.",

For organizing the data based on a specific geographic location, we used the provider's primary five digit zip code that was directly accessible from the claims data. Note that this assumption is reasonable, given that the patient's service provider/pharmacy is most likely to be co-located unless the patient remotely consults with his/her provider.

To explore the further use of claims data and to perform a retrospective analysis of the 2009-2010 pandemic flu within the US, we organized the ILI-related data from claims into a matrix A, that has the overall dimensions of Nz \u00d7 Nt, where Nz represents the total number of zip codes and Nt represents the total number of time points (365 days).",

Given prior knowledge that there are at least three distinct 'peaks' associated with the 2009-2010 pandemic [37], we want to extract low-dimensional representations for this claims data. Further, the flu incidence matrices have non-negative entries (i.e., it is not possible to obtain a negative count of patients reporting flu symptoms at a zip code).

Using the alternate least squares algorithm proposed by Paatero, available as part of Matlab, we ran NMF for 1,000 iterations. To identify an appropriate low-rank subspace (s), we iterated over s = 1 . . . 15, dividing the original data into training and testing data. We tracked the residual errors using the Frobenius norm for both training and testing data. For each choice of s, we performed a total of 250 iterations. Once the optimal s was selected, we report the most stable version of the basis matrices (W, H) by computing the KL divergence between every pair of the 250 instances of W from the training set and picking W with the lowest KL divergence value.",

The average agreement (quantified by the Pearson correlation) between the GFT and claims data is about 0.9 (with a p-value of 4E-11), even within individual HHS regions. However, the similarity is less pronounced with respect to the agreement between the CDC ILINet data and IMS Health claims data; we speculate that the publicly available information from ILINet has several incomplete entries for the same time period. Therefore, when we compare the data in a similar way to the GFT approach by removing the missing entries and extracting time segments which have reported data available, the agreement increases to about 0.9 (p-value of 4E-11).",

GFT data relies on a statistical model to identify search queries related to influenza. The ILINet data is primarily collected from outpatient visits and covers a small portion of the primary care facilities within the entire country. The claims data is, however, dependent on the primary care physician's reporting of transactions, which can vary across the nation (see next subsection).

As is well documented from previous studies [38,37,39], HHS-I and II correspond to the northeast (states including NY, NJ, CT, ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) that exhibited a distinct early onset of the flu pandemic followed by the peak observed in Oct-Nov 2009.

Notably, H1 shows a peak in ILI incidence around day 206-210, corresponding to a time period of Oct 24, 2009; H2 shows peak about a week earlier (Oct 18, 2009) followed by H3 peaking around Sep 28, 2009 and H4 showing a peak of Aug 19, 2009. H5 corresponds to an early flu outbreak observed in the early-middle spring time (May 31-Jun 5, 2009), which was distinctly observed across the North east HHS regions in Figure 1. Another notable aspect of H5 is that the early peak of the ILI-incidence is followed by a secondary peak in and around the same time of H1, indicating that the likely presence of an early flu season (in the spring season) also influenced the late peaks observed in the fall season (see below for explanation of the spatial patterns observed).

We define these bridge regions to be zip codes that exhibit more than one Wi at the same time-period. These zip codes, not surprisingly, are concentrated towards the different suburb regions of the different metropolitan cities in the state. For example, in the city of Memphis, there are distinct bridge regions where we observe that a cluster of three zip codes in the area corresponding to Bartlett (highlighted by a red rounded rectangle in Figure 4 across all the three spatial patterns) that exhibit W2, W3 and W4 patterns. Notably, this region showed very little flu during the early half of the season. Another example of a bridge region is highlighted by a purple circle in Figure 4 where W1, W3 and W4 patterns dominated in the suburbs of East Memphis. Only the area of Bartlett and Collierville show the presence of the early and late fly patterns (corresponding with the spatial pattern W5).",

Instead of examining specific spatial patterns, we examine the most dominant spatial pattern (Wi) in a given state or HHS region. A dominant pattern is defined as a spatial pattern that is prevalent in a specific zip code based on the maximum Wi value(s) within the zip codes that constitute the state (or HHS region). For this study, we decided to use a simple threshold of 50% to determine if a spatial pattern was dominant in that state/region. As summarized in Figure 5, the individual pie charts within each state captures the percentage contribution of each Wi that was dominant in that region, which provides an intuitive visual analysis of the regions impacted by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

It is also interesting to note that the very same regions that show W5 also exhibit a temporal coupling between the early and late part of the flu.

The temporal patterns shown in Figure 3 indicate different phases of the H1N1 flu epidemic. The multi-scale representation of the H1N1 epidemiological spread can be used as starting points for other complex types of analysis. For example, one extension would be to include evolutionary history of different H1N1 viral strains. The recent availability of large-scale sequence databases such as GISAID [41] can provide insights into specific viral strains that are prevalent within a geographic region. Tracing the phylogenetic relationship between different strains of the virus, we can then estimate parameters for disease spread models [42]. We can also incorporate the evolutionary information into statistical models [43,30] to understand the how viral evolution affects the disease spread process. Further, these patterns can be examined to identify regions that are vulnerable to specific strains and target them for early intervention. Such enhancements will be evaluated in forthcoming publications from our group.",

Apart from supporting machine learning algorithms from direct sources for public health surveillance, ORBiT can be used in other contexts including (1) extracting and analyzing emerging, indirect datasets for public health surveillance, e.g., Twitter [34]; and (2) integrating datasets such as claims to estimate parameters for disease spread models so that one can turn the analytical power from the aforementioned application into predictive models that can aid decision makers with more accurate insights [44].
