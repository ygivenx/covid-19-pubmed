The human outbreak was preceded by an outbreak of avian chlamydiosis among the detained Mealy Parrots (Amazona farinose). Although birds in the tropical and sub-tropical areas are commonly infected with C. psittaci, most infected birds are asymptomatic [6], [7]. Large human outbreaks are rare even among bird handlers [8]. Although co-infection of C. psittaci and viruses has been reported in outbreaks of avian species [9]\u2013[12], no virus-bacterium co-infection of implicated avian species has ever been reported in outbreaks of human psittacosis. In this study, we sought to investigate viruses that cause avian co-infection, which may have led to this outbreak of psittacosis.",

For adenovirus, we used a nested PCR as reported previously [19] and a single-step consensus PCR using primers designed by performing multiple alignments of pol genes of adenovirus and related sequences available in NCBI GenBank (Table 1). The PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3130xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California), using the PCR primers. The sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences by BLAST analysis against the NCBI database. For quantification of Psittacine adenovirus HKU1, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with specific primers was performed using LightCycler 96 system (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) (Table 1). Standards were included for quantification and no false-positive results were observed in the negative controls.

Briefly, complete genome sequences of the three strains of Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 were amplified and sequenced directly from the Mealy Parrot samples. Degenerate primers in regions of IVa, polymerase, pIIIa, hexon, 100K and fiber were designed by multiple alignment of genomes of related adenoviruses, including Bovine adenovirus 6 (GenBank accession no. NC_020074), Duck adenovirus A (GenBank accession no. NC_001813) and Ovine adenovirus D (GenBank accession no. NC_004037). Additional primers for subsequent rounds of PCR were designed based on the results of earlier rounds of genome sequencing. These primer sequences are available on request. Sequences for the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genome were obtained by random amplification of cDNA ends strategies using the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech). The sequence has been submitted to NCBI GenBank and is available under the accession number KJ675568.",

The fiber fragment was then cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of expression vector pET-28b(+) (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin) in frame and downstream of a series of six histidine residues. The His6-tagged recombinant fiber protein was expressed and purified by Ni2+-loaded HiTrap chelating system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific guinea pig antiserum was produced by injecting 200 \u00b5g of purified His6-tagged recombinant fiber protein, along with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant, into the thighs of guinea pigs intramuscularly. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used in subsequent immunizations. Three inoculations were completed in six weeks, with one injection every two weeks. Serum samples were collected two weeks after the last injection. Immunofluorescence staining for adenovirus fiber protein antigen was performed as described previously [30]. The tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS to minimize non-specific binding. The sections were incubated overnight with immune serum from guinea pigs at 4\u00b0C. After washing three times with PBS, the sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG (Life technology, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) at 1\u223650 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. The images were captured by Nikon 80i imaging system with Spot Advanced Software.

The full-length genomic sequence is 31,735 bp in length, with a G+C content of 53.5%. Inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions of 44 bp at both ends of the genome are complementary to each other. The viral genome contains 23 ORFs with sequence similarity to known adenoviral genes (Fig. 3 and Table 4). Additionally, six ORFs, ranging from 381 to 741 bp were identified at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. While lacking significant sequence similarity to known adenoviral sequences, they were predicted to have coding potential by fgenesV0. The genome organization of this novel virus most closely resembles that of Atadenovirus, with minor variations. Similar to Duck adenovirus A, the novel adenovirus lacks LH1, LH2 and LH3, which distinguishes it from the bovine adenovirus E, bovine adenovirus D and ovine adenovirus D. Similar to other Atadenovirus, the novel virus possesses a DNA polymerase, terminal protein and DNA-binding protein for DNA replication; the E1B small T-antigen, IVa2 and 52K proteins for DNA encapsidation; and the IIIa, penton protein/III, core protein 1/pVII, core protein 2/pX, pVI protein, hexon protein, endopeptidase/protease, 100K, pVIII protein and fiber protein for the formation and structure of the virion [31]. The novel adenovirus has two fiber proteins. Notably, the fiber-2 protein (or short fiber) is not found in any Atadenovirus, but can be found in Aviadenovirus. As in other adenoviruses, a putative splicing site was identified in the pTP gene. Recombination analysis by bootscanning showed possible phylogenetic incongruence in small regions of the viral genome (Fig. 4), but further examination by phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding regions did not reveal convincing evidence of recombination.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the hexon, penton and DNA polymerase amino acid sequences consistently showed clustering of the novel adenovirus with viruses in the genus Atadenovirus, most closely related to sequences from Duck adenovirus A (Fig. 5A\u20135C). The fiber-2 protein amino acid sequence of the novel adenovirus was most closely related to that of Fowl adenovirus C (Fig. 5D). In silico DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) using GGDC 2.0 was also performed to estimate genomic DNA similarity between the novel adenovirus and other adenoviruses. However, the estimated DDH values were at the lower limit of analysis (12.5% for formula 1, and 0% for formulae 2 and 3), which suggested that the genomic DNA sequences are too dissimilar for DDH analysis.",

In this study, we have identified a novel adenovirus that was most closely related to Duck adenovirus A of the Atadenovirus genus in the epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots. In contrast, this novel adenovirus was not identified in any of the healthy parrots and other detained animals without C. psittaci infection. Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 antigen was detected in lung and liver tissue cells using immunostaining, which indicated active viral replication instead of latent infection. A positive correlation between adenovirus viral loads with C. psittaci bacterial loads was observed in lung specimens, which suggested a possible synergistic interaction between adenovirus and C. psittaci in disease pathogenesis.",

            "text": "In birds, many adenoviral infections are subclinical, but some infections can lead to severe disease [32], [33]. Previous studies have suggested that avian adenoviruses may cause immunosuppression in birds. Aviadenovirus can lead to immunosuppressive disease, such as the hydropericardium syndrome. Fowl adenovirus and chicken anemia virus co-infection causes much more severe disease than either virus alone [34]. Avian adenoviruses have been shown to directly infect lymphocytes and dendritic cells in the spleen [35] and causes depletion of lymphocytes [36], [37]. Fowl adenovirus 1 has been shown to affect antibody response of chicks to Brucella abortus\n[38]. We speculate that our novel adenovirus may have caused immunosuppression among the infected parrots, and therefore a larger number of Mealy Parrots were infected by C. psittaci with a higher bacterial load, leading to a higher chance of zoonotic transmission to humans. Other studies have also proposed that reovirus and avian pneumovirus infection may cause immunosuppression leading to avian chlamydiosis [11], [12]. Experimental infection showed that avian pneumovirus could exacerbate acute C. psittaci infection in turkeys [12]. Alternatively, in a report demonstrating adenovirus-C. psittaci co-infection in a parakeet using electron microscopy and antigen detection without molecular confirmation, Desmidt M et al proposed that C. psittaci could cause immunosuppression, which can lead to reactivation of latent adenovirus infection [10]. However, no further studies have been performed to verify this hypothesis.",

With the exception of nucleotide composition and cross-neutralization, for which no data are available, our data and analysis of the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 are consistent with it being a novel member of the genus Atadenovirus. Notably, the genome of the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 has a higher G+C content than other Atadenovirus genomes, which might be viewed as a feature against its designation as a novel Atadenovirus. Indeed, the high A+T content of the first few identified Atadenoviruses was considered characteristic among adenoviruses and was the basis for naming the genus. Nonetheless, the snake adenovirus 1, a member of the Atadenovirus, has a genomic G+C content of 50.2%, which is lower than but comparable to the G+C content of 53.5% for the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1. Hence, we consider that the high genomic G+C content of the present Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 is not a major contraindication to its inclusion in the genus Atadenovirus.",

Firstly, a second viral protein, fiber-2, is present in our novel adenovirus, but not in any other Atadenovirus. The fiber-2 protein has also been found in the Aviadenovirus, like the fowl adenovirus. Since fiber proteins are responsible for binding to cellular receptor, it has been postulated that the presence of different fiber proteins may determine the tropism of the adenovirus [42]. It remains to be determined whether the fiber-2 protein is important for the virus to infect psittacine hosts. Another interesting feature is the predicted CCU start codon of the IVa2 protein. The annotation is made on the basis of sequence conservation among other adenoviral IVa2 proteins, and the lack of an in-frame ATG in its vicinity. The function of the non-canonical CCU start codon may be augmented by the presence of an upstream Kozak sequence ACCACC. The use of CCU as the start codon is rare in other organisms, but has been reported in psittacine viruses. The other notable genomic feature in the Psittacine adenovirus HKU1 is the intron between the two exons of 33K, which usually overlaps with coding sequences in other adenoviruses, but not in the present case.",

Infectious bursal disease virus and chicken anaemia virus can cause immunosuppression, leading to secondary bacterial infection such as bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis [43]. However, it is unclear whether co-infection in birds can increase the risk of transmission of avian pathogens to humans.
