The nature and the position of the substituents on the pyridinic moiety influence these pharmacological activities. These imidazopyridine heterocyclic structures form part of the skeleton of natural alkaloids, neuromuscular blocking agents [14], reversible inhibitors of the H+, K+-ATPase enzymes with a potent antisecretory activity, and are known to be sedative hypnotics of the nervous system [15]. In this study, we have proposed kinetically and thermodynamically characterized 1-substituted pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives as a potent and novel cysteine protease inhibitors which also acts as antibacterial agents.",

All the water molecules and heteroatoms were removed and hydrogen atoms were added to the protein. CharMm forcefield [17] was applied and the structure was subjected to energy minimization for 1000 steps using steepest descent method. The chemical structures of all the synthesized compounds were generated using chemdraw and were subsequently converted into 3D format using CORINA. A series of docking experiments were carried out with all the designed 1-substituted pyridylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine derivatives against papain using AutoDock Tools 4.0 [18] for possible cysteine-protease inhibitory activities. The compounds were selected on the basis of their binding energies and those reflecting good binding affinity were further analyzed on in silico platform. As a parameter for the molecular docking, the Lamarckian genetic algorithm, a combination between the genetic algorithm and the local search Pseudo-Solis and Wets algorithm, was employed. A grid box of 60\u00d760\u00d760 \u00c5 was generated around active site of papain making sure those inhibitors can freely rotate inside the grid. The number of docking runs was set to 10. Each docking was repeated five times, having in the end a total of 50 docking runs, to check the precision of results. The finally obtained docked complexes were subsequently visualized using PyMol [19]. The work was further authenticated in the wet lab after its detailed analysis on in silico platform.",

To solutions of active papain (final concentration: 0.05 mM) were added concentrated solutions of the different derivatives to final concentrations of 0.2 mM. After incubation for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, the substrate solution was added and after a further incubation for 20 min the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5% trichloric acid (TCA) acidified with 2.25% HCl and the absorbance of the reaction mixture was determined at a wavelength of 410 nm by Microplate Manager 4.0 (Bio-Rad laboratories). The same procedure was used at 32\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C for thermodynamics studies. The kinetic parameters for the substrate hydrolysis were determined by measuring the initial rate of enzymatic activity. The inhibition constant Ki was determined by Dixon method [24] and also by the Lineweaver\u2013Burk equation. The Km value was calculated from the double-reciprocal equation by fitting the data into the computer software Origin 6.1. The Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot was used to determine the types of inhibition. For the kinetic analysis and rate constant determinations, the assays were carried out in triplicate, and the average value was considered throughout this work.",

Several papain residues participated in hydrophobic interactions with compounds 3a\u2013d, including Gln19, Cys25, Gly66 and Asp158. The pyridine moieties of compounds 3a\u2013d interact with S2 site of papain which includes (Tyr61, Asn64, Gly65 & Tyr67) amino acids (\nFigure 2\n\nA\u2013D). The active site residues that were found to be key player in the interaction of compounds within the active site (mostly through hydrophobic interactions) were Cys25, Tyr61, His159 and Trp177, while Trp177, Gln19 were found to me making hydrogen bonds only with compound 3a.

Interestingly, the observed in silico binding energies for the compounds 3a\u2013d against papain were found to be in great agreement (standard error \u00b12 Kcal/mol) with the value of free energy of binding (\u0394G) observed during thermodynamics studies (\nTable 1\n\nand\n\n2\n). Similarly, enthalpy change (\u0394H) of the binding was negative whereas entropy (\u0394S) change of the binding was positive which indicated the exothermic and entropically driven nature of binding. This pattern of temperature dependence is characteristic of hydrophobic interaction [33]. As discussed earlier that all the compounds (3a\u2013d) were found to interact with the active site residues of papain through hydrophobic interactions at most instances during in silico studies, the same was observed by the analysis of Van\u2019t Hoff plots for all the proposed inhibitors at three different temperatures (32\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C) in wet lab experiments (\nFigure 3\n). This proves the importance of these types of interactions in the positioning of compounds within the active site. Hence, thermodynamics as well as in silico study reveals that hydrophobic interactions favor binding of these proposed inhibitors with papain like cysteine proteases. Further wet lab results proposed the non competitive interaction of compounds (3a, 3c & 3d) with papain except for compound 3b which showed competitive interaction. In sum up, the above results of molecular docking studies and thermodynamic analysis of compounds 3a\u2013d with papain showed that these compounds have the potential to be novel and unique cysteine protease inhibitors.",

Furthermore, the calculated IC50 values were also found to be 13.40, 21.17, 94.50 and 96.50 \u00b5M for compounds 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d respectively (\nTable 3\n). Except compound 3b, rest of the compounds showed non competitive, reversible inhibitions but all the compounds irrespective of types of binding, showed hydrophobic and entropically driven interaction. These derivatives (3a\u2013j) were eventually evaluated for their antibacterial activities against seven clinically important microbes (S. aureus, P. vulgaris, Group D Streptococci, Bacillus sp., E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. morganii). Here, we are showing the data of only four compounds (3a\u2013d) because of their significant results (\nTable 4\n). All the compounds strictly followed the pattern of antiprotease activity towards bacterial growth except P. vulgaris and E. coli at one instance each (\n\nTable 4\n\n). Since compound 3c & 3d do not have much difference in their IC50 values (3c-94.5 \u00b5M and 3d-96.5 \u00b5M) against cysteine protease, papain and hence in antibacterial activity in all instances except one. It might be random due to so close in IC50 values. Compounds 3c & 3d are having much difference in their IC50 values (3b-21.17 \u00b5M and 3c-94.5 \u00b5M) and they showed exact pattern for their antibacterial activity for all microbes except for E. coli at one instance. Although, E. coli does contain six major cysteine proteases but none belong to the CA clan of papain. It is argued that these compounds also inhibited the cysteine proteases of other clan than papain but with low efficacy.",

So, Clotrimazole (1-[(2-chlorophenyl)(diphenyl)methyl]-1H-imidazole), an imidazole derivatives and Ceftriaxone (third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic with broad spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) have been used as positive control whereas DMSO has been used as negative control. All the above mentioned bacterial species have been shown to secrete certain cysteine proteases which play very important role in the pathogenecity of different diseases caused by these microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of compounds (3a\u2013d) (\nTable 4\n) against all tested bacteria except E. coli and P. vulgaris, were observed to be in great agreement with their respective inhibition constant (Ki)/IC50 values against papain (\n\nTable 3\n\n) which clearly indicates that these compounds have the potential to inhibit the papain like cysteine proteases of these pathogens. The partition coefficient (logP) is a well-established measure of the compound\u2019s lipophilicity. The distribution of calculated logP (cLogP) values of a majority of drugs in the market is in the range of zero to five. All the compounds studied except 3d, showed good agreement with the criteria laid down for the prediction of a compound to be a potential drug (\nTable 5\n). All the compounds do not show any threat against toxicity risk assessment except compound 3d which showed threat as tumorogenic effect due to the presence of isobutyl group. Among all the tested compounds, compound 3a was the most potent whose MIC was the lowest among all the tested compounds and showed maximum drug score and positive values for drug likeness.",
