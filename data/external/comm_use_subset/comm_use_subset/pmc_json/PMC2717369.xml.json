Second, no vaccine or specific treatment may be known initially.

The outbreak also demonstrated the possible existence of super-spreading events (SSEs) [10], during which a few infectious individuals contaminated a high number of secondary cases. Hong Kong had two SSEs: the first occurred in Hospital X around March 3 and led to about 125 cases [11]; the second occurred in Housing Estate Y on March 19, and led to over 300 cases [12],[13].

While the daily effective contact rates are sensitive to short-term day-to-day variations in transmission, the reproduction numbers reflect the integrated influences of the temporal evolution of effective contact rates, the infectious period duration and other factors, such as time spent in the community before hospitalization. Here, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were obtained for each social category. Notably, unlike Cauchemez et al. [14], it was not necessary to assume prior knowledge or constancy of the generation interval. The reproduction numbers showed a trend similar to the effective contact rates, with a clearly decreasing trend over time, suggesting that the epidemic was under control as early as mid-March (see Figure in Text S3). Moreover, the temporal patterns for the general population and healthcare workers were similar, with the reproduction numbers being higher for the general population, thereby indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person. The reproduction numbers for nosocomial cases were much lower, either because they had fewer contacts or because the people they were in contact with were protected (typically healthcare workers wearing masks).",

The number of people affected by each SSE (i.e. population\u00d7duration\u00d7strength) was therefore correct, but its extent in time less robust. Ignoring the 17 days corresponding to both SSEs, 98% of the remaining parameters used for simulation were inside the posterior corresponding 95% credible intervals, indicating very little bias in our estimation procedure.",

Similarly, a more detailed model taking into account household transmission, and transmission inside and between hospitals, rather than assuming homogeneous mixing in the community and in hospitals, could be implemented, at the cost of a dramatic increase in the number of model parameters.
