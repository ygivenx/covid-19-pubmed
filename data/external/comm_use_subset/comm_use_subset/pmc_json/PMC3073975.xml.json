            "text": "Interferons (IFN) were first discovered over 50 years ago by Isaacs and Lindenmann [1]. Due to its complexity, the IFN system is still little understood and remains a subject of intensive research. Currently, three types of IFNs are distinguished \u2013 type I, type II consisting of only IFN-\u03b3, and the recently discovered type III also called IFN-\u03bb. Here, we will focus on type I IFN. This family of cytokines comprises a single IFN-\u03b2, more than 13 IFN-\u03b1, and several other less well characterized members [2], [3]. All these subtypes signal through a common cell surface receptor (IFNAR) to activate IFN-inducible genes that exert a wide range of effects central to innate and adaptive immunity [2]. As a rule, IFN-\u03b2 is produced as the earliest of type I IFN initiating a cascade of IFN-\u03b1 via autocrine and paracrine loops [4], [5]. In addition, during viral infections type I IFN may be induced in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) also named \u201cnatural interferon producing cells\u201d. Due to constitutive expression of the transcription factor IRF-7, pDCs are able to immediately produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 [6]. Non-viral pathogens (i.e., bacteria, protozoa, fungi and helminthes) may also induce type I IFN. Interestingly, in contrast to viral infections where IFNs are normally protective, in non-viral infections IFN production might be defensive or deleterious [7], [8].",

L. monocytogenes induces type I IFN synthesis via triggering a still uncharacterized pattern recognition receptor in the cytosol of host cells [10], [11]. Cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), secreted by L. monocytogenes, might be one of the cytosolic activators of type I IFN [12].

At 24 hours post infection (p.i.), IFN-\u03b2 induction occurred almost exclusively in the spleen. Interestingly, 48 hours p.i. a bright luminescent signal appeared in the cervical and in the inguinal lymph nodes, especially when using the LO28 strain. At this time, no production of IFN-\u03b2 was detectable in the spleen any longer. Loss of the signal from the spleen 48 hours p.i. could be due to complete destruction of spleen together with the massive apoptosis of lymphocytes [32]. Quantitation of luciferase activity in the selected regions of interest (Fig. 1A, circles 1 and 2 for spleen and cervical lymph nodes, respectively) showed that LO28, induced a stronger signal compared to EGDe (Fig. 1B), although colonization by bacteria was comparable (Fig. 1C). This confirmed the findings by Reutterer et al. that LO28 is the most potent type I IFN stimulator amongst the commonly used Listeria strains [31]. Of note, there was no significant signal from the liver at any time point, although this organ is highly colonized by Listeria.",

By extrapolation, a contribution of pDC to the type I IFN response after systemic Listeria infection could be expected, although in vitro stimulation of splenic pDC with Listeria did not induce type I IFN [28]. To evaluate the contribution of pDC to the overall IFN production in vivo after Listeria monocytogenes infection, we performed depletion experiments. To this end, 24 hours prior to infection mice were intravenously injected with the depleting antibody anti-mPDCA-1. 24 hours p.i. spleens were analyzed for the presence of pDCs.

Importantly, IFN-\u03b2 production was identical in C57BL/6 and IFN-\u03b2flox\u03b2-luc/flox\u03b2-luc mice, while the extent of IFN-\u03b2 expression was dramatically reduced in IFN-\u03b2flox\u03b2-luc/flox\u03b2-luc x LysMcre mice. As a consequence, since type I IFN induction in macrophages depends on feedback signaling, total IFN-\u03b1 levels were also markedly reduced in IFN-\u03b2flox\u03b2-luc/flox\u03b2-luc x LysMcre mice and they were similar to the levels in IFN-\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6A).",

Neutrophils are essential during the early innate response to Listeria monocytogenes and are known to be capable to produce various cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-18 and reactive oxygen intermediates in response to different stimuli [40]\u2013[43]. However, the contribution of neutrophils to type I IFN production is still unclear. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether neutrophils are involved in IFN-\u03b2 production after L. monocytogenes infection. To answer this question, we depleted granulocytes 24 hours prior infection after carefully titrating the antibody. Depletion of neutrophils was close to complete (Fig. 7A), while changes in other cell populations were negligible (Figure S3). Ex vivo analysis of luciferase activity in IFN-\u03b2+/\u0394\u03b2-luc mice depleted of neutrophils revealed, that these cells did not have a significant impact on luciferase expression (Fig. 7B). In addition, similar amounts of IFN-\u03b2 and total IFN-\u03b1 in serum were found in C57BL/6 mice despite of the neutrophil depletion (Fig. 7C). Hence, LysM-positive monocyte/macrophages are the population that is responsible to almost entirely produce type I IFN after Listeria monocytogenes infection.",

Since it was recently shown that CD11b+CD11cintLy6C+ cells previously defined as Tip-DCs are the major IFN-\u03b2 producers upon Listeria infection [29], we wanted to know whether Tip-DCs belong to LysM-expressing monocyte /macrophage population and whether we could confirm the production of IFN-\u03b2 by such cells. Therefore, we sorted CD11b+CD11c\u2212macrophages, CD11c+CD11b\u2212 dendritic cells (DCs), CD11b+CD11cintLy6C+ Tip-DCs and B220+CD11c\u2212 B cells as a negative control from IFN-\u03b2+/flox\u03b2-luc x LysMcre mice 24 hours after Listeria infection and tested for LysM, LysMcre as well as IFN-\u03b2 expression by RT-PCR. A strong signal was observed for LysM in Tip-DCs and macrophages and, to a lesser extent, in dendritic cells (Fig. 8). Cre recombinase was expressed in macrophages and in Tip-DCs, but not in DCs. IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was highly pronounced in Tip-DCs and weakly in DCs. Faint bands were also detectible for IFN-\u03b1 in these cells. In contrast, CD11b+CD11c\u2212 macrophages failed to produce any detectable amount of IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b1. Taking together, our results indicate that cells defined as Tip-DCs are within LysM-expressing cells and are responsible for the major IFN-\u03b2 production upon Listeria monocytogenes infection.",

            "text": "Macrophages have been identified as one of the target cell population in the murine spleen [26]. Besides, macrophages play a major role in the early innate defense against Listeria monocytogenes via secretion of different cytokines [20], [56]. However, DCs were also observed to be directly infected by L. monocytogenes\n[57]. Since IFN induction requires intracellular Listeria, we would have expected that DCs, in addition to monocytes/macrophages, would be involved in IFN-\u03b2 production. This is apparently not the case, because i) only negligible amounts of IFN-\u03b2 are produced in infected mice, in which IFN-\u03b2 is conditionally deleted by LysMcre. This also excludes a major contribution of a non-lymphoid tissue associated cell. ii) Similar amounts of reporter luciferase are produced in the global reporter mice and in the mice reporting production of IFN-\u03b2 by monocytes/macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes. Although LysMcre is supposed to be expressed by a small population of DCs [44], CD11ccre mice experiments confirm that conventional DCs do not significantly contribute to IFN-\u03b2 production. We also could exclude the contribution of pDC. The depletion of this cell population had no effect on the overall production of type I IFN. This extends the in vitro data of Stockinger et al. [28] to the in vivo situation. Finally, the involvement of neutrophils that are expressing LysMcre was also excluded by a depletion experiment.",

According to the recent publication of Dresing et al. [29], TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS producing Tip-DCs, that share markers with macrophages, were the main cellular source of IFN-\u03b2 in the course of Listeria infection. Our data showed that a LysM-expressing cell population is responsible for IFN-\u03b2 production in murine listeriosis. Testing sorted macrophages, DCs and Tip-DCs for type I IFN and LysM expression revealed that the LysM promoter was active in all three cell populations. However, only Tip-DCs were able to express vast amounts of IFN-\u03b2 in agreement with Dresing et al. [29]. Interestingly, such Tip-DCs showed strong expression of LysM. This sheds some doubts on the DC nature of Tip-DCs, which was originally defined by their T cell priming capacity in mixed lymphocyte reaction [29]. Thus, Tip-DCs might as well be defined as inflammatory monocytes.",
