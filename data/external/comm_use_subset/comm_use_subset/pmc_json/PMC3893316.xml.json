Although ACE2 is found in many tissues, it is highly expressed in the kidney, particularly within cells of the proximal tubule (PT) [3], [4]. Experimental studies suggest that ACE2 protects against renal disease progression. Thus, ACE2 gene knockout (KO) mice develop accelerated Ang II-mediated glomerulosclerosis [5] and are more susceptible to kidney injury in the type 1 diabetes Akita model [6]. Moreover, in Akita diabetic mice, administration of exogenous human recombinant ACE2 attenuates blood pressure and glomerular injury [7]. We recently reported that podocyte-specific overexpression of human ACE2 attenuates streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic nephropathy in mice [8]. In kidney biopsies from patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, glomerular and tubular expression of ACE2 is decreased, which may result in increased Ang II levels and subsequent enhanced renal injury [9]. In contrast, mice with diabetic nephropathy exhibit diminished glomerular ACE2 expression, but increased tubular ACE2, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to counteract the effects of increased Ang II [3], [10].",

ACE2 may be acted upon by metalloproteases, resulting in cleavage and extracellular shedding at its C-terminus from the cell surface [11]-[13]. Indeed, ectodomain shedding of soluble forms of ACE2 has been reported to occur in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and airway epithelial cells, mediated by the enzyme tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 convertase (TACE), also known as ADAM17 (a member of the \u201cA Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase\u201d family) [11]\u2013[13].",

            "text": "Soluble ACE2 was first reported in human urine by immunoblot in 2005 [14]. Urinary ACE2 levels increase in db/db diabetic mice and mice with STZ-diabetes, an effect that does not appear to be due to passage of the enzyme across the glomerular filtration barrier [15]. Furthermore, urinary ACE2 levels increase in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with diabetes [16], [17], and are closely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans [18]. In these studies, urinary ACE2 fragments have been detected of smaller molecular mass compared to full-length ACE2 [15]\u2013[18]. Recently Chodavarapu et al. demonstrated increased renal expression of ADAM17 in diabetic db/db mice, in association with increased urinary ACE2 excretion [19]. Treatment with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone decreased renal ADAM17 expression and urinary ACE2 levels [19]. Accordingly, these data suggest that ACE2 may be shed from tubular cells into the urinary space, a process that may be enhanced in diabetes via activation of ADAM17. In this regard, PT cells represent a potential source for urinary ACE2. However, the effects of high extracellular glucose or Ang II on PT ACE2 shedding, and the role of ADAM17 in these cells have not been explored. Furthermore, ACE2 fragments shed from PT cells have not been characterized with regards to possible cleavage sites within ACE2.",

Briefly, kidneys were harvested aseptically from anesthetized mice, and renal cortices were dissected, gently minced, and suspended in a perfusion solution consisting of (in mM) 105 NaCl, 24 NaHCO3, 5.0 KCl, 2.0 Na2HPO4, 1.0 MgSO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 4.0 Na lactate, 5.0 D-glucose, 1.0 L-alanine, 10 N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% collagenase (type V; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 0.05% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), pH 7.2. The suspension was gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After collagenase digestion, the cortical suspension was strained through a 250 \u00b5m brass sieve and centrifuged at 1500 g for 1 min.

The solution was centrifuged at 18500 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, and the digested tissue separated into four distinct bands. The fourth band (F4), enriched in PT segments, was aspirated, suspended in culture medium and centrifuged to remove the Percoll solution.

Cell media was collected, followed by addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail (1% vol/vol) (Sigma, P8340). For all experiments, media was first centrifuged at 9300 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to remove dead cells and cellular debris. The cell membrane fraction from PT cells was isolated as previously described [8]. Cell media (15 \u00b5L) or membrane fractions (1-2 \u00b5g) were then added to the wells of a 96-well plate (total volume 100 \u00b5L/well) in a solution containing 37.5 mM MES, 225 mM NaCl, 7.5 \u00b5M ZnCl2, 0.75 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 0.75 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 11.25 \u00b5M ACE2 substrate, with or without 1 \u00b5M of the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (GL1001, provided by Ore Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA). In this assay, MLN-4760 consistently caused at least 95% inhibition of ACE2 activity in conditioned media samples (see Table S1). Samples were protected from light and incubated for 16 hrs on a plate shaker at room temperature and fluorescence was measured using the FLUOstar Galaxy fluorometer (BMG Labtech, Durham, NC, USA) with excitation wavelength of 320 nM and emission wavelength of 405 nM. Preliminary experiments determined that for time points up to 16 hrs of incubation with ACE2 fluorogenic substrate, the linear range of detection for mouse recombinant ACE2 was between 1.56\u201350 ng/ml (R2 = 0.9976, p<0.001). Further experiments determined that using this assay, ACE2 activity in media samples from primary cultures of mouse PT cells was linear for at least 24 hrs of incubation with the fluorogenic substrate (Figure S1), and therefore 16 hrs of incubation was chosen for data collection. ACE2 activity was determined by subtracting the Relative Fluorescence Unit (RFU) obtained in the presence of MLN-4760 from the reading in the absence of inhibitor. ACE2 activity in the culture medium was corrected for the cell protein amounts on the culture dishes, and is reported as RFUs per \u00b5g protein per hour (RFU/\u00b5g/hr).",

The C-terminus Met706 detected in the \u223c75 kDa fragment represents a site of non-tryptic cleavage, and is a candidate site for ectodomain cleavage of ACE2. LC-MS/MS analysis of the immunoprecipitated \u223c75 kDa fragment from 3 additional separate experiments revealed ACE2 peptides with the C-terminus as Arg705, a tryptic cleavage site.",

The C-terminal amino acid was Arg577, corresponding to a tryptic cleavage site. The cleavage site for this ACE2 fragment is therefore predicted to be located at or C-terminal to Arg577 and could occur before Lys596, the next C-terminal tryptic cleavage site. In 1 of 6 experiments, LC-MS/MS analysis detected a C-terminal Lys619 (a tryptic cleavage site), corresponding to an ACE2 fragment with predicted molecular mass of 69.6 kDa. For this fragment, the cleavage site could lie between Lys619 and Arg644, since Arg644 is the next C-terminal site accessible to tryptic digestion. Alternative proteases (chymotrypsin and glutamyl endopeptidase) were used, but peptides representing the region of interest between Arg577 and Lys596 were not identified with this strategy (data not shown). A summary of the sequence data for the 2 main ACE2 shed fragments (deglycosylated 75 kDa and 60 kDa fragments) identified by LC-MS/MS is shown in Figure 6.",

Cell surface abundance of transmembrane proteins may decrease as a result of ectodomain shedding, which may be mediated by proteolytic cleavage at specific amino acid sites. Constitutive ectodomain shedding of soluble ACE2 has been demonstrated in a variety of cultured cells, including ACE2-transfected HEK293 cells and endogenous ACE2-expressing Huh7 cells [11], human airway epithelial cells [13], ACE2-transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells [12] and mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with adenovirus encoding ACE2 [12]. We observed a time-dependent increase in ACE2 activity in the media of unstimulated mouse PT cells, associated with the appearance of two ACE2 fragments on immunoblots.

Lambert et al. first reported that ADAM17 mediated the proteolytic cleavage of human ACE2 in HEK293 and endogenous ACE2 in Huh7 cells, with release of 2 soluble glycosylated fragments of size 105 kDa and 95 kDa [11]. Phorbol ester-stimulated release of ACE2 was blocked by inhibition of ADAM17 with TAPI-1, and by generalized metalloprotease inhibition with the hydroxymate-based inhibitor GM6001 [11]. TAPI-1 has also been shown to significantly inhibit phorbol ester-stimulated ACE2 shedding in ACE2-transfected CHO cells, with little effect on constitutive shedding [28]. In ACE2-transfected HEK293 cells, basal shedding of ACE2 was not significantly affected by either TAPI-1 or GM6001 [11]. By contrast, constitutive shedding of soluble ACE2 in human airway epithelial cells is reduced by ADAM17 inhibition, as is phorbol ester-stimulated release, suggesting a prominent role for ADAM17 in ACE2 cleavage in these cells [13]. Interestingly, in our studies TAPI-1 completely blocked high glucose-stimulated shedding of ACE2 from PT cells, and caused a partial inhibition of Ang II-stimulated ACE2 shedding. TAPI-1 had no effect on constitutive ACE2 release. The ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-2 also inhibited high glucose-stimulated ACE2 shedding from PT cells. In contrast, generalized metalloproteinase inhibition with GM6001 had no impact on constitutive ACE2 shedding, and did not significantly inhibit high glucose-stimulated shedding. Our data therefore suggest that basal ACE2 shedding in PT cells is mediated by other protease(s), or by a relative lack of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [11]. Indeed, since the inhibitors used in this study are not highly selective, our data support a possible role for ADAMs and metalloproteinases in the shedding of ACE2 from PT cells.",

ACE2 fragments were identified beginning at Gln18, consistent with the presence of a 17-amino acid signal peptide sequence at the N-terminus [2]. In unstimulated cells, the long soluble fragment was shown to contain a Met706 at the C-terminal position (not subject to tryptic digestion). This site was found in one experiment, while 3 other, separate samples identified a trypsin-sensitive Arg705 at the C-terminus. Similarly, in stimulated cells, the C-terminal amino acid of the long fragment was identified as Arg705 in 3 separate experiments. Using a series of synthesized peptides corresponding to the extracellular juxtamembrane region of human ACE2, Lai et al. reported that Arg708 and Arg710 may play roles in site recognition for ACE2 shedding mediated by ADAM17 [28]. A putative cleavage site for ADAM17-mediated shedding was identified at the bond Arg708-Ser709 in human ACE2 [28]. While the mouse ACE2 amino acid sequence contains conserved residues at Arg708 and Arg710, Arg708 is followed by Gly709, suggesting that species-specific cleavage sites may exist. In this regard, further studies directed at LC-MS/MS analysis of ACE2 fragments in media from ACE2 KO cells stably transfected with the human ACE2 cDNA vector could provide supportive information. Our data support Met706 as a potential cleavage site, although we cannot rule out the possibility for other cleavage sites in proximity (including Arg705), since these would generate fragments that might not be distinguishable on gel electrophoresis.",

Since this represents a trypsin-sensitive cleavage site, it is possible that the ACE2 cleavage site for this fragment may be downstream of Arg577, perhaps at a position up to Lys596, the next tryptic cleavage site. ADAM17 has some selectivity for aliphatic hydrophobic residues at the P1\u2032 position (immediately downstream of the cleavage site), and the P1\u2032 amino acid for Arg577 is Asn578 (a hydrophilic residue), although considerable variability exists in substrate recognition sites [29].

            "text": "The biologic relevance of ACE2 shedding from PT cells is unknown. Mice with diabetes exhibit increased kidney expression of ADAM17 and ACE2, associated with high levels of urinary ACE2 activity and shedding of ACE2 fragments [15], [19]. In humans, increased urinary ACE2 levels are associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, and are predictive of microalbuminuria, suggesting that urinary ACE2 may be a biomarker of early diabetic nephropathy [18]. Consistent with these observations, in our studies high glucose stimulated PT cell ADAM17 activity, and led to increased ACE2 shedding. By contrast, Ang II did not significantly increase ADAM17 activity, although TAPI-1 partly inhibited Ang II-stimulated ACE2 shedding. In this regard, the effect of Ang II on ACE2 shedding was relatively minor, and any increases in ADAM17 activity induced by Ang II may have been below the limits of detectability in the enzyme assay. Taken together, our results suggest that increases in luminal ACE2 activity occur in the diabetic kidney, stimulated by high glucose and Ang II. Shed ACE2 could serve to dampen levels of Ang II in the PT lumen, and increase Ang-(1-7) production. On the other hand, ectodomain shedding of ACE has been shown to occur in polarized renal epithelial cells [14], and N-domain ACE fragments are present in human urine and may associate with hypertension [30]. Although we did not study PT ACE shedding, it is intriguing to speculate that the relative balance between shed ACE2 and ACE fragments could regulate local levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in the urinary space.",
