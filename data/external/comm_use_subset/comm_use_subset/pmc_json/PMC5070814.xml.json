Transcriptomic changes, including those of non-coding transcripts, could provide a genome scale insight into host-pathogen interactions.

Generally, they are classified by their location relative to their neighboring protein-coding genes and include the long intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA), intronic lncRNA, antisense lncRNA and enhancer RNA [10]. Although a number of mammalian lncRNAs have been characterized and identified in the last few years, genome-wide identification of this class of ncRNAs has only recently become possible with the arrival of deep sequencing technologies. An expanding body of evidence reveals that lncRNAs, once described as dark matter, are involved in many biological processes such as genomic imprinting and cell differentiation [11]. They also play important roles in epigenetic and non-epigenetic based gene regulation [12]. Relatively, little is known about their involvement in activation and differentiation of immune cells, but new discoveries have revealed the involvement of lncRNA in defense systems [13]. Previous works have also outlined their quick responses to different stimuli and stress factors [14\u201317]. In addition, it has been shown that some lncRNAs enhance virus replication or decrease antiviral immunity [18].",

In case of extensive base-pairing of lncRNA with target mRNA, translation can be stabilized, while partial base-pairing may accelerate mRNA decay or inhibit translation of the target mRNA [21]. It has been shown that some lncRNAs interact with other small ncRNAs such as miRNAs. For example, in silkworm, 69 lncRNAs originating from 33 gene loci, may serve as miRNA precursors, and 104 lncRNAs may function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) [22]. LncRNAs are also targeted by miRNAs similar to mRNAs and reduce their stability. They may also act as sponge or decoy of miRNAs, and compete with miRNAs for binding to mutual target mRNAs [21].",

We recently found that a number of lncRNAs in Plutella xylostella, a pest of cruciferous plants, were linked to the insect\u2019s resistance to insecticides and might be involved in detoxification processes [14]. Jenkins et al (2015) identified 2,949 lncRNAs in the malaria mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae, using RNA-Seq data [25]. They showed that in various Anopheles species, lncRNAs have considerably lower sequence conservation as compared with protein-coding genes. In another study, it has been shown that 43% of total midgut transcripts of An. gambiae are lncRNAs and 32% of them showed some level of homology to other species [26].",

New transcripts were identified by large gap mapping of 1,148,814,115 reads of 35 RNA-Seq libraries to the genomic reference (AaegL3.3). We implemented strict mapping criteria (mismatch, insertion and deletion costs: 2: 3: 3 respectively). The minimum similarity and length fraction of 0.9 between a mapped segment and the reference were allowed as part of the mapping criteria. The large gap mapper algorithm also requires each mapped segment to include at least 10% of the read with minimum length of 17 bases. We considered a gap with maximum of 50 Kbp distance between mapped read segments to span the introns from RNA-Seq data. The annotations were generated by inspecting mapping of reads and identifying likely regions corresponding to genes, including their exons and splice sites. The algorithm scans each gap in the read mapping to explore whether the gap is assigned to a valid splice site or can be relocated to a valid splice site without cost.",

We identified 75,069 potential genes using the CLC Genomic Workbench transcript discovery algorithm. The genes that were annotated as known Ae. aegypti protein-coding genes were discarded and 30,865 potential genes were also checked for any exon or intron overlap with other known Ae. aegypti protein-coding genes. We selected 22,079 sequences, which were located more than 1kb away from any other known transcripts, for finding putative open reading frames (ORF). All possible six frames were produced for all selected sequences and then the translated sequences were subjected to a domain search to identify any putative conserved protein domains through Pfam v27.0 database [33]. We discarded 8,795 sequences with potential ORF above 100 aa or conserved protein domains. The remaining sequences were submitted to a coding potential assessment tool (CPAT), which utilizes a logistic regression model made with four sequence features: ORF size, ORF coverage, Fickett TESTCODE statistics and hexamer usage bias [34]. We applied the coding probability threshold of 0.3, which led to discarding 376 sequences as putative coding RNAs. We also implemented an expression threshold on our data to strengthen the identification pipeline. Sequences with more than 10 mappable reads in at least 17 out of 35 RNA-Seq libraries were considered as valid sequences and were kept for the next step. Any possible similarity with other known proteins was found by using BLASTx algorithm against nr and Swiss port database (E-value cut off 10\u22125). Finally, 3,842 potential lincRNAs were identified and used for further analysis.",

The relative expression of lincRNA candidates were examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) upon DENV-2 infection in Aa20 mosquito cells. Only significantly overexpressed lincRNAs after DENV-2 infection are represented in Fig 5. Although we used Aa20 cells for the lincRNA expression assays, the expression patterns of almost all the examined lincRNAs (5 out of 6) were consistent with the RNA-Seq data (adult mosquito carcass sample). We used a poly-dT primer to produce cDNA, which also confirmed that all of those identified transcripts have poly-A tails and therefore are true transcripts. Based on these results, significant increase in the transcription levels of a selected number of Ae. aegypti lincRNAs suggests their possible involvement in host-pathogen interaction but further investigations are required to confirm their roles in antiviral/immune responses.",

This gram-negative bacterium is transmitted maternally and potentially infects more than 40% of all insect species, manipulating its hosts using different strategies [44,45]. A fascinating aspect of Wolbachia infection is limiting replication of vector-borne pathogens in mosquitoes [45,46]. However, the mechanism(s) behind virus blocking is largely unknown. Here, we found that the transcript levels of several lincRNA genes significantly increased in Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes (Fig 6), which may lead to differential regulation of cellular protein-coding genes. Our previous studies showed that Wolbachia could manipulate host small ncRNAs such as miRNAs and piRNAs [47]. An overall induction of small ncRNAs between 18 and 28 nucleotides was also observed in Ae. aegypti cell line infected with wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia [48]. It was assumed that the upregulation of small ncRNAs in infected cells may result in an enhanced immune response and activated RNAi pathway. However, the role of these modifications in the host lincRNA gene expression profile, and potentially in anti-viral responses, is unknown and may lead to the discovery of lincRNAs that could be utilized for inhibition of virus replication in mosquitoes.",

In another study, differential expression of approximately 500 annotated mouse lncRNAs was reported during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [50]. Recently, it has been shown that honeybee lincRNAs are also differentially expressed during infection with various viruses such as sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), but the biological significance of these lincRNAs is completely unknown [51]. Although exploring the in vivo functions of immune-related lincRNAs is one exciting area for future studies, the differential expression of some lincRNAs could simply be byproducts of mRNA biogenesis or changes in global transcriptional profile due to microbial challenges [52,53]. Struhl (2007) believed that the transcriptional machinery is not perfect producing RNAs that serve no purpose or have no significant role in infection [54]. On the other hand, there are several examples which have shown that lincRNAs could be potentially important factors in host antimicrobial responses, and may represent a new class of signaling molecules involved in innate immunity or provide a new layer in gene regulation. For instance, two interferon (INF) induced lncRNAs, which were upregulated by influenza and vesicular stomatitis viruses, regulate the expression of the antiviral factor tetherin in human HuH7 cells [55].",

When NEAT1 was silenced, virus production was enhanced by increasing the nucleus-to-cytoplasm export of HIV-1 transcripts containing Rev-dependent instability element [57].

For instance, more than four recognition sites were predicted for miR-278-5p and miR-252-3p on lincRNA_1317. We also identified some hot spots for miRNA recognition sites on lincRNA_1317, which may allow multiple miRNAs to bind to the same regions (S2 Fig). miRNAs can reduce lincRNA stability by targeting their transcripts similar to mRNAs. Also, lincRNAs with multiple recognition sites may actually be competitive inhibitors of miRNA function and stopping them from binding to their genuine targets by sequestering them [21].
