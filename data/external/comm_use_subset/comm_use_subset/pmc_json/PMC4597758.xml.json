Primary clinical symptoms of the PEDV infection include acute diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and dehydration [4, 5]. Moreover, an increased mortality as well as higher morbidity in suckling piglets vs. older ones has also been reported as to the damage of PEDV infection [6]. Many attempts have been made to find effective prophylactic or therapeutic agents against PEDV infection, but no satisfactory agent has been reported to date [7, 8].",

Moreover, Taraxacum mongolicum, Viola yedoensis Makino, Rhizoma coptidis, and Radix isatidis, which have been selected for the present study, are also known to have antimicrobial and antiviral properties [15]. Taraxacum mongolicum has anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, anti-allergic and anti-viral properties [16\u201318] whereas extracts of Viola yedoensis Makino have antiviral and antibacterial activities against HSV-1 and Bacillus subtilis [19, 20]. Rhizoma coptidis, which contains berberine as one of its active components, has a potent antiviral activity against herpes virus as well as an antibacterial activity [21, 22]. Radix isatidis, roots and leaves of which have been used in traditional Eastern medicine for centuries to treat upper respiratory infections and encephalitis, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory [23] and antiviral effects against hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, and epidemic encephalitis [24] as well as a stimulatory action on macrophage phagocytosis [25].",

The MYCI reagent used in the present study was prepared by mixing powdered extracts of Taraxaci mongolia, Viola yedoensis Makino, Rhizoma coptidis and Radix isatidis (Mayway Co., USA) at a ratio of 1:1:1:2. Twenty-two 3-day-old cross-bred [(Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire) \u00d7 Duroc] suckling piglets were obtained from a commercial farm that had not implemented PEDV vaccination. The piglets were housed individually and randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with respect to a PEDV challenge and administration of the MYCI mixture. The animals received an oral administration of 3 \u00d7 103.5 TCID50 of PEDV in 3 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS only following 12-h fasting and daily administration of 60 mg of the MYCI mixture suspended in 1 mL of milk replacer (CJ Feed, Inc., Seoul) or the vehicle for 7 days. Calculated chemical composition of the milk replacer is presented in Table 1. All animals had a free access to water and the milk replacer throughout the experiment. Feces was obtained directly from the rectum of each piglet at 12 and 24 h and daily after d 1 post-challenge. Fecal consistency was scored according to a 4-ladder scale as described previously [26]: 0, firm feces; 1, soft feces; 2, mild diarrhea; 3, severe diarrhea. All animals were killed by electric stunning upon termination of the feeding trial, and the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were dissected also as described [26].",

Because the efficacy of PEDV vaccines is not good enough to prevent PEDV infection, it has been a research focus to search for safe, inexpensive and effective measures to prevent or treat PED. Accordingly, a variety of studies including the present one have been conducted in Europe, Asia, and America to find antiviral agents in medicinal herbs as a means of alternative medicine [6, 28].",

Likewise, active antiviral phytochemicals, i.e. 11\u03b2,13-dihydrotaraxinic acid, 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, berberine, and indirubin, have been identified in Taraxaumi mongolicum [33], 6,7- Viola yedoensis Makino [34], Rhizoma coptidis [21], and Radix isatidis [35], respectively, extracts of which were used in the present study.
