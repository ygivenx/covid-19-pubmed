Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the development of DNA vaccines as an effective immunogenic strategy to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA vaccines are considered to be inexpensive, stable, relatively safe compared to attenuated viral vaccines [1], [2], [3], [4] and flexible to integrate genes encoding antigens and immunostimulatory sequences. Thus, DNA vaccines are in favor of worldwide transportation and vaccination. Though intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination is still widely used, unfortunately, it usually failed in inducing local immunity at mucosal sites where tremendous infectious agents enter the body [5]. Interestingly, nasal mucosa is an attractive site for DNA vaccines to evoke both systemic and mucosal immune response [6], [7], [8], [9], due to its accessibility, lower enzyme distribution compared to the oral route and dense population of immune cells, often referred to as the nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT).",

In previous studies [10], the DNA vaccine pGJA-P/VAX against dental caries has been successfully constructed by encoding a GLU domain of GTF enzymes along with the A and P regions of surface protein antigen (PAc) of S. mutans. The pGJA-P/VAX can induce specific saliva SIgA response and serum IgG response via i.n. or i.m. immunization in animals, including adult mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the increase of the specific saliva SIgA is found to be correlated with reduction of dental caries [13], [14]. However, without adjuvants or delivery system, the single DNA vaccine (pGJA-P/VAX included) displayed low efficacy via i.n. administration [15], [16], possibly attributed to poor antigen delivery, as a result of various physiological hurdles, including mucociliary clearance, enzyme degradation and poor internalization by antigen presenting cells (APCs).",

Chitosan (CS) NPs are of special interest in nasal DNA vaccine delivery because of its unique properties, including bioadhesiveness, effectiveness in transport of antigens by transiently opening tight junctions of cells, biocompatibility and low toxicity [17], [18]. More evidences have shown that DNA vaccine complexed with the CS significantly improved mucosal sIgA levels via i.n. administration [19], [20]. As a DNA vaccine delivery system, the CS NPs are expected to increase the uptake and expression efficiency of the DNA vaccine in target cells. However, as compared to other non-viral carriers, the CS NPs mediated transfection efficiency is still relatively low [21], [22]. It has been suggested that the strength of electrostatic interactions between CS and DNA prevents their dissociation within cells, thus precluding transcription of DNA and resulting in low transfection [23].",

It has been reported that a core-shell nanoparticle system comprised of an anionic PLGA core and a glycol CS/DNA shell surface has been shown for enabling intracellular release of the loaded DNA via a pH-mediated manner, so as to facilitate DNA vaccine transfection in target cells [25]. Anionic lipids, the natural component of eukaryotic cell membranes, have been shown to significantly increase the gene transfection efficiency in cell lines, even better than commercial cationic liposomes [26]. In addition to powerful membrane fusion ability, the anionic liposomes exhibit more advantages compared with the cationic liposomes, especially in cytotoxicity. It has been reported that cationic liposomes are extremely toxic to phagocytic cells, and thus should be used with caution in vivo\n[27], [28]. Interestingly, mucosal immunization with liposomes seems to be limited and especially dependent on co-administration of other co-stimulants, which is caused by the modulation interaction of liposomes with mucosa and the instability of liposomes under physiological conditions [29]. These results inspired us whether a new system comprised of the AL and CS/DNA could render the transfection efficiency, and further improve the mucosal immunity of DNA vaccine. To our knowledge, very little has been focused on the combined use of bioadhesive CS with AL in nasal DNA vaccine delivery.",

As shown in Fig. 5B, the AL/FITC-CS/DNA was found to penetrate into the deep mucosa layer (up to 17.6 \u00b5m) within 2 h. The fluorescence intensity increased to the peak value in the depth of 8.8 \u00b5m and lasted to the depth of 13.6 \u00b5m, then decreased gradually in the deeper depth. The images of the sections (x, z and y, z) taken in the depth of 8.8 \u00b5m inside the mucosa were also shown below. It clearly showed that the AL/FITC-CS/DNA were internalized into mucosal epithelia and transported into deeper regions of mucosal area. However, as shown in Fig. 5A, less FITC-CS/DNA was found to penetrate into the mucosa layer. The three dimensional reconstruction animations from CLMS results were shown in Movie S1 and Movie S2.

When formulations were prepared in water at pH 5.5, the ionized CS, DNA and DOPG can form ternary complexes (AL/CS/DNA) by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged amino groups on CS and the negatively charged phosphate groups on DNA and DOPG. TEM results revealed that the AL/CS/DNA had a relatively spherical shape and an AL core at pH 6.4 (Fig. 3C). Theoretically, when CS, DNA and AL are mixed together, two domains (CS/DNA and CS/AL) are formed because of electrostatic interactions. Thus, it is more likely that the DNA, AL and CS separately yielded two types of domains (CS/DNA and CS/AL), which were bridged by CS chains in the AL/CS/DNA NPs (Fig. S2). Similar two-domain structure has been reported by incorporation of poly(g-glutamic acid) in CS/DNA complex [24]. The AL/CS/DNA had a micron scale size and negative zeta potential when pH increased to 7.4 from 6.4 (Fig. 3A). In this process, most CS amine groups were deprotonated and CS became hydrophobic. As the electrostatic interactions were no longer significant, hydrogen bonding might be the driving force for CS/DNA binding and CS/AL binding. As both CS/DNA and CS/AL carried negative charges, the electrostatic repulsion between the two resulted in disintegration of the AL/CS/DNA structure and favored the release of loaded DNA. This might explain why the DNA release from the AL/CS/DNA was pH-dependent (Fig. 3F). In contrast to AL/CS/DNA, it was reported that the binding of CS and DNA was even tighter for CS/DNA complexes when pH increased to physiological environment and CS/DNA complexes were not disrupted [38].",

It is reported that the nuclear translocation and gene expression are not achieved unless DNA is released from complexes once inside cells [39]. Another reason might be responsible for the high tranfection efficiency of the AL/CS/DNA. DOPE (one component of AL) were reported to promote membrane destabilization and suggested to facilitate gene transfection [40]. The PG lipids were proved to have nucleus-fusogenic ability [41], which might facilitate the nuclear translocation of DNA. In addition, the nasal mucosal pH is approximately 5.5\u20136.5 [42], which is in favor of stabilizing the AL/CS/DNA without DNA release before internalization. Excitingly, enhanced gene expression in nasal mucosa was observed (Fig. S3), which implied that the AL/CS/DNA might be more powerful than CS/DNA when used for nasal mucosa vaccination.

            "text": "Interestingly, the AL/CS/DNA showed longer nasal residence time compared with the CS/DNA (Fig. 4A and 4B). It has been verified that prolonging antigen retention in nasal cavity is especially important for enhancing mucosal immunity [43]. Both the AL/CS/DNA and CS/DNA had more powerful bioadhesive ability compared with naked DNA, while the difference between the two NPs was not obvious enough (\u223c1.3 fold, Fig. 4C). The positive charged CS chains could provide strong bioadhesion with the negative charged mucosal surface like other cationic complexes [44]. Similarly, no significant difference in opening the cell tight conjunctions was observed between the two NPs (Fig. 6A). It can be explained that CS and its derivatives are considered to be able to transiently open the tight junctions between cells [45], [46], [47]. Surprisingly, enhanced intracellular uptake was verified on the AL/CS/DNA than that of the CS/DNA (Fig. 6B). Physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, shape, molecular weight and composition play a key role in the cellular uptake of NPs [48]. DOPE lipid has a packing parameter value >1 and is known to adopt an inverted hexagonal structure that favors membrane destabilization for enhanced intracellular uptake. On the other hand, it is reported that globular GC (glyco chitosan) NPs showed an enhanced distribution in cells compared with the irregular GC polymers [49]. Powerful mucosal permeability and enhanced intracellular uptake results explained why more AL/CS/DNA was delivered into mucosal cells (Fig. 5B) resulting in prolonged nasal residence time, while the CS/DNA was gradually removed by mucociliary clearance. Another reason might be taken into consideration. It can be inferred that the spherical AL/CS/DNA can penetrate the mucus gels through the pores between mucin fibers to contact mucosal epithelia. However, the network shaped CS/DNA might be trapped in the luminal mucus layer because of its steric hindrance. Finally, it was gradually removed by mucociliary clearance. More details about the exact mechanism need to be explored.",

As we expected, the AL/CS/DNA was more powerful in inducing specific mucosal and systemic responses compared with the traditional used CS/DNA system. The advantage of increased saliva anti-PAc SIgA production is obvious, which aggregates the unattached S. mutans and interferes with both S. mutans pathogenesis and colonization on the tooth surfaces. Naked DNA without delivery system via i.n. was challenged by ciliary clearance, nuclease degradation and difficulties in uptake and expression, making it unefficient in inducing mucosal and systemic immune responses. It has been indicated by several reports that, in contrast to soluble antigens, particulates could be preferentially taken up by M cells following nasal administration [50]. Noticing the relatively less populations of M cells in NALT [51] and the notorious difficulty in transfection of the APCs with non-viral vectors [52], we considered that a non M cells or APCs target strategy might be also effective in nasal mucosal immune. In fact, it has been reported that a new pathway of polymer-based DNA vaccine delivery via bystander cells without direct targeting of APCs is successful [53]. In addition, anti-PAc SIgA production in vaginal wash was evaluated (Fig. S4). The result confirmed that the AL/CS/DNA can induce a distal mucosal immune response which is agreed with most studies, because the stimulated lymphocytes in NALT can distribute to other mucosal sites such as vagina. This result also confirmed the advantage of incorporating AL.",
