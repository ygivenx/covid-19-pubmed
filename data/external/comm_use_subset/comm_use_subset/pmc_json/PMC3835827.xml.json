            "text": "On 31 March 2013, three died urban residents from eastern China were reported to be infected with a novel avian-origin influenza A virus [1]. Sequencing analyses revealed that hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of this emerging reassortant virus belonged to H7 and N9 subtypes of influenza A virus respectively, while six internal genes were closely related to those of avian H9N2 viruses [1]. An increasing number of patients infected with H7N9 virus subsequently occurred in many provinces of China. As of 30 May 2013, a total of 132 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus have been reported, 37 of whom have died [2]. The novel virus infection is associated with severe clinical symptoms characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure [1], [3], [4]. Since H7N9 virus has not been detected previously in human beings or animals, the possible source of infections and the reservoirs of this virus remain unclear. Moreover, sporadic human infections with H7N9 virus to date raise more important questions that whether this virus will persistently evolve for better adaption to humans, and whether limit or even sustained human-to-human transmissions will occur. Such questions induce global public health concerns.",

            "text": "For more effective prevention and control of H7N9 virus infection in humans, development of a rapid, sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic assay is urgently needed in many laboratories. Conventional virus isolation from cell lines is time-consuming and thus delays the detection efficiency. Because specific antibodies in response to virus infection are generally produced at about 3\u223c4 weeks in the bodies of infected patients, monoclonal antibody-based ELISA is not well suitable as an early diagnostic tool in the initial stage of the disease. In contrast, viral DNA or RNA from different clinical samples is an appropriate detection target during the acute phase of an infection or even before the onset of illness. Various detection methods targeting viral nucleic acids have been developed for the rapid identification of viral diseases, including conventional RT-PCR [5], real time RT-PCR [6], microarray examination [7], electrospray ionization mass spectrometry [8] and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [9], of which real-time RT-PCR has become the most popular molecular diagnostic approach in clinical laboratories owing to its simplicity, high sensitivity and specificity. Real-time RT-PCR assays are usually carried out with the use of hydrolysis probe (Taqman) or SYBR green fluorescence dye. Compared to the Taqman probe, SYBR green-based real time RT-PCR assay can achieve the same detection efficiency with lower costs and thus has been also widely applied in the detection of a variety of viruses [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].",

Although at this moment there is no potent evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, genetic analysis suggests that several amino acid changes in viral HA and PB2 RNA polymerase genes improve the ability to bind human-type receptors and facilitate the efficient replication in mammals [22], highlighting the great threat to human beings. Furthermore, the real sources of infection and the reservoirs of this novel virus are still uncertain despite the fact that one virus isolate has been acquired from a chicken [3]. Many other questions, such as modes of transmission, viral incubation period, the optimal clinical specimens for laboratory confirmation and the spectrum of clinical illness, remain to be further determined [23]. Therefore, a lot of measures must be taken to effectively prevent and control the outbreak of H7N9 virus infection, of which development of a rapid molecular diagnostic assay is the top priority in public health laboratories.",

Although the primers were designed based on the sequences from the initial three isolates, the H7 and N9 primer pairs used in this study are suitable for the detection of all of the new reassortant H7N9 virus stains available in the GISAID EpiFlu database by sequence alignment. Moreover, the introduction of mixed bases into primers could make it possible to detect other known circulating H7Nx and HxN9 influenza viruses. Since SYBR green dye can intercalate into non-specific DNA such as primer dimers [10], the results are usually analyzed in terms of amplification plots combined with melting curves to discriminate non-specific amplification. H7- and N9-specific amplicons in this assay had unique Tm values, significantly different from those of primer dimers to avoid false positive results. In-vitro transcribed viral RNA is very useful for eliminating the need for handling contagious virus isolates and has been preferentially applied in testing sensitivity of various virus diagnostic assays [11], [12], [14]. With the use of in-vitro RNA transcripts of HA and NA genes of H7N9 virus, the assay was found to detect H7 and N9 genes with a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction, similar to the Taqman probe-based assay presented by Corman et al [24]. The specificity of the assay was subsequently established through testing a panel of previously known influenza A virus subtypes as well as other human respiratory viruses. No specific amplification signals were observed in all of the reactions with the viruses above as the templates, indicating the high specificity of the assay. To evaluate the practical use of the SYBR green-based real time RT-PCR assay, we collected clinical samples from seven H7N9 infected patients during the acute stage of the disease. All of the samples were readily amplified in H7 and N9 examinations by this method, suggesting its effectiveness in clinical practice. Besides the diagnosis of clinically suspected samples, this developed real time RT-PCR assay has the potential in dynamic monitoring of viral replication based on series specimens from individual patient with H7N9 virus infection, thus guiding the therapeutic strategy in clinic. Large scale specimens need to be collected to further evaluate the diagnostic robustness of the assay.",

However, SYBR green-based RT-PCR assays are less influenced by mismatches because of probe independency.
