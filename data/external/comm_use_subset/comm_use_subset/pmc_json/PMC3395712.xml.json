The parasite has distinct developmental stages, such as the fast-replicating tachyzoites that are present in the acute phase of infection, while the slow-replicating bradyzoites form tissue cysts in muscular and nervous tissues during the chronic phase of infection [1]\u2013[2]. Infection usually takes place after accidental ingestion of raw or undercooked meat containing tissue cysts, oocyst-contaminated food or water, and by transplacental passage of tachyzoites in active infection during the gestational period [3]\u2013[4]. Congenital infection may lead to neurological disorders, ocular disease and/or fetal death [5]. T. gondii is also a major cause of infectious abortion and induces clinical disease in production animals, especially goat, sheep and swine, elevating production costs and resulting in considerable impact on the livestock industry as well as the public health [6].",

Antibodies were separated from other constituents of the egg yolk by the addition of acid water and later precipitated by salting-out (19% sodium sulfate) (Fig. 1A). Although enriched in IgY antibodies, the water soluble fraction (S1) still presented undesirable low molecular weight proteins after acid water precipitation of pooled egg yolk (Fig. 1B, lane S1) that were eliminated after salting-out step (Fig. 1B, lane P2), presenting an average protein concentration of 4 mg/mL. We recovered 115 eggs from four STAg-immunized chickens during a 49-day interval. Each egg presented an average of 12 mL of yolk and the mean yield was 48 mg of polyclonal antibody per egg. Precipitated antibodies contained in P2 fraction were further submitted to purification by exclusion-size chromatography (Fig. 1C), resulting in a protein peak between the 13th and 19th fractions, although elevated purity was detected mainly in the 14th fraction (F14), as it may be observed in its SDS-PAGE profile (Fig. 1D). Thus, the used protocol was able to retrieve a mean of 4 mg of total IgY from 1 ml of crude egg yolk. Slot-blot assays confirmed IgY in fractions from salting-out and gel filtration purified fractions until the concentration of 110 ng of protein (Fig. 1E).",

The production of IgY anti-STAg increased significantly along the next weeks, and developed a progressive and sustained response, reaching its peak on day 42 p.i. (Fig. 2A). High avidity of IgY anti-STAg antibodies was already observed in the first reactive samples, at 21 days p.i., as demonstrated by the lack of significant differences in EI values between 6 M urea-treated and untreated samples (Fig. 2B). The antigen recognition repertoire and avidity maturation of IgY anti-STAg were also verified by immunoblot. Similar to ELISA, reactivity was first observed on day 21 after immunization, with strong staining of a 30 kDa protein (Fig. 2C). From the 35th day onwards, IgY anti-STAg antibodies recognized a broad range of T. gondii antigens. The 6 M urea treatment presented a reduction in staining intensity of the described antigens between the 21st and 35th days p.i., with normal reactivity being observed after that period (Fig. 2C).",

These differences were maintained independently of the route used to immunize the mice (i.m. or s.c., Fig. 5A). In order to further observe those differences in recognition, we performed 2D-immunoblots (WB2D) using the polyclonal antibodies obtained from immunized hens and mice. The differences in recognition were clearly noted in WB2D assay, with IgY antibodies recognizing a sequence of five antigenic spots at \u223c40 kDa, however with distinct isoelectric points \u2013 from neutral to basic pH (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, mouse IgG reacted strongly to two acidic antigens at \u223c50 kDa (Fig. 5C), while IgY reacted faintly to the same spots and a basic protein with similar molecular weight (Fig. 5B). Such differences were also noted in the distinct recognition patterns in antigens with 60\u201380 kDa, as well as the absence of immunodominant p22 antigen by chicken IgY. Additionally, STAg immobilized in nitrocellulose strips were probed to anti-Neospora caninum e anti-Eimeria spp. IgY in order to check the specificity of the antibodies.

These anti-STAg antibodies were obtained from the egg yolk, in a protocol which animal bleeding turned out to be unnecessary [19]. Generally, yolk IgY arise around 7th to 10th day after the sera antibodies, in a sera concentration-dependent manner [20]. In addition, the large amounts of polyclonal antibodies recovered from the egg yolk in this process, the high avidity of the produced IgY antibodies, and their potential applications are itself the great features of the protocol herein described. Egg yolks contain large amounts of IgY passively transferred by hens, with mass ranging between 2\u20138 mg per mL after purification, and it has been estimated that 2\u201310% of total egg yolk antibodies are antigen-specific [21], [9]. To obtain STAg-specific IgY we used simple protocols, which are easily reproduced without the need of refined equipment or reagents. Additionally, installations required for IgY production are smaller and easier to handle than those designed for small ruminants, commonly used for large scale antisera production [22]. The production of specific IgY has been previously described for the recognition of a broad range of targets, including Plasmodium falciparum\n[23], hepatitis A virus [24] and tumor cells [25]\u2013[26].",

We demonstrated that STAg-immunized hens produced large amounts of high avidity polyclonal IgY anti-STAg antibodies after the first booster, with early recognition of p30 proteins. It is known that SAG1 protein (p30) triggers the human IgG maturation in latter stages of T. gondii infection [28]. Additionally, IgY antibodies recognized a broad range of proteins, with distinct isoelectric points determined by 2D-immunoblot. Previous studies have shown that serum samples from naturally infected humans react to a broad spectrum of T. gondii proteins [29] and experimentally infected mice produce specific antibodies against high and low molecular weight antigens of tachyzoites [30]. Consistently, our results demonstrated that IgY anti-STAg presented an antigen recognition profile similar to mouse serum, although some antigens were more immunogenic for hens than mice, probably due to the phylogenetic distance among these animals. In addition, IgY antibodies raised against closely related parasites did not recognize STAg proteins, which denotes an interesting feature of the IgY system, since cross-reactivity is a normal feature of mammalian IgG.",

As previously stated, this antibody producing system offers high yield of specific antibodies [32]. We believe that immunization of hens with selected T. gondii targets could improve the range of applications for IgY antibodies. For the P. falciparum model, it has been demonstrated that monospecific and polyclonal IgY antibodies were advantageous [10]. In that sense, immunizations using single antigens of T. gondii could be employed to better understand the role of the selected molecules, as tools to improve the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis [33] or the knowledge of host-parasite interaction mechanisms [34]. Additionally, the identification of conserved surface antigens among apicomplexan organisms is usually performed by mammal specific IgG antibodies and contributes to our understanding of parasite evolution [35]\u2013[37].",

Moreover, the role of T. gondii antigens involved in parasite virulence has been largely addressed over the last decade [40]\u2013[41]. The most common protocols used for that purpose are the incubation of the parasite with specific antisera or the generation of strains with targeted depletions, preventing molecular interactions between host and parasite proteins [16].",

Antigens with approximately (\u223c) 30 kDa (blue box) were evenly recognized by all antibodies tested, which was not observed in antigens with \u223c40 kDa (green box) and \u223c50 kDa (red box), which were mainly recognized by chicken and mouse antibodies, respectively. The same recognition pattern against STAg proteins was noted in two-dimensional immunoblotts (WB2D), probed with chicken IgY (B) or mouse IgG (C). (D) IgY antibodies obtained from eggs of chickens immunized with T. gondii, as well as IgY against Neospora caninum and Eimeria spp., were assayed against STAg-immobilized nitrocellulose membranes in order to check possible antibody cross-reactivity.",
