These viruses infect a wide range of avian and mammalian species, and are responsible for enteric or respiratory infections [3]. There is a rising concern about the emergence of two human coronaviruses, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), who emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively [4, 5]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have a zoonotic origin, revealing the importance of the control of coronaviruses associated with domestic animals in close contact with human populations [6].",

The total G + C genomic content and G + C content at first, second and third codon positions were calculated using the Codon W program and EMBOSS Cusp program (available at http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/cusp). The RSCU values of Bos taurus cells were obtained from Kazusa database (available at: http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). Codon usage preferences in BCoV in relation to the codon usage of Bos taurus were established by means of the use of the codon adaptation index (CAI) [23]. CAI was calculated using the approach of Puigbo et al. [24]. This method permits to compare a given codon usage (BCoV) to a predefined reference set (Bos taurus). In order to show whether the BCoV genes are well adapted to the codon usage of the reference set, as measured by CAI, we constructed a dataset composed of 22 Bos taurus genes selected at random and obtained from ARSA at DNA Database of Japan (available at: http:/http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/arsa). The RCSU values of those 22 Bos taurus genes were found to be similar to the RCSU values obtained from the Kazusa database (see Additional file 3). Moreover, a strong positive correlation are found among the RSCU of those genes and the RSCU obtained from Kazusa database by Spearmans\u2019rank correlation test [25] (r = 0.956, P < 0.00001).",

Then, we calculated the CAI values for all of them, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the e-CAI of these random sequences was performed in order to show if the generated sequences follow a normal distribution. The results of these studies revealed an e-CAI value of 0.656. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed a normal distribution of the generated sequences (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of e-CAI value of 0.028, which is below the critical value of 0.061). To avoid the effect of extreme compositional constraint and to make sure that CAI is directly correlated with codon usage preferences, Puigbo et al. [26] suggested that if the eCAI value of a gene is higher than its CAI value, it may be considered as evidence of codon usage adaptation.

Moreover, BCoV strain BCV-AKS-01, who shows a more distant genetic relation with C3 and C1 BCoVs enrolled in the studies (Additional file 5: Figure S1B), is situated in a different position in the plane defined by the first two axes of COA (Additional file 5: Figure S1A). The results of these studies revealed that evolutionary processes also influenced the codon usage pattern of BCoV.",

Interestingly, recent studies on human coronaviruses revealed significant biases in nucleotide composition [36]. While the A/G bias is a relatively stable property among coronaviruses, the C/U bias differs significantly in each virus type, with U-counts ranging from 30.7% (SARS-CoV) to 40.3% (HCoV-HKU) and C-counts from 20.3% (MERS-CoV) to 12.9% (HCoV-HKU) [36]. The U-count for BCoV revealed a value of 35.6%, while the C-count shows a value of 15.1%. This is in agreement with the results found in this work and may help to explain the bias found in BCoV genome composition and codon usage. Moreover, the CAI values for BCoV genes resulted to be significantly different from the ones obtained for B. taurus, revealing differences in codon usage preferences (Table 2).",

            "text": "The results of these studies revealed that the relative abundance of CpG and GpC dinucleotides showed a strong deviation from the expected frequencies (Table 3). The under-representation of CpG might be due to its immunostimulatory properties as recognition of unmethylated CpG by Toll like receptor 9 (TLR9), which leads to activation of several immune response pathways in the host [37]. Moreover, an increase in CpG dinucleotide frequency has been shown to lead to attenuation of replication in RNA viruses [38]. Cytosine deamination and selection against CpG motifs have been proposed as two independent selection forces that shape codon usage bias in coronaviruses [39], suggesting that immune selection may play a role in the observed BCoV codon usage bias. This is in agreement with the results of this work and indicates that the composition of dinucleotides also determines the variation in synonymous codon usage among BCoV.",
