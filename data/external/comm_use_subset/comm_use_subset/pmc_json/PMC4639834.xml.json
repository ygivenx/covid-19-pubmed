Although highly driven by what Robert Cox (1981) termed as problem solving, that is, driven by specific ways of tackling a (globalized) medical/epidemiological problem, the diplomatic camp is no longer a privilege of the traditional professional state diplomats representing government foreign affairs departments. The late 20th century witnessed the rising awareness of, and cluster of, new trans-border issues that transformed the practice of diplomacy in international relations. Furthermore, the state-centric focus proved to be limited in addressing such issues, opening the way to innovative normative and practical grounds redefining opportunities to think and practice health governance in \u201821st century diplomacy\u2019.",

Most notably, community-level action prompted the exigency of a national response for HIV/AIDS issue well before any official state-level response was initiated in Africa (The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS [UNAIDS], 1997).",

This is when an issue becomes \u2018sticky\u2019, with calls for more than ad hoc responses, in the order of long-term solutions with ample space for multiple actors, and institutional norms and regime complexes (Raustiala and Victor, 2004: 279). Sticky issues demonstrate that states do not have exclusive \u2018ownership\u2019 of an issue in the 21st century. Sticky issues have its own \u2018self\u2019, autonomous of how a country\u2019s foreign policy is shaped. It involves a multitude of actors in the process of its governance and diplomacy. In other words, an issue is the content of diplomacy; context is the event that animates the issues into life; and multitude actors are the agents that fragment global governance. What it implies is that certain issues due to their complex and ongoing nature serve as a catalyst for a focused, albeit at times divergent, set of global responses.",

As a result, issue-specific CSOs may be in direct conflict with traditional state authorities. Indeed the contrast in normative positions acts to \u2018push\u2019 state and non-state actors further away from each other (see Figure 1).

In terms of further analysis at the micro-level, the ideational affiliation of actors in international relations prior to their \u2018emergence\u2019 was \u2018there\u2019 but was not ontologically observable. Only when they became \u2018fleshed out\u2019 with missions, objectives, and modes of organizations did they effectively emerge as an actor.

Modern diplomacy is that \u2018pull\u2019 effect that builds partnership through negotiation, dialogues, and cooperation among a diversity of actors. The \u2018pull\u2019 effect in diplomacy, in effect, integrates fragmented international relations through a network of governance. As a result, the push\u2013pull effect creates an inverted-U effect of this 21st century diplomacy in an increasingly fragmented world (Figure 3). In terms of timing, the pull effect may be a matter of a few years in some cases or a few decades in others. The pull effect between actors may result in a weak or a strong connection depending on how successful the negotiation is. Sometimes other actors act as a catalyst in initiating that pull effect which is in effect dialogue and negotiation between the diverging actors. IGOs often play that role when the IGO leaders press for a resolution to address an issue among its member states.",

The diplomats are one of the many instrumental figures who are the \u2018go to\u2019 persons or the intermediaries and maintain those nodes. The nodes were predominantly among the states until the late 20th century in international relations. As such, states were the only powerful actors, diplomats were state-officials with traditional rules and customary conducts, diplomacy was \u2018club-like\u2019 with strong statecraft characteristics, and the nodal connections were mostly hierarchical. In the 21st century world, though, all nodes not necessarily direct toward states, rather they are poly-lateral; states are not the only powerful actors albeit still significant; diplomats are intermediaries who are not only state-officials; diplomacy is more than statecraft, with a mix of statecraft and society craft; and the nodal connections among the actors are more horizontal. The result is that \u2018club diplomacy\u2019 is supplemented by \u2018network diplomacy\u2019 (Heine, 2008: 272\u2013277), where the institutional form for non-state actor is more resilient, horizontal information and resource mobilization are fluid, and clusters of networks are firmly \u2018tied\u2019 (Burris, Drahos and Shearing, 2005: 38) to nodes that act as a focal point for sticky issues.",

            "text": "Indeed, the emergence of unofficial (non-state) diplomats was a significant product of the process of fragmentation. The classic work of Hedley Bull (1977) did, to be sure, point to this phenomenon in its definition of diplomats by opening the way for a much broader categorization such that diplomacy not only includes the conduct of official relations by states but \u2018other entities with standing in world politics\u2019 (p. 162). Yet, as argued elsewhere, it took the structural and systemic contradistinction between the fragmenting global governance and the traditional diplomacy (Cooper et al., 2008: 2) to accelerate and diversify this process. In essence, forces on the ground caught up to conceptual possibilities, with the emergence of unofficial diplomats willing and able to fill in that \u2018void\u2019 created by the inadequacies of traditional diplomacy based on statecraft, which indeed is the embedded \u2018pull\u2019 effect of the fragmented international relations. Writing how diplomacy is changing in the presence of multiple actors in polycentric governance, Scholte (2008: 55\u201359) has argued that in the 21st century diplomacy, representation covers many more actors, communication handles faster speeds and larger volumes from multiple technological tools, and negotiation addresses an increasing range of diverse political parties and identities.",

In part, this is due to both the perception and reality that regional organizations \u2013 or at least those in the global South \u2013 lacked problem-solving capacity. However, the gap is also a function of the contest between the problem-solving orientation of diplomacy at the apex of the global level and the dynamics at the regional level that highlight the need for the regional dimension as a driver for social redistribution and a set of expanded social regulations. Whereas the core of the problem-solving global diplomatic agenda has been heavily focused on pandemics, regional dynamics have concentrated on the extension of social rights. Indeed, even when there is an emphasis on lesson learning, the focus has often been on finding solutions involving equity (such as in the area of producing cheaper generic pharmaceuticals).",

NGOs and regional organizations are often at a disadvantage in terms of outreach and institutional capacity, as well as in terms of depth and experience in international law to effectively influence negotiation process in health-related issues (Taylor and Dhillon, 2011). For instance, health diplomacy is profoundly affected by legal considerations during negotiation process. Trade negotiations such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) include critical legal implications on generic drug production, public health services, price control of essential medicines, and market regulations. Indeed, the legal matters on trade affect multiple health negotiations simultaneously. During the negotiation on influenza virus sharing with Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, and a few other countries indicated that the interdisciplinary working group (IDWG), formed by the World Health Organization (WHO), could not debate the intellectual property rights (IPR) issues as the WHO member states were waiting for a report from another negotiation on IPR (Lange, 2011: 138\u2013139). Often changes in texts from \u2018should\u2019 to \u2018shall\u2019 stall last minute negotiations due to the legal implications associated with them, let alone the disagreements in legal niceties as evident from the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) negotiation (Bernard, 2012: 68).",

The Gates Foundation is not only a larger health donor than all governments, except for the United States and the United Kingdom (McCoy et al., 2009), but it is also a crucial participant in negotiations across a wide spectrum from the \u2018Health 8\u2019 coordinating group to its 1.5 billion dollar contribution to the G8\u2019s 2010 Muskoka Initiative on Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (Fidler, 2013: 701). Significantly, the regional dimension is coming into focus in this domain. For example, in a meeting between the African Development Bank President Donald Kaberuka and Bill Gates, co-chair and trustee of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, discussions were held on ways to cooperate on a range of issues from vaccine delivery to sanitation, to Ebola (African Development Bank Group, 2014). Constant efforts to improve epidemiological surveillance at the regional level are also evident from the earlier experience of the United States and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) helping setting up Polymerase Chain Reaction machines in Mexico for molecular diagnostics, signing a trilateral agreement of cooperation under the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, and more so after recent emerging disease outbreaks in Africa where a network of laboratories in Kenya and Ghana are key pillars of disease surveillance (Farooq and Majowicz, 2013: 40\u201341).",

The negotiation for the destruction of the Smallpox virus, which lasted from 1999 to 2007, illustrates the dynamic relations between the developed and developing countries and among the developing countries. When the world eradicated the Smallpox in the late 1970s, keeping the remaining stocks of the Variola virus appeared to be a security threat to global health. The developing countries from Africa and Asia with support from India, China, Iran, Cuba, and South Africa strongly opposed any delay in the destruction of the virus stockpile.",

However, China\u2019s shift in policy after SARS outbreak embracing greater openness and multilateral cooperation also points to its realization that security benefit is higher in cooperation than withholding information in fear of economic loss (Schwartz and Schwartz, 2010).

            "text": "Still in terms of practice, the expansion of regional organizations directly into health diplomacy has lagged behind other manifestations of diplomatic change. The Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM), for instance, has developed some guidelines for regional capacity for issues such as human resource capacity and communicative diseases (Yeates and Deacon, 2010) though Yeates (2010, 2014b) argues that there are tensions in the region between approaches that privilege the production of health workers for \u2018export\u2019 and those that favor regional self-sufficiency. It may be misleading to suggest that the disconnect between the declaratory and the operational necessarily stymies momentum for the regional dimension in health diplomacy. Rather, it signals forcefully the salience of the contest between two types of diplomacy: the problem-solving diplomacy at the core of the approach favored by the actors at the apex of the global system, and the normatively driven approach advocated by a number of regional actors in the global South. The developments in health diplomacy with respect to the regional dimension reveal the salience of this normative contribution. In light of this, Yeates (2014b: 3) argues that many of these regional social policies have progressed faster as exhortative declarations of aims and principles rather than as binding regulatory or redistributive mechanisms. However, it is important to note the symbolic and practical uses of exhortative policy (such as Social Charters and other declarations of intent) in creating greater awareness of a range of common issues and a world of possibilities on a wider front. Exhortative policy may not have \u2018teeth\u2019 but it is nonetheless vital in contributing to the forging of transnational political alliances and political dynamics that may in turn stimulate more substantive forms of regional cooperation and action (Yeates, 2014a).",
