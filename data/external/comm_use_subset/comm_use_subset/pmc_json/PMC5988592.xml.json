Innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, alveolar macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) play critical roles not only in the initial control of viral replication but also in the regulation of influenza virus-specific adaptive immunity [46]. The cytokines and chemokines produced by these cells are important defense against IAV infection preventing the replication and spread of the virus. However, the nonspecific innate immune response can be locally destructive if not appropriately contained [41]. Certain influenza viruses, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 strains, can trigger an overly inflammatory innate immune response, often called \u201ccytokine storm\u201d [47]. Therefore, the inflammatory response induced by the IAV infection functions as a double-edged sword, it is necessary to protect against viral infection but may also cause severe pulmonary injury.",

Our results showed that the early inflammatory cytokines, lung pathology, neutrophils infilitration, and the overall NK cell responses in the lungs of aged mice were significantly lower than the young mice on 3 dpi, which was consistent with the reduced bodyweight loss in the aged mice after PR8 infection. Therefore, the higher overall NK cell responses in the early infection may contribute to the enhanced lung pathology in the young mice. Further, NF-kB activation is a hallmark of inflammatory and antiviral responses mediated especially by type I interferons that block viral replication, however, previous studies showed that active NF-kB signaling is required for effective influenza virus infection [49-51]. Thus, the higher viral loads in the lungs of the young mice on 3dpi were in accord with the early activation of inflammation and lung injury. Although the early viral loads were high in the young mice, the virus were cleared rapidly with the effective and strong T cell responses, as most of the viruses were cleared on 10 dpi. On the other hand, in the aged mice, even though the viral load was lower on 3 dpi compared to the young mice, the viral clearance were prolonged because of the delayed and milder T cell responses. Of note, even the peak strength of CD4+ T cell responses were severely reduced in the aged mice (1.593\u00b10.5105 in the aged mice on 7 dpi compared to 6.446\u00b11.863 in the young mice on 7 dpi), the strength of peak CD8+ T cell responses in the aged mice (16 dpi) were at a similar level, albeit a little reduced, compared to that in the young mice on 7 dpi (17.30\u00b10.9212 in the aged mice on 16 dpi compared to 24.77\u00b12.117 in the young mice on 7 dpi). Therefore, the delayed and milder T cell responses in the aged mice were still capable to finally clear the virus, as the viral loads in the aged mice were mostly cleared on 15 dpi. On the other side, CD8+ T cells are partly responsible for the pathogenesis of acute pneumonia caused by influenza A virus [52]. Thus, the lower CD8+ T cell responses in the aged mice might have also contributed to the reduced lung lesions in the aged mice. However, many factors might influence the final outcome after IAV infection.",

Previous study reported that the number of neutrophils was relatively higher in the elderly, but the effector functions such as chemotaxis and intracellular killing were decreased. And the macrophages and DC cells also showed age-related changes, including the decreased cytotoxicity, intracellular killing and antigen presentation. These changes resulted in the impaired adaptive immune responses in the elderly [54, 55, 58]. In our research, the alveolar macrophages decreased in the lung of young mice on 3 dpi, which was consistent with a previous report that more than 90% of resident alveolar macrophages were deleted in the first week after influenza infection [39]. While the percentage of DC and neutrophils increased in the lungs of the young mice. However, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and DC cells remained largely unchanged in the lungs of the aged mice on 3 dpi.",

The strong immune response in the young mice resulted in faster clearance of IAV virus, but also caused severe lung injury, which led to higher mortality and pronounced bodyweight loss. While in the aged mice, the delayed and weaker immune responses were still capable to eventually clear the virus infection but with limited tissue damage. Therefore, the aged mice exhibited a more resistant phenotype during the IAV infection. Previous paper reported when infected with sub lethal doses of (50-100pfu) PR8,compared to adult mice, aged mice (18-19M, BALB/C) had higher morbidity [59]. However, some research also investigated that aged mice (2.5-years-old, C57BL/6) were more resistant to the PR8 infection than the young mice [60]. Therefore, the resistance of the young and aged mice to influenza virus may be influenced by the age, physical status and strain of the mice, and infecting virus doses.",
