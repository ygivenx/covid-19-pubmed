Of these, more than half infect multiple animal hosts [2\u20134]. For these multi-host pathogens, it is essential to differentiate between reservoir host species that enable persistence of the pathogens within a community as opposed to incidental hosts that do not play roles in disease maintenance [5]. Haydon et al. [5] further define reservoirs within multi-host communities as encompassing \u2018one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population'. The recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) exemplify how challenging it can be to identify the species that constitute these multi-host communities and their relative roles in transmitting disease within host communities and into human populations [5\u20138]. To best mitigate human risk, an understanding of these potentially complex host communities is needed across broad temporal and spatial scales.",

Archival samples and ancient DNA expand on these techniques by increasing the spatial and temporal scope of studies while also providing samples for multiple host species [9,10]. Over the past decade, archival samples, mummified remains and permafrost-preserved corpses have provided historical evidence of infection for various pathogens ranging from viruses to bacteria including influenza, Borrelia burgdorferi, HIV, chytrid fungus and avian poxviruses [10\u201312]. As long as the assumptions inherent to these methods are acknowledged and when possible controlled for (such as sampling bias or the effects of specimen preparation and preservation methodology on DNA quality and amplification), museum sampling can be valuable for identifying potential host species and understanding broad geographical and temporal patterns of disease, especially in regions difficult to sample.",

Past studies on avipoxviruses (part of the same double-stranded DNA virus family Poxviridae) demonstrated the potential value of museum specimens in providing evidence of pox infection in wild passerine birds as far as a century ago [11,12]. MPXV causes clinical symptoms similar to smallpox in humans, infecting human populations throughout Central Africa, predominantly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) [13\u201316]. Since the late 1980s, human populations in Central Africa have seen an unprecedented 20-fold increase in MPXV infections [17]. MPXV is known to infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, non-human primates and rodents; however, the current knowledge of primary MPXV host species is limited. The first recorded description of MPXV occurred in 1958; however, reports of pox-like outbreaks occur as early as 1936 in non-human primates and may be attributed to MPXV instead of smallpox [18].",

The clustered, self-limiting and sporadic transmission patterns of MPXV in human populations seem to indicate that a majority of human cases result from direct transmission from wildlife [14,27,28]. Previous studies using interview data from outbreaks in the 1980s suggest that 72% [29] to 78.1% [14] of all MPXV cases result from contact with wildlife. If these estimates are accurate, it becomes crucial to understand the prevalence of MPXV among various host species and, more importantly, how MPXV prevalence level interfaces with the role that each species plays in disease maintenance and transmission into human populations. It remains unknown which host species are required to maintain MPXV circulation within host communities, and whether these are different from the species that contribute to infections in human populations.",

Until this study, all evidence of MPXV infection of the Congo-Basin strain in wild rodent populations, except for the singular isolation of MPXV virus in F. anerythrus, has historically been serological in nature, and from a limited time period [16,20,21,23,26].",

A 9\u201325 mm2 sample was collected from the ventral side of the proximal axillary front legs (armpit), lower neck or abdomen with an effort to preserve the appearance of each specimen. No obvious skin lesions were noted during sample collection. Samples were stored dry in collection tubes at room temperature prior to DNA extraction. Past laboratory experiments on the 2003 USA outbreak of MPXV within rodent populations showed that skin served as a reliable tissue for MPXV DNA detection [25]. Species identifications were assigned based on accession tags on each individual and cross-checked with the database of the museum.",

When coupled together, RT-PCR and HRM allow for the amplification and sensitive detection of DNA at low copy numbers [35]. Sanger sequencing was used to then verify HRM putative positives. Using a touchdown PCR protocol on a LightCycler\u00ae 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Diagnostics), RT-PCR assays were screened for two different MPXV amplicons G2R_G (123-bp) and G2R_WA (101 or 104-bp). Both these amplicons were developed by Li et al. [36] and represent different regions of the tumour necrosis factor receptor gene. We modified the primers used by Li et al. [36] to optimize RT-PCR amplification without the use of a probe. A single nucleotide polymorphism in G2R_G and a 3 bp deletion in the Congo-Basin strain in G2R_WA allowed for the distinction between the West African and Congo-Basin strains of MPXV [36]. Samples were loaded onto clear 384-well plates, with four replicates for each amplicon. Amplicons were run on separate plates with negative controls and, in the case of G2R_WA plates, serial dilutions of an altered positive control. The crossing point (Cp) for the G2R_G positive samples was 48.48 (95% CI, 47.11\u201349.84) and the Cp for the G2R_WA samples was 52.77 (95% CI, 52.17\u201353.37).

Museum studies can be subject to sampling bias with uneven coverage across geographical areas. Additionally, the process of field collection to museum storage often does not follow precautions for avoiding contamination between specimens; instruments used in preparation are not sterilized between specimens and specimens are often in close contact to others within museum storage cabinets. Given the lack of genetic diversity in the amplicons chosen for this study, it is difficult to identify potential contamination events. In our study, MPXV prevalence varied greatly based on the museum of origin.

Both F. anerythrus and congicus showed high MPXV prevalence levels and also have the largest distributional ranges in the DRC, suggesting that they may play a dominant role in the transmission of MPXV within host communities, and to secondary hosts such as humans (figure 2). In addition to geographical distribution, observed differences in MPXV prevalence may be due to species-specific social behaviours that affect MPXV transmission rates. For instance, F. congicus is a highly social species that often lives in groups of up to four individuals [52]. In Gabon, F. anerythrus individuals are often seen in close pairs that travel together and allo-groom while sitting in contact. By contrast, F. lemniscatus individuals are often in groups, but usually maintain 5\u201320 m spacing, while F. pyrropus individuals are largely solitary [53]. These social behaviours may contribute to the high MPXV infection levels seen in F. anerythrus and low MPXV infection levels seen in F. lemniscatus and pyrropus. Other non-behavioural differences between species could also account for these prevalence differences including susceptibility of different species, viral titre levels, duration of infection and tissue tropism for viral replication. MPXV was detected in at least one animal for all species with higher sample sizes (greater than 18), raising the possibility that other host species may be identified with further testing.",

Previous studies using ecological niche modelling methods predicted spatial distributions of MPXV similar to this study, and coincide with humid lowland evergreen tropical forests [54\u201356].

F. congicus is MPXV positive in areas of the DRC that coincide with the distribution of anerythrus; similarly, almost all MPXV positives found in this study for all Funisciurus species overlap in range with anerythrus. Likewise, all four co-occurrences of positive samples in the same locality and year included anerythrus. These observed patterns might be explained by several factors: (i) F. anerythrus is the primary reservoir species and allows for transmission to other species only when they co-occur with anerythrus, (ii) MPXV persistence depends primarily on a critical host density of any competent host species, but is limited in Angola where only F. congicus and pyrropus coexist, (iii) other environmental constraints, such as the transition from DRC's forest habitat to Angola's woody savannah [57], limit MPXV to the area occupied by anerythrus, (iv) sampling and specimen collection is biased towards areas that are part of anerythrus' range and (v) differences between museum specimen preparation/storage affect the ability to detect viral DNA. Additional sampling of museum specimens for both the DRC and Angola is needed to determine if the F. congicus MPXV levels are truly this different across their range.",

[21] suggested that F. anerythrus is the main reservoir host maintaining transmission of MPXV in Central Africa, but that other species such as Heliosciurus rufobrachium play important roles in transmission in areas where they co-occur with anerythrus. Our study investigated MPXV prevalence in Funisciurus sp. only; in reality, other genera could be playing major roles in transmission. Of note is the important distinction between reservoir hosts that are able to sustain MPXV transmission, and other incidental host species that are infected but cannot or do not maintain MPXV [5,6]. Unfortunately, this distinction is challenging to make given the difficulties in determining thresholds for persistence and susceptibility in host populations, and in estimating transmission rates between species [6]. Our study cannot specifically determine which species maintain the virus; however, certain characteristics of F. anerythrus make it a strong candidate. In addition to its pair-forming social behaviour, F. anerythrus is typically found in higher abundance than other Funisciurus species, and is thought to be better at colonizing areas due to its ability to swim and opportunistically forage in both arboreal and terrestrial habitats [53].",

Notably, our results suggest that museum sampling not only offers invaluable information about past infections but could also guide efforts to understand current and future outbreaks. Ongoing outbreaks, such as the recent 2016 MPXV outbreaks among humans in Central African Republic and among chimpanzees in Cameroon, emphasize the need for more research and sampling efforts to understand these complex systems. Our results suggest that future surveillance of MPXV within host populations should (i) target F. anerythrus and congicus across their spatial distribution, (ii) examine genetic diversity among host species to elucidate transmission dynamics and (iii) analyse contact rates between humans and squirrels to better understand Funisciurus contributions to human infection.",
