Under the former Infectious Disease Act from 1998, diseases were notifiable by either physicians (group B notifiable diseases, D3P in Figure 1) or laboratories (group C diseases, D3X). When the new Public Health Act came into force in December 2008, both group B and C diseases became notifiable to the MHS for both physicians and laboratories [6]. The notification timeframe of 1 working day remained unchanged, likewise the timeframe for group A diseases, which require immediate notification upon disease suspicion either by physicians or laboratories. The timeframe for reporting from the MHS to the NHS, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM); D6 in Figure 1), was reduced for some group B and C diseases: from 7 to 3 days for hepatitis A, Q fever and psittacosis, and from 1 month to 7 days for pertussis and malaria. In this study, we evaluate whether the legal adjustments resulted in faster reporting and whether legal and outbreak control timeframes were met.",

From those, we excluded notifications of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jacob disease and tuberculosis, as the notification procedures were not comparable with the rest. Group A diseases (polio, smallpox, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and viral haemorrhagic fever) were excluded as they were notifiable upon suspicion, before laboratory confirmation. Hepatitis C and chronic hepatitis B were excluded as date of disease onset in most cases was not known. We also excluded rare diseases with less than 10 notifications in the full study period. As a result, we included 19 notifiable diseases for the time period of validity of the former Act, until the end of 2008, and 28 diseases for the time period of validity of the new Act from 2009 onwards. For each case, date of symptom onset (TO), date of laboratory confirmation (TX), date of notification at the MHS (TRL) and date of reporting to the RIVM (TRN) were extracted. As the MHS did not provide all dates for every case, only cases that had dates available to calculate delays were included in the study.",

This is particularly useful when we are dealing with strongly right-skewed distributions, as is the case with delay times. Statistical calculations were performed on medians and means. Since there was substantial overlap in outcomes, we chose to present the outcomes on medians for reasons of clarity and representativeness. As the number of notifications per disease varied widely, averages of medians of delays per diseases were calculated per period as well. Medians and boxplots were calculated per year for notification and reporting delay to study trends over time within periods. Percentage of six diseases notified after 3 days (including weekend days) of most recent notifications in 2016\u20132017 were calculated for comparison with percentages calculated by Reijn et al. for these diseases over period 1 [1].",

Midpoints of the ranges of incubation periods for 10 person-to-person transmissible diseases were retrieved from the national guidelines of the RIVM and medians of serial interval distributions for eight of these 10 diseases were retrieved from literature [2,9-11]. Lastly, we included a timeframe for outbreak control calculated by Bona\u010di\u0107 et al. for six person-to-person transmissible diseases based on the proportion (PIR2) of expected new infections produced by each secondary case at the time of notification of the index case to the MHS [2]. An outbreak is controlled, in other words the incidence begins to decline, if the average number of cases produced by an infected person is < 1. The number of cases produced by each secondary case is PIR2 multiplied by the reproduction number. Therefore, outbreak control can be achieved if PIR2 \u00d7 R < 1. The following total local delays (D1) were determined to achieve the outbreak control timeframe: 17 days for hepatitis A, 42 days for hepatitis B, 5 days for measles, 8 days for mumps, 4.5 days for pertussis and 3 days for shigellosis.",

We observed a steady reduction in the median delay by 1 day every 2 years, already starting in period 1. While notification systems involving laboratories generally lead to more timely notifications than those involving only physicians [5], we observed a longer average notification delay for diseases notifiable for laboratories than for diseases notifiable for physicians in period 1. The gradual decrease since 2003 was probably related to local agreements between MHS, physicians and microbiologists on anonymous pre-notifications for group B diseases by the laboratory. This was recommended under the former law to reduce reporting delay in group B diseases [13]. In our opinion, the variety of notification procedures explains why a substantial delay reduction was only achieved in 2011. In 2016\u20132017, for all six diseases studied by Reijn et al., the percentage of cases notified more than 3 days after laboratory confirmation was substantially reduced, and legal thresholds were achieved for at least 80% of cases for D3 (82.3%). Nevertheless, for some diseases, notifications by the involved physicians and laboratories still need to become more timely, namely botulism, diphtheria, hantavirus infections, leptospirosis, malaria, and infections with community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and STEC. These diseases have in common that they are rare and may need additional laboratory tests after initial confirmation, which are performed by specialised reference laboratories leading to delay in notification. For STEC infections, this delay is of special concern as early identification of a common source is important. We recommend that MHS monitor notification delays in their region and identify ways of improvement together with local laboratories and involved physicians.",

Another influence may have been the quarterly feedback of notification delays that RIVM has provided to the MHS since 2006, as it can be used by MHS to monitor and evaluate notification timeliness and in their communication with health professionals. Nevertheless, these developments have only contributed to shorter notification delays since the legal adjustment obliging laboratories to notify in addition to physicians.

However only a minority of laboratories reported more than 90% of cases timely [4]. An international systematic literature review of publications on timeliness of notification systems, published between 2000 and 2017, revealed that notification delay at local level was evaluated most frequently [5]. Timeframes for notification varied between the included studies, but the most common predefined timeframe, either legal or defined for the study itself, was within 48 hours. Timeliness of notification systems was sufficient in only a minority of studies. Notifications by laboratories and by laboratories combined with notifications by physicians, as in the Netherlands, were related to more timely notifications [5,14]. Short delays, as those achieved in the Netherlands, are also observed in other European countries: both Germany and the UK have reported a majority of notifications arriving at LHD within 1 day [5,15-18].",

In the Netherlands, thresholds for notification within two incubation periods still are not met for bacterial pathogens causing gastrointestinal diseases such as enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and STEC, Shigella and Salmonella typhi fever, which has been observed before [1]. In our opinion, this is related to a short incubation period in combination with patient delay in case of mild disease and doctor delay for not directly initiating laboratory testing. Timeframes for outbreak control involving total local delay (D1) were only met for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and measles, the latter meeting the timeframe for the first time in the period 2013\u20132017. This was probably a consequence of the outbreak in 2013\u20132014, when the disease identification delay was reduced by, among other things, the RIVM alert systems. The performance threshold of measles was close to the threshold of 80%. Therefore, we advise to further decrease patient, doctor and laboratory testing delays, especially for bacterial gastroenteritis and measles. Given the current measles outbreaks in Europe and regular imported cases in the Netherlands, we recommend enhancing doctors\u2019 awareness and optimising laboratory confirmation procedures to achieve early detection of measles cases for optimal outbreak control [19].

During outbreaks, public health professionals need real-time information on new cases to monitor the effect of control measures.

We recommend including these time points in every notification to enable monitoring of causes of delay before laboratory confirmation and measuring the effect of raising awareness among public and physicians during outbreaks.
