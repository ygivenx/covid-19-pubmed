            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea and dehydration in newborn piglets. The virus infects the epithelial cells of the small intestine resulting in severe mucosal atrophy and consequent malabsorption. PEDV is common and the cause of serious problems, particularly in pigs in Asia. The disease usually appears in winter during which it can cause high fatalities in suckling piglets (see for a recent review [1]). From 2010, an outbreak of PEDV has swept China with over 1 million fatalities among newborn piglets causing substantial economic losses in the swine industry [2]. The characteristics of the infection and its epidemiology were quite dramatic with morbidity and fatality approaching 100% in one-week old piglets, despite the use of commercial, inactivated vaccines. Virus transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route and possibly also by vertical transmission through lactation [2]. Currently there is no efficient way of treatment of the disease. Prevention of the infection usually relies on vaccination with cell culture adapted live-attenuated or inactivated viruses although the efficacy of current vaccines has been questioned [2], [3].",

            "text": "PEDV belongs to the alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronavirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses are important pathogens of concern for human and animal health. They occur in almost any species, usually causing respiratory or intestinal infections. Interest in these viruses has increased significantly as a result of the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and possess a positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases, which is the largest viral RNA genome known (Fig. 1A). The 5\u2032 two-third of the viral genome contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which encode two non-structural polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that direct genome replication and transcription. The remaining part of the genome contains ORFs specifying structural and non-structural proteins. They are expressed via a 3\u2032-terminal nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs, the transcription of which is regulated by conserved six-nucleotides transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs; in PEDV XUA(A/G)AC [4]). These subgenomic mRNAs encode at least four structural proteins, three membrane anchored proteins called the spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein that encapsidates the genomic RNA. The non-structural proteins expressed from the subgenomic mRNAs encode one or more accessory proteins, which are specific for each coronavirus genus. The genome structures of alphacoronaviruses including PEDV and related members such as the human coronavirus (hCoV) strains 229E and NL63 show the typical set of essential core genes but they share only one accessory gene, ORF3, located between the S and the E gene (Fig. 1A). The PEDV ORF3 gene encodes a 224 amino acids (aa) long protein with three to four predicted transmembrane domains [5].",

Trimers of S form the characteristic spikes on the viral surface which interact with the host receptor and mediate membrane fusion. PEDV was reported to utilize the porcine aminopeptidase N as a receptor [6]. Yet, PEDV is usually propagated in VERO cells, which are derived from the African green monkey kidney, indicating that PEDV can utilize non-porcine receptors for cell entry. Propagation of PEDV in cell culture requires addition of trypsin which is believed to prime or activate the S protein for membrane fusion during virus cell entry and syncytia formation [7] Recently it was demonstrated that trypsin cleavage may also play a role in detachment of the virus from infected cells [8]. Interestingly, a cell culture adapted strain was reported to replicate in the absence of trypsin [9], which suggests that the virus acquired mutations in the S protein conferring its trypsin-independence. The S protein also stimulates the induction of neutralizing antibodies and hence is an important target in developing effective vaccines.",

Here we report the first reverse genetic system for PEDV based on targeted RNA recombination. Establishment of the reverse genetic system included two stages (Fig. 1B). One was the generation of the chimeric virus mPEDV, a PEDV derivative carrying spikes derived from the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), hence growing only in murine cells. In the second stage the mPEDV virus was used as a recipient virus to reintroduce the PEDV spike along with other genome alterations, in casu the deletion of the ORF3 gene or the insertion of foreign, reporter genes. The generated PEDV derivatives now carrying again PEDV spikes could be easily selected by their regained tropism for non-murine cells.",

This gene was replaced by a hybrid gene encoding a chimeric S protein composed of the 1,263 aa long ectodomain from MHV S and the transmembrane domain plus cytoplasmic tail (61 aa) from PEDV S. RNA was transcribed from the T7 promotor of this vector and electroporated into PEDV-infected VERO cells after which the cells were overlaid onto a murine cell (L cells) monolayer.

Candidate recombinant viruses carrying the PEDV spikes can be selected by their regained ability to replicate in VERO cells. Apart from the wild-type recombinant virus (r-wtPEDV) we aimed at constructing a virus lacking the ORF3 gene (PEDV-\u0394ORF3). A number of cell culture adapted viruses including the strain used in this study have each acquired during passaging an identical 51 nucleotide in-frame deletion in the ORF3 gene, giving rise to a 17 amino acid deletion (aa 82\u201398) in their ORF3 protein [10]. We constructed a transfer vector (pPEDV-\u0394ORF3, Fig. 2A) from which the entire ORF3 gene was deleted. Donor RNAs transcribed from the pPEDV and pPEDV-\u0394ORF3 transfer vectors were electroporated into mPEDV-infected L cells after which we were able to recover and purify the r-wtPEDV and PEDV-\u0394ORF3 viruses in VERO cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the intended loss of the ORF3 gene from the viral genome (Fig. 4A) and the genetic identity of the ORF3 lacking virus was further verified by sequencing of the RT-PCR product (data not shown). The PEDV-\u0394ORF3 grew unimpaired in cell culture (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that the ORF3 gene product is not required for virus propagation in vitro. In addition, the successful deletion of the ORF3 gene from the viral genome demonstrated the feasibility of the mPEDV-based targeted RNA recombination system to manipulate the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome.",

These marker genes are under the transcriptional control of the TRS of ORF3 (CTAGAC) which is located in the 3\u2032end of the S gene, 46 nucleotides upstream of the ORF3 gene. The Renilla luciferase gene was also inserted as an extra expression cassette between the ORF1b and S gene, creating the pPEDV-Rluc vector. To this end the otherwise overlapping ORFs 1b and S were first separated and a unique BamHI restriction site was introduced (p-rPEDV vector, Fig. 2A and B), which did not hamper the generation of a viable virus (data not shown). The Renilla luciferase gene was subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of the p-rPEDV vector under control of the TRS in ORF1B (GTAAAC) originally driving S gene expression, whereas the S gene was provided with a new TRS (GTAAAC; Fig. 2B). The PEDV-\u0394ORF3/GFP, PEDV-\u0394ORF3/Rluc and PEDV-Rluc recombinant viruses were successfully recovered by the targeted RNA recombination procedure. RT-PCR analyses confirmed the insertion of both reporter genes at the intended positions (Fig. 5A), which was further confirmed by sequencing.",

The result shows (Fig. 5B) that luciferase expression levels were linearly related to the MOI during the early phase of infection until 12 hours p.i. whereas at 24 hours p.i. luciferase values converged due to reinfections. Similar kinetics of luciferase expression, but to higher levels, was observed for the PEDV-\u0394ORF3/Rluc recombinant virus (Fig. 5B). Next we studied the GFP expression of the PEDV-\u0394ORF3/GFP virus upon infection of VERO cells at two MOI\u2019s. GFP expression in PEDV-\u0394ORF3/GFP virus infected cells could be seen starting from 9 hours p.i. and became clearly evident at 12 hours p.i. (Fig. 5C). The cell adapted PEDV DR13 p100 strain can propagate in the absence of trypsin in the growth medium but does not form syncytia when trypsin is absent. Yet the clustered appearance of GFP-positive cells suggests that the virus predominantly spreads locally from cell to cell which may correlate with the reported cell surface attachment of progeny viruses released from infected cells in the absence of trypsin [11].",

The readout of the classical virus neutralization assay with wild-type PEDV is based on the visual inspection of cytopathic effect and can only be done after a multicycle infection which takes at least 2\u20133 days. Thus, the PEDV-\u0394ORF3/GFP and PEDV-\u0394ORF3/RLuc virus were preincubated with dilutions of serum obtained from an experimentally PEDV-infected pig and control serum, and the mixtures were subsequently added to VERO cells and incubated after which the GFP and Renilla luciferase expression was recorded at 9 and 6 hours p.i., respectively (Fig. 5D). In contrast to the control serum, the PEDV antibody-positive serum was able to neutralize PEDV infection as reflected by the reduction of GFP positive cells and luciferase activity. The results demonstrate that neutralization of the PEDV-\u0394ORF3/GFP and PEDV-\u0394ORF3/RLuc virus can already be scored within a single replication cycle, thereby significantly speeding up the assay time. This type of assay is additionally preferred as it avoids the subjectivity that is associated with scoring of cytopathic effects.",

Intriguingly, propagation of PEDV isolates in tissue culture cells readily leads to deletions within ORF3 suggesting a dispensable role, at least for the parts deleted from the ORF3 protein, for viral replication in vitro. In all these adapted viruses a shorter ORF3 gene product is still translated with a minimal size of 91 amino acids [10]. The ORF3 gene of the cell-adapted DR13 vaccine strain (GenBank accession no.: JQ023162.1) employed in our study has a 49 nucleotide deletion compared to that of the parental DR13 virus (GenBank accession no.: JQ023161.1), but still encodes the N-terminal 81 residues long ORF3 protein part including the first transmembrane domain, after which it gets out of frame due to the deletion. The deletion of the entire ORF3 gene from the genome did not have any obvious effect on viral propagation in vitro, demonstrating that this \u223c10 kD polypeptide does not serve an essential function during replication in culture cells.",

Recently it was shown that the protein exhibits ion channel activity and modulates virus production [5]. siRNA knockdown of ORF3 gene in PEDV infected cells reduced the number of particles released from the cells [5]. The question remains here why passaging of PEDV in cell culture would lead to the functional loss of a gene beneficial for virus propagation in vitro, unless the 91-residue truncated protein still provides that function. Homologues of the ORF3 protein are found in all other alphacoronaviruses. The ORF3 protein of hCoV-NL63 was shown to be N-glycosylated at the amino terminus and incorporated into virions [21]. Yet, deletion of the ORF3 gene from the viral genome had little effect on virus replication in cell culture [22]. Like for PEDV, loss of ORF3 genes of the alphacoronaviruses TGEV and hCoV-229E (here named ORF4) is associated with unimpaired virus passaging in cell culture [23], [24]. Despite a non-essential role in cell culture, the maintenance of the ORF3 gene in alphacoronavirus field isolates strongly points to an important role of the ORF3 protein in natural infection in the animal host. Consistently, the loss of virulence of life-attenuated PEDV vaccine strains has been associated with mutations in the ORF3 gene resulting from cell culture adaptation [10], [25] although a contribution of the numerous additionally acquired mutations in other genes such as the spike gene can obviously not be excluded [26], [27]. The specific function of the ORF3 protein (and other viral proteins in the 3\u2032 genome region) in PEDV replication and pathogenesis can now be further investigated using the reverse genetics system.",

Second, primers 4884 and 4885 containing a BglII and BamHI site, respectively, were used to RT-PCR amplify the ORF1a fragment which was introduced into the BamHI digested pPEDV-S-3T vector creating the pPEDV-1a-S-3T plasmid. Third, primers 4922 and 4923 that contain a BglII and BamHI in the overhang, respectively, were used to amplify the ORF1b fragment by RT-PCR. This fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of the pPEDV-1a-S-3T vector, creating the p-rPEDV vector.",
