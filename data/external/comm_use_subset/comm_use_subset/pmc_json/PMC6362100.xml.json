            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to Coronaviridae family in the order of Nidovirale1. They are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with an outer envelope and crown-like morphologies, formed by spike (S) attachment glycoproteins2. Based on phylogenetic analysis, all CoVs are classified into four genera, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, or Deltacoronavirus3. Currently, there are six strains of human coronaviruses (hCoVs), known to cause mild to severe, upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans2. From early 1960s to early 2000s, there were only two hCoVs known to cause infections in humans, 229E (Alphacoronavirus) and OC43 (Betacoronavirus)4. In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV (Betacoronavirus), originating from Guangdong province in China, resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths worldwide5. Following this outbreak, hCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronavirus) and hCoV-HKU1 (Betacoronavirus)6 were identified as sources of upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections in hospitalized patients7. More recently, MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) has been identified as the etiological agent for an ongoing epidemic of severe respiratory infection with high mortality rate in the Middle East5.",

In the absence of virus-specific control measures, the key to controlling a reemergence of SARS-CoV and spread of MERS-CoV, is rapid detection and isolation of suspect cases. Large scale, population-based seroprevalence studies are very useful for identification of critical control points in disease outbreaks as they provide important data about susceptible populations and potential of future outbreaks through predictive modeling9. Use of purified or recombinant viral antigen based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) coupled with molecular detection assays is an effective approach in population based surveillance studies10. We have developed and validated hCoV recombinant nucleocapsid protein (recN) indirect ELISAs that individually detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to all six hCoVs.",

However, traditional plate ELISAs are limited to detecting IgG antibodies to a single hCoV recN antigen per well. In contrast, a magnetic bead-based multiplexed immunoassay (MMIA) would allow for the simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies to all six hCoV recN in a single test well, reducing sample consumption. In addition, multiplexing would allow higher sample throughput at lower reagent, labor, and material costs, without losing sensitivity and specificity of traditional ELISAs. The present work describes the development and validation of a MMIA to detect human serum IgG against six hCoV recN as a next generation screening tool in population-based seroprevalence studies.",

            "text": "The use of ROC analysis in our study not only facilitated selection of optimal MFI cut-off values, but also helped determine the accuracy and usefulness of our test method by calculating the area under the ROC curves14. A perfect test has an AUC of 1 and a useless test has an area of 0.5, the equivalent of a coin toss. Based on arbitrary criteria, the following guidelines have been suggested for interpretation of AUC values in context of test accuracy: low (0.5 < AUC \u2264 0.7), moderate (0.7 < AUC \u2264 0.9), and high (0.9 < AUC \u2264 1)15. Based on our assay test results, the calculated AUC ranged from 0.87 to 0.94, suggesting a high to high-moderate levels of accuracy and overall assay performance. The cross reactivity experiment results showed positive control of SARS-CoV reacting with group 1 hCoVs 229E and NL63 recN. A major limitation of these assays is that we are unable to distinguish the difference between cross reactivity and evidence of previous infections. SARS-CoV recN has been shown to react with polyclonal antisera of group 1 coronaviruses in a western blot analysis16. However, this cross reactivity was one-way from SARS-CoV to other hCoV recN in this study which has also been previously confirmed by Che et al., in a separate study17. The multiple sequence identity matrix of all hCoV nucleocapsid protein sequences show amino acid homology ranging from 20% to 63% (data not shown). In contrast, group 1 hCoVs showed only 20% to 22% sequence homology with group 2 hCoVs which explains the lack of detectable cross-reactivity between these two antigenic groups. However, sequence homology was high between nucleocapsid sequences of OC43 and HKU1 (%) and that of HKU1 and MERS-CoV (%). Higher percentage of nucleocapsid protein sequence homology may indicate the shared epitopes in the conserved and/or overlapping regions between hCoVs of the same antigenic groups. Since the previous hCoV infection history of patients enrolled in the study was unavailable, dual infection with OC43 and HKU1 could also have contributed to the cross-reactivity, though that is unlikely for HKU1 and MERS-CoV.",

In house indirect ELISAs for recN have been developed and standardized for screening of serum samples for IgG reactivity against hCoV-229E recN, hCoV-NL63 recN, hCoV-HKU1 recN and MERS-CoV recN, using modified version of previously described indirect ELISAs for SARS-CoV recN and hCoV-OC43 recN3 (Haynes et al.,18; Blanchard et al.,19).
