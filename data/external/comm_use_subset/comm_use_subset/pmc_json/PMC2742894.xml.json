In vertebrate systems, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is the metabolic precursor of all known naturally occurring sialic acids [6]. Neu5Ac is synthesized in the cytosol from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) by four consecutive reactions; and UDP-GlcNAc is a derivative of fructose-6-phosphate and the end-product of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (Figure 1).",

GNE contains an N-terminal epimerase domain and a C-terminal kinase domain [7]. The epimerase domain converts UDP-GlcNAc to N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), which is then phosphorylated at the 6 position by the kinase domain. GNE is feedback-inhibited by the activated form of Neu5Ac, i.e., cytidine-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac). The kinase domain belongs to the ROK (Repressor, ORF, Kinase) family. The ROK family consists of a set of bacterial proteins that include repressors for sugar catabolic operons, and sugar kinases [8]. Gne is the only known gene in the entire human genome that encodes a ROK domain-containing protein.",

            "text": "Three protein isoforms have been described for human GNE, where isoform 1 is ubiquitously expressed and is believed to be responsible for the basic supply of sialic acids. Isoforms 2 and 3 are generated by alternative splicing and show tissue specific expression patterns. Isoforms 2 and 3 have reduced epimerase activities but almost intact kinase activities and may fine-tune the production of sialic acids [9]. Wild type GNE forms homo-hexamer in solution [10], and allosteric regulation of the epimerase and kinase activities of GNE is important for the normal function of the protein [10], [11]. Mutations in the epimerase domain lead to the rare congenital metabolism disorder sialurea, which results in the production of high levels of Neu5Ac due to loss of the allosteric feedback control of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity by CMP-Neu5Ac [12]. Late onset autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy, which is also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hereinafter referred to as HIBM), and allelic Nonaka myopathy are neuromuscular disorders that are caused by a number of different mutations within the gne gene. The mutations are located at either the epimerase domain or the kinase domain [13] and lead to hypoactivity of the enzyme [11]. Mutagenesis and enzymatic activity analysis revealed that the activities of the epimerase domain and the kinase domain are interrelated such that a single mutation in one domain could affect the activities of both domains [11]. Here, we solved the structure of the dimeric GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The structure reveals the dimerization interface of the kinase domain and also suggests a possible hexameric assembly of the protein. Furthermore, the structure provides insights into the relationship between GNE mutations and GNE-related metabolism disorders.",

The zinc-binding motif is a characteristic feature for all ROK family members [14]. The kinase domain also contains a DxGxT type ATP-binding motif [15], [16]. The side chains of this ATP-binding motif residues point toward the cleft between the N-lobe and the C-lobe. Comparison with the actin/hexokinase/hsp70 ATPase domains suggests that the disordered residues 475\u2013498 form part of the binding pocket for the adenosine moiety of ATP [17] and are located near the DxGxT ATP-binding motif.

Our gel filtration data (Figure 3) show that the kinase domain exists predominantly as a dimer in the solution, with small amounts of monomer and a higher order oligomer. The apparent molecular weight of the oligomer fits a hexamer of the kinase domain (see also below). However, the possibility of a tetramer [19] cannot be completely ruled out due to the low resolution of the gel-filtration column at this molecular size range (Figure 3b). The populations of the different oligomeric states of the protein are concentration dependant (data not shown), implying that the different oligomeric states exist in equilibrium.",

All these structures contain the signature zinc-binding motif of the ROK family. The structure of E. coli putative ManNAc kinase (PDB 2aa4) was the top hit with twist-adjusted r.m.s. deviation (opt-rmsd value) of 1.94 \u00c5. The structure of a putative sugar kinase from Bacillus subtilis was the second best hit (PDB 1xc3). The other two homologous structures were transcription repressors that belong to the ROK family (PDB: 1z05 and 1z6r). Vibrio cholerae transcriptional regulator (PDB: 1z05) is a homolog of the E. coli Mlc protein (PDB: 1z6r). The latter is a transcriptional repressor that controls the expression of malT, the central transcription activator of the E. coli maltose system [22]. The structure of the GNE kinase domain aligns well with the E. coli Mlc structure: the N-lobe of GNE kinase domain aligns to the E-domain of Mlc and the C-lobe aligns to the O-domain of Mlc. It is interesting to note that the Mlc O-domain is responsible for the oligomerization of Mlc protein [22] in a way similar to the dimerization of GNE kinase through the C-lobe. However, these four structures do not contain sugar ligands that would help inform on a substrate binding mode for GNE.",

Two residues, H569 and E588, are located in the ROK family zinc-binding signature motif and H569 directly coordinates the zinc ion.

Since the interlobar cleft is the site of ATP and carbohydrate binding as well as where phosphoryl transfer occurs, mutation of these residues could change the interlobar movement during catalysis and thus affect the kinase activity of the protein. For example, the first identified HIBM-related mutation, M712T [13], would likely abolish the hydrophobic interaction of the side chain of M712 with that of L523 from the C-lobe helix (Figure 8a). In the previous study [11], the M712T mutation has been shown to cause a 30% reduction in the kinase activity without affecting the epimerase activity of full length GNE. On the contrary, mutations of other residues in this second group reduce not only the kinase activity but also the epimerase activity of the full length protein ([11], Table 1). This suggests that the kinase domain is allosterically coupled to the epimerase domain. The structure of the full length GNE is needed to fully understand the coupled effects of the kinase and epimerase domains.",
