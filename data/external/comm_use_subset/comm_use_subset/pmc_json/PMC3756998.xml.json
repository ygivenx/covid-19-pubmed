Alzheimer's disease, Prion-associated encephalopathies, Huntington's disease, Type II diabetes, Parkinson's disease and many more diseases have been linked to protein fibrillation [2], [3]. During the fibrillation process globular proteins undergo structural perturbation followed by a series of structural transitions leading to the formation of insoluble fibrils, containing \u03b2-cross sheet like structure [4]. Excessive deposition/accumulation of stable, ordered and amorphous protein aggregates are collectively called amyloid fibrils [5]. Deposition of excessive stable, ordered and amorphous protein aggregates in organs and tissues lead to crucial biological dysfunctions and deleterious pathological symptoms [6]. Researches till date have explored the fact that despite the diversity in sequence homology, the protein fibrils share similar formation pathways and similar morphologies. However, the exact biochemical/biophysical pathways and mechanism of protein fibrillation are yet to be fully understood [7], [8].",

            "text": "Insulin, a 51-residue protein hormone, is central for regulation of blood-glucose level [9]. Due to its propensity to undergo stress induced conformational changes leading to various aggregated forms including amyloid fibrils, it has become the subject of intense study not only as a model fibril forming system but also as the insulin instability issue that reduces the efficacy of insulin therapy against type II diabetes [10]\u2013[12]. The pathological fingerprints of fibrillar insulin have been reported with amyloid deposits in patients with diabetes and in normal ageing [13]\u2013[15]. Once such a deposition takes place, it is mostly irreversible, and may lead to deleterious physiological conditions [16]. It has been reported that soluble oligomers formed at the pre-fibrillar state produces most toxic effects [17]\u2013[19]. Thus, research aiming to delay or inhibit the fibrillation process of insulin can prove to be of great therapeutic value.",

            "text": "Several reports were aimed at developing therapeutic agents to inhibit or slow down the amyloid formation [20]\u2013[21]. These agents routed via natural source or synthetic pathways are generally termed as amyloid inhibitors. The idea behind such anti-amyloid agent is to inhibit the creation of amyloidogenic aggregate and/to arrest the amyloid construction. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (Chain A \u201321 residues; Chain B \u201330 residues) held together by two disulphide bonds. The solution state of insulin contains a mixture of different oligomeric species including hexamer, tetramer, dimer and monomer [22]. Chain A consists of two helical sections: A2\u2013A8 and A13\u2013A20, whereas Chain B includes a region of extended structure B1\u2013B8, helical section B9\u2013B19, a turn B20\u2013B23 and a terminal extended \u03b2-strand B24\u2013B28 [9]. Dissociation of insulin oligomer into monomer facilitates the fibrillation process [10]\u2013[11]. The existence of the conformational intermediates that serve as the precursor for formation of the active nuclei, ultimately culminating into the fibrils is also crucial. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that trifluoroethanol a small molecule could delay the fibrillation of insulin by interfering with the oligomer to monomer dissociation step [23]. Based on these findings, it appears logical to target such steps in order to prevent or slow down the fibrillation process.",

            "text": "Peptides consisting of natural amino acids can be considered as advantageous, as they are devoid of many drawbacks and thus preferred as therapeutics. In the present study we are reporting a nine-residue peptide, NK9 (NIVNVSLVK), which delays the fibrillation process of insulin even in sub-stoichiometric ratio. NK9 is adopted from the middle of the SARS corona virus E-protein primary sequence [24], initially chosen serendipitously. Generally, the polypeptide fragments that have property of self-recognition are important for design of peptide based anti-amyloidogenic agents [25]. The factors, like peptide length and selectivity with respect to L-or D-analogues of peptides, are more crucial according to many groups [26]\u2013[30]. Peptides constituting hydrophobic residues are known to execute inhibition of oligomerization in several biologically important proteins [31]\u2013[33]. NK9 has beta-sheet breaker-hydrophobic residues, like Ile, Val and Leu. The present study helps us to understand the probable mechanism of action for delaying of fibrillation process, where NK9 interferes with the nucleation phase of insulin to decrease the toxicity of the overall process. There are reports that showed different peptides are involved in delaying and/or inhibition of fibrillation process in proteins without giving any significant experimental evidence or emphasis over the cause of the phenomena [27]\u2013[29]. The experimental evidence that NK9 binds with insulin molecule is derived with the help of fluorescence anisotropy experiment. The molecular interaction of peptide with insulin was monitored by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and modeled using molecular dynamics simulation [34]\u2013[35] and validated using saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR experiment [36]\u2013[37]. The study helps us understanding the interaction of the peptide with insulin and the underlying mechanism for delaying of fibrillation process.",

Since the fibrillation proceeds via dissociation of insulin oligomers into the monomers, strategies for prevention of insulin fibrillation also included among other things promotion of self-association to prevent dissociation into monomer. This was the rationale behind the use of metal ions like Zn2+ or Ca2+ to stabilize the hexameric structure [39]\u2013[40]. Another approach to stabilize insulin was to promote the native hydrophobic interactions and/or to block unwanted interactions. Polyhydroxy compounds such as carbohydrates and glycerol prohibited water penetration into the hydrophobic core promoting native hydrophobic interactions [41]\u2013[42].",

As usual, the ThT fluorescence remains negligible for a considerable period of time (lag time) followed by sharp increase, which eventually leveled off. The lag time for insulin fibrillation is 120 min. NK9 delayed the fibrillation process of insulin in a concentration dependant manner. Even 50 \u03bcM concentration of NK9, where molar ratio of insulin to NK9 is 1\u22360.14, showed the delaying effect in fibrillation process. At 175 \u03bcM concentration of NK9 (1\u22360.5 molar ratio), the lag time of fibrillation process was 236 minutes. The lag time increased as NK9 concentration increased (Table S1). However, the lag time remained unchanged after a point in NK9 concentration.

We found that maximum lag time (200 min) was observed when NK9 was added at the beginning of the incubation. Nevertheless, when NK9 was added after 15 min of incubation the lag time decreased to \u223c190 min. It became 125 min when the peptide was added after 30 min of incubation and this is almost identical with that of insulin without the peptide (Figure 1B). At 30 min addition of NK9, the ThT intensity kinetic profile became very similar to that with insulin alone but the saturation intensity level was lower. In fact, the saturation intensity level of ThT fluorescence was affected very little when the NK9 was added. Thus, maximum protection against fibrillation was obtained when NK9 was present in the system at the time of thermal incubation. This implies that NK9 starts interfering at the initial stages of the nucleation process. This initial stage of nucleation in the absence of NK9 seems to be over in 30 min incubation. Addition of NK9 after 30 min thus did not affect the fibrillation kinetics, but affected only the texture of the fibril possibly by interacting with post nucleation structural intermediates.",

TEM data shows that insulin fibrils in absence of NK9 are branched and those in presence of NK9 are less associated (Figure 2). Nevertheless, the apparent rate constant for fibril growth phase remained almost the same in every case. This indicates that NK9 only delayed the association process in the pre-fibrillar nucleation phase and it does not kinetically affect the post nucleation process leading to fibril growth, although it does have an impact on fibril morphology.",

We investigated the changes in the secondary structure of insulin in the absence and presence of NK9 with the help of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Insulin, a helical protein, shows dual minima at 222 nm and 208 nm that are the characteristics of all major helical proteins. Figure 3A and 3B are the Far UV-CD spectra of insulin at different time points of incubation in the absence as well as presence of NK9, respectively. With the increase in the time of incubation, the negative ellipticity values at 222 nm and 208 nm also decrease, which indicates increased order in the secondary structure of insulin. In order to have a quantitative analysis of the change in secondary structure of insulin during fibrillation process, we have de-convoluted the far UV-CD data with the help of CDNN software. After 100 min of incubation, the helix content of insulin decreased to 39% with little increase in \u03b2-sheet structure. Whereas, the secondary structure of insulin in presence of NK9, remained almost unchanged for 180 min of incubation. At 240 min of incubation, helix content of insulin in presence of NK9 decreased only to 42%. This implies that NK9 helps insulin to retain its secondary structure for a prolonged period of time. Appearance of insoluble aggregates makes it difficult to continue the CD measurement beyond 100 min of incubation for insulin alone and 240 min of incubation, for insulin in presence of NK9. Nevertheless, NK9 does not have a well-defined structure even in the presence of insulin (Figure 3C).",

            "text": "FT-IR has been used to study secondary structure of proteins for decades [47], [50]\u2013[53]. It is particularly sensitive to changes of \u03b2-sheet content in proteins [43]. Being an \u03b1 helical protein insulin has a characteristic peak at \u223c1654 cm\u22121 in its amide I contour. On conversion into amyloid like fibrils, the peak shifts to 1628 cm\u22121, which is the hallmark of cross \u03b2-sheet structure formation [54]. Figure 3 shows FT-IR spectra of insulin measured at various intervals of incubation. Plot of A1628/A1654 against time of incubation (Figure 4) showed very small changes in the ratio and spectral shape take place for the first 2 h of incubation. The transition involving significant increases in the A1628/A1654 ratio was observed after 2 h of incubation, and it persisted for 4 h. This is the cause of steady increase in intensity at 1628 cm\u22121, with a concomitant decrease in intensity at 1654 cm\u22121 (Figure 4). This change reflects the formation of cross \u03b2 sheet structure in insulin at the expense of its helical content. Insulin in presence of NK9 retains its secondary structure for 4 h of incubation (Figure 4). A1628/A1654 ratio at 4.5 h of incubation showed a much lower value as compared to the ratio in case of insulin alone after 4 h of incubation (Figure 4). This observation indicates that NK9 slowed down the stepwise changes in insulin secondary structure during the process of fibrillation. The amount of helical content left and \u03b2-sheet content increased after formation of mature fibril was calculated using the multi curve fitting program of origin 6.0 software (Figure S1). Curve fitting analysis showed that insulin in the presence and absence of NK9 has similar percentages of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet content (Figure 4). Although NK9 delays the fibrillation process of insulin, mature fibrils of insulin have \u223c60% \u03b2-sheet content irrespective of NK9 presence.",

The column was pre-calibrated using size exclusion marker proteins \u03b2-amylase, ADH, BSA, carbonic anhydrase, lysozyme, and ribonuclease. The calibration data fitted nicely into a linear equation (correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.98). Since incubation of insulin samples for fibrillation experiment were done using citrate phosphate buffer of pH 2.6, the HPLC column was equilibrated with this buffer for experiment with insulin. It was confirmed by using BSA and lysozyme that both proteins retained their globular shape as retention time at this acidic pH did not significantly change from those at pH 7.0 (data not shown). Aliquots of insulin solution at different time points of incubation were centrifuged at 4000\u00d7g force to remove visible turbidity. Supernatant was loaded on to the HPLC column. Prior incubation of insulin in citrate phosphate buffer showed a retention time of 16.9 ml (Figure 5A). This retention time corresponds to the trimeric structure of insulin that corroborates well with earlier findings by Banga and co-workers [39]. Retention time of insulin remained unchanged for 1.5 hr with concomitant decrease in its absorbance value. The increase in incubation time up to 2 hr, shifted the retention time of insulin to 17.9 min that corresponds to the monomeric insulin. After 2 hr of incubation, fluorescence emission intensity just started to increase (Figure 1) implying that active nucleus of insulin fibrils was formed just after 2 hr of incubation. The size exclusion chromatography data shows that the building block of this active nucleus is a monomer of insulin. This conclusion is in agreement with the literature data as well [55].",

The first peak could be due to Insulin-NK9 complex and the latter for NK9 alone (Figure 5B). Since NK9 does not contain any tryptophan residue there was no peak appeared at 18.1 min when absorbance values were taken at wavelength 280 nm (Figure 5C). This also confirms that the peak appeared at 18.1 min was for NK9 alone. Since NK9 is a short peptide, binding with insulin does not have any significant influence on molecular mass and on the retention time of insulin. Consequently, the retention time of insulin-NK9 complex is identical with that of insulin alone. As incubation time proceeds, the absorbance value at both retention time points decreased. This indicates that the insoluble part of insulin, contain the NK9 peptide. Since there was not much change in retention time of insulin-NK9 complex during 5 hr of incubation, it is understood that NK9 stabilizes the associated trimeric state of insulin.",

After 30 min of incubation, insulin associated to form a large oligomer of 24 nm in size along with its trimeric association state (Figure 6A). As the time of incubation increased, population of 24 nm sized oligomer increased and retained up to 120 min of incubation. Though, the intensity scattered by the higher oligomer is more than the trimeric association state of insulin, the percentage of trimeric insulin is much more than that of the higher oligomer. This observation is also evident from our size exclusion chromatography data. After 100 min of incubation, insulin trimer disintegrates and forms insulin monomer of 1.3 nm (Figure 6). This is believed to be the building block of active nucleus of the fibrillation process [56]. Insulin in presence of NK9 shows hydrodynamic radii of 2.1 nm indicating the trimeric association state. This 0.1 nm increase is within experimental error, so we cannot say that this increment is due to binding with a 9 residue peptide. However, subtle change in conformation of insulin bound with NK9 is reflected due to the increase in scatting intensity as the incubation time increases (Figure 6B). Insulin in the presence of NK9 retained its trimeric state up to 240 minutes of incubation (Figure 6C). However, after 240 min of incubation, insulin started to form visible precipitates and renders the DLS experiment unsuitable to be conducted for further time points.",

Theoretically, as the interaction between the ligand and the protein increases, rotational diffusion of the ligand decreases, that results in increase in anisotropy [57]. In Figure 7 as the concentration of insulin increases, the anisotropy also increases rapidly in the initial part of the curve. Thus, in the beginning, the added protein was immediately bound to NK9. The increase in anisotropy became smaller and finally reached a plateau. The plateau reflects anisotropy of the saturated insulin NK9 complex. This experiment was carried out at two different temperatures (25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C) to validate the binding of NK9 with insulin at higher temperature. Anisotropy experiment at 25\u00b0C shows the plateau beyond an insulin concentration of 4 \u00b5M, which implies almost 2\u22361 binding of NK9 to insulin. Whereas, anisotropy experiment at 37\u00b0C showed plateau beyond 2 \u03bcM concentration of insulin implying almost 4\u22361 binding of NK9 to insulin. Binding curves were obtained with apparent Kd values of 2.2 \u03bcM and 1.2 \u03bcM for binding to insulin at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, respectively.

The peptide in absence and presence of insulin was predominantly characterized by intra residue and sequential NOEs between backbone proton and side chain proton resonances (Figure S1), clearly indicating that the peptide is highly flexible in solution state and does not adopt any folded conformation in presence of insulin. This result is in very good agreement with our CD data of NK9 in the context of insulin (Figure 3C). To understand the localization of NK9 in insulin we employed one dimensional proton STD NMR which is a powerful and very specific technique to identify the epitope of a ligand is in close proximity with the receptor [37]. Briefly, selective saturation to the receptor is transferred to the bound ligand via spin diffusion, without affecting the ligand signal alone. Therefore, from the difference spectrum (off resonance \u2013 on resonance) we obtain the distance information or the epitope of the ligand bound to the macromolecule. Excess of ligand compared to its receptor is used in the STD experiments to achieve effective magnetization transfer from the receptor to the ligand at its bound state (Figure 8). The strong STD effect was observed for the methyl groups of NK9 in presence of insulin (Figure 8B) but there was no STD effect in the absence of insulin (Figure 8C). Although it is difficult to pin point the aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid residue due to significant overlap of the methyl group signals, it could be from any or all of the residues from I2, V3, V5, L7 and V8 closely interacting with insulin. The I2\u03b3 and C\u03b2Hs of V3/V5/V8 of NK9 show moderate STD effects (Figure 8B). The C\u03b1Hs of NK9 are very close in proximity to the water signal. Interestingly, the C\u03b1H of S6 and L7 showed very weak STD signals (Figure 8B). Taken together, STD data qualitatively suggest a close association of hydrophobic amino acid residues with insulin (Figure 8B).",

The N-terminus of the chain B enforces a wide range of dynamicity. The docked model designates the location of NK9 binding just in between the N-ter and helical region of chain A. The fluctuation in chain B is tuned and regulated by NK9, restricting the fibril formation. The RMSD plot for chain A is found to be unaffected in the simulation course. There is no observation regarding the loss of secondary structure in any chain of insulin that corresponds to the stability of whole structure. The Rg as shown in Figure 9B, correlates nicely with the RMSD data points. The minute increase in Rg is genuine and can be attributed to the absence of crystal packing in the micro-canonical ensemble of simulation, but the large increment can be correlated to the interaction with NK9. The disulfide bridges of insulin are found to be well conserved at low pH simulation, indicating one of the reasons for the stability regarding rms deviation and gyration radius of chain A. The results discussed for RMSD and Rg plot can be more clearly explained with the help of RMSF fluctuations for both chain A and B (Figure 9C). The fluctuation with respect to the C\u03b1 atoms of chain A residues are small except for TyrA14, which is found to be in contact with Lys9 of NK9. The observed mean fluctuation of 2.5 \u00c5 is attributed to cation-\u03c0 type interaction between these two residues.

Interestingly, the atomic fluctuations seem to have converged in the next phase of analysis (50\u201375 ns) and were almost conserved as for global minima in the phase 75\u2013100 ns.

            "text": "In this work, we have developed a nine residue biocompatible peptide, NK9 that is found to interrupt the insulin fibrillation process. Using Thioflavin T fluorescence, we observed that NK9 delays the fibrillation process of insulin in a dose dependent manner. In situ, addition of NK9 into the incubating insulin solution decreases the rate of fibrillation process by slowing down the nucleation process, even at a sub-molar ratio. The insulin fibrils formed in presence of NK9 are morphologically different from those formed in its absence. NK9 is found to stabilize native-like secondary structure of insulin thus delaying its dissociation into monomer, which is a precursor for the fibril nucleus. NK9 does interfere with the nucleation process. Fluorescence anisotropy measurement confirms binding of NK9 with insulin with micro-molar affinity and the free energy of binding decreased with increase in temperature indicating hydrophobic nature of the interactions. STD NMR revealed that C\u03b3Hs of I2, C\u03b2Hs of V3, V5 and V8 residues of NK9 are in close proximity to insulin. MD simulation results are in agreement with the binding behavior of insulin with NK9. For the insulin-NK9 complex, aggregation site was found to be LeuA13 and LeuA16. As per the docked model and simulation trajectory, NK9 was found to be in close proximity of LeuA13, TyrA14 and GluA17. Simulation result indicates that only a few hydrophobic residues of NK9 prevent the solvent perturbation influencing insulin fibrillation. Probable fibrillation site of insulin was also identified using BioLuminate software. Such study may provide clue to develop next generation peptides and other organic therapeutics that can be tuned to prevent protein fibrillation.",
