            "text": "Respiratory and enteric infections caused by coronaviruses have important impacts on both human and animal health. The infection of immunologically na\u00efve newborn pigs with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) results in losses approaching 100% mortality; a consequence of mal-absorptive diarrhea and dehydration caused by the destruction of infected enterocytes (Madson et al. 2016; Saif et al. 2012). Strategies for vaccination of newborn piglets have not been developed and passive immunity is the preferred method of controlling infection (Langel et al. 2016). An outbreak of PEDV on U.S. farms in 2013 resulted in the death of nearly 7 million pigs, an estimated 10% loss in U.S. pig production for that year (Stevenson et al. 2013). Interestingly, TGEV typically causes less destruction in swine herds due to a deletion mutant of TGEV, porcine respiratory corona virus (PRCV) that replicates in the respiratory tract (Kim et al. 2000). Pigs typically recover from PRCV exposure and produce neutralizing antibodies that also neutralize TGEV resulting in a less severe infection in TGEV exposed piglets. In herds that have not been exposed to PRCV, TGEV is similarly lethal to PEDV. Strategies for vaccination of newborn piglets have not been developed and passive immunity is the preferred method of controlling infection (Langel et al. 2016). In older pigs, TGEV and PEDV establish productive, but non-clinical infections (Saif et al. 2012). Recently (2009, 2012 and 2016) three distinct chimeric viruses containing the S gene and 3a sequences of PEDV on a TGEV backbone have been described in Europe. These viruses, named swine enteric coronaviruses, cause clinical signs similar to PEDV but their impact is unknown since standard diagnostic techniques would not distinguish them from their parental viruses (Belsham et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Along with the human, canine and feline coronaviruses, PEDV and TGEV belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae (Lin et al. 2015). Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA viruses, placed in the order, Nidovirales. The characteristic hallmark of nidoviruses is the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The unique structural feature of coronaviruses is the \u201ccorona\u201d formed by the spike proteins protruding from the surface of the virion. Although the spike protein is the primary receptor binding protein for all coronaviruses, the corresponding cell surface receptors exhibit a wide variation (Li 2015). Delmas et al. (1992) were the first to characterize porcine aminopeptidase N (APN, ANPEP, CD13: although prior convention uses APN as the abbreviation, here we have elected to use the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee identifier ANPEP as a candidate receptor for TGEV (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee). Porcine ANPEP is a 963 amino acid, type II membrane metallopeptidase responsible for removing N-terminal amino acids from protein substrates during digestion. A variety of cells and tissues have low levels of ANPEP expression, but it is highly expressed on enterocytes. Peptide sequences in the receptor thought to be responsible for binding TGEV include a region in domain VII between amino acids 717 and 813 (Delmas et al. 1994), and the area of overlap between peptides 623\u2013722 and 673\u2013772 (Sun et al. 2012). Additionally, a structural study of the interaction between the spike protein of two coronaviruses and ANPEP implicated residue 736 as a likely binding site for not only TGEV but also porcine respiratory coronavirus; but there is evidence for TGEV binding throughout the protein (Ren et al. 2010). Several studies also identified ANPEP as a putative receptor for PEDV (Kamau et al. 2017; Li et al. 2007; Oh et al. 2003). For example, TGEV and PEDV spike protein N-terminal and C-terminal binding domains (S1-NTD-CTD) recognize porcine ANPEP in dot blot hybridization assays (Li et al. 2016). In addition, PEDV S1-NTD-CTD can bind a second potential receptor, acetylneuraminic acid (Liu et al. 2015). Pseudovirions expressing the PEDV spike protein enter ANPEP-positive porcine cell lines, such as PK-15, and virion entry is blocked with anti-ANPEP antibody. However, the TGEV-permissive porcine cell line, ST, modified to possess a CRIPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ANPEP was made resistant to TGEV, but retained the capacity to be infected with PEDV (Li et al. 2017). The biological relevance of ANPEP as PEDV receptor is supported by the ability of transgenic mice expressing porcine ANPEP becoming susceptible to infection with the virus (Park et al. 2015). In contrast, two recent papers suggest that ANPEP is not required for PEDV infection (Li et al. 2017; Shirato et al. 2016). Specifically, Shirato et al. 2016 showed that although ANPEP is not the cellular receptor in vitro for PEDV, aminopeptidase activity does promote infectivity.",

Guide 3 was selected because it possessed no editing ability in fibroblasts. It was not clear at the time if guides would have the same editing ability in both fibroblasts and zygotes. Zygotes were cultured for 5 days (morula/blastocyst stage) and transferred to surrogate pigs to gestate (Whitworth et al. 2014). The edited ANPEP alleles in offspring piglets were identified based on sequencing PCR products amplified from genomic DNA flanking exon 2. Six embryo transfers resulted in three pregnancies and two litters of viable piglets, which yielded twelve founder animals. Of the 12 founders, nine were edited and of the three founders, a boar and two gilts, were used to create the F1 litters used for the challenge studies (Online Resource Table S3). The exon 2 edits for the three breeding founder pigs are illustrated in Fig. 1A. The ANPEP-edited boar, No. 158-9, possessed bi-allelic null edits, consisting of B and C alleles. One ANPEP-modified dam, No. 158-1, was a mosaic; possessing a WT (A) allele as well as edits F, G and the null edits, D and H. The F and G alleles possessed 9 and 12 bp deletions, which were predicted to result in the deletion of peptide sequences, 294-Met-Glu-Gly and 294-Met-Glu-Gly-Asp-Val > Ile, respectively. The second dam, No. 4-2, possessed two null alleles, E and D. All frame-shift edits resulted in a premature stop codon. The phenotype of each ANPEP edit was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence of ANPEP protein in ileum (see Fig. 1B). As expected, all ANPEP WT pigs expressed ANPEP on the surface of enterocytes lining the intestine. Phenotypically, pigs possessing either the F or the G allele also showed immunoreactivity for the ANPEP protein; however, immunoreactivity was visibly weaker in pigs possessing the G allele in which four amino acids were deleted. ANPEP immunoreactivity was absent in pigs possessing two null alleles.",

The first breeding yielded piglets from only No. 158-1. As summarized in Table 1, Litter 121 consisted of eight total piglets, consisting of two pigs possessing the four amino acid deletion, one pig with the three amino acid deletion, and one ANPEP KO pig. Five WT pigs from a different litter were included as positive controls for infection. Soon after weaning, all piglets were infected with 106 TCID50 of PEDV isolate KS13-09, administered orally. To facilitate continuous exposure to virus, all modified and control pigs were housed in the same pen over the duration of the study. The presence of a productive infection was assessed by the detection of virus in the feces by RT-PCR and by IHC for the presence of viral antigen in ileum. The results, using a standard published assay that provides a good yes or no answer (Niederwerder et al. 2016), presented in Fig. 2A, showed that all pigs were strongly positive for the presence of PEDV nucleic acid in feces, beginning at 7 days after infection. By day 7 post infection, at least one pig of each phenotype was positive by real time PCR for PEDV nucleic acid in serum. IHC confirmed that all pigs possessed PEDV antigen in enterocytes lining the ileum (Fig. 2A). Since all genotypes were infected additional detailed studies were not undertaken. When taken together, these results showed that while ANPEP may play a supporting role for infection (Li et al. 2017; Shirato et al. 2016) the absence of ANPEP did not significantly affect infection of pigs with PEDV.",

Dam No. 158-1 produced 4 piglets, two of which were used in the study, and dam No. 4-2 produced 13 piglets, six of which were used in the study (summarized in Table 2). Seven WT pigs from a single litter were included as positive controls. Pigs were infected after weaning with the Purdue strain of TGEV by using the same route, dose and housing conditions described above for PEDV. A commercial RT-PCR assay was used to detect the presence of virus in fecal samples. During the first week of infection, all WT pigs were positive for TGEV nucleic acid in feces. Viral nucleic acid was not detected in feces of the single pig possessing the three amino acid deletion in ANPEP or in any of the seven KO pigs (Fig. 2B). The recovery of tissues for the assessment of TGEV antigen IHC was based on the selection of a pig at 3 days after infection, when large quantities of viral nucleic acid were present in feces (Fig. 2B). The WT pig was positive for the presence of TGEV antigen in ileum, while the ANPEP KO pig, removed from the study at the same time, was negative for antigen (Fig. 2B). The intestinal tissue from the pig possessing the three amino acid deletion was process for IHC TGEV antigen at 13 days after infection and showed the presence of antibody for viral antigen in ileum. To confirm the TGEV infection status, serum samples were tested for the presence of TGEV-specific antibody. Both blocking ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) method were used to evaluate the presence of TGEV-specific antibodies. The WT and three amino acid deletion pigs were positive for TGEV-specific antibody (Fig. 3); whereas, all ANPEP KO pigs were negative for TGEV antibody. Even though the pig possessing the three amino acid deletion was negative for TGEV nucleic acid in feces, positive TGEV antigen in ileum and a positive antibody response confirmed that this pig was productively infected. Together, these data confirm that the presence of ANPEP is required for TGEV infection of pigs. The successful infection of pigs possessing the minor ANPEP-edit that resulted in the deletion of three amino acids in the exon 2 coding region indicates that this peptide sequence is not required for TGEV infection.",

            "text": "In vitro models of infection are important tools for the characterization of virus receptors, and for understanding the mechanisms for viral attachment, entry and replication. However, results from in vitro experiments do not necessarily replicate the same findings in the natural host animal, which is composed of a complex set of cells and tissues. For example, mice made transgenic for human ANPEP (hANPEP), a receptor for human coronavirus-229E [HCoV-229E (Yeager et al. 1992)], possess similar levels of expression in the same tissues as mouse ANPEP, including high levels of hANPEP expression in epithelial cells of the intestines (Wentworth et al. 2005). hANPEP-transgenic mice are resistant to infection by intragastric inoculation with HCoV-229E, but cell lines derived from embryos and bone marrow of hANPEP mice support HCoV-229E replication in vitro. These results suggest that other factors besides ANPEP receptor expression on enterocytes are important for infection. In another example, in vitro studies of cells infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) show that SIGLEC1 on macrophages is required for infection. However, pigs lacking SIGLEC1 support PRRSV infection to the same levels as WT pigs (Prather et al. 2013). Knocking out the expression of another macrophage protein, CD163, conferred complete resistance to PRRSV, demonstrating the requirement for CD163 (Whitworth et al. 2016). Here we confirm that ANPEP is required for the infection of pigs with TGEV, but is not a biologically relevant receptor for PEDV.",

            "text": "The response to a challenge by PEDV showed infectivity in a single ANPEP null pig. Since the response is binary, i.e. the animal exhibits viremia or doesn\u2019t exhibit viremia, a single animal can provide the answer to susceptibility to the particular viral stain under investigation. Since our goal was to determine if ANPEP null animals are resistant to PEDV a single animal provided the necessary information by showing viral nucleic acid in the feces and PEDV-antigen in the ileum. In contrast, in the second challenge experiment with TGEV we were able to produce more than one litter and had six null animals that did not exhibit a fecal viral load nor TGEV-antigen in the ileum. A single piglet with the 3 bp deletion did not show a fecal viral load, but there was antigen in the ileum. It is possible that the fecal contents affected the PCR assay. For our purposes, we define positive by PCR or histochemically. Since the pigs were cohoused they should all have exposure from both the challenge and the viremia WT animals. When taken together, these results showed that while ANPEP may play a supporting role for infection (Li et al. 2017; Shirato et al. 2016) the absence of ANPEP did not significantly affect infection of pigs with PEDV. Shirato et al. (2016) showed that ANPEP expressing human and porcine cells failed to support PEDV infection, but the same cells were susceptible to infection by TGEV which further validates our model. In the Li et al. (2017), cells were created with a null ANPEP gene via CRISPR/Cas9. The resulting cells were permissive to infectivity by PEDV, but not TGEV. Other coronaviruses may also use ANPEP as an entry mediator. Due to genome similarity porcine respiratory coronavirus (a TGEV mutant) (Zhang et al. 2017) likely uses ANPEP, and other less related viruses such as porcine deltacoronavirus, another swine enteropathogen, may use ANPEP to gain entry into the cell (Li et al. 2018). Clearly additional whole animal studies need to be conducted to better understand the molecules that these viruses use to gain entry. Although PED is exceptionally lethal, neutralizing antibodies against PRCV results in a less severe TGEV infection in exposed piglets. Having a TGEV resistant pig may not be as valuable as a PRRSV or PEDV resistant pig, but this study still provides helpful data on coronavirus entry. Efforts can now be refocused on other mechanisms for PEDV viral entry. ANPEP is a multifunctional protein involved in a variety of physiological and immunological processes (Chen et al. 2012). Pigs possessing a complete knockout of ANPEP appeared normal and indistinguishable from normal littermates, i.e. they grew at normal rates, they reproduced and they did not exhibit any remarkable phenotypes. ANPEP null mice appear to have impaired angiogenesis under stressed conditions (Rangel et al. 2007) and during mammogenesis (Kolb et al. 2013). These phenotypes were neither directly measured nor observed; although sow 4-2 produced sufficient milk for her litter. In ANPEP null mice, there was decrease in thymic T cell numbers, but hematopoietic development, hemostasis, or myeloid cell function were all normal (Winnicka et al. 2010). The founder pigs in this study had no health concerns, but a complete evaluation of their phenotype including macrophage physiology, T-cell changes and mammogenesis was not performed.",

Serum from each pig was serially diluted in PBS with 5% goat serum (PBS-GS). A serum sample obtained from each pig prior to infection served as a negative control. After incubation for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, plates were washed and secondary antibody added to each well. Alexa-Fluor-488 AffiPure goat anti-swine IgG (Cat# 114-545-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was diluted 1:400 dilution in PBS-GS. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, washed with PBS, and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. The presence of fluorescence at a serum dilution of 1:5 or greater was considered positive for the presence of antibody. Antibody blocking assays were performed using a kit from Sanova (Svanovir TGEV/PRCV). Assays were performed according to the kit instructions and results reported as percent inhibition of binding of labeled TGEV-specific antibody.",

B The lower panels show immunoreactivity for ANPEP antigen in ileum sections derived from euthanized PEDV challenged pigs. Ileum sections from ANPEP WT pigs showed ANPEP immunoreactivity on the surface of enterocytes lining the intestine. Ileum from pigs possessing either the F or the G allele (9 and 12 bp in frame deletions) also showed immunoreactivity for the ANPEP protein; however, immunoreactivity was visibly weaker in pigs possessing the G allele in which four amino acids were deleted. ANPEP immunoreactivity was absent in pigs possessing two null alleles. Specific genotypes are null/F (B/F), null/G (B/G) and null/null (B/H)",
