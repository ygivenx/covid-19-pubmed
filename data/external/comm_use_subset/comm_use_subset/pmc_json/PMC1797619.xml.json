Many enveloped viruses use only a single protein to mediate the fusion of their membrane with a cellular membrane during virus entry [3,4], which makes them a particularly interesting system for understanding the membrane fusion process in mechanistic terms. A common property of viral fusion proteins is their presence at the surface of mature virions in a metastable conformation that, when exposed to an appropriate trigger (receptor interactions, acidic pH, or a combination of both), undergoes structural rearrangements to drive the merger of the viral membrane with a membrane of the target cell (reviewed in [3]). In the course of these conformational changes, the fusion proteins expose a segment of the polypeptide chain (\u201cfusion peptide\u201d [FP]) that inserts into the cellular membrane to initiate the fusion process [4].",

Class I proteins, which form trimeric spikes, are found in orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, retroviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses. The class II proteins of flaviviruses and alphaviruses lie tangentially to the viral membrane and form an icosahedral oligomeric network at the virion surface [5,7,8]. A third category of fusion proteins with features of both class I and class II has been recently described for vesicular stomatitis and herpes simplex 1 viruses [9,10].",

A key feature in this context is the formation of a \u201chairpin\u201d-like trimeric postfusion structure, bringing into contact the C-terminal membrane anchor with the target-membrane inserted FP [4,6,11,12]. The available crystal structures of the prefusion and postfusion conformations represent only snapshots at the start and at the end of a process that proceeds through a set of intermediate states [3,4,6,13]. A better understanding of the membrane fusion reaction demands the characterization of the postulated intermediates. Such intermediates have been identified for class I fusion proteins by the use of specific fusion inhibitors [14\u201320], by using modified recombinant forms of the fusion protein [21\u201324], or by the sequential application of different triggers (avian sarcoma and leukosis retroviruses) [19,20,25,26]. In the case of the class II alphavirus fusion protein E1, it was possible to stabilize an intermediate trimeric core by the addition of one of its domains in soluble form, which prevents the formation of the final postfusion hairpin-like structure and thus inhibits fusion [27].",

            "text": "In this work, we use tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus as a model to dissect the class II flavivirus membrane fusion pathway and the associated structural rearrangements of the envelope protein E. We found a monomeric conformation of E that can be postulated as a transient intermediate of the fusion pathway. TBE virus is a member of the flavivirus genus (family Flaviviridae) [28], which encompasses a number of other important human pathogens such as yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Mature flavivirus particles are characterized by an external icosahedral glycoprotein cage formed by 90 dimers of E [29,30] (Figure 1A\u20131D) that completely cover the viral membrane and mediate both receptor-binding and membrane fusion. The crystal structures of the E ectodomain (termed \u201csE\u201d) were determined for TBE and dengue viruses in both their prefusion and postfusion conformations [31\u201336]. In the prefusion form, as shown in Figure 1A and 1B, the three domains of sE are aligned along a rod-like molecule, with the C terminus and the FP lying at the two distal ends of the molecule [31,32,35,36]. In full-length E, the sE segment connects to the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) segments via an element of about 50 amino acids (called \u201cstem\u201d) that contains two \u03b1-helices, H1 and H2, which are peripherally attached to the viral membrane [37] (Figure 1C). The internal FP loop\u2014located at the tip of domain (D)II\u2014is buried at the dimer interface (Figure 1A and 1B). Dissociation of the E dimer into monomers, with concomitant exposure of the FP to allow its interaction with target membranes, occurs by breaking of the intradimeric and interdimeric contacts at the virion surface [38,39] (Figure 1D). Under physiological conditions, this process is triggered by the acidic pH in endosomes during receptor-mediated endocytosis and rapidly followed by E trimerization [40]. The structure of sE in the trimer (Figure 1E) shows that DIII is displaced from its original location and thus becomes positioned at the side of DI with its C terminus pointing toward the FP [33,34] (Figure 1E, 1G, and 1H). This movement results in the formation of a hairpin structure, suggesting that in the full-length postfusion form of E, the TM segments and the FP are juxtaposed in the fused membrane [33,34] (Figure 1F).",

Thus, E dimer dissociation with concomitant glycoprotein cage disassembly, allowing interactions of monomeric pre-hairpin intermediates with target membranes, can be induced without the subsequent E trimerization and completion of the fusion process. The monomeric conformation of E is obtained by exposing TBE virions to alkaline pH instead of the physiological acidic pH. Full fusion, however, can be induced by subsequent exposure to acidic pH, leading to hairpin formation and E trimerization, which drive the merger of the two lipid bilayers. The demonstration of a membrane-inserted prehairpin intermediate has important implications for the existing models of class II viral membrane fusion.",

This is the case for the influenza virus hemagglutinin [41] and the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses [42,43] and retroviruses [44]. With TBE virus, in contrast, similar treatments had no functional effect and led to E protein denaturation only [45]. In a further attempt to identify alternative triggers and structural intermediates of flavivirus fusion, we investigated the effect of alkaline pH on the envelope organization and fusion-related processes of TBE virus. Purified virus samples in a pH 8.0 buffer were exposed to pH 10.0 and 5.4, respectively, solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to rate-zonal centrifugation, in order to compare the oligomeric state of E in these preparations. As expected, solubilization in Triton X-100 yielded E protein dimers at pH 8.0 and trimers at pH 5.4, whereas at pH 10.0, only E monomers were obtained (Figure 2A), indicating that alkaline pH causes a considerable weakening of the interaction forces of the E dimer. This dissociation was fully reversible upon back-neutralization, as revealed by experiments in which (i) the E monomer peak in Figure 2A was back-neutralized in the presence of Triton X-100 and (ii) virions were exposed to alkaline pH, back-neutralized, and solubilized with Triton X-100. In both cases, the analysis by sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed a single peak at the position corresponding to the E dimer (Figure 2B and 2C).",

This indicates that the density of the 180 E molecules in the viral membrane is apparently so high that the probability of the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links is similar, irrespective of the treatment at different pH values. Further conclusions as to the pH-induced changes in viral envelope organization could therefore not be based on this experimental approach.",

Aliquots of the virus preparation were mixed with liposomes at pH 8.0, adjusted to either pH 5.4 or 10.0, and subjected to centrifugation as described in Materials and Methods. Under both conditions, almost all of the E protein was recovered from the top of the gradient, indicating its association with the liposomes (Figure 5A). Further experiments were carried out to more precisely define the alkaline pH dependence of this association. As shown in Figure 5B, association was practically 100% between pH 10.5 and 9.5 but at pH 9.0 reached only about 20% of that observed at pH 5.4.

We therefore assessed whether coflotation could be inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (designated A1), which is specific for the FP loop [38]. Two antibodies reactive with DI (C1) and DIII (B4) were used as controls. The result was similar to that obtained previously at acidic pH [39]; i.e., only the binding of monoclonal antibody A1 resulted in complete blocking of membrane binding (Figure 5C), suggesting that the FP loop is responsible for the interactions with liposomes at both pH values. In earlier studies [39,46], it was shown that the interaction of the FP loop with target membranes at acidic pH could facilitate the formation of trimers with a soluble C-terminally truncated E (sE) that, in the absence of liposomes, only dissociates into its monomeric constituents and does not trimerize. In the case of alkaline pH, however, no evidence for E trimerization induced by virus attachment to liposomes was obtained, and sedimentation analysis in the presence of Triton X-100 revealed only E monomers (unpublished data).",

From these experiments, it can be concluded that the alkaline pH\u2013mediated attachment of E monomers to target membranes leaves the proteins in a state that is still competent for fusion upon acidification. In addition to its fusion activity, the other entry functions of E in virions are apparently preserved or can be completely restored after alkaline pH treatment.

The viral and liposomal membranes are contiguous, and an electron-dense structure (possibly the nucleocapsid) appears to be in the process of being released into the interior of the liposome. These bulky spikes observed throughout the surface of the fusing virion suggest that those E proteins in the particle that cannot contact the target membrane form postfusion trimers and insert their fusion loops into the viral membrane, similar to what has been described for influenza virus [48]. With the alkaline pH\u2013treated samples, on the other hand, only particles attached to, not fused with, liposomal membranes could be detected (Figure 7B).

Their identification was certainly facilitated by the fact that the conformational transitions and concomitantly the class I\u2013mediated fusion process are quite slow (half-life of several minutes) and therefore provides a long window of opportunities for the interaction of inhibitors with structural fusion intermediates [49,50]. The fusion machinery of flaviviruses, in contrast, is extremely fast (half-life of about 2 s) [51], and the trapping of intermediates or the inhibition of fusion by similar principles has not yet been described. As shown in our study, however, it is possible to separate the flavivirus fusion process into two discrete stages by the application of alkaline pH, which triggers only the formation of a prehairpin intermediate and its interaction with target membranes but not hairpin formation and membrane fusion.",

Such \u201copening up\u201d of the cage appears to be caused by simultaneous dissociation of the 90 E dimers that at neutral pH are interlocked in a \u201cherringbone\u201d pattern at the virus surface [29,30] (Figure 1D). As suggested by solubilization and sedimentation analyses and the rough contour of alkaline pH\u2013treated virions in electron micrographs, alkaline pH treatment results in E monomers protruding from the surface and thus exposing their FP loops at the distal tip. Such a pattern is likely to allow an efficient multivalent interaction of the FP with the target membrane. Indeed, the high avidity of the interaction resulting from multiple E protomers is reflected in the capacity of the particles to coflotate with liposomes, whereas the same test using isolated sE dimers exposed to alkaline pH results in no detectable binding to membranes (unpublished data). This difference could be due to the lack of the stem-anchor region in sE, but inhibition studies with an FP-specific monoclonal antibody support the interpretation that the observed virion\u2013liposome interactions at alkaline pH are indeed mediated by the FP loop, analogous to the interactions observed when E dimers dissociate under physiological conditions at acidic pH [39].",

A slight bend between DI and DII is apparently needed in the sE dimer for the FP to fit in a pocket between DI and DIII in the partner subunit (Figure 1A and 1B). Structural studies on the homologous protein from Semliki Forest virus, which has been crystallized as a monomer, suggest that in the \u201crelaxed\u201d form, i.e., in the absence of oligomeric interactions, the molecule forms a straight rod [5,52]. It is therefore likely that the sE segment also forms a straight rod in the monomeric form and that the flexibility at the connection between DIII and H1 (Figure 1C) is sufficient for E to project from the virion surface.",

            "text": "There is experimental evidence that intermediates of the E dimer\u2013trimer transition interact with target membranes [39], but it was not clear whether trimerization can occur before DIII relocation and hairpin formation. Inspection of the postfusion trimer shows that the most important trimer contacts are provided by (i) the AB loop in DI in a conformation that is only generated after displacement of DIII (Figure 1G) and (ii) interactions of the external surface of DI with relocated DIII, which functions as an external clamp for stabilizing the trimer (Figure 1E\u20131H). These structural considerations together with our experimental data thus favor the conclusion that the initial target membrane binding is mediated by multiple copies of monomeric E intermediates in their prehairpin conformation and that DIII relocation and trimerization are concomitant. Although alkaline pH treatment leads to E dimer dissociation and thus generates monomeric intermediates, it apparently does not disrupt the intramolecular DI\u2013DIII interactions required for DIII relocation. Based on the presence of two strictly conserved histidine residues at the DI\u2013DIII contact site (His146 in DI and His323 in DIII), we had postulated previously that protonation of these side chains by acidic pH may be important for the destabilization of the DI\u2013DIII interactions in the protomer [33]. The observed inhibition of dengue virus fusion by soluble DIII present during the low pH treatment [27] can be explained by the fact that exogenous DIII is unconstrained and can bind and stabilize an intermediate form of E before the endogenous DIII can reach its correct location to form a hairpin. In electron micrographs taken at acidic pH, the virus particles display thick knob-like radial projections consistent with the structure of E trimers in their postfusion conformation. This suggests that the E protomers not interacting with the target membrane trimerize and insert their FPs into the viral membrane through the relocation of DIII and concomitant placement of the stem into lateral grooves (as diagrammed in Figure 1F).",

Similarly, trimerization and hairpin formation of the related class II fusion protein E1 of alphaviruses also requires the prior dissociation into a monomeric form, in this case from its heterodimeric partner E2 in mature virions (reviewed in [54]). Experiments in the presence of Zn2+ ions [55] and with FP loop mutants [56] have indeed provided evidence that the interaction of E1 with target membranes\u2014as we have shown for TBE virus E\u2014can occur in the absence of trimer formation, suggesting similar pathways of membrane fusion. Even in the case of class I fusion proteins, in which the oligomeric state is trimeric in both conformations, there are important differences in the trimer interfaces of their prefusion and postfusion forms [57,58], and a putative transient dissociation of the prefusion trimer cannot be ruled out. Further data are obviously needed to test the universality of our observations on flavivirus fusion.",

Pyrene-labeled virions (0.5 to 1 \u03bcM) were mixed with 0.3 mM liposomes at pH 8.0 in a continuously stirred fluorimeter cuvette at 37 \u00b0C, and different pH values were adjusted by the addition of 150 mM CAPS (alkaline pH) and 300 or 600 mM MES (acidic pH). The initial excimer fluorescence after mixing was defined as 0% fusion. To determine the residual excimer fluorescence at infinite dilution of the probe (defined as 100% fusion for calculating the fusion extents), the detergent n-octa(ethylene glycol)-n-dodecyl monoether was added to a final concentration of 10 mM to disperse the viral and liposomal membranes.",

(C) Schematic side view of the E dimer at the surface of mature virions, with the \u201cstem\u201d and TM C-terminal polypeptide segments (missing in the truncated sE form) indicated in green. The viral lipid bilayer is illustrated with lipids belonging to the outer and inner leaflets colored blue and pink, respectively. Cryoelectron microscopy 3D reconstructions have shown that the stem forms two \u03b1-helices (H1 and H2) lying on the viral membrane, followed by the two TM segments [37]. (D) Schematic diagram illustrating the icosahedral arrangement of E dimers at the surface of mature flavivirus particles\u2014in a \u201cherringbone\u201d pattern\u2014as determined for dengue and West Nile virus [29,30]. Ninety E dimers form a rigid glycoprotein cage enclosing the viral membrane. (E) Structure of the TBE virus sE in its trimeric postfusion conformation [33], represented as a ribbon diagram. Compared to the structure of E in the prefusion dimer, DIII is translocated (in a movement indicated by the light-blue arrow) to a lateral position, with its C terminus (labeled C-ter) projecting toward the FPs, thus generating a hairpin-like conformation. (F) Schematic representation illustrating the proposed organization of full-length E in its postfusion conformation. In this model, the \u03b1-helices of the stem interact with the body of the trimer, in the grooves between adjacent, parallel DIIs. The lipid bilayer as well as the stem and TM segments are drawn as in (C). (G) Top view of the sE trimer. For clarity, one of the subunits is colored according to domains, and the other two are given in a single color each (green and gray). The AB loop of DI (labeled in the figure [G]) rearranges upon dislocation of DIII, to make most of the DI\u2013DI trimeric contacts. The relocated DIII acts as an external clamp, inserting into the grooves between DIs and providing additional intersubunit contacts. The vertical 3-fold axis at the center is indicated by a black triangle. (H) Schematic drawing to simplify the top view of the sE trimer, matching the color coding of (G) (except for the subunit in yellow, which corresponds to the one colored by domains in [G]), to highlight the trimer-stabilizing role of DIII in the hairpin-like conformation of the molecule.",
