It is the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century and was caused by a coronavirus termed SARS-CoV. Although now SARS appears to be contained, new coronaviruses have been detected, which may cause great threats to the human health. For example, since the appearance of a new coronavirus termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, it has caused 207 confirmed cases, out of which 84 died (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/index.html). More importantly, so far neither a vaccine nor an efficacious therapy has been available for them. Therefore, it remains highly demanded to develop strategies to design potential therapeutic agents against SARS- and other CoVs.",

The large replicase gene encodes two viral polyproteins, namely pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa), which have to be processed into active subunits for genome replication and transcription by two viral proteases [1], [2], namely the papain-like cysteine protease (PL2pro) and 3C-Like protease (3CLpro), also known as main protease (Mpro). Previously, SARS 3CLpro has been extensively characterized to be a key target for development of antiviral therapies. The coronavirus 3CLpro is so named to reflect the similarity of its catalytic machinery to that of the picornavirus 3C proteases [1]\u2013[3]. Noticeably, both 3C and 3CL-Like proteases utilize the two-domain chymotrypsin fold to host the complete catalytic machinery, which is located in the cleft between domains I and II. Intriguingly, however, in the coronavirus 3CLpro, a \u223c100-residue helical domain was evolutionarily acquired at its C-terminus [1]\u2013[4]. Moreover, unlike 3C protease, only the homodimeric form is catalytically competent for the CoV 3CLpro [1], [4], [5]\u2013[24]. After intense studies, now it has been clear that both chymotrypsin fold and extra domain are critical for dimerization.",

            "text": "We were particularly interested in understanding the role of the extra domain and thus initiated a domain dissection study on SARS 3CLpro immediately after the SARS outbreak in Singapore [6]. The results revealed that although the catalytic fold and extra domain could fold independently, the catalytic fold alone was monomeric and almost inactive. This indicates that the extra domain plays a key role in maintaining the dimerization, thus mediating the catalysis [6]. Therefore, we further conducted a systematic mutagenesis study which led to identification of the extra-domain residues critical for both dimerization and catalysis [16]. Interestingly, we found that the residues important for catalysis and dimerization constitute a nano-channel, which are composed of residues from both catalytic and extra domains [16]. Moreover, we determined the high-resolution structure of R298A, a monomeric mutant triggered by a point mutation on the extra domain, in which the most radical changes have been found within the catalytic machinery [22]. R298A adopts a completely collapsed and inactivated catalytic machinery which is structurally distinguishable from that in wild-type (WT) enzyme; with a short 310-helix formed by residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 within the oxyanion-binding loop [22]. Remarkably, the collapsed catalytic machinery observed in R298A appears to represent a universal inactivated state intrinsic to all inactive enzymes as the same collapsed machinery was found in other monomers triggered by the mutations G11A, N28A and S139A which are all located on the chymotrypsin fold [21], [23], [24]. On the other hand, previously we also identified a mutant N214A, which owns a dramatically abolished activity but only slightly weakened dimerization [16]. Very unexpectedly, our determination of its crystal structure revealed that it still adopts a dimeric structure almost identical to that of the WT protease [25]. Nevertheless, the results with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations up to 30 ns unveiled that the N214A mutation triggers the dynamical instability of the catalytic machinery, with many key residues jumped to sample the conformations characteristic of the collapsed and inactivated state in R298A, thus establishing a dynamically-driven inactivation mechanism for the catalytic machinery of the SARS 3CLpro [25].",

Interestingly, despite being far away from the active pocket, the mutations led to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity but only slightly enhanced dimerization. Here, our determination of its crystal structure reveals that STI/A still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wild-type (WT), only with a slightly change of the extra-domain packing, which is similar to that observed in the more active form of the WT at high pH values (pH 7.6 and 8) [44]. As a consequence, to understand its underlying dynamical mechanism, we conducted 100-ns MD simulations for both WT and STI/A. Remarkably, the most dramatic changes in STI/A simulations are associated with the nano-channel. This change appears to slightly enhance the dynamic stability of the N-finger and helix A, which subsequently relay the dynamic effects to the contacted residues and finally to catalytic machinery. Ultimately, the key components composed of the catalytic machinery become more dynamically stable, thus rationalizing the enhancement of its catalytic activity. As coronavirus 3C-Like proteases share a similar enzymatic mechanism [1], [2], [26], our results would facilitate the development of strategies and agents by modulating protein dynamics to fight new coronaviruses whose outbreaks may occur in the future.",

On the other hand, the SARS 3CLpro we previously studied had two extra residues Gly-Ser after the thrombin cleavage of the GST-3CLp fusion proteins [6], [16]. In order to remove the two extra residues, in the present study we transferred the gene encoding SARS 3CLp from the pGEX-4T-1 GST-fusion expression vector (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) to the His-tagged pET28a vector. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to shorten the thrombin cleavage sequence LVPR|GS (CTG GTT CCG CGT GGA TCC) engineered by the company to LVPR| (CTG GTT CCG CGT), which only constituted the thrombin cleavage site in conjunction with the first two N-terminal residues Ser-Gly of SARS 3CLp. Interestingly, thrombin cleaved this new site (LVPR|SG) very efficiently to release the authentic wild-type 3CLpro as well as N214A [25]. To produce STI/A mutant, site-directed mutagenesis was further used to mutate S284-T285-I286 to Ala as previously described [16], [25]. Benefited from this re-engineered cleavage site, we were able to produce both authentic WT 3CLpro [25] and its STI/A mutant without any extra residues from the fusion tag.",

MutInf represents an entropy-based approach to analyze ensembles of protein conformers, such as those from molecular dynamics simulations by using internal coordinates and focusing on dihedral angles. In particular, this approach is even applicable in cases for which conformational changes are subtle, for example, because the coupling is mostly entropic in nature [39]. Briefly, this approach utilizes second-order terms from the configurational entropy expansion, called the mutual information, to identify pairs of residues with correlated conformations, or correlated motions, in an equilibrium ensemble [39]. In the present study, the normalized matrix values were used, and 0.3 was set up to be the threshold value to determine the pairs of highly correlated residues.

Here we further measured the Kd value of the STI/A dimerization by ITC to be 13.4 \u00b5M (Figure 1b), only slightly smaller than 21.4 \u00b5M for the authentic WT protease [25], indicating that the STI/A mutation only has a very small enhancement of the dimerization.",

The dimeric STI/A structure is highly similar to those of the WT protease previously reported (Figure 2a). If compared to the WT crystal structure (2H2Z) [18] also determined at pH 6.0, with the authentic sequence in the same C2 space group [18], the dimeric RMS deviations are 0.86 and 0.77 \u00c5 respectively for the heavy (C, O, S and N) and backbone atoms (C, C\u03b1, N (backbone-amide), carbonyl). Even if comparing at the individual protomer level, the RMS deviations reduce to 0.55 and 0.49 \u00c5 respectively for the heavy and backbone atoms, implying that the packing of two protomers slightly differs in the STI/A proteases. In the STI/A mutant, even for the key residues constituting the catalytic machinery including the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, oxyanion-loop Phe140-Cys145, His163 and Glu166 critical for binding substrates; and Phe140, His172 in holding the substrate binding-pocket open, their backbones and side-chains are almost superimposable to those in the WT structure (Figure 2b). This observation implies that the enhancement of the STI/A activity cannot be readily rationalized only by the static structure. Furthermore, the mutation residues Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 are located on the extra domain and far away from the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 (Figure 1c). We also examined the B-factors of STI/A and WT proteases but it appears extremely challenging to establish any precise correlation between the B-factors and catalytic activity. Therefore, the catalytic enhancement is most likely due to the change of the protein dynamics of the enzyme induced by the mutations as we previously demonstrated on the N214A mutant [25].",

Strikingly, upon pH changes, the extra domains in the dimeric enzyme appear to undergo a \u2018rigid body rotation/movement\u2019. Inspired by this, here we calculated the distances (d) between the centers of mass of two extra domains, as well as the angles (\u0398) formed by two mass centers of each extra domains and the mass center of the two catalytic folds together (Figure 2c), which are 32.4 \u00c5 and 63.2 degree for the STI/A determined here at pH 6.0 (3EA7), 33.7 \u00c5 and 66.3 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 6.0 (2H2Z) [18], 32.6 \u00c5 and 63.3 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.6 (1UK3), and 32.7 \u00c5 and 63.7 degree for the wild-type enzyme at pH 8.0 (1UK2).

Interestingly, in the context of the dimeric forms, STI/A showed larger overall RMSD than WT, with average RMSD values over 100-ns simulations of 2.64\u00b10.32, 1.90\u00b10.26 and 2.68\u00b10.42 \u00c5 for three separate simulations of STI/A; and 1.60\u00b10.26, 1.66\u00b10.31 and 1.63\u00b10.25 \u00c5 for three simulations of WT. However, the averaged C\u03b1 RMSD values of the chymotrypsin folds (Domain I and II) of STI/A are only slightly larger than those of WT (Figures 3d-3f), with average RMSD values over 100-ns simulations of 1.40\u00b10.21, 1.20\u00b10.16 and 1.44\u00b10.26 \u00c5 for three simulations of STI/A; and of 1.28\u00b10.16, 1.17\u00b10.17 and 1.25\u00b10.15 \u00c5 for three simulations of WT. On the other hand, the extra domains of STI/A have dramatically higher fluctuations than WT in simulations as indicated by its higher RMSD values (Figures 3g-3i), with average RMSD values over 100-ns simulations of 3.57\u00b10.54, 2.19\u00b10.53 and 3.26\u00b10.86 \u00c5 for three simulations of STI/A and of 1.75\u00b10.51, 1.62\u00b10.31 and 1.61\u00b10.31 \u00c5 for three simulations of WT. These results clearly demonstrate that the larger RMSD values for the dimeric STI/A are mostly resulting from the motions of the extra domains.

Interestingly, although the STI/A mutations are on the extra domain, only limited intra-domain hydrogen bonds show significant occupancy differences within the extra domain (Table 1). This suggests that similar to the tighter packing between two extra domains triggered by the high pH in WT [44], here the tighter packing induced by the STI/A mutations is also largely resulting from the \u2018rigid body rotation/movement\u2019 of the extra domains without significantly affecting the packing within the extra domains. Furthermore, the slight dynamic changes over the extra domains can also be transmitted to the catalytic fold, as exemplified by the significant changes of hydrogen bond occupancies between Asp295 and Thr111 (Table 1).",

Furthermore, all previous MD simulations revealed that the dynamic stability of this distance is extremely critical for the stable formation of a hydrogen bond, which appears to be pivotal for maintaining the catalytic competency of the SARS 3CLpro [10], [23], [25], [51]\u2013[53]. Also for the active WT enzyme, this distance has been previously demonstrated to be dynamically stable in MD simulations. Indeed, as in our previous simulations, the distances of both protomers of the WT were found to be dynamically stable for all 30 ns while those of the inactive N214A mutant became unstable and larger despite sharing a superimposable crystal structure to the WT [25]. In our current MD simulations of 100 ns, the distances between NE2 of His41 and SG of Cys145 of STI/A are: 3.80\u00b10.60 \u00c5, 3.91\u00b10.51 and 3.78\u00b10.50 \u00c5 respectively for three simulations of the protomer 1 (Figures 5a-5c), and 3.91\u00b10.48, 3.87\u00b10.45 and 3.86\u00b10.48 \u00c5 respectively for the protomer 2 (Figures 5d-5f). In contrast, the distances in WT are: 3.82\u00b10.46, 3.83\u00b10.49 and 4.07\u00b10.76 \u00c5 respectively for three simulations of the protomer 1, and 4.08\u00b10.52, 3.84\u00b10.49 and 3.89\u00b10.43 \u00c5 respectively for the protomer 2. As a consequence, the distance of STI/A ranges from 3.78 to 3.91 \u00c5 while WT from 3.82 to 4.08 \u00c5, suggesting that overall this distance is more dynamically stable in STI than that in WT. In particular, after 80 ns, in simulation 3 of the WT protomer 1, this distance becomes largely fluctuating (Figure 5c), while for STI/A, no such large fluctuation can be observed for all 100 ns. The Chi2 angles of His41 have similar dynamical behaviors (Figures 5g-5l) and the large fluctuation is also observed (Figure 5i).",

The S1 substrate site is the most critical as it confers an absolute specificity for a Gln at the P1 position of the substrate. As such, maintaining the intact conformation of S1 substrate site is especially vital for catalysis. Briefly, the S1 substrate site can be divided into four parts: the oxyanion hole; His163; Glu166; Phe140 and its stabilizing elements [1], [2], [4], [23], [25]. The oxyanion hole refers to a structural element to donate two hydrogen bonds from main-chain amides of Gly-143 and Cys-145 to accommodate the main-chain oxygen of Gln-P1 as well as the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis. Previously we demonstrated that in the inactive monomer R298A, the most distinguishable change is the collapse of the oxyanion hole as triggered by the chameleon formation of a short 310-helix from a loop over residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 [22]. Remarkably, in our previous MD simulations, residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 of the WT maintained an extended active conformation while those of N214A frequently jumped to sample the 310-helix conformation characteristic of the collapsed oxyanion hole [25].",

The Leu-P2 substrate binding site consists of Thr25, Leu27, Val42, Cys44, Thr47, Asp48, Met49, Tyr54, Leu164, and Met165 and these residues form a hydrophobic pocket that is receptive to a bulky side-chain such as Leu, Phe and Val [52]. Studies indicated that the physical dimensions or/and specific conformation of Leu-P2 substrate site determined both substrate binding specificity and consequentially the enzymatic catalytic rate. Thr25 and Cys44 lie at the edge of the Leu-P2 substrate binding site. The backbone and side-chain conformations of Cys44 are largely similar in both STI/A and WT simulations. Interestingly Thr25 shows a slightly enhanced dynamical stability of the backbone (Figures 8a-8l). Furthermore, the distance (Figures 8m-8r) and volume enclosed (Figures 8s-8x) between Thr25 and Cys44 have enhanced dynamical stability profiles in STI/A simulation: the averaged distance between Thr25/OG1 and Cys44/O is: 2.87\u00b10.36 \u00c5 (protomer 1), 3.05\u00b10.54 \u00c5 (protomer 2) for STI/A; and 3.63\u00b10.92 \u00c5 (protomer 1), 3.40\u00b11.00 \u00c5 (protomer 1) for WT. On the other hand, there is an approximate 2-fold increase in hydrogen bond occupancy between Thr25/OG1 and Cys44/O in STI/A simulations (Table 1). The significant fluctuations of the distance and volume between Thr25 and Cys44 in WT may result in an increased insertion of the methyl moiety of Thr25 side-chain into the cavity of Leu-P2 substrate site, thus impeding the docking of substrate into the substrate pocket or reduce the enzyme grip on the substrate during enzymatic catalysis.",

First, the linker residues connecting the catalytic and extra domains have reduced hydrogen bond occupancies, which come from the rearrangement of the orientation between the catalytic and extra domains via \u2018rigid body rotation/movement\u2019 in SIT/A. Second, in STI/A simulations, except for the hydrogen bonds of Gln19-Asn119 and Thr21-Thr25 which have reduced occupancies, hydrogen bonds of other catalytic fold residues have significantly increased occupancies. These observations clearly indicate that the effects triggered by the STI/A mutations can be indeed transmitted to the catalytic fold and enhance the dynamic stability of the catalytic machinery, which ultimately leads to the increased catalytic activity of the STI/A mutant.",

            "text": "Strikingly, although the N214A mutation significantly provoked the dynamics of the whole protease [25], the mutual information profiles reveal that it globally decouples the correlation of the paired residue motions (Figure 9). As a consequence, the first half of the catalytic fold which hosts His41, one of the catalytic dyad residues, loses the significant correlation to the rest of the protease in both protomers. The results on the correlation analysis of both WT and N214A strongly suggest that the networks to correlate the motions over the whole protease are essential for implementing its catalytic action, and the dynamic perturbation onto a key component even without detectable conformational change is sufficient to dramatically inactivate the catalytic machinery by disrupting the correlation network. On the other hand, for STI/A, the difference of the mutual information profiles between STI/A and WT is relatively small. In the protomer 1 of STI/A, although the correlated motions of some pairs of residues become less significant as compare to those in WT, the correlated motions become significantly increased for residues Gly2-Arg4 with many other residues distributed over the whole protease. In the second protomer of STI/A, the correlated motions over the majority of the residue pairs become enhanced as compared to those of WT. As such, it is not straightforward to attribute these changes to the activity enhancement in STI/A. It appears that unlike the N214A mutation which decouples the global correlated motions, thus inactivating the catalytic machinery, the STI/A mutation enhances the catalytic activity by the specific allosteric pathways which manifest as the altered correlation patterns.",

The SARS 3CLpro not only represents a promising target for developing therapeutic agents, but also serves as an excellent model for understanding how the evolutionarily-acquired non-catalytic domains mediate the enzymatic mechanisms. Previously, it has been found that by acquiring additional non-catalytic domains during evolution, many enzymes gain altered catalytic mechanisms or/and be connected to cellular signaling networks [55]\u2013[56]. Indeed, upon acquiring the C-terminal extra domain, SARS 3CLpro suddenly needs the dimerization to activate its catalytic machinery. Previous studies have uncovered that the monomeric structures of the SARS 3CLpro have the same collapsed catalytic machinery, regardless of being triggered by G11A, N28A or S139A mutations on the catalytic domains [21], [23], [24], or by R298A on the extra domain [22]. This suggests that the dimerization is commonly controlled by a structurally-allosteric network composed of residues of both catalytic and extra domains. With MD simulations, we have shown that the collapsed catalytic machinery was not only structurally-distinguishable from, but also dynamically well-separated from the activated state of SARS 3CLpro [25]. Remarkably, despite having almost the same three-dimensional structure as WT, in MD simulations, the dimeric but inactive N214A mutant frequently jumped to sample the conformations of the collapsed state, thus leading to the proposal of the \u201cdynamically-driven inactivation\u201d for the catalytic machinery of SARS 3CLpro [25]. This observation implies that the mutation effect of N214A has been relayed to inactivating the catalytic machinery through the dynamic allostery.",

            "text": "Here we studied another mutant STI/A with mutations on the extra domain, which has a significantly-increased activity but only slightly-enhanced dimerization. The successful determination of its crystal structure indicates that STI/A still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of WT, only with slightly tighter packing between two extra-domains due to the cavity created from replacing Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 with Ala (Figure 2a). In particular, the key residues constituting the catalytic machinery are almost superimposable to those of WT (Figure 2b). We thus hypothesized that the activity enhancement may be mostly resulting from the dynamic allostery, as we previously observed in the N214A mutant [25]. Consequently we conducted 100-ns MD simulations for both STI/A and WT, which represent the longest simulations reported for 3CLpro so far. An exhaustive analysis of MD results revealed that STI/A and WT have very similar dynamical behaviors for most residues. Nevertheless, in the MD simulations, STI/A did show some dynamical behaviors different from those in WT. The most significant change in STI/A is that in the simulations the two extra domains became further tightly packed in STI/A, mostly driven by the hydrophobic interactions by Ala284-Ala285-Ala286-Leu287. This led to a dramatic reduction of the volume of a nano-channel constituted by residues of both catalytic and extra domains (Figures 10a-10e), which we previously proposed to relay the perturbation on the extra domains to the catalytic machinery [16]. The volume reduction in the nano-channel triggered slight changes of dynamics of some nano-channel residues (Figure 10f), in particular the N-finger residues (Figure S3), which are also reflected by the redistribution of the hydrogen bond occupancy (Table 1). Interestingly the Helix A residues also become slightly more stable as evident from their backbone conformations (Figure S4) and increased hydrogen-bond occupancy for the residues Ser10 and Gly11 (Table 1). The dynamic changes over N-finger and helix A appears to be further transmitted to residues over the BII and CII beta-strands including Thr111, Ser113, Leu115-Tyr118 and Ser123 (Figure 10f), which ultimately lead to the enhanced dynamic stability of residues constituting the catalytic machinery, such as Asn28, Thr25 and Cys45; Glu166 and His172; as well as the catalytic dyad His41-145. The enhanced dynamical stability of these residues appears to be responsible for the increased activity of STI/A. Indeed, previously high catalytic activity of some enzymes has been correlated with their high stability [57]\u2013[59] and in particular, a lipase mutant with higher catalytic activity has been characterized to have active sites of higher dynamical rigidity by both MD simulation and experimental studies [59].",

For example, the N-finger [20], Gly11 [23] and Asn28 [21] residues are particularly important and mutation/deletion of them has been shown to abolish the dimeric structures. This implies the existence of a correlated interaction network, which is constituted by interactions of residues of both catalytic and extra domains [21], [22]. Indeed, our correlation analysis by MutInf [39] reveals that such a global network of the correlated motions does exist in the WT protease, whose components include all residues identified to be critical for its dimerization and catalysis previously as well as in the current study (Figure 10). Most remarkably, the N214A mutation appears to inactivate the catalytic machinery at least partly by decoupling the correlation of the network components while the STI/A mutation enhance the activity by altering the correlation pattern. Indeed, the inactive N214A mutant does have a slightly weakened dimerization [25] while the more active STI/A mutant has a slightly enhanced dimerization, which strongly supports the proposal that the specific structured crowding can have significant effects on enzymatic catalysis through mediating protein dynamics and their correlations [49].",

To the best of our knowledge, the SARS 3CLpro appears to be the first example that without having significant structural change over the active pocket, the mutation perturbations on the evolutionarily-acquired non-catalytic domain can be relayed by the dynamic allostery into manifesting opposite catalytic effects: inactivation of catalysis in N214A and enhancement in STI/A.
