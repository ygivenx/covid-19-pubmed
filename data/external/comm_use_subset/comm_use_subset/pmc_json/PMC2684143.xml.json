However, as evolutionary distance increases between two homologous molecules, their similarity may decay to the point where they are no longer alignable. Construction of a phylogenetic tree under such circumstances becomes impossible. One method that has been suggested for the study of distant evolutionary relationships is that of genomic signatures or genome signatures\u2020 (Karlin and Ladunga, 1994; Karlin and Burge, 1995; Karlin and Mrazek, 1996). At least one reviewer has come to the conclusion that it is the preferred method in cases where evolutionary distance, recombination, horizontal transmission or variable mutation rates may confound traditional alignment-based techniques (Brocchieri, 2001).",

            "text": "As long DNA sequences began to be isolated and computers entered the biological laboratory, it became a simple matter to produce nearest-neighbour frequency tables. Indeed, for any DNA sequence of length N, it is theoretically possible to derive frequency tables for all k-mers ranging from 1 to N, within that sequence. The frequency table at k = 1 corresponds to the raw nucleotide content on one strand. On the assumption that DNA is double stranded under most circumstances in most species, the complementary bases are also scored. This reduces the raw count of the four bases to a single value, between zero and one, representing the GC content of that DNA sequence. Correspondingly, at k = 2, the raw count of 16 dinucleotide frequencies, can be reduced to a vector containing 10 values if the count for each dimer on the top strand is added to the count for its complement on the other strand. There are 10 values, not 8, in this vector since GC, CG, AT and TA are self-complementary. This process is called symmetrization (Karlin and Ladunga, 1994). The symmetrized values in the vector are then usually corrected for the frequencies of their component monomers, as follows:\n\u03c1XY = fXY/fXfYwhere fXY is the symmetrized frequency of dinucleotide XY, and fX and fY are the symmetrized frequencies of bases X and Y, respectively. The whole vector is referred to as the genome signature at k = 2 or, particularly in the extensive literature of the Karlin group, simply as \u03c1* XY. For all values of k, the nomenclature GS-k is here adopted.",

In practice, most investigators have confined themselves to the study of genome signatures of k = 2, in other words to \u03c1 *XY, symmetrized dinucleotide frequencies corresponding to general schemes, although in recent years the availability of faster computers has undoubtedly contributed to the increasing use of genome signatures up to k = 10 (Deschavanne et al. 1999; Edwards et al. 2002; Abe et al. 2003a; Sandberg et al. 2003; Campanaro et al. 2005; Dufraigne et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005; Paz et al. 2006).",

However, recent work has established that genome signatures within species may be stable over lengths as short as 10 kb (Deschavanne et al. 1999; Karlin, 2001; Abe et al. 2002) or less (Sandberg et al. 2001; Jernigan and Baran, 2002; Abe et al. 2003a; Sandberg et al. 2003; McHardy et al. 2007). This has led to their practical application in the detection of pathenogenicity islands (pIs) in pathogenic bacteria. These are sequences originating in horizontal transmission from one bacterium to another, converting a previously innocuous strain into a pathogenic one. Their foreign origin is often reflected in a genome signature closer to their species of origin than their current host genome (Karlin, 1998; Karlin, 2001; Dufraigne et al. 2005).",

(1999) suggested that archaea do not form a coherent clade. Karlin (1998) posited a wide variety of further revisions of the prokaryotic phylogeny based on genome signature results, as well as a novel origin for mitochondria (Karlin et al. 1999). Edwards et al. (2002) used genome signatures as part of a revision of the phylogeny of birds. Nevertheless, few authors have felt confident enough to draw phylogenetic trees based on genome signature comparisons. Coenye and Vandamme (2004) have shown that dinucleotide content is only a reliable indicator of relatedness for closely related organisms. To visualize genome signature relationships between species, a variety of other representational schemes have been used including histograms (Karlin and Mr\u00e1zek, 1997), partial ordering graphs (Karlin et al. 1997), chaos games (Deschavanne et al. 1999; Edwards et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2005), and self-organizing maps (Abe et al. 2003b).",

            "text": "This paper uses self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a tool to explore genome signature variability at phylogenetic levels from superkingdom down to genus. The SOM is a neural network method which spreads multi-dimensional data onto a two-dimensional surface (Kohonen, 1997). Its endpoint is therefore similar to multi-dimensional scaling or principal components analysis, and like these other techniques has been extensively used in biology, principally for the analysis of micro-array data but also to a lesser extent for sequence analysis (Arrigo et al. 1991; Giuliano et al. 1993; Andrade et al. 1997; Tamayo et al. 1999; Kanaya et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2001; Abe et al. 2002; Covell et al. 2003; Ressom et al. 2003; Xiao et al. 2003; Mahony et al. 2004; Oja et al. 2005; Abe et al. 2006; Samsonova et al. 2006). The resulting \u201cflat\u201d representation may be a strong aid to intuitive understanding of the structure of complex multidimensional datasets. The SOM is not a clustering technique per se, but the surface may be divided up into zones that are then treated as clusters. Alternatively, cluster boundaries on the surface may be defined more objectively using additional algorithms (Ultsch, 1993). The SOM is also not hierarchical (unlike UPGMA but like K-means clustering, two other commonly used techniques for the analysis of microarrays). This absence of hierarchy means that it is particularly suited to situations where the natural hierarchy of species relationships, reflecting evolutionary descent, may have been violated, e.g. by horizontal gene transfer.",

New values of \u03b1,\u03c4 and \u211c are then calculated, and the second iteration can commence. It can be intuitively grasped that there is a great deal of \u201cchurn\u201d in initial iterations of the SOM. When \u03b1 is close to 1, data vectors will effectively change their winning weight vector to copies of themselves. Only at the limits of the trained area R will the effect be subtler. However, as the number of iterations mounts, \u03b1 will decrease and each data vector will have a relatively weaker effect on its winning weight vector and even less on those weight vectors in its vicinity. Observation (data not shown) of distribution of a simple data set over a SOM through the iterative process shows that a relatively chaotic process dominates until approximately halfway through the nominated number of iterations, at which point structure rapidly builds in the SOM. The final 10% or so of iterations consist mostly of fine-tuning of the final weight vector values. Training SOMs can also be time consuming, especially for large data sets of high dimensionality vectors trained over large numbers of iterations. The longest run presented here (that in Fig. 2) took in excess of 3 weeks on a single 2.8 GHz Intel processor under a Linux operating system. One of the major motivations of this paper was to define ways to reduce SOM training time without losing accuracy or sensitivity.",

The GS-3 SOM was also run on a 20 \u00d7 20 map, but again this produces no major change to the overall pattern. In all cases, ostreid herpesvirus and ictalurivirus have coherent dominance areas on the SOM. At GS-5, alpha herpes-viruses also have a coherent dominance area, but this disappears again at GS-6. In order to further investigate this apparent lack of improvement at higher values of k, the density of sequences of each family was plotted onto the SOM (Fig. 5). Instead of the dominance map approach, in which each cell is colored according to the affiliation of its cnn (Fig. 1\u20134 are all of this type), cells in which more than 95% of allocated sequences are of a single type are colored red, and those with fewer than 5% of that type are white.

Genome signatures and SOMs were constructed as appropriate using one half. Then the remaining half was applied to the SOM to predict their origin at the family and genus level. To make a prediction concerning the origin of a data vector, the Euclidean distances between that vector and all of the weight vectors of the preconstructed SOM, are calculated. The origin of the nearest weight vector is taken to be the classification of the data vector being tested.

Various studies in a wide range of species have revealed that genome signatures are generally constant within genomes and similar in related genomes (Karlin and Ladunga, 1994; Karlin et al. 1998; Gentles and Karlin, 2001). The extent to which this is a phenomenon of neutral drift or one of active conservation is unknown. It is intuitively obvious that two identical genomes will have identical genome signatures, and that as they diverge the genome signatures will also diverge. Indeed this is the basis of a least one bioinformatical tool that assesses sequence relatedness (Li et al. 2001; Li et al. 2002). However, various suggestions have been made for conservative selection pressures which would act to maintain genome signature similarity in related organisms, including dinucleotide stacking energies, curvature, methylation, superhelicity, context-dependent mutation biases and effects deriving from related replication machinery (Karlin and Burge, 1995; Blaisdell et al. 1996). If these factors are similar within a clade, they might act as a brake on genome signature divergence. The conservation of genome signatures within genomes (which is what originally gave rise to the term \u201csignature\u201d in this context) would tend to suggest that signatures do not drift neutrally, at least within genomes.",
