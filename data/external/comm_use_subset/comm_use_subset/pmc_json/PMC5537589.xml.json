We next aligned these sequences with those in the E proteins of other flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus (YFV) and West Nile virus. We found that the sequence in this region is highly conserved among flaviviruses with amino-acid sequence conservation of 64 to 82% (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1), implying that this region may play important roles in flavivirus infection. Finally, we located this region in the 3.8 \u00c5 resolution cryo-electron microscope structure of ZIKV (Protein Data Bank: 5IRE)30, as shown in pink in Fig. 1b, and it was confirmed as the membrane-proximal stem region of ZIKV E protein (residues 421\u2013453), and this was then used as the basis for the design and synthesis of peptide Z2 and the scrambled peptide of Z2 (Z2-scr).",

It was reported that ZIKV infection of these cells resulted in obvious cytopathic effects (CPE)34. Using this assay, we tested the inhibitory activity of Z2 at different concentrations on infection of ZIKV strain SZ01. We found that Z2 inhibited ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 1.75\u00b10.13 \u03bcM (mean\u00b1s.d., n=3) in BHK21 cells (Fig. 2a) and 3.69\u00b10.27 \u03bcM (n=3) in Vero cells (Fig. 2b), while Z2-scr as a negative control showed no significant inhibition on ZIKV infection. We also used the plaque reduction assay and BHK21 cells to test anti-ZIKV activity. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, the IC50 value is 2.61\u00b10.46 \u03bcM (n=3), suggesting that the result derived from the plaque reduction assay is consistent with that obtained from colorimetric CCK8 assay. The ZIKV-induced CPE in BHK21 and Vero cells were visibly reduced by Z2 at 5 \u03bcM, while Z2-scr at the same concentration exhibited no inhibitory activity (Fig. 2c). In line with the data from CCK8 assay, the result from immunofluorescence staining showed that Z2 at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM almost completely blocked ZIKV E protein expression in BHK21 and Vero cells (Fig. 2d). We then evaluated the antiviral activity of Z2 against other ZIKV strains. As shown in Table 1, Z2 was also effective in inhibiting infection of ZIKV strains FLR and MR766 in BHK21 cells with IC50 values of about 4 and 14 \u03bcM, respectively, suggesting that Z2 possesses broad inhibitory activity against ZIKV strains isolated from patients or rhesus monkeys in different regions of the world.",

Following this, we investigated whether Z2 could also inhibit infection by other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as DENV and YFV. We found that Z2 was also highly effective in inhibiting infection by DENV-2 and YFV 17D (Fig. 2e) with IC50 values of about 4 and 5 \u03bcM, respectively, while it had no inhibition on infection by pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Fig. 2f).

Using similar approaches, we investigated whether Z2 could interact with ZIKV E protein and induce the release of RNA genome from ZIKV virions. First, we used an immunofluorescence staining assay to show that 293T cells transfected by pcDNA3.1-Env could be bound by 4G2, a mouse mAb against E protein of pan-flaviviruses35. Meanwhile, the 293T cells transfected by the empty vector pcDNA3.1 showed no binding, suggesting that ZIKV E protein did express on the 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-Env (Fig. 3a). Using a flow cytometric analysis, we demonstrated that the 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-Env could be stained by Z2-Cy5, whereas the 293T cells expressing no E protein showed only background staining (Fig. 3b). Similar results were obtained from experiment using ZIKV-infected BHK21 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicate that Z2 is able to interact with E protein of ZIKV.",

As shown in Fig. 3c,d, the genomic RNA of untreated virions (0 \u03bcM Z2) or treated by Z2-scr were protected from digestion of micrococcal nuclease. However, the genomic RNA of Z2 treated virions was digested by micrococcal nuclease in a dose-responsive manner. About 70% genomic RNA of ZIKV virions treated with 50 \u03bcM Z2 was digested by micrococcal nuclease. To further confirm the release of viral genomic RNA, ZIKV virions treated with 1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 100 \u03bcM Z2 or Z2-scr in 1% DMSO, and 1% Triton X-100, respectively, was centrifuged through a sucrose density gradient as previously described28. Then the amount of genomic RNA and E protein of ZIKV in each fraction was monitored by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT\u2013qPCR) and western blot (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6), respectively, and the data of western blot was further analysed by Image J software. As shown in Fig. 3e, the genomic RNA and E protein of virions treated by 1% DMSO or Z2-scr migrated to the same fractions. For example, the peaks of both genomic RNA and E protein were located at fraction No. 6, suggesting that virions treated by 1% DMSO or Z2-scr maintained intact. However, the genomic RNA and E protein of virions treated by 1% Triton X-100 migrated to different fractions, that is, peaks of genomic RNA and E protein were in fraction No. 1 and 7, respectively, indicating that virions were completely destroyed by Triton X-100. Interestingly, the peaks of genomic RNA and E protein of virions treated with Z2 were located in fraction No. 6 and 3, respectively. These results indicate that Z2 treatment may cause pore formation in the viral membrane, resulting in the release of viral genomic RNA through the pores.",

Therefore, an effective anti-ZIKV drug should have the ability to penetrate through the placental barrier of the infected pregnant women to protect the fetus. Here we investigate whether Z2 can enter into the pregnant mouse\u2019s organs, and penetrate through its placenta to enter into the fetus\u2019 body. As shown in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a,b, the fluorescent signals of Z2-Cy5 were shown at the sites where the liver and bladder were located and the dissected organs, such as liver, kidney, spleen and heart, suggesting that Z2 is able to enter into blood circulation and organs of pregnant mice. The average radiant efficiency (p s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121)(\u03bcW\u22121 cm2) in the liver (P=0.0275, Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test) and bladder (P=0.0426, Student\u2019s two-tailed t test) of the Z2-treated mice was significantly higher than that in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated mice (Fig. 4b). Then the uteruses of the pregnant mice and the fetuses in their uteruses were removed out for evaluating the distribution of Z2-Cy5. As speculated, the signal of Z2-Cy5 was seen in the uteruses (Fig. 4c) and the fetuses (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 9c). The average radiant efficiency in uteruses (P=0.0148, Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test) and fetuses (P<0.0001, Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test) from the Z2-Cy5 group was significantly higher than that from PBS group (Fig. 4e). In corroboration with the data in Supplementary Fig. 10, these results suggest that Z2 peptide injected intravenously or intraperitoneally (i.p.) can penetrate through the placental barrier of pregnant ICR mice and enter into the bodies of fetuses.",

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured Z2-specific antibodies in sera of pregnant mice at 1 or 2 weeks after the third injection of Z2 or PBS, and found that Z2-specific antibodies in both Z2- and PBS-treated mice were at a level below detection (Supplementary Fig. 11).

The results showed that Z2 treatment could reduce viraemia in ZIKV-infected pregnant C57BL/6 mice (P=0.0141, Mann\u2013Whitney test; Fig. 6a).

In contrast, treatment with Z2 protected 75% of the A129 mice from death caused by ZIKV infection, and the survivors had no neurological symptoms. Z2 treatment also significantly prolonged mean survival time (MST) from 9 days to the end of the experiment (P=0.0010, log-rank (Mantel Cox) test).

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these peptides has been reported to be effective against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo, or be further developed in preclinical and clinical studies. Here we showed that peptide Z2 derived from the stem region of ZIKV E protein is highly effective in inhibiting in vitro infection of ZIKV, both in BHK21 and Vero cells, and other flaviviruses, such as DENV-2 and YFV 17D. Most importantly, intraperitoneal administration of Z2 protected pregnant C57BL/6 mice against vertical transmission of ZIKV and protected A129 or AG6 mice, which are very susceptible to ZIKV infection, against lethal ZIKV challenge. The mechanism by which a peptide derived from the stem region of a flavivirus can inhibit infection by a broad spectrum of flaviviruses remains a point of controversy. It was reported that DN59, a 33-mer peptide that mimics a fragment of stem region of DENV E protein, acts like a disrupter of the DENV membrane, possibly inducing hole formation, leading to release of the viral genome28. Similarly, we found that Z2 peptide could bind to the E protein of ZIKV and disrupt the integrity of ZIKV membrane, resulting in the inactivation of virions. However, no detailed molecular mechanism or signalling pathway has so far been elucidated that would explain how Z2 binds E protein and disrupts the viral cell membrane. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions4344 or viral capsid dynamic studies4546 may explain the possible mechanism, but this investigation is beyond the scope of the present paper.",

The low toxicity in vitro and in vivo of Z2 ensures the safety of Z2 for pregnant women and their fetuses. Protease inhibitors, on the other hand, will not work until the virus enters into the cells, which, in turn, may allow more influx of virions to fetuses. Without the specificity against ZIKV, protease inhibitors may cause harmful effect to high-risk pregnant women. Therefore, combinational use of Z2 with a protease inhibitor for treatment of ZIKV infection may have synergistic effect, resulting in the reduction of dose, and thus the toxicity of the protease inhibitor.",
