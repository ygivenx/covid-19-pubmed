The major proteins of this fluid are the caseins. The caseins are serine rich phosphoproteins which are almost exclusively expressed in the lactating mammary gland [1], [2]. In cows the casein proteins together constitute up to 80% of total milk protein and also 80% of total mRNA in the lactating mammary gland [3]. The caseins are members of a large family of serine rich phospho-proteins, which are clustered on chromosome 5 in the mouse (chromosome 6 in cattle, chromosome 4 in humans). There are 5 functional casein genes in the mouse whereas most other species (including ruminants) only express 3 or 4 functional genes [1]. The casein proteins show little homology with each other outside their signal peptide domain [2], [4].",

            "text": "Inactivation of the \u03b2-casein gene has shown to have little effect on milk secretion and growth of the offspring in the mouse [5]. In contrast, deletion of the \u03ba-casein gene in mice completely abrogates milk production [6]. Exactly why this happens is unclear as neither the structure of the individual casein proteins nor the structure of the casein micelles is currently known in detail [7], [8], [9]. The available results, however, support a model in which \u03ba-casein (the casein protein which is present in milk in least abundance) plays a critical role in ensuring transport and solubility of casein micelles [7]. The sequences of \u03b1- (\u03b1S1 in ruminants) \u03b2-, and \u03b3-casein (\u03b1S2-casein in ruminants) contain one or more clusters of phosphorylated residues known as phosphate centres. Phosphate centres can sequester amorphous calcium phosphate, probably in the Golgi vesicles of mammary secretory cells, to form thermodynamically stable complexes of defined chemical composition which are then secreted through the apical membrane of the mammary epithelial cells [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Milk, like many other biological fluids, is supersaturated with respect to the crystalline mineral of bones and teeth (apatite) but due to the sequestration reaction, is under-saturated with respect to amorphous calcium phosphate. Since apatite only forms by maturation of the amorphous phase of calcium phosphate, it cannot form at all from milk and this helps to protect the mammary gland against soft tissue mineralization [15]. In most milks, the majority of the total calcium is sequestered within the casein micelles. In milks of different species, the total calcium and total casein concentrations are highly correlated [16] and provided this balance is maintained, the milks remain stable. If there is insufficient casein to sequester the secreted calcium and orthophosphate then the milk becomes unstable [15]. In mouse milk, 3 of the phosphate centres are in present \u03b1-casein and only one in \u03b2-casein. Thus the loss of \u03b1-casein is likely to have more serious consequences for milk stability than the loss of \u03b2-casein.",

The offspring of 3(wt females were fostered onto 3 (-casein deficient females and vice versa on day 2 (Table 2), the cross fostered litters being matched for day of birth. The pups were weaned on day 23 by separating them from the nursing female and placing them in cages as described above with same-sex litter mates. From weaning until the age of 6 weeks, water-soaked diet was provided ad libitum in Petri dishes on the cage to weaned pups in all groups to facilitate solid food intake by growth impaired animals.",

To induce apoptosis the cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M staurosporin for 6 h. Cytoplasmic extracts for the analysis of caspase activity were prepared as described in section \u201cmilk analysis\u201d above. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bradford assay (Sigma). Caspase activity of cell extracts was measured using the Caspase-3/7-Glo assay (Promega) as recommended by the supplier. The assay provides a pro-luminescent caspase-3/7 substrate, which contains the amino acid sequence DEVD in a reagent optimised for caspase activity, luciferase activity and cell lysis. Presence of caspase 3 or 7 in the cell extract leads to cleavage of the substrate and light emission which is detected in a luminometer (Berthold). Three or more parallel samples were analysed to measure caspase activity. 50 \u00b5l of protein extract (from cells and tissues) were mixed with 25 \u00b5l of the Caspase Glo reagent and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. after which the readings were taken. Apoptosis in RAW cells was also confirmed by measuring cell viability using the Cell-Titre Blu reagent (Promega) and DNA laddering on a 2% agarose gel.",

The interaction between time and treatment was included in the model so each treatment would have its own growth rate. We also considered a spline at day 23 (weaning threshold). The spline allows the growth rate to change after the day 23 for each treatment. This way we are able to test differences of the growth rate between treatments before and after weaning. The model was fitted using generalized estimation equations (GEE) with compound symmetry for the working correlation matrix because of the repeated measurements for weight. The comparisons of the average growth rates between the three groups were computed using the covariance matrix of the model coefficients.

Milk from control animals displayed a series of protein bands, with the most prominent proteins corresponding to molecular weights previously observed for \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-casein (with apparent molecular weights of 42, 30 and 25 kDa, respectively) [28]. The identity of the protein bands was confirmed using mass-spectrometry. Table 4 details the data for the 8 most prominent protein bands indicated in Fig. 2c. These findings were also supported using Western blot analyses for \u03b1-casein and \u03b2-casein (Fig. 3a and 3b). Milk from \u03b1-casein deficient mice shows some characteristic protein bands which are absent from milk of wild-type or heterozygous mice (Fig. 2d). Mass-spectrometry analysis was used to identify some of these proteins. The major additional band with an apparent molecular weight of 78 kDa was identified as grp78/BiP. BiP is an ER resident protein which is involved in the assembly of multi-protein complexes like antibodies [29], [30]. The identity of the grp78/BiP protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3c). In addition two further ER-resident proteins, grp94 and PDIA6 (protein disulfide-isomerase associated protein 6), were detected in milk of the \u03b1-casein deficient mice (Fig. 2d, table 4).",

We therefore analysed whether the grp78/BiP, grp94 and PDIA6 proteins are up-regulated in lactating mammary tissue of \u03b1-casein null mice using protein gel analysis (Fig. 4a) and Western blotting (Fig. 4c). In total protein extracts derived from mammary tissue it is evident that grp78/BiP and grp94 expression is indeed up-regulated in response to the absence of \u03b1-casein. In contrast, the PDIA6 protein can not discerned in Coomassie stained gels of mammary protein extracts, as it co-localises with other proteins of similar molecular mass. Grp78, grp94 and PDIA6 are all ER resident proteins which are not normally secreted from the cells but act as chaperones, aiding protein folding. Their up-regulation is typically associated with ER stress [31], [32], [33]. This suggests that the lack of \u03b1-casein protein in mammary epithelial cells induces ER stress. Analysis of gene expression rates of grp78, grp94 and PDIA6 confirms that all three genes are significantly up-regulated in tissue samples of \u03b1-casein deficient mice with respect to control mice and heterozygous mice (Fig. 4d). In contrast, another protein often up-regulated under conditions of ER stress, REDD1 [34] is not significantly regulated by the absence of \u03b1-casein (Fig. 4d),",

Expression of the casein genes was correlated with expression of the reference genes GAPDH (shown in Fig. 5b and c) and \u03b2-actin (Fig. 5d). Identical results were obtained for both reference genes. As expected the amount of \u03b1-casein specific mRNA in heterozygous mice is at 50% of control levels and absent in homozygous knock-out mice. Expression of the corresponding \u03b2-casein and \u03b3-casein casein genes is significantly reduced in \u03b1-casein deficient mice (to around 10% of the expression levels detected in wild-type and heterozygous mice; Fig. 5b, c and d). This suggests that the absence of the \u03b1-casein protein not only interferes with protein secretion from the mammary epithelial cells but that absence of both alleles of the \u03b1-casein gene also reduces the expression of the other casein genes. The expression of the \u03ba-casein gene is also affected but not to the same extent. Its expression is reduced to around 20% of control levels in \u03b1-casein deficient mice (Fig. 5c and d). No consistent reduction of \u03b2-casein, \u03b3-casein and \u03ba-casein expression is detected in the heterozygous animals. Fig. 5d presents the expression of the casein genes as percentages of wild-type expression. The consistent reduction of \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03ba-casein gene expression in the \u03b1-casein deficient mammary tissue is highly significant (p<0.001; table 6) whereas expression changes in heterozygous vs wild-type mice are marginally or not significant (all p values>0.01; table 6).",

As expected \u03b1-casein expression was clearly detectable in tissue from wild-type control mice and heterozygous mice (Fig. 6a). In contrast no \u03b1-casein protein could be detected in sections of a-casein deficient mice (Fig. 6a). As expected sections analysed with pre-immune serum did not show any \u03b1-casein specific staining (Fig. 6a). No gross morphological alterations were detected in the sections of the different genotypes (Fig. 6b). This suggests that the absence of \u03b1-casein, although critical for overall milk composition, does not significantly impact on the survival of the mammary gland. To address this question further we measured the expression and activity of capase proteins in the mammary gland. Firstly we assessed the presence of cleaved caspase 3 in the protein extracts derived from control mice, heterozygous mice and \u03b1-casein deficient mice. No cleaved caspase 3 could be detected (Fig. 7a). In contrast cleaved caspase 3 protein with the expected molecular weight of 19 kDa was readily detected in the extracts of RAW264 cells treated with 10 \u00b5M staurosporin (Fig. 7a). Similarly, no specific signals for cleaved caspase 3 could be detected in immuno-histochemical analyses of tissue sections. In addition, caspase 3 and caspase 7 activities was measured in cytoplasmic protein extracts derived from mammary tissue of control, heterozygous and \u03b1-casein deficient mice. No significant differences in caspase 3 and 7 were detected (Fig. 7b). In contrast a significant increase in caspase activity could be detected in RAW cells treated with 10 \u00b5M staurosporin (Fig. 7b).",

This effect was seen when \u03b1-casein deficient dams nursed their own pups and if the offspring of wild-type mice was nursed by deficient dams. This demonstrates that the effect is mediated by the genotype of the nursing female. This effect was also seen in two further litters after breeding of the \u03b1-casein deficient mice onto a CD1 background (Kolb et al., unpublished). All females were able to nurse their pups, as indicated by the presence of milk in the stomach (\u2018milk spot\u2019) in all groups of pups (Table 3). However, by day 6, pups nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient dams were visibly emaciated (Fig. 8a) in comparison with pups nursed by control dams (Fig. 8b). By mid-lactation offspring nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient mice are significantly smaller than offspring nursed by control dams (Fig. 8c). Pre-weaning mortality was low in all groups and unaffected by dam genotype. Weighing of individual pups throughout lactation demonstrates that offspring nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient dams only reach a weight of around 3 g by the end of lactation, whereas pups nursed by control dams weigh around 12 g (Fig. 8d and Fig. 9a). After weaning mice were maintained on a standard chow diet ad libitum. Offspring nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient dams display a significantly accelerated growth with respect to the control group between weaning and day 50 of life (Fig. 9b and 10). However, this brief growth spurt is insufficient to bring the weight of pups nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient dams up to the weight of control animals in the long term (Fig. 9c). The difference in weight is displayed in both sexes (Fig. 9d).",

Pre-weaning observations indicated physical impairment in the \u2018small\u2019 mice. Measures of maturation (e.g. eye opening; tables 3 and 7) occur with a slight delay with respect to control animals. 60% and 50% of the pups nursed by wild-type dams had both eyes opened on day 14, all of the pups nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient females still had their eyes closed at that age, opening them only around 3 days later (Table 7). Physical abilities which rely on physical strength and coordination when tested on day 21 are significantly less developed in pups reared by \u03b1-casein deficient dams (Table 8). Significantly fewer of the growth impaired animals (36%, P-value<0.001 Fisher's exact test) were able to hold on to the pole in the vertical pole test, whereas none of the pups nursed by wild-type dams fell off before the pole reached a vertical position. Some animals nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient dams presented a rough condition of the fur (84%, P-value<0.001 Fisher's exact test) whereas all control animals had normal fur condition. Grip strength in growth impaired pups was significantly lower (P = 0.001), as 36% of the animals could not hold on to the cage lid for 15 seconds when it was turned upside down, compared to 3% and 0% in the two control groups. Animals nursed by knockout females defecated less during handling and scoring on day 21 (P-value<0.001, Mann Whitney U). Also significantly fewer (76%, P = 0.004) pups nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient females showed a provoked biting response at day 21 when compared to pups nursed by wild-type dams (100%). In summary, at pre-weaning the \u03b1-casein deficient milk suckled pups were smaller and physically weaker than those reared on wild-type milk.",

            "text": "Deficiency for \u03b1-casein severely impairs milk protein secretion in mice. In contrast \u03b2-casein deficiency does not result in a similar decline [5]. This suggests that, in contrast to \u03b2-casein, \u03b1-casein plays a more critical role in the establishment of a functional casein micelle thereby affecting secretion of all casein proteins. Alternatively or additionally due to the higher number of phosphate centres present in \u03b1-casein vs. \u03b2-casein (3 vs. 1), deficiency for \u03b1-casein (but not for \u03b2-casein) may decrease the stability of the biofluid resulting in a precipitation of calcium-phosphate in the Golgi vesicles. These results argue against a functional redundancy of the calcium-sensitive caseins (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-casein). Whereas overall secretion of milk proteins is not adversely affected in heterozygous mice (apart from a 50% reduction in \u03b1-casein protein secretion), milk protein secretion from mammary epithelial cells is severely curtailed in homozygous \u03b1-casein deficient mice. This affects both, caseins and whey proteins like WAP. In contrast, secretion of albumin which is not secreted by the mammary epithelial cells is not affected by the absence of \u03b1-casein. These results suggest a functional role for \u03b1-casein in casein micelle formation and/or stabilisation (similar to that of \u03ba-casein) [6]. We find that the glucose regulated protein 78 (grp78 or BiP) is significantly up-regulated in response to the absence of \u03b1-casein. Grp78/BiP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein whose expression is enhanced under conditions of ER stress [29]\n[31], [33]. Surprisingly the protein is also found in milk of \u03b1-casein deficient dams. This suggests that grp78/BiP may be critically involved in the assembly of the casein micelle. One can speculate that grp78/BiP is associated with the maturing casein micelle and is co-secreted with the immature micelle into milk. Two further ER resident proteins, grp94 and PDIA6 are also secreted into milk of \u03b1-casein deficient animals indicating that the lack of \u03b1-casein has significant impacts on protein processing and transport in the mammary epithelium. Interestingly, secretion of grp78/BiP and grp94 is also observed in mice over-expressing human protein C [37], [38]. This may suggest that perturbation of the balance of milk proteins invokes a common ER stress response resulting in the co-secretion of ER resident proteins into milk. Despite the clear evidence for changes to the expression and localisation of ER resident proteins there is no clear evidence for significant increases in mammary apoptosis in the absence of \u03b1-casein. Firstly, lactation is not terminated prematurely in the deficient animals suggesting that at least a significant portion of the mammary epithelial cells is viable. Under physiological conditions mammary gland involution after weaning leads to a complete cessation of milk secretion, apoptosis and regression of the epithelial tissue [39], [40]. In homozygous protein C transgenic mice no successful lactation is established, suggesting that in that case ER stress is followed by loss of mammary epithelium function [38]. Secondly, we cannot detect any gross morphological alteration of the secretory mammary epithelium in \u03b1-casein deficient mice. Thirdly, we also failed to detect increases in caspase activity in \u03b1-casein deficient mammary tissue. Finally, the apoptosis related genes which showed consistent and significant increases in mRNA expression in mammary tissue of \u03b1-casein deficient mice include the anti-apoptotic genes survivin (Birc5) and ARC/Nol3, suggesting that the mammary cells are actively avoiding apoptosis. On the other hand a reduction in the expression of the Traf1 gene, encoding an anti-apoptotic gene in the context of the mammary gland [41] suggests a balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic responses to \u03b1-casein deficiency. Taken together these findings may suggest that the ER-stress response in mammary epithelial cells of \u03b1-casein deficient mice is sufficient to rescue protein secretion, thereby preventing large scale apoptosis and loss of tissue function.",

Fig. 5d). In contrast no such reduction is observed in heterozygous mice. There could be (at least) two explanations for this. The deletion of cis-acting DNA elements in the \u03b1-casein gene may affect the expression of the entire casein gene locus. This genetic explanation would imply that the presence of one functional \u03b1-casein allele is sufficient to mediate the activation of both copies of the casein gene locus. Alternatively there may be physiological explanations. ER stress has been associated with an attenuation of protein synthesis [33]. One can speculate that in the mammary gland this leads to a decrease in the transcription of milk protein genes which account for most of the transcripts during lactation to prevent overloading of a compromised endoplasmic reticulum [33]. A decrease in the abundance of milk protein gene specific mRNAs was also observed in the transgenic mice over expressing human protein C [38]. Alternatively, the viability of the secretory mammary epithelial cells may be impaired to some degree by the ER stress response, leading to a lower relative number of casein producing cells in the mammary gland.",

The effect of \u03b1-casein deficiency in mice is similar to that reported for a \u03b1S1-casein deficient goat breed (Cn0) in that total casein secretion is reduced by around 75% [18]. While there are no data available which suggest a critical growth delay in the offspring of \u03b1S1-Cn0 goats, it is unlikely that an allele that would have a nutritional impact similar to the inactivation of the \u03b1-casein in mice could have persisted in the natural environment. In addition, the absence of \u03b1-casein does not appear to have a critical effect on calcium secretion in goats [17]. This indicates that there may be species (and maybe also strain-) specific differences in the assembly of casein micelles.",

Pups nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient dams only reach 25% of body weight of control animals at weaning and even at later stages in life remain around 33% lighter than control animals. The experiments described in this paper have been carried out with 3 litters of each genotype on a C57BL/6 background. However we have observed the same phenotype of reduced weight gain during lactation with two more litters on a CD1 background (Kolb et al., unpublished data), suggesting that the phenotype is similar in different genetic backgrounds. The observed changes in calcium concentration in the milk of \u03b1-casein deficient animals are unlikely to play a role in this permanent reduction in body size as calcium restriction during lactation only exerts a transient growth delay in rodents [42].",

Variations in litter size lead to differences in adult body weight, although generally the effects in mice are less drastic (around 10% in adulthood) than those observed in offspring nursed by \u03b1-casein deficient dams. Alternatively, milk protein concentration can be manipulated by changing the protein content of diet of the nursing dams [45]. Specific alterations in milk composition have been more difficult to achieve technically and have relied on rearing rodent pups by gastrostomal nutrition away from their mothers [52]. However, this results in a radically different early environment as these pups are not exposed to the normal maternal behaviour [53].

But the growth hormone/IGF axis and programming of appetite control have been implicated as key mediators. Attenuated growth rates in early post-natal life provide a significant protection against metabolic disease and extend health- and lifespan [45], [51], [54], [55], [56]. Many genetic mutations of the growth hormone/IGF axis result in both, small body size and an increased life- and health-span. Increased life-span and increased resistance to metabolic disease is also observed in mice nursed by dams on a low protein diet [45]. This suggests that permanent changes in body size induced by altered protein supply during lactation are accompanied by an improvement in metabolic health. In humans formula feeding has been associated with both, a more rapid increase in body weight during lactation [57] and an increased susceptibility to metabolic disorders [46], [58], [59].",
