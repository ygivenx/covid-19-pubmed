A variety of laboratory techniques have been used to survey the epidemiology of animal infectious diseases, among which animal pathogen surveillance and tracking the molecular epidemiology of pathogens are important strategies [1, 2]. These methods usually involve pathogen isolation and identification, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, and sequencing analyses. These methods often target a single known pathogen; however, the analysis of multiple pathogens in one or more hosts requires multiple detection methods, personnel, or even laboratories. Furthermore, these approaches cannot monitor and provide an early warning for pathogens of other animal diseases and viruses that have not yet been sequenced.",

Metagenomics has been used to detect and monitor human pathogens [3], animal pathogens [4], and plant pathogens [5]. Metagenomics-based detection methods are highly sensitivity, and they do not target any specific pathogens. Instead, they comprehensively scan the entire genome of the samples and, therefore, pathogens can be detected no matter whether they are included in the monitoring plan. Moreover, these methods can even discover the viruses which have not been sequenced, and they can directly analyze the genotypes, virulence, and molecular evolution of pathogens. The use of NGS has been confirmed for detecting microorganisms in human clinical samples [6\u20138] and infectious viruses in numerous animal species. The method of preparing the sequencing libraries and the NGS platform used in this study have been evaluated previously [9, 10], and viruses in clinical samples from single animal hosts have also been detected using the same standard NGS procedure in our laboratory [10\u201312].",

Briefly, the extracted viral RNA was quantified by Qubit assays (Life Technologies, USA) to ensure samples were greater than 100ng/\u03bcL and then digested using RNase III. The fragmented RNA was ligated with random adaptors and barcodes, and this was followed by reverse transcription. The cDNA was amplified by PCR with 8 cycles, and amplicons of approximately 350 bp were collected with the E-Gel SizeSelect Agarose Gel (Life Technologies, USA). The six libraries were diluted to 26 pM and mixed with equal volumes. The Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) Template OT2 200 Kit (Life Technologies, USA) was used to pretreat the DNA libraries prior to sequencing. The treated samples were loaded onto an Ion 316 chip and sequenced using the Ion Torrent PGM platform (Life Technologies) with the Ion PGM Sequencing 200 Kit (Life Technologies, USA) [13]. Quality control was autorun by the Ion Torrent PGM platform to delete some low quality reads. The reads of the sequenced samples were compared to sequences in the non-redundant protein databases using the nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTx) [14]. An E-value of 10\u22125 was used as the cutoff value for significant hits. The BLASTx results were parsed using the MetaGenome Analyzer (MEGAN version 5.10.5) with the default LCA parameters [15], and the taxonomic assignment was based on the first hit to identify the major viral infections in each farm.",

Rapid Typing and Analysis Software of Influenza A Virus was established by Perl on Lunix systems to complete a series of analysis, typing and genetic evolution research of Influenza A Virus in short time, based on the sequence comparison results to the Influenza A Virus reference sequence including each gene in every subtype. The software has got the Computer Software Copyright Registration Certificate (No. 2804125) received from National Copyright Administration of the PRC. The phylogenetic relationship of the detected H9N2 AIVs were analyzed by amplifying the hemagglutinin (HA) genes (about 1700 bp) by RT-PCR using the reported specific primers [22] (Table 2). PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.), cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China), and then sequenced using synthetic oligonucleotides (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Nucleotide sequences of the RT-PCR products for HA genes obtained from the five H9N2 AIVs were aligned using MUSCLE software [26] and compared to the sequences of the other 28 reference H9 subtype isolates including all the H9 subtypes AIV lineages, using the software package MEGA 6.0 [27, 28]. The 28 reference isolates (S1 Table) included strains from four lineages (Clades h9.1-h9.4) of H9 subtype AIVs. The phylogenetic tree was calculated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with the GTR+G substitution model and 1000 bootstraps. Their proteolytic cleavage sites (amino acids [1] 335\u2013341 in H9N2 subtype and aa 342\u2013348 in H3N8 subtype) [29, 30] in the translated HA amino acid sequence were analyzed to understand the pathogenicity of the AIVs [31].",

The assembled HN fragment (about 450 bp) of the identified virus was then compared with those of 13 NDV strains (S3 Table) representative of all the different genotypes [33, 34] using MEGA 6.0 [28] to construct a phylogenetic tree and analyze the NDV genotypes. The phylogenetic tree was calculated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with the GTR+I substitution model and 1000 bootstraps. Cleavage of the NDV F protein is known to be required for initiation of infection and is considered to be a major determinant of NDV virulence [35]. A fragment including the altered fusion protein (F) cleavage site was amplified using the reported primers F1 and F2 [23] (Table 2). PCR products were purified and cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China), and then sequenced using synthetic oligonucleotides (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China). Their proteolytic cleavage sites (aa 112 to 118) in the translated amino acid sequence were analyzed to understand the pathogenicity of NDV[35, 36].",

We also analyzed the subtype of AIV, genotypes of NDV and IBV, and pathogenicities of AIV and NDV in this study. All the detected AIVs and NDV were low pathogenic or avirulent viruses. These kinds of viruses can be usually found in Chinese poultry farms [41, 42]. The three avian IBVs detected in the three farms were identified as genotypes 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I, and TC07-2, by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes compared with 33 reference viruses. The TC07-2-type was first detected in Guangdong province in 2007 [43], and classified as CH VI lineage by S1 gene phylogenetic analysis [44]. In this study, the lineage was named as TC07-2-type, consistent with the principles of genotype nomenclature for molecular analysis of IBVs [45]. Because the assembled contigs from the NGS reads was too short (about 250 bp) or located in the genes which was not suitable for phylogenetic analysis, the phylogenetic analysis of AIV and IBV was based on the sequence of PCR fragments. Few reads matched to rotavirus G, DHBV, and ALV-J, and these matched reads were not located on genes available for phylogenetic analysis, and it was therefore not possible to construct phylogenetic trees for these three detected viruses. Because of the low abundance of viruses in the clinical samples, the quantity and quality of the viral sequence in the NGS should be enhanced to analyze the genotype and phylogenetic relationship from the NGS data directly. Because animals are fed in flocks, animal disease surveillance focuses on the infecting pathogens of each flock. Therefore, the metagenomics-based pathogen surveillance method established in this study also focused on poultry groups. The poultry in the same field were considered as a single sampling pool. The high sensitivity of the NGS technology ensures that major kinds of viral pathogens in mixed samples can be detected. In this study, the results were validated by traditional PCR or RT-PCR techniques, which were consistent with the metagenomics-based pathogen surveillance method to certify whether the viruses were percent or absent in the clinical samples. However, this method had some limitations. The absence of pathogens on farms where none were detected by NGS was not confirmed by comparing the current metagenomics results with an independent set of test results. Furthermore, no sequences other than the virus sequences were analyzed.",
