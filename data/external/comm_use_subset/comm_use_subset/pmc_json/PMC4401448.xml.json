Astroviruses are classified into two genera; the Mamastrovirus genera includes astroviruses isolated from humans, pigs, cattle, cats and dogs, whereas astrovirus isolates from birds are categorised into the Avastrovirus genera (King et al., 2011). Astroviruses were first identified in 1975 in the stools of children with diarrhoea (Appleton and Higgins, 1975; Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975), and are now estimated to cause up to 10% of gastroenteritis cases in children worldwide (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005).",

An internal extraction control (equine arteritis virus RNA) was added during the nucleic acid extraction process as previously described (Caddy et al., 2013).cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using MMLV reverse transcriptase enzyme (Life Technologies) and random hexamers (Life Technologies) with the reaction performed at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by an inactivation step at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min. qPCR was performed using primers targeting a conserved region of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as previously described (Martella et al., 2011). The sequences of primers used for PCR in this study are presented in Table 1. qPCR reactions were prepared using the MESA Blue qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Assay (Eurogentech). Briefly, 2 \u03bcl cDNA was mixed with 2\u00d7 MasterMix and 0.5 \u03bcM primers, then incubated at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. The thermal cycle protocol used with a ViiA7 qPCR machine (AB Applied Biosystems) was as follows: 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C, 15 s; 56 \u00b0C, 30 s; 72 \u00b0C, 30 s, followed by generation of a melt curve. Viral genome copy number was calculated by interpolation from a standard curve generated using serial dilutions of a standard DNA amplicon cloned from a positive control. The limit of detection was determined by the lowest dilution of control standard CNA reproducibly detected in the assay. All samples were additionally screened for the presence of canine parvovirus (CPV), canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV) and canine norovirus (CNV) using a 1-step qRT-PCR protocol (Caddy et al., 2013).",

            "text": "A number of studies have reported the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of astrovirus capsids to be relatively conserved, whereas the central region is hypervariable. The human astrovirus capsid protein has previously been divided into three regions; the N terminus (amino acids 1\u2013415), a variable central region (416\u2013707), which includes a hypervariable section from 649 to 707, and a conserved C terminus (708\u2013786) (Willcocks et al., 1995). An analogous approach for the CaAstV capsid was taken by Zhu et al. (2011), who divided the capsid into three regions for analysis: amino acids 1\u2013446, 447\u2013730, and 731\u2013end. The four capsid sequences derived from this study have been analysed according to the latter scheme, and sequence identity compared (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of the three regions clearly shows that the majority of sequence variation is concentrated in region II. A 24 nt deletion was identified in samples 2\u20134 in the 5\u2032 end region II, which has previously been reported in Chinese CaAstV strains (Zhu et al., 2011). It is not possible to predict the location of this deletion on the capsid structure as it is beyond the region of the astrovirus capsid spike for which the crystal structure has been solved (Dong et al., 2011). However, sequence alignment with the human astrovirus type 8 capsid (GenBank AAF85964.1) shows this deletion to be located downstream of the caspase cleavage site required for virion maturation, which truncates the full length capsid protein (VP90) into the mature VP70 form (Banos-Lara and M\u00e9ndez, 2010). Therefore it is predicted that the 24 nt deletion will not alter the mature virion.",

In other astroviruses, it has been proposed that the C-terminal VPg cleavage site is coded by Q(P/A/S/L) (Al-Mutairy et al., 2005), and the presence of a QS dipeptide at the same site in CaAstV is consistent with this prediction. The amino acid motif KGK(N/T)K is conserved at the N-terminal end of VPg sequences from both astroviruses and caliciviruses, and this is also identifiable in the CaAstV genome. Another conserved VPg motif is TEXEY, with mutagenesis studies indicating that the Y (tyrosine) residue covalently links VPg to viral RNA (Fuentes et al., 2012). Analysis of the CaAstV ORF1a sequence also identifies the conserved TEXEY motif at 684\u2013688, thus this tyrosine is predicted to covalently link to the RNA genome. However, the CaAstV sequence diverges slightly from the other mamastroviruses studied, in that X of the motif corresponds to K, whereas this is E/Q in all other mamastroviruses.",

It may be predicted that this is an underestimation of prevalence based on the population of dogs surveyed. The majority of previous CaAstV epidemiological studies have focused on dogs less than 6 months old, whereas this study included dogs of any age. Serological studies have shown that exposure to CaAstV typically occurs in young animals, with dogs older than 3 months significantly more likely to be seropositive than younger dogs (Martella et al., 2011). This suggests that studies focusing only on young dogs will identify more positive CaAStV cases. However, the decision to survey dogs of any age in this study enabled detection of a CaAstV case in a 7-year-old dog. This is oldest case of CaAstV reported to date and highlights the need to have an index of suspicion for infectious causes of gastroenteritis in dogs of any age.

Phylogenetic analysis of the UK capsid strains alongside the limited number of CaAstV sequences previously listed in GenBank was unexpected. There was no clustering of the UK strains, unlike the grouping of all Chinese strains. Instead UK strains each grouped with a different CaAstV isolate from either China or Italy. With such limited sequences available it is not possible to determine whether CaAstV strains have spread globally, or independent evolution has occurred. Clearly a high rate of evolution does occur within all astroviruses however, as their RNA genome facilitates introduction of point mutations and recombination events.",

This has previously been reported for astroviruses of mink, which show variation in their ability to invade the central nervous system in a strain related manner (Martella et al., 2012). Assessment of this risk will require wider epidemiological and clinical studies. Another concern raised by the existence of multiple circulating CaAstV strains is regarding future disease control. Management of viral causes of gastroenteritis in dogs is best achieved by widespread vaccination, exemplified by the widely used canine parvovirus vaccine. However, if CaAstV vaccine development is considered, the presence of multiple strains will make vaccine design challenging.",
