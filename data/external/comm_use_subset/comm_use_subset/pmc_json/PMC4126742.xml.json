            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, family Rhabdoviridae) is a prototypic nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus (order Mononegavirales) serving as a model for other human and animal pathogens including other rhabdoviruses such as rabies virus. VSV is also being widely investigated as a vector for vaccines (reviewed in [1]), gene therapy (reviewed in [2]) and oncolytic (anticancer) virotherapy (reviewed in [3], [4]). As a result, currently two phase I human clinical trials evaluating the safety of the VSV-based HIV vaccines (Clinicaltrials.gov, trials NCT01438606 and NCT01578889) are currently in progress. In addition, a phase I human clinical trial using replication-competent oncolytic VSV against hepatocellular carcinoma is in progress (trial NCT01628640). VSV replicates in the cytoplasm and contains a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA genome of approximately 11 kb encoding five viral proteins, all of which are included in the mature virion. The large polymerase protein (L) and phosphoprotein (P) together form the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In mature virions, the RdRp is associated with the nucleocaspid (N) protein encapsidated viral genome, together forming the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The matrix (M) protein is responsible for nucleocapsid condensation and is the primary driving force behind viral budding through the host cell plasma membrane, whereby the virion obtains its lipid bilayer envelope. Embedded in that envelope is the transmembrane glycoprotein (G), which is essential for receptor binding and cell entry (reviewed in [5]).",

            "text": "VSV virions, like those of many viruses, contain not only virus encoded-proteins, but also host (cellular) proteins [45]. Some of these proteins are enclosed within the virion structure, while others, in the case of enveloped viruses like VSV, are embedded in the host-derived membrane [6]. While many of these incorporations could be \u201caccidental\u201d, others may reflect the mechanism of virus assembly, be necessary for viral function, impact host range and infection efficiency, or influence the outcome of subsequent infections. For example, a recent study showed that depletion of a number of host proteins normally incorporated into herpes simplex virus type-1 virions not only reduced virion production in those cells, but that new infections with the resulting virions also yielded fewer progeny virions even in cells expressing normal levels of the host protein [7]. The host-derived proteins of a virus may also affect the host immune response. This is an especially important consideration for viruses, including VSV, used in therapeutic applications where large numbers of virus particles are administered, as it may influence efficacy as well as the potential for adverse side effects. Incorporation of ICAM-I into the envelope of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) not only increased infection efficiency [8], [9], [10], [11] but also interfered with virus neutralization by host antibodies [12], [13], [14], [15]. In another example, the presence of host complement control proteins such as CD46, CD55 and CD59 in the viral envelope has been shown to protect against antibody dependent complement mediated virus lysis in several viruses including human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I [16], human cytomegalovirus [16], hepatitis C virus [17], HIV-1 [18], [19], extracellular enveloped vaccinia virus [20], simian virus 5 [21] and mumps virus [21].",

These quantities were chosen so that the total amount of viral N plus P protein was approximately equivalent for both sample types. Each gel lane was cut into 13 or 14 gel bands for analysis. Gel pieces were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel matrix, separated using Waters ACQUITY ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with nano-split and analyzed using a LTQ-XL tandem mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as described previously [50]. Briefly, samples were separated by a 65 min linear gradient from 95% Solvent I (0.1% formic acid in water)/Solvent II (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) to 50% Solvent I/II at a flow rate of 500 nl/min on reversed phase chromatography using a trap/elute method with a in-house C18 sample trap in line with a C18 analytical column. Each full MS scan was followed by eight MS/MS scans of the most intense ions with data-dependent mode using the dynamic exclusion option (Top 8 method). The spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm of the Bioworks software (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA; version 3.3.1 SP1) against the IPI.HUMAN.v.3.18 and IPI.MOUSE.v.3.18 databases concatenated with a VSV and Sendai virus protein database. A parent ion mass tolerance of 2.0 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.0 Da, and a 16 Da differential modification for methionine oxidation were used for search parameters. Protein identifications were accepted when the peptide probability was greater than 95.0% [51], the protein probability was greater than 99.0%, and contained at least two unique peptides. Scaffold software was used for data compiling of each group and calculating spectral counts, unique peptides, percent coverage and emPAI [52], [53], [54]. While a single set of gel bands was isolated for each sample, three replicate UPLC-MS/MS runs were conducted for the whole and ProK virion samples, although one set of runs could not be used for the whole virions due to poor data quality.",

These bands were then subjected to in-gel trypsin digest and the resulting peptides were extracted, separated by UPLC and analyzed by tandem MS (MS/MS). In this study, virions were grown on BHK-21 cells as it is the standard cell line for growth of VSV and the high virion yields aid in purification. However, a complete database of Syrian hamster proteins is not available. Instead, peptides were identified by matching them to either a human or a mouse database. The results from both searches were highly similar; therefore only those from the search of the mouse database are presented here.",

This is a considerably larger number of host protein than identified in our previous study where 30 proteins were identified in a different preparation of BHK-21 derived virions [45]. This is likely primarily due to dividing the samples into a larger number of bands following 1-D SDS-PAGE. In addition, in the present study we used enhanced sample separation through use of UPLC, which should also allow for more sensitive detection. Of the 30 proteins detected in BHK-21 derived whole virions in our previous study, 27 were detected in at least one sample type here, showing consistency in the proteins detected in independent virion preparations purified using two different methodologies (continuous iodixanol gradient versus discontinuous sucrose gradient). Differences in the purity of the virions prepared using these two methods could also contribute to differences in the number of host proteins identified. However, EM images, staining of total protein on SDS-PAGES gels and infectivity (4.2\u00d7107 PFU/\u00b5g total protein for the present method versus 2.4\u00d7107 PFU/\u00b5g total protein for our previously published method [45]) all indicate virions prepared using the method presented here are of equal or greater purity to those used previously.",

One possibility is that some of these proteins may have been masked by more abundant host or viral proteins that were removed by treatment. For example, 25% (19/76) of the proteins detected in ProK treated virions but not whole virions were from the position correlating to that of the viral G protein in the whole virion sample (Table S1 and Fig. 3a). Another possible explanation is that these proteins are in low abundance or possess other properties making them difficult to detect consistently by MS. Of the proteins found only in ProK treated virions, 50% of proteins were identified based on detection of only two unique spectra (the minimum number allowed under our criteria), as opposed to 15% for proteins also identified in whole virions (Table S1). Unsurprisingly, ease of detection also seemed to be a major determinate of consistency of detection between technical replicates. Proteins found in all technical replicates were identified based on only two unique spectra in 19% and 17% of cases for whole virions and ProK treated virions respectively, while proteins found in only one technical replicate were identified based on only two spectra in 71% and 77% of cases (Fig. 3c\u2013d and Table S1).",

Exceptions to this general pattern were keratins, common environmental contaminants, which were found across a wide range of molecular weight and therefore excluded from this analysis. Following ProK treatment, 74 of the 181 proteins identified in whole virions were no longer detectable, likely due to their removal by the treatment. However, other proteins were still detected in the ProK treated sample but appeared at a lower molecular mass versus the predicted molecular mass and/or that observed for whole virions, likely due to the removal of the extracellular domain. For example, hepatocyte growth factor receptor was found in a slice spanning approximately 140\u2013225 kDa in the whole virion while it was found in slices spanning approximately 50\u201380 kDa in ProK treated virions. This demonstrates the value of information about the approximate size of the proteins in the sample (as determined by the position of the gel band) in interpreting data from proteinase treated samples.",

The number of spectra went up upon ProK treatment for all VSV proteins except G where there was a sharp reduction. This is consistent with our other data (Fig. 3a) demonstrating that ProK treatment is effectively removing the extracellular domain of the VSV G protein. Removal of the extracellular domain was confirmed by determining the distribution of the spectra and peptides derived from the G protein (Fig. 4b). The mean number of spectra associated with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the G protein were unchanged between whole and ProK treated virions, while ProK treatment decreased the number of spectra associated with the extracellular domain of G. In looking at the distribution of the detected peptides in the G protein, ProK treatment completely eliminated peptides associated with the N-terminal portion of the extracellular domain while a few were still detected in the more C-terminal portion of the domain, suggesting this region has a slight degree of resistance to proteinase cleavage, although the decrease in spectral counts suggests the majority the G proteins were cleaved.",

Five of the chosen proteins were found in both whole and ProK treated virion samples and had similar spectral counts in both sample types (Table S1).

Based on this, proteins were determined to be associated with the viral RNP complex, associated primarily with the interior of the virion but not the RNP or associated primarily with the exterior of the virion. Most proteins were barely detectable in the RNP complexes, suggesting they do not associate with the viral RNP or that the association was disrupted under the conditions used for RNP isolation. Only for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy (ITCH) were substantial amounts of protein detected in RNP. The M protein of VSV, as well as other rhabdoviruses, contains a late domain (L-domain) including a proline rich PPxY motif known to bind WW domains found in a number of cellular proteins [62]. VSV M protein has been shown to bind the WW domain of Nedd4 (also detected in this analysis) [63], and can presumably also bind other HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases, including ITCH, as has been reported for other viruses with L-domains including PPxY motifs [64]. However, given that ITCH is present in RNP complexes at levels that nearly equal the other two sample types, while M protein is sharply reduced, it seems likely that ITCH may also interact with one of the RNP proteins (N, P or L). Three of the tested proteins, Yes1, casein kinase I isoform alpha (Csnk1a1) and heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hspa8; also known as Hsc70), while barely detectable in RNP, were found at similar levels in whole and ProK treated virions, indicated they are primarily associated with the interior of the virions. In contrast, levels of Ptp4a2 and putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase Pl10 (D1pas1; also known as Ddx3y), dropped sharply in the ProK and RNP samples indicating they are not primarily located in the interior of the virion. One protein, coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 1A (Cc2d1a), identified by MS could not be detected by WB, indicating either protein levels below the threshold of detection, a misidentification of the protein based on homology, or a false-positive identification. The latter seems the least likely as the protein was identified in both sample types, with at least 6 consecutive amino acids matched in manual inspection.",

Transport of the VSV nucleocapsid to the site of budding has been shown to be dependent on microtubules [65] and is an important step in VSV assembly. Furthermore, as seen for many enveloped viruses (reviewed in [66]), VSV budding appears to use the host proteins involved in multivesicular body (MVB) formation which are relocated from endosomal membranes to the plasma membrane in an M protein dependent manner (reviewed in [67]). However, the budding of VSV and related viruses may still have some unique features. While the specific members of the MVB pathway utilized by VSV for its budding are not clear, it is known that, unlike what has been observed for many other viruses, Tsg101 is not essential for the budding of VSV and rabies virus [68], while contradictory reports exist regarding the importance of Vps4a [68], [69]. In contrast, the host ubiquitin-proteasome system does appear to be essential [63], [69].",

            "text": "The lipid composition of the VSV envelope is consistent with that of its host cell, although levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin are elevated [48], indicating that unlike some other viruses such as influenza virus and HIV-1 [70], [71], [72], VSV does not bud through host membrane regions enriched in lipid rafts. Instead, VSV G and M proteins appear to initially localize to separate microdomains of the host plasma membrane but then either merge or cluster together with each other and host protein containing microdomains at the site of virus budding [73]. Therefore, VSV readily incorporates the membrane proteins of its host. In pseudotyping experiments using both mixed virus infections and expression of viral or host proteins from VSV recombinants, non-VSV proteins can make up a significant portion of the protein in the VSV envelope, with incorporation levels up to 31% of that seen for VSV G protein reported [74], [75]. Consistent with these observations, 46% (118/257) of proteins identified in our study are associated with the cellular component GO term \u201cplasma membrane\u201d, suggesting they were acquired along with the envelope. The tendency of VSV to indiscriminately acquire relatively large numbers of host membrane proteins has the potential to be exploited to help fine tune therapeutic vectors through the choice of cell line used to generate the viruses. For example, growing oncolytic VSVs in a cell line naturally expressing or engineered to express high levels of complement control protein may improve efficacy by slowing the rate of clearance by the host immune system following administration.",
