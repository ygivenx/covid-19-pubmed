For example, avian FARNESYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (FPS) and yeast SQUALENE SYNTHASE (SQS) have been expressed in Nicotiana tabacum to promote squalene accumulation (Wu et al., 2012). New metabolic pathways have also been engineered, for example by introducing the pathway for the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin into Arabidopsis (Tattersall et al., 2001). Several other studies have found that directing key enzymes to chloroplasts can substantially increase the content of metabolites such as \u03b2\u2010carotene\u2014used to produce \u2018golden rice\u2019 (Ye et al., 2000)\u2014and terpenes, including patchoulol (Wu et al., 2006) and squalene (Wu et al., 2012).",

            "text": "However, nuclear transformation is associated with several disadvantages. Positional effects can reduce or silence transgene expression, making it difficult to establish a stable population that consistently accumulates high levels of the desired product (Jin and Daniell, 2015; Verma and Daniell, 2007). Additionally, lack of transgene containment raises regulatory issues and makes commercialization more challenging (Chan and Daniell, 2015). Some of these problems can be overcome by expressing transgenes via the chloroplast genome. Chloroplast transformation, which occurs through homologous recombination, contains transgenes (Verma et al., 2008), and its high ploidy\u2014up to 10 000 copies per cell\u2014permits transgene products to reach exceptionally high levels (Ruhlman et al., 2010). For example, tobacco chloroplasts expressing a multigene operon encoding Bt toxin allowed the protein to accumulate up to ~50% of total leaf protein and to form cuboidal crystals within chloroplasts (De Cosa et al., 2001); chloroplast\u2010expressed \u03b2\u2010glucosidase accumulated to 160\u2010fold higher levels than in untransformed plants (Jin et al., 2011); and proinsulin could make up nearly 70% of total transplastomic leaf protein (Ruhlman et al., 2010).",

In later studies, the chloroplast genome was engineered to express all six genes of the cytoplasmic mevalonate pathway for terpenoid synthesis (Kumar et al., 2012) or thirteen artemisinin pathway biosynthesis genes (Saxena et al., 2014), although in the latter case, expression was inadequate to meet target levels. However, chloroplast genome transformation requires further optimization, and a comparison of metabolic engineering outcomes via engineering different cellular compartments has not been performed.",

            "text": "The chloroplast genome is highly reduced, with many genes lost or transferred to the nucleus (Jensen and Leister, 2014). Consequently, chloroplast function requires the import of thousands of nuclear\u2010encoded proteins, many of which work in concert with plastid\u2010encoded gene products and require proper stoichiometry (Jin and Daniell, 2015). Therefore, the expression of nuclear\u2010 and plastid\u2010encoded genes must be coordinately regulated, and this occurs via anterograde signalling from the nucleus to plastids and retrograde signalling from plastids to the nucleus. Whereas anterograde signalling is well understood, retrograde signalling is still enigmatic. Chloroplasts may regulate nuclear gene expression via proteins (Jin and Daniell, 2014; Singh et al., 2008), redox state (Nott et al., 2006) or metabolites (Chi et al., 2015; Estavillo et al., 2011; Woodson et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2012), but these signals act only under specific circumstances, and mechanisms by which they are conveyed remain elusive. However, high accumulation of proteins expressed via the chloroplast genome and compartmentalization within chloroplasts make chloroplast genetic engineering an excellent system to study retrograde signalling.",

The availability of modern tools to study the metabolome and transcriptome facilitates global evaluation of the effect of these introduced pathways on native genes through metabolite\u2010mediated anterograde or retrograde signalling. Here, we used chloroplast genetic engineering and an existing nuclear transgenic line to uncover potential unintended consequences of expressing metabolic genes from different compartments. We focused on squalene because of its importance in steroid biosynthesis, its industrial applications in cosmetics and nutraceuticals (Kim and Karadeniz, 2012) and its use as a vaccine adjuvant (O'Hagan et al., 2011), as well as the availability of nuclear transgenic lines expressing squalene biosynthetic enzymes for comparative investigations (Wu et al., 2012). We found profound but similar off\u2010target effects on both the metabolome and transcriptome regardless of the compartment from which transgenes were expressed. By focusing on global effects of intercompartmental signalling rather than attempting to identify yet another signalling molecule, we provide a framework for future studies on large\u2010scale effects of metabolite\u2010mediated intercompartmental signalling.",

Encoded amino acid sequences were identical to those reported previously (Wu et al., 2012), but corresponding DNA sequences were codon\u2010optimized for enhanced chloroplast expression (Daniell et al., 2009). In pLD\u2010SQS, Flag\u2010SQS was regulated by the tobacco psbA promoter, 5\u2032\u2010UTR and 3\u2032\u2010UTR, and isoleucine tRNA (trnI) and alanine tRNA (trnA) flanking sequences were included for integration into the chloroplast genome via homologous recombination (Verma and Daniell, 2007). In pLD\u2010FPS\u2010SQS, expression of His\u2010FPS was controlled by the plastid rRNA operon promoter (Prrn), the 5\u2032 translation control element of bacteriophage T7 gene 10 and the tobacco rbcL 3\u2032\u2010UTR (Dhingra et al., 2004).",

Leaves of N were bombarded with pLD\u2010SQS to generate transplastomic lines expressing SQS from the chloroplast genome; the resulting line is referred to as \u2018CN\u2019. After selection and regeneration on spectinomycin\u2010containing media, several independent CN lines were regenerated from ten bombardments. PCR analysis with the 3P/3M primer set (Verma et al., 2008) indicated that the Flag\u2010SQS cassette had been stably integrated into the chloroplast genome via homologous recombination (Figure S1). After two additional rounds of selection on spectinomycin\u2010containing media, CN lines were confirmed by Southern blot. As shown in Figure 1a,b, several independent CN lines showed a 6.63\u2010kb band but not the 4.43\u2010kb WT band, confirming that homoplasmic plants had been generated. We also bombarded N with pLD\u2010FPS\u2010SQS, but no shoots survived. When pLD\u2010FPS\u2010SQS was used to transform WT tobacco, several independent transplastomic lines, referred to as \u2018C\u2019, were obtained, as confirmed by PCR (Figure S1) and Southern blot (Figure 1b, left). Two bands with correct sizes of 8.42 and 3.48 kb (due to the presence of a HindIII site in the His\u2010FPS cassette), but not the 7.67\u2010kb WT band, were observed in HindIII\u2010digested DNA from C lines, confirming that homoplasmic C lines had been generated (Figure 1b, right). Because the engineered His tag was not detectable in western blots, we confirmed expression of His\u2010FPS via the chloroplast genome using northern blot for the rbcL 3\u2032\u2010UTR (Figure 1a). In addition to the endogenous rbcL signal in each line, the C line showed an additional band corresponding to the expressed His\u2010FPS transgene (Figure 1c). Notably, the His\u2010FPS transcript was as abundant as that of rbcL, which is the most abundant protein on earth (Dhingra et al., 2004).",

High\u2010throughput sequencing reads were mapped to the tobacco genome, and transcripts were identified and quantified as previously described (Sierro et al., 2014). Hierarchical clustering analysis of expression counts for predicted transcripts demonstrated that expression patterns of each replicate for the three different transgenic lines were similar (Figure 4a). PCA showed close clustering within lines (Figure 4b). Unlike the metabolomic analysis, which showed N clustering more closely with WT and transplastomic CN and C lines clustering together (Figure 3a), transcriptomic analysis showed that overall gene expression profiles of each line were fairly separate. However, transcriptomes of engineered lines were more similar to each other than to WT (Figure 4b).",

However, neither transplastomic line accumulated significantly more squalene than N (Figure 3b, Tables 1 and S1), suggesting a substrate or storage limit. Consistent with this, in the background of PH, which has fewer glandular trichomes than 1068 (Wu et al., 2012), we could generate plants expressing SQS only; transforming PH chloroplasts with pLD\u2010FPS\u2010SQS yielded shoots that did not survive, and similar problems were encountered using nuclear transformation constructs that targeted FPS and SQS to chloroplasts. Inadequate trichomes (sinks) in PH may have caused this, perhaps through feedback inhibition. Indeed, the 2\u2010C\u2010methyl\u2010d\u2010erythritol 4\u2010phosphate (MEP) pathway of terpene biosynthesis is under feedback inhibition by its own products, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) (Banerjee et al., 2013), and IPP is the substrate of FPS. One strategy to increase squalene could be to increase sink capacity by sequestering squalene in storage compartments such as lipid droplets (Wang et al., 2015) or additional trichomes (Lange, 2015). Trichome density could be increased via transgenic expression of \u03b2\u2010glucosidase (Jin et al., 2011), which improves artemisinin yields in transgenic Artemisia annua (Singh et al., 2015).",

Fructose 6\u2010phosphate and glucose 6\u2010phosphate are both photosynthetic outputs from the Calvin cycle and are synthesized from glyceraldehyde 3\u2010phosphate, a three\u2010carbon Calvin cycle output.

Decarboxylated aromatic amino acids accumulated to at least eightfold higher levels in CN and C than in WT without an increase in their corresponding precursors (Figure 3d, Table 1). This result demonstrates that transplastomic lines are not impaired in amino acid biosynthesis and suggests the diversion of carbon into squalene biosynthesis, leading to an imbalance between carbon and nitrogen that explains the accumulation of these amino acid derivatives.

However, not only the number of DE transcripts differed, but also their expression levels (Tables 2 and 3). The signal may therefore be a different metabolite or metabolites, perhaps one affected by the imbalance between SQS and FPS levels in CN (Figure 3c, Table S1), but investigation of this possibility is beyond the scope of this study. Interestingly, an upstream molecule in the MEP pathway, methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP), acts as a retrograde signalling molecule under high light and wounding; these stresses induce accumulation of MEcPP to ~two\u2010 to threefold higher levels than in controls (Xiao et al., 2012). Altered flux through the MEP pathway may change the abundance of MEcPP, thereby causing at least a subset of observed transcriptomic changes in engineered plants. The effect of FPS and SQS expression could extend downstream of MEcPP and parallel to farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and/or squalene, and these metabolites may also serve as retrograde signals. Both IPP and DMAPP are precursors for the synthesis of carotenoids such as \u03b2\u2010carotene (Nisar et al., 2015), and a volatile \u03b2\u2010carotene derivative, \u03b2\u2010cyclocitral, has been proposed as a stress\u2010induced retrograde signalling molecule (Ramel et al., 2012). Increased demand for IPP by FPS or for FPP by SQS may affect carotenoid metabolism, and, consequently, \u03b2\u2010cyclocitral levels, causing altered retrograde signalling. Although none of these metabolites were significantly changed between WT and engineered lines in our analysis, it does not exclude the possibility that the abundance of one or more of them was altered, leading to changes in phenotype and gene expression. If such a difference had occurred, small changes needed to induce signalling (e.g. for MEcPP) and differences in detection and analytical methods may have excluded these metabolites from analysis, especially if differences were statistically insignificant.",

FPS and SQS expression may cause clear transcriptomic, metabolomic and phenotypic changes because they are metabolism related. For example, transplastomic tobacco expressing twelve genes for the biosynthesis of artemisinic acid (AA) accumulated only approximately 0.1 mg/g fresh weight (FW) AA, but growth was still reduced (Saxena et al., 2014), and nuclear transgenic plants accumulating linalool and nerolidol accumulated 1.5 \u03bcg/g FW of these terpenes but still displayed delayed growth (Aharoni et al., 2003). These observations may reflect the partitioning of carbon away from biomass and into the desired metabolite (Melis, 2013). By contrast, transgenic/transplastomic expression of genes that are unrelated to metabolism has few to no phenotypic effects and, in the case of transplastomic plants, can often be rescued by adding exogenous nitrogen (Bally et al., 2009, 2011; De Cosa et al., 2001; Ruhlman et al., 2010; Viitanen et al., 2004).

The DNA was blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Nytran SPC; GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA). Hybridization with DIG\u2010labelled probe for the trnI\u2010trnA flanking region (Figure 1a) was conducted at 41 \u00b0C in a UVP HB\u20101000 hybridizer (UVP LLC, Upland, CA), and signals were detected with CSPD substrate and X\u2010ray film. Probe for northern blot analysis was synthesized using the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Kit with a PCR product containing the rbcL 3\u2032\u2010UTR. Northern blot was performed using total RNA (see below) run on a 0.9% denaturing agarose gel. The RNA was blotted onto a Nytran membrane and hybridized with the probe at 42 \u00b0C. Signals were detected as for the Southern blot. For phenotypic analysis of homoplasmic transplastomic lines, data are representative of at least two independent transformation events.",
