            "text": "Group A rotaviruses (GARs) are the most common etiological agent of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, as well as being a common cause of acute enteritis in young farm animals [1]. They are members of the Rotavirus genus, within the Reoviridae family, and their genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) encased in a triple-layered capsid. These segments encode six structural (VP1-VP4, VP6, and VP7) and five or six non-structural proteins. Amongst these, the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4, which independently elicit the production of neutralization antibodies, define the G and P serotypes, and form the basis of a binomial nomenclature [1]. In recent years, the serotype classification system has been almost completely replaced by a genotyping classification system based on sequence differences of the respective gene segments [2,3]. Prior to the present study, at least 25 G genotypes and 33 P genotypes were identified in humans and animals [4,5]. Among them, at least 11 G genotypes (G1-G6, G8-G12) and 13 P genotypes (P[1], P[5]-P[8], P[11], P[13], P[19], P[13]/[22], P[23], P[26], P[27], and P[32]) have been described in pigs [6-11].",

GARs with unusual G genotypes commonly found in pigs and cattle have been detected in sporadic and epidemic cases of diarrhea in human populations [13-18]. A full genome-based genotyping system proposed by Matthijnssens et al. revealed the existence of reassortant strains and the close relationship between human and animal strains [2,3]. In addition, a number of new G and P genotypes have recently been identified in animals [4,5,7,19,20]. In light of these findings, animal GARs have come to be regarded as a potential reservoir for genetic diversity in human GARs, and studying them is therefore critical for understanding the evolution and ecology of human GARs.",

Given the present lack of a commercially available vaccine for GAR-associated diarrhea in Japan, the only means of prevention has been hygiene management. However, although effectively managing GAR infections requires an ecological understanding of GARs, few attempts have been made to examine the molecular epidemiology of porcine GARs associated with diarrhea within a farm over an extended length of time. We therefore investigated the genotypic characteristics of GARs causing repeated outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm over the course of a year.",

We therefore characterized the TJ4-1 strain by analyzing the complete coding sequence of the VP7 gene, which turned out to be 981-bp long and included a predicted protein of 326 amino acids. We compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences with those from the reference strains of the 25 established G genotypes (Table 3) and found that the highest identity was to the G3 RRV strain (80.2% nucleotide identity and 87.5% amino acid identity), with lower nucleotide and amino acid identities to other strains ranging from 61.1% to 78.1%, and 57.2% to 85.5%, respectively.

Sequence and phylogenic analysis of the VP7 and VP4 genes from detected GARs identified a spectrum of G and P genotypes, including G3, G5, G9, P[7], P[13]/[22], and P[23]. In addition, we identified the TJ4-1 strain, which contained a new VP7 genotype G26, as confirmed and assigned by the RCWG. Although the detected G and P genotypes (excluding G26) were common in pig populations worldwide [8,32,36,37], the strains identified in this study displayed marked genetic variation when compared to others around the world as well as older Japanese strains, suggesting genetic variability in GAR strains circulating in the pig population of Japan.",

Not only was the total number of samples low, but also, roughly half of them could not be successfully analyzed for either the VP7 or VP4 genes. However, despite these limitations, we found at least five different G/P combinations and six electropherotypes during the four outbreaks, indicating considerable genetic diversity of GAR strains within a farm continuing over one year. Co-circulation of different GAR strains in the same herd has also been reported in several studies: Collins et al. identified at least 2 to 6 GAR strains among asymptomatic pigs in each farm at a same time [32], and Barreiros et al. detected at least three strains during a diarrhea outbreak on a single swine farm [38]. While such genetic diversity in the same herd may have resulted from the introduction of new GAR strains, our results support the additional possibility of genetic reassortment between GAR strains within the herd. Indeed, the G9P[23] and G9P[13]/[22] strains contained almost identical G9 sequences, and the G3P[7] and G26P[7] strains had nearly identical P[7] sequences.",

            "text": "A previous study has shown that herds with GAR-associated diarrhea tend to be managed in an all-in all-out system and to have large numbers of sows [39]. Because diarrhea occurs in pigs when the oral challenge level of GAR exceeds the protective level of passive immunity acquired through colostrum and milk, the onset age and diarrhea severity are influenced by management practices that affect these factors, such as housing type, sanitation, and crate design [40]. By maintaining strict sanitation management and housing sows and gilts in separate units (about 4 000 sows were kept in 8 gestation and 14 farrowing barns), the farm in the present study might reduce the uniformity of exposure levels and immunity to GARs. The variation in affected pigs across the outbreaks appears to reflect the variation in the level of lactogenic immunity passed from sows to piglets (Table 1). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that differing immunity levels among sows or gilts may be associated with the existence of the genetically diverse GAR strains and the repeated diarrhea outbreaks.",

            "text": "Based on accumulated evidence, it is clear that GARs can transfer between pigs and humans, making pigs a potential reservoir for the emergence of unusual or novel strains of human GARs [13-18]. In fact, the novel G26 strain we found was most similar to the human 57vp7w strain, which can also be considered to be a G26 strain. The 57vp7w strain was reported as a rare G3P[19] human strain identified in a clinical sample collected in Thailand between 2004 and 2006 [35]. Although the origin of G26 remains unclear, the VP4 sequence of 57vp7w [GenBank: DQ674935] is genetically closely related to those of porcine P[19] strains detected in Thailand [6]. Further, genetic analysis of several genome segments of the TJ4-1 strain other than VP4 and VP7 revealed that, except for the VP7 gene, this strain shares a similar genetic background with the porcine YM strain [Miyazaki A, in preparation]. Taken together, these findings suggest that 57vp7w may be a porcine-human reassortant or a porcine strain. Considering that the newly identified G26 has been detected in both pigs and humans, and the scarcity of animal GAR strains in the genetic database, further surveillance and epidemiological study on GARs in domestic animals will be needed to better understand the origin and circulation of human GARs.",
