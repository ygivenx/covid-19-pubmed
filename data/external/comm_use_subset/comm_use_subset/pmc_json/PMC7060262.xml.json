            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are common worldwide, and in many countries constitute a major cause of mortality and morbidity1. The underlying pathogenetic agents behind acute respiratory infections vary geographically2, but the clinical importance of early diagnosis is universal. Two major reasons for the importance of early diagnosis are firstly to minimize time from start of symptom until initiation of proper medical therapy to reduce risks of protracted infection, sepsis/mortality, and late sequelae3. A second reason is to avoid improper use of antibiotics in cases where this is not indicated, emphasized by an increased universal problem with antibiotic resistance4. Within a few years after the discovery of penicillin, resistance to penicillin was observed and today antibiotic resistance has become a substantial clinical problem5. Bacterial infections have thus again reoccurred as a major threat to our health. To preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics it is important to use antibiotics more selectively and avoid unnecessary use. Biomarkers, which in early stage of an infection can distinguish between bacterial and viral infection could lead to a more selective use of antibiotics3.",

The infection leads to an activation of the innate immune system which is an early defense mechanism. The major functions of the innate immunity include the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, activation of the complement cascade and activation of white blood cells to eliminate the microorganisms. This is a rapid process and the neutrophil is the first cell to reach the affected location14. Neutrophil activation markers will be released from the neutrophils upon activation. These activation markers are stored in granulae or cytoplasm and can be rapidly released from the neutrophils15. As there is no need for de novo synthesis, a neutrophil marker should be an earlier marker of neutrophil activation caused by bacterial infections in comparison with formation of new white blood cells or synthesis of proteins.",

Performance of calprotectin was compared to performance of heparin binding protein (HBP) which also is produced in neutrophils but stored in the azurophil granules within the cells and procalcitonin (PCT) which is widely used as a marker for bacterial infections. We found significantly higher plasma calprotectin values in patients with bacterial respiratory infections (pneumonia, tonsillitis, or mycoplasma) than in patients with viral respiratory infections or healthy controls. The AUC for calprotectin and PCT were higher than the AUC for HBP when used for diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis (Fig. 2, Table 3). Furthermore, the AUC for calprotectin was significantly higher than that for both PCT and HBP in discriminating mycoplasma infections from viral infections. These data support clinical use of calprotectin in diagnosis of respiratory infections and indicate greater performance of calprotectin compared to HBP and PCT in distinguishing bacterial and mycoplasma respiratory infections from viral infections. Our findings are supported by observations from other studies about the limited clinical utility of procalcitonin in diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia16.",

PCT should not be affected by the coagulation process and was thus analyzed in serum samples. The HBP assay is a microtiter-based ELISA which is associated with very long test turnaround times as the test format requires collection of a number of samples prior to testing. The available commercial procalcitonin assays are either microtiter based or developed for specific assay platforms and these platforms are not available in all laboratories. This means that the samples may have to be sent to another laboratory for testing which also increases the time until the test results are available. The calprotectin assay used was a particle enhanced turbidimetric assay (PETIA) with an assay time of 10 min. PETIA is a technology that can be applied on routine chemistry analyzers available at most hospital laboratories allowing short test turnaround times. In comparison with ELISA it is designed for measuring single samples, and thus, shortens the analysis times significantly. This is important as bacterial infections are acute condition that requires rapid test results. In conclusion, calprotectin and procalcitonin performed better than HPB in distinguishing between pneumonia and tonsillitis caused by bacteria and viral infections. Furthermore, calprotectin was superior to HBP and procalcitonin in distinguishing between respiratory infections caused by mycoplasma and viruses in primary care and infectious disease unit patients. Our results indicate that calprotectin is altogether more sensitive than HBP and procalcitonin in distinguishing bacterial and mycoplasma from viral cause of respiratory infections.",
