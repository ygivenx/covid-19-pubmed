Several previous studies have provided strong evidence that hypovirulent mycoviruses could be used as substitutes for fungicides [13,14]. A recent study demonstrated that protoplast fusion is the most efficient approach for transmitting mycoviruses among a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi and that this approach will facilitate the use of mycoviruses as a biocontrol agent [15].",

Proteomics approaches for different Fusarium species have enabled examinations of extracellular proteins, proteins involved in fumonisin biosynthesis, and proteome profiles upon antagonistic rhizobacteria inoculation and mycovirus infection [18-21]. Several gene expression analyses based on microarrays have also been conducted [21-25]. For example, genome-wide expression profiling of F. graminearum was carried out to examine responses to treatment with azole fungicide tebuconazole and during perithecium development [22,24]. Microarrays provide a valuable tool for detecting and identifying Fusarium species that produce specific metabolites such as trichothecene and moniliformin [23,25]. Moreover, the recently completed genome sequencing of three major Fusarium species provides an important resource for studying pathogenicity and functions of individual genes [26].",

To identify differentially expressed genes, we first performed hierarchical clustering, which identified gene sets of significantly differentially expressed genes at two different time points (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). Most of the identified genes showed at least two-fold differential expression. A total of 1775 genes, representing 13.3% of 13,382 genes, were differentially expressed at both time points (Figure 2C), with 1109 (5.4%) and 1050 genes (5%) identified as differentially expressed at 36 h and 120 h, respectively (Figure 2C).

Moreover, 120 genes and 195 genes were commonly found in the group of down-regulated and up-regulated genes, respectively (Figure 2D, E). We then investigated the expression patterns of 384 genes that were differentially expressed at both time points using hierarchical clustering, which sorted the genes into four groups according to expression patterns (Figure 2F). Group A contained 36 genes that were highly down-regulated at 36 h but were up-regulated at 120 h. In contrast, the 33 genes belonging to group B were highly induced at 36 h, and subsequently down-regulated (Figure 2F).

Genes that showed diverse expression patterns were categorized into different functional classes (Figure 3 and Additional file 3: Table S3). The results of the qRT-PCR were highly consistent with those of the microarray data. For example, according to the qRT-PCR and microarray results, the transcript levels for three genes, including FGSG_01379, FGSG_03143, and FGSG_03911, were highly reduced at both 36 h and 120 h, whereas FGSG_03788, FGSG_00023, FGSG_07804, FGSG_07801, and FGSG_13222 were strongly induced regardless of the time point (Figure 3A\u2013C). When the mRNA level of a gene is too low to quantify, or the P-values from the microarray data are very high, it is highly likely that qRT-PCR results will not correlate with microarray data, as was observed for FGSG_11119 and FGSG_04089 (Figure 3A). As compared to the microarray approach, qRT-PCR offers a highly sensitive technique for detecting low amounts of transcripts and provides the transcript level for the gene of interest. For example, the expression intensities for 11 genes were relatively low, ranging from 0 to 2.97 (Figure 3A), whereas the amount of mRNAs for NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases (FGSG_07801) and dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (FGSG_13222) were very high and ranged from 4424.26 to 5254.08, particularly in the host containing FgV1-DK21 at 36 h (Figure 3C).",

Specifically, we divided differentially expressed genes into four groups (Table 2). More than half of the differentially expressed genes were not assigned to any functional category. Specifically, 344 genes (71.9%) in the group of down-regulated genes at 120 h were unclassified. Of the functional categories, the vast majority of differentially expressed genes were associated with metabolism (Table 2). Note that 118 genes (28.2%) were down-regulated while 81 genes (22.9%) were up-regulated at 36 h, whereas there were more up-regulated genes (95) than down-regulated genes (79) at 120 h. Based on the number of differentially expressed genes, it is likely that genes involved in various metabolic pathways were severely repressed at 36 h and then were gradually induced at 120 h. Along with a gene set for metabolism, genes associated with energy were highly down-regulated (26 genes) at 36 h (Table 2). In contrast, genes involved in transcriptional and translational machinery were dominantly up-regulated early after FgV1-DK21 infection. For example, genes associated with the cell cycle and DNA processing (21 genes), transcription (46 genes), protein synthesis (35 genes), protein fate (18 genes), and those encoding proteins with binding function (81 genes) were highly up-regulated at 36 h. The number of down-regulated genes associated with cellular transport at 36 h was almost twice that of up-regulated genes. Conversely, the number of up-regulated genes that govern cellular transport was similar to that of the down-regulated genes at 120 h.",

Thus, it is of interest to understand their involvement in fungi\u2013virus interactions at the transcriptional level. Whole genome sequences of F. graminearum show that there are at least 659 TFs divided into 44 families [31]. We identified more differentially expressed TFs at the early time point (57 TFs) than at the late time point (27 TFs) ( Additional file 6: Table S6). Zn2Cys6 (42 TFs) was the most prevalent TF family, followed by the C2H2 zinc finger (7 TFs) and bHLH (2 TFs) families. In addition, centromere protein B, DNA-binding region, homeodomain-like, Lambda repressor-like, DNA-binding, nucleic acid-binding, OB-fold, TF jumonji, and bZIP were also identified as TFs showing significant change at the transcript level ( Additional file 6: Table S6). Zn2Cys6 (15 TFs) was also the most prominent TF family at the late time point, followed by C2H2 zinc finger (3 TFs), bHLH (2 TFs), and bZIP (2 TFs) ( Additional file 6: Table S6). Moreover, the gene expressions of TFs belonging to the Myb (a negative transcriptional regulator), TF jumonji, zinc finger (CCHC-type), and zinc finger (NF-X1-type) families were significantly changed. Recently, a mutant library of 657 putative TFs was established via homologous recombination in F. graminearum, providing a valuable resource to study gene regulation in fungus [32]. Thus, it might be of interest to compare phenotypes of mutants for the 75 differentially expressed TFs. Most TF knock-out mutants show distinct phenotypes. For example, five mutants for which members of the C2H2 zinc finger family were deleted (FGSG_04083 and FGSG_12837) and Zn2Cys6 (FGSG_04901, FGSG_05789, and FGSG_09464) displayed abnormal phenotypes compared to wild type controls. Interestingly, the deletion of FGSG_04083 resulted in a hypervirulence phenotype. The expression of all five of these TFs was strongly up-regulated 36 h after virus infection. Two genes (FGSG_12837 and FGSG_09464) were highly expressed in both early and late time points. The ascospore was not formed in FGSG_12837 mutants, while that for FGSG_09464 exhibited increased resistance to oxidative stress.",

The nucleolus actively participates in a variety of biological processes, including cell cycle regulation, cell growth, stress sensing, and viral infection [34]. Moreover, genes involved in RNA processing were highly induced. These genes convert precursor RNAs such as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNAs molecules into mature RNA molecules.

Given that nucleolus localizing genes were up-regulated, it appears that the virus stimulates gene expression associated with nucleolus. As a result, the nucleolus produces numerous ribosomes to maximize viral replication. In addition, the virus might control protein synthetic machinery in host ribosomes to replicate viral proteins. Recently, proteomics-based studies confirmed the involvement of the nucleolus in viral infection and replication [36,37]. Previous studies have shown that RNA viruses can interact with several nucleolar proteins such as nucleolin, B23, and fibrillarin to facilitate virus replication [38]. Thus, it might be of interest to examine the interactions between nucleolar proteins from F. graminearum and FgV1-DK21 viral proteins in future studies. Although our data suggest that expression of genes related to ribosomes was strongly affected by virus infection, this might be a common phenomenon in hosts in response to various kinds of virus. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that ribosomes are indirectly involved in the replication of dsRNA viruses. Since little is known about dsRNA viruses, we refer to many results from single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses to support our data. The system for dsRNA viruses might differ from that of ssRNA viruses.",

However, there are inherent differences between that study and the present one. Specifically, our microarray data demonstrated down-regulation of genes involved in metabolism. In contrast, the previous study found that the majority of metabolites, including lipids and carbohydrates, were significantly accumulated [39].

This indicates that virus infection affects the transport of many micro- and macro-elements in host cells at the transcript level. Moreover, this transport system mediates cell-to-cell communication within the host via plasma membranes. For example, transcripts required for cellular communication were highly accumulated at 36 h, suggesting that the virus might first stimulate cell-to-cell communication in fungal host cells, which is necessary to trigger host defense mechanisms against viral pathogens. Indeed, a recent study reported that infection of chlorovirus, Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1, affects the transport activity of solutes via plasma membranes in Chlorella[43]. Plasma membranes are the first barriers to block pathogen attack and can transmit information and molecules between neighboring cells. Viruses utilize plasma membranes to interact with signaling molecules. A previous study suggested that virus infection causes depolarization of the host cell membranes, thus decreasing the transport of solutes by active transporters via plasma membranes [43]. The impairment of plasma membranes by viruses suggests that all materials required for virus replication should be recruited within the host cell [43]. Taken together, these data suggest that FgV1-DK21 might inhibit the transport of diverse metabolites via plasma membranes to the maximize energy required for virus replication within the nucleolus.",

These are known to be fungal-specific, and their functional roles are diverse, including sugar and amino acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, respiration, vitamin synthesis, cell cycle, chromatin remodeling, nitrogen utilization, peroxisome proliferation, drug resistance, and stress response [30]. The Zn2Cys6 family is the largest TF family in F. graminearum, comprising 309 TFs. Of the nine TFs that were differentially expressed at both the early and late time points, six belong to the Zn2Cys6 family, indicating that expression of Zn2Cys6 is necessary in the host harboring FgV1-DK21. Furthermore, the enriched GO terms for nucleic acid binding that were up-regulated at 36 h provide evidence for transcriptional regulation by TFs such as the Zn2Cys6 TF family (Figure 9). To characterize the functional roles of the Zn2Cys6 TF family associated with FgV1-DK21, it is necessary to examine the phenotypes of knock-out mutants. Therefore, the recently generated F. graminearum deletion mutant lines will be very useful resources for characterizing the functions of host TFs associated with hypovirulence.",

In addition, cAMP and the G-protein alpha subunit coordinate their activities to regulate differentiation and virulence in some fungi. We found that transcripts for genes associated with responses to cAMP were highly accumulated in the late stage of virus infection. This result is consistent with previous data that suggested up-regulation of cAMP levels in the fungal transcriptome by hypovirus infection [46]. Thus, we hypothesize that FgV1-DK21 attenuates the pathogenicity of F. graminearum via cAMP-mediated signaling and that this process occurs relatively late after virus infection.",

            "text": "Recent years have seen extraordinary developments in genome-wide experimental methods. Of these, microarray analyses facilitate an understanding of the dynamic gene expression patterns of target organisms during environmental stimuli such as biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, given the benefits of the available whole genome sequences of F. graminearum, we generated a 3\u2032 tiling microarray system covering whole genes. To decipher global transcriptional reprogramming in F. graminearum harboring FgV1-DK21 in detail, samples were harvested at two different time points, thus providing lists of differentially expressed genes early and late in the host containing FgV1-DK21 as compared to an uninfected strain. Numbers of differentially expressed genes at the early and late time points were comparable, but the gene lists differed, suggesting time-dependent transcriptional changes. Genes that were up-regulated at the early time point included those involved in protein synthesis, such as ribosome assembly, as well as nucleolus and ribosomal RNA-processing genes, suggesting that FgV1-DK21 strongly modulates translational machinery in F. graminearum to maximize viral replication. Moreover, the accumulation of transcripts associated with transcription, such as TFs, indicated that the transcriptional machinery, which is largely regulated by fungal-specific TFs, might be one of the main targets for virus infection. In contrast, genes involved in various metabolic pathways, particularly those that produce carboxylic acids, aromatic amino acids, nitrogen compounds, and polyamines, were highly down-regulated at the early time point (36 h). Interestingly, such components are closely associated with the host defense mechanism. These results suggest that FgV1-DK21 suppresses the production of such defense-related components until the transcriptional and translational machinery in host cells have adjusted to FgV1-DK21 replication. In addition, transport systems associated with membranes were severely damaged by hindering the recruitment of materials for viral replication within host cells. When faced with viral infection, F. graminearum tries to establish a defense mechanism by consistently up-regulating genes associated with defense and virulence at the late time point (120 h). Taken together, our data provide strong genome-wide transcriptional evidence of how FgV1-DK21 regulates the transcriptional reprogramming in F. graminearum.",
