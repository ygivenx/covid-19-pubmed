The correct structure of the S1 antigens was previously confirmed by reactivity of conformational antibodies, DPP4 solid phase and sialic acid binding assays [17]. Two weeks later, MERS-CoV challenge was performed. The experiments on virus transmission and vaccine efficacy were conducted in two separate boxes. In box 1, a group of llamas (n = 3) were intranasally inoculated with a 107 TCID50 dose of MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain (GenBank Accesion MK280984) in 3 ml saline solution (1.5 ml in each nostril) using a nebulization device (LMA\u00ae MADgic\u00ae, Teleflex Inc.). At 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) na\u00efve llamas (n = 5) were put in contact with infected llamas (Figure 1a, Supplementary Fig. S1). In box 2, the same protocol as in box 1 was followed but using vaccinated llamas (n = 5) as a contact group (Figure 1b). Each box was set up as in a previous transmission study performed in pigs [39].\n",

In-contact na\u00efve llamas from box 1 revealed evidence of infection (detectable viral RNA) 4\u20135 days after contact, with viral RNA loads and duration of shedding similar to those of the inoculated animals (Figure 2a). In box 2, only one out of the five vaccinated llamas (No. 15) had viral RNA in the nasal cavity to levels comparable to non-vaccinated in-contact animals, while the other four animals had very low levels of viral RNA (Figure 2b). Additionally, the viral RNA from this llama was sequenced at days 9\u201312 pi and used for comparative analysis of the S1 protein (see Supplementary Fig. S3). A substitution of serine for phenylalanine was found at the amino acid position 465 (S465F) in comparison with the inoculum isolate S1 protein (see Supplementary Fig. S3a). This mutation was also found in another vaccinated llama (No. 13) at 10 dpi. Interestingly, we identified the S465F mutation arising at 5-6 dpi in three directly inoculated llamas (No.1, 4, 5). Furthermore, the na\u00efve contact animals were also investigated and the same mutation was found in llama No. 9 at 10 dpi (see Supplementary Fig. S3b). To ensure that this mutant is not a neutralization escape mutant, the mutant virus was plaque-purified form the nasal swab of llama No. 4 at 6 dpi. The virus was sequenced (Llama-passaged-Qatar15; GenBank Accession MN507638) to ensure no other mutations were present in the spike protein and then used to carry out neutralization assays.

            "text": "In this study, experimental MERS-CoV transmission from infected llamas to na\u00efve in-contact llamas has been demonstrated for the first time. Consistent with previous studies [10], all MERS-CoV inoculated llamas got infected, shed infectious virus and were able to transmit the virus to all naive contact animals as assessed by MERS-CoV RNA and viral titration of the nasal swabs. We confirmed that 3 infected llamas were able to transmit MERS-CoV to at least 5 na\u00efve animals; nonetheless, further studies are needed to determine the basic reproduction ratio of this virus transmission in camelids. Interestingly, the three contact llamas shedding infectious MERS-CoV showed the highest viral RNA loads, while the remaining two had higher Cq values and no infectious virus was isolated. Altogether, taking into account that (i) viral genomic replication was observed in all in-contact na\u00efve llamas for an extended period, (ii) 3 out of 5 in-contact animals shed detectable infectious virus and (iii) one of them exhibited nasal discharges, this in-contact model of virus transmission is valuable to test vaccine efficacy. However, before stating that llamas can be surrogates of dromedaries for vaccine testing in an in-contact model, it would be important to assess whether infectious viral pressure elicited by the experimental challenge are similar between these two animal species. In that respect, in a previous report, two dromedaries inoculated with the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain shed viral RNA and infectious virus for 13 and 6 days, respectively [19], similar to what we found in the present study in llamas infected intranasally with the MERS-CoV Qatar15/2015 strain.",

Thus, the efficacy of an S1 recombinant protein emulsified with the adjuvant Montanide\u2122 ISA 206 VG was evaluated as a potential vaccine candidate. We showed that immunized llamas were efficiently protected against MERS-CoV infection; no infectious virus was detected in the nose of any of the vaccinated animals and viral RNA shedding remained low (Cq \u2265 34), with the exception of one llama (No. 15). Viral mRNA was also detected in the nasal cavity of this llama, which might be from intracellular viral mRNA from cells harvested in the nasal swabs; nonetheless, we could not detect any infectious virus. Neutralization of the virus by antibodies at mucosal level may have inhibited infectious viral particle production. The lack of detectable infectious virus in the vaccinated llamas despite being infected, renders these animals unlikely to transmit the virus further to other animals and thus blocking the transmission chain. In addition, our studies revealed a mutation (S465F) in the spike protein encoded by this viral RNA, which may suggest a potential escape variant being produced. However, the emergence of the same mutation in another vaccinated llama, in one na\u00efve in-contact animal and in other three directly inoculated llamas was revealed. In addition, the capacity of vaccinated animals to induce NAbs against this variant when isolated, indicate that it is unlikely an escape variant induced under antibody pressure. Mutation at this site (S465F) is not directly involved in receptor binding but has been previously reported to occur as a result of virus adaptation to its host receptor [46]. Overall, this indicates a probable adaptive mutation rather than a vaccine escape mutation.",

These latter antibodies may be important in blocking virus attachment to sialic acid present in camelids, as it has been demonstrated in the dromedary camel upper respiratory tract [45]. Importantly, serum NAbs were generated in all vaccinated animals after the boosting immunization and were maintained during challenge. Therefore, a correlation of NAb levels in serum upon vaccination and protection occurred, as previously described in another vaccination study in camelids [37]. Notably, we detected mucosal NAb in the nasal cavity of 3 out of 5 vaccinated llamas, as also reported in dromedary camels immunized with an MVA-based candidate [19]. In addition, we demonstrate that vaccination of llamas with a spike protein from a clade A MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 isolate) provides protection against a challenge with a clade B virus (Qatar15/2015 islolate). Since evidence of MERS-CoV reinfection has been reported in camels in the field [47], further studies to determine whether intramuscular administration of the subunit vaccine can boost mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract of animals that have been previously exposed to MERS-CoV are needed.",

Here we used the Montanide\u2122 ISA 206 VG adjuvant, which was shown to induce long-term protective immunity in large animal species by stimulating both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses [48]. Further studies should be conducted in target species in order to determine the optimal antigen dose and the persistence of NAb following S1 recombinant vaccination. In fact, here, two doses of 35 and 50 \u00b5g were enough to induce protection, as opposed to a recent study which used 3 doses of 400 \u00b5g of the S1 antigen with a combination of adjuvants [37]. Unlike vector-based vaccines, protein-based vaccines do not require safety testing in high containment facilities and field studies could be directly conducted; thus, reducing the cost of the proposed vaccine. The registered adjuvant used in this study, Montanide\u2122 ISA 206 VG, offers economical and practical use for field applications. Therefore, the S1 recombinant vaccine tested in this study appears as a good candidate to prevent animal-to-animal and, eventually, animal-to-human transmission.",
