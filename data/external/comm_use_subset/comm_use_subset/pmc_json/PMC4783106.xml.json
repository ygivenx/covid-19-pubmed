            "text": "Otitis media, may be simply defined as inflammation of the middle ear, and is the most common reason a child under the age of 5 will visit their general practitioner and be prescribed antibiotics in socioeconomically developed countries [1]. OM has a range of clinical presentations including AOM, which is characterised by the rapid onset of local and systemic symptoms, including otalgia, fever, vomiting and accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity and OME, where the child experiences MEF accumulation without the systemic symptoms. Both of these presentations may occur recurrently or chronically [2]. Globally, more than 700 million cases of AOM are diagnosed each year, with 50% of affected children being under five years of age [3]. Recurrent AOM (RAOM) occurs where a patient has 3 diagnosed AOM episodes within six months or more than 4 episodes in 12 months [4] and is commonly observed in up to 65% of children by 5 years of age[4] OME typically resolves spontaneously within 3 months [5] however, 30\u201340% of children experience persistent or chronic fluid in the middle ear for more than 3 months (chronic OME, COME) and may require surgical intervention to aid resolution [5].",

The assessment of risk of bias of individual studies was performed at the study level by the use of inclusion criteria. For example, clinical criteria describing the varied presentations of OM may have varied over the thirty years of published literature reviewed. Reviewing authors ensured that all published studies clearly differentiated acute AOM by the presence of otalgia and inflamed and/or bulging tympanic membrane which remain consistent characteristics within current definitions. Where vaccination status of the study population is unknown, comparison of the study dates versus the implementation of the NIPs was used to inform potential vaccination status. Only studies that sampled the MEF after clinical perforation of the tympanic membrane were included in this report. This criterion is likely to have generated selection bias on the basis of MEF collection being performed primarily for research purposes, rather than clinical or treatment reasons. The likely outcome would result in skewing representation to include more severe cases undergoing surgical treatment. In addition, there is a relative paucity of reports from some world regions.",

Collectively, A. otitidis was detected in 20% to 60% of MEF samples from OM patients by PCR, but was largely undetected using culture (Table 4). Furthermore, A. otitidis was more frequently identified in patients with OME compared to patients with AOM [18, 117] and, was the most commonly detected bacteria in the middle ear of patients with OME/COME, detected using PCR [18, 74, 117, 118]. The use of PCR methodologies has improved detection rates for organisms that are difficult to culture, for example, detection of A. otitidis within MEF samples from patients with OM requires more than 3 days in culture, thus PCR analysis of MEF samples has improved detection of this organism and has resulted in consideration of A. otitidis having a role in OM pathogenesis [58, 67, 74, 119].",

Widespread use of these antibiotics for the treatment of OM has contributed to the development of antimicrobial resistance. \u03b2-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae strains, have been isolated from the MEF of patients with OM in Mexico [35], Lebanon [76] and Japan [135].

Further research is needed to trial a number of already identified NTHi vaccine candidates, with respect to the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against OM [1]. M. catarrhalis has been recognised as an otopathogen since 1920s with significant increased detection occurring since the 1980\u2019s [147]. Clinically, M. catarrhalis alone appears to be the least virulent pathogen [148] and is often associated with the first episode of disease, a younger age of onset, lower rates of spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation [149] and increased likelihood of spontaneous resolution [125]. M. catarrhalis however, most frequently occurs as a polymicrobial infection [149]. In this review, where culture findings of predominant bacteria were identified as different to that identified by PCR methods, M. catarrhalis was the new predominant bacterium.Most studies report that more than 90% of M. catarrhalis strains isolated from patients with OM were \u03b2-lactamase producers, although lower rates of 40%-50% have been reported from Turkey and Nigeria [52, 53, 106]. Whilst several vaccine candidates have been identified for M. catarrhalis, development of a vaccine strategy for M. catarrhalis is at an early stage [150\u2013152].",

Depending on the region, and the detection method, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae vie for predominance as the bacteria most frequently isolated from the middle ear fluid from children with OM. A significant environmental change, the introduction of PCV7 and ongoing monitoring of serotype replacement throughout many regions of the world, continues to provide evidence of the predominance of these two bacteria in children with OM. Importantly, to identify and address the evolving development of bacterial resistance, such as \u03b2-lactamase production and potential pathogenicity of prevalent microbes such as S. pyogenes and A. otitidis ongoing monitoring is essential.",
