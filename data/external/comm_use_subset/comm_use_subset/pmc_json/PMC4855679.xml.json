In the Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice group, mortality became apparent at 5\u20136 h, and all mice died by 10 h. In the wild-type (WT) mice group, no death was observed at 6 h; the first animal death was observed at 8 h, and the survival rate was 60% at 24 h (Figure 1a). Based on the survival rate, additional WT and Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice were killed 5 h after d-GalN/LPS administration to obtain blood samples and liver tissues for liver enzyme and tissue analyses. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities were found to be significantly higher in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice than that in WT mice (Figure 1b). Histological examination of the liver tissues revealed more prominent liver damage in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 1c). In the Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice group, massive hemorrhagic necrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis were observed, with prominent vascular congestion and inflammatory cell infiltration. In contrast, liver damage and histological changes were found to be significantly less severe in WT mice. Then, we explored the impact of Per1 on non-lethal liver inflammation induced by d-GalN/LPS treatment. The results showed that none of the WT mice treated with 3 \u03bcg/kg LPS and 200 mg/kg d-GalN died. Administration of d-GalN/LPS at this lower dosage caused no apparent liver injury in WT mice. In Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice, the same dose of d-GalN/LPS induced significant liver injury, as detected by increased transaminase activities and histological changes (Figures 1d and e).",

The expression of cytokines in macrophages was measured by real-time RT-PCR at 3 h after stimulation. Unexpectedly, Per1 deletion had no influence on the expression of any of the cytokines (Supplementary Figure S1). To confirm the phenotypes observed here, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Per1 by electroporation as described previously.17 However, no changes in LPS-induced cytokine production were observed in either of the groups (Supplementary Figure S1). We next determined the number of KCs in the livers of Per1\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice. Administration of d-GalN/LPS significantly increased the number of KCs in both genotypes. Either under baseline conditions or after d-GalN/LPS challenge, a marked increase was observed in the number of KCs in the livers of Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with the livers of WT mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against the KC marker genes F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3a and b), as well as by the increased hepatic expression of F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3c and d). We further used flow cytometry to identify specific populations of myeloid cells in the mouse liver. The data showed a significant increase in total F4/80+ cells in untreated and treated Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3e). F4/80+ CD11b+ cells showed a strong capacity for the production of cytokines in response to LPS.18 The relative number of these cells also increased in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice, either under baseline conditions or after d-GalN/LPS treatment (Figure 3e). These results implied that the increase in the number of KCs in Per1\u2212/\u2212 livers may contribute to the immune response to LPS and to increased hepatic cytokine production.",

Local production of M-CSF in the liver has a crucial role in the proliferation and maturation of KCs.19 We found that Per1 deficiency did not significantly change the hepatic expression of M-CSF (Supplementary Figure S2A). A cell cycle analysis of peritoneal macrophages isolated from WT and Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed similar numbers of macrophages undergoing the G0/G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Supplementary Figure S2). An annexin V/PI assay was performed on macrophages harvested at 2, 4, 7 and 12 days of culture under routine conditions to assess the percentage of early apoptotic (annexin V+/PI\u2212) and late apoptotic/necrotic (annexin V+/PI+) cells. The WT and Per1-deficient macrophages displayed similar changes over time (Supplementary Figure S2).

FACS analysis revealed a decrease in total CD115+ circulating monocytes in the peripheral blood of Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice. The relative number of CD115+ CD11b+ monocytes was also decreased in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4a). This observation implies that hepatic macrophage recruitment is enhanced in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice. It was suggested previously that CCR2/MCP-1 chemotaxis is responsible for the mobilization and subsequent trafficking of monocytes/macrophages to the liver.6, 7, 8 We have shown that hepatic MCP-1 expression is significantly upregulated in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 2e). Similar MCP-1 mRNA levels between WT and Per1-deficient peritoneal macrophages suggest that the elevated hepatic MCP-1 expression in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to the increased number of macrophages in the liver (Supplementary Figure S1D). Hepatic levels of Ccr2 were also significantly elevated in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4b). Per1 deficiency increased the gene expression of Ccr2 in peritoneal macrophages (Figure 4c), and Ccr2 expression was markedly lower in RAW264.7 cells transfected with Per1 (Figure 4d). Next, a cell chemotaxis assay was performed on the peritoneal macrophages isolated from WT and Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We found that macrophage chemotaxis was significantly induced by MCP-1 stimulation. Macrophages lacking Per1 exhibited higher chemotactic activity than WT macrophages (Figure 4e).",

Vectors expressing HA-tagged PER1 and PPAR-\u03b32 were transfected into B6F10 cells. Immunoblots showed recovery of PPAR-\u03b32 from B6F10 cells after immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. As expected, we discovered a physical association between PER1 and PPAR-\u03b32 (Figure 8b). Addition of troglitazone (a synthetically specific PPAR-\u03b3 ligand)23, 24, 25 or GW9662 did not significantly alter the association between these two proteins in immunoprecipitation assays (Figure 8c). Finally, we used a series of HA-tagged deletion mutants of PPAR-\u03b32 and investigated their interaction with PER1. Our results showed that amino acids 1\u2013280 of PPAR-\u03b32 interact strongly with PER1, and a further deletion of 97 amino acids (1\u2013183) abolished the ability of PPAR-\u03b32 to bind to PER1 (Figure 8d), demonstrating that residues 183\u2013280 of PPAR-\u03b32 directly interact with PER1. However, residues 183\u2013505, which also contain amino acids 183\u2013280, could not bind to PER1. Despite not directly binding to PER1, residues 1\u2013183 of PPAR-\u03b32 may be indispensable to proper structure of PPAR-\u03b32 and its association with PER1.",

Loss of Per1 significantly increased d-GalN/LPS-induced liver damage, which is essentially caused by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and resulted in elevation of mouse lethality. We demonstrated that the elevated cytokine production in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to an increased number of macrophages in the liver.

It has been reported that the nuclear receptor Rev-Erb\u03b1 mediates selective circadian regulation of inflammatory cytokines.12 These reports inspired us to investigate whether Per1 directly regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune response to LPS. However, in vitro experiments revealed that Per1 has no effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice macrophages, suggesting the higher hepatic levels of cytokines in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice may be due to the increased number of cells responding to LPS in the liver. Thus, loss of Per1 markedly increased the number of KCs in mice livers. F4/80+ CD11b+ cells showed a strong capacity for the production of cytokines in response to LPS.19 Flow cytometry analysis also revealed an increase in the number of F4/80+ CD11b+ cells in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice, either at baseline conditions or after d-GalN/LPS administration. This observation also well explained the elevation of hepatic cytokine expression in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice without d-GalN/LPS treatment.",

Monocytes migrate to the inflamed/necrotic area and subsequently differentiate into mature macrophages.29, 30, 31 Even in steady-state conditions, KCs are constantly replenished by blood monocytes.32 Peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population of circulating leukocytes. There are two functional subsets among murine blood monocytes: a short-lived CX3CR1lo CCR2+ Gr1+ subset that is actively recruited to inflamed tissues and a CX3CR1hi CCR2\u2212 Gr1\u2212 subset characterized by CX3CR1-dependent recruitment to non-inflamed tissues.33 In this study, the decline in Cx3cr1 expression in Per1-deficient monocytes/macrophages could not directly contribute to the increased number of KCs in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown). Previous studies demonstrated that Ccr2\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit decreased macrophage infiltration following acetaminophen-induced liver injury,34 indicating that MCP-1/CCR2 signaling is essential for monocyte migration to the injured liver. Increasing experimental evidence suggests that the chemokine receptor Ccr2 regulates monocyte entry into inflamed tissue, mainly indirectly, by promoting the egress of monocytes from the bone marrow into the circulation.6, 7, 8 In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of Ccr2 is significantly inhibited by Per1. MCP-1/CCR2 chemotaxis activity was enhanced in Per1-deficient macrophages. Deletion of Ccr2 reduced the number of KCs in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice. d-GalN/LPS-induced severe liver damage in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice was also ameliorated by Ccr2 deletion. These results further confirmed that the increased number of KCs in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to the elevation of Ccr2 expression. The increase in the number of KCs in intact Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice implied that CCR2 may also participate in the replenishment of KCs in Per1\u2212/\u2212 mice under steady-state conditions. Although it has been reported that Per1 has an important role in the cell cycle and apoptosis in cancer cells,26 the increase in KCs may also be attributed to the influence of Per1 on proliferation and/or apoptosis in macrophages. Here, we showed that Per1 alters neither the cell cycle nor apoptosis in macrophages.",

Our results indicated that the effect of Per1 on Ccr2 expression was reversed by the synthetic PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist GW9662, which strongly supports our hypothesis.",

            "text": "The ChIP assay clearly showed that PER1 protein and PPAR-\u03b3 bound specifically to only the \u2013180/+16-bp region of the Ccr2 promoter. In contrast to transcriptional activation, trans-repression does not involve binding to typical receptor-specific response elements; however, PPAR-\u03b3 and transcription factors bind each other via protein\u2013protein interactions, thus modulating their transcriptional activity.37, 38 No potential typical PPAR-\u03b3 DNA-binding site was identified in the \u2013180/+16-bp region of the Ccr2 promoter, indicating that PPAR-\u03b3 represses the transcription of Ccr2 by interacting with transcription factors. According to previous studies,35, 36 NFAT and C/EBP\u03b1 can promote the transcription of Ccr2, and their binding sites in the Ccr2 promoter overlap with this PPAR-\u03b3 binding region. Therefore, we speculated that PPAR-\u03b3 may interact with one of these transcription factors and thus indirectly bind to the Ccr2 promoter. Further studies are required to support this hypothesis. mPERs have been reported to directly bind to nuclear receptors; however, they do not directly bind to DNA.39 PER2 has been reported to interact with the \u03b2-subunit of casein kinase 2,40 glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2,41 REV-ERB and possibly other nuclear receptors.39, 40, 41, 42, 43 PER3 interacts with PPAR-\u03b3 via an N-terminal region including both PAS domains and a preceding predicted helix-loop-helix motif.44 The recruitment of PER1 to the PPAR-\u03b3 binding region in the Ccr2 promoter implied that PER1 may bind to PPAR-\u03b3 and stabilize the association between PPAR-\u03b3 and the transcription factor on the Ccr2 promoter. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed a physical association between PER1 and PPAR-\u03b3. The addition of troglitazone or GW9662 did not significantly alter the association between these two proteins, indicating that PER1 binds to PPAR-\u03b3 in a ligand-independent manner. Further investigation revealed that PPAR-\u03b3 utilizes part of its DNA-binding and hinge domains (183\u2013280), but not its ligand-binding domain (310\u2013505), to bind PER1. This result further confirmed that the association between PER1 and PPAR-\u03b3 is ligand independent. Overall, the evidence indicates that PPAR-\u03b3 has an inhibitory effect on several pro-inflammatory cytokines via interaction with transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and STAT.38 In this article, we showed that Per1 suppresses Ccr2 expression through the PPAR-\u03b3 pathway but has no effect on the expression of cytokines in macrophages, suggesting that Per1 does not participate in the association between PPAR-\u03b3 and transcription factors that functionally promote the transcription of these pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
