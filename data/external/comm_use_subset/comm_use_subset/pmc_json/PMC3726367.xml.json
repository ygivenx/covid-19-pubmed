            "text": "Given the structure of the genetic code synonymous codons will yield distinct amino acid changes upon mutation. The extraordinarily large number of possible encodings in natural genes is to some extent restricted by two encoding biases referred to as codon bias [1,2] and codon pair bias [3]. The remarkable nucleotide composition of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome with an above average percentage of A nucleotides results in a codon composition that is different from that of the human genome [4]. Especially the more flexible third codon positions are preferentially occupied by A-nucleotides [5], which induces ribosome pausing and inefficient translation [6]. The bias of A-rich codons in HIV-1 is thought to be the action of host enzymes of the APOBEC3 family. On the contrary, it has been shown that the HIV-1 A-rich sequence is not merely an evolutionary artefact of enzyme-induced hypermutations, and that HIV-1 has adapted to rely on A-rich RNA sequences to support the synthesis of viral cDNA during reverse transcription [7]. Recent data have identified a novel antiviral mechanism within the innate immune response, in which human SLFN11 selectively inhibits viral protein synthesis in HIV-infected cells by means of codon-bias discrimination [8]. Synonymous substitutions optimizing for human cell expression reduces the antiviral activity of SLFN11 [8]. Synonymous mutation is thought to be selectively neutral. However, previous work demonstrated that synonymous substitutions can negatively affect the replication capacity of several RNA viruses [9], including HIV-1 [10].",

SAVE works by recoding and synthesizing the viral genome; the wild-type amino acid sequence is preserved, but the existing synonymous codons are rearranged to create a suboptimal arrangement of codon pairs [3]. Although the reasons are still not well understood, some codon pairs occur more frequently, and others less frequently, than expected [12]. The overall codon usage in a genome can differ dramatically among species, although less so among closely related species [13]. It is unclear why some codon pairs are under- or overrepresented. It has been suggested that structural features that regulate tRNA geometry within the ribosome may govern genomic codon pair patterns, driving enhanced translational fidelity and/or rate [14]. For example, as described by Coleman et al., the amino acid pair Ala-Glu is expected to be encoded by GCCGAA and GCAGAG approximately equally as often. However, the codon pair GCCGAA is strongly underrepresented and is used only one-seventh as often as GCAGAG [3].",

Mice immunized with recoded attenuated polioviruses were found to have protective immunity when they were challenged with wild-type poliovirus [3]. The mechanism of attenuation is unclear, but it has been suggested that translation is affected [3,11]. Since codon-pair deoptimization is the result of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of nucleotide substitutions, it has been also suggested that reversion to virulence is unlikely to occur. Furthermore, attenuation may be fine tuned by adjusting the extent of codon-pair deoptimization [3].",

Moreover, HIV-1 can initiate translation either by the classical cap-dependent mechanism or by internal recruitment of the ribosome through RNA domains called IRESs (internal ribosome entry sites) [16]. To explore whether recoding synonymous codon pairs will generate viruses with altered replication capacity, we redesigned different parts of the HIV-1 genome. To phenotypically modify the replicative properties of HIV-1, we recoded the gag and protease (contained within the pol gene) coding regions by introducing optimized or deoptimized codon pairs without altering the amino acid sequence. Gag and protease coding regions were chosen in order to explore proteins with different function, structural and enzymatic, respectively. When redesigned gag and protease fragments were recombined with HIV-1 infectious clones that lacked gag or protease, the resulting viruses showed significantly modified viral replication capacity in MT-4 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).",

In contrast, HIV-PminA, with only 15 synonymous substitutions (Table 1), produced a virus that had its replication capacity highly reduced in PBMCs (p < 0.001) and MT-4 cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 2). Of note, all constructs except HIV-PminA had a similar infectivity/p24 antigen ratio compared to HIV-Pwt (see time 0 on Figure 2A and B). This result was also an indicator of the HIV-PminA attenuation. No viable virus was obtained from HIV-PminAB and HIV-PminAC constructs.",

Gag encodes the viral capsid proteins and therefore has a very different role in HIV-1 biology from that of virus protease. Three hundred and eight synonymous substitutions were introduced in the 1 503 nucleotides of gag. No substitutions were introduced in the gag-pol ribosomal slip site or in the p6 portion of gag, in order to avoid lethality and/or the introduction of nonsynonymous substitutions. Similar to the results obtained with the protease variants, HIV-Gmin (Figure 1) yielded no viable virus. Again, the number of underrepresented pair codons present in HIV-Gmin (Figure 1) was reduced. Only the constructs HIV-GminA, HIV-GminB, HIV-GminC, and HIV-GminD, which contain 118, 97, 93, and 34 synonymous substitutions, respectively (Table 3), produced viable viruses. Similar to deoptimized protease sequences, these four constructs had a lower percentage of As and an increased percentage of Gs (data not shown). Likewise, the HIV-GminA, HIV-GminB, HIV-GminC, and HIV-GminD constructs had a lower infectivity/p24 antigen ratio compared to HIV-Gwt (see time 0 on Figure 4A and B), suggesting that they were attenuated. Indeed, these four viable deoptimized viruses showed a highly significant attenuated phenotype in PBMCs (p < 0.001). HIV-GminA, HIV-GminB, and HIV-GminC were also highly attenuated in MT-4 cells (p < 0.001) (Figure 4).",

No significant reversions were observed in the optimized HIV-Pmax. The average mutation frequency in the deoptimized viral populations at passage 15 was between 1.5-fold and 12.0-fold higher than that of the wild-type population. There was a good correlation between the replication capacity value in MT-4 cells of the variant at passage 0 and the observed mutation frequency at passage 15: the lower the fitness the higher the mutation frequency (Table 4). The increase in mutation frequency between the mutant populations and wild-type population at passage 15 was statistically significant in all deoptimized viruses (p < 0.05; chi square test). In contrast, the optimized HIV-Pmax did not have significant increase in the population mutation frequency (p = 0.2425, chi square test). Reversion was observed in 3 out of the 15 mutations (20%) introduced in HIV-PminA. Similarly, 10 (8%), 15 (15%), 7 (8%) and 2 (6%) mutations reverted to wild-type on initially mutated positions in HIV-GminA, HIV-GminB, HIV-GminC and HIV-GminD, respectively (Table 4). In addition to the reversion of deoptimized synonymous substitutions, many additional synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were observed (Table 4) (Additional file 4: Table S3 and Additional file 5: Table S4). Most of these additional mutations alleviate negative codon pair\u2013bias scores (data not shown), strongly suggesting that phenotypic reversion was due to the reversion of some initially mutated residues together with the fixation of new mutations. Especially interesting was the high number of nonsynonymous substitutions found in some deoptimized gag populations. For instance, the HIV-GminA construct incorporated as majority variants the nonsynonymous mutations R4G, P48T and K114R in both passage replicates, indicating that these mutations were adaptive. The selection of these mutations or other mutations was not observed in the wild-type virus. The R4 and P48 gag positions are highly conserved in HIV-1. The R4G mutation was rarely observed in nature and the P48T mutation was not found in the alignment of 4644 gag sequences from Los Alamos database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). Most of the nonsynonymous substitutions occurred in codons carrying deoptimized synonymous mutations, showing that the introduction of synonymous substitutions may allow the virus to explore an alternative nonsynonymous sequence space to improve viral fitness.",

These findings confirm the validity of using the SAVE strategy to attenuate lentiviruses ex vivo, in particular HIV-1. Our results provide also evidence that attenuated viruses may display decreased rates of protein translation of the targeted genes. After restricting viral replication to a single cycle by using a single-cycle HIV-1 vector, a significant reduction in protein production was observed in the vector carrying an attenuated virus variant. This reduction in protein synthesis was not accompanied by a reduction in the targeted RNA copy number, which suggests that translation, and not transcription, is implicated in the generation of the attenuated phenotype. Moreover, the lower RNA/p24 ratio found in these experiments for the deoptimized virus also suggests that there may be a defect in virus assembly. It has been hypothesized that the presence of a rare codon, marked by a synonymous polymorphism, affects the timing of protein folding and function [18]. This study therefore demonstrates that synonymous codon pair reengineering is an effective tool to phenotypically affect the replicative properties of HIV-1.",

A high level of preferred human codon use runs the risk of disrupting some unknown property of the HIV-1 RNA that is deleterious for other reasons, e.g. disrupting the secondary structure of the HIV-1 RNA genome [19] or increasing the number of CpG islands [20]. Importantly, in our study, a protease optimized virus carrying 38 synonymous mutations was not attenuated and displayed a replication capacity similar to that of the wild-type virus in MT-4 cells and PBMCs. This result suggests that certain neutral genetic drift is operating in protease synonymous nucleotide residues. Thus, in addition to explore virus attenuation, synonymous codon pair recoding can be used to explore other aspects of the HIV-1 biology. Indeed, synonymous codon pair reoptimization has been used to overcome adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep gene\u2019s inhibitory effects on adenovirus replication [21], to identify unknown functional RNA elements in poliovirus coding sequences [22] and to study poliovirus evolvability and pathogenesis [23].",

Of note, no genetic or phenotypic reversion is observed in a codon pair base optimized viral population after the same number of passages in MT-4 cells. Differences in the life cycle between poliovirus and HIV-1 may account for the above discrepancies. Alternatively, differences in virus protein or genome mutational robustness and evolvability can not be discarded. The different codon usage between poliovirus and HIV-1 may determine differences in their mutational robustness and evolutionary capacity [23,24]. A higher number of substitutions may better prevent reversion to the wild-type genotype. Instead, other HIV-1 genomic regions can be explored to determine whether other structural or accessory genes can be targeted with SAVE to generate recoded virus with a higher genetic barrier for phenotype reversion.",

First, despite the fact that reduction in protein synthesis was not accompanied by a reduction in the targeted HIV-1 RNA copy number, RNA sequences may be also targeted by factors other than those of the translation machinery (e.g. aberrant splicing, RNA decay process or miRNA targeting). Second, although we obtained a robust attenuation in PBMCs from healthy donors, our variants should be tested in an animal model, ideally the SIV macaque model, in order to demonstrate in vivo attenuation. Animal experiments should include optimized viruses to test whether these optimized variants are also not attenuated in vivo. Proof that lower replication capacities ex vivo can be translated into in vivo attenuation come from studies of the evolution of resistance to antiretroviral drugs, which is characterized by significant costs in ex vivo replication capacity [25]. Future work should include the immunization of animal models with different codon pair\u2013deoptimized attenuated HIV-1 strains to investigate whether recoded viruses are also attenuated in vivo and to determine their long-term stability.",
