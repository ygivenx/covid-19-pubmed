Emphysema among tobacco smokers often occurs in association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a complex syndrome typified by airway narrowing and inflammation, and diagnosed by the presence of expiratory airflow obstruction on spirometric testing [1]\u2013[4]. Nonetheless, emphysema and COPD are by no means invariably concordant, and many patients severely afflicted by one of these lung abnormalities may have little or no evidence of the other [2]\u2013[4]. In addition to directly attributable disability and premature deaths, smoking-associated lung diseases are also linked to many systemic abnormalities, including vasculopathies [5], lung cancer [6], renal dysfunction [7], and osteoporosis [8]. The abnormal and often pathological bone demineralization that occurs in smokers is particularly notable for being highly related to the presence and severity of emphysema, and is independent of the co-existence or magnitude of COPD per se\n[8].",

The pathophysiological processes that cause or promote emphysema and its co-morbidities remain enigmatic, although systemic immunological responses, including the actions of activated monocyte-lineage phagocytes, have been implicated in these disorders [11], [12].",

HLA haplotypes are major (and often the strongest) known genetic determinants of autoimmune susceptibilities. Finding distinct HLA alleles are over- or under-represented (conferring predilection or protection, respectively) within a defined disease population is a hallmark of autoimmune disorders [16], [21]. DRB1*15 appears to \u201cprotect\u201d smokers against the production of disease-associated anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. This result is the obverse of analogous studies in IPF patients, in whom DRB1*15 is over-represented among those with autoantibodies against heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a stress response protein with considerable sequence homology to GRP78 [21]. These disparate findings are thus indicative of biologically-distinct, antigen- and disease-specific autoimmune responses, rather than being a generalized epiphenomenon of \u201clung disease\u201d.",

T-cells are inert to anatomically accessible self-constituents in healthy subjects, whereas overt reactivity of these lymphocytes to a protein that is abundant in diseased organs (Figures 3A,3B) is a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of autoimmune disease [16], [19]. Antigen- (or autoantigen-) stimulated CD4 T-cells have protean and typically very injurious actions, including elaboration of numerous mediators that recruit and activate diverse leukocyte and somatic effector cells [21]. A finding of T-cell autoreactivity is very unlikely to be a benign epiphenomenon [16], [19]. Increased production of IFN-gamma in particular (Figures 5C,5D) is believed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of smoking-associated lung disease [11]. Furthermore, the GRP78 reactivity of CD4 T-cells in emphysematous subjects cannot be simply attributable to global, nonspecific hyperactivity, since elastin split products (ESP) were inert (Figures 5A and 5C). Although ESP was previously reported to be an autoantigen of emphysema [30], we have been unable to replicate those findings, and similarly negative studies have been reported by other investigators [31]\u2013[33].",
