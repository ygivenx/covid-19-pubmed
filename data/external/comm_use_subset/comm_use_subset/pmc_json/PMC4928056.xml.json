Gross phenotypic inspection of offspring indicated that all were visibly normal. Sgta+/\u2212 breeders yielded litters of normal size, with unchanged neonatal mortality rate, as compared to Sgta-intact litters (Table 1). However, the Mendelian ratio of inheritance was altered in progeny from Sgta+/\u2212 matings; irrespective of gender, Sgta\u2212/\u2212 pups tended to be less frequently observed than the expected ratio (22.49% vs expected 25%, P = 0.095). However, when separated by sex this was most pronounced for female Sgta\u2212/\u2212 pups (18.80% vs 25.76% for males, compared to expected 25%), suggesting that female Sgta\u2212/\u2212 mice were less viable during the perinatal period. Sex ratios did not deviate from normal (1.06M: 0.94F vs expected 1M: 1F, P = 0.38).",

            "text": "Having determined that Sgta\u2212/\u2212 mice are viable, we next characterised the functional consequence of the Sgta disruption. The Cre/Lox knockout strategy used in this study (Fig. 1A) involved floxing exons 4 and 5 of M. musculus Sgta for disruption by Cre. In silico analysis of the knockout strategy demonstrated that in the case that a stable mRNA species was transcribed, SGTA would be truncated at the TPR domain, generating a novel 27 amino acid sequence, followed by a stop codon, theoretically producing a 96 amino acid-long protein devoid of TPR-motifs (Fig. 1B). Efficiency of deletion was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1C). At the mRNA level, Sgta abundance was assessed by qRT-PCR using Sgta exon1\u20133 (\u2018N-terminal\u2019) and Sgta exon4\u20135 (\u2018Knockout\u2019) primers in the brain, mammary, ovary, prostate and testis. \u2018Knockout\u2019 primers failed to amplify product and Sgta knockout mRNA levels were dose-dependent for Sgta WT, +/\u2212 and \u2212/\u2212 tissues (P < 0.001; Fig. 1D). Homozygous Sgta-null mice exhibited severely blunted Sgta \u2018N-terminal\u2019 mRNA expression. Again, \u2018N-terminal\u2019 Sgta mRNA levels were dose-dependent (P < 0.001; Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that this strategy resulted in mice completely lacking Sgta mRNA, rather than a functional knockout. Complete ablation of SGTA protein was confirmed by Western blot analyses (Fig. 1E), but was apparent in a dose-dependent manner in WT and Sgta+/\u2212 as expected. In the event that a truncated protein was translated following deletion of Sgta exon4\u20135, its predicted weight would be ~10.6 kDa. Even when protein was subjected to gel electrophoresis using high percentage gels specially designed to enable separation of low molecular weight proteins (as low as 2kDa), no ~10kDa bands were detected (data not shown). The complete lack of SGTA protein was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in prostate and ovary (Fig. 1E) using an antibody raised against \u2018N-terminal\u2019 SGTA. We therefore conclude that ablation of SGTA protein in these mice was both global and complete.",

Body length was reduced in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 adult males and females as compared to Sgta+/\u2212 and WT littermates (P < 0.001), confirming that Sgta\u2212/\u2212 mice were proportionately smaller (Fig. 2B). Reduced adiposity did not contribute to lower body mass in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 adults, as neither the absolute nor relative mass of 4 pooled adipose tissue depots were affected by genotype (Fig. 2B). Adipose tissue cellularity was also unaffected at the microscopic level, as assessed by a pathologist (Suppl Fig. 2). Changes in lean and skeletal mass are logical contributors for this size difference. However, pooled absolute hind limb muscle mass, whilst significantly reduced in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 adult mice vs Sgta+/\u2212 and WT (P < 0.01), was unchanged when expressed relative to body weight (Fig. 2B). Skeletal muscle was also histologically normal across genotypes (Suppl Fig. 2). Likewise, absolute femur weight, whilst significantly reduced in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 vs WT adults (P < 0.03), when corrected for body weight, was unchanged (Fig. 2B). Therefore changes in lean and skeletal mass are unlikely to account for smaller body mass.",

Ar mRNA was unchanged by genotype in the prostate, testis, ovary, mammary and brain. To determine if Sgta ablation altered the localisation and distribution of AR protein, we undertook dual-labelled immunofluorescence staining of prostate and testis sections (Fig. 4D). In the prostate, SGTA protein resided chiefly in the cytoplasm of WT and Sgta+/\u2212 epithelial cells, with weaker intensity staining in Sgta+/\u2212 than WT, and no staining in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 animals, as expected (Fig. 4D). Conversely, AR protein was principally nuclear in WT and Sgta+/\u2212 prostate epithelial cells, with weaker intensity staining in Sgta+/\u2212 vs WT. However, in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 prostates, AR immunostaining was equally as intense as in the nuclei of WT prostate, but exhibited greater immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm than WT and Sgta+/\u2212. In the testis, SGTA was also localised predominantly in the cytoplasm of cells and was detected in the Leydig, Sertoli, spermatid and spermatocyte cells of WT testis (Fig. 4D). AR immunostaining was detected predominantly within the Leydig cells, with intense nuclear and distinct cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in WT testis. Partial Sgta ablation increased AR immunoreactivity, especially in the cytoplasm of Leydig cells, although distinct nuclear immunostaining was also detected. And finally, full Sgta ablation was associated with a visual reduction of AR immunoreactivity, especially in the cytoplasm, although some nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was still observed (Fig. 4D). Hence, some tissue-specific effects of SGTA dosage were evident. In order to determine if these changes were associated with changes in AR signalling, the mRNA content of known androgen-regulated target genes was assessed in the testis, prostate, ovary and mammary (Table 2). None of the AR-dependent genes measured were altered as a result of full or partial Sgta ablation.",

            "text": "In vitro, SGTA knockdown in kidney (NBE)34, cervical cancer (HeLa)5 and prostate cancer (C4-2B)26 cells reduces proliferation and viability due to impaired mitosis534, in association with defective cytokinesis34 and failed completion of chromosomal alignment5. Because of this, and the fact that Sgta is ubiquitously expressed and a wide range of protein interactions with SGTA are documented1, we hypothesised that Sgta would be vital for life and that its ablation in mice would prove lethal. On the contrary, however, we demonstrated here that viable Sgta\u2212/\u2212 animals were produced from breeding Sgta-deficient mice, as is the case in the knockout/down of conserved SGTA orthologs3233 in C. elegans, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae141533. The tendency we observed for reduced numbers of Sgta\u2212/\u2212 offspring in comparison to expected Mendelian inheritance is consistent with that of mutants for similar TPR-containing protein, FKBP52 (Fkbp4)4748. Given considerable evidence that SGTA is involved in tail-anchored (TA) protein insertion162249, and as TA biogenesis is essential for early development and genetic ablation disrupting this process has been linked to embryonic lethality5051, it is possible that aberrant TA protein processing may contribute to the reduced yield of mutant animals. The cause of prenatal mortality remains undetermined, however, in the case of FKBP52\u2212/\u2212, genetic background did contribute to the penetrance of FKBP52 action. That is, independent generation of FKBP52\u2212/\u2212 mice on C57BL/6J47 and 129SvEv48 backgrounds yielded lethality at 50% and 30% of embryos from heterozygous matings, respectively. Moreover, backcrossing FKBP52-129SvEv mutants to the C57BL/6 strain amplified lethality to almost 100%52; highlighting the caveat that the underlying genetics of a mutant model influence the phenotype presented. Whether a more pronounced phenotype of Sgta\u2212/\u2212 would have been observed if it been characterised on a different background strain of mice, remains to be determined. In contrast to FKBP52\u2212/\u2212, deletion of the similar protein, FKBP51 (Fkbp5), had no effect on early survival and elicited no apparent altered phenotype in mice53, although FKBP51 knockout (C57BL/6J background) in combination with FKPB52 deletion (129SvEv background) caused complete lethality in early embryonic life54. This highlights that redundancy exists in the co-chaperoning system. Consistent with this notion, FKBP52\u2212/\u2212 males developed normal testes, but displayed penile hypospadias53. Increased FKBP51 mRNA and protein expression in FKBP52\u2212/\u2212 testis, but not in penis, may actively prevent testis dysgenesis. In the context of homozygous Sgta ablation, it is possible that a structurally similar TPR-containing protein(s) intervenes, fulfilling the role of SGTA in its absence. Increased Dnajc7 (TPR2) mRNA in the ovary may serve this purpose, however the mRNA expression of 7 TPR-containing proteins was unchanged in the prostate, testis and mammary gland. Whether changes in protein expression and/or localisation of TPR-containing protein(s) compensate for loss of SGTA in normal physiology merits further investigation and could explain why only a mild Sgta-null phenotype was observed in the current study. A more overt phenotype may be induced by applying a stressor to Sgta-null mutants, as co-chaperones are essential for optimal folding/refolding and trafficking of stress-affected client proteins55. In yeast null for SGTA ortholog, Sgt-2, two distinct cellular stressors reduced yeast viability15, growth and colony formation20 compared to wild-type yeast. This further supports that SGTA is essential under certain cellular conditions and it is likely that its loss is compensated for to prevent dysfunction when these conditions arise.",

            "text": "In Sgta-null mice, reduced body size comprising a proportionate decrease in body weight and length was the most overt phenotypic change observed and was limited to homozygous mutants. Inadequate nutrition could result in stunted Sgta\u2212/\u2212 growth, especially as weight differences coincided with a phase where dependence on nursing is lessened. This appears not to be the case, as feed efficiency was unchanged in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 mice, albeit their ability to absorb and utilise nutrients from food consumed remains unknown. Whether Sgta ablation prompted changes in the signalling of hormonal growth mediators warranted investigation, especially as myostatin23 and the GHR12 are SGTA client proteins. Defective development and altered mass of skeletal muscle would be predicted if Sgta deficiency influenced the maturation and signalling of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass56; however neither muscle pathology nor mass were affected. GH, acting via GHR, is essential for somatic growth, cellular differentiation57, and paracrine production of IGF-1 36. Aberrant GHR signalling, and GH resistance, causes cessation of IGF-1 production and growth stunting. Despite both GH and GHR normally being expressed in early embryogenesis, growth changes due to altered GH signalling are only observed from postnatal d14-21 in mice3658. Dwarfing at 3 weeks in GHR-null mice is associated with heightened GH and lowered levels of IGF-1 in the circulation3658. Likewise, decreasing functional IGF-1R in mice (IGF-1Rneo) leads to growth stunting from 4\u20139 weeks of age, corresponding to a plateau in size, which is maintained59. Analogous to GHR/IGF-1R deficiency5859, Sgta-null mutants emerged as being physically smaller than WT at ~3 weeks and plateaued at ~6 weeks, at which time females were 93%, and males 87%, of the weight of WT animals. Similar to GH/GHR, SGTA is detected prenatally in the embryo, but its functionality during early development is not known. Given its interaction with the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif of precursor and mature GHR, SGTA has been speculated to prevent GHR interaction with ubiquitin machinery whilst being trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum, where precursor GHR resides, to the cell membrane, where mature GHR functions57. Aberrant GHR/IGF-1R trafficking and potentially ubiquitin-mediated GHR degradation could be triggered by Sgta ablation. We hypothesise that this may contribute to the growth stunting observed in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 mice, providing the loss of SGTA is not compensated by another co-chaperone. Lowered IGF-1 serum and tissue mRNA levels in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 animals may reflect defective GHR signalling, whereas raised serum GH and elevated GHR in the ovary in Sgta\u2212/\u2212 may indicate compensation for deficient GH/IGF-1 signalling; however, the latter requires confirmation at the protein level.",

Dysgenesis in sex organs dependent on androgen/AR-driven development were the leading cause of defective FKBP52\u2212/\u2212 male reproduction53, while failure of progesterone receptor-dependent uterine implantation conferred sterility in FKBP52\u2212/\u2212 females48. Increased surrogate measures (AGD, penis and preputial gland size) for androgen signalling in utero, both prepubertally and at puberty, in full or partial Sgta deficiency are suggestive of altered AR signalling and/or hyperandrogenisation. However, several other androgen-dependent organs were unaffected by Sgta ablation in males and females, as was the mRNA expression of Ar and AR-responsive genes. Regardless, an effect of Sgta ablation on sex steroid production cannot be excluded. In addition to AR regulation, SGTA also exhibits regulatory specificity for progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors160; thus the influence of SGTA ablation on biological processes controlled by progesterone and glucocorticoid signaling also warrant future investigation. Reduced nuclear AR immunoreactivity without a concomitant increase in the cytoplasm in the Sgta+/\u2212 prostate, is suggestive of Sgta, like other TPR-containing proteins TPR2/Dnajc7 and CHIP/Stub1, playing a role in AR stabilisation and/or degradation61. This appears to be the case for GHR12, where its stabilisation is not compensated for in an environment of partial Sgta deficiency.",

To assess birth weight, a cohort of female breeders were left paired with males and checked daily 1\u20135 hrs after lights-on (7 AM), and any newborn pups were weighed. Pups were weighed daily and any dead pups collected and genotyped for SGTA status and sex. Upon weaning (strictly at d21), pups were individually housed and food intake assessed. During food intake assessment, food and water were provided ad libitum. From d 21-105, feed was first weighed, then placed in the cage for ~24 hrs whereupon the remaining feed and crumbs were weighed.
