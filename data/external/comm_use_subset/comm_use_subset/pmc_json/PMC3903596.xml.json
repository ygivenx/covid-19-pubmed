            "text": "Viruses serve as robust genome delivery vehicles evolved to utilize an array of intricate strategies for successful infection of target host organisms. The key initial step is virus attachment to cell surface receptors, followed by internalization into the cytosol, targeting, and release of the viral genome to the replication compartment. Proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids constitute receptors for many enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Some serve as \u2018attachment factors\u2019 that concentrate virus on the cell surface and stimulate it to bind to secondary receptors or co-receptors that guide virus entry into cells. Glycans (complex carbohydrates) are the major constituents of the cell surface and may be conjugated to proteins or membrane lipid head groups to form glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively, or are present as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains attached within proteoglycans. The variability of the glycan structures between different species and between tissues in the same species as well as their exposed position at the cell surface makes these glycoconjugates excellent targets for virus attachment [1]. For most viruses that utilize glycan receptors, the binding is mediated by electrostatic interaction between the viral attachment protein and negatively charged sialic acid (SIA)-containing glycan determinants or sulfated portions of glycosaminoglycans. The virus recognition motif can be spike glycoproteins displayed on the lipid bilayer of enveloped viruses, or specific features, such as protrusions or depressions, conformed on the assembled capsid surface of non-enveloped viruses. The motif may be composed of a single protein or assembly of several proteins. The diverse interactions that occur between the viral pathogen and host, especially the recognition of cell surface receptors determines host specificity and tissue tropism. The pathway of entry into the cell and subsequent interactions influence the pathogenic outcome of infection.",

Bovine adeno-associated virus and human parvovirus B19 use gangliosides, adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1), AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, bovine parvovirus, H-1 parvovirus, porcine parvovirus, and minute virus of mice (MVM) use SIA, AAV2 and AAV3b use heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and AAV9 utilizes terminal galactose as a receptor [2]\u2013[20]. Sialic acid commonly occurs at the non-reducing termini of glycans linked within glycoconjugates and comprises a family of structurally diverse monosaccharides derived from neuraminic acid, a nine-carbon sugar. More than 50 natural analogues result from modifications to the SIA backbone [21]. In general, the C-5 position is either N-acetylated (N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Ac), N-glycolylated (N-glycolylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc) or hydroxylated (deaminoneuraminic acid; KDN). The hydroxyl groups on SIA can be free, esterified (acetylated, lactoylated, sulfated, phosphorylated), or etherified (methylated), leading to increased chemical diversity [22].",

            "text": "Two strains of MVM, the prototype strain (MVMp) and the immunosuppressive strain (MVMi), serve as models for understanding the role of parvovirus capsid-SIA receptor interaction in infection. Previous studies, in which pretreatment of fibroblasts with neuraminidase or proteinase K abolished MVM infection showed that SIA-containing glycoprotein(s) are required for cellular recognition [7], [23]. This requirement was further confirmed by glycan microarray screening [24]. Nam et al. [24] showed that both MVM viruses specifically recognize \u03b12-3 sialylated glycans with a type-2 Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc motif (3\u2032SIA-LN) and a Lewis X Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc motif (3\u2032SIA-Lex) with MVMi showing expanded recognition of multisialylated glycans with terminal \u03b12-8 linkages. The two viruses share 97% sequence identity in the capsid viral protein (VP) amino acid sequence and are serologically indistinguishable. MVMp was originally isolated from a murine adenovirus stock and replicates efficiently in mouse fibroblasts such as the A9 cell line, whereas MVMi, which was recovered from an EL4 T-cell lymphoma, replicates in mouse T lymphocytes and hematopoietic precursors [25]. The viruses are reciprocally restricted for growth in each other\u2019s cell type. Cell binding assays show that both strains bind to and enter the restricted cell, but there is a block prior to replicative form DNA replication likely due to a block in uncoating which is dictated by the VP sequence [26]\u2013[28]. Both viruses are however oncotropic and display oncolytic activity in vitro, and are both able to infect the transformed human cell line NB324K (SV40 transformed human newborn kidney fibroblast cells), suggesting that the restricting environment is eliminated in tumor cells. In vivo, following intranasal inoculation into newborn mice, MVMi is pathogenic and replicates in endothelia, neuroblasts [29], and hematopoietic stem cells. In adult Severe Combined Immunodeficient (SCID) mice MVMi causes acute leucopenia [30], while MVMp infection is asymptomatic [31]. The 3\u2032SIA-LeX motif, a known tumor cell marker [32], [33], has been proposed as the mediator of transformed cell recognition by the MVM viruses and the interaction with the multisialylated \u03b12-8 glycans, found in brain glycoproteins [34], the mediator of MVMi\u2019s neurotropism.",

All the viruses bound to glycans with the 9-O-methyl SIA derivative with the MVMp viruses showing additional recognition of 9-O-acetyl and 9-O-lactoyl SIA derivatives. Both MVM strains also recognized biantennary glycans with terminal 3\u2032SIA-LN motifs. The data verified that the surface properties of VLPs are indistinguishable from those of wild type empty capsids and virions, and validates their use in lieu of infectious virions to study MVM interactions with host cell surface glycan receptors. Glycan profiling of cells reciprocally restrictive for MVMi and MVMp (A9 fibroblasts and EL4 T lymphocytes, respectively) or permissive for both viruses (NB324K), identified glycan compositions consistent with those recognized by the MVM capsids in the SGM and previous glycan microarrays [24], [35].

Seventy-seven sialylated structures were generated incorporating 16 different terminal SIAs on 4 different underlying structures that were tagged with a fluorescent linker (Table S1). Each glycan was quantified based on its fluorescence and printed on NHS-activated glass slides in replicates of n = 4 to generate the SGM. The printed slides were washed and blocked with 50 mM ethanolamine in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) for 1 h, and prior to screening the slides were rehydrated for 5 minutes in TSM buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mM MgCl2). The virus samples were diluted with Binding Buffer (TSM buffer plus 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20) to give a final volume of 70\u2013100 \u00b5l (0.05 mg/ml), which was added to the slide and incubated at RT for 1 h. The slides were then washed with Wash Buffer (TSM buffer plus 0.05% Tween 20), and an anti-MVM capsid antibody (Tatt-2; polyclonal from rabbit) was added at a dilution of 1\u22365,000. The slides were washed again with Wash buffer and incubated with Cy5-labeled-goat anti-rabbit IgG at 5 \u00b5g/ml. The slides were scanned with a Perkin Elmer ProScanarray microarray scanner equipped with 4 lasers and for Cy5 fluorescence, the wavelengths 649 nm (Excitation) and 670 nm (Emission) were used. The scanned images were analyzed with the ScanArray Express software to determine the average relative fluorescence units (RFU) and standard deviation (S.D) of the four replicates. In the output plot, the y-axis represents the average RFU and the x-axis represents 77 sialylated glycans and seven controls (LNnT, NA2, Man5, LNT, lactose, fetuin, and biotin, see abbreviations below), corresponding to chart ID 1\u201384. To analyze the results, all glycans were ranked according to their signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio by dividing the mean RFU from four replicates by the mean background generated in the control wells lacking sialylated glycans. Variation within the 4 replicates was assessed as the coefficient of variation (%CV), which was calculated as 100 \u00d7 S.D/Mean. Any value with a %CV of >30, was considered unacceptable as reported in Song et al. [40].",

The profiling provided information on the carbohydrate composition of the glycans present on these cells (Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7), but full linkages (\u03b12-3SIA or \u03b12-6SIA) present in the glycans was not determined. However, SIA-SIA (multisialylated) glycans can only be linked \u03b12-8 or \u03b12-9 to each other. Of the two derivatives of SIA, Neu5Ac is the major SIA in these cell lines, but Neu5Gc is present in trace amounts in the N-glycan fraction for A9 and EL4 T cells, and in the glycolipid fraction for the A9 and NB324K cells (enclosed in dashed black box in Figure 4A and B; Figure 5A; and Figure 6A and C). The single sialylated O-glycan observed in the NB324K cells had Neu5Ac (enclosed in green box in Figure 7C).",

The SGM binding profile for the three types of MVMp and MVMi capsids tested, VLPs, empty, and full capsids, were strain dependent (Figure 2 and 3). The recognition of similar glycans by full and empty capsids of each particular strain indicates that the encapsidation of DNA by the full capsids followed by its maturation, i.e. cleavage of VP2 to give VP3 [43], does not affect its receptor binding ability compared to empty capsids, consistent with previous observations.

In addition, this hydrophobic methyl group is specifically preferred at position C-9 and not at C-8. This novel recognition is interesting, but its potential role in MVM infection is not known because this is a synthetic derivative that has not yet been observed in nature. Also, docking of a 3D model of a SIA glycan methylated at C-9 or C-8 of the glycerol side group into the MVMp SIA binding site localized to the icosahedral 2-fold region [23] did not provide any clues to this differential specificity (data not shown). The C-8 or C-9 of Neu5Ac in the MVMp-VLP-SIA complex structure is not in close proximity to any capsid surface amino acid residues that might affect the glycan binding interaction because the glycerol group points outward from the binding pocket (data not shown). MVMp and MVMi bound to the only Neu5Ac\u03b12-3 non-derivatized biantennary glycan on the SGM (SGM 48, Table S1). Thus while the signal was weak compared to the Neu5Ac methylated derivatives, recognition of SGM 48 suggests a strong preference for its structure which is consistent with the previous glycan array screenings [24], [35]. Significantly, this is consistent with the structures (based only on composition) observed in the cells that are permissive to MVM infections as determined by glycan profiling (Figure 4).",

Significantly, SIA 9-O-acetylation is up-regulated (e.g., 9-O-acetylated GD3) in human melanoma cells [49]. The enveloped viruses bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and influenza c virus require 9-O-acetylated SIA containing receptor for a successful infection. These viruses possess an 9-O-acetyl esterase activity that promotes escape of virion progeny [50]. Thus it is possible that MVMp can also recognize and utilize this SIA derivative for the infection of cancer cells. The MVMp viruses also bound to the 9-O-lactoylated Neu5Ac derivative (SGM 60), which are present in serum glycoproteins [51]. A role for this interaction in MVMp infection is not obvious at this time. These additional MVMp interactions suggest that the surface properties of the MVMp capsid allows for the binding of SIA derivatives that are not recognized by the MVMi capsid and that the type of substitutions at position C-9 of the SIA dictated this extended recognition. However, despite the clustering of MVMp/MVMi amino acid differences at the 2-fold axis of the capsid [44] and based on the MVM-SIA complex structures currently available ([23], and unpublished data), the C-9 position of SIA derivatives is not involved in any capsid interactions, as discussed above. Thus a potential role for these recognition differences in dictating the MVMp and MVMi tissue tropism is not immediately evident and requires further study.",

The restricted infection of A9 cells by MVMi is thus likely not controlled by this glycan interaction. Previous experiments have shown that a SIA containing glycoprotein (and not glycolipid) is utilized as a receptor for MVM infection [7], [23], but the glycan array utilized by Nam et al. [24] did not differentiate the origin of the GT3. Several recent studies have shown that \u03b12-8 multisialylated glycans, especially GT3 and GD3, are present on glycoproteins in the mouse brain [34], [52]\u2013[54]. Thus it is possible that MVMi viruses utilize an \u03b12-8 multisialylated glycoprotein for infection in neuronal cells. Multisialylated glycoproteins with \u03b12-8 linkages, such as Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM), MCAM (melanoma cell adhesion molecule), and CD166 (or Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM)), are commonly found expressed on the neuronal cells and could serve as receptors for MVMi on these cells [53], [55]. A profiling of a mouse derived neuronal cell line would aid in validating the abundance of and the possibility that MVMi utilizes \u03b12-8 linked glycans for neuronal cell infection.",

This similarity in glycan profile thus fails to explain the differences in tropism for these cells between these MVM viruses based on differential cell surface glycan receptor recognition. These observations support previous claims that the determinant of differential cell and tissue tropism for MVMp and MVMi is post cell entry [26], [28], [36], [58], [59]. These previous reports identified amino acids at and surrounding the depression at icosahedral 2-fold axes of the capsid, which differ between the viruses, as playing a crucial role in dictating these differences. The site reported for the MVMp-SIA interaction is a pocket flanking the 2-fold axis [23]. The observed similarity in glycan recognition by the two viruses suggests that the critical glycan interacting residue(s) is conserved. It is possible to envisage a scenario in which, following the initial capsid interaction with a cell surface glycan, an MVM strain specific interaction with a cellular host factor present only in the permissive cell line, initiates downstream events required for infection. These post entry interactions could also be under the control of similar glycan(s) on host cell specific glycoprotein receptors yet to be identified. These possibilities remain to be verified.",

The binding profile for VLPs, empty, and full particles was similar on the SGM which validates the use of VLPs in lieu of infectious virions for structural and biochemical studies that examine receptor interactions. Future directions include structural studies of the MVM virus complexed with the glycans identified in microarrays to elucidate the capsid-receptor interactions that likely dictate the similarities and differences observed for MVMp and MVMi. The glycomic profiling data correlates with the glycans that were recognized by the MVM viruses in a previous glycan screening and those identified in the current SGM, such as glycans with SIA-LN motif, SIA-Lex motif, the \u03b12,8 multisialylated glycans, and the biantennary glycans. The abundance and variability of SIA containing glycans on these cell surfaces, makes them suitable receptors for numerous interactions, as exemplified by the large number of viruses, such as MVM, for which this interaction is essential for infection.",
