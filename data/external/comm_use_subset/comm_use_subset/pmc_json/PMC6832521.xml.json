            "text": "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a common viral pathogen in cats worldwide. The prevalence ranges from 10% up to 70% depending on the cat population sampled [1,2]. Usually, FCV causes painful oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis/stomatitis, inappetence, fever and depression with a high morbidity, but low lethality [1,3,4]. However, FCV can occur as a very virulent form, causing severe clinical signs, due to systemic infection and inner organ involvement and high mortality rates up to 60% are reported [5,6,7]. FCV is a non-enveloped RNA virus with a high tenacity that can remain infectious for approximately one month on dry surfaces at room temperature [4], and for weeks at colder temperatures [8,9,10]. Additionally, the stability of FCV is strain-dependent, and common disinfectants do not inactivate FCV [11,12]. Viral transmission occurs via direct cat-to-cat contact or indirectly via fomites (e.g., food bowls, contaminated coats). Reports from animal hospitals encountering outbreaks of virulent FCV infections emphasize that indirect transmission is a key factor in viral spread [5,13,14]. In human hospitals, environmental testing for common human pathogens is routinely performed to assess the hygienic management [15]. In veterinary facilities or research catteries, nobody has so far investigated environmental contamination with FCV.",

All cats were group-housed in a confined university facility in four connected rooms (total of ~37.2 m2) under ethologically and hygienically ideal conditions [16]. All experiments were conducted according to Swiss law and were approved by the veterinary office of the canton of Zurich (TVB ZH095/15, issued 11 August 2015). After the arrival of the cats and prior to the start of the experiment, each cat was clinically examined, and blood and plasma samples and conjunctival, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected to verify the cats\u2019 SPF status. These samples were tested for FCV, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), hemoplasmas, parvovirus (FPV), herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) and coronavirus (FCoV), as previously described [17,18,19]. The presence of Bartonella henselae, Chlamydia felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma felis was tested [3,17,18,20]. Feline gammaherpesvirus (FcaGHV) [21] was tested by PCR with modifications as described in Novacco et al., 2019 [22]. In addition, the serum samples were tested for antibodies against feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus and feline coronavirus by immunofluorescence assays as previously described [23,24], and for feline immunodeficiency virus by western blot [25]. All cats tested negative for all of these infections prior to the start of the experiment.",

However, FCV viral RNA was also detected at the ventilation filter, which was not in direct contact with FCV-shedding cat; this finding indicated that there was the aerosol spread of the virus in environmental dust and cat hair. Although FCV viral RNA was detected on many items, we found no (or only limited) evidence of FCV with replication capacity in the environment, as tested by virus isolation in cell culture.

Consequently, environmental contamination was found on all tested items in the cat rooms that were in direct or indirect contact with the cats. Subsequently, a decrease in environmental contamination was observed, with fewer items testing positive for FCV RNA over time. Moreover, sampling of the environment in different places was standardized, and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Decreased FCV RNA loads were observed over time. This decrease in environmental contamination reflected the shedding pattern of the cats. Interestingly, the ventilation filter tested positive for FCV as long as the cats were shedding FCV. After the second experimental FCV infection with FCV 27, fewer cats shed FCV and the shedding period was shorter compared to the first experimental infection. Accordingly, the contamination of the environment after the second FCV infection was not as extensive as after the first FCV infection. Indeed, no FCV viral RNA was found on any of the tested environmental items. The lower number of cats shedding FCV and the shorter shedding duration after the second FCV infection were probably not the only reasons for the absence of FCV viral RNA in the environment after the second FCV challenge. During the first infection, only one cat was shedding FCV from day 43 until day 71. Nonetheless, environmental contamination remained detectable up to day 106 after the first FCV infection. Therefore, we hypothesize that the persistence of FCV outside the host could also be strain-dependent. It has been shown that some FCV strains were more resistant to disinfection with different biocides than others [11], and Lee and Gillespie 1972 [34] found differences in the resistance of two different FCV strains to changes in pH. Therefore, further studies with different FCV strains from cats with different clinical signs, including virulent-systemic isolates, will be required to confirm these findings.",

This confirms data from a recent study by Buckley et al., 2017 [35], in which it was shown that 30% relative humidity provided a better environment for the survival of FCV than 70% relative humidity [35]. The water bowl tested in our study showed an intermediate frequency of FCV positivity (53%). We assume that the relative humidity for FCV on this item was variable, depending on different water levels in the bowl. It was notable that the frequency of FCV positivity of swabs of the two litter trays was low (19%). Even though FCV is mainly shed via the oral route, there are reports of isolation of FCVs from feline urine [36,37,38]. Limited shedding in urine could account for the limited contamination of the litter tray. On the other hand, FCV shed by the cats could have been absorbed by the litter, which was not tested in this study. In a recent study, it was shown that the type of litter used could influence the environmental spread of FCoV via cat feces and litter boxes [39]. Moreover, the sampling method and the presence of substances, i.e., dust, litter, food on the sample might also influence the extraction efficiency of viral nucleic acids and in turn the result of the subsequent RT-qPCR testing. For further studies on FCV shedding via litter boxes, we suggest testing the cat litter directly and also testing urine and feces samples from FCV-infected cats to detect any FCV shedding via the fecal/urine-route.",

At that time, 56 days after the first FCV infection, only one cat still tested FCV-positive; therefore, we chose this cat to examine FCV contamination of the hair. FCV RNA was detected on one hair sample collected on day 85, but at no time points thereafter. However, cat JJH3 had stopped shedding FCV after day 71, which could at least partially explain why no more hair samples tested FCV-positive, despite cats regularly licking their hair during grooming. Following the second FCV infection, we collected hair samples early during infection at day 9. However, FCV shedding was diminished after the second FCV infection, and only four cats were shedding FCV at that time. Hair sampling was discontinued after day 9 because none of the hair samples tested FCV RT-qPCR positive. Although none of these hair samples tested FCV RT-qPCR positive, the fur of FCV-infected cats might be expected to be contaminated with FCV.",

            "text": "Although FCV viral RNA was found in abundance in the environment, no replication competent virus was detected using virus isolation; only minimal RT-qPCR signals were found in four of the cell culture supernatants. It has been reported that the number of viral genomes detected, and the presence of infectious viruses do not necessarily correlate [40]. In a study of viral genomes in mineral water, the stability of infectious FCV F9, but not the viral RNA measured by RT-qPCR, was affected by the water temperature [40]. The viral capsid could have been damaged by environmental influences resulting in replication incompetent virions that were nonetheless still detectable by molecular methods [40,41]. This could have also been the case in our study. However, it might also be that the viral loads in this study were too low to initiate efficient virus replication in cell culture; this does not exclude the possibility that the loads might have been sufficient to infect a cat directly. Even so, our findings seem to contrast with current literature. Clay et al., 2005 [8] could recover viable FCV for up to three days from dry surfaces, and in the study of Doultree et al., 1999 [10], FCV stayed replication competent in suspension or in a dry state for up to several weeks, depending on the temperature. However, the latter two studies on FCV stability in the environment used a different approach to that used here; first, the contamination of fomites occurred artificially and second, the FCV laboratory strain F9 was used. The laboratory strain FCV F9 has been used for many years for laboratory and vaccine studies, and therefore, has been propagated in cell culture numerous times. Prolonged culturing of FCV can influence the composition of the virus quasispecies [34]. Radford et al., 1998 [34] demonstrated that the evolution of FCV in cell culture leads to a reduction in quasispecies variability. Additionally, virus neutralization tests showed that FCV isolates directly obtained from cats evolved antigenically over the course of an infection, whereas, isolates passaged in cell culture no longer showed changes in their neutralization pattern [35]. Therefore, prolonged culturing of FCV isolates in cell culture could potentially have influenced the viral behavior in the environment and/or it could have increased the ability of the (recovered) virus to grow in culture. The FCV field strains tested in this study were derived from Swiss domestic pet cats presented to veterinarians with oral ulcerations, gingivitis, stomatitis, fever and depression. The two field strains showed low sequence identity between each other and towards FCV F9, indicating that they are all separate FCV strains [1]. The two field FCV strains were passaged and expanded in cell culture only four to five times before inoculation of the SPF cats in the present study. We suggest that artificial contamination is not comparable with natural contamination via shedding by FCV-infected cats in terms of viral loads and distribution of the contaminant. In particular, the distribution of the contaminant is a challenge for the sampling method in a natural setting. In contrast, in an artificial setting, it is known precisely where the pathogen was placed, and samples can be collected from that location. We tested those places we expected to be contaminated, since each cat had to interact with those places or items on a daily basis. However, in the present study, only a small fraction of the entire possibly contaminated area could be sampled, which could explain the lack of recovery of replicating viruses. The ten cats in this study had a total of 37.2 m2 floor space available, and the room was structured in a way that the cats could use it on several levels. We assume that this is more surface space per cat than what isusually provided for cats in clinical environments and rescue shelters. Furthermore, we assume that the sampling method might influence the number of viral particles recovered. Three different methods for the recovery of FCV were compared on wool and nylon carpets in a study by Buckley et al., [35]. On these surfaces, especially, macrofoam-tipped swabbing revealed very low recovery efficiency compared to the bottle extraction and the microbial vacuum method [35]. Although we also used swabbing in our study, we sampled only firm surfaces with cotton swabs. We assume that this is not directly comparable with swab sampling of a carpet.",

This finding emphasized that strict separation of the quarantine area from the rest of the facility is important. Additionally, the choice of disinfectant is also crucial for the success of FCV prevention. Here we used 5% sodium bicarbonate in hot water as a disinfectant against FCV; sodium bicarbonate has been reported to be effective against FCV [42], and was recommended as a safe and inexpensive disinfectant against FCV [32] that is non-toxic for cats and humans. However, it is not effective against many other pathogens [43]. Therefore, we additionally used glucoprotamin to prevent the introduction of other pathogens into the facility. Since glucoprotamin is not effective against FCV, we assume that sodium bicarbonate in combination with barrier measures was effective against spreading of FCV to the outer barrier area. Not only items in direct contact, but also infectious aerosols have to be taken into account when cleaning and disinfecting FCV contaminated areas.",
