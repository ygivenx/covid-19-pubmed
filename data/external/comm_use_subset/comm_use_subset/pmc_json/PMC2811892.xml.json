            "text": "The emergence of the new pandemic variant of influenza virus (nvH1N1) has brought renewed attention to the strategies for prevention, treatment and minimization of the social and human costs of the influenza disease [1-5]. The great majority of nvH1N1 infections are mild and self-limiting in nature [6-8]. Nevertheless, a small percentage of the patients require hospitalization and specialized attention in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) [9-12]. Many severe cases occur in healthy young adults, an age group rarely seriously affected by seasonal influenza [9-14]. While pregnancy and metabolic conditions (including obesity and diabetes) have been identified as risk factors for severe nvH1N1 disease, 40 to 50% of fatal cases have no documented underlying medical condition [11,12,14]. The new virus causes more severe pathological lesions in the lungs of infected mice, ferrets and non-human primates than seasonal human H1N1 virus [15]. The role of host immune responses in clearance of nvH1N1 or the role, if any, of host immune responses in contributing to severe respiratory pathogenesis of nvH1N1 infections is not known at this time. We have previously identified specific host immune response chemokine and cytokine signatures in severe and mild SARS CoV, H5N1 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infections. In these studies, early host immune responses are characterized by the expression of systemic levels of chemokines, such as CXCL10, indicative of innate anti viral responses [16-19]. Severe and mild SARS and RSV illness could further be defined by chemokine and cytokine signatures involved in the development of adaptive immunity. Interestingly, de Jong et al. have demonstrated that hypercytokinemia of specific chemokines and cytokines is associated with severe and often fatal cases of human H5N1 infections [20]. To determine if host immune responses play a potential role in the evolution of mild or severe nvH1N1 illness we performed an analysis of systemic chemokine and cytokine levels in serum from severe and mild nvH1N1 patients shortly following the onset of symptoms. Interestingly, we identified cytokine signatures unique to mild and severe patients.",

Ten patients required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to their respiratory situation. The remaining 10 were admitted to other different specialized hospital services. Outpatients had no difficulties with respiratory function, showing respiratory rates under 25\u00d7'. Sex composition was the same for both critical and non critical hospitalized patients: 60% of the patients were male (n = 12) and 40% female (n = 8). Fifty-three percent of the outpatients were male and 47% female (n = 8 and 7 respectively) (Table 1). Average age was as follows: hospitalized patients (36.6; 11.5), outpatients (29.7; 8.0) and healthy controls, (29.5; 13.2). Critical patients were slightly older than the other hospitalized patients (Table 1). Seven patients with critical illness and four severe patients with non critical illness showed previous pathologies (Table 1). Ten out of 10 of the critical patients, and 6/10 of the severe non critical patients showed a pathological chest x-ray within 24 hours of onset of the symptoms (Table 1). Outpatients had received just antipyretics (paracetamol) before sample collection (none of them had received oseltamivir). One hundred percent of the hospitalized patients (critical and non critical), had received oseltamivir at the time of sample collection (Table 1). Lymphopenia was a common finding in the critical patients (mean; SD) (358.5; 267.1). LDH levels were increased over normal levels in hospitalized patients, mostly in those critically ill (Table 1). Furthermore, critical patients also showed high levels of CPK, GOT, GPT and glucose in venous blood (Table 1). Critical patients stayed longer at the hospital than the other hospitalized patients (Table 1). Three critical patients ultimately died (five days after onset due to hypoxemia and septic shock; 69 days after onset by refractory hypoxemia complicated by systemic candidiasis; and the third after 75 days of supportive therapy by multiorganic failure).",

Consistent with our previous studies on early elevated expression of CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL4 in SARS CoV and RSV infected patients [16-19], we found in the present study elevated expression of these chemokines in severe patients (critical and non critical) and mild patients. The early expression of these chemokines in all patients likely is indicative of innate antiviral host responses.",

IFN-\u03b3 and IL-8 promote antiviral immunity but also respiratory tract inflammation by recruiting neutrophils and mononuclear cells to the site of the infection [28-30]. IL-9 is a Th2 cytokine that induces differentiation of Th-17 cells [26]. IL-10 and IL-13 show immunomodulatory properties. IL-13 attenuates Th-17 cytokine production [31]. IL-10 is known to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine. In a murine model, McKinstry et al.revealed that IL-10 inhibits development of Th-17 responses during influenza infection, correlating with compromised protection [32]. Increase of IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 in hospitalized patients over control indicated that they also parallel severe disease, but the significantly higher levels of IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 in severe non critical patients compared to mild (difference not found for critical ones), could reflect a beneficial role of these cytokines in this particular subset of patients. The patient who died five days after disease onset showed high viral load and undetectable IL-17 levels in serum. This could reflect a protective role of IL-17 in severe patients. IL-15, IL-12p70, IL-6 constituted a hallmark of critical illness in our study. These three cytokines also mediate both antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses. IL-6 is a potent regulator switching immune responses from the induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells to pathogenic Th17 cells in vivo [33]. IL-15 promotes CD8 T cells homeostatic proliferation [34] in response to infection. IL-12 plays a key role in the switch from innate to adaptive immunity [17].",

Alternatively, an increase in Th-1 and Th-17 cytokines may reflect a vigorous antiviral host response necessary for clearance of virus during severe lower respiratory infections. While the ability of influenza A virus to induce the production of chemotactic (RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, MCP-3, and IP-10) and pro-inflammatory (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1) Th1 related mediators is well know from previous reports on seasonal influenza [29,35], this is the first report evidencing Th17 response as a signature of severe influenza disease in humans [36,37]. Since there are immunomodulatory drugs which have shown to down-modulate the activity of both Th1 and Th17 [38], the results obtained here supports the development of further studies on animal models aimed to clarify the role of these mediators in the pathogenesis of the acute respiratory disease showed by severe nvH1N1 infected patients.",
