Ribavirin, which affects many DNA and RNA-containing viruses, was found to be effective, partially effective, or not effective against adenoviral infection. Ganciclovir, which is efficient against cytomegalovirus infection, is effective against adenoviruses both in vitro and in vivo [5]. Cidofovir, which is characterized by a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, is used for the treatment of severe adenoviral infections [6]. Ribavirin, ganciclovir, and cidofovir are more or less successfully used for the treatment of severe human adenoviral pathologies, including hepatitis, cystitis, and pneumonia in immunocompromised organ transplant recipients [7,8]. At the same time, apparent adverse effects and the ability of adenoviruses to form resistant strains limit the use of these drugs [9]. Some chemically distinct compounds, including lipids, acridones, and imidazoquinolinamines, as well as other analogs of nucleosides, also show anti-adenoviral activity. Virus reproduction in cell cultures may be inhibited by high concentrations of green tea catechins [10]. Interferon drugs used to treat respiratory infections are most useful for prevention and cannot be considered as the primary medications for the treatment of severe infection. As adenoviruses have effective mechanisms that suppress the interferon-induced antiviral cascade, they are resistant to the action of interferon and its inducers [11].",

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which can be found in the microbiota of the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, have a positive effect on these ecosystems as they stimulate the immune system and increase resistance to infections of bacterial and viral origin. LAB are the sources of multiple biologically active substances that vary in chemical structure and action spectrum [13]. During metabolic processes, lactic acid bacteria produce vital substances, including vitamins, amino acids, enzymes, fatty acids, exopolysaccharides, lactic acid, bacteriocins, and hydrogen peroxide, and significantly improve the intestinal absorption of micro- and macro-elements essential for the organism. It was also shown that exopolysaccharides that are secreted during the cultivation of LAB, in addition to their probiotic activity, can act selectively on pathogenic microbes and viruses without significant disturbances of the microbiocenosis and the development of inflammatory processes that occur during the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and chemical antiviral agents [14]. As a result, exopolysaccharides can be used as a base for the production of harmless, non-toxic and acellular probiotic products and drugs that have a targeted therapeutic effect.",

Adenoviral infection has been reported to have effects on the cell cycle. It is well-known that adenoviral E1 gene products interact with pRb (retinoblastoma protein), causing the release of E2F transcription factor, which potentiates transition from the G1 to the S phase, in which productivity is greatest. HAdV infection of a range of epithelial cell lines, including a primary cell line, causes G2 phase synchronization and cell cycle arrest [24,25]. This synchronization in the G2 phase may be a significant factor contributing to the cell-size increase [25].

            "text": "In recent years, there has been a tendency to use LAB exopolysaccharides for the treatment of infections of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary system, as well as cancer, allergic diseases, and viral infections [26]. However, despite the wide range of applications of lactic acid bacteria exopolysaccharides, their role in living organisms and their biological activities are not fully understood. The production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been intensively studied, and a significant amount of data describing their composition, structure, and properties have been accumulated. EPS producing strains were found among representatives of the genera Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, and Weissella. LAB exopolysaccharides have unique physical and rheological properties. As a result, they are used in the food industry as binding, stabilizing, and gel-forming agents, specifically in the production of dairy products. In recent years, much attention has been paid to the study of the biological activity of EPSs. In particular, it was shown that they have immunostimulating, antitumor, and antioxidant qualities. Since the biological activity of EPSs is strain-specific, the search for new strain-producers among LAB representatives found in the natural microbiota of fermented products is of great interest. Strains producing EPSs, especially in high amounts, are important for improving the rheological properties of the product and may possess possible health-improving effects for the human body. Previously, searches for LAB strains producing exopolysaccharides were performed. The isolates of LAB present in traditional fermented milk products, fermented fruits and vegetables were analyzed. Most EPS producers were found among representatives of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus isolated from pickled apples, pickled tomato juice, and sauerkraut. Therefore, the biological activity of these EPSs was analyzed in the current work. In the preclinical study of potential drugs, the first step is associated with the assessment of the compound\u2019s toxicity for cell culture (namely, the study of the effect of different concentrations on the structural and functional properties of the cells). It should be noted that most toxic agents act on the cell by interfering with the molecular mechanisms of homeostasis. This action can be expressed in a whole set of effects, which include changes in the fundamental cellular reactions, leading to destructive effects. We have studied the impact of EPSs extracted from lactic acid bacteria of the genera Pediococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus on the growth and division of MDBK cells sensitive to adenovirus. It was identified that EPSs in the studied concentrations are not toxic to MDBK cells, since they reduce cell viability only up to 17%. Also, the analysis of the effect of the highest EPS concentration on the cell cycle of MDBK cells showed the absence of significant changes in the distribution of the cell population in the G1, S and G2/M phases of the cycle. The obtained data allowed the use of all EPSs for the study of their antiviral potential. It is known that bacterial exopolysaccharides show significant antiviral activity due to the degradation of the viral particles, a decrease in the titer of viruses, the blocking of viral DNA replication, and the release of the infectious virus particle. However, the antiviral potential of these drugs has not been studied sufficiently. As a result, to investigate and exhibit EPS-mediated anti-adenoviral activity and to determine the stage of viral reproduction inhibited by EPS, various EPS treatment schemes were used in the work. Based on three different treatments, the results suggested that EPSs have a specific inhibitory effect on HAdV-5. The EPSs showed low virucidal activity and reduced HAdV-5 infectivity up to 85%. In most cases, neither pre-treatment resulted in a significant inactivation of virion infectivity. The inhibitory effects were observed only when EPSs were added to cells at the end of the virus adsorption period. However, only EPS 26a (produced by Lactobacillus sp.) reduced the titer of the virus obtained de novo and inhibited HAdV-5 plaque formation by 100%.",

            "text": "Currently, several possible mechanisms of the influence of lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites on the development of viral infection have been identified: i) inhibition of virus adsorption and penetration into cells as a result of direct bacterium/metabolite-virus interaction; ii) inhibition of late stages of viral reproduction and reduction of their infectivity; and, iii) stimulation of the immune system [26]. As a result, it was shown that probiotics can \"capture\" the virus of vesicular stomatitis (VSV) by direct interaction between LAB cells (L. paracasei A14, L. paracasei F19, L. paracasei/rhamnosus Q8, L. plantarum M1.1 and L. reuteri DSM12246) and the lipid envelope of the VSV, which leads to blocking of the virus adsorption on the cell. Similar data were shown for E. faecium NCIMB 10415 against influenza viruses and L. gasseri CMUL57 isolated from vaginal microbiota against the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The probiotics of lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus and their exopolysaccharides can stimulate the synthesis and accumulation of interleukin 12 to enhance the activity of natural killer cells and the synthesis of IgA in the spleen. Such activation of Th1 immune responses and the production of IgA determine their action against influenza [27]. In addition to direct interaction between viruses and LAB, bacteria synthesize some metabolites with antiviral activity. As a result, hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by Lactobacillus sp., plays an essential role as a natural microbocide within the vaginal ecosystem and is toxic to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HSV-2. Lactic acid, which is the final product of carbohydrate metabolism and is synthesized by all types of lactobacilli, is essential for maintaining the required pH of the genital organs, since it is known that the acidic pH of the environment inactivates HIV, and HSV-1 and -2. It has been revealed that lactobacilli can produce compounds that inhibit replication of the viruses. The L. brevis cell wall inhibits the replication of HSV-2 DNA in cell culture, while the acidic products of the Lactobacillus metabolism inhibit the activation of T-lymphocytes, leading to a decrease in the sensitivity of lymphocytes to HIV infection, which is especially important for mixed HIV\u2013HSV infections [28]. It has been established that some types of bacteriocins and exopolysaccharides have an apparent virucidal effect on influenza, HSV-1 and -2, HIV and Newcastle disease.",

The use of EPSs did not lead to the normalization of the life cycle of HAdV-5 infected cells to the level of non-infected cells, as the number of cells in the S phase was not decreased significantly (except EPS 48a) and there was no transition of cells into the G1 phase, which indicates the blocking of the mitosis in infected cells.",
