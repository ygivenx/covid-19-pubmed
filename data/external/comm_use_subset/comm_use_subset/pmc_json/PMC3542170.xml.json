Different control programs aimed to decrease the impact of the disease have been instrumented in many countries. Although the rate of success has been highly variable, it has become evident that a tight control of dog infections is the key element to arrest the life cycle of the parasite. This has created a demand for reliable diagnostic tests for canine echinococcosis as a tool to obtain epidemiological baseline information and help in the surveillance of hydatid control [2]\u2013[5]. However, accurate diagnosis of dog infection is complex and challenging, and other than careful necropsy of dogs, there is no perfect gold standard [6].",

            "text": "Parasitological examination of eggs is unsafe and not very useful because E. granulosus are morphologically difficult to distinguish from other taeniae eggs, and appear late (after the first month) of infection. Traditionally, screening of dogs for E. granulosus has been done by arecoline purgation, followed by examination of the purge for parasites by trained personnel. The method is highly specific, but it is tedious, biohazardous, unpopular among dog owners, and its sensitivity is modest, particularly when the parasite burden is low and bowel evacuation is incomplete [7], [8]. As an alternative, different laboratory tests for ante-mortem diagnosis of canine echinococcosis have been developed, including detection of antibodies in serum, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of parasite DNA and immunological detection of antigens (coproantigens) in fecal samples. Different studies have been carried out to explore the potential use of dog serology to diagnose the disease. However, the systemic immune response to the parasite is poor and consequently the sensitivity attained is also low [4]. Parasite DNA excreted with eggs, proglottids or cells has been detected in fecal specimens by PCR amplification using specific primers derived from mitochondrial DNA [9], [10]. The method has provided the high specificity of PCR, but due to the presence of inhibitors the DNA extraction procedure is cumbersome and the technique requires expensive reagents and specialized laboratories [11]. In addition, the pre-patent period of the infection, when there is no egg production, is a critical time-window that challenges the sensitivity of the test. Introduced at the beginning of the 1990's, the detection of parasite antigens in fecal samples by immunoassays became a widely accepted diagnostic test [12], [13]. The major attractive features of the method include its simplicity, the possibility of detecting parasite components even in the pre-patent period, and the fact that the target antigens (coproantigens) are highly stable. Samples can be collected in 1% of 40% formaldehyde and kept at room temperature for extended periods of time, facilitating the logistics of large-scale studies in remote areas [7], [14]\u2013[16]. The study of a large group of infected dogs necropsied at the end of the pre-patent period demonstrated a superior sensitivity for the copro-ELISA (83%), when compared to copro-PCR (26%) or arecoline purgation (43 and 77% after one or two doses, respectively). Most failures to detect positive infected dogs occurred when the number of worms was less than one hundred [5].",

In this framework, we have developed an immunoassay for E. granulosus copro-antigen detection under the premise that in addition to performing with high standards of proven sensitivity and specificity, it had to be robust, standardized and developed in a kit format to be available for its use in regional programs for the control of the disease.",

Dogs were purchase from local suppliers and maintained on commercial dog food and water ad libitum. Nineteen fecal samples (N1\u2013N19), corresponding to non-infected dogs, were collected two days after deworming. Then, ten dogs (identified as P1\u2013P10) were infected orally with 5,000\u2013150,000 viable (>80%) protoscoleces from ovine fertile hydatid cysts. Two additional dogs (identified as Th1 and Th2) were infected orally with 1 and 3 larvae of Taenia hydatigena, respectively. Parasite material was obtained from sheep slaughter in local abattoirs in Paysand\u00fa, Uruguay. Stool samples from each dog were collected daily during the experimental period, at the end which (27\u201330 days post-infection (dpi)), the animals infected with E. granulosus were euthanized for necropsy diagnosis by intramuscular injection of acepromazine maleate (0.11 mg/kg) and ketamine (20 mg/kg) (Laboratorio Holliday, Argentina), following by an intravenous overdose of sodium thiopental (Laboratorio Crusur Vet, Uruguay).

Out of this complex screening clone MAbEg9, in combination with polyclonal antibody PAbC4 (prepared from a rabbit immunized with E/S), was chosen because this antibody pair produced high signals with samples (ii) and (iii), and low readings with samples (i) and (iv).",

All E. granulosus infected dogs were positive, however, the readouts of the samples corresponding to dogs with small parasite burdens were significantly higher, but too close to the mean value of the negative dogs to give unequivocal results. The assay was then used to study the time course of coproantigen excretion during the experimental infection period (\nfigure 3\n). Using a cut-off derived from the analysis of field samples (see below), we found that dogs with high parasite burdens became positive after two weeks, and in spite of some fluctuations remained so thereafter.

MAbEg9 is an IgG; its reactivity with different parasite extracts is displayed in figure 1C.

Cross-reactivity with T. hydatigena coproantigens did not seem to be a major problem when the time course of coproantigen excretion was study with the Eg9 copro-ELISA (\nfigure 5\n). Using the cut-off estimated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves from the analysis of field samples (see below), only on very few occasions and after 40 dpi were some of the samples from T. hydatigena infected dogs positive.

Curiously, coproantigens in dogs P7 and P8 samples could be detected very early.

Upon necropsy, 9 of 85 dogs from Chubut, and 6 of 11 dogs from Junin were positive for E. granulosus, 48 were infected with other parasites and 33 were found negative, \ntable 1\n. Fecal samples from these dogs were tested using the CPR39 and Eg9 copro-ELISAs and the cut-off selected from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves [18] to have a convenient balance between sensitivity and specificity as follows: CPR39 ELISA = 0.224 AU and Eg9 ELISA = 0.340 AU. Using these values, the sensitivity of the tests were 80.0 and 86.6% respectively, which is in agreement with the results obtained with the experimental infection of dogs, \nfigure 4\n. The specificity of the Eg9 test was also superior 86.4% versus 82.7% for the CPR39 ELISA. In addition, the CPR39 test produced readings close to the cut-off for an important number of samples, \nfigure 6\n, which may be problematic for the use of a cut-off internal calibrator, because small inter-assay variations in the reading of the calibrator may have an important effect upon the number of samples that are classified in either category. Actually, if samples that fall between \u00b110% of the cut-off are considered as undetermined (a common practice), none of the samples analyzed with the Eg9 test would fall in this category, while four of the samples analyzed with the CPR39 would. While it was not possible to obtain an exact counting of parasites in the dogs from the province of Chubut, this was feasible in the case of the animals necropsied in Junin. Although most dogs had a large number of worms, two of them did not, and these two dogs were exaustively examined. We found only 9 E. granulosus and 2 Ascaris lumbricoides, and 47 E. granulosus and very few Dipylidium caninum worms in the first and second dogs, respectively. Interestingly, the average absorbance readings of the fecal samples obtained from these animal were 1.16 and 2.99 AU, which represent strong positive results, indicating the sensitivity of the test and confirming the capacity of the assay to detect small numbers of parasites that had been observed in the experimentally infected dogs. In this regard, when the E. granulosus positive dogs from the experimental infection are included, the overall sensitivity of the test rises to 92.6%. Despite the fact that MAbEg9 was selected for its reduced cross-reactivity with the ThSm antigen, most of its cross-reactivity was against dogs infected with T. spp (mostly hydatigena) alone or together with other parasites. Only one dog infected with T. canis (1.44 AU) and one of the non-infected dogs (0.694 AU) from the province of Chubut were classified as positive with the Eg9 ELISA, \nfigure 6\n. The relatively high readings of these two samples are unexpected. Based on the results of the experimental infection of dogs and the fact that all other samples (19) from dogs harboring T. canis alone or together with Dipylidium caninum showed very low readings, a misdiagnosis at necropsy can not be discarded. It is worth noting that cross-reactivity was essentially against Taenia. Despite the fact that we could not identify to species all field samples, the great majority of samples from Chubut and all from Junin corresponded to T. hydatigena; hence most false positive results will be related to dogs eating offal.",

For several different formulations (only two shown in \nfigure 7D\n) all of them rapidly lost the enzymatic activity at 37\u00b0C, but using PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Kathon, 0.1 mM TMB, the conjugate remained stable for up to 150 days at room temperature (or 4\u00b0C, not shown). Overall, we can conclude that even at room temperature the kit has a safe shelf life of 3 months, which can surely be extended upon refrigeration, which is a convenient advantage for the shipment and use of the kit in remote places. Due to the availability of commercial ready-to-use TMB substrate solutions, the preparation of this kit component was not pursued in this study. In case of high demand of the kit, it will be necessary to prepare new PAb. In our experience, this is a critical component of the test, but we have selected similarly performing PAbs from a panel of 3 to 4 immunized rabbits, after initial selection with fecal samples from dogs harboring low number of E. granulosus parasites and counter selection with samples from T. hydatigena infected dogs.",

To this end, 52 fecal samples collected in the province of Junin, Peru were processed as described, and aliquots were distributed to two laboratories (INS and DIGESA) in Lima, Peru, where the copro-ELISA kit had been transferred, and to our laboratory in Uruguay (Facultad de Qu\u00edmica). The samples were independently analyzed by the three laboratories and classified as positive, negative or uncertain if their readout felt within the calibrator absorbance reading \u00b110% range. Twenty four samples were positive, indicating a prevalence of 46.1% in the studied areas (Canchayllo and Jauja). The kit performed with excellent reproducibility and all individual samples were equally classified by the three laboratories with the exception of two of the samples with readings close to the cut-off, one of them categorized as negative by two of the labs and uncertain by the third one, and another sample classified as (weak) positive by two of the labs and uncertain by the remaining one.",

The Eg9 test performed with high sensitivity (92.6%) and good specificity (86.4%). These parameters are closely similar to previously reported values for other tests. However, it is very important to keep in mind that the only trustworthy comparison of tests is that obtained with a common panel of samples assayed under identical conditions, which highlights the need of inter-laboratory studies to compare the performance of existing test. The test cross-reactivity was low, and in addition, since it was basically restricted to T. hydatigena, most false positive results will still indicate access of dogs to offal. A major contribution of our study is the use of a well-characterized MAb that assures availability and batch-to-batch reproducibility, as well as the formulation of the assay in a kit format with extended shelf life. The Eg9 test is being shared with other control programs in the region and we hope that it will help to monitor the progress of control programs and standardize the epidemiological baseline information in the region.",
