IFITMs belong to the CD225/pfam04505 or \u201cdispanin\u201d protein superfamily (http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF04505) (3) that contains more than 2,000 members, including both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, all of which encode a conserved CD225 protein domain.",

            "text": "As their name suggests, IFITMs are membrane proteins, allowing them to police the cell surface and endocytic membranes that viruses must cross to invade cells. Studies of IFITM topology suggest a type II transmembrane configuration with a cytosolic N terminus, cytosolic conserved intracellular loop (CIL) domain, transmembrane domain, and extracellular (or intraluminal) C terminus (4, 5), although there is evidence that other IFITM topologies exist (6, 7, 8). The results of spectroscopic topological studies agree with the type II transmembrane configuration, as do bioinformatic predictions of IFITM3 secondary structure that reveal three alpha helices, with the C-terminal helix forming a single transmembrane domain (9, 10). The CD225 domain is highly conserved among IFITMs and comprises an intramembrane domain (IMD) and CIL domain. The hydrophobic IMD contains a 10-residue amphipathic helix (amino acid residues 59\u201368 of human IFITM3) that is required for the antiviral activity of both IFITM3 and IFITM1 (9). The subcellular localization of IFITMs is a key determinant of their antiviral profile. When expressed singly, IFITM3 and IFITM2 preferentially localize to early and late endosomes and lysosomes, restricting viruses that enter via these endolysosomal compartments. In contrast, IFITM1 primarily localizes at the cell surface and can restrict viruses that enter through the plasma membrane (11, 12, 13, 14). Indeed, mutants of IFITM3 that lack an N-terminal endocytic sorting motif 20YEML23 localize to the plasma membrane and lose their ability to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV), alphavirus, and coronavirus infection by endosomal routes (14, 15, 16, 17, 18).",

            "text": "Studies focusing on IFITM3 restriction of IAV and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) indicate that virus internalization is unaffected by IFITM3 expression and, for SFV at least, the viral envelope glycoprotein undergoes low pH-induced conformational changes (14). However, for both viruses, the viral core components are not delivered to the cytoplasm, suggesting that membrane fusion fails. Experiments with IAV indicate that hemifusion (i.e., lipid-mixing between viral and cellular membranes) can occur in the presence of IFITM3, but the subsequent formation of a fusion pore is inhibited (13, 19). Recent work has shown that IFITM3-positive vesicles fuse with incoming virus-bearing vesicles before hemifusion and that IFITM3 enhances the rate of virus trafficking to lysosomes (20). The co-localization of viral cargo with IFITM3-positive endosomes is specific to restricted viruses, suggesting that IFITM-insensitive viruses such as Lassa virus enter via different endosomal compartments and thereby escape IFITM engagement and restriction (13, 20). Further examples of virus-specific IFITM action include the ability of murine IFITM6 to restrict filoviruses, but not IAV (21), and amino acids within the IFITM3 CIL domain that are preferentially needed for IAV but not dengue virus restriction (22). Other post-entry mechanisms for IFITM3 restriction have also been proposed (23, 24, 25).",

            "text": "IFITMs are heavily regulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs). One major modification is S-palmitoylation, a reversible 16-carbon lipid PTM that increases protein hydrophobicity and influences the behavior of proteins in membrane environments (26). For human and murine IFITM3, S-palmitoylation can occur on cysteine residues 71, 72, and 105 and enhances IFITM3 antiviral activity (27, 28). Recent live-cell imaging showed that abrogating C72 palmitoylation slowed IFITM3 trafficking to membrane compartments containing IAV particles (20). Multiple zinc finger DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) domain\u2013containing palmitoyltransferases (ZDHHCs) can palmitoylate IFITM3 with marked functional redundancy, although ZDHHC20 may be particularly important (29). For human IFITM3, C72 is also the dominant site for acylation (30). Three other PTMs have also been reported, all of which negatively regulate IFITM3 antiviral activity: ubiquitination on one or more of four lysine residues (27), methylation on K88 (31), and phosphorylation on Y20 (15, 16). IFITM3 also forms homo- and hetero-oligomers. Although these are thought to require amino acids F75 and F78 (22), a recent study reported that these residues are required for antiviral activity but not for IFITM3-IFITM3 interactions (32). In tissue culture systems at least, IFITM3, IFITM2, and IFITM1 restrict viruses in a cooperative manner, with the extent of cooperativity and redundancy between IFITMs varying for different viruses (20, 22). However, the biochemical mechanisms and molecular determinants by which IFITM proteins restrict virus infection are still far from clear.",

Ifitm3 knockout mice show enhanced morbidity after infection with IAV, alphaviruses, and flaviviruses (33, 34, 35, 36), and in humans, single nucleotide polymorphisms in IFITM3, which may act by altering IFITM3 expression or subcellular distribution, have been associated with an increase in morbidity in IAV and HIV-1 infections (recently reviewed by references 37 and 38). Antiviral function has also been reported for IFITMs from diverse mammalian and avian species (39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44), although little is known about the role of IFITMs in antiviral defense in these species and in shaping host range. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the IFITM gene family is evolutionarily conserved and characterized by gene duplication, copy number variation, and the presence of pseudogenes (2, 45). Whereas humans possess a single IFITM3 gene, a remarkable multiplicity of IFITM3-like genes exists in the genomes of some other primates; for example, there are 25 IFITM3-like variants in the marmoset and eight in the African green monkey (2, 46). Interestingly, several of these variants contain N-terminal polymorphisms which, when inserted into human IFITM3, prevent ubiquitination and endocytosis; however, the function of these duplicated IFITM3-like genes has not been tested (46).",

Indeed, a recent analysis showed that bats host a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than other mammalian orders (47). Moreover, Chiroptera are the only mammalian order that harbor significantly more zoonotic viruses than predicted from reporting effort and host traits such as geographic range and mammal sympatry. It is possible that this propensity to be reservoirs for a large number of viruses, many of which may remain asymptomatic, in part reflects aspects of bat immunology (48, 49, 50, 51, 52). Hence, the study of Chiropteran antiviral effectors, such as IFITMs, can potentially reveal mechanisms of viral tolerance as well as the evolutionary signatures of virus\u2013host co-evolution. We previously showed that microbat IFITM3 retains sequence motifs for endocytosis and PTM, traffics to the plasma membrane before endocytic uptake, co-localizes with endosomal markers, and at normal expression levels in primary microbat cells, inhibits infection by pH-dependent enveloped viruses (39).",

In most cases, there are little data to differentiate functional from nonfunctional IFITM-like genes. Therefore, to assess possible selection pressures, we performed phylogenetic analysis on a selection of mammalian IR-IFITM genes for which there is evidence of function (Table S1): this data set comprises 31 IFITMs from 17 species, including eight Chiropteran species (Fig 2A). The selection pressures acting on these IFITM genes were assessed through analyses of the numbers of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions per site, with dN > dS indicative of positive selection (i.e., adaptive evolution), performed using the adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood method (56) that is able to determine selection pressures acting on specific branches of the input phylogeny. This analysis revealed that 6.8% of the codons in the sequence alignment were strongly positively selected on the branch leading to all Chiropteran IFITMs, with a dN > dS of infinity (Likelihood ratio test = 14.95; P = 0.002).",

A further three amino acids occur in IFITM proteins with confirmed antiviral activity: F (in mouse IFITM3 and IFITM1), A (in mouse IFITM2), and G (in mouse IFITM6; not used in the phylogenetic analysis).

Flow cytometry was used to determine the proportion of infected cells after single cycle infection, and a representative experiment of three independent experiments is shown (Fig 3A\u2013C). Each of the huIFITM3 codon 70 mutants restricted ZIKV infectivity with similar potency as wt huIFITM3 and wt mbIFITM3 (all <4% infection at an MOI of 10 and <1% infection at an MOI of 1). In contrast, mbIFITM3 P70W was significantly less restrictive than wt (35% ZIKV infection at an MOI of 10 and 7% at an MOI of 1) (Fig 3A). Similarly, small variations in infectivity of both SFV (Fig 3B) and IAV (Fig 3C) were apparent for the huIFITM3 codon 70 mutants, whereas infectivity of both viruses was markedly higher in cells expressing mbIFITM3 P70W compared with wt mbIFITM3. Expression levels of wt mbIFITM3 and mbIFITM3 P70W were comparable when analyzed by Western blotting (Figs 3A and B, S1A, and B) and flow cytometry (Fig S1C and D). Thus, differences in expression do not account for the different antiviral activities of these proteins. Using multi-cycle IAV infection, we investigated the impact on infectious yields and found that cells expressing mbIFITM3 P70W gave eightfold greater IAV titres than cells expressing wt mbIFITM3 (Fig 3D). Overall, the P70W substitution in mbIFITM3 significantly reduces restriction of representatives of three different virus families that enter cells via pH-dependent fusion from endosomes.",

In fixed and permeabilized cells, wt huIFITM3 and mbIFITM3 had a punctate intracellular distribution, as described previously (5, 39), and huIFITM3 P70W showed a similar localization (Fig 4). In contrast, mbIFITM3 P70W showed a different distribution, with prominent perinuclear Golgi-like labelling (Fig 4A, permeabilized). When cells were labelled in the absence of detergent (Fig 4A, intact), some wt huIFITM3 was detected at the cell surface, as reported previously (5), and this was similar for huIFITM3 P70W. The strong cell surface labelling seen for wt mbIFITM3 was much reduced for mbIFITM3 P70W (Fig 4A, intact), suggesting reduced trafficking to the plasma membrane. To examine IFITM3 trafficking to the cell surface, the cells were incubated in medium containing anti-HA mAb at 37\u00b0C for 60 min before fixation with or without permeabilization (Fig 4B) to reveal internalised or cell surface anti-HA antibodies, respectively. In cells expressing huIFITM3s, similar intracellular punctate labelling was observed on permeabilized cells, suggesting that equivalent trafficking to the cell surface and subsequent endocytosis occurred for both wt and huIFITM3 P70W. Consistent with this, similar levels of cell surface labelling were seen for both proteins on intact cells. Significant intracellular labelling (permeabilized cells) and cell surface labelling (intact cells) was seen on cells expressing wt mbIFITM3, but very little internal or cell surface staining was seen for cells expressing mbIFITM3 P70W. Together, these data indicate that the P70W mutation in mbIFITM3 significantly reduces trafficking of the protein to the cell surface and, as a consequence, there is little subsequent endocytic uptake of the protein into endosomal compartments.",

Therefore, we assessed S-palmitoylation levels of wt and codon 70 mutants of hu and mbIFITM3 using a protocol based on the acyl-PEG exchange (APE) method developed by Percher et al (30, 57) in which we used maleimide-functionalised biotin to selectively substitute S-acylations (Fig S3A). Treatment of these samples with streptavidin induces a mass shift of the biotinylated proteins detectable by Western blotting (Fig S3B). Thereby, the intensity of the shifted band correlates with the amount of S-acylated protein. Whole cell lysates from IFITM3-expressing stable A549 cells were subject to the acyl exchange workflow (Fig S3A) and streptavidin treatment. After SDS\u2013PAGE and anti-HA Western blotting, a band was observed that migrated at \u223c75 kDa (Fig 5B), which is consistent with the expected size of one streptavidin (Molecular Weight [MW] \u223c60 kDa) bound to one IFITM3-HA (MW \u223c15 kDa). Hence, this band represents S-palmitoylated IFITM3 present in the A549 cell lysates. The high MW band was dependent both on the presence of streptavidin and the addition of NH2OH (Fig S3B). Furthermore, titrating streptavidin showed that the amount used in this study was non-limiting (Fig S3B). Blurred bands at higher MW above the predominant 75 kDa band (Figs 5B and S3B) likely represent binding of additional streptavidin molecules to the second and/or third cysteine residue. Therefore, the entire area at and above the 75 kDa band was used for the densitometric analysis. Triplicate lysates for each cell line were subjected to acyl exchange, independent SDS\u2013PAGE, and anti-HA blotting. Densitometry was then performed in Image J to determine the proportion of each IFITM3 protein that was S-palmitoylated, that is, (HA signal \u2265 75 kDa)/(total HA signal in lane) (Fig 5A). The mbIFITM3 proteins showed a lower degree of S-palmitoylation compared with huIFITM3. Among the codon 70 mutants, the most marked difference was significantly reduced S-palmitoylation for mbIFITM3 P70W compared with wt mbIFITM3 (Fig 5A).",

            "text": "S-palmitoylation of IFITMs has only previously been studied for human and mouse proteins. To investigate S-palmitoylation in mbIFITM3, cysteine-to-alanine substitutions were made at conserved cysteine residues (C71, C72, and C105). A549 cells stably expressing single mutants C71A, C72A, and C105A, the double C71A-C72A mutant and the triple C71A-C72A-C105A mutant were generated. Two methods were used to assess S-palmitoylation: (i) the acyl exchange gel shift method described above (Figs 5, and 6A and B), and (ii) visualisation of palmitoylated proteins by in-gel fluorescence (Fig 6C and D). For this, the cells were metabolically labelled with a \u201cclickable\u201d alkyne palmitate analogue followed by further modification of the palmitoylated proteins via copper-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition reaction (i.e., \u201cclick chemistry\u201d) using a TAMRA-labelled capture reagent. The described metabolic labelling approach has been extensively used to successfully quantify a variety of PTMs (58, 59, 60). Comparing the two orthogonal methods (acyl exchange and metabolic labelling) used in this study reveals that both approaches have different informational value. The acyl exchange method only enables the quantification of the total amount of palmitoylated IFITM3. Because of the multi-valency of the streptavidin, multiple PTMs might still result in a 1:1 ratio of the IFITM3:streptavidin complex if the corresponding sites are in close vicinity. However, because of the significant shift of the IFITM3:streptavidin complex, palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated IFITM3 can be quantified in the same blot, thereby facilitating an internal normalization. The metabolic labelling approach enables the quantification of all palmitoylation sites, as each PTM contributes directly to the total TAMRA fluorescence intensity. However, for quantitative analysis, the TAMRA fluorescence must be normalized to the HA blot signal to account for variation in IFITM3-HA expression (Fig 6C) leading to larger error bars. The different informational value becomes obvious in the case of wt huIFITM3 and wt mbIFITM3. Although the TAMRA fluorescence for wt huIFITM3 was greater than for wt mbIFITM3 and huIFITM3 P70W (Fig 6C), the acyl exchange result did not show a significant difference in the proportion of palmitoylated protein in either case (Fig 6A). Hence, the total amount of palmitoylated IFITM3 is equivalent in all three cases; however, the number of palmitoylations per protein differs.",

All cysteine mutants showed impaired restriction relative to wt mbIFITM3, with a predominant pattern of greatest restriction by C71A > C105A > P70W > C72A (Fig 7A\u2013D). The double (C71A-C72A) and triple (C71A-C72A-C105A) mutants showed no restriction relative to control cells (Fig 7A\u2013D). This is consistent with S-palmitoylation being greatest for C71A and abrogated for the triple cysteine mutant (Fig 6), indicating that palmitoylation positively regulates the antiviral activity of mbIFITM3. For comparison, wt huIFITM3 and huIFITM3 P70W were also tested in lyssavirus entry assays.

The intracellular redistribution correlated with reduced exposure of IFITM3 at the cell surface (Fig 8A, intact). This was most marked for the double and triple cysteine mutants, which localized almost entirely to perinuclear sites and showed minimal cell surface staining above the background of untransduced cells. Of the mbIFITM3 point mutants, C72A had the most extensive perinuclear localization, correlating with it showing the greatest loss of restriction (Fig 7). The perinuclear expression of the P70W mutant was as prominent as that seen for C105A and C71A, but for all three, a proportion of cells expressed some IFITM3 at the cell surface and more widely within the cells (Fig 8). As seen for mbIFITM3 P70W, the perinuclear IFITM3 co-localized with the cis Golgi marker Giantin (Fig 8B) and with the trans Golgi network marker TGN46 (Fig S2A), and to a much lesser extent with CD63-positive endolysosomes distributed throughout the cells (Fig S2B).",

Comparative inter-species genomic analysis is a powerful tool to understand host\u2013pathogen interactions because genes and molecular determinants that function in host defense carry evolutionary signatures of adaptive evolution (63). Here, we included Chiroptera in evolutionary analyses of mammalian IR-IFITMs and identified strong adaptive evolution on the branch leading to bat IFITMs. Functional studies showed that codon 70, which exhibits extensive amino acid diversity among mammals, affects the antiviral activity and S-palmitoylation of mbIFITM3 and, furthermore, that S-palmitoylation is crucial for antiviral restriction by mbIFITM3 and has a marked effect on its subcellular localization.",

Importantly, the adaptive evolution we identified in bat IFITMs suggests that they serve an antiviral role in vivo, and that at least some bat viruses must have exerted major fitness costs on their hosts. Instances of virus-induced disease in bats have been reported (67, 68, 69), and the high viral richness per bat species (47) indicates that they harbor an exceptionally large number of viruses.

It has been suggested that basal activation of the Chiropteran IFN system (72) limits viral replication and enables disease tolerance (73), and our findings indicate that bat IFITMs serve an adaptive function and may contribute to this mechanism. Interestingly, the evidence to date indicates that different species\u2019 IFITMs restrict viruses that are naturally hosted by these species; for example, duck IFITM3 against IAV (40), nonhuman primate IFITMs against SIV (43), and bat IFITM3 against lyssaviruses (39). This suggests that evolution of viral antagonism of IFITMs, although demonstrated for HIV-1 in vitro (74), may not occur readily in nature, perhaps because IFITMs act so early in the viral replication cycle.",

None of these mutants differed from wt in restricting three different viruses IAV, SFV, and ZIKV.

A P70W substitution was made because tryptophan is common among the functional mammalian IFITMs in our phylogenetic analysis and was inferred as a possible ancestral codon (although the ancestral state reconstruction was ambiguous at the tree root). Microbat P70W showed reduced restriction of IAV, SFV, (Alphaviridae), ZIKV (Flaviviridae), and two lyssaviruses, concomitant with re-localization to perinuclear Golgi-associated sites and reduced S-palmitoylation. As for mbIFITM3 P70W, S-palmitoylation\u2013defective cysteine mutants of microbat IFITM3 showed markedly different localization from wt, with reduced expression at the cell surface and retention at Golgi-associated sites. Based on the evidence that restriction relies on the localization of IFITM proteins at sites of viral entry (13, 14, 20), altered localization of the mbIFITM3 P70W and cysteine mbIFITM3 mutants likely explains their reduced restriction of viruses that enter through endosomes. However, whether deficient S-palmitoylation leads to altered localization or whether altered localization prevents the proper enzymatic processes of microbat IFITM3 S-palmitoylation remains to be studied. The 23 different human ZDHHC palmitoyltransferases localize to various different cellular sites, including the early secretory pathway (ER and Golgi apparatus), plasma membrane, and endocytic vesicles (75). McMichael et al have suggested that the location at which IFITM3 is palmitoylated may influence its activity because they found that ZDHHC20, which had the greatest effect on IFITM3 S-palmitoylation, also uniquely co-localized with IFITM3 at lysosomes (29).",

In contrast, all cysteine mutants of mbIFITM3 relocalised to perinuclear Golgi-associated sites. Thus, S-palmitoylation may positively regulate the antiviral activity of human, murine, and microbat IFITM3 via different mechanisms, including effects on protein\u2013protein interactions, IFITM3 conformation, membrane tethering/targeting, or the interplay with other PTMs (26, 30). As for human and murine IFITM3 (30), our data indicate that C72 is the major site of S-palmitoylation in microbat IFITM3 with C72A showing the most profound defect in restriction. Single mutation of each of C71, C72, and C105 reproducibly impaired restriction by microbat IFITM3 in stable A549 cells, indicating that each of these S-palmitoylation sites contributes to antiviral function. In contrast, C105A but not C71A, reduced restriction by murine IFITM3 (30), and neither C105A nor C71A significantly impaired the antiviral activity of human IFITM3 (22, 30), including when human IFITM3 mutants were stably expressed in A549s (22), as in the current study.",

Alternatively, quantitative differences may be responsible: huIFITM3 P70W was twofold less S-palmitoylated in our metabolic labelling experiments than wt huIFITM3, but still more S-palmitoylated than wt mbIFITM3. More S-palmitoylations on human compared with mbIFITM3 might enable wt huIFITM3 to tolerate some reduced S-palmitoylation (e.g., with P70W), perhaps suggesting a threshold level of S-palmitoylated IFITM3 is needed for restriction.",

The S-palmitoylated C71 and C72 residues are highly conserved among IFITMs as well as the larger dispanin protein superfamily (3). The other residue flanking codon 70, N69, is also strongly evolutionarily conserved in IFITMs (Fig 2B) and thought to be specifically required for proper termination of the amphipathic helix (9). It is unlikely that the phenotype of our codon 70 mutant relates to disruption of the amphipathic helix comprising residues 59\u201368 because mutations in IFITM3 that destroy the amphipathic helix, including complete deletion of the helix, are S-palmitoylated at wild-type levels and localize normally (9). The residue at codon 70 might affect the accessibility of C71/C72 for acylation, or its cytoplasmic facing position could enable interactions with ZDHHCs, with themselves, transmembrane proteins with cytosolic DHHC-containing catalytic domains, or with protein complexes such as those needed for ZDHHC-mediated S-palmitoylation of Ras (76). However, the recognition and specificity determinants of ZDHHC protein substrates remains poorly understood (77) and not yet studied in the case of IFITMs. Interestingly, codon 70 lies within a short stretch of amino acid residues which is only present in the vertebrate DSPA proteins and no other dispanin superfamily member (3), consistent with a role mapping to the antiviral function that resides uniquely in some DSPA members.",

It may reflect the diversity in IFITM-modifying ZDHHCs among different species or differentially regulated S-palmitoylation of different IR-IFITMs in the same species to ensure successfully coordinated antiviral action in host cells. Alternatively, diversity at codon 70 may have evolved because of differences in the magnitude or the type of virus-induced selection acting on different hosts. Addressing these possibilities will require a range of different residues to be systematically tested in their cognate IR-IFITMs and host cell background against a range of viral targets, and for the pleotropic cellular effects of IFITM expression to be similarly analyzed (25). Our initial studies show that huIFITM3 or mbIFITM3 wt or codon 70 mutants do not affect proliferation of A549 cells (Fig S4). The literature on the viral and cellular roles of IFITMs has remained largely discrete, although it is important to consider how these roles co-exist and are regulated, particularly in light of the therapeutic potential of IFITMs as antivirals. The recent report that IFITM expression inhibits placental and fetal development by preventing trophoblast cell fusion highlights a novel, noninfectious, selective pressure that may oppose that of antiviral defense to shape IFITM evolution and regulation (78, 79). Such reproduction-based selection pressure likely varies between mammals according to species\u2019 fecundity, life history traits, and placental physiology and, interestingly, may be another driver of variation among mammalian IFITMs.",

For inclusion in phylogenetic analysis, genes identified via BLAST had to have a CD225 domain, intact ORF of \u223cIFITM size, and two exons. IFITM genes were cloned from primary fibroblasts from the microbat species M. myotis, the FLN-R cell line derived from microbat E. serotinus (kindly provided by Prof Martin Beer, Friedrich Loeffler Institute), and the pig NPTr cell line, using RACE and RT-PCR methods as previously described (39). The P. alecto IFITM3 gene sequence used was found using proteomics informed by transcriptomics (53), which provided evidence for transcript and protein expression in P. alecto cells. Uncharacterized IFITM sequences were named as \u201cIFITM3-like\u201d if their initiation codons aligned with known IFITM3 genes and \u201cIFITM1-like\u201d if their start codon aligned with other IFITM1 genes.

Cell lysates were reduced with Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and free Cys residues were capped with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), preventing them from further reaction. Thioester bonds were subsequently cleaved with hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to remove S-acyl groups before liberated cysteines were alkylated with biotin-maleimide (Biotin-Mal). Thus, S-palmitoylated proteins were selectively biotinylated and subsequently selectively bound by streptavidin. After streptavidin treatment, proteins were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and analyzed by Western blot, enabling the detection of both unmodified and S-palmitoylated proteins. (B) Streptavidin titration. Lysates from A549 cells expressing either wt huIFITM3 or huIFITM3 P70A (the highest expressed mutant) were subject to acyl\u2013biotin exchange, streptavidin (\u201cStrep\u201d) treatment, SDS\u2013PAGE, and Western blotting as previously described.
