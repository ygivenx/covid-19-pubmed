Based on these trends, several studies have been conducted on the acquisition and processing of information, aiming at a higher-level understanding of the collected information. In particular, detection of the user\u2019s context, such as their emotional or physical state, is of particular importance because it enables the creation of context-aware systems that adapt their behavior to match the context in which they are used. This branch of computer science is known as context-aware computing. A sub-branch of it, which is the focus of this study, concentrates on classifying emotions using physiological data.",

            "text": "The study of emotion classification belongs to the area of affective computing (AC) that aims to build computer systems capable of detecting and reacting to the user\u2019s emotions. The area of AC in computer science is considered to have been established when a seminal paper by Picard [1] was published, and it has since become a vibrant field of study, with some example studies being [2,3,4]. To classify emotions in these systems, researchers have three data collection (i.e., measurement) strategies at their disposal [5]: (i) neurological/physiological measurement, which uses sensors to detect changes in the user\u2019s body; (ii) subjective self-reporting by questionnaires, diaries or interviews; and (iii) behavioral measurement that is based on expert observations of the participant\u2019s behavior. While all these approaches have their specific advantages and disadvantages, as Kim and Fesenmaier [5] suggest, physiological measurement is considered to be particularly objective. In our literature review, we found that a large body of AC studies exists on classifying emotions from physiological data such as electroencephalography (EEG) [2,6,7], galvanic skin response (GSR) [2,8,9,10,11], heart rate [2,10,11], and others [12,13]. However, a higher validity can be achieved by combining more than one measurement strategy. For example, a viable approach, which is employed in this study, is to combine a physiological approach with self-reporting, where the latter is used to verify the existence of the target emotion.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used both EEG and GSR data for boredom classification. In this study, we performed a joint analysis of both data by collecting EEG and GSR data from 28 participants who also answered a questionnaire surveying their perceived level of boredom. The participants watched two types of video stimuli that were prepared to elicit boredom and to entertain, respectively. Based on the collected data and questionnaire results, we ran an initial test of 19 machine learning algorithms and selected the best three candidate classification models. After hyperparameter tuning, we measured the final performance of the selected models with 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation. The best performance with a mean accuracy of 79.98% (min: 71.43%, max: 93.93%) was obtained using a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Furthermore, we analyzed the used features to investigate the correlation between EEG data, GSR data, and boredom. This study, therefore, has three major contributions: (i) revealing a correlation between EEG, GSR, and boredom; (ii) conducting a reliable performance comparison among 19 machine learning algorithms through repeated cross validations; and (iii) proposing a robust boredom classification model based on MLP.",

Vogel-Walcutt et al.\u2019s literature review resulted in 37 definitions of boredom, and concluded that \u201cboredom occurs when an individual experiences both the neurological state of low arousal and the psychological state of dissatisfaction, frustration, or disinterest in response to the low arousal.\u201d [27]. The conclusions of Russell\u2019s model [26] and Vogel-Walcutt et al.\u2019s definition [27] are thus similar. In contrast, the range of boredom in Eastwood et al.\u2019s definition [28] is wider than that of Russell\u2019s model. According to their study, people who are in a low-valence state can feel boredom regardless of the level of arousal. Considering these studies, we conclude that a universally accepted definition of boredom does not exist.",

In the physiological perspective, EEG data are captured from the activity of the brain, which belongs to the nervous system together with GSR. Moreover, the analysis on the characteristics of boredom conducted by Bench and Lench [34] suggested that boredom should be associated with the increased autonomic nervous system activity. This linkage implies that a correlation may exist between boredom, EEG and GSR, but so far it has not been investigated in previous studies.",

However, these studies did not address the issue of overfitting carefully, making it difficult to guarantee the robustness of the results. Moreover, many previous studies lacked the discussion on the choice of the classification algorithms and only considered a few limited algorithms.

The EEG sensor captured raw EEG at a 220 Hz sampling rate and provided power spectral density (PSD) values for each electrode. According to the sensor manufacturer, the types of PSD data were absolute band power (ABP), relative band power, and others [36]. The sampling rate of these data was 10 Hz. To calculate ABP, we applied the fast Fourier transform algorithm. We calculated PSD by the following EEG frequency bands [36]:Delta: (1\u20134) Hz,Theta: (4\u20138) Hz,Alpha: (7.5\u201313) Hz,Beta: (13\u201330) Hz,Gamma: (30\u201344) Hz.",

An important property of a good classification model is the robustness of performance over multiple executions. To evaluate this for the selected models, we executed 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation with different random seeds. Thus, training data and testing data splits were changed randomly.

One of the reasons contributing to this difference is that, as we explained in the paragraph above as well as in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2.1, the experimental setting and the way we evaluated the models\u2019 performance was modified from the previous study. These changes were made to improve the robustness and generalizability of the results. For example, in our previous study [7], we acquired multiple samples from one participant\u2019s data by splitting them into one-second windows and used these for training; in the current study, we acquired only one sample from each participants\u2019 dataset by increasing the window size, thus aiming to increase the independence between the samples. This can help to reduce overfitting and achieve more generalizable results. Moreover, the previous study conducted only one iteration of cross validation, whereas, in the current study, mean accuracies were recorded after 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation to increase the robustness of the results. This approach provides more reliable performance scores especially in the applications where the number of available samples is relatively small as in this study. Although the aforementioned steps taken decreased the accuracy of the final model, the generalizability and reliability of the result were increased.",

In our feature refinement results, the WSE algorithm recommended the EEG and GSR features on the best performing model for increasing performance. This suggests that the combination of these data correlates with boredom. In particular, Gamma band features were selected for the combined EEG-GSR and the EEG datasets. This indicates that the Gamma band may correlate with boredom, whereas the Alpha, Beta and Delta bands have weaker correlations, and the Theta band has no correlation at all with boredom. Furthermore, the WSE algorithm selected the standard deviation of MV among the GSR features from the combined EEG-GSR and GSR datasets.

We collected the data from Korean participants using non-boredom stimuli that were purposefully picked for this cultural context; therefore, the model may not be applicable to participants coming from other cultures. Regarding the protocol, we did not consider the effect of the order of showing the stimuli because the number of participants was deemed to be insufficient for dividing them into comparison groups. Finally, we used only one type of content to elicit boredom. Other types of contents may give different results about the intensity of the experienced emotion. In our future work, we aim to solve these limitations by collecting more data from a diverse group of users who are exposed to different boredom-evoking stimuli.",

As noted above, the current results still have limited applicability due to the experiment design that used only one type of boredom stimulus and a fairly homogeneous participant population. We plan to use diverse stimuli and extend the data collection to children, elderly people, patients suffering from different medical conditions, and participants representing other cultures to overcome these limitations.",
