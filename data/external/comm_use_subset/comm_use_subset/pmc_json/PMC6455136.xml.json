ZIKV was first isolated from a febrile sentinel rhesus macaque in 1947 and from an Aedes africanus mosquito in 1948 in Zika Forest, Uganda [2]. ZIKV infection has been associated with mild symptoms such as fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. Sporadic cases of ZIKV infections were reported over the next half century before ZIKV emerged in major outbreaks in Yap Island in 2007 [3], French Polynesia in 2013 [4], and Brazil in 2015 [5]. These ZIKV outbreaks have been associated with Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and congenital microcephaly [6, 7].",

These include C-type lectin DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, and phosphatidylserine receptors such as members of the T-cell Ig mucin (TIM) family and the TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK (TAM) family [8]. The TAM receptor AXL, through soluble intermediates growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) was recently shown to support ZIKV infection of human foreskin fibroblast [9], glial cells [10], neural stem cells [11,12], and foetal endothelial cells [13]. However, recent findings also suggest that AXL is not required in ZIKV infection in mouse models [14\u201316], neural progenitor cells, and cerebral organoids [17]. These contrasting findings suggested that AXL is not involved in ZIKV entry. Overall, the mechanism underlying ZIKV and/or other flaviviruses entry into host cells remains unclear.",

Multiple flaviviruses, including DENV [18], WNV [19], and JEV [20], are known to use cell surface heparan sulfate as an attachment receptor. However, our previous findings suggested that heparan sulfate has no role in ZIKV infection [21]. Sialic acids are typically found on terminating branches of N-glycans, O-glycans and glycosphingolipids (gangliosides). Sialic acid may mediate virus binding and infection of cells, or alternatively can act as decoy receptors that bind virions and block virus infection [22]. Sialic acid is known to be an attachment or entry receptor for multiple viruses of significant public health concern, including human and avian influenza viruses [23,24], paramyxoviruses [25], picornaviruses [26\u201330], and coronaviruses [31,32]. Many sialic acid-terminated glycan binding viruses have evolved to select for specific interactions with particular sialic acid forms and linkages on different hosts and tissues, which often play important roles in the tropism of the virus [22,33].",

Specifically, ZIKV, MR766 was reported to efficiently infect hNPCs derived from induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) [36]. Therefore, we next sought to examine whether sialic acid is also involved in ZIKV infection in human iPSC-derived NPCs. Human induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), reprogrammed from human dermal fibroblasts were used for neural progenitor cell induction. As shown in Figure 3(a), neural progenitor cells treated with 1 U/ml of C. perfringens neuraminidase displayed less sialic acid on the cell surface. When treated at the final concentration of 1U/ml, there was a significant decrease in ZIKV infection for multiple strains as determined by real-time PCR (Figure 3(b)). Plaque assays (Figure 3(c)) showed decreasing viral titres of 2.6 log PFU/ml, 1.4 log PFU/ml and 1.7 log PFU/ml for ZIKV MR766, Paraiba and 16-922, respectively. As shown in Figure 3(c), ZIKV MR766 replicates more efficiently in neural progenitor cells as compared to other ZIKV strains. As an additional control, we demonstrate that neural progenitor cells are permissive to H1N1 A/NWS/33 and PRV3M infection. Neuraminidase treatment significantly inhibits A/NWS/33 but failed to reduce PRV3M infection (Figure 3(d)).\n",

These modifications may have an impact on virus infection. To further corroborate our findings, we specifically generated \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid-deficient Huh7 cells by knocking out ST \u03b2-galactoside-\u03b12,3-sialyltransferase (ST3GAL4) gene using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.

For virus internalization, ZIKV-infected cells were subjected to pronase treatment to remove plasma membrane-bound but un-internalized viral particles after incubation at 37\u00b0C (Figure 6(a,b,c)). This experiment was performed in order to differentiate the role of sialic acid in attachment versus internalization. As shown in Figure 6(d), there was no difference in ZIKV particles that attached to the neuraminidase-treated and untreated cells at 4\u00b0C. As a control, it was evident that neuraminidase-treated cells significantly reduced influenza H1N1 A/NWS/33 attachment (Figure 6(d)). By using pronase to remove un-internalized virus particles, we observed a significant reduction (3-fold) of the viral RNA in the neuraminidase-treated Vero cells (Figure 6(e)).

Consistent with neuraminidase-treated Vero cells, Vero\u0394GNE cells also internalized significantly less ZIKV virus particles (Figure 6(f)). However, it is interesting to note that GNE knockout also had some effect on ZIKV attachment. It is known that GNE knockout not only stop sialic acid production, it also affects the synthesis of other carbohydrates [37]. Using the Huh7\u0394ST3GAL4, we further demonstrated that remove of \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid alone had no effect on ZIKV attachment (Fig. S2). As a control, influenza H1N1 A/NWS/33 internalization was shown to be significantly reduced in Vero\u0394GNE (Figure 6(g)). Pronase treatment on Vero\u0394GNE cells has no impact on PRV3M internalization (Figure 6(g)). To characterize the sialic acid-binding activity of ZIKV, ZIKV was pre-incubated with 3\u2032 sialyllactose and 6\u2032 sialyllactose prior to infection of Vero cells. None of these treatments showed significant inhibition of ZIKV MR766 infection of Vero cells, while inhibition of H1N1 A/NWS/33 was observed, as expected (Fig. S3). As a control, \u03b1-mannose binding lectin, conA inhibits both ZIKV MR766 and H1N1 A/NWS/33 infection (Fig. S3). Taken together, these data suggest that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, further supporting our previous finding that sialic acid is not involved in ZIKV attachment.",

Sialic acids are a highly diverse family of monosaccharides that serve as terminal residues of N- and O-linked glycoproteins, glycolipids and are also components of various polysaccharides. Sialic acids are abundantly displayed on the surfaces of vertebrate cells, particularly on all mucosal surfaces. However, the role of sialic acid in flavivirus infection, in particular, ZIKV, is unknown. Multiple studies have reported that neuraminidase treatment of Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells failed to inhibit DENV-1, DENV-4, and WNV infection [38-40]. This could be due to the fact that insect cells are deficient in sialic acid biosynthesis enzymes and thus lack cell surface sialic acids [41\u201343].",

Cell surface \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid facilitates infection of ZIKV strains from both the African (Uganda) and Asia (French Polynesia, Brazil, and Singapore isolates) lineages. By using pronase to remove plasma membrane-bound but un-internalized virus particles [44], our data demonstrated that sialic acid is involved in ZIKV internalization, not attachment. This finding could explain why neuraminidase-treated HepG2 and Vero cells failed to reduce S35-labelled DENV-1 binding in a previous study [45]. Similarly, sialic acid is previously reported to enhance adeno-associated virus 2.5 T internalization through sialic acid-dependent endocytosis [46]. The failure of blocking ZIKV infection by pre-incubation of ZIKV with 3\u2032 or 6\u2032 sialyllactose and fetuin further suggests that there was no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV virus particles during virus attachment. The mechanism underlying sialic acid-dependent internalization remains unclear. Sialic acids are not able to transmit signals across the plasma membrane and therefore, require additional signalling receptors to trigger internalization or endocytosis [47]. The binding of influenza A virus to sialic acid on the cells results in clustering of lipid rafts and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases, which subsequently recruit PI3K to trigger the endocytosis pathway [47].",

Sialin, mainly found in lysosomes, is an anion transporter capable of transporting glucuronic acid and free sialic acid out of the lysosome after it is cleaved from sialoglycoconjugates [48]. When the exogenous source of sialic acid was depleted by using FBS-free medium, the Vero\u0394GNE cells were significantly less susceptible to ZIKV infection. In contrast, no significant susceptibility change was observed for the wild-type Vero cells cultured in 2% FBS versus serum-free medium. This implied that Vero\u0394GNE cells were still able to display a low level of sialic acid on the surface when grown in the FBS-containing medium. This further highlights the important role of sialic acid in ZIKV infection. Transient expression of GNE gene is able to restore ZIKV infectivity in Vero\u0394GNE.",

Furthermore, ZIKV replicates efficiently in neural progenitor cells, leading to a cell-cycle arrest, defects in differentiation and resulting microcephaly in a mouse model [34]. However, genetic ablation of AXL has no effect on ZIKV entry or ZIKV-mediated cell death in human iPSC-neural progenitor cells or cerebral organoids [17]. A recent study further suggests that AXL promotes ZIKV infection in astrocytes by antagonizing type I interferon signalling, rather than promoting ZIKV entry [50]. Here, we demonstrate that sialic acid is required for ZIKV infection in neural progenitor cells.",
