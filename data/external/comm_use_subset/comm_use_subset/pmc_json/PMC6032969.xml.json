SCI is the highest cause of death in young people (15\u201329 years of age) [1]. There are currently no treatments which have a proven positive effect on neurological outcome [2, 3], following acute SCI. Spinal cord injury results in primary initial damage and subsequent secondary damage [4]. The secondary damage due to early inflammatory responses after spinal cord injury is the main cause for neurological defects and exacerbates the initial degree of injury [5] and the secondary damage usually caused by ischemia, cellular and tissue edema, and oxidative damage [6].",

PPAR-\u03b3 is a PPAR nuclear receptor subtype. There are two types of PPAR-\u03b3 ligands: natural ligands such as fatty acids and eicosanoid derivatives [8] and synthetic ligands such as thiazolidinediones ketones (thiazolidinedione, TZD), of which rosiglitazone (rosiglitazone) and pioglitazone (pioglitazone) are used in clinical medicine as a treatment for type 2 diabetes [9]. Rosiglitazone is part of the thiazolidinediones nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and is known for its anti-inflammatory actions via the activation of PPAR-\u03b3. Rosiglitazone attenuates the expression of proinflammatory genes and cytokine production by regulating ligand activation of transcription factors [10, 11]. And rosiglitazone has neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases and spinal cord injury [12, 13]. We previously reported that application of the PPAR-\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone could significantly inhibit activation of the key inflammatory cascade target nuclear transcription factor kappa B (nuclear factor kappa B; NF-\u03baB) after spinal cord injury [7].",

The NF-\u03baB and PPAR-\u03b3 signaling pathways are closely related; PPAR-\u03b3 activation along with inhibition of the NF-\u03baB-cytokine cascade could protect against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice [16]. PPAR-\u03b3 could also attenuate inflammation via NF-\u03baB inhibition in lipopolysaccharide-induced peritonitis [17]. In addition to functions in glucose and lipid metabolism and cell proliferation and differentiation, PPAR-\u03b3 can also alleviate the acute and chronic inflammatory response after nerve injury and ameliorate neuronal apoptosis and ischemic brain injury by suppressing NF-\u03baB-driven p22phox transcription [18].",

[19] reported distinct loss of hippocampal dentate gyrus neuronal tissue in NF-\u03baB gene-deficient mice; reactivation of NF-\u03baB could promote the formation of dentate gyrus neurons and neural network and improve neuronal organization and animal behavior. The underlying mechanism is likely related to the activation of cAMP/PKA after activation of NF-\u03baB. cAMP (Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate) was discovered in 1958 by Earl [20]; increased levels of cAMP lead to a transient enhancement of transmitter release [21] and regulation of cAMP and cGMP together ensures coordinated development of one axon and multiple dendrites. PKA could enhance transmitter release at the synaptic connection between the sensory and motor neuron [22]. PKA is implicated in the growth of axons and survival of newborn neurons [19, 23]. Forskolin is a unique diterpene activator of cyclic AMP-generating systems [24]. Forskolin-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase stimulates nerve regeneration in vivo [25]. Sulaiman et al. [26] found that treatment with forskolin alone and in combination with TGF-\u03b2 resulted in an increase in the number of regenerated axons compared with saline-only control.",

In in vitro experiments, we intend to verify that PPAR-\u03b3 activation inhibits NF-\u03baB expression, which in turn could inhibit the cAMP/PKA pathway. After confirming the inhibition of cAMP/PKA by PPAR-\u03b3, animal experiments will be initiated to determine whether simultaneous activation of PPAR-\u03b3 and PKA could inhibit inflammation and promote neuronal formation. In this study, we explored the role of PPAR-\u03b3 and PKA in functional recovery after spinal cord injury in SD rats. We aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying this recovery, as well as the balance between the inflammatory cascade and generation of endogenous spinal cord neurons.",

Three sets of eye scissors and tweezers were prepared in sequence and placed in beakers with 75% alcohol, numbered 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The skin was cut using the first scissors, and both sides of the spine were cut from the rib fossa, from the bottom up, to remove the modified fascia and fat tissue attached to the spine by using the second scissors. With 1 mL of serum-free DMEM/F12 medium drawn with a 1 mL syringe, syringe needle was flushed from one end of the spine and washed 3 times repeatedly to flush out the spinal cord.

            "text": "The interaction of PPAR-\u03b3 and NF-\u03baB has been implicated in certain central neural diseases [32]. PPAR-\u03b3 can inhibit the activity of NF-\u03baB by binding to the subunits P65 and P50 of NF-\u03baB and competing for common transcription coactivators such as SRC-1 and p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein) or upregulate inhibitor kappa B (I\u03baB) protein, which prevents NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation which is a prerequisite for NF-\u03baB activation. PPAR-\u03b3 could also indirectly inhibit NF-\u03baB by activating transcription factor Nrf2, which reduces generation of prooxidative molecules that are required for NF-\u03baB activation. PPAR-\u03b3 therefore mediates the inhibition of NF-\u03baB, thereby reducing the central nervous system inflammatory cascade and effecting neuroprotection [33]. Under conditions of induced differentiation, we found that after PPAR-\u03b3 activation, the expression of NF-\u03baB is inhibited. PKA expression was also inhibited in this process and was restored when PPAR-\u03b3 was inhibited. This is likely related to PPAR\u03b3-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB, since PKA is found downstream of NF-\u03baB; however, the feedback mechanism was not clear. LKB1, a substrate of PKA, plays an important role in axogenesis [34]. Koichiro et al. [35] suggested that the activation of PPAR-\u03b3 by rosiglitazone stimulated NSC growth and inhibited the differentiation of NSCs into neurons. We found that PPAR-\u03b3 activation in a neural stem cell differentiation induction system inhibits the MAP2 expression, which is consistent with the results of Koichiro. These results confirmed that the inhibitory effect of PPAR-\u03b3 on neuronal differentiation of spinal cord-derived neural stem cells could occur via NF-\u03baB and PKA in vitro. In order to show the inhibition of the cAMP pathway by rosiglitazone, cAMP levels in cells were measured by ELISA. And we see that changes in CAMP levels are consistent with changes in PKA levels.",

And we found a corresponding increase in the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 and PKA after applying rosiglitazone and forskolin, respectively. We used NeuN as an in vivo marker of mature neuronal survival following SCI. NeuN is an antigen used widely in research and diagnostics to identify postmitotic neurons. In the present study, we observed that the NeuN expression in the forskolin group was lower than that in the rosiglitazone and forskolin + rosiglitazone groups. This suggests that rosiglitazone inhibits inflammation and, combined with forskolin, promotes neuronal formation and has the best protective effect on mature neural stem cell survival. Forskolin alone had no effect on the survival of mature neurons in the inflammatory cascade following spinal cord injury.",

MAP-2 is extremely sensitive to many factors, and recent investigations have revealed dynamic functions for MAP2 in the growth, differentiation, and plasticity of neurons. These discoveries indicate that modification and rearrangement of MAP2 are an early obligatory step in many processes that modify neuronal function [36]. In the present experiment study, we observed that the expression of MAP2 in the forskolin group was higher than that in the rosiglitazone and forskolin + rosiglitazone groups, which is likely related to the activation of PKA. PKA is implicated in the growth of axons and survival of newborn neurons [20, 21]. Thus, forskolin likely plays an important role in promoting neuron formation, while rosiglitazone negatively regulates neuron formation. We also examined the expression of cAMP in vitro and PKA in vivo, which was consistent with the expression of MAP2, suggesting that forskolin affects neuron formation through cAMP/PKA.",

Neuroprotection by genistein against oxidative stress injury in cortical neurons occurs via inhibition of NF-\u03baB, JNK, and ERK signaling pathway [37]. In the adult mammalian brain, NF-\u03baB activity seems to be crucial in regulating structural plasticity and replenishment of granule cells within the hippocampus throughout life. We suggest that inhibiting the expression of NF-\u03baB is a key strategy to inhibit the secondary inflammatory cascade and promote the locomotor recovery in SD rats after spinal cord injury. Further, the activation of PPAR-\u03b3 inhibits NF-\u03baB expression in a SD rat spinal cord injury model.",

Reactivation of NF-\u03baB resulted in integration of newborn neurons and eventual regeneration of the dentate gyrus, accompanied by a complete recovery of structural and behavioral defects. These effects were attributed to NF-\u03baB-mediated control of PKA transcription, and regulation of axogenesis [19, 23]. Sulaiman et al. [38] found that forskolin could attenuate the adverse effects of long-term Schwann cell denervation on peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. Further, forskolin had protective effects on behavioral deficits and neuropathological changes in a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis [39] and could contribute to more efficient production of DAergic neurons from human-derived NPCs for therapy of neurodegenerative diseases [40]. In the present study, we found that forskolin could improve the number of nerve dendrites (MAP2 marker) in a SD rat spinal cord injury model, which was consistent with the aforementioned findings. During this process, we observed that forskolin increased the expression of PKA, which also confirmed that the effect of forskolin on neuronal formation is being through PKA.",
