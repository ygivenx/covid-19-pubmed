IBV has a linear, single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity of approximately 27 kb in length and produces enveloped virions. IBV particles consist of three major structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The spike of IBV is formed by post-translational cleavage of S into two separate polypeptide components, S1 and S2 [5, 6]. S1 mediates virion attachment to IBV host cells and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies in chickens. Genotype evolution of IBV is associated primarily with changes in the S1amino-acidsequence [7, 8]. Hence, the evolutionary characterization of IBV is mainly based on the analysis of the variable S1 gene or the expressed S1 protein [9, 10].",

Six isolates were obtained, of which isolates designated D, E, F, H, and M were found to be serologically related to the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype, whereas the sixth isolate, G, differed from the Mass serotype and other serotypes known at the time. Importantly, El-Houadfi et al. demonstrated that Mass-based IBV vaccines provided poor protection against infection with isolate G [15]. In 2004, Alarabi conducted a study to determine the relationship between IBV and nephropathogenic disease outbreaks observed in broiler flocks in Morocco between 1996 and 2000. Three different groups of IBV isolates were identified using RT-PCR coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Group I belonged to the Mass serotype, whereas groups II and III were distinct. Isolate 12/97 of group III, found to be closely related to isolate G, caused more severe kidney lesions and higher lethality in experimentally infected animals compared to isolate 7/97 of group II [16]. In 2005, El Bouqdaoui et al., while studying nephropathogenic IBV using RT-PCR and RFLP techniques, identified five genotypes, three of which differed from vaccine strains [17].",

The official data regarding the general poultry rearing systems in Morocco are: broiler production, 450 million/year (among 6,800 farms); layers: 20 million/year (250 farms); turkeys: 12 million/year (25 % imported d-old chicks); broiler breeders: 3.2 million/year (70 % imported from Spain and 30 % from other European countries); 48 hatcheries. The Interprofessional Federation of Poultry Sector (FISA) aims to develop exports of poultry products in particular to Northern and Western Africa. FISA is affiliated with Association of Moroccan Exporters (ASMEX) under the objective of promoting poultry product export in Africa, including chicks, hatching eggs, and compound feed for poultry. In 2012, 6.7 million hatching eggs and 1.9-million\u2013d-old chicks were exported to Mauritania, Mali, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Senegal, and 25,000 tons of compound feed were exported to Mauritania. Breeder chicks (182,000) were imported in January 2014 (an increase of 28 % compared to 2013). However, imports of layer and broiler breeder and turkey poults declined in recent years, mainly due the development of local production.",

New IBV serotypes and genotypes can emerge as a result of only very few changes in the amino acid sequence of the S protein. Vaccination programs largely rely on the use of the IBV Massachusetts strain, which is also the most commonly used IBV vaccine strain in Morocco. However, despite the use of this vaccine, the common presences of IB in vaccinated chickens continue to have a major negative economic impact [18]. In this study, IB was diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2013 in southern and central regions of Morocco. Suspected IBV infections were found in 47 commercial broiler chicken farms. Among these, three flocks showed severe clinical signs and mortality. The aim of the present study is to characterize a new emerging genotype of IBV from these outbreaks using molecular techniques, and to determine the relationship to reference IBV strains by nucleotide sequence analysis.",

One-step RT-PCR was performed with 12.5 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer mix, 0.5 \u03bclof MgSO4 (50 mmol/l), 0.5 \u03bcl of Rox reference dye (25 mmol/l, Life Technologies), 0.5 \u03bcl of Moloneymurine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 U/\u03bcl), 0.5 \u03bclof Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies), 0.5 \u03bcl of primers (0.2 \u03bcmol/l), 0.25 \u03bcl of probe (0.1 \u03bcmol/l), and 5 \u03bcl of RNA template to make a final volume of 25 \u03bcl.The reaction was carried out using a StepOne Plus real-time PCR system (Smart Cycler, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) at 50 \u00b0C for 15 min, 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, and followed by 40 cycles of 9 \u00b0C for 15 s; 60 \u00b0C for 45 s; 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 74 \u00b0C for 5 min. Amplifications were recorded and analyzed, and the threshold cycle (Ct) was determined with StepOne software (Smart Cycler).",
