ASF is caused by a large, complex double-stranded DNA virus, the African swine fever virus (ASFV) (Galindo and Alonso, 2017). The disease shares similar clinical signs with classical swine fever (CSF) and several other swine diseases (Oura et al., 2013), making its diagnosis difficult, especially outside of a diagnostics laboratory By 5 September 2019, 156 outbreaks were detected in China and 1,170,000 pigs were culled in an effort to halt further spread (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 2019). There is no effective treatment or vaccine against ASF yet, so controlling ASF mainly relies on animal slaughter and sanitary measures (Galindo and Alonso, 2017; Dixon et al., 2019). Therefore, accurate and timely diagnosis of ASF infections is crucial for controlling epidemics.",

            "text": "The recommended gold standard for diagnosis according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is virus isolation. But this is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and virus isolation is not a method applicable to disease monitoring and control (Oura et al., 2013). The antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a rapid and convenient method for detecting ASFV antigens (Oura et al., 2013). However, it lacks sensitivity in subacute cases or for early-stage infections and has poor specificity because it cannot correctly identify different viral strains (Oura et al., 2013; Boonham et al., 2014). Hence, the molecular tools for detecting ASFV, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR, have become popular because of their sensitivity and specificity for ASF diagnosis (Oura et al., 2013). Nevertheless, such methods are not suitable for on-site situations (e.g., on farms) or for rapid viral detection as they require thermal cycling instruments and skilled operators (Ikeno et al., 2013; Boonham et al., 2014; Khodakov et al., 2016). Isothermal amplification techniques, such as recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loop mediated isothermal amplification and cross-priming amplification, have been successfully used to detect ASFV (Oura et al., 2013). Recently, many novel isothermal amplification assays in combination with immunochromatographic strips have also been developed for on-site detection of ASFV (Gao et al., 2018; Miao et al., 2019). With no need for instruments and skilled operators, isothermal amplification has become a promising on-site detection method. But like other amplification technologies, its resolution depends on the binding specificity between the primers and templates, which can limit their accuracy (Boonham et al., 2014; He et al., 2019).",

The trans-cleavage activity of the recently reported Cas12a, Cas13a, and Cas14 systems in particular, helps them first bind to the target specifically and then amplify the binding signal by cutting the dual-labeled probe in a nonspecific way (Gootenberg et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Harrington et al., 2018; Qian et al., 2019). New nucleic acid detection technologies for different purposes using the CRISPR/Cas12a and Cas13a systems, such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK and HOLMES etc., have extremely high sensitivities and specificities (single base resolution), and have been developed in combination with other gene amplification methods, including PCR and RPA (Gootenberg et al., 2017, 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Myhrvold et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2018; Shan et al., 2019). Cas12-based DETECTR and HOLMES need fluorescent detection equipment and therefore are not suitable for field-based tests (Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Santos et al., 2018). In contrast, when Cas13-based SHERLOCK is combined with an immunochromatographic strip, it becomes a good choice for on-site detection (Gootenberg et al., 2018; Myhrvold et al., 2018). However, Cas13-based system like SHERLOCK, both the target and probe are RNA, which increases the detection costs and reduces the assay\u2019s stability. Moreover, the RNA probe can generate false positive results because RNase is ever present and RNA is generally unstable (Gootenberg et al., 2017, 2018; Myhrvold et al., 2018; Sashital, 2018; Shan et al., 2019). The newly reported naked-eye gene detection platform based on the CRISPR/Cas12a/13a system also needs a centrifugal machine and whole blood samples can interrupt the naked-eye detection (Yuan et al., 2019).",

In this study, we combined Cas12a with recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and an immunochromatographic lateral flow strip to develop a test strip method, termed CORDS (Cas12a-based On-site and Rapid Detection System) for ASFV on-site detection. CORDS can detect the ASFV target at a sensitivity of 1 fM within 1 h of initiation and without cross reaction to 13 porcine virus DNAs. When the RAA-Cas12a-based system was combined with fluorescence, the sensitivity increased to 10 aM. Finally, CORDS can also be freeze-dried in three tubes, making it suitable for transportation and storage, factors that are helpful in resource limited on-site situations. The lyophilized CORDS products are highly stable. Successful detection of ASFV with sensitivity comparable to that of SHERLOCK and without the need for expensive instruments makes our method a robust on-site detection platform.",

According to our accelerated stability tests, the RAA buffer mix still maintained femtomolar sensitivity after storage at 37\u00b0C for 1 week. The lyophilized Cas mix should work well after storage at 4\u00b0C for 1 week without any sensitivity decrease. Therefore, these stability tests show that CORDS can be stored and transported under the conditions provided by the diagnostic kit\u2019s manufacturers. It is envisaged that lyophilized CORDS has potential for industrial manufacturing and widespread on-site application. According to the accelerated stability tests, the lyophilized Cas mix is not as stable as the lyophilized RAA buffer mix and manufacturer provided RAA mix. Considering Cas12a is a rather stable protein, the cause might be instability of the crRNA. RNA modification or capping may help to solve this problem and enable transportation at room temperature to lower the assay costs.",
