The presence of bacteria in the lower airways was interpreted as a pathological phenomenon, based on cultural microbiological information [5]. It was explained as transient migration by microaspiration, reflecting the composition of the upper respiratory tract, although the biomass would be lower. It was further conceded that the lower respiratory tract microbiome could be related to contamination of the upper tract during sampling [6]. According to Dickson and Huffnagle, the notion that the lungs are sterile is still frequently stated in textbooks, virtually always without citation [7]. Respiratory culture-based protocols sought only to identify clinically significant pathogens [8].",

In addition, viruses like herpesvirus simplex, cytomegalovirus or torque teno virus can be present in the distal airway mucosa [13, 20\u201322], and therefore may have been missed with our PCR strategy. However, despite this limitation, the main respiratory viruses were properly searched, and this is the group of major concern, when dealing with respiratory infections. Another important advantage of this study was the focus on a population undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, allowing the collection of samples from the distal airways, although blindly, which is usually a limitation in this type of studies.",
