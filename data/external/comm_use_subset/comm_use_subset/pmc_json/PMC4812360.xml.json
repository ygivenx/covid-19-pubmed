While this chapter includes codes such as U04 for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), most of the codes in this chapter were developed to incorporate patterns or disorders diagnosed through Korean medicine (U20\u2013U99). In Korea, doctors of Korean medicine are advised to use KCD 6, which is based on Western medicine, as their primary code system; however, when the doctor cannot correlate the diagnosis specifically to KCD 6, the doctors are to supplement the diagnosis with a U code [5]. While KCDOM2 (1994), which was based on Korean medicine, was used by doctors of Korean medicine instead of KCD 5, the overlap and mismatch of some diseases between KCD and KCDOM caused serious confusion. Therefore, U codes were developed to support the patterns and symptoms diagnosed only through Korean medicine while incorporating many of the disease codes from KCDOM2 that showed similar characteristics to KCD 6 codes. For example, terminology in Korean medicine that refers to cancer was absorbed into KCD 6 because the symptoms of the two different codes were almost identical; however, terminology in Korean medicine referring to patterns of disorders, such as qi deficiency pattern/syndrome, remained under U codes [3]. Therefore, through the third revision, KCDOM eliminated the overlapping disease classifications between the previous KCDOM and KCD5 and reorganized the remaining disorders and patterns into U codes, which reduced possible duplicate coding and allowed pattern identification and diagnosis through Korean medicine. The incorporation of KCDOM3 into KCD 6 was also conducted to meet the needs of doctors of Korean medicine to more effectively reflect the patient's condition. As a result, one of the major characteristics of KCDOM3 is its relationship with KCD 6 [5].",

            "text": "One approach towards better health care is quantification of the burden of disease [6]. Burden of disease is a crucial input into health policy, because it provides an account of health loss due to different risks through a disease-by-disease analysis [7]. Most health analyses concentrate on mortality, thereby omitting nonfatal, chronic diseases that affect quality of life [8]. At the same time, a focus on noncommunicable or chronic diseases has gained support as the morbidity and comorbidity of chronic diseases in the general population have increased [9]. The measurement of the burden of diseases, or Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), was initiated in 1992, with three major goals: (1) to provide information on nonfatal health outcomes, as most of the health policies are generally focused on mortality; (2) to develop epidemiological assessments for major disorders without bias; and (3) to quantify the burden of disease with a measure that could also be used for cost-effectiveness analysis [10]. Research is currently being conducted in different countries for diverse risk factors, such as recent analyses of the global burden of disease due to ischemic heart disease, and to determine if there is epidemiological convergence across countries [1, 11]. Different approaches have been taken in burden of disease studies, including disability weights to cover the burden of disease more elaborately [12]. The foremost milestone, one of the most important milestones, of the GBD study was the development of the composite indicator disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which is being used throughout diverse academic research as a summary measure of the overall burden of disease and is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability, or early death [8].",

To analyze the burden of disease using nationally representative big data, disease codes (KCD) that are collected as part of the patient's health care utilization have to be categorized by definitions of the causes of disability and death in previous burden of disease studies [14]. In other words, the disease codes are regrouped and redistributed into different clusters to define risk factors [15]. However, previous studies have not included the portion of health care utilization classified under U codes when calculating the burden of diseases by disability and death causes, although the nationally representative data include information for health care utilization coded under the U codes, such as the number of visits and costs [16]. Therefore, an understanding of the U codes from the perspective of Western medicine is needed to redistribute the uncalculated burden of diseases under U codes to other codes.",

Subdisease codes can be used for diseases other than the main disease in many cases. To avoid this problem, only subdisease codes that were relevant to the main U codes were selected by doctors of Korean medicine, and the final decision was based on agreement of trained KMD doctors. For example, in the case of U303 (neck stiffness), the codes that were not directly related to pain or abnormal sensation of the neck, such as digestive disorders or urinary disorders, were removed. This process was based on consultation with medical professionals and professors and researchers at the College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, as well as review of the beta version of ICD-11, which includes traditional medicine in its structure based on the ICTM. By reviewing the beta version of ICD-11, the definition and explanation for each of the disorders or patterns in the U code were studied for the specific symptoms or signs replaced by KCD 6 codes. Symptoms or signs of the disorders or patterns in the U code that were not mentioned in the corresponding ICD-11 definition were removed before data analysis.",

It is important to note that the portion of Korean medicine health care service that is not covered by NHIS is fairly large; therefore, a large part of Korean medicine health care utilization would not have been reported in the NHIS-NSC data [29, 30]. Second, the analysis was conducted for the 30 most common U codes in the NHIS data for the year 2012, which could have produced two issues. First, the most common U codes could change by year, with trends in health care utilization, which could therefore change the burden of disease. Also, the proportion that this study added to the current analysis of the burden of disease could change over time, yielding different data in another year. However, since this study aimed to produce the proportion in which the burden of disease for the year 2012 could develop, these two problems did not cause major errors in the current project.
