Few focused on migrant population, none of them interpreted all stages of delays systematically and none were based on national level data. Furthermore, there was no study specifically addressing transferred-out migrant patients with TB. This subgroup of patient among migrant TB has higher risk of unfavourable outcomes. At the time of patient registration, the TBIMS systematically collects information on symptom onset and first doctor visit along with date of diagnosis and treatment initiation. It also collects information on permanent residence. This provides us an opportunity to study risk factors for delay at country level among migrant TB patients that were transferred out during treatment in China. The findings on extent of treatment non evaluation among transferred out migrant TB patients and its risk factors will be published elsewhere.",

Age, gender and variables with unadjusted p value < 0.20 were considered in the models. First, the variable with lowest unadjusted p value was added followed by the variable with the next lowest unadjusted p value. At each step, the variable was retained if the likelihood ratio test was significant (p < 0.05).

We did not adjust for this factor (urban/rural) in our analysis. Secondly, it might be related to the annual health examination (including TB) especially among people working at industries or companies where people migrated and worked, having high chance of early diagnosis and treatment [33, 34]. Thirdly, patients probably benefitted from the public-public mix collaboration among different public health providers and TB designated facilities which was implemented after severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic [35]. Fourth, there were very few private practitioners in China, most health providers were public hospitals. According to national law and regulation of infectious diseases control, all health facilities must report TB cases within 24 h after diagnosis and refer them to programme BMUs since 2004 [36, 37]. BMUs must trace these referred patients with TB and get them involved in programme management [22]. These mandatory requirements possibly shortened the health system diagnosis delay compared to historical studies before in China [38, 39]. On the other hand, providing free anti-tuberculosis drugs by programme BMUs reduced the health system treatment delay [22], which was also relatively shorter than most other low-middle income countries [4, 13, 40], while similar as in South Africa [41].",

Compared with pleurisy, patients with sputum smear positive were associated with delay. It might be that TB symptoms were relatively more severe among pleurisy patients [42]. This study also found that patients with 15\u201344 years of age were less likely to have delays than older age group. This finding contradicts with the finding from India where patients < 45 years of age were at higher risk for delay [43].

In order to change this situation, firstly migrant population needs to be treated equally under universal health coverage. Providing subsidies to migrant patients with TB could effectively encourage them visit doctors and reduce the patient delay, and ensure them stay in the diagnosed place to complete treatment [46, 47].",
