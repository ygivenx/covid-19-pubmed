These EIDs, mostly zoonotic or emerging from animal reservoirs and adapting to human transmission, have included Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), some forms of malaria, bacterial food-borne diseases, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Q fever, influenzas (H1N1, H5N1), Ebola, Nipah and West Nile virus disease [1]. Each outbreak and epidemic can be characterized as a single case, attributable to specific causes and responses can be initiated using biomedical expertise and procedures. Treatments include triage, emergency medical care and delivery of appropriate drugs. Based on what was learned in that initial response, recommendations are made for prevention\u2014usually using the same model which worked well in the emergency phase: the application of top-down technical expertise. For EIDs, these recommendations have tended to focus on better surveillance and vaccine development and delivery [2,3].",

However, just as an acceleration and clustering in numbers of individual cases can be redefined at a larger scale as an epidemic or pandemic, so the accelerated outbreaks of EIDs comprise a pandemic of epidemics, emerging from deeper, systemic problems.

Other researchers have taken a broader view, identifying what were called drivers of EID emergence, rather than causes (as used in treating individual cases) or determinants (the term most often used by epidemiologists) of EIDs. A 1992 report by the Institute of Medicine in the USA, for instance, suggested that drivers of EIDs included human demographics and behaviour; technology and industry; economic development and land use; international travel and commerce; microbial adaptation and change and breakdown of public health measures [4]. Nevertheless, a 2012 review of progress in the 20 years since the original report noted the emergence of several new diseases, such as SARS and H5N1, and highlighted \u2018genomics-associated advances in microbial detection and treatment, improved disease surveillance, and greater awareness of EIDs and the complicated variables that underlie emergence\u2019 [5].

The authors recommended that governments work to \u2018improve daily living conditions, including the circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work and age\u2019; and \u2018tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money and resources\u2014the structural drivers of those conditions\u2014globally, nationally and locally\u2019.

The MEA used the term human well-being more or less synonymously with the 1948 WHO definition of health, which encompasses \u2018complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u2019 [11].",

Academic researchers have been able to map out the linkages across temporal\u2013spatial scales and disciplines necessary to address more fully the complexity of EIDs [12]. The authors of that paper\u2014all scientists\u2014argued that some form of transdisciplinarity was required but also acknowledged the institutional and logistical barriers to achieving such an approach. Ecosystem approaches to health (Ecohealth) grew out of a community of researchers focused on international development. Although drawing on quantitative epidemiological modelling, Ecohealth practitioners have tended to prefer more qualitative, community-based approaches, with health as one outcome of complex social-ecological changes [13]. One Health emerged from attempts to provide economic justifications for integrated animal\u2013human initiatives and to coordinate the activities of trans-national organizations such as the WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [14,15]. Other integrative approaches, often involving some combination of modelling and narrative, have been proposed by researchers in the social sciences and the humanities [16\u201319]. These newer integrative approaches are solidly grounded in a vast body of scholarly literature, theory, practice and organizational experience of those working in business, ecology, policy, philosophy of science, social change and environmental management [20\u201323].",

Some might argue that EIDs, like many of the other problems we face\u2014changing human demographics, climate change, heterogeneous food shortages and gluts, regional war, species extinctions and loss of biodiversity\u2014are the products of an over-populated, over-consuming world, which itself is an outcome of earlier scientific and technical successes. If this is so, however, then this should give us pause: if scientists are so good at teasing out causes and effects, and predicting outcomes, why did not they see this coming? The European Environment Agency has reported on some aspects of this problem in two publications reviewing what they call \u2018Late lessons from early warnings\u2019. The first report, published in 2001, considers cases from 1896 to 2002 [24]. The authors of that report note that standard regulatory and scientific approaches do not handle the kinds of uncertainty and ignorance that are inherent in dealing with \u2018complex, cumulative, synergistic or indirect effects\u2019. The analysis of how the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic unfolded is particularly relevant to EIDs, as it reveals the degree to which scientific advisors acquiesced to the government's reassuring narrative, constructed to maintain public and business stability, even when the evidence suggested other, more troubling, narratives. Some have referred to this tendency for scientific acquiescence to, or marginalization from, monetarily driven narratives as leading to \u2018policy-based evidence\u2019, that is, the converse of \u2018evidence-based policy\u2019 [25].",

The focus is narrow, the path to success achieved by, race-horse-like, wearing blinders, peripheral vision (awareness of context) is denigrated as irrelevant and theories and values are assumed and poorly understood. As scholarly understanding of the spatial and temporal contexts for EIDs have expanded outwards to encompass regional and global pathways, and deepened into characterization of the molecular structures of agents and the proteins with which they interacted in people, some researchers attempted to create more complicated mathematical models. The idea is that one brings together \u2018under one roof\u2019 information about atoms, molecules, laboratories, homes, wildlife, farms, insects, men, women, kitchens, schools, communities, populations and landscapes\u2014and relationships among all these. At some point, however, the models have become unworkable. The more precise they are, and the more variables they include, the more unwieldy and the less useful they become [26]. If models include more variables than well-defined independent equations, unique solutions cannot be obtained. Even at its best, systems modelling tends to focus on relatively stable relationships among variables and obscures the longer-term narratives and the values from which those relationships have emerged, and the instability of many relationships.",

Since there is no definitive problem formulation, and scientific uncertainties confound all formulations, they cannot be resolved in any definitive manner. Solving one part of a wicked problem may exacerbate other parts. Health presents a set of wicked problems, with multiple possible, and sometimes contradictory, evidence-based solutions [30]. Public health initiatives that involve draining swamps or spraying pesticides may control a disease, but compromise other aspects of health related to environmental sustainability, livelihoods or nutrition. Those other outcomes may then feedback to undermine or even worsen the original, successfully achieved, outcome. Linear causal models and responses that work well within short temporal and spatial frames are inadequate for dealing with outcomes embedded in complex ecological and social relationships. To list drivers of EIDs as a list of independent variables is deceptive; they are entangled in complex spatial and temporal webs in which relationships change over time.

Another constraint was the fact that, when animals are crowded together, they are more likely to shed higher numbers of bacteria, which then put flocks at greater risk for spreading epidemic diseases [48]. In the period after World War II, however, orthodox natural scientific methods came to the rescue: agricultural scientists were able to formulate feeds fortified with vitamins and antibiotics.

Nor have the linear narratives and logic of orthodox science been able to make apparent and manage the connections between increasing poultry production, systems of energy production, distribution and use, jungle clearance in Brazil (to grow soy protein), disappearing fish stocks in Peru (for fishmeal) and the even larger issues related to global changes in climate and biodiversity.",

It is one thing to document in detail the cellular and biochemical structure of dead ducks in a marsh in Saskatchewan, as well as, more recently, the microbiomes they carry, or those of dead chickens in a barn in British Columbia. It is quite another thing to understand the relationships among multiple species at multiple scales.",

They are mainly being paid by impoverished farmers and food industry workers; by millions of non-human species whom we abuse (in the system); by wild species whose habitats we are invading and destroying; by our grandchildren, whose choices are increasingly constrained; by already underfunded healthcare and public health systems and of course by the victims of consequent diseases.",

Certainly, the cost at the grocery store is higher for ecologically based farming. Those food costs could be off-set by variations of wealth distribution that range from traditional kin-sharing networks, cooperatives and voluntary associations to broader social safety nets, welfare states, social democratic programmes and guaranteed incomes.

For these \u2018post normal\u2019 questions, there will forever be scientific, scholarly, cultural, political and economic conflicts; they cannot, by definition, be resolved by gathering more data. Certainly the kinds of screaming fits that otherwise serious scholars have engaged in over, for instance, climate change, GMOs and BSE would seem to be not only undignified but undermine any serious confidence the general public might have in scientific research and scholarship. And circling the academic wagons into the more than 7000 scholarly journals currently being published is a kind of retreat. Yet scholars interested in policy applications, and with commitments to One Health, have obligations to engage with the conflicts and contradictions generated by their work and its relationships to policy.",

If complexity is taken seriously, and not just as a technical modelling issue, then notions of expertise, and monitoring, and facts, and the role of scientists and scholars, all change in some fundamental ways. As the late ecosystems scholar James Kay asserted:Investigators into complexity do not seek prediction, control, right answers and efficiency. These are not sensible goals under conditions of complexity. Rather, the investigators seek understanding, adaptability and resilience. Scientific inquiry, more than ever, becomes an act of collaborative learning and knowledge integration. The role of the expert shifts from problem solving to an exploration of possibilities, from giving correct advice to sharing information about options and trade-offs. Those who cling to being the old sort of expert in fact lose their expertise.Because there is no correct answer and no definitive perspective, decision-making under complexity will require new institutional arrangements, and broad public participation [61, p. 80].",
