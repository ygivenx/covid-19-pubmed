Recently, several novel members of Mastadenovirus were identified, and more than 40 species were registered in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Interestingly, several reports indicated cross-species transmission of viruses in Mastadenovirus. For example, canine adenoviruses (CAdVs), the causative agents for canine hepatitis (CAdV1) or respiratory diseases (CAdV2), classified into species Canine mastadenovirus A, could be transmitted to various carnivore species including foxes1,2. Moreover, cross-species transmissions of viruses in Mastadenovirus even among primates including humans have also been reported3\u20135. Therefore, we need to revisit the possibility that host range of viruses in Mastadenovirus could be wider than previously thought.",

The receptor on the cell surface is one of the major viral host range determinants17\u201319. Although several molecules have been reported as adenovirus receptors20\u201324, majority of adenoviruses, including CAdV2, use coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptors (CXADR or CAR) via their fiber proteins25\u201327. The CXADR is a 46-kDa type I transmembrane protein with an extracellular region composed of two immunoglobulin-like domains26, having a major role in forming cellular tight junctions28. CXADR homologs are conserved in vertebrates such as human, mice, rats, dogs, bats, and zebrafish29. Therefore, it is possible that BtAdVs may use CXADR as a functional receptor to infect various cell cultures.",

To isolate viruses, we inoculated antibiotics-treated fecal samples into several cell lines of different animal origins. Among them, we observed extensive CPE such as cell rounding, exfoliation, and death in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, following inoculation with samples from Myotis macrodactylus and Vesperitilio sinensis microbats (Fig. S1). These two isolates were identified as having less than 100 nm particle size through a membrane filtration test, resistant to chloroform treatment, and susceptible to a pyrimidine analog 5-iodo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine. Moreover, we observed adenovirus-like particles by transmission electron microscopic analysis (Fig. 1B). We strongly presume from these data that these two isolates were adenoviruses.",

On the other hand, the virus from V. sinensis (referred as BtAdV-Vs9) showed the highest identity (75%) to CAdV2 in Canine mastadenovirus A. For confirmation, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the complete genome sequences (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Data 1) or the DNA polymerase amino acid sequences (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Data 2). Both of our isolates belonged to BtAdV group 1 in the genus Mastadenovirus. Species demarcation in the genus Mastadenovirus is determined by a criterion that there is a 15% or more difference in the phylogenetic distance, based on distance matrix analysis of the DNA polymerase amino acid sequence, as described by the ICTV (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_9th_report/dsdna-viruses-2011/w/dsdna_viruses/93/adenoviridae). The phylogenetic distances between BtAdV-Vs9 and the viruses in group 1 species such as Bat mastadenovirus A, B, G, and CAdV1/2 in Canine mastadenovirus A were 22.0%, 23.9%, 19.8%, and 22.4/20.9%, respectively.

To approach this issue, we inoculated mice with these isolates intranasally or orally, and examined for disease signs or serology. Sera collected from orally-inoculated mice at 21 days post-inoculation were negative for neutralization antibodies. In contrast, sera collected from intranasally-inoculated mice became antibody-positive in the neutralization test; the antibody titers were 320, 160, and 320 in three mice infected with Mm32 and 20, 160, and 80 in three mice infected with Vs9, respectively. These data indicated that our BtAdV isolates were capable of infecting mice. None of the mice showed appreciable disease signs and died when intranasally-inoculated during the course of infection. However, the body weight gain of the BtAdV-Vs9-infected mice was significantly lower than that of mock-infected mice (Fig. 3). Additionally, we detected viral DNAs in the lung and intestine of 83% of sacrificed mice at 21 days post-infection with both viruses. These data indicated that although our isolates could infect mice, their pathogenicities were low.",

However, no cross-neutralization was observed between the two BtAdVs and between BtAdVs and CAdVs. Contrastingly, in the IFA, anti-BtAdV-Mm32 and anti-CAdV1 sera showed strong reaction to heterologous as well as homologous viruses, whereas anti-BtAdV-Vs9 and anti-CAdV2 sera showed faint reaction to heterologous viruses compared to homologous viruses (Fig. 4B).

We obtained three clones of cells (cCXADR-KO1, -KO2, and -KO3) and confirmed the lack of cCXADR expression by sequencing and western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). To analyze viral entry into these cells, BtAdVs or CAdVs were inoculated in either KO or wild-type (WT) cells, followed by detection of viral antigens by IFA at 24 h post-inoculation (hpi). The numbers of BtAdV as well as CAdV antigen-positive cells were much lower in KO than in WT cells (Fig. 6B,C), suggesting that attachment and entry of both viruses to the cells were hampered by knocking out the cCXADR. To totally evaluate viral growth in cCXADR-KO cells, we determined growth kinetics of BtAdVs or CAdVs (Fig. 6D). Viral titers of all the viruses were lower in KO than in WT cells at each time-point post-infection. These results indicate that cCXADR plays a crucial role in the viral entry and replication of BtAdVs as well as CAdVs in MDCK cells.",

Both viruses were derived from Myotis bats, M. macrodactylus (Fig. S1) and M. ricketti, distribution areas of these two species did not overlap. Since Myotis bats belong to a highly species-rich genus, which inhabit across the world32, similar BtAdVs might be widely distributed on earth. Moreover, M. macrodactylus often forms mixed colonies with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Murina hilgendorfi, or Miniopterus fuliginosus in Japan. Although we did not detect viruses in these bat species, mode of their living may correlate to viral spread among bat colonies.

However, considerable levels of viral replication were still observed in CXADR-KO cells (Fig. 6D). These data suggest the presence of multiple functional receptors in MDCK cells for BtAdVs and CAdVs. The studies with human adenoviruses have revealed the presence of alternative receptors, such as integrins or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in addition to CXADRs33,34. Notably, group 2 and 3 BtAdVs possess integrin binding RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motifs in penton base proteins, which recognize integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b2533. Contrastingly, while neither group 1 BtAdVs including BtAdV-Mm32 and -Vs9 nor CAdVs had the RGD motif in such proteins, our isolates possessed LDV (Leu-Asp-Val) motif in \u03b11\u03b24 integrin binding pIIIa minor capsid protein35. These observations imply that our isolates possibly use other molecules such as integrins on cell surface. These ideas indicate that host specificities of adenoviruses are regulated by multiple receptor molecules.",

Our isolates possessed 4 out of 5 conserved amino acid residues in fiber proteins that are responsible for interaction with CXADR36 (Table 1) and may use several mammalian-derived CXADRs as their functional receptors.
