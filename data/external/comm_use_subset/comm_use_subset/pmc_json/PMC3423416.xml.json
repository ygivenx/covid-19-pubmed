BMPs, like all other members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily, signal via specific membrane receptors that have serine-threonine kinase catalytic activity [9]. Functional BMP receptor units are composed of two Type-I and two Type-II receptor polypeptides. Four different Type-I BMP receptors (ALK2, ALK3/BMPRIa, ALK6/BMPRIb and ALK1), and three Type-II receptors (BMPRII, ActRIIA and ActRIIB) have been identified [10]. Upon ligand binding, the constitutively active Type-II receptors phosphorylate and thus activate their Type-I partners, which in turn phosphorylate their intracellular targets, the receptor-regulated Smad proteins 1, 5 and 8. Phosphorylated Smads form complexes with the \u201ccommon\u201d Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate expression of their target genes, synergistically with other transcription factors [8], [11]. BMPs can also signal via Smad-independent intracellular pathways that involve mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases [12], [13].",

Disruption of BMP signaling by ectopically expressing the BMP antagonists noggin or gremlin in the lung epithelium [15], [22], inactivating BMP receptors [16] or expressing a dominant negative form of the BMP Type-I receptor (dnALK6) result in abnormal distal lung architecture. Remarkably, over-activation of the BMP pathway is also incompatible with normal lung development. Ectopic over-expression of Bmp4 in the epithelium leads to smaller lungs and to substantially reduced epithelial cell proliferation [14] and mice with deletion of the BMP antagonist Follistatin-Like 1 (Fstl1) gene die at birth from respiratory distress and show multiple defects in lung development [23], [24].",

Moreover, characterization of the mechanisms by which BMPs affect adult lung homeostasis and tissue repair is still rudimentary. The current study was based on the premise that identification of the actual cellular targets of BMP mediated signaling during lung development, homeostasis and adult lung tissue repair will facilitate interpretation of earlier genetic studies, guide rational targeting of BMP signaling components in future experiments and contribute to the clarification of the mechanisms of action of this signaling system. Therefore, utilizing a mouse transgenic line carrying the eGFP reporter gene under the control of a canonical BMP pathway responsive regulatory element [33] we have constructed a detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP signaling in the lung and identified putative cellular targets of this signaling pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-injury repair. Our studies suggest that canonical BMP pathway plays key roles during early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of lung epithelial cell progenitors during late lung development and repair of adult lung tissue injury.",

The kinetics of mRNA expression for eGFP and the BMP target gene Id1 were analyzed by quantitative PCR. EGFP and Id1 mRNA levels followed similar kinetics to eGFP protein expression, reaching maximum levels around birth (Figure 2A). P1 lungs were therefore enzymatically digested and lung cells were separated by cell sorting on the basis of eGFP expression into eGFP negative (eGFPneg), eGFPlow (eGFPlow) and eGFP high (eGFPhigh) cells (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from the isolated population demonstrated good correlation between expression of eGFP and levels of pSmad1/5/8 (Figure 2C, D). Analysis of the mRNA levels for eGFP and BMP-regulated target genes such as Smad6, Id1 and Id3 demonstrated very good correlation between the level of eGFP expression and the activation of known BMP targets (Figure 2E). Interestingly, expression of Id2 mRNA did not correlate with levels of eGFP expression. Furthermore, treatment of embryonic lung explants ex-vivo with either BMP- or TGF\u03b2-receptor inhibitors resulted in either suppression or augmentation of BRE-eGFP transgene expression, respectively (see below Figure 3B). Moreover, treatment of embryonic lung explants with FGF10, a known inducer of BMP4 production by distal endodermal cells, or recombinant BMP4 resulted in substantial up-regulation of eGFP expression (Figure S3). Treatment of the lung explants with purmorphamin, a Shh agonist, resulted in redistribution of the eGFP staining pattern that involved a small increase of eGFP expression in a narrow zone of sub-mesothelial cells and a reduction of eGFP expression in the more central parts of the mesenchyme. This pattern of expression could stem from a Shh mediated reduction in FGF10 synthesis by mesenchymal cells [35] that in turn leads to a more confined BMP expression zone.",

As shown in Figure S4, nuclear pSmad1/5/8 was detected in regions with intense eGFP immuno-staining demonstrating consistency between BRE-eGFP reporter activity and pSmad1/5/8 immuno-staining (figure S4). Unfortunately, in our hands the anti-pSmad1,5,8 reagents we have analyzed so far were unable to detect pSmad1/5/8 in lung tissues from embryos before stage E19.5 and thus we were not able to confirm correlation of eGFP and pSmad1/5/8 at earlier developmental stages. A number of studies have indicated that the value of measuring pSmad1/5/8 as the sole indicator for canonical BMP pathway activation is questionable since presence of pSmad1/5/8 does not necessarily lead to transcriptional activity of BMP target genes. Canonical BMP pathway activity is known to be regulated by cell type-specific Smad-interacting transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors. For example Tbx1 can bind to Smad1, interfere with Smad1/Smad4 interaction and decrease BMP transcriptional activity without affecting the amount of pSmad1/5/8 in the responding cell [42]. Furthermore, Leeuwis et al. [41] demonstrated that in the kidney of BRE-eGFP animals, whereas the expression pattern of BRE-eGFP exhibited excellent correlation with the expression of the BMP7 and the BMP target genes Id1, and Smad6, in contrast pSmad1/5/8 exhibited a brought expression pattern that did not correlate with the expression of BRE-eGFP, BMP7, Id1 or Smad6. Therefore, a safer assessment of canonical BMP pathway should combine analysis of several known BMP target genes and pSmad1/5/8 immuno-stainings when this is technically possible. Collectively, the analysis by Monteiro et al. [33], Leeuwis et al. [41] and the results described herein indicate that the BRE-eGFP transgenic line reports quite faithfully activation of the canonical BMP pathway in-vivo and ex-vivo and thus it provides an additional method for assessing potential canonical BMP pathway activation.",

The eGFP expression, which interestingly involved only a portion of the sub-epithelial SMCs, was undetectable by P15. It has been proposed that sub-epithelial SMCs originate from a pool of sub-mesothelial, FGF10-expressing, mesenchymal cells. Under the influence of several signalling pathways, such as those mediated by FGF, BMP, Shh, and Wnt, these cells proliferate and passively translocate to surround the proximal portion of the developing airway tree [35], [43], [44], [45], [46]. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160611010189 - bb0125To map more precisely the temporal activation of the BRE-eGFP reporter during development of the sub-epithelial SMC compartment we isolated P11, P12 and P13.5 lungs from the BRE-eGFP reporter animals and analysed co-expression of eGFP and SM22a, a marker of both primitive and mature SMCs [47], or \u03b1SMA a marker of more differentiated SMCs. As shown in Figure S1B, SM22\u03b1 expression was observed in a sub-epithelial population of cells around the developing proximal airways already at embryonic stage E11, \u03b1SMA expression was evident only in the most proximal portion of the SM22apos zone and eGFP expression was clearly detected in the \u03b1SMApos zone only after embryonic stage E13.5 (very few \u03b1SMApos cells expressed very low levels of eGFP at E12). These findings are consistent with the notion that canonical BMP signalling does not involve primitive SMCs but rather mature \u03b1SMA expressing sub-epithelial SMCs.",

As shown in Figures 1 and 4A, minimal eGFP expression was detected around E14.5 in the large airways, and only after E17 strong eGFP signal was detected in cartilaginous and large airways following a proximal-distal axis pattern, with more intense signal in the proximal part of the bronchial tree. Immunostaining of BRE-eGFP lung tissue sections with an antibody specific for the Clara cell specific differentiation marker Scgb1a1/CCSP/CC10 (hereafter referred to as CC10), revealed expression of the eGFP reporter from E17.5 and onwards, in luminal cells of the developing airways. Strong CC10 expression was detected around E19.5, approximately two days after the onset of eGFP expression in the airway epithelium (Figure 4A) CC10 and eGFP exhibited partially overlapping zones of expression, with eGFP being highly expressed in the proximal portion and CC10 highly expressed in the distal portion of the developing airway tree. A zone of eGFPpos-CC10pos cells appeared to separate the CC10pos epithelial population from the eGFPpos airway regions. Postnatal expansion of CC10pos regions in the conducting airways was accompanied by a gradual reduction of the eGFPpos regions (Figure 4A).",

One model suggests that mesenchymal derived FGF10 induces Bmp4 expression by the distal bud epithelium to limit, in an autocrine manner, Fgf10-mediated bud outgrowth [45], [50]. The other model, based on the differential response of the distal epithelial buds to BMP4 in the presence or absence of mesenchyme, proposes that Bmp4 produced by the distal epithelium acts in an autocrine manner to limit proliferation of distal epithelial buds, and in a paracrine manner, on the adjacent mesenchyme, to induce production of a mesenchymal signal that enhances proliferation of distal epithelial buds [51]. Thus, according to the latter model the negative or positive effect of BMP signalling on branching is the outcome of a dynamic balance between negative autocrine and positive paracrine mechanism.",

Therefore, mesenchyme free distal epithelial buds and epithelial free mesenchyme were isolated as previously described [35], [36] and cultured in Matrigel. Remarkably, within 8 hours of incubation, the BRE-eGFP reporter was strongly up-regulated in the mesenchyme-free epithelial buds and conversely it exhibited a tendency for decline in the isolated mesenchyme (Figure 5). These findings are consistent with the model of Bragg et al.

As shown in figure 6 and Figure S2, eGFP staining during the pseudoglandular stage was confined to endothelial cells and peri-bronchial smooth muscle cells of the proximal airways. Pro-SpCpos epithelial cells in the distal airways were uniformly eGFPneg at this developmental stage (Figure S2).In contrast, starting at the canalicular stage (E17) and persisting until approximately P15, a population of eGFPpos-pro-SpCpos cells emerged in the distal lung compartments (Figure 6A).The SpCpos cells at this stage of development are thought to be immature type-II pneumocytes [55]. Morphometric analysis demonstrated that during the saccular and alveolar stages, approximately half of the pro-SpCpos alveolar cells were eGFPpos. Adult tissues, in which alveolarization was complete, contained a very small number of eGFPpos-pro-SpCpos alveolar cells (\u223c0.5\u20131%) (Figure 6B). High resolution confocal microscopy analysis revealed that at all the developmental stages analyzed only a very small portion of type-I pneumocytes were eGFPpos (Figure S7). Interestingly, ectopic over-expression of a constitutive ALK3 in cultures of adult primary pulmonary cells resulted in increased pro-SpC (\u223c6-fold) and Id1 (\u223c15 fold) mRNA levels, in comparison to the untreated or ALK5ca treated groups (Figure 6C) further implicating canonical BMP-signaling in the physiology of type-II pneumocytes.",

The conclusion that canonical BMP signaling becomes crucial for lung epithelial cell development at the cannalicular stage is consistent with earlier genetic studies demonstrating that deletion of Bmpr1 [16], [18] or Smad1 [19] and ectopic expression of negative regulators of BMP signaling such as XNoggin and dominant-negative ALK6 [15] by SpC-promoter-driven expression, resulted in defects in lung development visible only around E15-E16, i.e. after completion of the branching morphogenesis.",

BrdUpos cells accounted for \u223c6.7% of the surface airway epithelium in conducting airways and were uniformly distributed throughout the airway tree (Figure 7A).

Adult BRE-eGFP animals were analysed in two established models of lung tissue injury and repair, namely the naphthalene and bleomycin induce lung injury models. Naphthalene treatment causes selective depletion of Clara cells in the airways [59]. In contrast, bleomycin causes epithelial cell death, acute inflammation and fibro-proliferative remodeling of the peripheral lung [60]. Immuno-staining for CC10 and CGRP demonstrated that by day 3, naphthalene treatment had caused a large reduction in CC10pos cells in the airways, an increase in the number of CGRPpos cells per NEB, and a substantial increase in BRE-eGFP reporter activity at airway branch-points and terminal bronchioles (Figure 8A).This pattern of CC10 localization and eGFP reporter expression corresponds with previously determined anatomic locations that maintain chemically resistant epithelial progenitor cells [61], [62], [63], [64].",

During the first days of treatment the eGFPpos cells were primarily cuboidal SpCpos cells. From day-4 onwards both cuboidal and squamous eGFPpos cells were found in the alveolar regions. Interestingly, the squamous eGFPpos cells were T1\u03b1-expressing type-I pneumocytes and were always localized in the borders between affected and apparently normal tissue (Figure 9C). We postulate that the cuboidal eGFPpos cells observed in the early stages of the bleomycin induced response represent a reparatory progenitor population that expands and differentiates into the eGFPpos-T1\u03b1low cells observed in the later stages to repair the damaged alveolar epithelium. Further studies will be required, however, to validate this hypothesis.",

Our studies demonstrated that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis characterises lung development, canonical BMP pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the airway smooth muscle layer. Only after the completion of branching morphogenesis and the initiation of epithelial cell differentiation canonical BMP pathway activation commences in airway and alveolar epithelial cell that are enriched in progenitors that can form epithelial colonies in Matrigel in-vitro. The BRE-eGFP reporter is reactivated in mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that the low reporter activity in intact lungs is the result of a dynamic interplay between the endoderm and the mesenchyme and moreover suggest that the elusive, mesenchyme derived, epithelial growth promoting signal postulated by Bragg et al.

Remarkably, severe depletion of Clara cells in the adult lung by naphthalene treatment, leads to re-expression of the eGFP reporter around NEBs and terminal bronchioles, areas known to harbour airway progenitor cells. Likewise, injury of the alveolar epithelium in the adult lung by bleomycin treatment, leads to re-expression of eGFP initially in SpCpos cuboidal epithelial cells, which we postulated to be alveolar epithelial progenitors and subsequently in squamous T1\u03b1low cells which we postulated to be derived from the former population and on the way to differentiate to Type-I pneumonocytes. Our findings are compatible with the notion that during the late stages of lung development the role of canonical BMP signalling pathway is to maintain the undifferentiated state of the airway and alveolar epithelial progenitors preventing premature exhaustion of their pools and securing the continuous supply of the differentiated epithelial cells that are required for a fully developed lung. The reactivation of the BMP responsive reporter in adult animals undergoing repair of severe epithelial injury, where the same requirements regarding proper management of the undifferentiated epithelial progenitor pools apply, is also compatible with this conjecture. An analogous function has been previously proposed for BMP signaling regarding the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [66], [67] and the maintenance of the undifferentiated, multipotent state of distal lung progenitor cells [45], [68].",
