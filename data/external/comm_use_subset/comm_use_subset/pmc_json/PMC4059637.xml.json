The authors reported increased hospitalization rates among patients with viral co-infections compared to single respiratory viral infections (46.3% vs. 21.7%, p<0.01) suggesting increased severity with viral co-infections. These findings were limited, however, by including heterogeneous patient-populations (adults and children, with or without underlying comorbid conditions) and by combining studies using conventional as well as molecular methods for viral detection and by a potentially biased selection of the included studies.",

In addition, rigorous assessment of eligibility ensured high reliability of the results. All subgroups analyses, with the exception of age subgroups analyses, were defined a priori and post hoc sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of the results. Finally a rigorous use of the GRADE approach ensured a transparent and comprehensive approach to evaluate overall quality of the studies. Limitations predominantly relate to the high risk of bias of the included studies. Of note, no studies reported risk estimates adjusted for important prognostic factors such as underlying co-morbidities or bacterial co-infections. Although the influence of comorbid conditions was partially addressed in our subgroup analysis, an insufficient number of studies precluded some subgroup analyses we planned a priori. Respiratory viral infections are known to predispose to secondary bacterial pulmonary infections, and thus can result in substantial confounding [30]. Finally, age subgroup analyses were conducted post hoc. Based on the data available we were able to provide subgroups as defined above, but the data did not allow us to specify other, better discriminating age groups.",

Large, rigorously conducted studies including multivariable analyses adjusting for important confounders are lacking, and thus, new studies would be very likely to significantly change our overall assessment.
