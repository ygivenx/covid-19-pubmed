Transport of viruses between cells first involves the intracellular movement of the viral RNA from the site of replication to plasmodesmata (PDs) and then its delivery into neighboring cells through PDs. PDs are tunnels in the cell wall that connect the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane between adjoining cells (reviewed in [1]). The size exclusion limit (SEL) of PD is normally too small to allow passive transport of large molecular complexes, but plant viruses encode movement proteins (MPs) that increase the SEL of PDs to allow passage of the viral RNA (reviewed in [2], [3]). Intracellular movement likely involves a membrane-associated viral RNA-host and viral protein complex, but the exact configuration of the viral entity that enters the neighboring cells has not yet been determined (reviewed in [2], [4]). In the case of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the viral RNA appears to spread between cells as membrane MP-associated viral replication complexes (VRCs) [5]. For members of the comovirus and caulimovirus genera, viral particles transit through MP-induced tubules that go through PDs for their delivery into non-infected cells [6]\u2013[10].",

The cytoskeleton is an essential component of organelle trafficking in plant cells (reviewed in [11], [12]) and it has been shown to be involved in vertebrate virus intracellular movement (reviewed in [13]). In the case of TMV, several studies have shown that microtubules and microfilaments are necessary to anchor and release, or aid the movement of the VRC or MP granules often associated with ER (reviewed in [2], [4], [14]). Microfilaments influence the intracellular or intercellular transport of other MPs or viruses [15]\u2013[20]. Myosin motors are also required for MP or viral trafficking [6], [21]\u2013[24]. The secretory pathway is further involved in intra- and intercellular trafficking by several viruses [16], [17], [20], [21], [25], [26]. Finally, recent studies suggest that the endocytic transport pathway may be involved in viral movement [27], [28].",

In addition to polyprotein-derived polypeptides, an \u223c7 kDa protein termed PIPO is produced in infected cells [31] and is also found as a trans-frame protein consisting of the amino-terminal half of P3 fused to PIPO (P3N-PIPO) [32]. Potyviruses have no designated MP but many viral proteins have been reported to have MP-related functions. For instance, HCPro and the coat protein (CP) can increase PD SEL [33]. In addition, CP and cylindrical inclusion (CI) protein are required for virus intercellular movement [34]\u2013[36] and are associated with PD [37], [38]. Recently, the targeting of CI to PD was shown to be mediated by P3N-PIPO [39], which itself is targeted to the plasma membrane through an interaction with the host protein PCaP1 [32]. One last protein involved in viral movement is the 6 kDa membrane-associated 6K2 protein. It induces the production of motile vesicles that contain viral RNA and have been proposed to be the vehicle for intracellular trafficking of potyviral RNA [40], [41]. These findings, while providing a partial understanding of the mechanism of TuMV intracellular and intercellular movement, do not sufficiently explain the involvement of the host secretory pathway or the cytoskeleton in potyvirus movement.",

Virus spread is influenced by the rates of virus RNA replication and virus intercellular movement. Hence, the use of the above TEV-GUS construct to fully interpret results from virus spread studies is limited since virus replication in live tissue cannot be quantitated through GUS staining. In order to discriminate initially infected cells from later infected cells in live tissue, we introduced within the T-DNA borders of a binary vector a gene cassette expressing the ER-localized GFP-HDEL adjacent to a TuMV infectious genome cassette expressing 6K2:mCherry (Fig. 1A). Since both gene cassettes are delivered to the same cells and GFP-HDEL does not move between cells [28], primary infected cells should display concomitant green and red fluorescence while secondary infected cells should display red-only fluorescence. This system also allows differentiation between virus RNA replication and virus intercellular movement.",

Virus intercellular movement was assayed by observing red and green fluorescence at the perimeter of the infiltrated area.

This was achieved by securing an infiltrated leaf still attached to the plant on the confocal microscope stage for observation. When the perimeter of the agroinfiltrated area was initially imaged, intercellular movement have already begun as indicated by the presence of red-only fluorescent patches (Movie S1). To calculate the rate of cell-to-cell movement in cells/hour, we first measured the number of leaf epidermal cells for every linear 1 mm in three-week-old N. benthamiana plants and we calculated that 1 mm corresponded to 17.6 cells (n = 20). We then measured the distance from the agroinfiltrated front to the limit of expansion of the red fluorescence at the end of the observation period. In this experiment, the red-only fluorescence, indicative of TuMV secondary infection, had spread an average distance of 311 \u00b5m (n = 20) in the xy plane in 17 h. This expansion corresponded to a rate of one new infected cell every 3 hours. We repeated this experiment five times and we observed the same rate of cell-to-cell movement. This rate of intercellular movement was similar to that observed for TEV expressing GUS and for TMV [5], [34]. The increase in red fluorescence surface area was not due to the diffusion of 6K2:mCherry from agroinfected cells in the absence of virus spread because replacement of the TuMV cassette with a cassette expressing only 6K2-mCherry did not produce red-only fluorescent foci (Fig. S1A). These findings validated the use of the double cassette, GFP-HDEL and TuMV 6K2:mCherry to follow intercellular movement by TuMV.",

Concanamycin A (CMA) inhibits protein transport at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) [44] by inhibiting the function of TGN-localized proton-ATPases, which leads to the acidification of the TGN lumen [45]. To evaluate the influence of these secretory inhibitors on TuMV intercellular movement, N. benthamiana leaves were treated with DMSO, 10 \u00b5g/mL BFA or 0.5 \u00b5M CMA 4 h before pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL agroinfiltration. BFA at this concentration effectively blocked the secretory pathway (Fig. S1B). At 4 dpinf, DMSO alone had no inhibitory effect on TuMV movement (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, BFA and CMA treatment reduced cell-to-cell movement of TuMV (Fig. 2B\u2013C). The surface area for mCherry-only expressing foci for each treatment was measured and the statistical analysis confirmed the inhibitory effect of BFA and CMA on TuMV intercellular movement (Fig. 2D). This experiment was repeated two more times and the statistical data are presented in Fig. S2A. To assess whether or not BFA or CMA inhibited TuMV replication, we quantified mCherry fluorescence intensity over GFP fluorescence intensity in primary infection foci for all treatments. Fig. 2E shows that that there was no significant difference in the ratio of red over green fluorescence during BFA and CMA treatments compared with the no inhibitor treatment (TuMV alone) at 4 dpinf, indicating that viral protein production in the primary infected cells was not affected by the drug treatments. Green fluorescence levels were also similar between DMSO- and BFA- or CMA-treated primary cells indicating that steady state level of GFP, which was not associated with virus replication, was not affected by the treatments (data not shown).",

The ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) is a small GTPase regulating the recruitment of COPI coatomer proteins. A dominant negative mutant of ARF1 [ARF1(NI)] impaired in GTP/GDP binding inhibits the transport of soluble markers from the ER to Golgi, and causes a re-absorbance of Golgi membrane proteins into the ER [46]. RAB-E1d is a small Rab GTPase acting at a post-Golgi trafficking pathway and the dominant negative mutant RAB-E1d(NI) inhibits trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane [47]. These two dominant-negative mutants were co-infiltrated with pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. Four days post-agroinfiltration, red-only foci were reduced in the tissue co-infiltrated with the two mutant protein cassettes compared with those not infiltrated with these constructs, indicating reduced intercellular movement of TuMV in the presence of these secretory pathway inhibitors (Fig. 3B\u2013C). Surface area measurements for mCherry-only expressing patches confirmed the inhibitory effect of both ARF1(NI) and RAB-E1d(NI) on TuMV intercellular movement (Fig. 3D). This experiment was repeated two more times and the statistical data are presented in Fig. S2B. Expression of these two mutant proteins did not hamper virus protein production in primary infected cells as measured by red over green fluorescence ratios in the dual expressing regions of the infected leaves (Fig. 3E). We therefore concluded that inhibition of both early and late secretory pathways inhibited TuMV intercellular movement but did not affect virus replication in primary infected cells. The last assertion is in line with the prior observation that BFA treatment did not affect the production of TuMV-induced 6K2-tagged perinuclear structures and peripheral vesicles [48].",

In mammalian cells, Tyrphostin A23 inhibits the recruitment of endocytic cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles formed at the plasma membrane by preventing the interaction between the clathrin-binding AP-2 adaptor complex \u03bc2 subunit and the sorting motif within the cytoplasmic domain of plasma membrane proteins [49]. Tyrphostin A51 is a structural analog of Tyrphostin A23 but has no inhibitory effect and is routinely used as negative control [49]. Tyrphostin A23 is active in plant cells [50] and it has been shown that the drug inhibits endocytosis of some plasma membrane proteins [51]. Wortmannin is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor that inhibits in mammalian cells receptor sorting and/or vesicle budding required for delivery of endocytosed material to \u201cmixing\u201d endosomes [52]. In plant cells, it has been shown that the drug inhibits endocytosis of FM4-64 (an amphiphilic styryl dye used to monitor endocytosis) [53] and morphogenesis of MVB/PVCs [50], [54] but it does not affect protein transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane [55], [56].

Intracellular trafficking of 6K2-tagged vesicles, which contain viral RNA [40], [41], has been shown to be dependent on the secretory pathway and microfilaments [40], [48], [57]. Ara7 is a plant Rab protein similar to Rab5 of mammals and to Ypt51/Ypt52/Ypt53 of yeast, and is associated with prevacuolar compartments and involved in endocytic and vacuolar trafficking in plant cells [58], [59]. Co-expression of Ara7 fused to GFP and pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry in N. benthamiana leaves cells showed that there was no colocalization between Ara7 motile dots and 6K2-tagged vesicles (Fig. 5A). Also, 6K2-tagged vesicles were never associated with FM4-64-labeled vesicles (Fig. 5B). Lack of co-localization of FM4-64 and Ara7 with TuMV-induced 6K2-tagged vesicles further indicates that endocytic pathways associated with these markers were not important for TuMV cellular spread.",

However, recent studies showed that RNA viruses might have evolved differently in their requirements for actin and the associated myosin motors [22], [61]. We first tested the effect of Latrunculin B (LatB), and Cytochalasin D (CytD), which inhibit maintenance of microfilaments [62], on the intercellular spread of TuMV. Leaves were infiltrated with 5 \u00b5M LatB, 10 \u00b5M CytD, or DMSO 4 h before agroinfiltration with pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. The disruption of actin by LatB or CytD was confirmed by confocal microscopy observation of microfilaments labeled with the actin-binding domain 2 of A. thaliana fimbrin fused to GFP (GFP-ABD2-GFP) [63] (Fig. S1D). TuMV intercellular movement was assessed by imaging N. benthamiana leaves at 4 dpinf. Inhibition of TuMV intercellular movement was observed after LatB or CytD treatment (Fig. 6B\u2013D). This experiment was repeated two more times and the statistical data are presented in Fig. S3A. The ratio of red to green fluorescence in dual expressing cells was unchanged between treatments indicating that virus replication was unaffected by these microfilament antagonists (Fig. 6E). These results indicate that an intact microfilament network was important for TuMV intercellular movement, but not for replication. The last assertion is in line with the prior observation that LatB treatment did not affect the production of TuMV-induced 6K2-tagged perinuclear structures and peripheral vesicles [40].",

We were also interested to see if other myosins could be involved. Tobacco rattle virus-mediated virus-induced silencing (TRV-VIGS) was adopted to determine the role of myosins on intercellular movement of TMV, potato virus X (PVX), tomato bushy stunt virus, and turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV) [22]. We thus used TRV-VIGS to silence individual myosin genes prior to TuMV infection. N. benthamiana leaves were first infected with TRV constructs and 15 days later upper leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium strain containing pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. TuMV intercellular movement was quantified at 4 dpinf. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the transcriptional level of the target myosin genes was decreased in plants infected by the TRV silencing construct containing the corresponding genes (Fig. 7A). We then monitored TuMV intercellular movement by measuring areas of foci expressing mCherry-only. Quantification indicated that there was no significant difference in TuMV intercellular movement in mock- and TRV-infected plants (Fig. 7B and 7D). Virus movement was not affected in myosin VIII-1 and VIII-2-silenced plants. However, silencing of myosin XI-2 reduced TuMV intercellular movement by a factor of 10 compared to the control (Fig. 7B and 7D). Reduced TuMV movement was observed in myosin XI-F silenced plants, but was not found to be statistically significant. This experiment was repeated two more times and the data are presented in Fig. S3B. To be sure this effect on virus movement was specific to myosin XI-2 silencing, we analyzed the effect of silencing myosin XI-2 on the other myosins (Fig. 7C). Silencing myosin XI-2 had no significant effect on the transcript level of the other tested myosins.",

The replication was not affected by any dominant-negative myosin mutants assessed in this experiment (Fig. 8B). Results presented here indicate that myosin XI-2 and XI-K are required for intercellular movement of TuMV and that the other myosins analyzed did not appear to play a role in cell-to-cell movement of TuMV.",

            "text": "Using our dual gene cassette construct (Fig. 1), we first observed the green fluorescence at 48 hpinf, and mCherry fluorescence at 60 hpinf. This is the time frame normally observed when virus infection is initiated through agroinfiltration [64]\u2013[66]. TuMV intercellular movement was observed between 60 and 72 hpinf and progressed at a rate of one new infected cell per \u223c3 hours and systemic infection of the plant occurred at 4\u20135 dpinf. The intercellular rate of spread of TuMV was very close to that observed for TMV and TEV [5], [34]. Infections caused by mechanical inoculation with virus suspensions as opposed to agroinfiltration often result in measurable virus replication at 24 hpinf and systemic infection 2 days later [34]. The delay in observable infection in our agroinfiltration system may be explained by several factors. The first factor is that a T-DNA copy of the viral RNA genome is delivered in the cell. This T-DNA molecule must be transported to the nucleus and transcribed into RNA, which is then transported back in the cytoplasm. In the case of potyviruses, there may be an additional delay because the RNA transcribed from the T-DNA is not linked to VPg. There is consequently a first round of translation that needs to take place before bona fide infection begins. Lastly, monitoring fluorescence as opposed to viral RNA through an amplification system (e.g. RT-PCR) is likely less sensitive and requires maturation of the fluorescent marker [67]. Importantly, however, after the initial delay in infection, TuMV intercellular movement and systemic infection proceeded at the same rate as infections using purified viral particles. This indicates that the infiltrated agrobacterium did not cause an additional defense response by the plant that significantly impeded spread of TuMV beyond what is normally observed during virus infections. This latter finding further supports the use of our dual cassette construct as a valid tool to study virus intercellular movement.",

Although ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) proteins, which have a major role in the sorting of cargo proteins, are recruited for tomato bushy stunt virus replication [69], [70], it is not known if they have any involvement in virus movement. In the present study, we determined that in addition to the early secretory pathway, post-Golgi transport components were also required for TuMV intercellular movement (Fig. 2\u20133). Likely, this late secretory pathway is required for sorting the membrane-associated viral RNA-protein complex to PDs.",

In plant cells, myosins are classified into class VIII or class XI [71]. Among the myosins tested in this study, myosin XI-2 and XI-K were required for TuMV intercellular movement, but not myosin XI-F, VIII-1 or VIII-2 [39]. Class XI myosins are also required for normal sustained movement of TMV [22] and GFLV [6]. In the case of GFLV, it may be that myosin is required to transport a host factor to the PD that then supports GFLV movement. For TMV, it has been suggested that the influence of myosin XI-2 on its sustained intercellular spread may be through metabolism of virus products after virus movement, since the related tobamovirus TVCV does not require actomyosin for intercellular spread and TMV spreads normally for 24 h post treatment with a microfilament antagonist [22], [61], [72]. Previously, myosin XI-K was shown to be involved in the intracellular movement of TuMV 6K2 vesicles [41]. Myosin XI-K and myosin XI-2, but not other myosins, have been shown to be major facilitators for cellular motility between actin filaments and the ER [73]. It has also been shown that myosin XI-K localizes to the motile endomembrane vesicles associated with F-actin [71]. We suggest that there may be more than one myosin-dependent activity necessary for a single virus and its expressed proteins to spread in plants and that XI-2, together with XI-K, may be important for the movement of TuMV RNA complexes.",

Similarly, disruption of the early secretory trafficking by BFA inhibited intercellular virus movement of melon necrotic spot virus but did not modify its accumulation in infected cells [16]. Coronavirus-induced remodeling of the ER and viral replication equally took place in the presence of BFA [74]. Breakdown of actin filaments also did not affect the formation of TuMV 6K2-tagged vesicles [40]. These results suggest that replication activities, despite their requirement for membranes, are influenced separately from those involved in movement, although aspects of both are likely coordinated [75].",
