In the absence of prior information the use of diffusion motion allows us to impose few restrictions on the evolution of \u03b8(t). We consider that they follow a continuous diffusion process (a discrete diffusion process was used in [35]):\nd\u03b8(t)=\u03c3dB(t)ordlog(\u03b8(t))=\u03c3dB(t)(2)\nwhere \u03c3 is the volatility of the Brownian process (dB(t)) and will be estimated during the fitting process. The use of a Brownian process can be viewed as a weak hypothesis for the imposed motion of \u03b8(t) and the volatility \u03c3 being a regularized factor. Intuitively, the higher the values of \u03c3 the larger the changes in \u03b8(t). The logarithm transformation avoids negative values which have no biological meaning. When prior knowledge on \u03b8(t) is available this Brownian process can be modified to account for a drift in (2) (see [36]).",

            "text": "We start our demonstration by showing that it is possible to reconstruct both the trajectory of a SIRS model (SIRS stands for Susceptibles, Infectious, Removed and Susceptibles again) and that of the sinusoidal transmission rate. In this example, the trajectory of each variable has been simulated with a model for which all the parameters were known. Moreover we also knew the observation process that has generated the data, a Poisson law for the incidence with an observation rate equal to 1. Fig 1 displays the reconstructed trajectories of both the incidence and the transmission rate highlighting the potential of the method. The parameter estimations are in perfect agreement with the values used to generate the observations and the estimation process has correctly converged (S1 and S2 Figs). This clearly demonstrates the feasibility of accurately ascertaining the time evolution of the transmission rate and correctly estimating the Reff (see Fig 2). It is worth emphasizing that the SIRS model is a complicated example for different reasons. First, even with a constant transmission rate the SIRS model can generate oscillations (damped oscillations, see [17,44]). Secondly, the model trajectories are not very sensitive, a modification of \u00b1 10% can induce minor modifications of the trajectories that are inside or near the 95% CI of our inferences (Fig 2). Moreover in this example we have used initial conditions outside the attractor of the dynamics to generate transients that appear more realistic for real applications, but are more complex to reconstruct. The robustness of our approach has also been tested: (i) using long time series and initial conditions near the attractor (Fig 3A and S3A Fig); (ii) modifying the number of inferring parameters (S4\u2013S6 Figs), for instance estimating just the volatility parameter (S7 and S8 Figs); (iii) considering the possibility of not using the transformation log in the diffusion process (S9 and S10 Figs) and (iv) using a true \u03b2(t) with 2 or 3 periodic components (Fig 3B and 3C and S3B and S3C Fig).",

Monthly data from the capital Phnom Penh [47], for which the meteorological data is available from the international airport, was used. We can accurately describe the 12 year time series and reconstruct the time evolution of \u03b2(t) (Fig 6 and S17 Fig). Our results stress that the \u03b2(t) oscillations are more complex than a simple sinusoidal function. Sometimes bi-modality occurs over one season. In general one observes a fast growth of \u03b2(t) and a slow decrease. Moreover the amplitude of the \u03b2(t) varies from year to year, perhaps depending on the fluctuations in the mosquito population and in the environment. Interestingly the peak in \u03b2(t) appears 1 to 2 months before the incidence peak. This delay can be explained by the extrinsic incubation period and might be used in a warning system.",

We observed very significant coherency between \u03b2(t) and climate for the local climate for the seasonal mode (Fig 7 and S18\u2013S20 Figs) and also for the 2\u20133 year components with global climatic variable (S21 Fig). Thus, the rhythm of \u03b2(t) can be explained perfectly by climatic factors. Nevertheless, again mainly due to large non-stationarity, by using solely one or two climatic variables we are able to correctly describe dengue evolution in the short-term (Fig 7C, red area) but not over a large time period (Fig 7C, blue area). This reflects the complexity of such a disease where the ecology of the vectors, the environment, the climate, the immune status of the human population and its behavior are all involved. This large non-stationarity association between dengue and climatic factors has recently been demonstrated using statistical models (dynamic generalized linear models) and data from a medium-sized city in Colombia [49]. The authors showed that dengue cases correlate with climatic variables (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation and relative humidity) but these correlations change over time, some intervals showing a positive association, while in others the association is negative [49]. The non-stationarity association between dengue and climate may be explained by the fact that a climatic variable has different effects depending on the biological cycle of the pathogen or of the vector. Moreover the effects of one climatic variable can also depend on other climatic variables potentially enhancing the non-stationarity association.",

Firstly, our methodology was able to accurately reconstruct both the incidence and the sinusoidal transmission rate of a simple SIRS model just based on noisy observations (Figs 1\u20134 and S4,S5,S7,S9 and S14 Figs). Based on these reconstructions one can also closely estimate Reff which is one of the key relevant epidemiological parameters. Our results also highlight the flexibility of our developed methodology. It can reconstruct the time evolution of a shifting parameter (\u03b5S(t), see Fig 4 and S14 Fig) as well as an oscillating parameter that influences the nonlinear part of the model (\u03b2(t), see Figs 1\u20133 and S4,S5,S7 and S9 Figs). The comparison using goodness-of-fit indices with the inferred true model allows us to highlight the fact that our methodology performs as well for the observed incidence. Its flexibility results in greater variability in some other trajectories mainly \u03b2(t) and Reff (Table 1). Moreover, in the absence of knowledge of the true evolution of the transmission rate, our approach appears to capture the dynamic observed more accurately than a misspecified model (Table 2). Secondly, applied to real datasets, our framework is able, based solely on simple stochastic models, to reconstruct complex epidemics such as flu or dengue over long time periods (Figs 5 and 6). In such cases, the reconstruction of the time evolution of the transmission rate clearly stresses that, on real datasets, it is difficult to assimilate the dynamic of this parameter as a simple sinusoidal function. It is more irregular in amplitude and sometimes multi-modal over one season.",

Our data-driven methodology can be used as a first step towards a better understanding of a complex epidemic, where data is limited or lacks certainty. Indeed most of the unknowns and uncertainties can be put into time-varying parameters. The potential effects of all these uncertainties can then be explored by analyzing the reconstructed time evolution of the time-varying parameters. See Fig 7 for such preliminary analysis of dengue in Phnom Penh. This allows a more thorough analysis of the influences and the interactions between both the human behavior and complex environmental drivers. In a recent paper [50], the authors reviewed evidence of interactions between seasonal influenza virus and other pathogens (bacteria or virus). They concluded that it is important to incorporate these different coinfecting pathogens in models of seasonal flu in order to get a better estimate of the burden of influenza. Our framework could be an alternative to the development of complex models with all the potential interactions between pathogens and to estimate the strength of the interactions. After reconstructing the time evolution of the transmission rate the statistical association between the coinfecting pathogens and the transmission rate could be tested. This screening may facilitate the construction of more complex models that could incorporate only the most significant coinfecting pathogens in the seasonal flu model.",

This has previously been done in the case of HIV epidemics [34\u201335], where it was hypothesized that the reduction in the transmissibility was due to a modification of the sexual behavior in the population and the increase in the seropositive period duration due to the introduction of the first antiviral treatments. Evaluation of interventions has also been done recently in the case of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa [51]. The relative simplicity of our methodology is also suitable for short-term predictions and it can then easily be used to predict an epidemic in real time. Starting with a given estimated state defining the system, the fitting process can be run again each time new data is available and the new posteriors are used for new predictions [36]. This can inform public health decisions and indeed has been done recently to great effect in the case of the Ebola epidemics in West Africa [52].",

The question of identifiability is too often avoided in epidemiological models applied to a topical Public Health issues. There is, however, considerable literature on this subject (e.g. [41,42,53\u201355]). Identifiability is not evident even for a simple seasonal SIR model [56]. To solve this problem one can fit a combination of parameters or fix some of them (the population size for instance) [57]. In our applications there is a clear limitation due to practical non-identifiability of reporting rate and initial conditions. To fix these problems we have used informative priors (see Method). Using informative priors or fixing some parameters gives very similar results (compare Fig 1 and S4\u2013S7 Figs). Related to this is the misspecification of models [45]. In our cases, as with other semi-mechanistic models the time-varying parameter methodology captures some of the information in the data but not in the mechanistic part of the model. If the model is misspecified due to lack of precision, it compensates for it and the dynamics of \u03b2(t) will drive improvements in the model to make it more complex and realistic (Table 2). If the model is misspecified to the extent that it creates mechanisms that do not exist, the reconstructed \u03b2(t) would compensate for these effects but it will be harder to interpret.",
