Efforts to control and eradicate malaria are hampered by the accelerated evolution of drug resistance in the parasite. To date, the parasite has developed resistance to all major antimalarial drugs, raising concerns about the spread of drug-resistant parasites and the ability to effectively treat malaria [2]. The development of new technologies aimed at understanding parasite genome variability provides hope in identifying new drug targets, implementing smarter treatment plans, and ultimately reducing or eliminating the burden of malaria.",

The primary determinant of chloroquine resistance is a mutation in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene on chromosome (chr) 7 [3,4]. In vitro resistance to the antifolate drugs sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine increases in a step-wise manner as mutations accrue in dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase [5-8]. Varying copy number of the P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene on chr 5 influences parasite susceptibility to a range of antimalarial drugs, including mefloquine, lumefantrine, quinine, and artemisinin [9-11]. Amplification on chr 12 of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 of the folate biosynthesis pathway is correlated with antifolate drug resistance [12,13]. These examples emphasize the importance of genomic variation in drug resistance and need to assay both SNPs and CNV genome-wide in the malaria parasite.",

Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been successfully used to look at structural variation and CNV in multiple P. falciparum strains [12,15-17], while large-scale sequencing efforts identifying SNPs [18-20] have spurred the development of SNP microarrays. Neafsey et al. [21] genotyped 1,638 out of 3,000 queried SNPs with 100% accuracy using an Affymextrix 3K SNP assay. Mu et al. [22] used Affymetrix molecular inversion probe technology to genotype 2,763 of 3,354 SNPs with >90% call rate. Multiple groups have successfully applied CGH for SNP detection with 80 to 90% sensitivity to approximately 3,000 SNPs [23,24] and identified parameters influencing SNP detection [24,25]. However, the reported detection rates are based on a core subset of SNPs (approximately 3,000) in a genome with more than 100,000 cataloged SNPs (PlasmoDB v5.5) [26].",

We first empirically determined the optimum probe lengths and melting temperatures for SNP genotyping in the 81% AT P. falciparum genome. This was used to guide the design of a single high-resolution genotyping microarray with variable length probes optimized for high quality SNP genotyping and CNV detection (Figure 1). One half of the microarray interrogates 45,524 SNP loci using optimized resequencing probes 29 to 41 bp in length capable of making a base call at a precise nucleotide position [27]. The second half identifies CNV using tiled CGH probes 50 to 75 bp in length. We determine the reliability and accuracy of the CNV-SNP array using the laboratory lines 3D7, HB3, Dd2, SC05, and 7C126. We then validate the utility and robustness of the microarray using field samples with limited parasite DNA and high human DNA contamination present using blood collected from humans at the Thailand-Burma border.",

A base call is considered robust when a probe quartet has a single high nucleotide signal relative to the other three nucleotide signals, and the sense and antisense base calls are complementary. A Dscore calculating the background noise relative to the highest signal intensity in a probe quartet (Figure 1, grey inset) was used to compare the performance of static probes and isothermal probes. A Dscore close to 1 indicates high background noise and poor discrimination ability between probe signals, while a score close to 0 indicates low background noise and good discrimination ability.\nThe mean Dscore of the 5K SNP chips was plotted for static probe lengths (Figure 2a) and for probe melting temperature (Figure 2b). Statistical analysis with a one-way ANOVA indicates significant differences between mean\nDscore at various probe lengths (P < 0.0001),\nand a Tukey's multiple comparison test indicates that all probe lengths except 39- and\n41-mers have a significantly different mean Dscore (P < 0.05).\nOut of the nine tested probe lengths, 39-mer probes generated the lowest mean Dscore \nwith the best discrimination ability ( = 0.3575). A one-way ANOVA analysis indicates probe\nmelting temperature Dscore are significantly different from one another\n(P < 0.0001), and a Tukey's multiple comparison test indicates melting temperature in the\n66\u00b0C range was significantly different from other melting temperatures (P < 0.05).\nThe lowest mean Dscore with the best discrimination ability for probe\nmelting temperatures was generated at 66\u00b0C from the range of 42 to 82\u00b0C ( = 0.2647), and this outperformed any static probe lengths.

A useable base call was made at a SNP locus when the sense and antisense probesets indicated complementary bases; otherwise, there would be no base call for that SNP locus. Figure 3a depicts mean microarray accuracy plotted by Dscore; also depicted are CNV-SNP array data for the SNP subsets that are represented on SNP genotyping microarrays developed by the Broad Institute [21] and NIH [22]. The CNV-SNP array genotypes 1,507 of the 1,631 publicly available Broad Institute SNPs and 2,621 of the 2,743 publicly available NIH SNPs. For all SNP sets, a lower Dscore is associated with higher accuracy. SNPs from the Broad Institute and NIH maintain >95% accuracy at all Dscore cutoffs with 97.1% accuracy and 98.7% accuracy, respectively, at a Dscore cutoff of 1. The accuracy of all SNPs assayed on the CNV-SNP array maintain >95% accuracy for Dscore \u22640.9 but drops to an average accuracy of 94.6% at a Dscore of 1. Figure 3b depicts the mean number of base calls made by the microarray plotted by Dscore for all SNPs and for the SNP subsets from the Broad Institute and NIH microarray platforms (Figure 3b). On average, a microarray hybridization yielded 36,948 base calls from the 45,524 assayed SNP loci for a base call rate of 81.2%. The Broad Institute and NIH SNP subsets had an average call rate of 90.7% and 93.0%, respectively. Lower numbers of base calls are made at more stringent Dscore cutoffs for all data sets. When comparing accuracy for SNP subsets in exons, introns, and intergenic regions, introns and intergenic regions perform similarly, and exons exhibited the best performance (Table 1).",

In some cases, human DNA may constitute >90% of the total DNA extracted from infected blood samples and can hinder downstream uses of the parasite DNA for microarray hybridizations or sequencing. Nucleic acid blockers are commonly used in microarray hybridizations to prevent random probe binding to non-target nucleic acids and were tested on our microarray to prevent performance reduction in samples with significant amounts of human DNA contamination. We tested various nucleic acid blockers and found that 1\u00d7 Denhardt's solution provided the greatest number of base calls with no negative impact on CGH data when compared to hybridizations with bovine serum albumin, dimethyl sulfoxide, human Cot1 DNA, salmon sperm, and yeast tRNA. To test for the effect of human DNA contamination on our microarray, several DNA samples were extracted from Thailand-Burma patient blood samples or were whole genome amplified from patient blood. The amount of human DNA present in each sample was quantified, and 33 to 92% of the total DNA was found to be human, with WGA samples containing the most human DNA. WGA is generally, but not always, helpful as there is some variability in data generated from WGA samples. Using 250 ng of parasite DNA, field samples were hybridized to the microarray and examined for the number and accuracy of base calls (Figure 5b); accuracy was determined using Illumina sequences generated from the same samples (M Manske, unpublished observations). This platform is able to produce high quality data with samples containing extensive host DNA contamination equivalent to data from purified lab line DNA (Figure 5b).",

Through optimizations described here, the CNV-SNP array overcomes many hurdles associated with molecular work on P. falciparum field samples. Lower starting amounts of DNA are possible when using 65% AT random nonamers that compensate for the extreme AT bias of the genome. This optimization is especially useful for field sample DNA, which is typically scarce and difficult to obtain. It also eliminates the need for in vitro culture adaptation of field samples, which is typically used to generate enough DNA for applications like next-generation sequencing and is known to alter CNV and skew results of CNV analyses [29,30]. Using our modified protocol, the CNV-SNP array requires no more than 250 ng of starting parasite DNA with no compromise in data quality. Moreover, the ample yields of labeled DNA from 250 ng of starting parasite DNA indicate that the lower limit has not yet been defined, raising the possibility that finger prick blood samples on filter paper are accessible to this technology. In addition, the CNV-SNP array is robust to samples with high host DNA contamination (>90%) with no drop in data quality, making microarray-based genotyping complementary to higher resolution next-generation sequencing that is sensitive to human DNA contamination in field samples, often requiring sample preprocessing for target DNA enrichment. Notably, high human DNA contamination and low amounts of parasite DNA present serious challenges to genotyping the large number of samples necessary for genome-wide association studies.",

However, we suggest that the CNV-SNP array will continue to be useful as an 'everylab' tool alongside next-generation sequencing. Whole genome sequencing underpins the SNP discovery needed for chip design; in general, whole genome architecture and ultra-resolution mapping require fully sequenced and assembled genomes. The customizable microarray platform continues to improve in density (4.2 million element custom designs are anticipated in 2011) and offers unique configurations up to 12-plex of 135K probes, leading to a scenario in which a global set of SNPs identified by sequencing can be precisely represented on microarrays for regionally focused or hypothesis-driven designs. To date, microarrays remain cheaper, produce data more quickly, require less computational innovation, and are especially useful for processing large numbers of samples, while producing sufficient resolution and quality for genome-wide association studies and population genomic analysis. Furthermore, although progress is being made in scoring CNV using next-generation sequencing, that technology still lags behind the performance of microarray CGH.",

The high AT content of the P. falciparum genome is technically challenging for most molecular methods; however, the flexibility of the microarray platform described here allows users to customize and optimize microarrays to individual genomes through alterations of probe lengths, types, and numbers and adjustment of hybridization strategy. This process is applicable to population genomic studies in a wide range of organisms. Utilizing this flexibility, we created a custom high-density CNV-SNP array containing both resequencing probes capable of SNP genotyping and CGH probes for CNV detection. The CNV-SNP array is a reliable, accurate platform that allows simultaneous investigation of CNV and SNPs in a single hybridization. Its low cost, quick turn-around time, low DNA requirements, and resilience to human DNA contamination make it a valuable tool for population genomic studies.",

A NimbleGen resequencing probeset is composed of eight probes per SNP locus: four probes each for interrogation of sense and antisense strands. Each probe quartet is identical except for the central nucleotide that assays the nucleotide variant [27]. We downloaded 101,581 candidate SNP loci from PlasmoDB v5.5 [26] for parasite isolates HB3, Dd2, V1/S, 7G8, D10, FCC-2, K1, RO-33, D6, GHANA1, FCB, and IT. Common SNPs (SNPs identified in at least two parasite isolates) were blasted against the 3D7 genome to verify a unique 21-mer SNP typing probe sequence. Probesets with more than one exact match in the genome were discarded. Of the remaining candidate probesets, 5,347 SNP loci were randomly chosen for inclusion on the 5K SNP chip at nine different probe lengths: 21, 25, 29, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, and 45-mers. Hybridizations following NimbleGen standard CGH procedures [36] were performed using DNA from laboratory clones 3D7, HB3, Dd2, 7G8, and D10.",

Of the 101,581 candidate SNP loci downloaded from PlasmoDB and BLASTed for uniqueness, probesets for all SNPs reported in at least two parasites lines were included in the microarray. Some SNPs represented by a single isolate were included on the array and prioritized by mutation types sensitive to array detection [25].

Briefly, probes were tiled through the genome at 4-bp interval spacing and filtered for 60 to 80\u00b0C melting temperature and 50 to 75 bp length. The resulting probes were clustered with nearest neighbors and sorted to remove probes with extensive sequence identity to any other probe.

Parasite DNA from the Thailand-Burma border was collected from 5 ml whole blood of symptomatic patients visiting malaria clinics. Buffy coats from the blood samples were removed and infected red blood cells cultured for 24 h to allow ring stage parasites to mature to schizonts to provide more DNA. DNA was extracted using a standard phenol/chloroform protocol. Parasite isolates were screened for multiple infections and identical clones using seven polymorphic microsatellite markers: ARA2 (chr 11), POLY\u03b1 (chr 4), TA1 (chr 6), C2M1 (chr 2), C3M54 (chr 3), TA60 (chr 13), and C4M30 (chr 4). These markers were amplified using fluorescent end-labeled oligos and run on an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and alleles scored using GeneScan (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and Genotyper (Applied Biosystems Inc.) software. Samples were considered multiple clone infections if one or more of the seven microsatellite loci showed multiple alleles. Only unique genotypes were included in the study. Thailand-Burma samples with an inadequate amount of DNA were whole genome amplified using phi29 DNA polymerase (Fidelity Systems, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). WGA samples were cleaned using a standard phenol/chloroform protocol. Parasite DNA concentrations in the Thailand-Burma samples were measured using quantitative PCR. Patient samples were amplified using SYBRgreen (Applied Biosystems Inc.) with primers specific to the P. falciparum ama1 gene. Reactions were run on an ABI PRISM 7900HT realtime PCR machine and DNA amounts calculated by comparison with a dilution series of pure DNA from parasite line 3D7.

Base calls were made on resequencing probesets when the sense and antisense probes made complementary base calls. The discrimination score (Dscore) for each probe quartet was calculated as a background corrected ratio of the signal from the second greatest intensity probe from a probe quartet divided by the greatest intensity probe using custom perl scripts (Figure 1, grey insert): (Second highest signal intensity - Background)/(Highest signal intensity - Background). Background for each probe quartet was calculated as the average of the third and fourth highest signal intensities [32]. There is some noise inherent in this base calling method, which can be mitigated by performing technical replicates or incorporating probe replicates into the chip design. For SNP genotyping probes, probeset melting temperature was calculated as previously described [36] where mean melting temperature was calculated from all probes in each probe quartet. The accuracy of the base calls made by the resequencing probes was calculated as the percentage of base calls that matched the reference genome for 3D7 or draft genome assemblies for HB3, Dd2, SC05, and 7C126 [20,28,41]. To ascertain the base called at a SNP locus in the genome assembly, resequencing probes were mapped to draft genome assemblies using blastall, requiring at least 95% of the probe length with less than four mismatched/indel positions excluding the central nucleotide. Illumina sequence data were aligned to the 3D7 reference genome with SNP-o-matic software [42] to identify SNP locations for comparison to microarray data.",
