Studies have indicated that lncRNAs play critical roles in many important biological processes such as chromatin modification1, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation2, 3, and human diseases4, 5. Relating proteins with Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a tremendous and meaningful task in human health with applications in understanding lncRNA mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy6, 7. In general, lncRNAs exert functions by interfacing with corresponding RNA-binding proteins. Thus, identifying lncRNA interacted proteins is significant to understand complex functions of lncRNA and molecular mechanism8, 9 of disease progression and cellular circuitry10, 11.",

They trained Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers using 3-mer and 4-mer conjoint triad features for amino acid and nucleotide sequences, respectively14. Bellucci et al. created a method named catRAPID15 by exploiting the physicochemical properties including secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals propensities. Wang et al. proposed an approach based on Na\u00edve Bayes (NB) and Extended NB (ENB) classifiers using the similar data and features supported in Muppirala et al.\u2019s work16. In 2013, IncPro17 was created by Lu et al. using three types of classical protein secondary structures, hydrogen-bond and Van der Waals propensities, and six types of RNA secondary structures (RSS).",

            "text": "Nevertheless, all of these methods only focus on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological networks associated with lncRNAs. On the other hand, biological network-based methods was already widely used in many types of studies, such as disease gene prioritization18 and drug-target interaction prediction and some of them have achieved good performances. One of the most commonly used approach is guilt-by-association (GBA)19, which provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. New emerged methods, including the Katz method20, Combining dATa Across species using Positive-Unlabeled Learning Techniques(CATAPULT)19, Random Walk with Restart (RWR)21, and LncRNA-protein Interaction prediction based on Heterogeneous Network model (LPIHN)22, have extended the association from just direct protein interactions to more distant connections in various ways. The KATZ measure20 is a weighted sum of the number of paths in the network that measures the similarity of two nodes. CATAPULT19 is a supervised machine learning method that uses a biased support vector machine where the features are derived from walks in a heterogeneous gene-trait network. RWR21 is a method for prioritization of candidate genes by use of a global network distance measure, random walk analysis, for definition of similarities in protein-protein interaction networks and it add weight to the assumption that phenotypically similar diseases are associated with disturbances of subnetworks within the larger protein interactome that extend beyond the disease proteins themselves. LPIHN22 is a network-based method by implement a random walk on a heterogeneous network. PRINCE is a global method based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information. Compared with LPIHN and RWR, PRINCE propagates information in a smaller network but contains more connotative meaning when build the initial probability values and has made great performance in gene prioritization23 and disease identification24.",

In this paper, we adopt a method named HeteSim, which is a path-based measure to calculate the relevance between objects in heterogeneous network25. The basic idea is that similar objects are more likely to be related to some other objects. Considering the relatedness of heterogeneous objects is path-constrained, HeteSim gives a uniform and symmetric measure for arbitrary paths to evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous object pair (same or different types) with one single score. Due to the relevance path not only captures the semantics information but also constrains the walk path, the score is also a path-based similarity measure.",

Only a small number of lncRNA-protein interactions have been well-characterized. Computational methods can be helpful in suggesting potential interactions for possible experimentation25. In this study, we use HeteSim measure to calculate the relevance between lncRNA and protein in a heterogeneous network. The importance of inferring novel lncRNA-protein interactions by considering the subtle semantic meanings of different paths in the heterogeneous network have been verified39. We first construct a heterogeneous network consisting of a lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, a lncRNA-protein association network and a protein-protein interaction network. Then, we use the HeteSim measure to calculate a score for each lncRNA-protein pairs in each path. Finally, a SVM classifier is used to combine the scores of different paths and making predictions. We compare the proposed PLPIHS with PRINCE, RWR and LPIHN and find that PLPIHS obtain an AUC score of 0.9679 in 0.3 network, which is significantly higher than PRINCE, RWR and LPIHN (0.813, 0.884 and 0.7918, respectively). We also compare the performance of these four methods in networks of different connectivity density. As a result, PLPIHS outperforms the other method across all the networks. Moreover, when analysing the predicted proteins interacted with lncRNA MALAT1, PLPIHS successfully predicts 63 out of 68 associations, while PRINCE, RWR and LPIHN retrieve much lower interactions of 57, 57 and 53, respectively. And the top-ranked lncRNA-protein interactions predicted by our method are supported by existing literatures. The results highlight the advantages of our proposed method in predicting possible lncRNA-protein interactions.",

To obtain genome-wide lncRNA and protein-coding gene associations, we combine three sources of data:Co-expression data from COXPRESdb40. Three preprocessed co-expression datasets (Hsa.c4-1, Hsa2.c2-0 and Hsa3.c1-0) including pre-calculated pairwise Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients for human were collected from COXPRESdb.

For instance, a lncRNA and a protein is connected via \u2018lncRNA-lncRNA-protein\u2019 path or \u2018lncRNA-protein-protein\u2019 path representing totally different meanings. The former means that if a lncRNA is associated with a protein, then another lncRNA similar to the lncRNA will be potential associated with the protein. The latter shows that if a protein associated with a lncRNA, then another protein interacted with the protein will be likely associated with the lncRNA. Therefore, the potential information hidden in each path is extraordinary essential to be taken into account during prediction.",

            "text": "The PLPIHS framework is illustrated in Fig. 2. Firstly, we construct a heterogeneous network consisting of a lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, a lncRNA-protein association network and a protein-protein interaction network. Three kinds of sparse networks are obtained from the heterogeneous network under different cutoff value 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 (see lncRNA-Protein associations). The larger cutoff is, the network is more sparse. A total of 15941 lncRNAs genes and 20284 protein-coding genes are extracted as presented in Section 2.3. We randomly take out 1511 lncRNAs and 344 proteins to construct a smaller network for the following experiments in consideration of computing costs. The construction of the smaller heterogeneous networks under different cutoff values are shown in Table 4, where \u2018lnc2lnc\u2019 denotes the lncRNA-lncRNA network, \u2018lnc2code\u2019 denotes the lncRNA-protein network and \u2018code2code\u2019 denotes the protein-lncRNA network. For example, there are 25,469 interactions in the lncRNA-protein network under the cutoff if 0.3. Then, we randomly select 2000 lncRNA-protein pairs as positive examples from the 0.9 network and the same number of interaction pairs as negative examples from the 0.3 network. The paths with length less than six transferred from a lncRNA to a protein among the heterogeneous network are listed in Table 1. We use id to indicate the path combination, i.e., 1\u2032~2\u2032 represents path \u2018LLP\u2019 and path \u2018LPP\u2019. Next, we calculate the heteSim score for each lncRNA-protein pair under each path. The results of different paths are used as different features. And we combine a constant factor \u03b2 to inhibit the influence of longer paths.The longer the path length is, the smaller the inhibiting factor is. Finally, a SVM classifier is built with these scores to predict potential lncRNA-protein associations. On the account of the HeteSim measure is based on the path-based relevance framework39, it can effectively dig out the subtle semantics of each paths.\n",
