            "text": "miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules and may regulate gene expression at post-transcription level (Bartel, 2009). Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in cell apoptosis (Wilson & Doudna, 2013). miR-29b effectively inhibits apoptosis via directly targeting caspase-7 and nuclear apoptosis inducing factor 1 (NAIF1) in Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Fu et al., 2014). miR-27b promotes doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) (Mu et al., 2015). Moreover, miR-27b is an endogenous inhibitory factor of apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) expression and decreases the apoptotic rate of neurons(Chen et al., 2014). miRNAs are also involved in regulating the process of virus-induced apoptosis (Smith et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). Hs_154 promotes WNV-mediated apoptosis via inhibiting the expression of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Smith et al., 2012). Our previous studies showed that miR-27b was significantly down-regulated during TGEV-induced apoptosis (Song et al., 2015). Thus, we supposed that miR-27b may play a role in apoptosis induced by TGEV infection. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-27b in TGEV-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells and demonstrated that the miR-27b attenuated TGEV-induced apoptosis by targeting RUNX1, suggesting TGEV may use miR-27b to regulate apoptosis in PK-15 cells.",

The apoptotic rate was analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 and 48 hpi. The results showed that the over-expression of miR-27b led to a decrease of apoptotic rate and the down-expression of miR-27b increased apoptotic rate at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 1A), indicating that miR-27b attenuated apoptosis induced by TGEV infection in PK-15 cells. We previously found that TGEV infection could cause PK-15 cell apoptosis through mitochondria-mediated pathway and FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway (Ding et al., 2012). Therefore, we analyzed caspase-9 activity of mitochondria-mediated pathway and caspase-8 activity of FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway. However, miR-27b did not affect the caspase-8 activity during TGEV infection (data not shown). As expected, the caspase-9 activity was decreased by miR-27b mimics and up-regulated by miR-27b inhibitors in the TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we investigated the effect of miR-27b on caspases-3 activity in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. The caspase-3 activity was decreased by miR-27b mimics and increased by miR-27b inhibitors in the TGEV-infected cells compared with control (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-27b plays a negative role in the TGEV-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells via mitochondria-mediated pathway.",

Moreover, RUNX1 was reported to regulate apoptosis (Wu et al., 2012). Thus, we investigated the direct interaction between miR-27b and 3\u2032 UTR of RUNX1 mRNA through dual-luciferase assay. The sequence of the 3\u2032 UTR of RUNX1 was obtained by PCR and the two binding sites of miR-27b seed region in the 3\u2032 UTR of RUNX1 were mutated with a 3-bp substitution. The 3\u2032 UTR of RUNX1 and its mutational version were respectively sub-cloned into the 3\u2032 UTR of the Renilla luciferase dual-luciferase plasmid psiCHECK-2 (Figs. 2A and 2B). The constructs were co-transfected into PK-15 cells with miR-27b mimics (or negative control) or miR-27b inhibitors (or negative control). Compared with the miRNA mimics control, introduction of miR-27b mimics decreased the RUNX1-WT reporter activity (Fig. 2C). To determine whether miR-27b inhibits RUNX1 expression, miR-27b mimics or miRNA mimics control were transfected into PK-15 cells. RUNX1 expression was assessed by western blot. The result showed that miR-27b decreased expression of RUNX1 in PK-15 cells compared with the control (Fig. 2D). Together, our data conclusively demonstrate that RUNX1 is a direct target of miR-27b in PK-15 cells.",

We assessed the effects of miR-27b on the replication and transcription of TGEV genes and found that the replication and transcription of TGEV structural and non-structural genes were not affected by miR-27b (Data not shown). We tested the effects of miR-27b on apoptotic rate of TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. The results showed that miR-27b decreased TGEV-induced apoptosis. We previously reported that miR-27b was decreased by TGEV infection (Song et al., 2015), so we propose that miR-27b may present an antagonistic effect with TGEV infection on apoptosis via regulating mitochondrial pathway. An analogous situation has been reported that miR-27b alleviate hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis(Chen et al., 2014). It indicates that miR-27b not only down-regulates cancer cell apoptosis, it also suppresses virus-induced apoptosis.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is primarily modulated by two pathways, extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathway (mitochondrion-mediated), which regulate cell death involving the continuous activation of caspases (Lavrik, 2010). Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are factors of extrinsic pathway and mitochondrial pathway respectively (Sakamaki et al., 2015; Thornberry & Lazebnik, 1998). Bax, a member of the BCL-2 family, functions as an apoptotic activator to activate caspase-9 and -3 (Chipuk et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2012). In this study, we showed that miR-27b inhibited Bax expression and reduced the activities of caspase-9 and -3 during TGEV-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated that miR-27b regulated apoptosis via down-regulation the expression of Bax and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, implying that miR-27b are involved in regulating TGEV-induced apoptosis via regulating mitochondrial pathway.",

The imprecise binding make each miRNA has the ability to target multiple mRNAs. For example, miR-27b could suppress adipogenesis in hMADS cells by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) (Karbiener et al., 2009) and promote differentiation of myeloblasts through targeting RUNX1 (Feng et al., 2009). In the present study, we confirmed that RUNX1 is the target of miR-27b during TGEV infection, while whether miR-27b regulates apoptosis via RUNX1 is unclear. RUNX1 is a transcription factor, and play important roles in regulating the growth, development, and/or differentiation of multiple lineages of haematopoietic cells (Feng et al., 2009). We found over-expression of RUNX1 reduced Bax and decreased the activities of caspase-9 and -3, and silencing RUNX1 up-regulated Bax and increased the activities of caspase-9 and -3. This suggests that miR-27b regulates TGEV-induced apoptosis via targeting RUNX1, which is an important supplement of RUNX1 function.",
