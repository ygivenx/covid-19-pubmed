Acute respiratory infection is a major cause of child mortality in Bangladesh, accounting for 21% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years from 2000 to 2004 [7]. When pandemic influenza A (H1N1) occurred in Bangladesh in 2009, there was concern for its potential to rapidly spread due to the high population density and lack of respiratory hygiene. To contain or reduce transmission of viruses such as pandemic influenza the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions and public health messages on maintenance of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette [8]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified certain respiratory hygiene measures, including: covering the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing; using tissues to contain respiratory secretions; disposal of used tissues in the nearest waste receptacle; and washing hands with soap after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects. CDC recommended that if persons do not have a tissue, they should cough or sneeze into their upper sleeve, not into their hands, to stop the spread of germs [1,6]. Nevertheless, a recently conducted quantitative study in a rural and an urban site in Bangladesh found that very few people in these areas currently practice respiratory hygiene. Of the 1,122 observed coughing and sneezing events, 907 (81%) people coughed or sneezed into the air, 119 (11%) into their hands and 83 (7%) into their clothing [9].",

            "text": "To design an effective intervention to improve respiratory hygiene in a community, it is important to understand the community's perceptions on respiratory infections and their perceived barriers to practice respiratory hygiene. Finding ways to communicate health messages that could prevent respiratory infections is difficult for several reasons: respiratory diseases tend to have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, e. g. coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing; symptoms of respiratory infections exist on a continuum from mild to severe; people perceive respiratory illnesses as \"mild\" events even among those who have severe signs and symptoms; some symptoms are related to non-infectious illnesses such as asthma or allergies; some respiratory viruses are spread through the air and thus not easily traced [10-13]. The inability to recognize the severity or understand transmission patterns of respiratory illness is a concern because when viral respiratory infections occurs within a community people may not respond or may take ineffective actions to reduce person-to-person spread of the viruses. For example, they might try to avoid being exposed to cold weather or water rather than avoiding persons with respiratory symptoms. Improved respiratory hygiene, such as coughing or sneezing into the upper sleeve, could reduce the risk of respiratory illness, especially in densely populated countries like Bangladesh, because both crowding and poor ventilation facilitate respiratory infections spread quickly from person to person [3]. In low-income countries like Bangladesh, disposable tissues are considered a luxury and not commonly used.",

We hypothesized that persons in the community share traditional beliefs, culture, social norms and perceived risk of illness about the transmission of respiratory infections that may not compatible with germ theory. These determinants are important to address in a successful respiratory hygiene intervention. Our formative qualitative research study examined the above hypothesis and this paper reports our findings about community perceptions on respiratory infections, why they occur, how they are spread, and the preventive measures that people take to protect themselves and their families. We collected these data to facilitate the development of appropriate behavior change interventions to interrupt respiratory disease transmission.",

The groups included adult males, adult females, school boys, school girls, male teachers, female teachers, paramedics and religious leaders. Eight to 11 people participated in each focus group discussion. Selecting focus group discussion participants, to ensure that there was no overlap with the in-depth interview informants within the same geographic area, we started the selection process where the in-depth interview sampling had ended. We then enrolled adult male and female informants from the next 10th households. We prepared a list of all schools situated within or contiguous to both study sites and randomly selected two schools from each site; we selected male and female students of level three to five from one school and male and female teachers from the other.

During in-depth interviews, lasting from 35 min to 60 min, and focus group discussions, ranging from 55 min to 90 min, we used an interview guide that started by asking people to list all of the illnesses they could think of that they associated with respiratory functions. We also asked about their perceptions on causes of respiratory illness, how respiratory infections are passed from one person to another, how disease transmission can be prevented, existing social norms, current practices related to respiratory hygiene, and for suggestions of messages and channels to promote respiratory hygiene behavior. We also conducted unstructured observations in markets to see respiratory hygiene practices in public places. During observation, we took notes about customers' and shopkeepers' behaviors linked to respiratory hygiene (Appendix 3). Nevertheless we did not count the events as we conducted unstructured observations in extremely crowded market places. Rather than quantify, we were more interested in observing people's actual respiratory hygiene practices including: whether people covered their mouths during coughing or sneezing; if so, how they covered their mouths (with hands/upper arm/cloth); whether they turned away from others while coughing or sneezing; whether they spat on the ground; and whether they washed their hands after nasal cleaning or coughing or sneezing into hands.",
