We found that the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in all HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were reduced by HBV infection. No significant difference in the expression of Tyk2, JAK1, STAT1, and STAT2 was detected among any of the HBV-infected cells (Figure 4a). After HBV infection, the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were lower than those in HepG2 cells, and the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 TMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2 cells (Figure 4a). In addition, the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2.2.15 cells following HBV infection (Figure 4a).

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that multiple signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, Smad7-TGF-\u03b2, REB/PKA, and JAK\u2013STAT, are involved in the pathogenesis of HBV infection.6, 10, 11, 12 Among these signaling pathways, the JAK\u2013STAT pathway is involved in the anti-HBV activity of IFN. In addition, HBV and HBV antigens can regulate the expression of JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway molecules and antiviral proteins in hepatocellular models in vitro. Furthermore, the reduced STAT1 methylation and subsequent increased STAT1\u2013PIAS1 interaction contributed to the antagonistic activity of IFN-alpha against HBV.6 Therefore, we examined whether the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway was involved in the inhibitory effect of TMEM2 on HBV infection. First, we investigated whether TMEM2 could regulate the expression of the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. Our results showed that TMEM2 overexpression activated the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway and TMEM2 knockdown decreased the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, suggesting that TMEM2 regulates the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. This finding was further supported by the expression levels of MxA and OAS1, two downstream molecules in the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. IFN has been shown to activate the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. We observed that IFN treatment increased the expression of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, and this effect was compromised by reduced TMEM2 expression, leading to attenuated inhibitory effects of IFN on HBV production. Furthermore, we explored whether blocking the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway could abolish the anti-HBV effects of TMEM2. Our data revealed that pre-treatment with JAK1 inhibitor resulted in elevated levels of HBsAg, HBcAg, HBV DNA, and HBV cccDNA in TMEM2-overexpressing HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 8, TMEM2 caused an increase in the translocation of IRF9 into nuclei, but no effect on IRF9 expression was detected. The increased levels of nuclear IRF9 enhanced the expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of ISRE motifs. Given that TMEM2 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and promoted the translocation of IRF9 into nuclei, it would be interesting to determine whether TMEM2 is involved in the formation of the ISGF3 complex, a key player in type 1 interferon signaling. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors that mediate the transcriptional regulation of interferon genes and IFN-inducible genes.13 IRF9 is an immunomodulatory transcription factor that is important for the response to IFN-\u03b1 downstream of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.14, 15",

Our previous in vivo study confirmed that NTCP is the receptor of HBV and demonstrated that the NTCP mutation (p.Ser267Phe) was associated with a reduced prevalence of acute and chronic liver failure.22 In particular, we identified five cases of the p.Ser267Phe homozygous mutation among 1899 patients with chronic HBV infection. Given that five homozygous patients were infected with HBV, we speculate that there is more than one route of HBV cellular entry. Characterization of the biological functions of TMEM2 is useful to understand the mechanism of HBV infection. It is not clear whether TMEM2 is a HBV receptor involved in HBV infection through the G8 and GG domains. In addition, the role of TMEM2 in HBV infection should be investigated in vivo. Whether the structure of TMEM2 is altered during HBV infection and whether TMEM2 interacts with NTCP should be investigated in future investigations.",

The level of IRF9 in the nuclei of HepG2 shTMEM2 cells did not change significantly in response to HBV infection compared with that in HepG2 GFP cells. In contrast, the level of IRF9 in the nuclei of non-HBV-infected HepG2 TMEM2 cells was remarkably higher than that in non-HBV-infected HepG2 GFP and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells. HBV infection reduced the level of IRF9 in the nuclei in HepG2 TMEM2 cells. Similar results were observed in HepG2.2.15 cells, which overexpressed TMEM2; nuclear translocation is represented by column shown on the right side of Figure 5a. (b) Using a plasmid that expresses a reporter gene (firefly luciferase) under the control of a promoter containing ISRE motifs, we showed that transfection of this plasmid into HepG2 TMEM2 cells, either with HBV infection or without, significantly increased luciferase activity compared with HepG2 GFP and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells (*P<0.05 compared with HepG2 GFP cells without HBV infection; #P<0.05 compared with HepG2 GFP cells with HBV infection).
