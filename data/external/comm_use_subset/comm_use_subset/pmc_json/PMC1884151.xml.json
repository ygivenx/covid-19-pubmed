According to a rigorous descriptive review [2], historical descriptions of the incubation period can be traced back to the mid-16th century when Girolamo Fracastoro (Fracastorius) (1478\u20131553), an Italian physician, documented for the first time the incubation period of rabies in 1546 [3]. The incubation period of infectious diseases ranges from the order of a few hours, which is common for toxic food poisoning, to a few decades as seen in the case of tuberculosis, AIDS and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Since symptom onset reflects pathogen growth and invasion, excretion of toxins and initiation of host-defense mechanisms, the length of the incubation period varies largely according to the replication rate of the pathogen, the mechanism of disease development, the route of infection and other underlying factors.",

Whereas the incubation and symptomatic periods are distinguished by symptom onset, other epidemiologic terms are distinguished by acquisition of infectiousness. That is, the time from infection to acquisition of infectiousness is referred to as the latent period, which is subsequently followed by the infectious period [4]. These two concepts are clearly separated by definition and are not directly related. The incubation period of infectious diseases offers various insights into clinical and public health practices, as well as being important for epidemiologic and ecological studies.",

Previous classic works on models of incubation period are discussed, including the earliest method to estimate the incubation period using incomplete data, the earliest attempt to model the distribution, and estimations of the time of exposure during an outbreak with a common harmful influence and a very brief time of exposure (i.e., a point source outbreak).",

Moreover, during an outbreak of a newly emerged directly transmitted disease, the incubation period distribution permits determination of the length of quarantine required for a potentially exposed individual (i.e., by restricting movement of an exposed individual for a duration sufficiently longer than the incubation period) [10]. Further, if the time lag between acquiring infectiousness and symptom onset appears long (i.e., if the incubation period is relatively long compared to the latent period), it implies that isolation measures (e.g, restriction of movement until the infectious individual loses infectiousness) are likely to be ineffective, complicating disease control [1,11].",

The distribution is also useful in statistical approaches of epidemic curve reconstruction and short-term predictions of slowly progressing diseases; the backcalculation method uses the incubation period to estimate HIV prevalence and project the future incidence of AIDS [14,15]. During the last decade, this method has also been extended to prion diseases such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) [16,17], vCJD [18-22] and Kuru [23]. Although backcalculation is not discussed in this paper, several rigorous reviews have been published with regard to diseases with a long incubation period [15,17,22,28]. This approach has also recently diverged to quantification of the transmission potential of diseases with an acute course of illness [24] and infectiousness relative to disease-age [25]. Moreover, in cases such as the short and long incubation periods of Plasmodium vivax malaria in temperate zones, the incubation period also enhances ecological understanding of adaptation strategies; in temperate zones, clearly separate bimodal peaks with approximate lengths of 2 and 50 weeks are observed [26,27], helping malaria transmissions continue over the winter season when transmission is usually greatly reduced due to seasonal entomologic characteristics.",

Thus, it is often difficult to determine the incubation period without explicit information of the time of exposure. The majority of epidemiologic data informs us that exposure (i.e., infection) occurred in a defined period, data of which is referred to as interval censored [29]. This is a common concern for acute infectious diseases transmitted by droplets and droplet nuclei and, most noteworthily, was discussed in detail during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [30,31]. Previous studies on the population dynamics of influenza tend to make assumptions with regard to the incubation period distribution without employing observed data [32,33], perhaps mainly due to difficulties in identifying the time of exposure. The incubation period distribution of influenza remained almost unknown until a recent study reanalyzed the data of influenza transmission on an aircraft with a short duration of flight [34,35]. Assuming Weibull distribution, this study estimated the mean (and standard deviation (SD)) incubation period as 1.48 (0.47) days [35]. Not only was the sample size of the estimate limited (i.e., 37 secondary cases), but since no other estimates are currently available, the present paper revisits a historical study on this topic.",

Whereas Dr. McKendrick, in collaboration with William Ogilvy Kermack (1898\u20131970) [40,41], is relatively well known as the first to suggest the deterministic epidemic model given by differential equations, his analysis of the incubation period of Spanish flu preceded this, and remains relatively unknown even among specialists (see Online Additional File 1 for the original). Except for this work, no other historical study on influenza has explicitly accounted for the unknown time of exposure or identified the time of exposure in a specific setting (as in the above mentioned study documenting transmission on an aircraft [34,35]).",

The incidence was recorded according to the date of voyage after departure. The original epidemiologic data was based on observations of 92 departing voyages, summarized by Dr. John Howard Lidgett Cumpston (1880\u20131954), Director of Quarantine of the Commonwealth of Australia [42] (the original material is available online [43]). In this dataset, onset of 64, 17, 5 and 2 cases was observed on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th day of voyage, i.e., after departure, on the documented ships (Figure 1). No influenza case developed symptoms on or after the 5th day of voyage and the observed cases were thought to have been exposed to influenza before departure. Since the data for each voyage mainly included only a few initial cases that developed influenza on board, it is assumed that potential secondary transmission on board was negligible, and potential asymptomatic transmission was also ignored (detailed information on the observed and excluded secondary transmissions are documented in the original [43] and Dr. McKendrick also addressed the issue of secondary transmission by limiting the number of cases per ship). Further technical details are given in the Additional File 2.",

From this, Dr. McKendrick suggested that the mean incubation period was 32.71 hours, which is consistent with recent estimate [35]. However, this value was likely slightly underestimated, because the model implicitly assumed the possible time of exposure as being from time 0 to infinite before departure; it has been extensively discussed that data assuming long possible periods of exposure is likely to be uninformative. Moreover, in a recent work on SARS concerned with analysis of data with short periods of exposure [44], the equal probability of exposure for each possible date was likely to have overestimated the variance of the incubation period distribution [31]. Thus, to obtain a precise estimate of the incubation period, appropriate censoring methods with well-defined short periods of exposure are needed in addition to a large sample size [30,45]. However, despite these technical concerns, it is remarkable that Dr. McKendrick was able to estimate the incubation period of pandemic influenza considering the unknown time of exposure in the given data.",

Dr. Miner collected epidemic records of several outbreaks of typhoid fever, claiming that the length of the incubation period clearly differs by source of infection (i.e., comparing water- and food-borne outbreaks, he found that the food-borne outbreaks had a much shorter incubation period, most likely reflecting dose-response phenomena). During his analysis, Dr. Miner paid close attention to variance in the incubation period, describing a distribution that always skewed to the right. In calculating \"moments\" of the incubation period in a water-borne outbreak at the Old Salem Chautauqua, 1916, he used the following equation to explain the epidemic curve:",

Among Pearson's curves, type I distribution is the most standard and relatively flexible, and can realize right-skewed distribution [47].

Since recall bias is unavoidable in retrospective epidemiologic studies of food poisoning requiring huge efforts of food traceback [61], this method appears to be very useful in determining the most plausible time of exposure and narrowing down the amount of information to be traced.

Dr. Horiuchi examined the validity and precision of Dr. Hirayama's method using Monte Carlo simulations, claiming that the method could be improved further [71] and suggesting that the incubation period should be assumed to follow \"non-central\" lognormal distribution when an epidemic curve is used [64]. That is, although Dr. Hirayama used the distance from the time of exposure to the median (x in eqn. (6)), this is unknown information in field observations, and thus, Dr. Horiuchi and his colleagues suggested the use of x-C, where C is the time of exposure. This permitted the more convenient use of calendar time. For example, let X be a random variable following non-central lognormal distribution, ln(X-C) should follow a normal distribution, N(\u03bc, \u03c3 2), and consequently, the following t becomes a linear function of ln(X-C):",

Estimation of the time of exposure using similar assumptions was extensively discussed in Japan during the 1950s and 60s. These discussions included the following: (i) the definition of the incubation period (e.g., which to use as the time of onset during a food-borne outbreak, the onset of diarrhea or fever? [72,73]), (ii) extension of the estimation method when the data is truncated [68], (iii) the influence of host- and pathogen-related factors and routes of infection on the incubation period [74], and (iv) outbreaks that include cases resulting from human-to-human secondary transmissions (e.g., shigellosis [75]).",

Indeed, it has been pointed out that the estimates obtained using the methods of Drs. Sartwell and Hirayama largely depend on optional percentile points, \u03b1 [76], while that proposed by Dr. Horiuchi and his colleagues is also thought to be highly sensitive to an optional value, h [77]. Thus, estimates of the time of exposure should be addressed statistically by precise solution of the three-parameter lognormal distribution [78,79]. Accordingly, in line with this, the maximum likelihood method was proposed [77,80,81]. Although Dr. Hill was the first to document the application of the maximum likelihood method [80], it unfortunately remained relatively unknown, especially among Japanese epidemiologists, until Toshiro Tango, a statistician at the National Institute of Public Health, Japan, attempted to propagate the method and propose reasonable estimators during the 1990s [77,81]. Let \u03b3 be the time of exposure, the pdf of the three-parameter lognormal distribution is given by:",

The fundamental biological reason to assume lognormal distribution is related to an inoculation study of ectromelia virus (mouse pox) [83], which suggested exponential growth of pathogens within the host during the initial phase. Another similar study suggested that a fixed threshold likely exists when the host response is observed [84]. Based on these findings, pathogen growth in inoculation experiments was modeled using the birth-death process, supporting right skewed distribution of the incubation period and its long tail [85-87]. Also, given similar results from further birth-death process models [76,88] and another previous model [89], what we have learnt to date can be described as follows: if the growth rate of a microorganism is implicitly assumed to follow normal distribution, and if there is a fixed threshold of pathogen load at which symptoms are revealed due to the host response, exponential growth of microorganisms should result in an incubation period sufficiently approximated by lognormal distribution.",

Through such efforts, the validity of the lognormal assumption has been supported by the accumulated experience of Dr. Sartwell and the above mentioned Japanese epidemiologists. It may also be true that the lognormal distribution was preferred because of its statistical usefulness (as described in the above Japanese study). However, the host-defense mechanism, which is almost entirely responsible for symptom onset, was later shown to be far more complex than previously expected. For example, fever is induced by very complex reactions and by several factors including circulating cytokines such as interluekin-2 [92]. Thus, whereas lognormal distribution may be applied to the incubation periods of many acute infectious diseases, it is necessary to bear in mind that the assumption is supported only by previous experience.",

As discussed above, Weibull distribution with a threshold (i.e., three parameter Weibull distribution) was assumed for the incubation period of influenza [35]. Such study indicates that a simple lognormal assumption does not always hold in practice. Other studies have assumed gamma distribution for the incubation periods of SARS and smallpox [24,30,93-95], and regarding the latter, lognormal distribution has also been assumed [25,96]. Figure 5 compares the quantile plots of lognormal and gamma distribution for the incubation period of smallpox, showing that both fit almost equally well with the observed data. For both distributions, the \u03c72 goodness-of-fit test revealed no significant deviation between the observed and predicted values (\u03c7212 = 11.6, p = 0.48 and \u03c7212 = 16.8, p = 0.16 for lognormal and gamma distributions, respectively). However, two-parameter Weibull distribution did not represent well the probability density functions of the incubation period (p < 0.001). These discussions imply that comparisons using different distributions are needed; it is important to at least compare the goodness-of-fit of different and arbitrarily chosen distributions for acute infectious diseases.",

One important reason for this is that the mechanisms of disease development for AIDS and prion diseases, for example, are far more complicated than those of acute infectious diseases. In the case of AIDS, where Weibull distribution is frequently assumed for the incubation period [15], symptom onset is induced by immunodeficiency resulting from HIV infection followed by various opportunistic infections. For BSE and vCJD, various distributions have been assumed for the backcalculation, permitting some uncertainty analyses [19,20,22,97]. Although the disease mechanisms of vCJD are yet to be clarified, considering within-host dynamics it is evident that the incubation period cannot be explained by the above simple explanation [98,99]. That is, for these diseases, the above mentioned explanation for the lognormal assumption is not justified, and thus, the choice of distribution for the incubation period needs to be carefully assessed using sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Indeed, various right skewed distributions are often used in sensitivity analysis, revealing whether or not the final results depend on the arbitrarily chosen standard distribution for the incubation period [19,20,97].",

Second, the biological validity of assuming specific distributions for the incubation period remains an open question [100,101], and thus, further information is needed. For example, within-host dynamics would help clarify disease onset mechanisms in the most explicit way [102]. Moreover, if information associated with within-host dynamics is not available, an accumulation of distributions obtained using different datasets would be of interest, as would examination of various characteristic factors (e.g., dose-response mechanisms [6,7,9], and variable susceptibility due to age, race and genetic factors (for example, see [45,94])).",

In particular, the following were highlighted: (i) the earliest modeling effort conducted using incomplete data of a pandemic influenza, (ii) the explicit distribution of the incubation period, (iii) the application of a lognormal assumption to estimations of the time of exposure during a point source outbreak, and (iv) the validity of assuming lognormal distribution for the incubation period. Although it was not highlighted in the present paper, Norman T. J. Bailey also formed a framework using a chain binomial model, which is useful for household transmission data [103,104]. This method estimates the incubation period as the sum of the mean latent period, which follows normal distribution, and a further fixed infectious period; however, the estimated period does not precisely imply the incubation period, but rather is closer to what is presently referred to as the serial interval [48,105]. That is, the incubation period that can be extracted from household transmission data remains to be clarified.",

            "text": "The lessons that can be learnt from the presented discussion are as follows: (I) although it is historically remarkable that the incubation period of pandemic influenza was assessed based on an explicit understanding of an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure were too long and equal probability of exposure was assumed for each possible date. Well-defined short periods of exposure are needed to decipher the incubation period distribution using appropriate statistical methods. Taking this point into account will be critically important in estimating the incubation period of newly emerging diseases in the future. (II) The epidemiologic usefulness of the lognormal assumption was highlighted with respect to the basic characteristics of lognormal distribution, but this assumption is likely to remain unwarrantable until details of disease mechanisms are fully clarified; thus, this assumption may be merely an approximation of the right-skewed distribution. For example, considering the mechanisms of disease development, the lognormal assumption does not hold for HIV/AIDS and prion diseases. However, this limitation of the lognormal assumption does not imply that such approximation of the incubation period distribution is meaningless. Rather, it suggests that when parametric models are assumed, it is at least necessary to compare the goodness-of-fit for several distributions in order to overcome some of the uncertainty. Various datasets on the same disease would also help assess the uncertainty. Further, it would be informative if the determinants could be clarified even by simple stratifications (e.g., with respect to sex, age and genetic factors). Ideally, assumptions in the future should be supported by a detailed understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms provided by observations of within-host dynamics. Since the incubation period of infectious diseases is directly relevant to prevention and control, and because such knowledge can enhance our theoretical understanding of the spread of disease, further clarifications of the above points are deemed necessary.",
