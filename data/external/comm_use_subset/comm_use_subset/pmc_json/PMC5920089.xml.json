            "text": "Duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (genus Avihepatovirus, family Picornaviridae, DHAV-1) is one of the most common and lethal pathogens in young ducklings and is responsible for acute hepatitis, characterized by petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages of the liver surface1,2. The liver, a major site for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, plays a critical role in defending against invasive pathogens3,4. Immune responses in the liver appear to have evolved to balance virus eradication and immunopathology5. Major hepatotropic viruses, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), interact with innate immunity factors and induce both interferons (IFNs, types I and III) and antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and these viruses have developed multiple strategies to escape innate immune responses6\u201310. Inflammation is a double-edged sword that plays a vital role in liver metabolism. Moderate inflammatory responses confer a certain degree of protection, help repair damaged tissue, and promote steady-state reconstruction. However, uncontrolled inflammatory responses are present in most clinical cases of liver disease and may form a \u201cstorm\u201d that causes liver damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis and other adverse consequences11\u201313.",

However, small numbers of lymphocytes were found in the hepatic sinusoid at 24 hpi (Fig. 3B). At 36 hpi, hepatocytes were significantly infiltrated by large numbers of red blood cells, accompanied by steatosis, necrosis and hepatic lobule disappearance (Fig. 3C). Additionally, numerous lymphocytes infiltrated the hepatic sinusoid, and cell nuclei underwent pyknosis or karyolysis at 48 hpi (Fig. 3D). Moreover, we observed numerous apoptotic bodies (Fig. 3 black arrows) and a small number of lymphocytes (Fig. 3 white arrows). We also observed the proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells, accompanied by notable steatosis and concentrated cell nuclei (Fig. 3E).

Thus, ducks in the experimental groups were intramuscularly inoculated with 0.40 ml of the CH strain and 0.25 ml of the CH60 strain. Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue at 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hpi, and copy numbers were measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5, viral RNA of the CH strain increased to 2.51 \u00d7 108 copies/mg of tissue at 36 hpi, was sustained to 48 hpi, and then began to decrease at 60 hpi. Proliferation of the CH60 strain exhibited a similar phenomenon to that of the CH strain, and CH60 viral RNA peaked at 48 hpi, which was later than that for the CH strain.",

PRRs, such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), recognize viral RNA. Therefore, we measured the expression levels of these four PRRs in the liver. As shown in Fig. 6, the CH strain downregulated TLR3 and TLR7 during the early stage of infection (24 and 36 hpi); this downregulation was most obvious at 36 hpi. During the later stage of infection (60 hpi, 72 hpi), TLR3 and TLR7 expression gradually increased. Similar observations were made regarding the expression of MDA5 and RIG-I. Downregulation of these four PRRs may be related to viral escape mechanisms. The CH strain blocked the expression of host antiviral molecules by inhibiting the expression of PRRs to facilitate its own proliferation, as shown by characterizing viral replication (Fig. 5). Additionally, the CH60 strain up-regulated TLR7 within 36\u201372 hpi. Subsequently, we detected the expression of IPS-1, a key molecule downstream of MDA5 and RIG-I. IPS-1 was significantly up-regulated at 36\u201348 hpi with both CH and CH60 and exhibited some hysteresis compared with MDA5 and RIG-I expression, a trend that supported its involvement in host regulatory mechanisms.",

We determined the transcriptional levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, observing up-regulated IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 expression at 36 hpi followed by a peak at 48 hpi in the livers of CH-inoculated ducklings (Fig. 6). Similar results were found in blood samples from CH-inoculated ducklings (Fig. 6). Interestingly, IFN-\u03b2 expression in the livers of CH-inoculated ducklings was 133-fold higher at 48 hpi. Next, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) were assessed in the liver and blood samples. The expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 in the liver were significantly up-regulated after CH infection, peaked at 36 hpi and maintained the same levels until 48 hpi. However, IL-10 expression in the blood was downregulated before 48 hpi. The cytokine storm caused by IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in the livers of CH-inoculated ducklings was related to gross lesions (Fig. 2B\u2013C), microscopic pathological damage (Fig. 3B\u2013D) and apoptosis (Fig. 4B\u2013D). In CH60-inoculated ducklings, the expression of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 also changed. Remarkably, IFN-\u03b3 expression was up-regulated, but IL-10 expression showed no obvious changes, potentially indicating the engagement of adaptive immunity. Changes in IL-4 expression were similar to those observed for TNF-\u03b1. Specifically, both the CH and CH60 strains inhibited IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 expression during the early stage of infection, and both cytokines were up-regulated after 60 hpi.",

The CH strain caused nearly 50% mortality in ducklings and induced more efficient virus replication in the liver. Massive hemorrhages and necrotic lesions appeared on the liver surface with virus replication of the CH strain, which is consistent with previous reports in the literature2,19,20.

            "text": "The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens, which are recognized by PRRs. Picornaviruses are recognized by three classical PRRs: TLRs, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs)18. TLRs are transmembrane proteins that recognize viral components in extracellular and cytoplasmic vacuoles; TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA, while TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNA21,22. RLRs constitute a family of cytoplasmic proteins that includes RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. RIG-I binds to dsRNA or ssRNA bearing a 5\u2032 triphosphate, and MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA23,24. We evaluated the expression of TLR3, TLR7, MDA5, RIG-I and NLRP3 at 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hpi. The CH strain significantly inhibited these five PRRs. Therefore, we hypothesized that this phenomenon might be associated with immunological escape mechanisms of the DHAV-1 CH strain. The escape mechanisms of enterovirus25, which also belongs to the picornavirus family, have previously been elucidated. For example, the 2 A proteins of enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus B3 cleave MDA5, and the 3 C protein inhibits the expression of RIG-I26\u201328. According to Barral PM et al., poliovirus (PV) depends on caspases and proteasomes to reduce the expression of MDA5 after infecting cells, and PV may block type I IFN production by cleaving MDA529. As shown by Kotla S et al.30, PV blocks the activation of IRF-3 but does not inhibit MDA-5 or MAVS to inhibit IFN-I expression. However, the escape mechanisms of DHAV-1 have not been elucidated, and subsequent experiments using siRNA knockdown or poly I:C stimulation are required to further confirm the roles of PRRs in DHAV infection and specific escape mechanisms31. Expression of the PRRs TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I and NLRP-3 was depressed in the first 48 hours, while that of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 was elevated in the first 48 hpi. Interestingly, IPS-1 (also called MAVS) expression was elevated in the first 48 hours. In the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the RNA virus is first recognized by NOD2, and MAVS is then activated, resulting in the elevated expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. In addition, the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, which activates IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, can be activated via MAVS-dependent and independent mechanisms32. Therefore, DHAV-1 may elevate cytokine levels via the NOD-Like receptor signaling pathway.",

            "text": "A cytokine storm is an excessive immune response stimulated by viruses, bacteria and external factors. A severe cytokine storm produces markedly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFNs, interleukins, chemokines, and tumor necrosis factors, which are responsible for multi-organ dysfunction, via a specific feedback mechanism39\u201341. Cytokine storms were first discovered in graft-versus-host disease in 199342, and influenza virus, variola virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were all later found to cause severe cytokine storms43\u201345. However, there have been no reports investigating cytokine storms resulting from DHAV-1 infection. In our study, the IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 transcriptional levels were markedly up-regulated. Furthermore, the liver surface exhibited extensive punctate hemorrhaging, and the liver parenchyma was significantly infiltrated with numerous red blood cells, accompanied by steatosis and necrosis. Similar effects were not observed in CH60-inoculated ducklings, but cytokine storms have been identified in the adult duck kidney14 and liver46. Therefore, the pathological mechanisms induced by DHAV-1 are likely related to severe cytokine storms. IFN-\u03b3 is primarily secreted by Th1 cells and mononuclear macrophages, which are associated with cellular immunity. However, IL-10 is largely secreted by Th2 cells, which inhibit the proliferation and activation of Th1 cells, and monocyte macrophages, thus promoting the proliferation and activation of B lymphocytes and correlating with humoral immunity47. Notably, IL-10 was up-regulated after CH strain infection, but IFN-\u03b3 expression did not change significantly. The hyper-induction of IL-10 potentially inhibits IFN-\u03b3 expression and, in turn, inhibits cellular immunity rather than enhancing humoral immunity. Persistent inflammatory responses cause immune system dysfunction and ultimately cause liver damage.",
