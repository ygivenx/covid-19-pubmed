More than 70% of the adult cats entering the shelter were being euthanized. Local cat advocates discussed a program with the shelter manager, based on a 2008 Jacksonville, Florida, USA plan (Mitchell, 2008), to alter all healthy feral cats impounded at the shelter, and then return the cats to their place of capture, rather than euthanize them as healthy but unadoptable. This was viewed as a controversial program, as some groups believe feral cats are killing too many birds (Loss, Will & Marra, 2013), or live short, brutal lives (Jessup, 2004). The program began as a pilot in March 2010. Initially the program was called Feral Freedom, and is now referred to as Shelter Neuter Return (SNR).",

Feral and fractious cats experience extreme stress in the shelter environment, making all cats more susceptible to URI. \u201cBecause of its close association with herpesviral activation and stress, URI is also a bellwether for overall shelter cat health and wellbeing\u201d (UC Davis).",
