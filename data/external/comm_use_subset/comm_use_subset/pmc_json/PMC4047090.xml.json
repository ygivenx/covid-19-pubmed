This disease was first described as \u201cmystery swine disease\u201d in the United states in 1987 [3], which is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disorders in all age of pigs [3], [4]. In 2006, atypical PRRS outbreak caused a dramatic decline of pig breeding stock amount and huge economic losses to pig production in China [5]. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the causative agent of this disease, is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus, which belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus\n[6], [7]. The viral genome is approximately 15 kb in length and encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) comprising of ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs3-7 and the recently discovered ORF5a [8], [9]. ORF1a and ORF1b comprised approximately two-third of the genome encode the replicase polyproteins which are considered to be autoproteolytically cleaved into at least 14 non-structural proteins (NSPs) including the newly discovered transframe fusion (TF) in NSP2-coding region [10], [11].",

            "text": "Among the 14 NSPs of PRRSV, NSP2 is the largest replication protein with three major domains\u2013an N-terminal papain-like cysteine protease domain (PLP2), a functionally unspecified middle hypervariable region and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain [12], [13]. A number of studies have indicated that the middle hypervariable region of the NSP2 is able to tolerate foreign gene insertion and deletion [12], [14], [15]. As well, it has been verified that the atypical PRRS outbreak in China was caused by a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain with 30-amino-acid deletion in this coding region [15], [16]. NSP2 was also recognized to play an important role in the PRRSV replication, in which the PLP2 possesses both trans- and cis-cleavage activities involving in viral replicase polyprotein processing that is cleaved at the NSP2\u2013NSP3 (NSP2/3) junction [17]\u2013[19]. In addition, the NSP2 of arterivirus can collaborate with NSP3 to form the double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are derived from paired endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and these DMVs provide the sites for viral RNA synthesis [20]\u2013[22]. The PLP2 of NSP2 was also considered to belong to the ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing superfamily and possess the deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities to inhibit Ub- and ISG15-dependent antiviral pathways [23]\u2013[26]. During the past years, a number of studies have provided evidence that protein ubiquitylation plays an important role in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune system, and meanwhile, some viruses take advantage of the OTU domain-containing proteases to regulate Ub-dependent innate immunity via its DUB protease activity [27], [28]. Previous studies showed that the NSP2 of PRRSV can exploit its DUB potential to inhibit NF-\u03baB and RIG-mediated innate immune signaling [8], [25], [29], and the loss of DUB activity may strikingly enhance innate immune signaling [30]. Thus, these findings reveal that NSP2 not only is a critical factor in the virus replication, but also can involve in the virus evasion from innate immune. However, the molecular mechanisms of its involvement in these functions have not been elucidated clearly.",

The sequences of porcine BAG6 and AIF1 genes have been submitted to GenBank (accession nos: KF941298, KF941299). Three plasmids\u2013CMV-FLAG-BAG6, CMV-FLAG-AIF1 and pCMV-HA-NSP2 were constructed.

And then the immune-complexes were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE and probed for the presence of BAG6 or AIF1 by using anti-FLAG antibody. The results showed that Both BAG6 and AIF1 could be readily detected only in the presence of NSP2, but not in the presence of empty vector (Figure 7A and B). The similar results were obtained in another Co-IP experiment by using anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 7C and D). In order to further confirm the interaction between these two host proteins and NSP2, the MARC-145 cells were infected with RvMyc-JXwn and RvJXwn respectively, and then the endogenous BAG6 and AIF1 that interact with NSP2 were examined by using IP with anti-Myc antibody. The endogenous BAG6 and AIF1 could be detected in RvMyc-JXwn-infected cells, but not in RvJXwn-infected cells (Figure 7E).

Importantly, with collaborated with NSP3, the NSP2 can form the double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that provide the sites for viral RNA synthesis [43].

Firstly, the PRRSV translate its two replicase proteins coded by ORF1a and ORF1b, by employing the host translation system, to yield the polyprotein precursors pp1a and pp1ab, resulting in the generation the replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) through autoproteolysis [11], [46], [47].

PRRSV has been reported to infect porcine monocyte-derived DC (Mo-DC), and induce cell death and down-regulate the expression of MHC class I, MHC class II, CD11 b/c and CD14, resulting in the impairment of the antigen presentation ability of Mo-DC [49]. In addition, PRRSV infection can mediate apoptosis in B-cell and T-cell in lymphoid organs [50], but which proteins of PRRSV are involved in these phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Our data hint that NSP2 may involve in these progress. A number of evidences have indicated that NSP2 is able to regulate NF-\u03baB and RIG-mediated innate immune signaling pathway to suppress the host immune responses [24], [25], [29], [30]. Together with the data reported previously, our results provide an important clue for studying the NSP2 functions on the induction of immunosuppression and persistent infection induced by PRRSV.",

The nervous symptom can be observed in PRRSV-infected pigs, which was supported by some evidence in previous pathogenicity analysis showing that PRRSV infection could induce the central nervous system (CNS) lesions including lymphohistiocytic perivascular cuffing, gliosis and mild vasculitis [51], [52]. In addition, the PRRSV antigen can be detected in the cerebellum [53] and the virus can be isolated from the brain tissues of infected animals [54], [55]. To date, little has been done to elucidate the molecular mechanism related to the nervous system lesions caused by PRRSV. These results implied that NSP2 might be involved in the process of the nervous system lesions during PRRSV infection. Therefore, a more profound endeavor will be needed to focus on exploring the mechanism of how NSP2 involved in the influence on nervous system.",

            "text": "It has been confirmed that the virus-driven DMVs, which are originated from ER membranes, can be observed in the arterivirus-infected cells [20]\u2013[22]. The DMVs are thought to be associated with the RTCs, which provide suitable environment for viral RNA synthesis and preventing host anti-virus defense system [43]. The Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed that NSP2 is localized to DMVs21, but how the NSP2 is transported to DMVs is still unknown. Out of the 285 identified cellular proteins, 17 proteins were involved in the pathway of protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, including one interesting protein-BAG6 which we are interested for further analysis. BAG6 is also called as BAT3 (HLA-B-associated transcript 3) or Scythe, which is located in the major histocompatibility complex class \u0399\u0399\u0399 (MHC \u0399\u0399\u0399) of human chromosome 6 [56]. Recently, a series of studies have described that BAG6 is a master regulator of tail-anchored (TA) protein quality control [57]. The TA proteins possess a hydrophobic transmembrane sequence near the C-terminus and hydrophilic N-termini in the cytoplasm [58]. And the newly synthesized TA proteins that are bound by BAG6 have different fates. Some proteins can be delivered to the ER membrane [59], [60], whereas others can be degraded by BAG6-associated ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway [61], [62]. NSP2 of PRRSV has the similar structure to the TA proteins, with a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain and hydrophilic N-termini [12], [13]. In addition, NSP2 possess the de-conjugating activity and the ability to inhibit the polyubiquitination process [23]\u2013[25]. Based on the evidence mentioned above, we speculate that NSP2 is more likely transported to ER membrane by BAG6 complex, instead of being degraded by BAG6 recruited ubiquitin-proteasome system. The interesting issue how PRRSV exploit BAG6 to sustain viral propagation and survival in host cells will be conducted in our future research.",

As well known, AIF1 is a mitochondrial flavoprotein contributing to caspase-independent cell death [66], and it also plays a key role in mediating poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)-dependent cell death [67], [68]. The pivotal process of AIF1-inducing apoptosis is that mitochondrial AIF1 translocates to nucleus and induces chromatin condensation and large-scale DNA fragmentation [69]. More and more experiments have proven that the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway is activated by PRRSV infection [70]\u2013[72] and NSP2 play a crucial role in inducing apoptosis [73]. Here, based on the interaction between NSP2 and AIF1 we suggest that the caspase-independent apoptosis may be involved in PRRSV-driven apoptosis.",

According to the Gene Ontology and enriched KEGG Pathway analysis, the identified proteins were assigned to different subcellular locations and functional classes. The interactome profile of NSP2 with the host cellular proteins was first drawn to gain a functional insight into the host-virus proteins interaction. Moreover, two interested host cellular proteins BAG6 and AIF1, which may involve in the transportation of NSP2 to ER or PRRSV-driven apoptosis, were confirmed to interact with NSP2 by Co-IP and Western blot. In summary, our results not only provide valuable information for understanding the roles of NSP2 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV, but also offer novel host cellular protein targets for elucidating the associated molecular mechanisms of the interaction between host cellular proteins and viral proteins in regulating the viral replication.",
