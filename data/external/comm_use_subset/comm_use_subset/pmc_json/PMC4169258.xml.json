            "text": "Emerging infectious disease (EID) epidemics and pandemics arise without warning, even with global efforts aimed at tracking pathogens early and at the source, a fact most recently evidenced by the swift global spread of influenza H1N1 [1], [2] and a current outbreak of ebolavirus affecting multiple West African countries simultaneously [3]. Most major human EIDs are of zoonotic origin and include viral infections of both global (HIV-1, HIV-2, H1N1) and localized significance (ebolavirus, monkeypox, Marburgvirus, Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-associated coronavirus) [2]. Systematic monitoring of people and wildlife at hotspots of EID is one strategy for preventing human pathogens of animal origin from reaching a pandemic state [4]. By detecting animal pathogens before or just as they emerge in humans, it may be possible to mitigate against their worldwide spread [2]. Furthermore, in the case of some diseases such as Ebola virus disease (EVD), the monitoring of wildlife disease serves as a critical component of early warning systems aimed at preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans [5], [6]. EVD has repeatedly passed from infected apes to hunters, leading to multiple epidemics and 360 human deaths (463 cases) in Gabon and the Republic of Congo (RoC) alone since 1994 [5], [7]\u2013[9]. More significantly, human epidemics are often preceded by observed animal outbreaks, underlining the human health implications of surveillance and control of epizootics [5], [6].",

Ebolavirus is lethal in humans and nonhuman primates and has been described as a significant threat to the survival of western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Central Africa [7], [10], [11]. Data from ecological surveys in Central African ape habitats illustrate declines in ape signs (nests, feces, prints) temporally and spatially linked with confirmed human EVD outbreaks [12]\u2013[14]. Mathematical modeling suggests that, between 1983 and 2000, gorilla numbers in Gabon dropped by more than 56%, and it is hypothesized that infectious pathogens, including ebolavirus and Bacillus anthracis, may contribute to gorilla mortality in Africa [10], [12], [15].",

For SIV, feces have also shown the presence of virus-specific antibodies [23]. We developed a non-invasive immunological assay to detect ebolavirus antibodies in great ape feces, allowing us more insight into wild ape ebolavirus infections and their surveillance, and leading the way to identifying the best approaches for their protection. In addition, this new assay may prove valuable in the development and employment of prospective epidemiological ebolavirus studies in wild great ape populations.",

Genotype studies have demonstrated that feces collected using these methods are accurately classified as gorilla feces 98% of the time [30]. In addition, the presence of long tri-lobed sections, ample fiber, and abundant green leafy material further classified these samples as gorilla dung [31], [32].

Feces were vigorously mixed in RNAlater (Ambion Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1.5 ml of the mixture diluted in 7.5 ml of PBS-Tween-20 (0.05%), heated at 60\u00b0C for 60 minutes, centrifuged at 3500\u00d7g for 20 minutes and dialyzed in PBS 1X with stir bar at 4\u00b0C for 18 to 24 hours to resuspend fecal immunoglobulins that normally precipitate in RNAlater. Purified or cell lysate NP protein was denatured in Sample Reducing Agent (Invitrogen NuPAGE), heated at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes, separated by 4\u201312% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (0.25 \u00b5g per well) (Invitrogen NP0321, Carlsbad, California, USA), and followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen LC2001, Carlsbad, California, USA) which was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-Tween (0.3%) and bovine albumin (2.4%). Membranes were then cut into strips and incubated overnight in fecal extract on a rocking plate. Specific NP-bound antibody was detected with goat-anti-human IgG peroxidase conjugate and the blot was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The films were exposed to the immunoblot strips then scanned using an Epson Perfection 4870 Photo scanner. To define a cut-off of positivity we used the Image J program (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) that allowed us to subtract the background in each strip and to compute the integrated density of the band that is the sum of the values of the pixels in the selection in the blot. Specimens which showed no visible specific band in the blots were scored as negative whereas those which showed specific band (reactivity with a protein of approximate molecular mass of 115 kDa corresponding to EBOV nucleoprotein NP) were regarded as positive if their integrated density was in excess of the mean of integrated density plus 3 standard deviations of the negative blots. Blots with a weak specific visible band and an integrated density below this cutoff were classified as uncertain. A subset of samples collected in 2005 (the year of the last EVD outbreak in the region) was also screened for the presence of filovirus RNA using a nested RT-PCR. Fifty nanograms of total RNA isolated from RNAlater preserved fecal samples were extracted using the RNAqueous 4PCR kit (Ambion Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and used in a one-step RT-PCR, followed by a nested PCR step. We used degenerate primer pairs in order to amplify a 245 bp fragment of the L polymerase gene from any Filovirus. The one step RT-PCR primers are: 5\u2032- ATMGRAAYTTTTCYTTYTCATT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032RYTATAAWARTCACTRACATGCAT-3\u2032; the nested PCR primers are 5\u2032-TTYCCWAGYAAYATGATGGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- GGDATTRDRWARTGCATCCA-3\u2032.",

Furthermore, a similar approach was used to diagnose simian foamy virus infection in wild chimpanzees (SFVcpz). The sensitivities of SFVcpz antibody and viral nucleic acid detection in fecal samples from captive chimpanzees were 73% and 75% respectively, and assay specificities were 100% [34].

A similar level of sensitivity was observed for detection of anti-SIV and anti-HIV antibodies by western immunoblots using plasma samples from SIVsm-infected NHP diluted up to 10\u22124 and plasma samples from HIV-1 infected individual diluted up to 10\u22126\n[40]. In contrast, fecal extracts from captive and uninfected nonhuman primates (cynomolgus macaque and western lowland gorilla species) treated in the same way showed no reactivity in the NP immunoblot, demonstrating low background for the assay and lack of cross-reactivity with serum antibodies directed against irrelevant proteins. These results demonstrated that NP antibodies present in primate fecal samples can be extracted and detected by immunoblotting.",

The presence of long-term and functioning wildlife disease surveillance programs and gorilla habituation and research studies in the RoC allowed for immediate access to the DCO region during and after EVD epidemics which facilitated the collection of 35 samples from gorillas with a high likelihood of previous exposure to EBOV, and samples were collected at this site within 25\u201343 months of confirmed great ape EVD cases being found. The second region is an area with no reported outbreaks at that time (NRO).

As expected, there is also nothing known regarding potential co-infections involved in great ape EVD which may modify the host immune response, alter pathogenesis, increase mortality or influence the effectiveness of any future prophylactic plans, such as the administration of a vaccine once available. This is due to the difficulty in acquiring diagnostic samples from wild populations. Capture and subsequent blood collection for serological screening is costly, time consuming, and carries some risk to the animals while providing information on only a few individuals. In fact, despite the disappearance of a staggering number of great apes in Gabon and the RoC and 6 years of sustained and active surveillance in these countries during the course of this study, only 37 carcasses were recovered, with confirmed EBOV infection in 16 of those individuals [9]\u2013[11],[24]. Moreover, finding animal carcasses in vast tracts of rain forest is difficult; it requires intensive searching and often results in the acquisition of highly degraded samples, which are not suitable for detection of viral antigens or nucleic acid and are more prone to negative results [5].",

Since genetic identification of individual fecal samples was not performed, we cannot rule out the possibility of resampling, so the prevalence rate is an upper limit for this data set. However, recent genetic analysis of gorilla and chimpanzee samples collected during iron-cross recces (the type of surveillance executed in sites B1, C, and D) from 2006\u20132010 suggest a low resampling rate. Of 162 samples, three were identified with genetic identity the same as three previously sampled individuals, yielding a 2% resampling rate for sites in which the same site was revisited with the shortest interval of seven-months apart; the resampling rate in the currently study could be higher because two sites were sampled one-month apart and two locations, A and B2, were not iron-cross recces (personal communication, K.J. Lee)",

It provides the potential to employ serial fecal collections to detect a temporal change in incidence exposure in a given zone. For instance, we saw a trend toward a decrease in ebolavirus fecal antibodies in zone B1/B2 from 20% in 2005 to 12% in 2007, which can be tested in the future using formal prospective studies. Fecal antibody screening can also be used before and after vaccination to demonstrate vaccine-induced immune responses developed in great ape populations, noting that antibody levels in vaccinated non-human primates are an immune correlate of protection [42]. Finally, this approach will facilitate the identification of immunologically na\u00efve populations for large-scale vaccination trials, thereby improving cost-effectiveness by identifying communities that could benefit the most from vaccination efforts. Along these lines, it provides us with the first real possibility to investigate patterns of EVD emergence in wild apes independent of animal mortality and the role natural barriers, such as rivers, may have in mitigating its spread. This ability to map exposure patterns across Central Africa may also provide insight into how this virus spreads within and between ape populations, a question that has generated two disparate theories: multiple virus introductions and a single spreading outbreak [10], [11], [24], [44].",

The strategy described herein will be valuable in providing zoonotic information of public health concern from regions where resources are poor and help counter the emergence of diseases which have potential to become the next pandemic. Monitoring diseases in animals using methods such as those we describe here allows for the identification and surveillance of many pathogens, including those with potential to adapt and spread in humans, like HIV and plasmodium parasites [23], [46], [47].

Recent concerns surround the role pigs play in the emergence of diseases such Reston ebolavirus and H1N1 [1], [48]. Central Africa's forests are home to tens of thousands of wild pigs, including the Giant Forest Hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni) and the Red River Hog (Potamochoerus porcus), and are characterized as emerging disease hotspots [45]. Although no evidence has emerged supporting speculation of ebolavirus-associated wild pig die-offs in Africa, employing this assay in these species may address whether pigs are amplifiers, victims or carriers of the virus [48]. It is noteworthy that in the case of influenza pigs are considered \u201cmixing vessels\u201d for viruses and capable of generating new strains transmissible to humans [49]. The extensive bush meat trade in Africa provides ample opportunity for pathogen transmission from pigs to humans, and underlines the importance of disease surveillance in this species.",
