Among all currently available viral vectors, adenovirus (Ad) is one of the most efficient gene delivery systems, but pre-existing immunity against common human serotypes, such as Ad5, is hampering its use in humans. Non-human primate-derived Ad, such as chimpanzee Ad serotype 7 (AdC7), are alternative vectors and are less likely to be affected by pre-existing immunity [10,11,12]. We have previously reported that anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibodies do not cross-neutralize AdC7, and that maternal immunization of mice with the AdC7 vector expressing RSV vaccine antigen can protect their pups against RSV infection [13]. Therefore, we adopted AdC7 as a gene transfer vector to deliver anti-RSV neutralizing antibody to infants, expecting a successful application in the presence of maternal anti-human Ad antibodies.",

Intravenous administration of palivizumab was shown to be effective in rodents and humans, effectively reducing lung RSV load in the lung of cotton rats [20] and being detectable in human nasal washes [21]. It is known that intramuscularly injected palivizumab is slowly absorbed and maximum serum concentrations are reached at three to five days [22], but the kinetics of lung and airway levels are less well-known. Our data showed that the anti-RSV IgG was detected in the BAL after intranasal administration but not intramuscular administration at the time of peak serum IgG levels (at one week). The intranasal administration route may be advantageous through the production of the neutralizing antibodies directly by the respiratory mucosal cells, the primary target of RSV. Future studies should examine the cellular source of the antibody within the respiratory mucosa, and include more analyses of the nose-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) immune cells.",

Another potential advantage of neonatal gene delivery is the higher vector particles-to-cell ratio, requiring a lower relative dose [15].

We focused on passive immunization in this study, but the combination of AdC7-based passive immunization and AdC7-based active immunization can be an attractive strategy to provide complete protective immunity throughout the vulnerable period. Since mature responses to vaccines can also be expected in the neonatal immune system [14], simultaneous administration of AdC7 which carries anti-RSV neutralizing antibody and RSV vaccine antigen may provide both passive and active immunization.

Prolonged expression was seen when the vectors were administered to neonatal mice, but we could not estimate the half-life of antibodies since a serial collection of neonatal serum was not feasible. Several explanations can be possible for the prolonged expression. The antibody may have had a longer half-life than in adult mice because of the unique immunological properties of neonatal mice. The efficiency of gene delivery may have been greater due to the higher susceptibility to Ad of neonatal lungs. Recently, the development of new anti-RSV monoclonal antibodies went toward prolongation of the serum half-life. The amino acid modification made it possible to extend the serum half-life of the antibody [28,29].

Supernatants of HEK-293 cells infected with AdC7\u03b1RSV were assessed for the presence of functional anti-RSV IgG. (A) Binding to RSV. Supernatants were incubated with RSV Line19 or Ad5 (control) immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane followed by an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG. Mouse serum 8 weeks post infection with RSV was used as a positive control (lane 4). (B) Plaque-reduction assay. Serial dilutions of supernatants were incubated with RSV Line19 (5 \u00d7 103 pfu/mL) for 1 h, followed by infection of Vero cells. Data are shown as % reduction of plaques after 4 days, with mean \u00b1 SEM of 4 replicates.",
