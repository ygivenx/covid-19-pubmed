RA is a chronic and severely disabling disease of unknown etiology, although both environmental [3] and genetic factors [4] are believed to play roles in its cause. There is presently no cure for RA, although a variety of different drugs is used to treat the symptoms. The most common treatments include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as,methotrexate [5,6]. Other efficient antirheumatic drugs are the recently developed biological-response modifiers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 blockers, which reduce both the established inflammation and joint destruction [7]. The drawback of these treatments is an increased risk of infections because the body's defense system is impaired. Other biological-response modifiers targeting other cytokines or costimulatory molecules are currently being clinically tested and evaluated [8]. Despite this range of antirheumatic drugs, there is still a large number of RA patients for whom none of these treatments is effective [9,10], thus making the development of new therapies essential.",

This finding was a result of linkage analysis and positional cloning in an arthritis model in rats using a cross between the arthritis-susceptible dark agouti (DA) rat and the arthritis-resistant E3 strains DA.Ncf1E3([14,16]. NCF-1 is the activating component of the NADPH oxidase complex, which, upon activation, produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) [17]. We found that the dramatic increase in arthritis severity was caused by a decreased capacity of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex to produce ROS. Interestingly, the lower oxidative burst led to a reduction in cell membrane proteins and activation of autoreactive and arthritogenic T cells [18]. Thus, the identified Ncf1 polymorphism and its effect on the immune system by decreased ROS production was concluded to be associated with the regulation of arthritogenic CD4 T cells in the immune priming phase [14,19].",

To analyze the in vivo effects of the NADPH oxidase activator phytol versus the effects of the arthritis-inducing compound pristane, global gene-expression profiling was performed. A biodistribution analysis of phytol was performed to determine which tissue and time point would be most relevant to investigate. Phytol was observed to accumulate slowly in inguinal lymph nodes, with peak levels being reached approximately 11 days after subcutaneous administration, which coincides with the onset period of arthritis. In the global gene-expression profiling, inguinal lymph nodes obtained 10 days after administration were analyzed. This analysis revealed several genes that were differentially expressed in rats with PIA compared with rats injected with phytol. A group of interesting genes was selected and verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis in three further separate biological experiments, including a comparative study between the DA and DA.Ncf1E3 congenic rats. The comparison between the two strains was aimed at determining whether the selected genes were differentially expressed in the arthritis-susceptible DA rat versus the arthritis-resistant congenic DA.Ncf1E3 rat. Such data would indicate whether the NADPH oxidase-activating compound phytol is activating a pathway that is normally inactive in the absence of a fully functional Ncf1.",

Various organs (inguinal lymph nodes, spleen, heart, thymus, kidney, liver, lung, fat, muscle and peripheral blood) were collected, homogenized and analyzed in a beta counter to determine tissue-incorporated tritiated phytol. Most of the administered phytol remained as a depot at the injection site (> 90%, data not shown), whereas phytol distributed to tissues was recovered mainly from the inguinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, the accumulation of phytol in the lymph nodes reached its maximum level 11 days after administration (Figure 1). No phytol was detected in peripheral blood at the time points studied or in blood collected at earlier time points (2, 6, 13 or 25 hours after administration, data not shown). Further analysis of the biodistribution of phytol at the microscopic level in the inguinal lymph nodes was performed by microautoradiography. It was shown that phytol was distributed primarily to the cortical regions and also in the sinusoidal space of the inguinal lymph nodes (data not shown).

All animals were killed close to disease onset, i.e.10 days after administration. Global gene-expression profiling using chip arrays (Genechip\u00ae;Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was performed on the collected inguinal lymph nodes from the described animals. The gene-expression pattern was quite different between treated rats and na\u00efve controls. Comparing any of the group of treated animals and untreated animals, > 350 differentially expressed genes were detected (at significance level p < 0.05 and absolute fold change > 1.4; data not shown). However, as the most interesting differences were to be found between the different treatments, the analysis focused on these groups. When comparing phytol-treated versus pristane-treated animals, the expression of 29 genes was significantly changed (p < 0.05, with absolute fold change > 1.4). Of these 29 genes, 13 showed expression in phytol-treated rats, whereas 16 genes showed higher expression in pristane-treated rats (Figure 2).

These proteins have chemoattraction and growth-promoting properties and are induced by IFN-\u03b3 and, to some extent, TNF-\u03b1 to attract T cells to sites of inflammation [26]. Higher levels of CXCL9 expression have been observed in the synovial tissues and fluids of patients with RA compared with tissues and fluids from control patients [27]. MMP12 (matrix metalloproteinase 12) belongs to the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [28], which are involved in cell migration and degradation of cartilage and bone by remodeling the extracellular matrix. Inducers of expression of MMPs include IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 [29] and IFN-\u03b3 [30]. Abnormal levels of MMPs have been found in patients with autoimmune disorders such as RA and multiple sclerosis [31].",

The cytokines IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 have been shown to induce BEST5 expression in osteoblasts [32].Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7 belongs to the IRF family of transcription factors involved in cell growth, antiviral defense and immune activation in lymphoid cells in spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood [33,34]. IRF7 is part of the pathway activated by viral infection to induce the production of IFN type I (IFNt\u03b1/\u03b2) by a positive feedback loop [35]. IRF7 was recently reported to be the master regulator of IFN type I-dependent immune responses [36], and recent publications have shown that an IRF5 polymorphism is strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [37,38]. Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)-3 is induced by IFN-\u03b1 [39] and IFN-\u03b2 but not IFN-\u03b3 [40]. However, IRF-7 most probably has a dual role, being both a strong regulator of IFN expression [35] and being induced by IFN in a positive feedback regulation [35,41].",

The expression of Ifn\u03b3 was significantly increased in the rats injected with pristane (p < 0.01) and expression of Ifn\u03b1 and Ifn\u03b2 was increased after injection with phytol. To further validate the significance of the increased expression of Ifn\u03b1 and Ifn\u03b2 in DA rats at day 10 after treatment with phytol, RNA samples produced from all four separate experiments was analyzed for Ifn\u03b1 and Ifn\u03b2 expression levels in DA rats treated with either pristane (n = 19) or phytol (n = 18). This combined dataset showed an upregulation of IFN-\u03b1 (p < 0.05) and an upregulation of IFN-\u03b2 (p < 0.01) in phytol-treated compared with pristane-treated animals. The increased expression of Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 coincided with the most pronounced increase in expression of Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Oas1, Mx2 and S100a9, i.e. day 8\u201310 after treatment (Figure 5 and Figure 6A, B). Hence, Ifn\u03b1 and Ifn\u03b2 could be postulated to be common regulatory genes for this molecular pathway of genes that were all induced by phytol treatment. However, it should be noted that the expression levels of the studied type I interferons were very low and that the difference in expression levels could only be detected using quantitative real-time PCR (Figures 6 and 9).",

We observed that the expression of our set of differentially expressed genes in our material varies dramatically during the disease progress (Figures 4, 5, 6). Therefore, it is necessary to have information about which time point and tissue to analyze before initiating gene-expression profiling. Furthermore, we also analyzed, in other tissues (i.e. thymus, blood and spleen) the expression of the genes identified as differentially expressed in inguinal lymph nodes, and observed that the expression levels could be quite different or even undetectable in these tissues (data not shown). As a result, it is not possible to extrapolate the information between tissues and time points. In addition, the number of biological replicates used in the compared groups should be high enough to enable statistical analysis. Altogether, these issues make these studies extremely cumbersome to perform, especially when analyzing human samples. By using animal models, a more optimized study design may be provided [60], as a number of identical (inbred) individuals under the same treatment and environmental conditions are compared and tissue collected at the same time point by the same researcher.",

However, it is not the differentially expressed genes per se that are most interesting, but the molecular pathways that can be extracted (Figure 11). From our comparison between pristane (arthritis inducer [21]) and phytol (NADPH oxidase-activating and arthritis-ameliorating compound [20]), two main pathways were identified. The pristane-induced pathway was marked by increased expression of Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12 (Table 1). These genes all share IFN-\u03b3 as a common regulator [30,61,62], which was also shown to be upregulated in the inguinal lymph nodes, in a similar pattern, after induction of arthritis with pristane (Figures 4, 6C, 7 and 9C). IFN-\u03b3 is known to effect the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells, and increased expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine plays an important role in the progression of RA [63]. Although pristane stimulates the expression of these cytokine-regulated genes, no direct conclusions about whether these genes are involved in the cause of arthritis can be drawn, as no difference in gene expression could be seen between the arthritis-susceptible strain (DA) and the arthritis-protected strain (DA.Ncf1E3) (Figures 7 and 9C). As the DA.Ncf1E3 congenic rats carry the arthritis-protecting variant of Ncf1, one might speculate that the effect caused by the functional Ncf1 is to generate a resistance to the effect from induction of Ass, Cxcl9 and Mmp12 genes, which might otherwise contribute to the development of arthritis. Further investigation of the effect on disease regulation is needed to be able to propose a more exact role for these genes as potential markers of arthritis [64].",

These interferons are anti-inflammatory cytokines expressed after pathogenic infections [35,65,66]. From the gene-expression data it is not possible to determine whether IRF-7 is upregulated by an increased level of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 as a downstream feedback regulator of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor or if increased IFN-\u03b2 level is the result of an upregulation of IRF-7 [35,41,36]. Oas1 and Mx2 are both induced upon viral invasion and IFN type I activation, and are thus regulated by the same pathway [67]. The expression of Best5 can be induced by both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, but studies have shown IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 to have the strongest enhancing effect on the expression [32].",

            "text": "Interestingly, a clear tendency in the expression of Ifn\u03b2 between DA and DA.Ncf1E3 strains was observed after injection with pristane, with the DA.Ncf1E3 rats having higher expression of Ifn\u03b2 than the DA rats (Figure 9B). This difference in expression level clearly resembles the differences observed for the phytol-induced genes Best5, Irf7, Ifit3, Mx2 and Oas1 (Figure 8). It is therefore likely that the downstream effect of the polymorphism in Ncf1, as well as the therapeutic effect of phytol, involves regulation of an IFN-\u03b2 pathway. This IFN-\u03b2-regulated gene profile is interesting with respect to similarities to the patterns that have been identified in patients with SLE and in patients with juvenile arthritis treated with anti-TNF-\u03b1 [68-71], and in mouse models of SLE [72]. Subpopulations with active RA have also been shown to express increased levels of Ifn type I signature genes in peripheral blood [59]. These reports show an Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 expression signature, which is very similar to that identified in the rats treated with phytol. However, in our study, the Ifn type I expression profile was linked to disease protection while the SLE Ifn type I profile was linked to disease progression. This may indicate that the interferon balance could be an important threshold denominator of autoimmune diseases, functioning as an essential balance for immune regulation, with an imbalance resulting in either SLE or arthritis. This is also exemplified by a recent study in which pristane was used to induce SLE in mice. In that study, chronic peritoneal administration of pristane elicited increased expression of the type I interferon-inducible genes Mx1, Irf7, IP-10 and Isg-15 as a consequence of SLE [72]. However, despite the similarities in expression pattern, it must be noted that the SLE studies were performed on tissues other than inguinal lymph nodes and on established disease, so that differences in gene profiles could be caused by tissue differences or time-dependent regulation. Also interesting is the fact that the present study points towards a disease-ameliorating pathway that is regulated by IFN-\u03b2. Therefore, as the present observation of increased Ifn type I signature genes was observed to be a signal for prevention of disease onset, in contrast to the studies in ongoing SLE [68]and arthritis [59], one might speculate that increased IFN type I regulation is a way to downregulate an ongoing immune response. Such an attempt to limit the inflammatory response has been suggested previously [73], and has also been indicated by experiments in our laboratory using Ifn\u03b2-deficient mice, where a prolonged arthritis severity was observed due to Ifn\u03b2 deficiency [74]. In fact, treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 significantly reduces cartilage destruction and bone destruction in collagen-induced arthritis in mice, which suggested a beneficial effect in patients also [70]. However, to date no positive outcome of clinical trials using recombinant IFN-\u03b2 in RA has been presented [75,76]. As we have shown that the effect of phytol on Ifn\u03b2-related genes is time-dependent and also correlates with the biodistribution of phytol to the inguinal lymph nodes, it is possible that tissue distribution as well as the dose and frequency of administration are crucial for the efficacy of arthritis treatment via this pathway.",

However, the expression of S100a9 did not show any difference between DA and DA.Ncf1E3 rats (Figure 8F), and the expression profile was not similar to that of Ifn\u03b2 (Figure 9B). As a result, we consider S100a9 not to be regulated by IFN-\u03b2. It is more likely that the increased levels of S100a9 expression is a direct effect of increased concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ induced by the NADPH oxidase-produced ROS [78,79]. Increased expression of S100a9 is mostly reported to be proinflammatory. However, this knowledge is based on analyses from tissues and blood during ongoing inflammation, while these studies analyzed inguinal lymph nodes prior to disease onset. Hence, the expression levels for different timepoints of the disease process could differ. Even so, S100a9 may be a good biomarker for the in vivo efficacy of administered phytol as an activator of NADPH oxidase specifically in lymph node tissues.",
