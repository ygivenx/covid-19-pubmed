Exposure of cervical tissues to NG (3 \u00d7 106) induced high levels of IL6, IL8, IL\u20101\u03b2, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 at both 24 and 48 hours after NG inoculation, with IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 being the highest compared to control tissues exposed to media (2500 pg/mL for IL\u20101\u03b2 and 500 pg/mL for TNF\u2010\u03b1 in NG exposed compared to 10 pg/mL and 17 pg/mL in control media, respectively). This increase in the cytokine production was noted both at the mRNA level (Figure 2A) as well as the secreted protein levels (Figure 2B). A change of 5\u2010 to 10\u2010fold in mRNA and 100\u2010fold to 200\u2010fold in protein for IL\u20101\u03b2, and 2\u2010 to 5\u2010fold in mRNA and 5\u2010 to 10\u2010fold in protein for TNF\u2010\u03b1 was noted. There was a statistically significant (P \u2264 0.05) increase in the level of IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 protein in supernatant at both time points although we did not observe a significant increase in TNF\u2010\u03b1 mRNA at 24 hours. These cytokines were selected on the basis of prior literature, which demonstrated that they were elevated in genital lavages from patients with NG infection as well as studies conducted with NG exposure on epithelium cell lines.15, 18, 45 Longer exposure of tissues to NG for 7 days induced higher elevation of these cytokine mRNA compared to 24 hours (Figure S1a). As a control, Lactobacillus plantarum did not induce significant levels of cytokine responses upon their exposure to the cervical tissues (data not shown). To determine whether live NG was required for induction of cytokine response, cervical tissues in the same organ culture were exposed to heat\u2010killed (65\u00b0C for 30 minutes) NG for 24 and 48 hours No significant difference in the cytokine levels between the heat\u2010killed and live NG was observed (Figure 2E), indicating that live NG was not essential for the inflammatory cytokine response. These results implied that outer membrane structures of NG might be sufficient for inducing inflammatory responses.",

We tested the possibility of increased recruitment of CD3+ cells by quantifying immune cells in the intraepithelial region upon 24 hour of NG exposure to tissues by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 3(G,H), significantly higher numbers of CD3+ T cells were localized in the intraepithelial layer in the tissue exposed to NG, compared to tissues exposed to control media.

This includes the minimal toxicity of NG to cervical tissue, NG\u2010induced membrane ruffling, and induction of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines with the highest being that of IL\u20101\u03b2 and TNF\u2010\u03b1.

This is in accord with recent data showing heptose monophosphate (HMP) secreted from NG\u2010infected cells activates the HIV\u20101 LTR in CD4+ T cells.20 Most importantly, NGIS enhanced HIV\u20101 transmission across cervical mucosa, most likely by increasing HIV\u20101 transcription in the sub\u2010mucosa.

            "text": "Another problem in investigating molecular determinants of NG\u2010driven increased HIV\u20101 acquisition in the female genital tract is due to our lack of a clear understanding of cellular factors that are responsible for HIV\u20101 transmission through epithelia of the cervical mucosa, especially when cervical epithelia do not express significant amount of CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4.24, 25 The other parts of the female reproductive tract especially the uterine epithelium have however been shown to express HIV\u20101 receptors/co\u2010receptors.60 We have reasoned that pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines often present in genital secretions of patients with NG12, 13, 14, 15 interact with cellular factors responsible for HIV\u20101 transmission and thereby enhance HIV\u20101 transmission. Here we provided evidence using transcriptome analysis of cervical epithelium exposed to NG or HIV\u20101, that NG infection induced in cervical epithelia two cellular proteins CXCL10 and IL\u20108 that were also induced during HIV\u20101 transmission across cervical mucosa. Furthermore, the role of CXCL10 and IL\u20108 on HIV\u20101 transmission has been confirmed by the finding of enhanced HIV\u20101 transmission with direct addition of CXCL10 and IL8, and inhibition of HIV\u20101 transmission by inhibitors of CXCL10 and IL\u20108.",

            "text": "To decipher how NG infection might be involved in upregulation of CXCL10 and IL\u20108, we noticed that IL\u20101\u03b2 secreted by NG has been shown to induce CXCL10 and IL\u20108 in intestinal epithelial cells. Our data in cervical tissue also showed that IL\u20101\u03b2 induced CXCL10 and IL\u20108 expression with a concomitant increase in HIV\u20101 transmission across cervical mucosa. In addition, NG infection causes migration of CD3+ T cells toward the intraepithelial region which is in line with known chemo\u2010attractant properties of CXCL10 and IL\u20108 for CD3+ T cells and macrophages that have been predicted from the IPA analysis of differentially expressed genes in HIV\u20101\u2010 and NG\u2010exposed epithelia. Furthermore, it has been shown that CD4+ cells are the first cells that become infected within 24 hours of infection during HIV\u20101 transmission across cervical mucosa.33, 61 Altogether these data are consistent with a model (Figure 6) for NG\u2010induced enhancement of HIV\u20101 transmission: NG infection leads to secretion of IL\u20101\u03b2, which induces production of epithelial CXCL10 and IL\u20108. Upon HIV\u20101 infection, increase of these cytokines causes migration of the CD3+ T cells toward the intraepithelial region which fuels higher HIV\u20101 replication in the sub\u2010mucosa and consequently enhances HIV\u20101 transmission. Identification of IL\u20101\u03b2 and its target cellular proteins in NG\u2010induced enhanced HIV\u20101 transmission could be useful in development of drugs that impede the HIV\u20101 transmission. The explant models have a few disadvantages to using a full animal model. The cellular circulation system here is limited; therefore, it does not help study the mechanism of migration of cells to different areas of the body. In spite of this, the system is well equipped to study the basic immediate impact of HIV\u20101 infection and its transmission across the mucosa along with the migration of cells from the basal to the apical end of the tissue explants.33 Another limitation of this study is the small sample size. This is primarily because of the low availability of cervical tissues to work with, and thus, we could not use more than 3 tissues for any experiment. There is also a difference in age, race, and the menstrual cycle among different tissues obtained which may affect the susceptibility to infection. This may be the reason why some tissues transmitted more easily and produced more cytokine response than the others when exposed to HIV\u20101 or NG. Like in our case, one tissue exposed to HIV\u20101 during the cytokine upregulation study showed very high cytokine response compared to others. This was a more susceptible tissue. The higher sample size (n = 14) in this study (Table 2) helped in determining the significance of the study. Future work in non\u2010human primates or humanized mouse models could provide further information on the in vivo role of CXCL10 and IL\u20108 in HIV\u20101 transmission and its modulation by NG\u2010secreted proteins like IL\u20101\u03b2. There has already been some work which has shown that NG infection in HIV\u20101\u2010infected humanized mouse increases HIV\u20101 shedding in the genitalia.62\n",
