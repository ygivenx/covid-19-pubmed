            "text": "The role of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in autoimmune and pathogen-induced immune responses has been studied intensively during recent years. An important tool was provided by the discovery of the transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) as a marker for Tregs and their suppressive activity [1], [2], [3], [4]. During acute viral infections depletion of Tregs was found to prevent the development of exhausted T cells and to improve the immune response. In addition, transient depletion of Tregs in several persistent viral infections led to reactivation of virus-specific T cells and reduction of the virus load [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The important protective role of Tregs against an overshooting immune response in the CNS became obvious in animal models of stroke and experimental autoimmune encephalitis [10], [11], and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated neuro-degeneration, where they reduce astrogliosis and microglia-mediated inflammation [12]. Interestingly, some viruses even developed the strategy to support the expansion of Tregs in order to suppress anti-viral cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses and to limit viral immunopathogenesis [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Defects in regulation of numbers or the activity of Tregs are also involved in a number of human autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis [19].",

            "text": "Viral infections of the brain mostly represent clinically important, often life-threatening complications of systemic viral infections. For example, after acute measles, CNS complications may occur early as acute post-infectious encephalitis, or after years of viral persistence as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Epidemiological studies indicated that the primary MV infection of SSPE patients takes place predominantly below the age of two years, when the immune system of the host is still immature and residual maternal antibodies may be absent or not sufficient for complete virus neutralization [20], [21]. For intracerebral MV infection of mice, a transgenic human receptor for MV is not necessarily required, and various infection models exist depending on the age of the mice, the virus strain, and the infectious dose [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. As found in genetically unmodified and MV-receptor transgenic mice, T cells and IFN-\u03b3 have a critical role for protection and clearance of virus from the brain [27], [28], [29], [30]. Transient immunosuppression during MV-infection enhanced virus replication and facilitated persistence [31]. After intranasal infection of MV-receptor CD150-transgenic mice, a specific antiviral cellular immune response including an increased proportion of Foxp3+ Tregs in the spleen was observed [32]. Although the presence and activity of Tregs has been demonstrated, their actual role in viral immunosuppression or immunopathogenesis in the brain remains to be elucidated.",

The fraction of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells of all lymphocytes was determined to be 1.5\u20133% in the spleen and 4\u20136% in LN (Fig. 1 A, B) with no significant difference between infected and control animals. This corresponds to a total number of Tregs of approximately 1\u00d7106 in the spleen and 2\u00d7105 in the prepared LN at day 28 post infection. Only a small statistically not significant number of Foxp3+ T cells was detected in the brain, irrespective of the infection (data not shown). To obtain statistically significant results and to reduce standard errors caused by the staining procedure, we used DEREG mice, which express GFP in Foxp3+ cells. After infection of these mice with rMV (not expressing GFP), a small but significant number of GFP+ cells, approximately 800 per brain, was detected in the brains, whereas almost no GFP+ cells were detected in controls (Fig. 1 C; n = 3, P<0.05, two way ANOVA).",

The proportion of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs increased in the spleen and lymph nodes approximately 2-fold (Fig. 2 A; n = 4; P<0.01).

Under these conditions the total number of lymphocytes increased significantly after D665 treatment in spleen and LN, but not in the brain (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, the proportion of Foxp3+ Tregs increased significantly (approximately 2-fold, P<0.01) in spleen in LN (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, histological analyzes revealed that the extent of the viral infection increased considerably after D665 treatment. Large clusters and groups of bright GFP-positive (directly reflecting virus replication) infected neurons emerged in the brains of these mice (Fig. 3 A). This was in striking contrast to the brains of untreated mice at 28 dpi, which contain only a limited number of infected neurons (Fig. 3 B). It is also strikingly different from brains at 14 dpi, when the treatment with D665 begins. At this time point areas with weak (vanishing) GFP expression are observed, that represent areas from which virus is being eliminated (Fig. 3 C). The quantification demonstrated approximately 100-fold more infected cells per brain in D665-treated animals in comparison to control animals at 28 dpi (Fig. 3 D, compare lanes 3 and 5; differences were highly significant: P<0.0001). Two weeks later, at 42 dpi, the number of infected cells was reduced, but still higher than in control animals (Fig. 3 D, compare lanes 4 and 6). The data indicate that CD28-mediated expansion of Tregs in the periphery during the persistent phase of the viral infection induced a transient release of the viral infection from immunological control resulting in a dramatic increase of virus replication and spread in the CNS.",

In these mice, the viral infection was again quantified histologically in subsequent brain slices through the complete cerebrum as described earlier [33]. Treg depletion in DEREG\u2212/+ mice (compared to DT-treated DEREG\u2212/\u2212 mice as control animals) led to a significant reduction of the number of infected neurons from brains of persistently infected animals (n = 6, P = 0.0098; Fig. 4 C).",

MV-specific CD8+ T cells were then identified by flow cytometry using MHC class I (H-2Db) pentamers loaded with the most effective peptide MV-H22\u201330. The percentages of DbMV-H22\u201330-specific CD8+ T cells in spleen, LN, and the brain were determined after 3, 7, 10, 14 and 28 days post infection. Considerable proportions of DbMV-H22\u201330-pentamer-positive CD8+ T cells were detected in the brain at 7, 10, 14, and 28 dpi (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, high percentages of DbMV-H22\u201330-specific CD8+ T cells are present in the brain during the persistent phase of the infection (at 28 dpi approximately 18% of all CD8+ T lymphocytes). Mock-treated animals (i.c. PBS injection; ctrl) did not contain virus-specific CD8+ T cells. After treatment of DEREG mice with DT, the number of Tregs decreased by approximately 95%, while the number of CD8+ T cells in brains slightly increased (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, after depletion of Tregs, the fraction and absolute number of DbMV-H22\u201330-specific CD8+ T cells increased from 2,000 to 8,000 cells per brain, or 5% to 23% of CD8+ T cells (n = 3, P = 0,05; Fig. 5 C).

These findings suggest that only very few Tregs, if any at all, are required within the brain for the regulation of effector immune cells, and that this regulation predominantly takes place in secondary lymphoid organs. Sellin et al. observed an increase of Foxp3+ Tregs as a consequence of MV infection of CD150-transgenic mice in spleen and brain [32], which suggests that also the MV-infection itself supports the expansion and migration of Tregs, and that these infection-induced Tregs may be part of the multifactorial MV-induced immunosuppression [3], [4]. Tregs can restrain effector T cell responses through the production of immunomodulatory cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL-10, and IL-35, expression of inhibitory ligands, such as CTLA-4 and LAG-3, cytokine consumption, and direct cytolysis. It remains to be elucidated which of these mechanisms are involved in the persistent brain infection with MV.",

Using primary human lymphocytes, in vitro experiments demonstrated that CD8+ T lymphocytes control the dissemination of MV [39]. In resistant mouse strains the depletion of the CD4+ T cell subset by monoclonal antibodies led to a breakdown of resistance to the infection, whereas depletion of CD8+ T cells had no effect [23], [40]. In TAP-transporter deficient mice, which cannot present antigen on MHC class I molecules, MV was found to spread more transneuronally than in brains of normal mice [41]. These findings indicated that infected neurons are target cells of CD8+ lymphocytes, and that brain infections to some extent can be inhibited by CTL activity. Further investigations revealed that CD4+ T cells are able to protect either alone (in resistant mouse strains), or through cooperation with CD8+ T cells (in mice with intermediate susceptibility), and that CD8+ T cells are able to protect alone after immunization of the mice [42], [43]. Using CD46-transgenic Rag-deficient mice, adoptive transfer of lymphocytes revealed that the combined activity of CD4+ T lymphocytes with CD8+ T cells or B cells is required to control the intracerebral infection [44]. Thus, most findings support the view that CD8+ T cells play an important role in the control of transneuronal virus spread, and our findings suggest that MV-specific CD8+ T cells are involved in maintaining the steady state and control of infection during the persistent phase of CNS infection.",
