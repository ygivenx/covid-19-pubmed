            "text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that generally cause respiratory or intestinal infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs. Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) have been classified into two biotypes, comprising the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The widely accepted theory in vitro is that FIPV arises by mutation of parental FECV in the gastrointestinal tract of infected cats, then systemically spreads and causes FIP that is fatal in cats [1,2]. Although the mutation sites are not fully understood, some accessory genes are candidates for the site of the critical mutations responsible for FIP [3,4]. Approximately 80 % of all purebred cats are infected with feline coronavirus and among these, 5-12 % develop the classical symptoms of effusive/wet FIP, the non-effusive/dry form of FIP, or a combination of the two [5].",

            "text": "Investigators have reported that the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) can suppress the genomic replication and transcription of several viruses [8-11]. Cyclophilins (CyP) are cellular factors with high affinity for CsA [12] and comprise a family of cellular peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) that catalyze the cis-trans interconversion of the amino-terminal of peptide bonds to proline residues, thus facilitating changes in protein conformation as a chaperone protein [13]. Cyclosporin A blocks both the enzymatic activities of CyP that lead to the calcineurin (CN)-NF-AT and P-glycoprotein pathways. The capsid protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) possesses a cyclophilin A (CyPA) binding site for incorporation into the virion [14,15]. A CsA-induced reduction in CyPA inhibits transport of the reverse-transcribed viral genome to the nucleus [16]. Cyclophilin B (CyPB) is another target of CsA that promotes hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by regulating the RNA-binding ability of the HCV NS5B protein. In addition, CyPA facilitates mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) replication and CyPB is required for the infectious entry of human papillomavirus type 16.",

The results of the dual-luciferase assay showed that none of these factors significantly affected luciferase activities at 48 h after transfection. These results indicate that fcwf-4 cells are unresponsive, even to interferon \u03b1 (Figure 4A). Consequently, the action of CsA on intracellular FIPV replication does not involve the activation of interferon-stimulated genes on fcwf-4 cells. Moreover, to evaluate the effects of CsA and FK506 on the calcineurin-NF-AT pathway in fcwf-4 cells, the NF-AT luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL4.30 [luc2P/NFAT-RE/Hygro] and pRL-SV40 as a normalization-control plasmid were transfected into fcwf-4 cells that had been incubated with CsA or FK506. Neither CsA nor FK506 affected NF-AT luciferase activities in fcwf-4 cells (Figure 4B). These findings show that CsA does not influence the NF-AT pathway in fcwf-4 cells and that the inhibition of FIPV RNA replication by CsA is independent of the calcineurin NF-AT pathway.",

            "text": "We discovered that CsA inhibits intracellular FIPV replication in vitro. The results of qRT-PCR and Western blotting showed that viral proliferation was strikingly inhibited at CsA concentrations between 0.16 and 10 \u03bcM. The results of cell viability assays showed that 10 \u03bcM CsA was slightly cytotoxic. The inhibitory effects at this concentration should therefore be considered in the light of cytotoxicity. In contrast, immunosuppressive FK506 did not inhibit FIPV replication except at 10 \u03bcM according to the qRT-PCR findings. However, the inhibitory effects of 0.08 - 10 \u03bcM FK506 did not significantly differ on Western blots and the number of plaques did not significantly differ within the same concentration range of FK506. These findings might be related to the difference of the analytical detection sensitivity between qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. Cyclosporin A binds cyclophilins, whereas FK506 binds cellular FKBP. Each complex independently inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin that mediates the NF-AT pathway, which is critical to the expression of cytokines and their receptors [12,17]. The results of NF-AT reporter assays indicate that neither CsA nor FK506 influenced NF-AT activities on fcwf-4 cells under our experimental conditions. Thus, the antiviral activity against FIPV is not involved in the suppression of gene responses regulated by NF-AT but instead is exerted through distinct mechanisms that are independent of FK506. Pfefferle et al. recently described that SARS-coronavirus NSP1 overexpression increases signaling through the NF-AT pathway and enhances the induction of interleukin 2 [18]. Our data were somewhat inconsistent with these findings. The discrepancy might be explained in part by the fact that their experimental system included the addition of 13-O-Acetylphorbol 12-myristate (PMA) and ionomycin to the culture medium. Further knockdown studies of the NF-AT gene would clarify its role in FIPV proliferation. Furthermore, IFN\u03b1 did not stimulate ISRE-promoter activities in fcwf-4 cells under these conditions. These data suggest that the action of CsA on the intracellular replication of FIPV is independent of the IFN pathway. This cell line might not be responsive to IFN\u03b1 and would thus be useful for isolating feline coronavirus.",

Surface plasmon resonance technology and bioinformatics tools have found that the SARS coronavirus N protein binds to CyPA [26-28]. Therefore, the N protein of FIPV probably binds to CyP proteins to regulate viral replication. The roles of CyP in virus replication and the inhibitory effect by CsA on HCV and several other viruses have been studied [22-25]. The proposed mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of CsA mainly involve CypA and CypB in virus replication [23,29,30]. Based on these earlier findings, we believe that interaction between the FIPV genome is likely or that viral and CyP proteins play critical roles in viral replication and transcription. Further studies are required to resolve which CyP is critical for viral replication and which viral protein is required to form replication complexes with CyP and/or other cellular proteins.",
