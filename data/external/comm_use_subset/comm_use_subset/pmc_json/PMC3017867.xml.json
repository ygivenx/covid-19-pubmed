However, the expense and time required for sequencing using high throughput methods such as 454 (Roche), Solexa (Illumina), or SOLiD (Life Technologies) can make these methods prohibitive for routine use, especially when the resources required for data processing and analysis are taken into account. Viruses at low concentration may be missed if coverage is insufficient, and host sequence may make up 90% or more of the reads [1]. At the other end of the cost spectrum, PCR assays are very fast and sensitive, but have limited capacity for multiplexing (to test for the presence of several organisms simultaneously). They are also intolerant of primer-target mismatches; this is an advantage for detecting a microbe whose sequence is precisely known, but a great disadvantage for discovery of novel species, or for detecting variant strains of a known species.",

Arrays can be designed with a combination of detection and discovery probes, which respectively target species-specific regions (for precise characterization of known pathogens), or more conserved regions (to enable detection of novel organisms with some homology to previously sequenced organisms). Compared to sequencing, microarray analysis has the disadvantage that probes designed from known sequences are unlikely to detect truly novel organisms lacking homology to those sequences. However, microbial genomes are difficult and time-consuming to characterize when they have no similarity to known sequences, so the ability of sequencing to identify novel genomes has limited practical benefit in a rapid diagnostic context.",

They may thus be used to guide the selection of a subset of samples for further analysis by sequencing. Arrays can also be applied to study clinical samples for which PCR diagnostics have been uninformative. Often, the cause of a clinically severe infection is unknown, complicating the decision of whether to treat with antibiotics, antivirals, or other therapies. With optimization, and sufficiently high pathogen titers, we have successfully generated array results in as little as 2 hours (unpublished data). Moreover, arrays can assist in uncovering co-infections with more than one organism. Microbial detection arrays can also be used to check isolate stocks and vaccines for adventitious contaminants [9]. Finally, arrays can be used to assess the complexity of a metagenomic sample to determine the desired depth for sequencing, potentially saving costs on low complexity samples. Microarrays may reveal greater diversity in complex environmental samples than sequencing of a typical sized clone library [10]. Until the processing time and cost of high throughput sequencing (including data analysis) decreases enough to be feasible for large numbers of samples at sufficient depth, microarrays will continue to be a valuable tool.",

Bacterial, fungal and protozoan probes were exclusively designed against variable segments of rRNA genes (16S for bacteria, 18S for eukaryotes), flanked by highly conserved regions, so that the target regions could be amplified with a small number of specific PCR primers.

The outcome variables in the likelihood model are the positive signal probabilities for each probe, given the presence of a particular combination of targets in the sample.

A vertical dashed line is drawn at the 99th percentile threshold intensity. Log2 intensities for target-specific probes either cluster with the control and nonspecific probes (when they have low BLAST scores, usually), or approach the maximum possible value (16). This occurs because detection array probes are designed for high sensitivity to low target concentrations, so that probe intensities approach the saturation level whenever a probe has significant similarity to a target in the sample.

One measure of the complexity of a probe sequence is the entropy of its trimer frequency distribution, which we compute as described in Methods. To study whether the sequence entropy could be used as a predictor of nonspecific hybridization, we selected data from nine MDA v2 arrays for which all sample components had known genome sequences. We selected probes with no BLAST hits to any of the known targets, grouped them by entropy into equal sized bins, computed the positive signal frequency (the fraction of probes with positive signals), converted the frequency to a log-odds value, and plotted the log-odds against the trimer entropy, as shown in Figure 3. We also fit a logistic regression model for the probe signal as a function of entropy; a dashed line with the resulting slope and intercept is shown in the plot. The figure shows that the trimer entropy is an excellent predictor of the non-specific positive signal probability, and that probes with low entropy are more likely to give positive signals regardless of the target sequence.",

We tested all combinations of up to three covariates, using logistic regression to fit models to data from samples containing known targets, and performed leave-one-out validation to find the combination with the strongest predictive value.

We did note significant differences between sticky and non-sticky probes in the distributions of trimer entropy and hybridization free energy; sticky probes had smaller entropies (mean 4.6 vs 4.8 bits, p = 7.5 \u00d7 10 -14) and more negative free energies (mean -70.5 vs -66.8 kcal/mol, p = 3.8 \u00d7 10 -13) compared to 1755 non-sticky probes detected in 11 or fewer samples.

We expect that this pattern could arise in cases where a novel unsequenced isolate from the genus is present, in cases where conservation at the genus level is sufficiently high that the conserved probes do not provide species discrimination, or when multiple related organisms are present. Since the probes were selected from conserved regions within a family, the array was not designed for stringent species or strain discrimination. In sample 2_3 (Figure 10) we saw a strong signal for the presence of chicken anemia virus which was confirmed by PCR. This circovirus infects chickens, pointing to a dietary influence on the components of this human fecal sample. It is similar to the recently discovered and widespread human TT virus and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) [21]. Other studies have also found viruses from food in fecal samples [22]. Phage are also commonly detected in feces, particularly when sample preparation enriches for phage, for example, by purification in a cesium chloride gradient [23]. We did not do any gradient purification for phage enrichment, and although we detected more signals from bacteria than from the bacteriophage that infect those bacteria, we did detect signals for Staphylococcus aureus phage as the viral component of sample 2_4, as well as signals that its host bacteria was present (Figure 11).",

Significance values are assigned to the correlation scores by comparing them against an empirical distribution derived from over 1,000 array experiments. To handle samples that may contain a mixture of organisms, there is an iterative version of E-Predict, which, after identifying the most likely target on an array, sets the intensities of the probes matching the target to zero, computes new correlation coefficients, and repeats the identification process. Since it requires a corpus of data from previous experiments with the same array design, E-Predict cannot be applied to new, prototype array designs. E-Predict also has limited applicability to complex samples, in which several closely related strains of the same species may be present.",

The parameters of the distribution are inferred from the intensities of all probes on the array, under the assumption (usually justified) that only a small fraction of probes will hybridize to the target on the array. Probes are categorized as positive or negative by comparing their p-values against a fixed threshold. The p-values for the positive probes associated with each taxon are then multiplied, and an aggregate p-value computed for the product, using the method of Bailey [25]. Finally, candidate taxa are ranked by the aggregate p-value. The GreeneLAMP method depends heavily on the assumption that probe intensities are independent measurements of target genome abundances, which is not always justified. An iterative version of the method has not been reported to date; this makes it inappropriate for identifying mixtures of organisms in a sample, since the output of the algorithm is a single ranked list of taxa",

In cases where a sample contains an organism that has not been sequenced (or whose sequence is not in our analysis database), but is sufficiently similar to other sequenced microbes, the analysis will identify multiple related organisms most similar to the one in the sample. Similar results will be seen when the sample DNA is degraded or low in concentration, so the analysis cannot determine that a novel or unsequenced organism is present. Therefore, users of the MDA will need to interpret the data in the context of what else is known about the sample, to determine whether the predicted organisms are exact matches to known species or are novel but with some similarity to other sequenced microbes. Highly novel targets with no similarity to genomes in the database or probes on the array will not be detected. The failure of the MDA to detect VSV NJ in pure culture illustrates this well, and highlights a shortcoming of our approach to use only complete genomes to design the array. Future versions of the array will include all available sequence data, including partial sequences and gene fragments, for species lacking complete genomes. Modified statistical algorithms will then be required to deal with sequence length bias when partial genomes are included in the database. Most importantly, as new sequence data becomes available from newly discovered or newly sequenced organisms, the MDA must be updated with probes to detect them. We are currently designing Version 3 of the MDA to address these issues, probing both partial and complete bacterial and viral sequences, as well as fungi and some protozoa.",

Therefore, for each target family we eliminated regions with perfect matches to sequences outside the target family. Using the suffix array software Vmatch [26], perfect match subsequences of at least 17 nt long present in non-target viral families or 25 nt long present in the human genome or nontarget bacterial families were eliminated from consideration as possible probe subsequences.

Desirable range for these parameters was 50 \u2264 length \u2264 66, Tm\u226580\u00b0C, 25% \u2264 GC% \u2264 75%, \u0394Ghomodimer = \u0394G of homodimer formation > 15 kcal/mol, \u0394Ghairpin = \u0394G of hairpin formation > -11 kcal/mol, and \u0394Gadjusted = \u0394Gcomplement - 1.45 \u0394Ghairpin - 0.33 \u0394Ghomodimer \u2264 -52 kcal/mol. For the v2 array design, which includes bacterial probes, an additional minimum sequence complexity constraint was enforced, requiring a trimer frequency entropy of at least 4.5 (calculation described below). If fewer than a minimum number of candidate probes per target sequence passed all the criteria, then those criteria were relaxed to allow a sufficient number of probes per target. To relax the criteria, first candidates that passed the Primer3 criteria but failed the Unafold filters were allowed. If no candidates passed the Primer3 criteria, then regions passing the target-specificity (e.g. family specific) and minimum length constraints were allowed. From these candidates, we selected probes in decreasing order of the number of targets represented by that probe (i.e. probes detecting more targets in the family were chosen preferentially over those that detected fewer targets in the family), where a target was considered to be represented if a probe matched it with at least 85% sequence similarity over the total probe length, and a perfectly matching subsequence of at least 29 contiguous bases spanned the middle of the probe. For probes that tied in the number of targets represented, a secondary ranking was used to favor probes most dispersed across the target from those probes which had already been selected to represent that target. The probe with the same conservation rank that occurred at the farthest distance from any probe already selected from the target sequence was the next probe to be chosen to represent that target.",
