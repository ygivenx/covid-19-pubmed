In a 2001 risk assessment, it was estimated that 75% of the emerging pathogens were zoonotic [1]. Other studies report that 60 to 70% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) events in humans are of animal origin [2, 3]. The rising number of emerging zoonoses may be driven by \u201cmodernization of farming practices, particularly in the developing world, habitat destruction, human encroachment and climate change\u201d [3] to support a growing population [4]. This phenomenon holds true in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries where 70% of the public health emergencies in the Americas reported to the WHO from 2007 to 2008 were classified as zoonoses or communicable diseases common to humans and animals [5].",

Due to the still significant number of individuals living in extreme poverty in LAC countries (11.5% according to recent World Bank figures [8]) a focus on endemic zoonoses is required. The combined burden of NTDs likely exceeds that from malaria, tuberculosis, and possibly HIV in LAC countries [9].",

Although not presented here, individual countries and Ministries can be profiled to help identify potential vulnerable hot-spots that warrant technical cooperation from neighboring countries and international agencies. Regional and country-specific profiles allow comparisons with the countries responses to the annual IHR Core Capacity Implementation Survey. In 2013, 97% of the countries within the Americas region reported coordination within government for the detection and response to zoonotic events, and 97% had functional mechanisms for collaboration between animal and human health units such as intersectoral surveillance units and laboratories [22]. These compare with the results of the present survey where Ministries were asked to rank the relationship with their counterparts. None of the Ministries ranked their collaboration with the other Ministry as non-existent. In fact, the majority of Ministries ranked the collaboration as very or overall productive (69%). Yet, many Ministries suggested improvements through regular meetings, formalized MoUs, and data sharing. The latter entails a highly evolved relationship and well developed processes between parties and is uncommon, as reported by Vrbova et al. [23] who found that only 19% of the surveillance systems for emerging zoonoses considered both human and animal data. On a related topic, albeit less demanding of sophisticated structures and processes to support useful data sharing, the 2013 IHR Core Capacity Implementation survey reported that 80% of countries in the Americas had a timely and systematic exchange of information between the animal and human sectors [22]. Because so few MAgs have a dedicated zoonoses group (20%), the collection and sharing of data beneficial to both parties is likely to remain a challenge. For emerging zoonoses, given the low proportion of respondents that replied that they had an MoU with their counterpart (Fig 6), opportunities to improve this specific capacity appear possible. This is likely to hold true only for those zoonoses that have both a significant public health and an economic impact (e.g. BSE, AI). For other conditions, MoH may not perceive much benefit in establishing an MoU with MAgs, due to the little involvement of the latter in the control of zoonoses, e.g leptospirosis.",

A possible explanation is that Chikungunya response plans could be embedded within the response plans of other arboviruses.

            "text": "While there exists a number of supra-national initiatives targeted at, mostly endemic, specific zoonoses, e.g. canine rabies and cystic hydatidosis [25, 26], the Region does not possess an overarching strategy to, among other objectives, realize the potential benefits of integrating shared resources across vertical zoonoses programmes. Such integration would lead to improved control and eradication programmes as well as conservation of resources. Numerous activities, some of them captured by our survey, e.g. a regional report on zoonoses and the development of regional mechanisms to manage emerging zoonoses, would be better delivered through such an overarching strategy. The evidence captured here will be used to inform PAHO\u2019s regional zoonoses strategy, which will, as part of a One Health vision, constitute an important mechanism to support the organization\u2019s commitment towards the Development Goals [27]. This was the theme of the recent 17th Inter-Ministerial Meeting of Health and Agriculture Ministries (RIMSA in Spanish) held in Asuncion, Paraguay in July 2016 [28].",
