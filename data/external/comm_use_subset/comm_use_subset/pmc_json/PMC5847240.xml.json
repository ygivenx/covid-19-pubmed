            "text": "Vaccination campaigns with sufficiently high efficacy and coverage can ideally achieve herd immunity in the population. Herd immunity emerges when the indirect protection of vaccination reduces the per-case expected number of onward infections in a population (i.e., the effective reproductive number, Re) below one\u2014whether these onward infections are direct person-to-person or indirect environmental transmission pathways.[1\u20133] While the balance between these direct and indirect pathways will depend on the setting, the role of both pathways had been described for cholera[4] and utilized in modeling literature.[5\u20137] Herd immunity is not permanent, however, and is expected to wane over time via short-lived vaccine efficacy and an influx of susceptible, unvaccinated individuals. Due to a reliable efficacy profile and high attainable coverage, killed oral cholera vaccines (kOCV) can generate powerful herd protection effects.[8,9] In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a kOCV stockpile to facilitate vaccine usage in three settings: (1) humanitarian crises at high risk of cholera importation and transmission; (2) high-endemicity \u201chot spots\u201d; and (3) cholera outbreaks.[10] As the stockpile approaches its fifth year, evaluation of its management must address uncertainties in sustainability and long-term strategy, particularly regarding the duration of herd immunity (DHI) in these three settings.",

However, the relative contributions of these factors and their implications for vaccination strategy in the future are not clear.",

When Re > 1, the final epidemic size tends to follow a bimodal distribution with a probability of sporadic die-out and a probability of a large epidemic. Using a recent method for computing epidemic final size distributions,[30] we find the threshold of 10 cases is a reasonable cutoff size such that a large outbreak is henceforth very likely for sizeable values of Re (S2 Fig). We therefore define an outbreak as more than 10 cases and, by assuming a Poisson distribution of secondary infections (mean = Re), we can calculate the probability of an outbreak of more than y cases initiated by a single infectious case using the Borel-Tanner distribution:[31,32]\nPr(Y>y)=1-\u2211i=1y1(i-1)!ii-2Rei-1e-iRe.(3)",

We compare this scenario with counterfactual scenarios that eliminate at least one of these drivers and will therefore increase DHI. We constructed a composite counterfactual scenario in which: the birth/death rate was set to zero; vaccine efficacy was held constant at its maximum value (70.3%) for all time since vaccination; the camp resettlement rate was set to zero; and the population size was held constant at approximately the level observed during the outbreak (100,000). To isolate the impact of each driver of waning herd immunity, we ran simulations where one driver is set to the \u201cobserved\u201d condition while the other three drivers are set to their counterfactual condition to remove their influence (Table 1).",

If these vaccines are instead allotted on a daily basis through routine vaccination, DHI can be extended to 4.4 years (Fig 3B). However, recurring mass campaigns have diminishing returns per vaccine once herd immunity is achieved; meanwhile routine vaccination alone requires a long period of time to build up herd immunity. We therefore find that a blended \u201cMass and Maintain\u201d strategy that complements a single mass vaccination campaign with subsequent routine vaccination can maintain herd immunity longer than either strategy alone (Fig 3C), both for this example and for a wide range of settings with various migration rates and R0 values (S1 Table).",

In order to optimize pre-emptive kOCV impact in at-risk settings, there is a tradeoff between targeting low-mobility communities, where herd immunity may last for a long time but cholera introduction is rare, and high-mobility communities, where the opposite is expected. We find that communities with intermediate levels of migration may experience the largest vaccine-derived decrease in outbreak risk sparked by an imported case (Fig 4). For example, the migration rate recorded in the Bentiu PoC Camp in mid-2016 is near the optimal condition for maximizing the impact of a single mass vaccination campaign in the 4\u20136 year time horizon, assuming R0 = 1.5. If one is more interested in shorter time horizons since vaccination, the migration rate that maximizes vaccine impact favors mobile communities, similar to some urban areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[29] Sensitivity analyses suggest that intermediate mobility rates (e.g., between those observed in Dhaka and Calcutta) generally maximize vaccine impact, but the optimal migration rate is slower in settings that have a larger population size, a higher transmission potential (R0), or where a higher fraction of incoming migrants are infected (e.g., due to high-burden neighbors) (S5 Fig). Conversely, settings with small population size, low transmission potential, and whose migrants have a small probability of being infectious require very high migration rates in order to garner much baseline risk of cholera importation and outbreak.",

Using a \u201cMass and Maintain\u201d strategy including vaccination of 100% of individuals migrating into the camp after the second mass vaccination campaign, we estimate that only 52% of the population would have been susceptible on the date the first case was reported in the camp, which is low enough to generate herd immunity at the time (assuming R0 = 1.80)(S7 Fig).",

Therefore, disease re-emergence does not necessarily imply vaccine failure and can be avoided by data-driven revaccination strategies or by scaling-up long-term, broad-spectrum solutions while under the temporary cover of pathogen-specific vaccination.

For cholera specifically, there is a need for more research into cross-sectional markers of immunity which can inform risk profiling, revaccination timing, and, if stratified by age, the impact of mass vaccination.[44] A growing area of research focuses on the vaccine efficacy, and duration of protection, provided by a single kOCV dose.[5,45] Such work will help elucidate the relative merits of revaccination versus ongoing vaccination of new arrivals, for example.",

Human mobility and waning herd immunity are key considerations for when these urban populations should be revaccinated.",
