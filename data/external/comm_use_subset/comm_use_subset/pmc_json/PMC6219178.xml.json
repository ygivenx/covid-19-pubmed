In terms of the facemask wearing behaviors, we ask participants their facemask wearing behaviors when (a) in direct contact with people, (b) in crowded places such as shopping malls and the MTR. Participants will be informed that they will receive telephone calls in three randomly-selected days in the following 9 days asking them to report whether they have conducted the three influenza prevention behaviors.

            "text": "As a subtropical city, Hong Kong is located at the hypothetical epicenter of influenza pandemics [1, 3]. Despite the widespread influenza prevention measures suggested by various national and regional centers for disease control and prevention, relatively little research has been done to promote the adoption of preventive behaviors based on the psychosocial theories, as compared to the basic research for vaccination development and large-scale telephone interviews [14, 15]. Although vaccination is the most effective way of preventing influenza and much existing research focuses on the influence of psychosocial variables for vaccination rather than daily protective measures, effective daily preventive measures are also important [4]. Most importantly, even the vaccination is not able to guarantee full protection from influenza. Therefore, the current 24-month project aimed to develop a theory-based intervention materials for influenza prevention behaviors and examine its effectiveness in a sample of Hong Kong elderly people. Particular emphasis will be on the emphasis on both the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors [17].",
