Human cases of H7N9 have had a winter-spring peak with high mortality rates (range: 34\u201347%) in the past five annual epidemics2. After the first H7H9 epidemic began in March 2013, the number of cases gradually decreased during the next three epidemics cycles. However, the epidemic in 2016\u20132017 was worse with 766 laboratory-confirmed cases observed, which accounted for 49.1% (766/1560) of total H7N9 cases reported from 2013\u20132017. The median incubation period of H7N9 cases (from exposure to disease onset) was six days3 and the time from onset to disease confirmation was seven days4. After confirmation, the national health system receives the report from the hospital and then carries out measures to control epidemics. Therefore, traditional surveillance systems have a time lag of about two weeks. To prepare for the next epidemic and to provide a timely and effective response, a new approach for achieving near real-time detection of H7N9 cases and even prediction of emerging and spreading infectious outbreaks should be developed. Internet-based surveillance has the potential to achieve these goals.",

Internet-based disease surveillance has been widely suggested as a potential means to improve infectious disease surveillance6. Several infectious disease surveillance systems have been developed using internet search metrics to estimate incidence, including for influenza7,8 (Google Flu Trends) and dengue9 (Google Dengue Trends)10. Internet search metrics have also been applied in the monitoring and forecasting of emerging and re-emerging infections, including pandemic Ebola11 and Zika12, etc.",

Figure 5 demonstrates that the 0-week lagged BSI was the first level factor in the model, and the lagged WPI was the second level factor. When BSI for H7N9 at 0-week lag was >=11524, the average H7N9 cases increased by over 2.4-fold (26.8/11). The average H7N9 cases increased by over 2.6-fold (28.8/11) when WSI for H7N9 at -1-week lag was < 870.",

We\u2019ve also observed that the duration of the outbreak and the peak time of BSI and WPI for H7N9-related search terms preceded the occurrence of H7N9 cases in most epidemic waves, suggesting that BSI and WPI are potential indicators for the magnitude and duration of H7N9 epidemics. The reason why the beginning of the outbreak as indicated in BSI and WPI data during the fifth wave (2016\u20132017) did not occur before that H7N9 cases might be due to the over-reporting by the media or the fear-based search for the cases outbreak21. The positive and negative lags in the cross-correlation analyses implied that public opinion can also be affected by disease outbreaks. Therefore, a combination of search engine index and social media index has the potential to be used for both disease surveillance and public opinion monitoring22.",

The AUC of the ROC curve indicated that the sensitivity and specificity of BSI were higher than that of WPI. This may possibly be because compared with posting an opinion or discussion on the internet, more people may search for related information about the disease, which may enhance the sensitivity of the BSI. Other studies have used search engine data rather than social media data. However, our study also showed that data from social media, like Weibo, can improve the ability to predict H7N9 human infection. The regression tree model identified that the 0-week lagged BSI for H7N9 was a key predictor of the occurrence of H7N9 in China. A possible reason is that search engines are more popular and indispensable with the relatively unbiased user groups23. When the BSI volume is less than around 2000 searches per week, it can be defined as a non-epidemic, baseline period for H7N9 infection, more than 3000 is a warning period, and more than 10000 can be regarded as an outbreak period. This threshold provides an index reference to assess the potential risk of an outbreak based on to peoples\u2019 behaviour on the Internet and to predict the number of possible H7N9 cases.",

Most people who want to buy live poultry mainly search for \u201clive poultry\u201d instead of \u201cH7N9\u201d, which may make it an important indicator for big data analyses for avian influenza.

With these real-time data, there are at least two potential directions for future research28. First, we can track the information on a given disease as it spreads across the social network as represented by Weibo. One study has found that public concern and engagement in protective behaviours increased when the threat of the H1N1 outbreak increased and decreasing when the perceived risk declined29. Second, content analysis of social networks posts will enable researchers to analyse human attitudes or reactions towards specific health hazards30.

Second, the national geographical distribution of the WPI is not yet available, and it has not been included in this study. This study only describes the temporal and spatial consistency between H7N9 cases and the Internet search query results and explores their predictability. In the future, more use of visualization techniques to present the predictive model by using a variety of big data with verification set, such as an HTML document or Weibo thread or WeChat application, is warranted. This will largely increase the visibility of the study results and benefit a larger population of readers and researchers.

We used the H7N9 case number as the dependent variable, and BSI and WPI with the maximum cross-correlation coefficient as the independent variables. An autoregressive notation (p), a differencing notation (d) and a moving average notation (q) formed the multiplicative process of ARIMA as (p, d, q), and a seasonal autoregressive notation (p), a seasonal differencing notation (d) and a seasonal moving average notation (q) formed the multiplicative process of SARIMA as (p, d, q)34. A SARIMA model can be considered a good model if it has a large stationary R square (R2) value and a small Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).",
