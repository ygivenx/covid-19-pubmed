The genome of IBV contains at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) as follows: 5\u02b9-1a-1b-S (S1, S2)-3a-3b-3c (E)-M-5a-5b-N-Poly (A)-3\u02b9 [5]. The two overlapping ORFs of 1a and 1b at the 5\u02b9 end are encoded by Gene 1, which constitutes approximately two-thirds of the genome, and are translated as the large polyprotein 1ab that is associated with RNA replication and transcription. The other regions of the genome encode four main structural proteins (the glycosylation spike glycoprotein (S), the envelope protein (E), the membrane protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N)), as well as two accessory genes, 3 and 5, which express accessory proteins 3a and 3b, and 5a and 5b, respectively [6]. The spike protein of IBV is cleaved into S1 and S2 glycoproteins. The S1 subunit is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and carries serotype-specific antigenic determinants. The C-terminal portion of the S2 protein intercalates in the virus envelope and assists S1 protein anchoring in the membrane [7]. Both M and E proteins are membrane-associated proteins required for the formation of virus-like particles and virus budding [8]. N protein is associated with the RNA genome and forms the ribonucleoprotein [2].",

Multiple IBV serotypes have been identified worldwide and the number of emergent IBV antigenic variants is increasing [7, 10, 11]. Meanwhile, the little cross-protection between different variants and vaccine has led to the outbreaks of infectious bronchitis in vaccinated chicken flocks [11\u201313]. Genomic recombination has been shown to occur at high frequency in coronaviruses, particularly IBV [14\u201317], also potentially leading to outbreaks of disease. All of these findings suggest the importance in the investigation of new and emerging IBV isolates.",

Therefore, we monitored the clinical manifestations of infectious bronchitis among Chinese chicken flocks and isolated a number of strains affecting flocks from different regions. One such strain, strain GD, was isolated from the flock in Guangdong Province and the complete genome was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the genome sequence of strain GD with that of other IBV strains, including reference strains, vaccine strains, and other Chinese isolates reported recently. Recombination sites were analyzed to determine whether strain GD was a chimera. Our results provide insight into the current distribution of IBV genotypes across China and the molecular characteristics of prevalent strains. These findings may provide important theoretical basis and practical guidance for the effective vaccine strategies in prevention and control of IBV.",

One was between positions 87 and 88, the other two were between 119 and 120 (H120 aa numbering). The insertion positions were located in or near hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) and HVR2, the regions that had a close relationship with a neutralizing antibody. The insertion of glycine between positions 87 and 88 was also detected in strain TW2575/98 and TW1171/92 which were classified in TW-type but was not detected in other reference strains.

In this study, the S1 cleavage site of strain GD was R-R-F-R-R (Arg- Arg- Phe- Arg- Arg), which was commonly observed in recent Chinese isolates and was identical to the most of TW-type IBVs isolated in China mainland. However, it has been reported that the cleavage recognition site in the S1 protein was not associated with the pathogenicity of IBV [20, 21]. The S1 gene of strain GD was most closely related to TW-type strains due to the highest identity identified between strain GD and TW2575/98 (isolated in Taiwan). Previous studies suggested that only a few changes in the aa sequence of the S1 protein of IBV could lead to the emergence of a new serotype [22], suggesting that amino acid insertions and mutations in the S1 protein might lead to the changes of immunogenicity in strain GD, which make it possible to escape the immunization of current vaccine.

In addition, there was similar background between GD strain and a majority of the TW-type domestic IBVs, such as the similar days of the affected broilers, the morbidity and mortality rate. These results were in agreement with those of previous studies that reported an increasing number of TW-type strains isolated in southern China in recent years [24, 25, 31]. Taiwan is a location-independent island separated by a strait from mainland China, and no livestock trading occurred between these countries. The main reason for the emergence of IBV variants in Taiwan has been proposed to be the migration of birds [32]. Since the first TW-type domestic strain, CK/CH/LSD/05I, was isolated in Shandong Province, an increasing number of TW-type strains have been isolated in mainland China [33], as confirmed by our findings. Most of the TW-type strains were isolated from about 30-days-old broilers while few were from more than 200-days-old layer hens. Moreover, the majority of TW-type strains (thirty-one over forty-one) have been isolated in southern China, with only seven strains isolated in northeast China. Geographical factor is one of the factors affecting the evolution of IBVs. Northeast China is located further from Taiwan island than the southern. That may be the reason we can explain why most of the isolates are from in Southern China. Our findings indicated that mutations and/or recombination events were common among IBVs isolated in China. The increasing ratio of TW-type strains suggested that conventional vaccines such as H120 might not be effective in protecting poultry.",

RT was carried out using 4 \u03bcL of total RNA, 2 \u03bcL of dNTPs (2.5 mM), 1 \u03bcL of RNasin (50 U/\u03bcL), and M-MLV (10 U/\u03bcL, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. For PCR, 25 \u03bcL of 2 \u00d7 PCRmix (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) and 20 pmol of each primer were added to 100 ng of template cDNA in a total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcL. The reaction conditions were as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, annealing for 45 s (temperature depended on the primers), 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, with a final extension step of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplified sequences were purified using the AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction kit (Axygen, Union City, CA, USA), and the purified products were inserted into the pMD18-T vector (Promega). Nucleotide sequencing of the recombinant plasmids was performed by TsingKe Biological Technology (Beijing, China).",
