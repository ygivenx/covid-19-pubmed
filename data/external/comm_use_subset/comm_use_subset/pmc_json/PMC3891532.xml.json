In 1982, bovine torovirus (BToV) was first isolated from a case of neonatal calf diarrhea in the United States and BToV was reported to be related to calf diarrhea in experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves and under field conditions. Porcine torovirus is a member of the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales), and its genome organization is similar to other toroviruses, consisting of ~28000 nucleotides organized into five ORFs expressing a replicase polyprotein and four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) and nucleocapsid (N) [6\u20138]. Porcine torovirus has been reported in Canada, South Africa and European countries, Italy, Hungary, and in recent years also in Spain [5, 9, 10]. However, to our knowledge, detection of PToV in China has not been reported. In 2011 winter, there were epidemic outbreaks of diarrhea that occurred with high morbidity and mortality in China, which has caused great economic losses. Diarrhea samples were collected for examination of enteric pathogens, in which PToV was included. In this study, we reported the first detection of PToV in southwest China and analyzed the phylogenetic relationships between the Chinese PToV and PToV reference strains as well as other representative toroviruses. A survey for other enteric pathogens was also conducted and statistical analysis of the epidemiological study with regard to clinical signs (diarrhea) was performed to reveal any association of PToV infection with diarrhea in piglets.",

The supernatants were subsequently collected and subjected to RNA extraction. Total RNA of supernatants were extracted using TaKaRa RNAiso Reagent and dissolved in DEPC treated water, respectively. The strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase (RT) using TaKaRa reverse transcription system. A primer pair targeting the spike (S) protein gene was used for the detection of PToV. The PCR was performed at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. All specimens were also tested for the presence of PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus), PRV A\u2013C (porcine group A\u2013C rotaviruses), TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus), AV (astroviruses), MRV (mammalian orthoreovirus), calicivirus (PSaV (porcine sapovirus), and PNoV (porcine norovirus) in accordance with the methods in previous studies [11\u201316] and PKBV (porcine kobuvirus) by the RT-PCR method established by our own laboratory and the PCR program was performed as described above with slight modifications.

Those that shared the same sequence were neglected. Pairwise comparison of nucleotide sequences of the partial S gene confirmed that the strains are more closely related to the porcine torovirus. Comparison of the nucleotide (exclude the primer sequences) and deduced amino acid sequences of the fragment of the S gene of Chinese PToV strains showed that the Chinese PToV strains were highly conserved for the region, which had 90.2%\u201399.8% nucleotide and 93.7%\u201399.3 deduced amino acid identity with each other, and they formed a single lineage on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). The Chinese PToV strains were 90.9%\u201395.1% and 89.4%\u201396.5% identical to those porcine torovirus (AJ575372.1; GU196786.1) while only 38.3%\u201340.7% and 8.7%\u201310.8% to those of bovine torovirus. While, among the Chinese PToV strains, 6 strains clustered most closely with the the PToV Markelo/Netherlands strain, KC340955 clustered with GU196786. These results indicated that different PToV strains were circulating in China. Previous researches suggested that more than two different PToV strains could circulate simultaneously in an area; moreover individual animals could be infected by two strains during their productive life [5, 17].",

It was worth noting that two diarrhea samples were tested positive for PToV alone, and a previous study has reported a diarrhea sample tested positive for PToV alone when a survey for enteric pathogens in diarrheic pigs was carried out [20]. However, the impossibility of growing the virus in culture cells has precluded the development of PToV. We could not make the conclusion if there was any necessary connection between the two, or a relationship exists between PoTV and the other enteric pathogens identified. We could not ignore the importance of PToV and diagnosis of porcine diarrhea should include PToV examination. Further studies to reveal the epidemiological status of PToV infection in China are needed to be developed. In addition to investigating the molecular epidemics using RT-PCR, further immunological method should be established to detect serological prevelence of porcine torovirus in Chinese swine herds. Future researches will focus on the epidemiology and pathogenic potential of PoTV.",
