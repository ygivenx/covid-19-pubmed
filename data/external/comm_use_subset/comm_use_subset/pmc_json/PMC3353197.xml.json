            "text": "Avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), named as a Gallid herpesvirus 1, is a member of the Iltovirus genus, Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, and Herpesviridae family. ILTV has a linearized dsDNA genome of approximately 150 kb in size which contains unique long (UL) and unique short (US) sequences flanked by inverted repeat (IR) and terminal repeat (TR) sequences [1,2]. The genome encodes 80 predicted viral protein open reading frames (ORFs). ILTV infection causes respiratory disease symptoms in chickens, pheasants, partridges, and peafowl [3,4]. Clinical signs include extension of the neck, gasping, gurgling, rattling, and coughing of clotted blood [5]. ILTV usually causes a reduction in egg production and variable mortality ranging from 5 to 70%, and can cause severe economic losses in the poultry industry [6].",

In addition, cartonectin (an adipokine of the CTRP3 family) helps reduce inflammation by suppressing IL6 and TNF production and NF-\u03baB signaling [59-61]. IL6, one of several cytomegalovirus secreted cytokines, enhances the survival of endothelial cells by blocking caspase 3 and caspase 7-mediated apoptosis [62]. CTRP3 could also accelerate embryonic growth and may contribute to a high feed efficiency phenotype in broilers [63]. Thus, the continuous increase of CTRP3 expression from 2 to 4 dpi during ILTV vaccine infection suggests the suppression of cellular factors related to inflammation and the promotion of cell recovery after the initial cytopathic effect that was exhibited in embryonic lung cells on 1dpi.",

Similar differential expression levels for focus molecules in network #1 are shown at all four dpi during ILTV vaccine infection and the top functions related to genes in this network include free radical scavenging, lipid metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry. Several secreting proteins such as FIGF [c-fos induced growth factor; a.k.a vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D)], PDGFC (platelet derived growth factor C), TNFSF15 (tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15), and CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) in network #1 are closely associated with the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway [69-72]. Additional cellular factors, including MGAT3 (mannosyl glucosaminyltransferase 3), HS6ST1 (heparin sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 1), and CIRBP (cold inducible RNA binding protein), that activate ERK 1/2 by increased phosphorylation are also upregulated in vaccine ILTV infection [73-75]. These results indicate that the mitogenic signaling pathway may be activated by increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in vaccine ILTV infection, resulting in weak cytopathic effects that facilitate the recovery of cellular proliferation capabilities of embryonic lung cells during vaccine ILTV infection. In addition, several enzymatic antioxidants in lung cells that would reduce cellular oxidative stress included SOD3 (superoxide dismutase 3, extracellular), GPX7 (glutathione peroxidase 7), and GSTs (glutathione S tranferases; GST-A3, -T1, -A4) were also assigned to network #1. This up-regulation of these enzymatic antioxidants would serve to protect cells from oxidant-mediated cell death. These results concur with a previous report of enhanced endogenous antioxidant protection during vaccine ILTV infection and attenuation of cell death [76]. Focus molecules found in network #1 can be summarized by the following functions: stimulation of various secreting proteins, inhibition of the cell death pathway, and attenuation of oxidative stress.",

The expression and secretion of BMP2 was regulated by HIV proteins in differentiating mesenchymal stem cells [80]. Expression of BMP2 in both virulent and vaccine ILTV infections increased at 1dpi and the increased expression level in vaccine ILTV infection was maintained until 3dpi, while the expression in virulent ILTV was not changed at 3dpi (Figure 5).

NPY protects the nervous system from murine retrovirus-induced neurological disease [81]. The up-regulation of NPY was observed in both infection and reactivation of VZV from a latent infection in human sensory trigeminal and dorsal ganglia, which are both sensory neurons [82]. It suggests that the up-regulation of NPY in virulent ILTV infection at 3 dpi may facilitate the latent infection in the nervous system. In contrast, the continuous down-regulation of NPY in vaccine ILTV infection may delay the latent infection to protect the host from diseases.",

Unlike our previous research on virulent ILTV infection, the vaccine ILTV infection showed weak cytopathic effects, cellular morphology recovery after initial cytopathic effects were observed and very little cell death. Possible molecular interpretations confirmed the suppression of cell death and weak cytopathic effect production during vaccine ILTV infection. Four host cellular genes were significantly modulated by vaccine ILTV infection, and could represent important secreting regulators to protect cells from cytotoxic damages. Although host gene expression by vaccine ILTV infection was determined in a cell culture system and not by an in vivo vaccination study, the results in this study provide important insights into differential host cellular defense mechanisms by regulating host gene expression response of vaccine ILTV infection to compare those of virulent ILTV infection.",
