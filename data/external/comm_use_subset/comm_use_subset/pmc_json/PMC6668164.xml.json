In the largest of the contributing studies [2], no subgroups were identified who derived clinically relevant benefit from antibiotics [3]. Avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions is one of the key components of the UK\u2019s national action plan on tackling antimicrobial resistance [4, 5].",

Various strategies have been proposed in national guidelines including delayed prescribing [9] and wider use of the C-reactive protein (CRP) test [10] but have yet to have substantial impact. The symptoms of acute bronchitis are troublesome, and cough is known to persist for around 3 weeks on average [2, 11]. One alternative approach is to provide symptom relief, which in conjunction with a delayed prescription if effective may substantially reduce antibiotic uptake. The impact of effective alternative treatments for respiratory infections is likely to be in minimising unnecessarily severe or prolonged symptoms and avoiding side effects from unnecessary antibiotics; minimising the long-term public health risks of inappropriate antibiotics and providing a model for different management strategies for other respiratory tract infections (RTIs).",

            "text": "Pelargonium sidoides root extract EPs\u00ae7630 is widely available over the counter in several countries in Europe, Asia, and Central and South America as well as in Australia. A variety of potential mechanisms have been identified for EPs\u00ae7630 which provide a rational basis for its use, including moderate antiviral and antibacterial effects and the possession of immune-modulatory capabilities that are mainly mediated by the release of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 and nitric oxides, the stimulation of interferon-\u03b2, and an increase in natural killer cell activity [18\u201321]. Moreover, EPs\u00ae7630 has been shown to activate human monocytes, induce mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells, and specifically modulate their production capacity of mediators that are known to lead to an increase of acute phase protein production in the liver, neutrophil generation in the bone marrow, and the generation of adaptive T-helper 17 and T-helper 22 cells. An improved phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and intracellular killing by human peripheral blood phagocytes as well as an inhibition of group-A streptococci and host epithelia [19, 21] and an increase of stress resistance [22] was also shown. Pelargonium sidoides root extract EPs\u00ae7630 interferes with replication of seasonal influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H3N2), human coronavirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, and coxsackie virus, whilst no direct virucidal effect was observed [23]. Exertion of anti-influenza virus activity was also confirmed in an animal model [24]. The data available therefore constitute sufficient evidence to warrant undertaking a high-quality independent clinical trial of this herbal medicine.",
