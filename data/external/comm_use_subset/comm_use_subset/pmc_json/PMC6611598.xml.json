            "text": "EBOV enters host cells by binding to attachment factors such as lectins and TIM/TAM family members through interactions, respectively, with the viral glycoprotein (GP) and phospholipids in the viral envelope [3]. GP is a class I fusion protein present at the surface of the virion as a trimer of heterodimers, each comprised of two subunits linked by a disulfide bond: the highly glycosylated receptor-binding subunit (GP1) and the fusion subunit (GP2). After internalization through a macropinocytotic pathway [3,4], GP1 is cleaved at low pH by endosomal cysteine-proteases, namely cathepsins B and L, removing the mucin domain and glycan cap and producing a cleaved form of GP1 (~19 kDa) [5\u20137]. Then GP1 binds to its intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a cholesterol transporter located in late endosomes/lysosomes [8\u201310]. The utilization of intracellular viral receptors is a fairly new concept in virology, with all known filoviruses employing NPC1 and the arenavirus, Lassa virus (LASV), using Lamp1 [2,11\u201315]. While Lamp1 is thought to raise the pH-threshold for fusion [13,14], the exact role of NPC1 in EBOV entry is yet to be determined. It is postulated that after binding to NPC1, cathepsin-cleaved GP (GPcl) undergoes further conformational changes empowering GP2 to mediate fusion [16].",

            "text": "The factors needed to trigger the fusion activity of GPcl remain under debate. Early work showed that host cell entry mediated by GPcl remains sensitive to lysosomotropic agents and the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d [6]. These findings suggested that GPcl requires low pH and an additional activity inhibited by E64d, perhaps additional cathepsin cleavage, to trigger its fusion ability. Additional cell biological [17\u201320] and biochemical studies [21\u201324] supported this concept. Furthermore, findings stated in [10] suggested that low pH and engagement of the C-loop of NPC1, the binding domain for GPcl within NPC1, are not sufficient to trigger fusion. The endosomal two pore calcium channel 2 (TPC2) was subsequently identified as a late entry factor for EBOV [25], but its exact role in fusion is not known. In contrast to the literature cited above suggesting needs for low pH, NPC1, and an additional factor(s) to support GPcl-mediated fusion, Markosyan et al. [26] proposed that binding to NPC1 is sufficient to induce GPcl to induce fusion, even at neutral pH.",

            "text": "In the present study, we revisited the question of how the cleaved form of EBOV GP (GPcl) is triggered for fusion by testing the roles of NPC1, low pH, and other potential triggering factors. The assays employed included highly sensitive luciferase-based cell-cell and pseudovirus-cell fusion assays, as well as a flow cytometric-based assay for cell-cell hemifusion. Our findings suggest that neither the NPC1-C-loop nor full-length NPC1 are sufficient to trigger significant fusion at any pH tested. Even the presence of additional factors including a reducing agent, a negatively charged lipid abundant in late endosomes/lysosomes, cathepsins, or the cations Ca++ and K+ did not elicit detectable fusion. Taken together, our results suggest that cathepsin primed EBOV-GP requires one or more factors in addition to NPC1 and low pH to mediate a fusion reaction sufficiently robust to allow entry of the EBOV genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication.",

For this assay, effector cells expressing GPcl (S1A Fig) were cocultured with target cells expressing NPC1 C-loop at the cell surface (S1B Fig). For effector cells, to avoid the toxicity of thermolysin treatment of cells expressing full-length EBOV-GP (to generate 19 kDa GP), we co-expressed DNAs encoding EBOV GP with a furin cleavage site at positions 203\u2013206 and furin, yielding 21 kDa GP, a form capable of binding the C-Loop [18,26,31] (also see S2A Fig). Effector and target cells each additionally expressed one half of a split luciferase/split GFP construct (DSP1-7 and DSP8-11, respectively). If fusion occurs, the resulting syncytia express luciferase and GFP [28]. Effector cells expressing GP from Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) were used as a positive control. As seen in Fig 1 (panel A), after a pulse at pH 4.5, 5.0, 5.7, or 7.2, no cell-cell fusion (content mixing) was observed for cells expressing EBOV-21K-GP, with target cells that either did or did not express C-loop at their surface; the observed luciferase activity levels were comparable to those seen with effector cells harboring no GP. In contrast, robust luciferase signals indicative of CCF were observed for cells expressing LCMV-GP at pH 4.5 and 5.0 with target cells that did or did not express NPC1 C-loop (Fig 1A), consistent with the pH requirements for LCMV GP-mediated fusion [13,32].

Binding was conducted at 4\u00b0C to prevent pseudovirus internalization and after the pH pulse, the cells were maintained in NH4Cl, a lysosomotropic weak base that raises endosomal pH, to prevent fusion that might occur through the normal endocytic route. For these tests we used VSV pseudoviruses expressing 19 kDa EBOV GP, generated by thermolysin cleavage of pseudoviruses expressing full-length GP, as well as ones bearing 21 kDa EBOV GP generated with the furin site mutant described above (S1C Fig).

Since the findings presented thus far suggested that NPC1 C-Loop and low pH are not sufficient for EBOV-GPcl to mediate complete fusion (leading to content mixing), we next asked whether they are sufficient to mediate an earlier stage, hemifusion. To do this we used the lipid mixing assay employed by Markosyan et al [26], in which effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl and labeled with the fluorescent lipid probe DiO are mixed with target cells expressing NPC1 C-loop and labeled with the fluorescent lipid probe DiI. After coculturing and exposure to different pH buffers, the cells are analyzed for hemifusion between effector and target cells by flow cytometry [26]. For our analysis the cell population that had undergone lipid mixing was distinguished from unfused cell pairs by the higher DiI intensity of (hemi)fused cells due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer between DiO and DiI, leading to an enhancement of DiI fluorescence in cells undergoing lipid mixing [32] (S3 Fig). As seen in Fig 1B, whereas a lipid mixing signal was detected with effector cells expressing LCMV GP and treated at pH 5, no hemifusion signal above background was detected for effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl, whether the target cells did or did not express NPC1 C-Loop at their surface. And this is although the cells expressing EBOV-GPcl showed apparently increased binding to cells that expressed NPC1 C-loop, compared to ones that did not express NPC1 C-loop, at their surface (S3 Fig).",

Elevated temperatures also induced the EBOV GPcl ectodomain to bind to liposomes at low pH [23]. However, temperatures as high as 50\u00b0C failed to induce GPcl to mediate CCF to target cells expressing NPC1 C-Loop at any pH tested (Fig 3A). Next, we assessed the effects of the reducing agent TCEP, since reductases are present in late endosomes/lysosomes [36,37] and since 1\u20135 mM TCEP caused the ectodomain of EBOV-GPcl to bind to liposomes, an activity diminished with the fusion loop mutant, F535R [23]. However, as seen in Fig 3B, no CCF above background was seen with effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl in the presence of 5 mM TCEP at any pH tested. While elevated temperature and reducing agent appear sufficient to induce the isolated GPcl ectodomain to bind to liposomes [23], they are not sufficient to induce full fusion, supporting the notion that an additional factor(s) is (are) required.",

In addition, Gong et al. reported that the affinity of GPcl is ~10-fold higher to full length NPC1 than to the isolated NPC1 C-loop [47].",

While NPC1 is mainly found in late endosomes [17,48] cells may express some endogenous NPC1 at their surface (Fig 5A and 5B, gels of untransfected (-) target cells and control (C) target cell clones) (also see [26]). In a first set of experiments, we transiently overexpressed NPC1 by transfecting target cells with a plasmid encoding full length NPC1 cDNA under the control of a CMV promoter. Under these conditions, a substantial amount of NPC1 was found at the cell surface, as detected by cell surface biotinylation (Fig 5A, gel of transfected (+) target cells). Cells transiently expressing full length NPC1 at their surface were then tested as targets in the split luciferase CCF assay with effector cells expressing EBOV-GPcl at their surface (Fig 5A, gel of effector cells), as described above. However, as with its C-loop, full-length NPC1 did not elicit detectable content mixing CCF activity for EBOV-GPcl at any pH tested, while LCMV-GP, again, induced robust CCF at low pH (Fig 5A). As a further test we generated stable clones of HEK293T/17 cells that express significant levels of NPC1 at their surface (Fig 5B, gels of clones N4, N7). Consistent with the findings with transiently transfected cells (Fig 5A), GPcl-mediated fusion was not detected with target cells that stably express full length NPC1 at their surface (Fig 5B).",

After engaging attachment factors on the cell surface (which can differ on different cells), EBOV particles are engulfed by macropinocytosis and trafficked via early and late endosomes to an endocytic compartment referred to as a late endosome/lysosome (LE/Lys) [3,4,17\u201319,49]. En route the receptor binding subunit of the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) is cleaved by cathepsins B and L to generate a cleaved (~19 kDa) species [5,6] that binds to the C-Loop of Niemann-Pick-C1 (NPC1), the EBOV endosomal receptor [8\u201310]; fusion then ensues through acidic LE/Lys [18,19]. For most other enveloped viruses that enter cells through endosomes, even for Lassa virus, the second virus shown to use an intracellular/endosomal receptor [12,13], low pH is then sufficient to trigger conformational changes that elicit the fusion activity of the viral fusion GP [16]. The fusion GPs of SARS and MERS coronaviruses additionally require a (post receptor binding) endosomal proteolytic cleavage event [50\u201353].",

While findings stated in Miller et al. indicated that low pH did not trigger recombinant VSV particles bearing EBOV GPcl (the 19 kDa form generated by thermolysin cleavage) to fuse and thereby infect cells expressing NPC1-C-Loop at their surface [10], Markosyan et al [26] reported that NPC1 at cell surfaces is sufficient to mediate cell-cell fusion (CCF) with cells expressing EBOV GPcl (see below). Because of these conflicting conclusions we re-examined the sufficiency of NPC1 to trigger the fusion activity of EBOV GPcl. In the process, we also assessed the potential enhancing role of additional factors shown, as outlined in the Results section, to augment fusion of other endocytosed enveloped viruses [23,33\u201335,38,39,45,50,53]. Our findings are consistent with and extend the result stated by Miller et al. [10]. We found that cells expressing either NPC1-C-Loop or full length NPC1 at their surface did not serve as adequate targets for detectable fusion, at any pH tested, with effector cells or pseudovirus particles bearing EBOV GPcl (19 kDa or 21 kDa forms). Moreover, this apparent insufficiency was seen even if effector-target cell pairs were additionally exposed to elevated temperature, a reducing agent, Ca++, K+, the anionic lipid BMP, or cathepsins B and L.",

            "text": "Markosyan et al [26] monitored CCF between effector cells bearing EBOV GPcl (either the 19 kDa or 21 kDa form) and target cells bearing NPC1 by scoring mixing of fluorescent lipid dyes as well as a small (622 Dalton) aqueous content dye; they also queried electrical conductivity between effector-target cell pairs exposed to pH 5.7. They concluded that very small, non-expanding fusion pores formed at both neutral and (more quickly) low pH (optimally at pH 5.7). While we employed the delivery and expression of luciferase reporter plasmids as a (different, but highly sensitive) content mixing assay, we used the same lipid mixing assay as Markosyan et al., and as per Gomez-Icazbalceta et al. [32], gated out bound (adhered) but unfused cell pairs (S3 Fig). With these means of analysis we did not observe a detectable lipid mixing signal with effector cells bearing EBOV GPcl, at any pH tested, while lipid mixing was detected with effector cells bearing LCMV GP at pH 5. Our disparate lipid mixing results could be due to technical and analytical differences. Irrespectively, the small non-expanding fusion pores reported by Markosyan et al. [26] would likely not lead to productive viral infection, being too small to pass a viral nucleocapsid. Hence, we conclude that NPC1 and low pH are not sufficient to drive the fusion activity of EBOV GPcl. This conclusion is consistent with x-ray analysis of the GPcl-NPC1-C-loop complex, indicating that only small, but likely important, conformational changes occur when EBOV GPcl binds to NPC1-C-Loop at pH 5.5 (albeit as seen in crystals formed at 18\u00b0C). For example, there was no evidence that binding of NPC1 to EBOV GPcl (at low pH and 18\u00b0C) causes expulsion of the fusion loop from the body of the GPcl trimer [54].",

            "text": "Based on findings stated by Miller et al. [10] and presented in Figs 1, 2 and 5, we postulated that a factor(s) in addition to low pH and NPC1 is needed to elicit the fusion activity of EBOV GPcl. We therefore tested factors required for fusion or uncoating of other endocytosed enveloped viruses (Ca++, K+, BMP, proteases) [38,39,41,45,53], proposed for EBOV in particular (Ca++, additional cathepsin action, reducing agent) [6,25,55], and even the non-physiological condition of elevated temperature, which can substitute for biological viral fusion triggers [33\u201335]. However, none of these factors or treatments elicited detectable CCF between effector cells bearing EBOV GPcl and target cells bearing NPC1 or its C-Loop (at any pH tested), while robust CCF was consistently detected with effector cells bearing LCMV GP at low pH. Although we cannot rule out that one of the tested additional factors induced hemifusion or small non-expanding fusion pores, or that CCF would be observed with a combination of these factors, we favor the hypothesis that the fusion activity of EBOV GPcl requires NPC1, low pH and a yet to be identified, likely endosomal, factor. The initial observation indicating a need for an additional factor was that pseudovirus particles bearing 19 kDa EBOV GP are not infectious if target cells are pretreated with a lysosomotropic agent (which raises endosomal pH) or with the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d [6], findings that have been confirmed by others [20]. In this context it is interesting that Spence et al. [19] recently found, in live cell imaging studies employing VSV particles bearing EBOV GPcl, that the E64d-sensitive step follows hemifusion, i.e. is at the stage of fusion pore formation or particle uncoating. On the other hand, we have observed fusion of the isolated EBOV fusion loop [21,56] and of EBOV GP2 reconstituted into proteoliposomes [57] with liposomes at low pH, suggesting that a major role of NPC1 and the additional factor may be to move GP1 sufficiently out of the way so that GP2 can proceed along the fusion pathway [16].",

For one, the density of NPC1 (or its C-loop) at the surfaces of the target cells employed may not have been high enough, in conjunction with low pH at 37\u00b0C, to trigger fusion. Secondly, although we tested adding the LE/Lys-abundant lipid BMP, which is needed for full fusion by Dengue and Uukuniemi viruses [45,46], the plasma membrane lipid composition may not support EBOV GPcl-mediated fusion, which is designed to occur in LE/Lys; the plasma membrane and LE/Lys membrane have different lipid compositions [43,44]. Or, the plasma membrane may contain a lipid or protein factor that is inhibitory to EBOV GPcl-mediated fusion. Another possibility is that an additional LE/Lys membrane protein, for example TPC2, is required. TPC2 is a membrane protein that mediates Ca++ efflux out of LE/Lys [58]; cells lacking TPC2 are strongly impaired for EBOV infection [25]. Perhaps TPC2 is needed to maintain a precise local concentration of Ca++ not mimicked in our experiments. Ca++ could be needed to stabilize the structure of the fusion loop, or for the fusion loop to interact with the LE/Lys lipid bilayer [38\u201340]. And lastly, another membrane protein in LE/Lys or a specific soluble component present in the lumen of LE/Lys (ion, small molecule, protein) could be required for EBOV GPcl to mediate robust fusion. Indeed, multiple factors could be needed to maintain a precise ionic milieu in the endosomal lumen [59] needed to support EBOV fusion. In this context it is potentially interesting that lipid and ion transporter proteins emerged in a recent Crispr screen for host factors required for EBOV infection [60].",

Effector and target cells were cocultured for 3 h, subjected to a 5-min pulse at the indicated pH at 37\u00b0C, and returned to the 37\u00b0C incubator. After 1 h, luciferase activity was measured as described in the Methods section. (B) Cell-cell fusion: lipid mixing: Effector HEK293T/17 cells expressing No or the indicated GP were labeled with DiO. Target HEK293T/17 cells were transfected to express surface-directed NPC1-C-loop and labeled with DiI. Effector and target cells were then cocultured for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, subjected to a 5-min pulse at the indicated pH (at 37\u00b0C), and then returned to the 37\u00b0C incubator. After 2 h, the cells were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of double positive (DiI and DiO) cells eliciting FRET (fused and hemifused) was calculated from the total number of stained cells, as described in the Methods section (see S3 Fig for sample FACS plots). Results in A represent mean +/- SD of triplicate samples from one of two experiments with similar results. Results in B represent mean +/- SEM of data from three independent experiments, each performed with triplicate samples. Statistical analyses are based on two-way ANOVA tests: for A each sample was compared to the respective No GP sample and for B compared to the pH 7.2 value in each group. ****p < 0.0001; **p < 0.01.",

(FFPM was not monitored at pH 4.5 due to excessive cell loss.) After 24 h, cells were lysed and assessed for the ratio of Renilla luciferase (virus entry and replication) over firefly luciferase (total cells), as described in the Methods section. (B): VSV pseudoviruses bearing the indicated GP (equal input as for the FFPM experiment in A) were added to COS7 cells (+/- C-loop, as indicated) as described above and then either mock-treated or treated with 40 mM NH4Cl, as indicated.
