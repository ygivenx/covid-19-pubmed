It is also the third most common pet species anaesthetised in the United Kingdom [2]. Rabbits are high risk anaesthesia patients, with a mortality risk 14 times higher than in dogs [3]. Possible reasons for this are that rabbits are easily stressed prey animals, they are difficult to intubate endotracheally and react to mask induction with volatile anaesthetics by extended breath-holding [4-6]. Rabbits have a large abdominal cavity in relation to the thoracic cavity, with the results that the pressure from the intestinal mass may interfere with respiration in dorsal recumbency during anaesthesia. Furthermore, obesity is increasing in pet rabbits, which also adds to the problem. Respiratory infection with Pasteurella pneumotropica, which is common in pet rabbits, may cause a reduction of the hydrogen ion driven respiratory drive, adding to the anaesthetic risk [7]. Rabbits are also prone to develop substantial hypotension during anaesthesia [8].",

TIVA with fentanyl in combination with either diazepam [17] or propofol [18] has only been examined in combination with neuro-muscular blocking agents, which may prevent evaluation of analgesic properties. Ketamine-fentanyl TIVA has been used in combination with local anaesthesia in rabbits for cranial surgery [19], but the quality of anaesthesia was not reported.",

Opioids inhibit sympathetic activity [22] and provide haemodynamic stability both during and after surgery. Sufentanil, which has been shown to inhibit sympathetic activity better than fentanyl in dogs [23], was used successfully in combination with the benzodiazepine midazolam for major surgery in dogs that were cardiovascularly compromised, and was shown to provide good hemodynamic stability [24]. One benefit of using TIVA with sufentanil-midazolam is that its effects may be antagonized with commercially available antidotes.",

No laryngospasm, swelling of the larynx or bleeding was encountered. The difficulty of endotracheal intubation in rabbits has been described in numerous studies [25-27]. Rabbits have a narrow oral cavity which makes visual intubation difficult and successful blind intubation requires both practice and routine. Using a specially designed laryngoscope such as the Flecknell\u2122 small animal laryngoscope (Alstoe Ltd. Animal Health, UK) may be helpful.",

The level of hypercapnia produced was similar to that produced by 2 MAC isoflurane [33]. Opioids are known respiratory depressants, and midazolam has been shown to slightly add to this depression in rabbits [34]. Despite marked respiratory depression, we chose to ventilate the rabbits minimally in order to evaluate the extent of respiratory depression. It is likely that the respiratory depression had an effect on other variables, such as the HR. However, experience shows that during short term anaesthesia, some degree of hypercapnia (6\u20137 kPa) is well tolerated in healthy cats and dogs [35], and may even be beneficial since it stimulates respiration and increases blood flow to the brain [36]. The occurrence of apnoea during maintenance of anaesthesia necessitates the use of mechanical ventilation, which is the main disadvantage of the protocol since it requires successful endotracheal intubation as well as the knowledge and skills of using a ventilator.",

A possible explanation for the increase is the sympathomimetic stimulation caused by endotracheal intubation [38]. Alpha-2-agonists are able to block cardiovascular responses caused by intubation and surgery in humans [39] and opioids can block the sympathetic response to surgery in dogs [23,24]. If intubation caused the increased HR in the present study, the medetomidine and sufentanil doses used must have been insufficient to prevent the response. The simultaneous hypercapnia and hypotension that developed may also have contributed to the increase in HR. Isoflurane increases heart rate by 20% because of depression of the vagal tone rather than an increase in the sympathetic tone [40].",

Maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane in NZW rabbits will give rise to MAP in the range of 33\u201382 mmHg [8]. The pressure measured in the auricular artery has been shown to be approximately 8 mm Hg lower than in the carotid artery [38]. In the present study MAP in the sedated rabbits (~70 mmHg) was lower than reported in non-sedated unrestrained resting rabbits (~80 mmHg), [37] and similar to MAP in rabbits after IV administration of 10 \u03bcg/kg BW dexmedetomidine (~75 mmHg), [44]. Midazolam alone [45] or in combination with sufentanil [24], has been shown to decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure in dogs, however MAP did not fall below 65 mmHg [24]. In humans, sufentanil-midazolam also decreases MAP (~75 mm Hg), [46,47]. In contrast to the present study, the human and dog studies included major surgery, which may have affected MAP. Uncorrected hypotension may contribute to the high mortality levels in rabbit anaesthesia [8] and cardiovascular support, which is routine in other animal species during anaesthesia, may possibly decrease mortality rates.",
