Since then, the virus, known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u201d is threatening the life of people of at least 140 countries including China (Table 1). On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19). COVID-19 patients exhibit flu-like symptoms, such as persistent coughing, fever, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing, which are similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).",

Compared with its close related coronavirus family member SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which infected 8096 and 2494 people in year 2003 and year 2012, respectively, the outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious with its high virulence. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a lower fatality rate compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the virus has already killed at least 1.8 times more people than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV combined together (Table 1).",
