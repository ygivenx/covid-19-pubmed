            "text": "RNA viruses are extremely diverse and rapidly evolving. Their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) readily generate single-nucleotide variants whilst lacking proof-reading capabilities[1]. RdRps are also highly prone to RNA recombination[2]; either through template-switching[3] or through non-replicative end-joining[4]. RNA recombination has been demonstrated to be responsible for the emergence of new strains or species of viruses such as rhinoviruses[5] and dengue virus[6], and the formation of vaccine-derived poliovirus[7]. Non-homologous RNA recombination is also responsible for the generation of defective RNAs[8, 9]. These are versions of the parental viral genome that can arise naturally during the course of viral passaging but have been truncated and rearranged by RNA recombination. While not encoding for functional viruses themselves, they can be amplified and co-passaged with the help of the wild-type \u2018helper\u2019 virus that provides the necessary machinery for replication, encapsidation and transmission. A defective RNA that accumulates to such an extent as to compete with or otherwise attenuate the replication of the parental virus is known as a Defective-Interfering RNA (DI-RNA)[10].",

As a result, our appreciation of the diversity of DI-RNAs and the range of situations in which they could play a role was greatly limited. Increasingly, due to the use and sensitivity of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, DI-RNAs have been observed in a multitude of viral systems under laboratory conditions (e.g. SARS coronavirus[18], HIV[19]), in clinical settings (e.g. measles[20], dengue[21] and chronic hepatitis C[22]) and in metagenomic or \u2018wild\u2019 samples (e.g. West Nile virus[23], influenza virus[24]). Despite this burgeoning range of hosts for DI-RNAs, limitations in NGS technologies including high artifactual recombination rates, short reads and a limited range of bioinformatics tools tailored to viral RNA recombination discovery has hindered our ability to detect and characterize DI-RNAs in complex or clinical samples.",

            "text": "Flock House virus (FHV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus originally isolated from grass grubs in New Zealand[25] and is perhaps the best-studied Alphanodavirus from the Nodaviridae family. FHV infects Drosophila flies and cells in culture as well as medically important genera of insects including mosquitos, (Anopheles gambiae), the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood), and the Chagas vector (Rhodnius prolixus Stal)[26]. Infection of these organisms by FHV has been demonstrated to have similar characteristics in terms of viral titer, virus dissemination and mortality as has been shown for fruit fly infections. FHV provides an excellent model system to study +ssRNA virus evolution by virtue of having one of the smallest known eukaryotic virus genomes[27]. Moreover, the viral life-cycle and details of the molecular biology of virus particle assembly, cell entry and particle disassembly are highly-characterized. FHV contains two genomic RNAs. RNA1 (3107 nts) encodes the viral RdRp and RNA2 (1400 nts) encodes the viral capsid protein. RNA1 also expresses a small sub-genomic RNA, called RNA3, that encodes the B2 protein responsible for inhibition of the anti-viral RNAi machinery[28]. FHV has been demonstrated to form DI-RNAs in multiple independent studies spanning three decades both in cell-culture[8, 26, 29\u201332] and in Drosophila melanogaster[33]. Many of these studies characterized individual DI-RNA genomes through sub-cloning and Sanger sequencing. Intriguingly, many of these DI-RNAs are highly similar. This indicates that either the DI-RNAs have emerged due to a common mechanism of formation or the presence of a common selectivity filter, or both. Our recent NGS studies of RNA recombination in FHV revealed a diverse array of RNA recombination events, suggesting that the genomic landscape of DI-RNAs is highly dynamic and likely contributes significantly to the diversity of viral genomes that form the viral quasi-species[34]. Despite these findings, studies to-date present only a single snap-shot of the DI-RNA genome landscape and do not capture the pathways of their emergence and evolution nor characterize any intermediate DI-RNA species that might arise during these processes.",

ClickSeq provides a robust platform on which to study RNA recombination in RNA viruses. Artifactual recombination is a common contaminant in NGS library generation and can easily obscure rare or non-canonical recombinant species. ClickSeq does not require template fragmentation and replaces enzymatic ligation steps commonly required in NGS library generation with click-chemistry. ClickSeq works by introducing small amounts of azido-nucleotides (AzNTPs) into RT-PCR reactions to generate azido-terminated cDNA transcripts. These cDNA fragments are subsequently mixed with alkyne-labelled DNA adaptors. The addition of a copper catalyst results in the \u2018click-ligation\u2019 of the two chemically-functionalized DNA substrates to produce an unnatural triazole-linked single-stranded DNA molecule[36]. ClickSeq prevents template switching during RT-PCR as well as non-specific ligation of RNA fragments. We demonstrated that ClickSeq reduces artifactual recombination to fewer than 3 events per million mapped reads[35]. As a result, ClickSeq provides a superior method for the detection of DI-RNAs and RNA recombination events.",

ONT nanopore sequencing has been used to rapidly characterize virus genomes from metagenomic samples[39], in the midst of Ebola virus outbreaks[40], and in targeted studies aimed at characterizing sequence variations within influenza virus samples[41]. Highly parallel direct RNA sequencing using Nanopore technology was also recently reported[42]. Due to the higher error-rate[43] of the nanopore sequencing technology compared to other RNAseq platforms, the exact identity of recombination events within single-molecule genomes may be inaccurate. However, long-read nanopore reads provide the distinct advantage of being able to sequence full-length cDNA copies of RNA virus genomes and thus can resolve multiple recombination events within a single RNA virus genome.",

By combining short-read and long-read sequencing technologies, we determine both the exact identity of RNA recombination sites and their correlation within the viral quasispecies. We find little evidence for the accumulation of intermediate defective RNA species that contain either only one, or smaller, deletions during the course of passaging. Rather, fully formed \u2018mature\u2019 DI-RNAs that are characterized by two to three deletions between a limited number of positions in each of the FHV genomic RNAs appear after approximately 9 days of viral passaging and accumulate rapidly. The accumulation of DI-RNAs corresponds with a reduction in the specific infectivity of the viral samples in each passage. This implies that partially formed DI-RNA species are not competitive and cannot accumulate in the manner that mature DI-RNA species do, perhaps due to the epistatic interaction of multiple recombination events. Alternatively, the formation of mature DI-RNAs may occur in a single step involving multiple simultaneous genome rearrangements.",

After purifying the click-linked cDNA with a Zymo DNA clean column, 18 cycles of OneTaq (NEB) PCR amplification adds the remainder of the p7 adapter along with the desired TruSeq index sequence. PCR product was cleaned again with a Zymo DNA clean column to remove excess primers and then ran on a 1\u20132% precast agarose e-gel (Invitrogen, E-Gel Electrophoresis System). cDNA libraries between 400 to 700bp were excised corresponding to insert sizes of 250-550bp and cleaned using the Zymo Research Gel DNA Recovery Kit.

After induction, the HDV ribozyme regenerates the authentic 3\u2019 end of the positive sense viral RNA, which is thus successfully recognized by the FHV RdRp allowing the initiation of viral replication[54]. We choose to initiate replication with this method to ensure that the starting viral population would be homogeneous containing only the full-length RNAs derived from the plasmid cDNA. After transfection, the viral inoculum was allowed to amplify for 3 days (Passage number = P0), after which most cells exhibited cytopathic effect. Subsequently, the supernatant from infected cells was collected and a 1mL fraction (10% of the total volume) was used to infect 10mL of fresh S2 cells in triplicate (Replicates R1, R2, and R3). Again, after three days, 1mL of the supernatant was harvested and used to infect fresh S2 cells in series for a total of nine 3-day passages (Passage numbers = P1 \u2013P9). Therefore, one single inoculum was used to generate three distinct lineages as shown in Fig 1. For each passage and replicate, including the original inoculum, viral particles were purified over a sucrose cushion and non-encapsidated genetic material was degraded to ensure that the genetic material subsequently analyzed was packaged within the viral capsid. RNA was extracted from the purified viral particles using standard silica-based spin columns.",

We obtained 1.2\u201330.6 million reads after trimming and quality filtering for each passaged sample, and 41.6 million reads for the original inoculum (Table 1and S1 Table). 1 million reads corresponds to an average coverage of greater than 33\u2019000X across the FHV genome. Reads were aligned to the FHV genome and the host genome (D. melanogaster, fb5_22) using Bowtie end-to-end mapping [47]. As expected, the majority of the reads aligned to FHV RNA1 (3107 nts) and FHV RNA2 (1400 nts) in a ratio reflecting the longer length of RNA1. As we have observed previously [34, 55], 0.3\u20138.4% of reads correspond to host RNAs that are encapsidated within the viral particles including mRNAs, ribosomal RNAs and retrotransposons. Interestingly, the amount of encapsidated host RNA increases modestly through later passages (S1 Fig).",

When comparing the frequency of unique recombination events in either RNA1 or RNA2 between any pair of the three replicates, we find excellent correlation (Pearson >0.99) even for very infrequent recombination events, as illustrated in the scatter plots in S2 Fig. Events that were found in two replicates but not a third, never exceeded more than 20 mapped reads for RNA1 and 8 reads for RNA2. If we take these values as a cut-offs, below which we begin to fail to detect events, then we can conservatively estimate that we are reproducibly sensitive to recombinant species that are present at approximately 0.048% (20/42,000) of RNA1 population and 0.044% (8/18,000) of the total RNA2 population when obtaining ~1M sequence reads.",

However, due to the low-rate of artifactual recombination of the ClickSeq approach (>3 events per millions reads [35]), we can be confident that these are not sequencing artifacts[35].

Coverage in the wild-type RNA2 mapping in these regions ranges between 2.6M and 4.8M mapped reads, therefore these recombinant species make-up approximately 0.2% of the viral RNA2 population. The majority of other recombination events are found to delete a similar region of RNA2. This region is important as it has previously been reported to be deleted in FHV DI-RNAs. However, in the inoculum we do not observe deletions upstream in the RNA2 gene (for example 250^513), also reported to be deleted in previously characterized FHV DI-RNAs.

In subsequent passages there was a rapid increase in the total proportion of mapped recombination events (peaking at 11.9% in P8R1) (Table 1, Fig 2A). In these later passages for each replicate, it can be seen that the most common recombination events are deletions that span two regions in each genomic RNA including: nts 300\u2013940 and nts 1240\u20132300 of RNA1; and nts 250\u2013510 and nts 740\u20131220 of RNA2, consistent with previous observations of FHV DI-RNAs[31] (S1 Datafile).

Many of these are observed only in one passage and not in subsequent passages. Again, these events likely correspond to stochastically generated RNA recombination events that form non-viable defective RNAs. We reasoned that analyzing these events would more accurately reveal the nucleotide preference of the FHV RdRp for RNA recombination as they were not subject to replicative selection (although they must be packaged by FHV particles), unlike the DI-RNAs. Therefore we extracted all recombination events occurring with fewer than 10 mapped reads throughout all FHV passages and replicates (20\u2019723 unique events from a total of 11.6M possible permutations [8]) and counted the frequency of nucleotides found both up and down-stream of 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 recombination sites in the reference genome. As shown in Fig 2C, this revealed a preference for A\u2019s 1-3nts downstream of 5\u2019 sites, a preference for U\u2019s 1-3nts upstream of 5\u2019 sites, a weaker preference for a C 1nt up stream of 5\u2019 sites, and an aversion to G\u2019s 2nts both upstream and downstream of 5\u2019 sites.

This trend was maintained also when analyzing only recombination events without ambiguity in the site of recombination (i.e. sites that lacked \u2018fuzziness\u2019 as reported by the ViReMa pipeline[32]). This result is similar to what we have previously reported[8]. However, here we provide a much larger dataset and analyze events that we can determine are not amplified in subsequent passages, providing greater confidence that these sites reflect the preference for RNA recombination at these sites rather than the selection of replicatively viable defective RNA species.",

            "text": "Since many recombination events resulted in deletions of the viral genome, we were curious to see if the open reading frame (ORF) was conserved, as conservation of an ORF has frequently been observed to be a property of defective and defective-interfering RNAs[58]. Moreover, it has previously been shown that cloned DI-RNAs vectors containing eGPF in their putative ORFs do indeed express fluorescent protein[59] although it is not clear whether a functional ORF is essential for DI-RNA formation or propagation. In the earliest passages, only ~33% of deletions removed a multiple of 3 nucleotides (i.e. they thus conserved the ORF), as would be expected if deletion events occurred randomly throughout the genome. However, with continued passaging, there was a general trend toward conservation of the ORF for both RNA1 and RNA2 (Fig 2D), although this was not the case for all replicates. Specifically, while initially showing an increase in ORF conservation, replicate 2 of RNA2 showed a decrease in the conservation of the ORF after passage 4, in contrast to the other two replicates, and in fact dips below 33%. Closer inspection of individual recombination events shows that this trend is driven by three of the four most common recombination events in replicate 2 passages 4 to 9: 249^517, 736^1219, 250^513 and 249^519 (the latter three events in bold do not maintain the ORF). These events are observed in the other replicates, but at a much reduced frequency (no more than 1% of the total RNA2 recombination events for reps 1 and 3) (S1 Datafile). This indicates that DI-RNAs can indeed accumulate without a strict requirement for a functional ORF. However, this analysis only takes a single recombination event into consideration and the Illumina reads are not long enough (150bp) to resolve multiple deletions at the same time. Nevertheless, neither compensatory recombination events including small InDels that might restore the ORF, nor single nucleotide variants at putative stop-codons, were found.",

We plotted these data to generate recombination profiling maps for each RNA of FHV throughout passaging (Fig 3and S2 Fig). In the first passage, there is a relatively even distribution of nucleotide deletions along the whole length of the genome with the exception of two frequently excised regions in the 3\u2019 end in RNA1 due to two common recombination events in each of the replicates: 2545^2685 and 2277^2435. By passage 3 the deletions along the genomic landscape begin to be \u2018sculpted\u2019 whereby certain regions are deleted with a greater frequency than others. Passages 5, 7, and 9 were sculpted further revealing three major regions that were deleted in RNA1 and two in RNA2. Interestingly, for both RNA segments, while a range of deletions and rearrangements are generated during early passages, only the deletions that maintain regulatory and control elements are amplified during continued passaging, as previously observed in FHV [32]. These include the 5\u2019/3\u2019 UTRs and internal response elements (intRE) of both genomes, as well as the Proximal- and Distal-Subgenomic Control Elements (PSCE and DSCE) in RNA1 (Fig 3), which correlates to the findings that these regions are important and required for RNA replication and encapsidation [29, 30, 32, 60\u201364].",

However, in order to determine the correlation of these events over time, we used long-read ONT nanopore sequencing, which can characterize full-length wild-type and defective genomes (Fig 4and S4 Fig). We reverse transcribed and amplified both RNA genes using primers specific to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 UTRs of RNA1 and RNA2 from all passages of replicate 2 to obtain cDNA that could be barcoded and analyzed using protocols for 2D sequencing on the ONT MinION. The ClickSeq data shows that these regions were highly conserved during passaging (Fig 3), therefore we were confident using template-specific primers to these regions would capture both the full-length wild-type virus genomes as well as any defective RNAs. After PCR amplification, we analyzed the MinION cDNA libraries using agarose gel electrophoresis to observe the distribution of cDNA fragments and ratios of full-length to defective RNA genomes (Fig 5A). While the cDNAs from the early passages are predominantly of the expected size for full-length RNA genomes, later passages contain an array of band sizes. This shows that in the early passages the full-length genome is the predominant species while in later passages the truncated version becomes predominant. We also observe species appearing to be larger than RNA2. It is possible that some of these species correspond to RNA2 homodimers or other complex rearrangements that have previously been observed[65] and would result in an increased molecular weight. Evidence of RNA1 homodimers (3107^1), RNA2 homodimers (1400^1), and RNA2 to RNA3 heterodimers (1400^2720) can also be found in the ClickSeq data (S1 Datafile).",

We mapped between 94 and 97.5% of the MinION reads from each passage to the FHV reference genome (Table 3). An example of reads aligned to FHV RNA2 is shown in S4 Fig. The error rate of aligned reads, including single nucleotide mismatches and small InDels, was determined from alignment pileup files. Consistent with recent reports [66], we found the overall modal and mean error rates for all mapped position was 5.0% and 6.3% respectively, with 95% of the sites having an error rate better than 13.6% (N95 value = 0.864). A histogram of error rates for all mapped positions across all 9 datasets is shown in S5A Fig. Due to the large number of small InDels generated during nanopore sequencing [43], we also determined the frequency of deletions and insertions of different lengths (S5B and S5C Fig). This shows that small InDels are frequent, but fall quickly in abundance with increasing length. 99.8% and 99.9% of all MinION deletions and insertions respectively were shorter than 25nts.

In later passages (beginning at passage 3), we do begin to see the presumptive intermediates (e.g. 1_317^1091_3107 or 1_1242^2301_3107) of mature DI-RNAs (e.g. 1_317^1091_1242^2301_3107). However, this is after the mature DI-RNAs were first observed, and after the point at which DI-RNAs have begun to accumulate. Indeed, in passages 2 and 3 respectively, mature DI-RNAs make up 1% and 30% of the viral population while the singly-deleted intermediates make up 0% (unobserved) and 3%. Together with the observation of rare DI-RNAs in the inoculum with the ClickSeq recombination analysis, these data indicate that single-deletion species do occur early during passaging, but remain poorly abundant and do not accumulate. In contrast, mature DI-RNAs are observed to rapidly accumulate between passages, indicating that they possess a replicative advantage above both wild-type viral genomes and intermediate defective RNA species.",

In each case, these inserts corresponded to nts 2300\u20132513 of RNA1. This region corresponds to an internal response element (intRE) of the Proximal Sub-genomic RNA Control Element (PSCE) previously identified as being essential for FHV RNA replication and conserved in DI-RNAs species [60]. The most common deletion in the DI-RNAs in this region of RNA1 for the final passages are from 1242 to 2301, which retains the intRE. However, there are also a large number of deletions ranging from 1245 to 2514, which would delete the essential intRE. Closer inspection of the MinION data reveals that the majority of these reads (>90%) that contain the 200nt intRE insertion concomitantly contained deletions from 1245\u20132514, indicating that these two events are correlated.",

Repeating the ViReMa analysis using a seed length of 17 does indeed reveal the presence of the 20^2300 recombination event. This event is rarely observed in either of the other two replicate ClickSeq data (7 and 31 total reads across all passages of replicates 1 and 3 respectively). These data indicate that in a number of defective RNA genomes, the intRE element has been deleted and subsequently re-inserted at the 5\u2019 end of the defective RNA genome.

We found that illustrating these data as a stacked area plot gave the most informative summary of the changes of the many different type of DI-RNA species over time. Due to the moderate error-rate of the nanopore read data, the exact identification of a recombination event and thus annotation of that genome may be incorrect. This would result in an over-estimation in the potential number of unique structural variants. Therefore we filtered datasets by requiring genomes to be represented by three or more reads. While removing a lot of noise, this has the drawback that we might be losing rare defective RNAs. Stacked area plots for genomes represented by three or more reads are shown in Fig 6.

The TCID50 assay is used to determine the dose required to give a 50% chance that cells in culture will be successfully infected as determined by CPE and is typically used to determine viral titer and the effective MOI of the inocula transferred from passage to passage. The results from the TCID50 assay for each passage are shown in Fig 7A and 7B. We found that the TCID50 value (and thus PFUs(Plaque Forming Units)/ml) drops considerably during passaging by over four orders of magnitude.

Together, these data indicate virus specific infectivity drops with a corresponding increase in the defective RNA population.

Together these trends reflect a reduced specific infectivity during viral passaging, in agreement with our TCID50 assays.

While the short-read data provide high-resolution characterization of individual recombination events, it is through the use of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION that we are able reconstitute the complex full-length genomic landscape of FHV during passaging and determine the relative abundances of the genomic RNAs in each passage. As a result, we were able to determine that by the final passage only ~2% of the mapped reads are full-length viral RNA1, which corresponded with a large reduction in specific infectivity.

Nonetheless, the final recombination events are highly similar between replicates and to previous reports from different laboratories.

            "text": "While there is a strong selection pressure for DI-RNAs to retain essential functional genomic elements, it is also postulated that a shorter defective RNA would be replicated more quickly and thus more competitively [10]. In our analysis, while the ~250\u2013550 deletion in RNA2 (for example) is very common we do not observe the accumulation of deletion events that are smaller than this (e.g. 300\u2013450). This is despite the fact that we can detect and observe such species in low frequencies both in early and late passages, suggesting that they are indeed generated but are not selectively amplified. This may in part be due to selecting for DI-RNA genomes that are as small as possible, while retaining the minimal amount of genetic material to form functional genetic elements. However, it may also be the result of a negative selection pressure or restrictive barrier that is released only after excising specific portions of the viral genome. An example of this scenario has been demonstrated for tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) associated DI-RNAs whereby deletion of a translation enhancer functional element removes the competition between translation and replication, thus favoring replication of the smaller DI-RNA[68]. Therefore, the final structure of DI-RNAs may depend both on the retention of essential functional RNA elements, as well as the removal of restrictive barriers that attenuate RNA replication.",

The MinION data reveals that the defective RNAs that accumulate (rapidly over the course 2\u20133 passages) contain multiple deletion events. However, we do not see the rapid accumulation of the intermediate DI-RNAs, despite evidence for their presence early in viral passaging. This suggests that the mature DI-RNAs have a competitive advantage over their presumed intermediate precursors. If this is the case, the multiple deletions may function epistatically either through an undefined cooperative/additive mechanism or through the release of multiple restriction barriers, as proposed above. If multiple restriction barriers are required to be excised for the formation of DI-RNAs, small or multipartite RNA viruses, such as FHV or influenza[17], may therefore generate DI-RNAs more readily by requiring fewer intermediate steps than long, monopartite RNA viruses. Moreover, if intermediate defective RNAs fail to accumulate, this reduces the likelihood that mature DI-RNAs can subsequently be generated and may place substantial limitations on the ability of some viruses to generate DI-RNAs altogether.",

We are yet to determine the molecular mechanism of recombination that leads to DI-RNA formation. Both template-switching, secondary-structure jumping, and non-replicative mechanisms have been proposed, and indeed these mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive. Our observation of nucleotide preferences at recombination junctions (Fig 2C) may arise through any of these potential mechanisms. Alternatively, it is possible that multiple reassembly/deletion events occur in a single step, in a manner reminiscent of chromosome shattering (chromothripsis)[69]; or \u2018virothripsis\u2019. Within the confined invaginations of the mitochondrial membranes that form the replication factories of RNA viruses such as FHV[70], the fragmentation the RNA virus genome followed by incorrect re-stitching of these genome pieces, either through forced-copy choice template switching or a non-replicative mechanism, could create the DI-RNAs observed here including the complex rearrangements observed for RNA1.",

In our study we demonstrate that the viral swarm, even after only a few passages, is replete with many varieties of defective RNAs. With a single sequencing experiment, we would not be able to determine whether these defective RNAs are accumulating, diminishing or make-up a static component of the viral quasi-species. However, as we perform serial passaging with sequential sequencing experiments, we can determine which defective RNAs are accumulating (for example the \u2018mature\u2019 DI-RNAs) and which are not (e.g. the putative intermediate, or \u2018immature\u2019 defective RNAs). It would be impractical to validate each of the many hundreds of detected defective RNA species with molecular virological experiments to determine whether they truly can attenuate or interfere with wild-type virus replication and to therefore categorize that species as a defective-interfering RNA. Indeed, we cannot exclude the possibility that multiple DI-RNAs act co-operatively within the viral quasi-species and are mutually dependent upon one another. However, the demonstration here of an accumulation during serial passaging is strong evidence that these species are interfering, as their accumulation essentially dilutes the pool of wild-type functional virus. With this in mind, we believe it would be suitable to describe the mature defective RNAs as defective-interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs), and the \u2018immature\u2019 only as defective RNAs.",

By performing TCID50 assays of the original inocula used between each of the passages and of the particles purified from each passage, we show that there is a dramatic reduction in specific infectivity during passaging corresponding with the increase in the DI-RNA content. DI-RNAs have generally been demonstrated to arise at high MOIs, as was the scenario with our first passages. However, our calculated MOI drops rapidly after DI-RNAs have formed to levels that might be expected during typical in vivo viral passaging scenarios. However, in this experiment we were actually passaging a large number of virus particles between cells, but with a low specific infectivity. It is also interesting to observe that for the final passages there appears to be a protective property of the DI-RNAs as determined by flow-cytometry, but only when administered at the highest doses corresponding to over ~30,000 particles per cell. However, the role that DI-RNAs might play in vivo is not clear, as these very high doses may not be physiologically relevant. DI-RNAs for FHV similar to the ones described here have been observed to arise in experimental fruit fly infections [33] and so the mechanism of formation and/or selection is likely to be similar in cell culture and in vivo. However, whether RNA viruses such as FHV have evolved to favor the spontaneous formation of DI-RNAs and if so whether these DI-RNAs play an important role in modifying the life-cycle of the virus, is yet to be determined.",
