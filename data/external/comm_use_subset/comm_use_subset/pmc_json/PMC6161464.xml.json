In immunocompetent individuals, adenovirus infections often manifest as upper respiratory tract infections, pharyngoconjunctival fever, or diarrhoea. As in the case of other viral respiratory pathogens, community outbreaks of adenovirus infections may occur, especially with respiratory tract infections and keratoconjunctivitis. Such outbreaks may carry substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in terms of severe respiratory tract involvement [1, 2]. In immunocompromised hosts, adenovirus infections may present as respiratory tract infection, hepatitis, enteritis, haemorrhagic cystitis, disseminated infections, and graft loss in organ transplant recipients. High risk individuals include patients with primary immunodeficiencies (especially severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome), allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant and solid organ transplant recipients. Disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients may carry a case-fatality ratio of more than 50% [3].",

For example, adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis is often associated with species D, while enteric infections are often caused by F40 and F41 [3]. Respiratory tract infections, one of the commonest manifestations of HAdV infections, is frequently due to species B and C. There are considerable geographical variations in the prevalence of various species and serotypes causing respiratory tract infections. In recent studies from China, Malaysia, Croatia, and the USA, for example, species C is often the commonest serotype involved in community-acquired respiratory tract infections, followed by species B; while the serotypes C1, C2, and B3 were most frequently detected [4\u20138]. Similarly, species C is one of the commonest species involved in infections among the immunocompromised patients [3]. Understanding the epidemiology and prevalence of various HAdV species and serotype (ideally within one\u2019s locality) is important in order to choose the most appropriate diagnostic modality which demonstrates good sensitivity and specificity towards the clinically important strains.",

            "text": "Conventional viral culture has largely been supplanted by nucleic acid amplification tests in the diagnosis of adenovirus infections. The detection of adenoviral DNA by nucleic acid amplification offers excellent sensitivity and shorter turnaround time than viral culture, and is also a powerful tool in the discovery of novel viruses [9]. Nucleic acid amplification assays also allows easier determination of viral serotypes and quantification of viral load in clinical specimens. The determination of viral load is especially important for immunocompromised hosts who have a higher risk of developing severe and disseminated infections. It is now well established that high levels of HAdV DNAemia portends disseminated diseases and monitoring of viral load in peripheral blood and stool in susceptible hosts may have a role in early diagnosis and pre-emptive treatment of high risk individuals [10\u201314]. Viral load study is also useful in monitoring the response to antiviral therapy such as cidofovir [10]. A number of studies have been published on the development of HAdV quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocols [15]. We have previously developed a qPCR assay that can detect HAdV serotypes 11, 34, and 35 and shown that persistence of HAdV in the lower respiratory tract is common among immunocompromised hosts even without clinical adenoviral infections, and the viral load was correlated with low absolute lymphocyte counts [16]. In recent years a commercial qPCR assay kit was available for specific detection of HAdV which facilitates the diagnosis and monitoring of HAdV infections in clinical laboratories [17]. Adenovirus PCR is also included in a number of other commercial multiplex PCR systems for clinical diagnostics, and we have shown that some of the newer technologies such as the resequencing microarray could also be used for the diagnosis of gastroenteritis and conjunctivitis due to HAdV [18, 19].",

For example, one of the assays only included three serotypes (11, 34, and 35 of species B) [16]. In another study, the forward primer contained 1 base mismatch with species A, 2\u20133 mismatches with species B, 3 mismatches with species D, 2 mismatches with species E, 2 mismatches with species F, and 1 mismatch with species G; the reverse primer contained 1\u20133 mismatches with species A to F; and the probe contained 1\u20134 mismatches with species A to G [21]. One of the studies showed improved detection of HAdV species A to G by the use of several forward and reverse primers and probes that covered all species in a single reaction, but mismatches were still observed in the primers and probes [22]. In our study, only one primer/probe set was used using highly conserved primers and probe sequences. In our forward and reverse primer set, there was only 1 base mismatch at or near the 5\u2032 end of the primer with some types of species B and F only. For the probe developed in this study, there was 1 base mismatch with F41, but this did not affect the detection because our in-house assay was able to detect two F41 strains from our clinical samples. In silico analysis also suggested that our primer and probe set should be able to detect species G, although we did not have species G strains in our collection to confirm this. Our in-house qPCR assay was shown to be 100% specific for HAdV with no cross-reactivity against 32 human viral pathogens. This compares favourably to the RealStar\u00ae Adenovirus PCR Kit which is also 100% specific when tested against 35 different viral and bacterial agents [23]. Unlike the commercial kit which has been evaluated for the seven species (A to G) of HAdV, our in-house assay has only been tested for species A to F as we did not have species G samples in our archive. The diagnostic performance of the in-house assay was evaluated using 122 clinical specimens and 18 EQA samples. The HAdV species was further confirmed by partial sequencing of the hexon gene. Our in-house assay achieved a high sensitivity (98.1%) when compared to the commercial kit, and there correlation of the two assays is very good (R2 = 0.984). Our in-house assay has a linear range up to 9 log10 copies/mL, which is comparable to other studies [21, 24, 25]. There were very low intra- and inter-assay variations as reflected in the %CV values.",

The analytical sensitivity (LoD) was identified by evaluating a dilution series of HAdV-negative plasma and viral transport medium (VTM) matrices spiked with recombinant plasmids with the concentrations from 2.90 to 1.40 log10 copies/mL (plasma) and from 2.94 to 1.44 log10 copies/mL (VTM) and then subjected to TNA extraction as described above (Table 1). The LLoQ was determined by two independent runs of each concentration tested in replicates. The plasmid DNA concentration in ng/\u03bcL was measured by BioDrop \u03bcLITE (BioDrop, UK), and double-stranded DNA copy number calculator (http://cels.uri.edu/gsc/cndna.html) was used to convert ng/\u03bcL into copies/\u03bcL. Definite amount of plasmid DNA was spiked into 1 mL of matrix (plasma/VTM), followed by doing 2-fold serial dilutions to obtain different concentrations for testing. Analytical specificity (cross-reactivity) was determined by testing genomic DNA/RNA extracted from other viruses causing similar symptoms to adenovirus infections. The linear range of the in-house qPCR assay was evaluated by analyzing a dilution series of HAdV-negative plasma and VTM matrices spiked with plasmids with the concentrations from LLoQ to 109 copies/mL (in triplicates for each concentration). The intra-assay variation was evaluated by using HAdV-negative plasma and VTM matrices spiked with plasmids with 8 concentrations spanning the reportable range (LLoQ to 109 copies/mL; in triplicates for each concentration) in a single run, while the inter-assay variation was evaluated by the samples with 8 concentrations from LLoQ to 109 copies/mL (in triplicates for each concentration) in two independent experiments (Table 2). Coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean \u00d7 100) was calculated for each concentration.",

LLoQ was defined as the lowest dilution with a SD within 0.15 log10 copies/mL [29, 30]. The within-run and between-run precision of the in-house qPCR method for quantifying HAdV DNA was expressed by the coefficient of variation (CV). Agreement between the in-house qPCR assay and the RealStar\u00ae Adenovirus PCR Kit 1.0 was determined using a Bland-Altman plot of the samples positive by both in-house and commercial assays. Correlation of viral loads obtained from the in-house and commercial assays was performed by linear regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.",
