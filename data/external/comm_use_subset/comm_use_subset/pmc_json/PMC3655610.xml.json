This diverse set of effector functions generally contributes to clearance of infection but can also lead to immunopathology. Circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes derive their specificity from highly variable but clonally distributed T-cell receptors (TCRs) that inspect class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins. The composite surface of the surveyed molecule consists of an intracellularly derived antigenic peptide ligand that is presented by a protein heterodimer comprising the MHC heavy chain as well as an invariant beta-2 microglobulin (\u03b22m) light chain. For humans, the class I gene products of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) family of restriction elements are classical transplantation antigens encoded by three separate loci (i.e. HLA-A, -B, and -C) that are highly polymorphic. HLA variability and geographical distribution are significantly correlated, and allelic variants mark distinct ethnic groups. As a consequence, host ethnicity shapes the fine specificity of T-lymphocyte reactivity to several viral afflictions such as EBV 1, hepatitis B (HBV) 2, HCV 3, and HIV 4.",

            "text": "For the monitoring of T-cell-mediated immune responses, MHC multimer reagents 5 have been successfully exploited for the identification, enumeration, phenotypic characterization, and isolation of CD8+ T cells 6, 7. Several methodologies emerged to manage the variables affecting MHC antigen presentation, and enable multiparametric analysis of antigen-specific T-cell responses 8, 9. Combinatorial coding of MHC multimers, for example, has allowed parallel detection of multiple T-cell specificities using limited numbers of fluorochromes in high-throughput flow cytometry 10, 11. Another technological breakthrough came with the development of conditional ligands both for HLA complexes 12, 13 and murine MHCs 14\u201316, which facilitate the production of peptide-MHC reagents of diverse specificity from a common precursor through a peptide-exchange strategy. Originally, these reagents were designed for the archetypical HLA-A*02:01 12, and were later expanded to A*01:01, A*03:01, A*11:01, B*07:02 13, as well as B*57:03 17, thereby providing significant coverage for the Western European population. Over half of the world's population, however, inhabits regions within Asia and Oceania or has its origins there (World Population Data sheet 2011, http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx). Paradoxically, the accurate definition of T-cell epitopes for Asian HLA variants has long trailed its European counterparts. Therefore, we report the peptide-exchange technology for seven HLA-A, five HLA-B, and four HLA-C restriction elements commonly associated with Asian ancestry to enable comprehensive assessment of the corresponding CD8+ T-cell responses.",

The caged HLA complexes subsequently facilitate the rapid determination of peptide fine specificity and HLA restriction, thus alleviating an epitope discovery bottleneck while conserving PBMC samples in the process. Retrospective assessment of our screening demonstrates that the majority of these epitopes would not have been discovered if only select restriction elements or antigenic proteins had been considered, or bioinformatic selection of peptides applied; the restrictions that are commonly imposed 10, 18\u201320.",

Long-wave UV exposure triggers the photolysis of the Anp residue, resulting in the fragmentation of the ligand, while not affecting other amino acids of the complex. Several designs have been published 12, 13, 17 as variability in peptide-binding motif often prohibits interchangeable use between HLA products 21. We aimed to develop conditional ligands for the principal SEA variants consisting of HLA-A*02:03, -A*02:06, -A*02:07, -A*02:11, -A*11:01, -A*24:02, -A*33:03, -B*15:02, -B*40:01, -B*46:01, -B*55:02, -B*58:01, -C*03:04, -C*04:01, -C*07:02, and -C*08:01. These cover the majority of HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules having allele frequencies of more than 5% in Asia (Fig. 1) with negligible occurrence in Caucasians. In fact, A*11:01, A*24:02, B*40:01, C*03:04, and C*08:01 dominate in SEA populations with allele frequencies at least 10% higher than in Europe.",

The Anp introduction in central positions of the peptide endeavored effective liberation of the peptide-binding cleft after UV-induced fragmentation. After their synthesis, the identity of the conditional ligands was ascertained with LCMS analysis (Supporting Information Fig. 1B). Each peptide was subsequently refolded with its corresponding heavy and light chain, biotinylated, and purified by size-exclusion chromatography to produce HLA monomers 22. Although comparing yields is contentious, as the refolding concerns distinct molecular complexes, several trends were discernible. For example, the HLA-A products with an average yield of approximately 10 mg/L outperformed HLA-B that furnished only approximately 3.2 mg/L. Variation could be as high as 300-fold between HLA products, with A*24:02 providing the highest (\u223c45 mg/L) and A*33:03 (\u223c0.15 mg/L) the lowest yield, presumably reflecting differences both in ligand affinity as well as the overall stability of the complex. For analogs designed from the same parent peptide, 100-fold differences could be observed (\u223c13 mg/L to \u223c0.15 mg/mL for A*33:03). The highest yielding conditional ligand for each HLA was selected for the following experiments (Fig. 2).",

We evaluated the structural integrity of our HLA complexes by monitoring for the presence of the noncovalently associated \u03b22m subunit. The in vitro HLA-stability ELISA allowed us to verify the extent of HLA disintegration during various stages of the photocleavage reaction as indicator for effective peptide exchange 22. For the 16 pertinent HLAs, no appreciable degradation of conditional ligand-loaded complexes was observed in the absence of UV irradiation (Fig. 3). Exposure to UV light resulted in near-quantitative loss of signal for the majority of HLA products examined. However, A*11:01, A*24:02, C*07:02, and C*08:01 displayed exceptional stability with up to 39% of \u03b22m still present after cleavage (Fig. 3) that is reminiscent of the production yield of those complexes (Fig. 2). After UV fragmentation 12, the unfolding, aggregation, and precipitation of the complex could be prevented by inclusion of peptides capable of reoccupying the peptide-binding groove, thus conferring stability, and delivering novel specificity in the process. For antigens derived from EBV, human cytomegalovirus, HBV, DENV, and influenza A virus that conform to the reported restriction elements, restoration of each of the 16 complexes with at least two separate ligands proved feasible in individual exchange reactions (Fig. 3 and Supporting Information Table 2). However, peptides lacking the proper complementarity failed to rescue the HLA after UV irradiation, especially when mismatched in HLA supertype 21. For example, the EBV-derived LMP2426\u2013434 (CLGGLLTMV) restricted by A*02:01 (i.e. HLA-A2 supertype) proved unable to conserve the integrity of B*40:01. HLA micropolymorphisms also affect peptide binding, where both Env183\u2013191 (FLLTKILTI) and Pol455\u2013463 (GLSRYVARL) associate well with A*02:01 2, but only Env183\u2013191 proved capable of stabilizing the closely related variants A*02:03, A*02:06, and A*02:11 (Fig. 3). Collectively, this demonstrates successful temporary stabilization and peptide-exchange using conditional ligands tailored to Asian HLA variants.",

We screened for CD8+ T-cell responses in individuals with a history of acute HBV, exposure to DENV, or SARS-CoV. PBMCs were in vitro stimulated with peptide pools of 15-mers overlapping by ten amino acids, thus covering the entire viral proteome of DENV-2 (660 peptides), HBV genotype B (313 peptides), and the SARS-CoV NP (83 peptides), and 3a protein (53 peptides) 2, 25. IFN-\u03b3 secretion was first assessed by ELISPOT, and positive pools were deconvoluted by stimulating the PBMCs with individual peptides followed by measuring IFN-\u03b3 production by intracellular cytokine staining. We identified novel CD8+ T-cell responses against 15-mers derived from HBV polymerase (Pol33) and (Env72, Env34), DENV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3\u2013108), as summarized in Fig. 5A, together with antigens embedded in the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid and 3a proteins (NP44, NP65, 3a2) 25. Based on the HLA genotyping of the short-term T-cell lines (Supporting Information Table 3) and the HLA-binding motifs 21, we anticipated the restriction elements of the HBV Pol33 and Env72 lines to be B*58:01, and the DENV NS3\u2013108 line to be B*55:02. The SARS-CoV NP65 and 3a2 peptides were known to be presented by B*40:01 and B*58:01, respectively. To move away from inferring HLA restriction from panels of peptide-pulsed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs), which is consumptive on samples, we derived 18 distinct overlapping 9-, 10-, and 11-mer peptides from each 15-mer epitope (Supporting Information Fig. 3A). The HLA-stability ELISA allowed us to rapidly screen the ability of each peptide to rescue various HLA complexes from denaturation 22. The SARS NP44 15-mer 25, for example, had three embedded peptides restricted by either A*02:01 or B*40:01 (Fig. 5B\u2013E). For the SARS-CoV, DENV, and HBV 15-mer antigens, we found at least one peptide in each 18-member set that stabilized an HLA product from our library. These 9- and 10-mers mostly bound to the anticipated HLAs (Supporting Information Fig. 3B\u2013I), and were often positioned at the N- or C-terminus of the parent peptide (Fig. 5A), underscoring the importance of the overlapping peptide screening approach.",

Employing a SARS NP44 T-cell line 25, we found that both 9- and 10-mer peptides (i.e. GETALALLL and GETALALLLL) stabilize B*40:01 (Fig. 5D), yet the cell line stained positive only with B*40:01 tetramers loaded with the 10-mer (Fig. 6). We frequently observed that the extension or contraction by a single amino was not detrimental to HLA binding of a peptide, yet only optimal epitopes were recognized by their corresponding TCRs. Short-term expanded SARS-CoV NP65, DENV NS3\u2013108, and HBV Pol33 and Env72-specific lines stained with their corresponding B*40:01, B*55:02, or B*58:01 tetramers (Fig. 6B) but not PBMCs from unrelated controls (Fig. 6A). For the SARS 3a2 and HBV Env34 lines, the peptides preselected by ELISA failed to yield functional staining reagents. Comprehensive tetramer screens with all 18 truncated peptides; however, revealed SITAQPVKI and FLGPLLVLQA to be the optimal antigens presented by B*58:01 and C*08:01, respectively. For the seven characterized epitopes (Table 1), T cells bound their HLA counterpart with moderate affinity, as judged by the MFI shift for the individual tetramers. Only the B*58:01-presented HBV Pol33 9-mer and HBV Env34 10-mer being displayed by C*08:01 provided staining such that antigen-specific cells were clearly resolved from the main CD8+ T-cell population. The functionality of all lines, established by IFN-\u03b3 production and CD107 surface expression upon peptide stimulation, confirmed the HLA-tetramer results (Fig. 6C).",

            "text": "We deliberately chose not to employ bioinformatic predictions to select our candidate antigens even though their adoption is commonplace 8, 18, 19, 26, 27, but we were curious to assess whether state-of-the-art algorithms could reproduce the outcome of our discovery efforts. We selected NetMHCpan, which (i) has the ability to compute the binding capability of peptides even for HLA products for which experimental data is scarce, (ii) can accommodate epitopes of variable length, and (iii) is publicly accessible 28\u201330. We performed IC50 predictions for all possible 8, 9, 10, and 11-mer epitopes (encompassing 2716 SARS-CoV, 6256 HBV, and 12690 DENV peptides) of each HLA variant of the donor's genotype. For data inclusion, we imposed a 1000 nM affinity threshold, which is less stringent than the conventional IC50 cutoff of 500 nM, while providing an estimated specificity of 0.95 and sensitivity of 0.74 29. Peptides were ranked by IC50 value, and for each experimentally derived epitope the rank was determined within the complete HLA constellation of the PBMC donor as well as for the correct restriction element (Table 2). Even this liberal strategy would instantly preclude the discovery of two novel epitopes. Peptides SITAQPVKI and FLGPLLVLQA were predicted not to bind HLA-B*58:01 and HLA-C*08:01, respectively, with IC50 values 10\u201320 fold above the cutoff. Moreover, predictions can be misguiding, as FLGPLLVLQA was predicted to have affinity for HLA-A*02:01 (20.44 nM), while for its true restriction element HLA-C*08:01 the IC50 of 22942.68 nM would have excluded it from consideration. Given that predictive methods aim to reduce the magnitude of the peptide collection under investigation, a full proteome-based bioinformatics screen should encompass no more peptides than an overlapping peptide library. In this scenario, the total number of peptides to screen with NetMHCpan would at most be equal to the collection of our ELISPOT screens (i.e. 313 peptides for HBV, 136 peptides for SARS-CoV, and 660 peptides for DENV). The conditional tetramer reagents developed here comprise 17 different HLA molecules, including the reported HLA-A*02:01 12, and therefore the number of highest ranking peptides to screen per HLA will be 18 for HBV, eight for SARS-CoV, and 38 for DENV. Following these criteria, three of the seven novel epitopes would not have been discovered based on HLA-specific rankings (i.e. SITAQPVKI, SVIWMMWYW, FLGPLLVLQA, Table 2). If the NetMHCpan algorithm would have been employed to curtail the peptide collection to half the size of an ELISPOT screen, the peptides to screen per HLA would be nine for HBV, four for SARS-CoV, and 19 for DENV, and the majority of novel antigens (i.e. MEVTPSGTWL, SITAQPVKI, SVIWMMWYW, FLGPLLVLQA) would have been missed. Although other methods might well outperform on individual allele-specific predictions, we submit that employing NetMHCpan is the most appropriate strategy for PBMC donor cohorts with high HLA polymorphism 28\u201330, particularly in populations with a preponderance of class I HLA variants for which limited experimentally verified data is available. This exposes current limitations with the deployment of predictive algorithms and validates our approach of using overlapping peptide libraries together with high-throughput tetramer screening to identify and characterize novel T-cell epitopes.",

Conditional ligands integrate the use of MHC-based multimer arrays with high-throughput flow cytometric analysis of antigen-specific T cells, as they allow the rapid synthesis of MHC molecules of distinct specificity through a peptide-exchange protocol. This strategy can be applied for screening of class I MHC-associated antigens. We sought to extend this technology specifically for Asian populations, and therefore designed and synthesized 30 UV-light sensitive conditional ligands, and constructed the corresponding HLA molecules. Thus, we expanded the portfolio of conditional ligand-loaded HLAs nearly threefold and for the first time included HLA-C allelic variants. Despite the polymorphic nature of HLA, this library includes the majority of alleles in Asia (Fig. 1), the world's most populous region. The stability of the complexes was validated, and all HLA variants proved cooperative with ligand replacement (Fig. 2). The corresponding tetramers could also detect common virus-specific CD8+ T-lymphocyte responses in healthy volunteers (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "For the identification of novel epitopes for Asian HLA variants, we combined ELISPOT and conditional ligand-based assays (i.e. the HLA-stability ELISA and HLA tetramer arrays), thereby building on the key features each technology affords while circumventing their limitations. The ELISPOT assay, which quantifies the active secretion of cytokines, is recognized for its high sensitivity compared with assays such as bead-based assays or intracellular cytokine staining 31, 32. It also permits screening with pooled overlapping peptides, usage of clinical samples is economical, and lymphocytes maintain their viability, making it amenable for high-throughput proteome-wide antigen screening 31, 32. In ongoing epitope identification efforts for HBV, SARS-CoV, and DENV infection, we identified seven 15-mer peptides capable of stimulating T-cell responses in Singaporean donors (Fig. 5 and 6). The HLA restriction and fine specificity of the epitopes would commonly be inferred from cellular assays. These, however, suffer from simultaneous expression of various HLA variants that complicates data interpretation. We used caged Asian HLAs to measure their receptiveness to accommodate shorter peptides embedded in the parent 15-mer antigen. This rapidly pinpointed the likely antigenic sequences, while utilizing low amounts of HLA reagents and sparing precious PBMC samples. Ultimate confirmation of the peptide fine specificity and HLA restriction element responsible for engendering the T-cell response was provided by staining with arrays of HLA tetramers, which allowed rapid visualization and quantification of in vitro cultured, cryopreserved samples or freshly isolated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells with high specificity and sensitivity. HLA tetramers thus not only permit the monitoring and isolation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes 5\u20137, but their usage extends to screening for novel CD8+ T-cell antigens 10, 12\u201316. In seven of seven times, the antigenic epitope was correctly identified, validating our approach to reduce the number of epitopes by biophysical means. The construction of the 16-membered peptide-exchangeable HLA library gives sufficient coverage for epitope screening in Asia where the probability of matching the HLA profile of a lymphocyte donor with at least one caged HLA is high for SEA (HLA-A: 93%, -B: 63%, -C: 79%) as well as the closely related populations from Oceania (HLA-A: 88%, -B: 46%, -C: 82%). This contrasts with the European (HLA-A: 30%, -B: 11%, -C: 54%) and North American regions (HLA-A: 74%, -B: 5%, -C: 74%) for which equivalent molecules have already been designed 12, 13. Similar efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa (HLA-A: 11%, -B: 23%, -C: 42%) or Southwest Asia (HLA-A: 53%, -B: 10%, -C: 38%), where HLA diversity is more pronounced, would need a suite of reagents that is proportionally extended. Finally, we found through retrospective analysis that bioinformatic strategies for the prediction of HLA-restricted epitopes would likely have failed to identify a considerable portion of the novel CD8 T-cell epitopes described herein.",

Higher dimensional staining for distinct antigen-specific T-cell subsets has become feasible by labeling HLA multimers with unique combinatorial codes 10, 11, or passing the cells through microarray platforms for on-surface inspection 8. An emerging technology that labels cell surface markers with heavy metal ions for CyTOF analysis that, among its advantages, eliminates the need for fluorescence compensation, enables simultaneous immunophenotypic tracking of large cellular subsets 6, 33, 34. For various pathologies where T-cell immunity strongly correlates with protection, the exploration of their therapeutic value is both warranted and increasingly met with clinical success 35\u201337. Redirected T cells that target virally infected or malignant cells may be generated either by in vitro expansion of autologous lymphocytes 35, 38, or by genetic modification to drive TCR expression of the desired specificity, before being infused into patients. All such developments rely on accurate definition of antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses, and the HLA libraries for Asian variants reported here are essential for the characterization and enumeration of clinically relevant antigen-specific CD8+ T cells 8.",

(A) Seven 15-mer peptides capable of stimulating T-cells reactive toward SARS-CoV, HBV, or DENV antigens were discovered by ELISPOT screening. All 18 possible 9-, 10-, and 11-mer truncated peptides imbedded in the 15-mer epitope that either tested positive in the HLA-stability assay (gray bars) or gave HLA tetramer staining (black bars) are indicated below the sequence. Numbering of the peptide fragments is provided in Supporting Information Fig. 3A. (B) Soluble HLA-A*02:01 molecules were ligand exchanged with truncated peptides from SARS NP44 15-mer peptide. The resulting complexes were captured on streptavidin-coated plates and probed for \u03b22m as a marker for HLA complex stability. As controls, the photocleavable HLA molecules were treated with (+) or without (\u2013) UV irradiation in the absence of rescue peptide (black bars). Peptides are labeled as capable (red bars) or incapable (white bars) of stabilizing the corresponding HLA. (C) Stabilization of soluble HLA-A*02:07 by truncations of the SARS NP44 15-mer peptide was assessed as in (B). (D) Stabilization of soluble HLA-B*40:01 by truncations of the SARS NP44 15-mer peptide was assessed as in (B). (E) Stabilization of soluble HLA-B*46:01 by truncations of the SARS NP44 15-mer peptide was assessed as in (B). (B\u2013E) Data are shown as mean + SEM of four replicates.",
