Viral phylogenies are commonly inferred from aligned molecular sequence data, using the information available in substitutions shared by descent [3-6]. Short time-scales dominate in the development of rapidly emerging disease strains, such that the number of observed substitutions between sequences can be too low to yield well-resolved phylogenies. Thus, to increase phylogenetic resolution for such disease strains we seek to make use of a wider class of phylogenetic information.",

            "text": "Insertions and deletions (indels) are a promising category of molecular sequence information that is largely ignored in phylogenetic reconstruction. Researchers commonly remove gaps from molecular sequences alignments by coding them as missing data or by throwing out columns that contain gaps [3-6]. Indels may be useful to resolve deep branches in the Tree of Life that are difficult to resolve using information in shared substitutions [7,8]. At the other extreme, on which we focus here, indels can help to resolve phylogenies in situations where the number of nucleotide substitutions is inadequate. For example, indels in non-coding chloroplast DNA have been helpful in resolving the branching order of recent plant radiations [9,10]. The rate of indel events in these regions approaches or surpasses the rate of substitution, making indels too important to ignore [10]. Several species of viruses are also known to accumulate indels, sometimes at a high rate. Cheyner et al. [11] note that indel rates are higher than substitution rates in hyper-variable regions of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Other viruses also experience indels on short time-scales. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) accumulates deletions in the core/pre-core region during the course of infection [12], while Equine Infectious Anemia Virus accumulates insertions [13]. Three deletion variants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) appeared during the beginning of the SARS outbreak in China [14]. Influenza B viruses accumulate indels over several decades [15]. We note that these viruses are all RNA viruses, with the exception of HBV. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it reverse transcribes its DNA genome from an RNA intermediate.",

This method uses a joint reconstruction framework that simultaneously infers the alignment, tree, and insertion/deletion rates. Estimation proceeds through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) within a Bayesian framework and naturally accounts for uncertainty in alignments, phylogenies, and other parameters through posterior probabilities. Unlike sensitivity analysis [16,17], this approach takes into account uncertainty resulting from the myriad of near-optimal alignments. This approach involves averaging over unobserved quantities such as the alignment and interal node states, which can lead to improved estimates [18]. This is different from other approaches which iteratively optimize a heuristically chosen cost function until no improvement is seen [19,20]. Joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps bias that results from conditioning on a single alignment estimate [21,18], bias which may be exaggerated when indel information is inappropriately used.",

Heuristic \"costs\" for opening and extending gaps are replaced by the insertion/deletion rate and the mean indel length respectively, which are biologically interpretable parameters and can be estimated from the data without circularity [22,23]. Gaps are not treated as a fifth character state, since this overweights the evidence of shared indels by treating an indel of multiple residues as multiple shared indels [3]. Instead, the indel process is separate and independent of the substitution process, and allows indels of several residues simultaneously. In addition, because alignments represent positional homology, the indel process does not allow a newly inserted character to be aligned to a previously deleted character.",

To accomplish these goals, we introduce an improved statistical model of the insertion-deletion process to improve the accuracy of the inference, and describe a novel MCMC transition kernel to improve the speed of the inference. Once our statistical framework is in place, we then demonstrate that indel information can help to detect previously undetected bi-partitions in two real data examples from RNA viruses. While analyzing these data, we note that alignment ambiguity may significantly affect phylogeny inference. We note that codon-based alignments can unrealistically shift indels to avoid breaking codons, and we develop the necessary statistical machinery to demonstrate that this can substantially affect phylogeny estimates.",

In contrast to nucleotide-based CTMC models, codon-based models group the three nucleotides in a codon into a single letter. Given the small number of substitutions that occur during the emergence of rapidly evolving pathogens, codon-based models are preferred over amino-acid based models because they do not discard synonymous substitutions. Codon-based models can also improve model efficiency over nucleotide-based models because the codon-based models can include non-independent nucleotide frequencies and rule out missense mutations [25]. Codon-based models may also improve the accuracy of estimation by allowing the third-codon position to evolve at a higher rate. However, when the number of observed substitutions is low it may not be possible to estimate the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio \u03c9, requiring researchers to fix \u03c9 to a previously estimated value.",

We define the collapsed point (*, \u03c4, T, \u0398, \u039b)C as the set of points {(A, \u03c4, T, \u0398, \u039b) : A \u2208 C} for some set C. The posterior probability of a collapsed point is then naturally defined as the posterior probability of the set. When proposing a new tree (\u03c4', T') via SPR from the current point (A, \u03c4, T, \u0398, \u039b), we first use a Metropolis-Hasting (MH) transition kernel to choose between the collapsed points (*, \u03c4, T, \u0398, \u039b)C and (*, \u03c4', T', \u0398, \u039b)C. This avoids the problem of A being inconsistent with \u03c4' as long as C is large enough to contain alignments consistent with both \u03c4 and \u03c4'. Then we sample a single point from the chosen collapsed point in proportion to its posterior probability. To satisfy detailed balance, the set C must be constructed so that it contains at least the current alignment A; full conditions under which this procedure satisfies detailed balance are described in the Appendix.",

            "text": "We now seek a set C that is large enough to contain alignments consistent with \u03c4' and yet small enough for integration and sampling to be computationally feasible. Unfortunately, integration over the set of all alignments is not practical, even if we constrain the alignment of leaf sequences to be constant. Therefore, we fix parts of the alignment and collapse only the remaining portions. Allowing only the three branch alignments adjacent to node O (Figure 2) to vary will certainly allow an alignment consistent with \u03c4'. This is therefore a loose constraint, which we call C3(A, \u03c4, O). It requires an O(L3) dynamic programming algorithm for integration and resampling. To decrease the order of the dynamic programming algorithm to O(L1), we consider imposing the additional constraint, which we call C1(A, \u03c4, O), that the alignments between the three nodes connected to O remain fixed. However, this constraint is too tight because it forces all sequences in the subtree (Figure 2, hatched) to keep the same alignment with the remaining sequences, and may not include any alignments consistent with \u03c4'. As an alternative, we propose to fix the alignment between sequences in the pruned subtree and the alignment between sequences in the remainder, but allow the alignment between the two groups of sequences to vary. This constraint, which we call C2(A, \u03c4, OP) results in an O(L2) algorithm that is significantly more computationally efficient than an O(L3) algorithm. Note that we have demonstrated above that the alignment within the two subgroups of sequences remains consistent under an SPR proposal. Thus, the constraint set C2(A, \u03c4, OP) contains an alignment that is consistent with \u03c4' as well as \u03c4, making C2(A, \u03c4, OP) a useful constraint set for collapsed sampling.",

Triplet substitution models can prohibit stop codons, can make use of codon frequencies instead of nucleotide frequencies and can differentiate between synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Triplet alphabets affect the alignment model as well as the substitution model by forcing indels lengths to be multiples of 3 singlet letters and by forcing indels to start and end between triplets.

Furthermore, the increased support when the Clustal W alignment is used includes a branch that conflicts with the joint MAP model, and the conflicting branch is present in the guide tree. Thus ignoring alignment ambiguity can lead to exaggerated support for branches and bias towards the guide tree, especially when indel information is used. Figure 4 displays a \"gold\" plot [24] to summarize the posterior alignment distribution of A under the full joint model. We observe a high level of alignment uncertainty. This is borne out by the observation of only 4 unique indels under the full joint model, while the Clustal W alignment contains 5 indels. This difference is reflected in the lower estimate of \u03bb under the full joint model and in the restricted models not using the Clustal W alignment (Table 1).",

To examine the substantial decrease of 24.1 log units between models, we calculate the posterior distribution of parsimony tree lengths under both models. The posterior median tree length is 104 substitutions with a 95% BCI of (103,106) for the singlet model and increases to 109 substitutions with a 95% BCI of (108,110) for the triplet model.

The posterior mean number of indels is 11.0 and the BCI is (11,11). The posterior mean number of indels beginning 0, 1, or 2 nucleotides from the beginning of a codon is 2.6, 5.8, and 2.6 respectively. The 95% BCI for the number of indels beginning inside a codon is (6,10). Inspecting the alignment estimate from the MAP point using a \"gold\" plot demonstrates alignment uncertainty (data not shown). In the MAP alignment we observe 11 indel events. Only 5 of the indels are consistently present with unambiguous phase, and none of these indels can be placed between codons. Interestingly, one indel of 3 nucleotides occurs independently in clades (16,17), 19, and 22 according to the MAP estimate (Figure 5).

We note that under the HKY \u00d7 3 model \u03bb is the indel rate per triplet, whereas under the singlet model \u03bb is the indel rate per nucleotide. This factor of 3 difference is to be expected since the number of indels does not change between the two models, but the number of triplets is 3 times smaller than the number of nucleotides. The HKY \u00d7 3 model also results in a posterior median estimate of -2.6 for ln \u03b5 that is significantly smaller than the HKY estimate of -1.0. However, accounting for the fact that one triplet contains three nucleotides, the HKY \u00d7 3 model predicts a mean indel length of 1.1 triplets and 3.2 nucleotides, but the HKY model predicts a mean indel length of 1.6 nucleotides. This may be because a geometric distribution on the number of nucleotides in a gap does not fit the data as well as a geometric distribution on the number of triplets in a gap. This is especially true in data sets such as the present one in which the number of triplets tends to be small. It may also be because the indel model used is fragment-based.

The traditional model supports the clade (19,21,24,25) at a PP of 0.980 compared to 0.887 with indel information. The traditional model also supports the clade (10,12,15,16,18,19,21,24,25) at PP > 0.9 that has support < 0.5 when indel information is included. This results because the large clade conflicts with the clade (16,17) that is supported by two shared indels. Thus, the number of branches supported in only one of the two models at each level of PP is 4, 3, and 2. Since the joint model balances substitution and indel information as well as taking alignment ambiguity into account we assume that these differences represent an improvement in the accuracy of estimation. However, because the true tree is not observed, we cannot be certain which, if any, of the predictions is correct. The partitions supported under the two models at PP > 0.99 are depicted in Figure 6. In summary, indel information conflicts with one branch in the substitution-only tree and down-weights the evidence for another branch. The conflicting branch is ruled out by the support of 2 shared indels for the clade (16,17), although one of these is homoplastic.",

Golenberg et al. analyze non-coding spacer regions between chloroplast genes in a parsimony framework and claim that indels shared by state recur more often than substitutions shared by state [32], leading to a concern that indels are not reliable characters for phylogenetic analysis. However, Simmons and Ochoterana find indels to be reliable markers with low levels of homoplasy [33]. This contrast is partially explained by noting that the original Golenberg study incorrectly codes overlapping gaps of different lengths as homologous, leading to false homoplasy. Improved methods of coding indels when gaps overlap can lead to more accurate and more informative indel characters [33,34]. In addition, researchers note that chloroplast intergenic spacers contain indel \"hotspots\" and that sequence duplications or changes in the number of tandem repeats occur at a significantly higher rate than non-repeat indels [32,10]. This high rate can lead to identical but non-homologous insertions in different taxa, and so repeat indels experience higher homoplasy than non-repeat indels [9]. Repeat indels should therefore be down-weighted, but unfortunately an appropriate weighting scheme has not yet been developed [35]. We also note that current alignment algorithms do not recognize duplications or indel hotspots, so that automatic alignments must be adjusted manually. Despite these difficulties with repeat indels, researchers have examined intergenic spacers in various plant species using improved indel coding and find that indel information is consistent with substitution information and largely reinforces it, improving phylogenetic resolution and support [9,10]. In some analyses, indels are useful only in distinguishing larger groups [36]. Despite the utility of indels in phylogeny estimation, most researchers note difficulties in indel coding that result from alignment ambiguity [35]. This can be true even when the number of substitutions is too small to yield well-resolved phylogenies. While alignment ambiguity causes general problems with gap placement, some specific problems are worthy of mention. For example, aligning insertions of questionable homology may create spurious evidence for common ancestry [35]. Also, when the number of tandem sequence repeats decreases, it is unclear which repeat has been deleted. Resolving these ambiguities to yield a single alignment can increase the support for some trees while decreasing the support for others, leading to bias, and so regions whose homology is uncertain should be thrown out [35]. The joint estimation approach we advocate sidesteps many of the issues through the assignment of uncertainty on alignments, indel existence and placement.",

First, the model assumes that the indel rate is spatially homogeneous. However, biological sequences contain indel \"hotspots\" where indels are more likely to occur as well as invariant regions where indels are prohibited. Incorrectly accounting for rates at which indels occur in different regions can lead to over-weighting of the indel evidence. Clustal W attempts to place indels in hydrophilic regions of amino acid sequences, but does not have a mechanism for locating hotspots in non-coding sequences or hotspots resulting from weak selection or positive selection. Second, the indel model makes the common assumption that residues in a single sequence are never homologous. Duplications violate this assumption and are treated as insertions of random sequence by the indel process. Third, changes in the number of tandem repeats of a short sequence often occur at a higher rate than other indels via slipped-strand mispairing (SSM). However, no commonly used alignment program accounts for within-sequence homology or SSM. An improved stochastic process model that accounts for these properties of biological sequences is highly desirable in order to accurately weight shared indel evidence and to produce both more accurate alignments and phylogenies.",

Because the effects of the latter can be significant when the total number of substitutions is small, we welcome the development of an improved substitution model that does not force this tradeoff.

This means that it is often impractical to analyze data sets with greater than 12 taxa or sequence lengths longer than about 750 letters (nucleotide, amino acid, or codon). Analyzing data sets of this size often takes about a week on current hardware. However, we wish to emphasize two points. First, the long computation time is not required to make a simple estimate, but to obtain measures of confidence that are accurate enough to publish. For simple estimates or unpublished results, significantly larger data sets can be analyzed. Second, the amount of time required to analyze a data set depends not just on the size of the data set, but on various characteristics such as the level of uncertainty. For example, the second example in this paper contains 27 taxa of maximum length 612 and took about 3 weeks to analyze.",

Because the convergence times are so different, the figure depicts every 10th tree for the first 2000 iterations, whereas for the NNI+SPR chain the figure depicts every 2nd tree for the first 400 iterations. Points represent trees projected onto the plane using multidimensional scaling based on the Robinson-Foulds distance. This distance depends only on the topology, not the branch lengths.",
