There have been reports of success in several clinical trials of OIT for milk [8, 9], egg [10, 11], and peanut [12, 13] (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifiers in these clinical trials described in S2 Table). However, to date, the available evidence for the effectiveness, risk-benefit ratio and potential long-term consequences of OIT is insufficient to support its use in clinical practice. In addition, the optimal dose and length of therapy is also unclear. Previous studies on OIT have used a variety of doses, and the strategies were heterogeneous, making comparisons among them difficult [5, 14\u201316]. Moreover, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of OIT remain unclear [5]. To understand the precise mechanisms of OIT and determine whether OIT is effective and safe treatment against FA, an appropriate animal model needs to be established. Until now, however, appropriate animal models for OIT for egg allergies have not been available.",

            "text": "Kakkonto, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, is commonly used in Japan. The most important aspect contributing to the frequent use of kakkonto is that kakkonto is a highly effective and safe medicine for the treatment of the common cold [17, 18], influenza [19], allergic rhinitis [20] and diarrhea either as the sole source of therapy or in combination with modern Western medicines. We have previously demonstrated that kakkonto suppresses the occurrence of allergic symptoms in a murine FA model [21] and kakkonto induces Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the colon as a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic action [22]. It is reported that allergen-specific immunotherapy increases the production of local and systemic Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs as an essential step in patients [23, 24] and experimental models [25\u201328]. Therefore, we hypothesized that kakkonto might have a potential as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of immune diseases induced by the disruption of intestinal mucosal tolerance, such as FAs. In this study, we demonstrated that concomitant use of kakkonto with OIT (OIT+kakkonto) can result in better therapeutic efficacy for OIT using an OIT mouse model established in this study.",

Spray-drying was used to produce a dried extract powder. The chemical pattern of the extract obtained by three-dimensional HPLC analysis was shown in S1 Fig. The main bioactive compound in kakkonto is puerarin, which is an isoflavonoid derived from Puerariae Radix and possess many pharmacological effects such as antiinflammation, vasodilation, neuroprotection, antioxidant and anticancer [29].",

Kakkonto (500 mg/kg) was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose solution and administrated 1 h before each oral heated OVA challenge for a combination therapy. The mice were challenged with 20 mg OVA (non-heated) for evaluation of the clinical symptoms before/after OIT treatment. The symptoms of allergic diarrhea were assessed 1 h after non-heated OVA challenge, and the severity was classified as follows: normal stool, soft stool, loose stool, mild diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and fluid stool. Mice showing profuse liquid stool (mild diarrhea, severe diarrhea, or fluid stool) were recorded as having diarrhea.",

In addition, there is ample evidence indicating that peripheral mucosal immune systems interact with each other through the common mucosal immune system [46]. Therefore, it is suggested that some administration routes for immune tolerance induction are effective in the treatment of food allergy. In fact, it has been reported that OIT and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) have a promise for the treatment of food allergy [47]. However, to date, OIT is more effective in inducing tolerance than EPIT and the efficacy of EPIT is not enough for the treatment of food allergy [48]. In addition, OIT utilizes the pathway of oral tolerance that is physiological immune responses to ingested food antigens. Therefore, we selected OIT for further studies.",

To further elucidate the involvement of mast cells in mediating the effects of OIT and OIT+kakkonto, we measured plasma levels of mMCP-1as a marker of mast cell degranulation [25] and observed that the plasma mMCP-1levels tended to decrease in OIT mice and further significantly decreased in OIT+kakkonto mice; these changes were closely correlated with the allergic symptoms and Th2 immune response-related gene expression.",

Additionally, induction of Tregs in murine models has been postulated to be an essential step in allergen-specific immunotherapy [25\u201328]. In 2012, Maazi et al. demonstrated that the effects of allergen-specific immunotherapy can be partially explained by Tregs because depletion of Tregs only partially abrogated the suppressive effects induced by the therapy [58]. Furthermore, Hadis et al. have demonstrated that oral OVA administration induces the local expansion of antigen-specific Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in the LP, but neither the MLN nor the peripheral lymph nodes using OT-II T cell adoptive transfer mouse model and that the antigen-specific Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in the LP contribute to the induction of immune tolerance [59]. Therefore, in this study, to further elucidate the immunomodulating effects of OIT and OIT+kakkonto, we assessed the proportion of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in the LP following these treatments. Indeed, in our models, we found an increase in the proportion of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs following OIT, which was similar to other reports employing different models of allergic disease; notably, this increase was markedly enhanced by OIT+kakkonto. A number of recent reports have demonstrated that RA, the active metabolite of vitamin A, can enhance the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Tregs both in vitro and in vivo [34\u201337]. In addition, oral administration of vitamin A [60] and subcutaneous administration of RA [61] result in increased number of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in LP, indicating that RA is a positive regulatory factor for the generation of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in the intestine. In this study, we showed RA-dependent differentiation of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in the co-culture of DCs and naive T cells. The concentrations of RA in cells and tissues are regulated by RA metabolism. Cytochrome P450 CYP26 enzymes are primarily responsible for RA degradation [62, 63]. Therefore, suppression of CYP26 enzymes can increase endogenous RA concentrations [63, 64], which enhance differentiation of Tregs [65]. Furthermore, CRABP1 can bind to RA, and transfer and present RA to CYP26 for the degradation [34]. In this study, OIT+kakkonto significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of CYP26B1 and CRABP1, suggesting that OIT+kakkonto may increase RA concentration and thereby induce Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in the LP of the colon.",

            "text": "Treg responses to allergens are associated with the suppression of the effector cells of allergic symptoms, such as mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils [54]. These cells essentially require T-cell cytokines for their priming, survival and activity, but the Th2 cells that were suppressed by activated Tregs in FA mice treated with OIT or with OIT+kakkonto did not efficiently provide these T-cell cytokines. Additionally, through direct Treg-mast cell contact, Tregs limited the degranulation of mast cells. Conversely, it has been reported that the Fc\u03b5RI signaling blockade in mast cells induces functional Tregs, promotes tolerance induction and prevents food allergen sensitization in a murine peanut FA model [74]. Furthermore, adoptive transfer studies show that infusion of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs results in decreased serum mMCP-1 levels in a FA model [75], indicating that constitutive Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs are sufficient to modulate the efferent phase of allergic reactions mediated by mast cells. Based on these observations, Tregs in mice treated with OIT or with OIT+kakkonto can inactivate mucosal mast cells, which play the most pivotal role in the pathogenesis of FAs [76] through various mechanisms, thereby inducing tolerance to food antigens and suppressing FAs.",
