As examples, in medicinal chemistry substituted benzotriazoles have been evaluated as inhibitors of respiratory syncytial virus [1], halogenated benzotriazoles have been shown to inhibit helicase activity of hepatitis C [2], N-alkylbenzotriazoles were shown to be active and selective towards HCV NTPase/helicase [3]. Benzotriazoles also possess anti-amoebic properties, particularly against the human pathogen Acanthamoeba that can infect a variety of organs such as brain, eyes, skin, and lungs [4]. Triazole and benzotriazole derivatives have been evaluated as antitumor agents, with several showing high activities [5], and a benzotriazole derivative was shown to inhibit proliferation of hepatocarcinoma [6]. Several N-alkylbenzotriazoles show potent antimicrobial action [7] and others have been evaluated as aromatase inhibitors [8]. Benzotriazole derivatives have also been reported to be inhibitors of MAP kinases [9]. Although esters of BtOH are generally intermediates in amide synthesis, stable ones have recently been evaluated against the new coronavirus responsible for SARS, and several compounds were shown to be irreversible inhibitors of the viral proteinase 3CLpro (also called Mpro) [10]. Benzotriazoles with ether linkages on the phenyl ring have been reported to be promising entities in the treatment of glutamate mGluR2 receptor dysfunction-related diseases, such as neurological and psychological disorders [11].",

In that work, analysis of the reaction course by 31P{1H} NMR did not show the formation of a new phosphorus signal other than that for HMPA, which is a reaction byproduct. However, prior investigations by others [23\u201324] and by us [25\u201327] have demonstrated the formation of phosphonium ions by the reaction of BOP with the oxygen atoms in amide linkages of purines and related heterocycles. In fact, related to these observations we have demonstrated the isolation and synthetic utility of a nucleoside phosphonium salt [28]. Thus, to us the reaction of oximes with BOP was an intriguing result, leading us to query whether a benzotriazolyl intermediate, rather than a phosphonium ion, was formed en route to the cyanide. This line of reasoning would then suggest that 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles may indeed be obtainable from the reactions of alcohols with BOP, and that different reaction pathways may be operative depending upon the nature of the nucleophile (Scheme 2). However, the formation of 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles by such an approach appeared implausible on the basis of prior observations, where no reaction of BOP with the free hydroxy groups of nucleosides was observed [23,25].",

Some notable results are as follows. Despite the leaving group ability of BtO\u2212, elimination to styrene does not appear to be a significant problem in the reactions with the isomeric phenylethanols (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). Not unexpectedly, reaction with 1,3-butanediol occurred predominantly at the 1\u00b0 hydroxy group (Table 2, entry 12). The reaction with propargyl alcohol proceeded uneventfully (Table 2, entry 14). The reaction of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (Table 2, entry 15) was complicated by the formation of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. This can potentially occur by benzylic deprotonation, due to the enhanced acidity of these protons in 1o or a reactive intermediate. Such a problem was not encountered in the reactions of other benzylic alcohols. Use of K2CO3 in place of DBU did not ameliorate this problem encountered with 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol. However, use of slightly modified conditions resulted in the formation of the desired product 1o in good yield (see Supporting Information File 1 for details). Reaction of phenol with Bt-OTs resulted in the formation of the phenyl tosylate (Table 2, entry 16), indicating the potential use of this reagent as a tosylating agent for phenols. The outcome in the phenol reaction may be linked to the potential reaction pathway, an aspect that is described below. However, because phenoxide is a softer nucleophile as compared to alkoxide, we had to consider whether this was a factor in the reaction mechanism.",

            "text": "With this mechanistic rationale two reactions of BOP were conducted in parallel with PhCH2OH as well as PhCH2[18O]H and DBU. The product yields from both reactions were nearly identical (ca 39%). High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the ratio of the peak areas [M + 2]+/[M]+ was 0.015 for products from both reactions. Pathway a alone can account for this result and it appears that no leakage occurs via pathways b and c. A comparable [18O]-labeling experiment was conducted with Bt-OTs, where again no incorporation of the label was observed in the product, and the ratio of the peak areas [M + 2]+/[M]+ was 0.014. These results showed that both reagents, BOP and Bt-OTs, appear to react via similar pathways, not involving direct reactions at either the N1 or N3 atom in the benzotriazole ring. In support of this inference, a reaction of Bt-OTs with allyl alcohol was conducted at \u221278 \u00b0C. Quenching this reaction after 30 min, followed by preparative TLC of a portion of the mixture, led to the isolation of the allyl alcohol tosylate [32\u201333]. However, even at this low temperature, formation of 1-(allyloxy)-1H-benzotriazole (1c) was clearly evident, indicating the ease of this transformation. In the light of these results, the reaction of phenol with Bt-OTs is consistent with the proposed pathway a, and it appears that both alkoxides and phenoxides react in a similar manner. The mechanistic basis in reactions of alcohols with BOP and Bt-OTs described above appears to parallel that reported for the activation of carboxylic acids by BOP. In the carboxylic acid activation studies, only two mechanisms were proposed, namely reaction of the carboxylate at the phosphorus center (equivalent to pathway a in Scheme 3) or a SN2\u2019 reaction at the N3 atom (equivalent to pathway b in Scheme 3) [34]. Experiments with [18O]-labeled benzoate indicated that conversion of carboxylic acids to the acyl HOBt derivatives occurs by a two-step process, via an intermediate acyloxyphosphonium ion [34].",

However, this appears to be the only example of a BtOH derivative in Pd-mediated reactions. In principle, formation of \u03c0\u2013allyl complexes from allylic benzotriazolyloxy products described herein should be feasible. In this context, N-allylbenzotriazole derivatives undergo reaction with preformed enamines, in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 and PPh3 [37]. Super-stoichiometric ZnBr2 was necessary for these reactions, in the absence of which no reaction was observed [37]. With these data in mind, we decided to evaluate a few reactions of cinnamyloxy benzotriazolyl derivative 1g. However, instead of using preformed enamines, we chose to utilize a combination of metal- and organocatalysis, wherein the enamine is formed in situ [38]. Exposure of 1.5 molar equiv each of cyclohexanone, N-benzylpiperidone, and 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone to compound 1g, Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mol %), and pyrrolidine (30 mol %) in DMSO at room temperature, led to the corresponding \u03b3,\u03b4-unsaturated cycloalkanones (Fig. 4).",

In the presence of iPr2NEt, reaction of HATU with benzyl-, n-butyl-, and p-nitrobenzyl alcohol led to the formation of the corresponding 1-alkoxy-1H-7-azabenzotriazoles [39]. The regiochemistry in these reactions was identical to that reported here. What is notable about reagents such as HBTU and HATU is that they are commonly encountered in the guanidinium (N form) rather than the uronium (O form). Although the uronium form can be synthesized and is a more reactive species, it undergoes rapid isomerization to the guanidinium form in the presence of bases [40]. Thus, it can be reasonably anticipated that formation of Bt-OR and At-OR from the reactions of alcohols with HBTU and HATU would proceed via the intermediacy of a uronium salt of the alcohol, leading to a regiochemical outcome with unsymmetrical reagents as shown in Scheme 6.",

Although reactions of alcohols proceeded with (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and DBU, Bt-OTs was a more effective reagent. Correspondingly, the 7-aza derivatives were synthesized from At-OTs. Methodologically, this one-step process allows for the direct conversion of alcohols to N-alkoxy benzo- and azabenzotriazoles, eliminating the necessity for alkyl halides or more cumbersome methods. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions of alcohols with these peptide-coupling reagents, in the presence of a base, appear to proceed by formation of alcohol phosphonium derivatives (with BOP), or alcohol tosylates (with Bt-OTs), and not through direct displacement of the leaving group by attack at the N1 or by a SN2\u2019-type of process by reaction at the N3 of the triazolyl moiety. The mechanistic analyses were conducted by a combination of 31P{1H}, [18O]-labeling, and other chemical experiments. The reaction of phenol with Bt-OTs yielded only the phenyl tosylate, which is consistent with this mechanism. This reaction also shows that Bt-OTs (and At-OTs) could serve as tosylating agents for phenols as well. Further, the utilities of this reaction, as well as some of the products have been explored. In this vein, acyclic nucleoside-like compounds containing benzo- and azabenzotriazole as a nucleobase surrogate have been synthesized. Because benzotriazole derivatives have potentially important pharmacological applications, we anticipate expansion of this chemistry in the future to a broader range of nucleoside-like entities for biological assays. The ability of BtO\u2212 to function as a nucleofuge, led us to explore its displacement. In this context, several 1-alkoxy-1H-benzotriazoles obtained from benzylic alcohols underwent substitution reaction with a range of nucleophiles, and a simple alkyl derivative also underwent reaction although the reaction was slightly incomplete. Finally, we have evaluated the departure of BtO\u2212 from an allylic position leading to a putative Pd \u03c0\u2013allyl complex. In unoptimized preliminary results, Pd-catalyzed \u03b1-allylation of three cyclic ketones was accomplished with a cinnamyloxy benzotriazolyl derivative, through in situ formed pyrrolidine enamines. Overall, the potential scope of this new chemistry appears promising, ranging from the development of novel molecules with new applications, to synthetic methodology. We anticipate reporting additional developments in this area in the future.",

Specific experimental and work-up details are provided under the individual compound headings.",
