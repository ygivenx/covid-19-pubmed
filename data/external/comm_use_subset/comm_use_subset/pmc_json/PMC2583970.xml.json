Among its biotic pathologies, cotton blue disease (CBD) plays an important role due to its worldwide distribution and the high-magnitude of its associated productivity losses. Cotton blue disease was first described in the Central African Republic in 1949. It is transmitted by the aphid Aphis gossypii and its symptoms include leaf rolling, intense green foliage, vein yellowing, and a severe to moderate stunting caused by internodal shortening. Similar symptoms have also been observed in cotton crops of several regions of Africa, Asia and the Americas [1]. In Brazil, CBD is a serious crop problem capable of reducing the productivity of susceptible varieties by up to 80%, if intensive insecticidal control is not properly performed during the growing season. Losses of up to 1,500 kg\u00b7ha-1 of cotton seed have been reported in some states [2].",

In Brazil, the disease is associated with a virus from the family Luteoviridae, genus Polerovirus, named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) [3]. Viruses from the family Luteoviridae are icosahedral and have a positive-sense RNA genome of ~6 Kb. These viruses are transmitted by aphids in a circulative and persistent manner [4], and are restricted to the phloem cells of their hosts. The Luteoviridae family is comprised of three genera, Luteovirus, Polerovirus, and Enamovirus, that are divided based on differences in their RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and structural proteins.",

ORF0 encodes a silencing suppressor protein, P0 [6], and ORFs1 and 2 encode proteins related to viral replication, including the viral RNA polymerase [5]. Between the non-structural and structural protein sequences exists an intergenic region (IR) involved in subgenomic RNA synthesis [5,7,8]. The major coat protein (CP) is encoded by ORF3 at the 3' portion of the genome. The viral movement protein is encoded by ORF4, which lies within the CP gene sequence but in another reading frame [9]. ORF5 is expressed by occasional suppression of the CP termination codon [10] and encodes the read-through domain (RTD) required for efficient aphid transmission [11,12]",

Here we map for the first time the genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazilian cotton fields covering the most important producer regions. Analyzing 23 new viral isolates, we observed a low diversity in the CP CLRDV gene. However, phylogenetic analysis of this sequence revealed a small genetic distance between CV2, PO1, and PL3 and the other CLRDV isolates, clustering them in different groups. These results may suggest a co-adaptation phenomenon, resulting from selection pressure, among the divergent and the other CLRDV isolates, giving rise very similar CP sequences. Indeed, evolutionary studies concerning the CP of Luteoviridae members show that this protein is subjected to various selection pressures [22]. The CP is directly associated with the success of infection, as it is involved in viral transmission, particle packaging, and viral accumulation within the plant [23,24].

Moreover, the IR between the RdRp and CP sequences from divergent isolates have 187 nt, the same as that in CLRDV [3]. Thus, their IRs resemble those of Polerovirus members, which are ~200 nt long, and differ from those of Luteovirus members, which are ~100 nt long. Taken together, these data suggest that the three divergent isolates could result from recombination events between CLRDV ancestors and another member of the genus Polerovirus. Evidence of recombination was found using three different methods (Simplot, GARD, and Bootscan). However, we were unable to detect a parental sequence for PL3, CV2, or PO1. Thus, the Polerovirus member involved in recombination with CLRDV remains unknown.",

RNA recombination event(s) probably created the divergence observed between the genera Luteovirus and Polerovirus [25]. Subsequent recombination events between polerovirus-polerovirus [26] and luteovirus-polerovirus [27,28] have occurred since the birth of these genera [5,25]. Recombination sites in the family appear to coincide with the starting points for subgenomic RNA synthesis in the IR [7]. Comparisons among the IR sequences of BWYV, PLRV, and BYDV RNAs revealed two spots that are apparently conserved in all viruses. These regions contain a repeated UnA signature that is usually associated with the formation of subgenomic RNAs [7,8]. Our data suggest that the recombination event found in the three divergent isolates occurred downstream of the second recombination spot of the IR (Figure 3B). Consistent with this, crossover events at the same region have already been described for a bovine coronavirus [29].",

The molecular criterion used for species discrimination [30] in the family Luteoviridae states that amino acid sequences from any viral gene product exceeding 10% divergence should be regarded as a new species. Furthermore, symptomatology differences are also an important criterion for species discrimination. Therefore, our results suggest that PL3, CV2, and PO1 should be considered isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus. Further studies on CBD are necessary to understand the taxonomic and epidemiological relationships between the viruses associated with this important disease.",
