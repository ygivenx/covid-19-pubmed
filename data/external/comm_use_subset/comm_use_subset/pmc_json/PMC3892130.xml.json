Because the etiology is unknown, several MS animal models are used. The most common MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is an autoimmune driven CNS demyelinating disease [12] that also exhibits neuronal damage [13-15]. Another MS model is induced by infection with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), MHV-A59 [16,17]. While MHV-A59 induces CNS inflammation and demyelination similar to EAE, the etiology is distinct, involving direct neuronal infection, and the demyelination is not dependant on an intact immune system [18]. Therefore, these models provide unique and contrasting systems for studying potential neuroprotective strategies for MS.",

Due to differences in replication and elimination, these doses result in equivalent viral loads in the CNS, and inoculation of each strain was performed as described previously [31,32]. Mice were monitored daily for mortality and signs of disease [16,17]. Mock-infected controls were inoculated similarly but with an uninfected cell lysate at a comparable dilution. SRTAW04 (Sirtris, a GSK company, Cambridge, MA) was prepared in PBS containing 0.5% methyl cellulose and 0.1% tween 80. Mice were treated with SRTAW04, 100 mg/kg/mouse/day by oral gavage. The dose was chosen based on previously measured pharmacokinetics of the drug and its ability to activate SIRT1 which has been used previously with maximal effects [27,33,34]. Seven day and 30 day treatment groups received SRTAW04 starting from day 1 until sacrifice. To evaluate whether the SRTAW04 target is SIRT1 and its activation, one group of mice received SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 30 days [35]. EX527 has the highest inhibitory activity for SIRT1 compared to other analogues and previous studies have shown that EX527 treatment alone does not result in the acetylation of SIRT1/2 target p53 [36,37]. We have previously shown that SIRT1 inhibitors or conditional deletion of the SIRT1 gene, do not exacerbate RGC loss in optic nerve disease models [24,38].",

Briefly, 2.5 \u03bcL of 1.25% hydroxystilbamidine (Fluorogold; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in sterile water was injected stereotactically into each superior colliculus through holes drilled in the skull. Mice were killed 7 or 30 days after infection and each eye was removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Retinas were isolated, prepared as flattened wholemounts, viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and photographed at 20X magnification in 12 standard fields: 1/6, 3/6, and 5/6 of the retinal radius from the center of the retina in each quadrant. RGC numbers shown in each experiment represent the total number of RGCs counted per eye (RGCs/0.74 mm2). RGCs were counted by a masked investigator using image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 5.0; Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Alternatively, to confirm RGC numbers, RGC\u2019s were immunolabelled with antibodies to Brn3a. Retinas were dissected and flat as previously reported [39]. The retinas were washed with PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% TritonX 100 in PBS by freezing them for 15 min at \u221270\u00b0C, rinsed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with goat-antiBrn3a antibody (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer (PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% Triton X 100). The retinas were washed three times in PBS, incubated for 2 hours at room temperature (RT) with anti-goat secondary antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer, washed in PBS and mounted vitreous side up on slides in anti-fading solution. Cells were counted in 12 fields as described above for fluorogold labeled RGCs.",

Spinal cord tissues were sectioned at 5 \u03bcm and stained with either Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) to detect demyelination or with anti-neurofilament antibodies to detect loss of axons. Areas of demyelination in LFB staining were quantified using a 0\u20133 point scale as described earlier [21] 0 - no demyelination; 1 - rare foci of demyelination; 2 - a few foci of demyelination; and 3 - large (confluent) areas of demyelination. Two to three sections were examined from each of three spinal cord levels (cervical, thoracic and lumbar) for each mouse. Neurofilament staining was done according to a previously published protocol [40]. Briefly, paraffin embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and then permeabilized with 0.5% tween-20 in PBS. The sections were blocked with blocking reagent from Vectastain Elite ABC kit and then incubated in the rabbit anti-neurofilament antibody 1:100 (AbCam) at 4\u00b0C overnight, washed, and incubated with goat biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 2 hours at RT. The ABC detection was performed using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit and DAB (diaminobenzidine) substrate kit (both Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. To characterize virus induced inflammation, spinal cords from 7 day p.i. mice were stained with H&E as described previously [21,32] and scored using an inflammation scale: 0 - no inflammation, 0.5 - few inflammatory cells, 1 - inflammatory cells localized near white matter, 1.5 - small patches of inflammatory cells, 2 - large inflammatory plaques, 3 - diffuse inflammation. Experiments were repeated three times with 3\u20135 mice in each group. All slides were coded and read in a blinded manner. 30 days p.i. spinal cord sections were also stained with a macrophage/microglial marker anti-Iba1 (Wako, Japan) as described previously [18].

The ability of SRTAW04 to attenuate neuronal loss in MHV-A59 infected mice was therefore examined. RGCs of 4 week old C57BL/6 mice were labeled with fluorogold and mice were inoculated with MHV-A59 one week later. The treatment group was administered SRTAW04 (100 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage starting from day 1 for 30 days. The decrease in RGC numbers in untreated MHV-A59 mice, compared to controls, was significantly attenuated by SRTAW04 treatment (Figure 3a). To further confirm the neuroprotective effect of SRTAW04, 4 week old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with recombinant strain of MHV, RSA59 and the treatment group was administered the same dose of SRTAW04 for 30 days with and without SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (10 mg/kg/day i.p.). After 30 days RGCs were labeled by Brn3a staining and counted. Consistent with MHV-A59 results (Figure 3a) RSA59 induced a significant decrease in RGCs and treatment with SRTAW04 attenuated RGC loss. The SRTAW04 treatment group receiving EX527 showed a significant decrease in RGC numbers compared to the group that only received SRTAW04 (Figure 3b, c) demonstrating that the RGC protective effect of SRTAW04 is dependent on SIRT1. Treatment with SIRT1 inhibitor alone does not further reduce RGC survival (data not shown), similar to prior studies [24,38].",

SDH is a key mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the Krebs cycle, and feeds electrons to the respiratory chain ubiquinone (UQ) pool [43]. SDH functions not only in mitochondrial energy generation, but also has a role in oxygen sensing [44]. Protein levels of SDHb showed a significant decrease in the MHV-A59 infected group compared to controls. Treatment with SRTAW04 for seven days showed a significant increase of SDHb protein expression when compared to untreated MHV-A59 infected mice in both optic nerve and retina (Figure 6a,b,d). We also measured protein expression of SOD2, a mitochondrial protein which binds to superoxide byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and converts them to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen [45]. Results showed a significant decrease in expression of SOD2 in optic nerves and retinas of MHV-A59 infected mice and treatment with SRTAW04 significantly attenuated that change (Figure 6a,c,e). The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) co-activator 1-\u03b1 (PGC1-\u03b1) is a transcriptional co-activator identified as an upstream regulator of mitochondrial number and function [46] and is activated by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation [26]. Results showed a significant decrease in PGC1-\u03b1 expression during MHV-A59 infection, and treatment with SRTAW04 significantly increases the protein levels in retinas of 7 day treated mice (Figure 6a,f). PGC1-\u03b1 levels in optic nerve were too low to be detected.",

Since tissue is limited in optic nerve, histologic studies were also performed using spinal cord, which has larger areas of white matter, to assess effects of SRTAW04 on demyelination. Spinal cords were isolated from mice infected with RSA59 for 30 days, treated with or without 100 mg/kg SRTAW04 daily, and demyelination levels were measured using LFB staining. Pathology was assessed in five to seven cross-sections of spinal cord from cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. Demyelinating plaques were quantified on a 0 to 3 scale in four quadrants from two spinal cord levels for each mouse. Spinal cord sections from the RSA59 infected group showed a significant increase in the demyelinating score compared to control and RSMHV2 infected groups (Figure 7a,b,d,f). The group receiving SRTAW04 showed a significant decrease in the demyelinating score compared to RSA59 infected group (Figure 7a,f, h). In contrast, SRTAW04 treated mice that also received the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 did not show a significant reduction in demyelination (Figure 7a, f-j). Serial sections were stained with antibodies for neurofilament and show focal axonal degeneration only in the areas of demyelination. (Figure 7c,e,g,i,k)",

SIRT1 activating compound SRTAW04 significantly attenuates neuronal loss induced by MHV-A59 and RSA59 infection. Similar neuroprotective effects mediated by several SIRT1 activators were previously demonstrated in two different EAE models of MS, relapsing/remitting EAE in SJL/J mice [23,24] and chronic EAE in C57BL/6 mice [22], but the mechanism of these effects was not assessed beyond the role of activating SIRT1. The current results suggest SIRT1 activators can work by promoting mitochondrial function and reducing the accumulation of ROS. While such oxidative stress has been demonstrated previously in EAE [28,30], it was not clear whether similar mechanisms would be found in the MHV induced demyelinating disease. While we found that SIRT1 activation is associated with reduced accumulation of ROS in optic nerves, one limitation of this study that will be addressed in future studies is that a causal relation of this effect has not been confirmed using ROS inhibitors as positive controls.",

Axonal injury and loss of neurons in relapsing/remitting EAE occurs secondary to inflammation [47,48], predominantly mediated by effector T cells, whereas neurotropic strains of MHV can directly infect neurons leading to direct injury, and leading to myelin stripping by activated microglia/macrophages [18]. MHV induced disease also occurs even in the absence of lymphocytes [49]. The ability of SIRT1 activators to prevent neuronal loss in both models therefore suggests they modulate a common mechanism of neurodegeneration downstream of the initial mechanisms of injury. SIRT1 activators appear to work by increasing expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and reduction of ROS, and indicate these are important targets for neuroprotective therapies. Consistent with this, SIRT1 activators were found to have similar neuroprotective effects in a model of traumatic optic nerve injury [38].",

A role for resveratrol and SIRT1 in neuroprotection has been suggested in other neurodegenerative processes besides demyelinating disease, including models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [51,52], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [52], and axotomized dorsal root ganglion cells [50]. However, resveratrol also modulates a variety of cellular signaling pathways independent of its ability to activate SIRT1, exerting a number of potentially beneficial effects including anti-carcinogenic properties, anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators and/or activated immune cells, and inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cycooxygenase-2 [53,54]. For the current studies, we used the SIRT1 activator SRTAW04 to avoid activating other pathways affected by resveratrol. In addition, compounds like SRTAW04 that activate SIRT1 by distinct mechanisms from resveratrol exert similar SIRT1 activation levels at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than resveratrol [33], and have shown good safety profiles in early phase clinical trials. In addition, we have shown previously that SRTAW04 itself prevents oxidative stress-induced loss of neurons in vitro [27].",

SIRT1 was originally identified as a histone deacetylase [55,56], leading to large changes in overall gene expression, but SIRT1 also has been found to deacetylate a number of other protein targets [57,58], including transcription factors that may directly affect expression of specific genes. In addition, post-translational modifications of mitochondrial enzymes may further promote mitochondrial biogenesis, as SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of PGC1-\u03b1 has been shown to do in muscle cells [26]. Results here show that transient increases in SIRT1 activity following administration of SRTAW04 were capable of providing long-term neuroprotective effects in MHV-A59 infected mice, suggesting that deacetylation of SIRT1 substrates may persist beyond the timing of acute SIRT1 activation.",

Treatment with SRTAW04 (n = 8) significantly (@p < 0.05) attenuated the increase in superoxide anion staining induced during MHV-A59 (n = 6) infection relative to controls (*p < 0.05). (c) Representative images show optic nerves stained with MitoSOX Red 30 days after infection with MHV-A59. There is increased staining in MHV-A59 infected optic nerve compared to control optic nerve, with less staining present in optic nerve from an MHV-A59 infected mouse treated with SRTAW04 (100 mg/kg/day) for 30 days.
