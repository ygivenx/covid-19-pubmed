Some focus on identifying influenza-like-illness (ILI) in clinical and other settings, while others search the Internet to identify disease outbreaks that might not have been recognized by the authorities [3, 4]. Having found high correlations with traditional surveillance systems and noting the benefits of timeliness and low cost, Internet-based surveillance systems have been widely recognized as important supplementary data sources for influenza surveillance [5].",

Our research has shown that decisions made by patients, healthcare providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing healthcare and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which we define as the information the population is exposed to through media, the Internet, social networks, and so forth. And since the information environment changes constantly, surveillance data systems that depend on decisions by patients and health professionals are likely to be biased, possibly in different ways [6, 7]. Epidemiologists and public health practitioners typically recognize these potential biases qualitatively, and present their analysis of the available data with appropriate caveats. Public health practitioners and clinicians are also aware of the surge in medical resource utilization caused by the \u201cworried well\u201d in response to media coverage of disease outbreaks [8]. Awareness of these biases is often lost, however, at higher levels [9].",

In particular, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model that allows us to examine the relationship between surveillance data and information environment more formally than our previous analyses [6, 7].

Rather than thinking of influenza-related web queries and news being direct indicators of disease transmission in the population, we view them as indicators of the information environment. We built a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to estimate the correspondence between individual surveillance data and the information environment proxy data. Although not employed in this analysis, the model has the potential to incorporate epidemiological expertise through informed prior distributions. The findings have enabled us to understand how each surveillance system is related to the information environment and disease status, which should eventually help public health practitioners interpret the influenza surveillance data for situational awareness purposes, as well as prioritizing resources to different surveillance systems given the specific decision-making needs.",

The out-patient ILI surveillance network reports the proportion of outpatients with ILI [Fever (>38\u00b0C, oral or equivalent) AND Cough or sore throat] on weekly basis [13, 14]. During the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection (pH1N1) outbreak, eight designated flu clinics (DFC) were operated from June 13th 2009 to May 23rd 2010 [15], while the general out-patient clinics data were interrupted [16]. Hospital Authority, a public-sector organization that oversees all public hospitals, manages over 95% of the in-patient care [17]. The weekly numbers of hospitalization with principle diagnosis of pneumonia and influenza (P&I; ICD9 480\u2012487) and influenza (ICD9 487) were obtained from the Hospital Authority for age groups of 0-4,5-14,15-64 and \u226565 years. Respiratory specimens from sentinel out-patient clinics, general practitioners are routinely submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Centre (PHLC) of CHP for sentinel surveillance purpose, while specimens from other out-patient healthcare facilities and hospitals are routinely submitted to the PHLC for diagnostic purposes [13]. Weekly data on numbers of specimen received, numbers of specimen tested positive for influenza and proportion of specimen tested positive were obtained from PHLC for 1997-2009. Reliable estimates of weekly incidence rate of pH1N1 for age groups (5-14,15-19,20-29,30-39,40-49, 50-59) were constructed based on serological data and hospitalization data [18].

The heterogeneity in the disease transmission dynamics and the informational environment is less likely to be attributable to the geographic variability. Therefore, the influenza surveillance systems are presumably monitoring a relatively homogenous population under the same informational environment, which is an important presumption for this modeling approach. Also, in addition to the normal winter-spring peak, Hong Kong usually experiences a summer peak in July to August [19], which potentially doubles the data volume. Since 2004, the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) has been monitoring influenza activity using multiple surveillance systems summarized in a weekly surveillance dashboard. These include sentinel surveillance system based at Accidents and Emergency Department of public hospitals, private medical practitioners, general outpatient clinics, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, childcare centres and kindergartens and residential care homes for the elderly, as well as more traditional laboratory and influenza-related hospitalization surveillance systems. Given the variety of data types available, as well as the availability of reliable estimate of incidence rate based on serological study during pandemic period as gold standard [18], Hong Kong is chosen for this project.",

January to March and July to August are then defined as flu season, while the remaining periods are referred as non-flu season. The sole exception is the summer of 2007 when the flu activity in multiple data streams started peaking before July; the flu season is therefore readjusted to begin at week 25 instead of week 27 of 2007.

Also, when replaced the incidence rate of all-age with 5-14 yr, data fits better for flu-HA, general practitioner ILI-visits, notifiable infectious disease reporting and P&I-HA(0-15 yr) (Additional file 1: Table S9). During the pandemic flu outbreak, since the children and young adults were considered to be at higher risk than the elderly, physicians may tend to order more laboratory testing for pediatric patients [7]. During the non-pandemic period, the same clinical practice might still prevail. Since pediatric mortality is a reportable condition, clinicians are more likely to order laboratory tests and use a specific diagnostic code if the test results are positive. The elderly patients, however, who usually have non-specific clinical manifestation for respiratory diseases and lower viral loads [46], are less likely to be sampled, less likely to have a positive result if tested, and usually given a less specific diagnostic code such as \u201cpneumonia and influenza\u201d.",

Advances in information technology have made a wide range of data available to public health researchers and practitioners, offering the promise of improving current surveillance systems, generating more sensitive and timely warnings of disease outbreak or providing more accurate estimates of disease transmission. For this potential to be realized, however, the characteristics of these new data sources must be understood before they are used in sophisticated statistical models. Olson and colleagues have suggested, for instance, that Google Flu Trends\u2019 impressive retrospective correlation with ILI surveillance data may be a product of over-fitting by \u201cfishing\u201d through numerous search term combinations as part of data mining. Moreover, Google Flu Trends\u2019 tendency to miss the beginning of an outbreak and its poor accuracy at the local level also limits its application in providing early warning and situational awareness [37]. The importance of understanding the nature of the data and the environment in which the data is generated may be overshadowed by researchers\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 enthusiasm for data availability (i.e. \u201cbig data\u201d) and purely statistical patterns (often ignoring confounding variables or underlying processes).",

For instance, individuals who are aware of the on-going transmission of influenza are likely to search for information for prevention and self-diagnosis purposes, and may tend to seek medical attention once feeling sick. Thus, although it has not been recognized and studied systemically, many influenza surveillance systems may reflect changes in the information environment as well as actual disease trends. And although the data we analysed are all from Hong Kong, the underlying mechanisms are not specific to that region, so the problem may be widespread. Indeed, Zhang and colleagues and Stoto found similar patterns using less formal methods in the United States [6, 7].",

Other than Google searches, correlation between social media (e.g. Twitter) and similar data with traditional flu surveillance data may only indicate that both are reflecting the same information environment, rather the social media data reflecting actual disease status. Often times they are not clearly distinguished; and, people readily jump to the conclusion that the information environment data can be used as a proxy for disease status. As shown in our study, such an approach has its limitations. Information environment data such as web queries and tweets in fact have dual usage, (1) as proxy for direct estimate for disease, and (2) as covariates to control the model for public awareness biases. When researchers promote the idea of using the Internet data for disease surveillance among practitioners, the differentiation was not made clearly, and sometimes is lost when being communicated to the general public. Our study provides a framework to understand how the information environment data is related to the traditional surveillance data, which will help to fine tune the usage of information environment data.",
