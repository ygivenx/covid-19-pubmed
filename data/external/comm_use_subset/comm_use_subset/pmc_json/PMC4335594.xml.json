Follow-up docking studies suggested that these compounds may have favorable inhibitory interactions with this receptor. VP35 is a cofactor in the RNA polymerase transcription complex, and helps the virus evade the immune response by blocking activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3, which is required for the induction of interferons alpha and beta. Thus, blocking VP35 should allow for an enhancement of the host immune response to the Ebola virus. It is proposed that similar compounds may be acting via a closely related mechanism, though there has been no experimental evidence to directly prove this yet.",

Brincidofovir is thought to mimic cytidine, a building block of DNA, and thereby inhibit viral DNA polymerases, and its mechanism of action against the Ebola virus, an RNA virus, is yet unknown. Brincidofovir, which has demonstrated safety in humans, has been given to at least two Ebola virus patients, one in Dallas and one in Nebraska. While unfortunately the Dallas patient died, the Nebraska patient survived\n24. It is of course too early to know the effect of this molecule on the progression of the disease. This compound is a pro-drug that is converted into the active antiviral, cidofovir diphosphate. Brincidofovir has higher oral bioavailability, intracellular concentrations of drug and increased antiviral potency\n22. This compound only appeared in the literature in 2014 and there is very little published information.",

For example, a novel nucleoside analog, BCX4430 demonstrated efficacy in mice and non-human primates against the Ebola virus\n25. This compound targets viral RNA polymerase activity by inducing early termination of transcription and thus blocking replication. BCX4430 is not only active against Ebola virus, but also targets other members of the Filovirus family as well as 8 other RNA virus families. Because of the potent and efficacious effects, BCX4430 is being fast-tracked for clinical trials in humans.",

The chemist\u2019s (C.A.L.) decisions on compound quality are summarized in\nSupplemental Table 1. In contrast to the previous work in scoring compounds as chemical probes, the current aim is very specific - to treat a very serious viral disease for which there is a phenotypic readout. All the known drugs in clinical use were rejected as the chemist looked for compounds that looked more interesting in his opinion. Only 16 out of 55 were selected as desirable in this analysis with no potential problems based on medicinal chemistry experience. In addition to this manual approach, we applied computational filters such as Pan Assay INterference compoundS (PAINS) to identify potentially problematic compounds from structures\n28,\n29 (\nSupplemental Table 1). PAINS analysis was enabled using the MMDS mobile app\n30. Based on this approach we have identified several molecules that appear problematic and agreed with the medicinal chemistry analysis. For example 4 molecules appear to fail the PAINS filters, including the rhodanine compound LJ-001 which was found to be active against numerous enveloped viruses and was found through a screen of inhibitors of Nipah virus entry (IC\n50 1\u03bcM)\n31.\nIn vivo a steady state plasma concentration could not be maintained at a therapeutic level. Rhodanines are known to be problematic PAINS compounds\n28,\n29. Interestingly amodiaquine was not scored favorably by PAINS or the medicinal chemist, yet this is a successful antimalarial drug.",

We think this research can learn from other areas in which there are currently efforts to improve collaboration and screening. In the area of Tuberculosis research, funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The European Commission have enabled the TB Drug Accelerator and the More Medicines For Tuberculosis, as large-scale collaborations between academia, research institutes and industry. These collaborations have promoted the selective sharing of related data in a secure environment between collaborators using the CDD Vault\n32 (\nFigure 1). The centralized availability of publicly available data on compounds screened for activity against\nMycobacterium tuberculosis enables researchers to leverage the existing literature alongside their private data. This knowledge can be used for building of validated computational models that can help in selecting additional compounds or lead optimization\n33,\n34, saving time and effort. By organizing the data on small molecules tested against the Ebola virus similarly in a central database and using machine learning models based on public data may help identify additional compounds for testing. Such an effort may also prevent duplication of efforts as we have seen with the screening of multiple libraries of FDA approved compounds against the Ebola Virus\n14\u2013\n16. In order to catalyze this we have made the 55 compounds (\nSupplemental Table 1) freely available as a dataset in CDD Public (\nhttps://app.collaborativedrug.com/register). The compound representation in CDD Vault can be accessed via the text compound descriptors (as in the\nSupplemental Table 1) or in a batch connection table format as an MDL format structure data file (*.sdf) that is universally read by all chemistry aware software. Being able to easily retrieve the chemical structures in machine retrievable form has considerable value. Identifying compounds by name or company code number does not per se allow direct access to chemical structure and often fails entirely to link compound identifier with the chemistry structure of the compound. InChIKey has the great advantage of being searchable on the web (e.g. via Google) but requires a lookup table (e.g. EMBL\u2019s Unichem) to get back to the chemical structure. SMILES and InChi representations allow direct access to chemical structure and are compatible with structure searching in most public chemistry databases as well as the proprietary chemistry ACS CAS SciFinder database. The IUPAC name is universally used in naming chemical compounds in patents and software exists for going from IUPAC name to chemical structure.",

However they may not be ideal in the opinion of a medicinal chemist. By bringing together all 55 compounds described in the literature with activity against the Ebola virus, this body of evidence may be more convincing than each study in isolation. In addition it allows us to consider structural features and molecular properties, which may provide insights into the target or mechanism of action. It is unclear whether any of the 55 compounds might also have activity when used as combination therapy as is the current standard of care for HIV, in order to overcome drug resistance, and this needs experimental evaluation. Clearly, we are a considerable distance from having an FDA approved drug for the Ebola virus, but this analysis illustrates that there are already drugs on the shelf that can be potentially repurposed in a shorter time period and at a lower cost and yet they do not appear to have been tested in patients with the Ebola virus. In addition there are at least 16 molecules which in the opinion of an experienced medicinal chemist are possibilities for further optimization. While novel compounds are likely more commercially viable they also will require considerable effort to assess safety. Resources will need to be allocated to this effort and administrators and scientists should perhaps consider some of the medicinal chemistry insights we have provided as well as using a collaborative database to share molecules that are active amongst all scientists. It is hoped these efforts could inspire further drug discovery efforts around small molecules.",
