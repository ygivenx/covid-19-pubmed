World Health Organization (WHO) declared that all countries would pay attention to Ebola emergency and provide necessary medical aids to these countries such as Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone [2]. Up to now, the battle against EVD is ongoing and many governments have made emergency plans. Moreover, vaccines against EVD are under test, and it will come into use [3]. Recently, the spokesman of Health Ministry has declared that Ebola would not outbreak in China in large scale, though the imported risk of EVD exists.",

Supported by NSFC, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) has established the platform of computational experiments [4]. Meanwhile, artificial Beijing is generated according to the geodemographics data [5]. Additionally, confirmatory experiments, such as the propagation of H1N1 pandemic influenza, have proved the validation of artificial Beijing [6]. However, it has also exposed some drawbacks. Fixed behavior mode especially restricts the heterogeneity and self-adaption of individuals. For example, contacts always occur among the minority and cannot simulate the actual sense of epidemic. Artificial Beijing is a dynamic system where individuals' behaviors are continually evolving. Therefore, multiagent learning is involved to optimize the behaviors and travelling mode. It endows individuals with the abilities to adapt to the virtual city according to previous knowledge and current situation.",

Simultaneously, domestic scholars have also predicted the outbreak of Ebola in China by analytic method [8]. However, they always neglect the actual interaction conditions among individuals, which always led to the amazingly increased infections and death cases. In our study, the prediction of Ebola emergency is based on artificial Beijing, where social networks, individuals' behaviors, and environment factors are considered at the same time. Subsequently, the occupations of infection cases are summarized, the infection locations are analyzed, and interventions such as isolation and immunization are also discussed. Noncontact infections especially are analyzed in our design. In addition, the infections of medical workers and the corresponding interventions are also discussed. Finally, four levels of emergency responses are simulated, according to the current emergency plans of Chinese government.",

According to the social roles, behavior schedules of individuals are designed. As shown in Table 1, basic schedules of student specify the location, duration, and probability of each activity [12]. p\ni in the table means the action probability in the relevant period.

In the study of Ebola epidemic, it is necessary to expand the corresponding attributes of population and environment. Therefore, typical occupations are designed to simulate the main populations in the virtual city, including medical workers, students, workers, and retirees. Additionally, individual attributes such as age, occupation, and health state are involved. Simultaneously, typical environments such as residential buildings, hospitals, and restaurants are considered. Residential buildings are viewed as the main areas of Ebola propagation because of high contact frequency among families. Hospitals are the places for treatment and isolation, while restaurants provide the places to establish the temporary group with weak links [6], where EVD spreads by noncontact infections. Additionally, the capacity and contact frequency of environment are also considered.",

On the one hand, large scale individual-based simulation brings amazing overhead in computing and communication. Moreover, interventions will also directly bring extra-cost by replanning the schedules of individuals dynamically. On the other hand, it is hard to depict the activities of individuals, which is associated with the reasonability of artificial Beijing. Furthermore, it will affect the interactions among individuals, directly related to the accuracy and reliability of the prediction of Ebola epidemic. Therefore, two ways are outlined to optimize the performance: (1) improving parallel engine by introducing new technologies and algorithms and (2) optimizing the behaviors of individuals and the structure of artificial Beijing. In this section, detailed optimization on individuals' behaviors will be discussed, which not only decreases the computing consume, but also improves the reliability of the virtual city.",

For instance, the DayPattern of a student may consist of breakfast, study, lunch, rest, sport, dinner, entertainment, and sleep. Subsequently, detailed activities are specified according to Daypattern and current situation. Usually, each activity corresponds to a location (l) and duration (\u0394t), stored in the memory (M) of computer. It is priority for an individual to take an activity in the memory and choose the predesigned location. However, an individual needs to replan its activities sometimes. Most of activities will especially be replanned under emergency situation. In addition, an individual just needs to choose another location for activities in case that the current location in the memory is unreachable.",

According to the literature [3], EVD may survive several hours outside the bodies, and one may suffer from the virus according to polluted materials used by patients. Noncontact propagation describes the infections through polluted materials or buildings. For example, an infected individual A has ever stayed in a building and B is probably infected once entering into this building.

Moreover, the modeling work of individuals' behaviors and social networks integrates some positive results of other research teams such as Fudan University. In addition, the reasonability of artificial Beijing has been verified in the case of H1N1 influenza, which is affirmed by NSFC. Secondly, disease model is built according to the propagation parameters in West Africa. Although these parameters may be different from that in Beijing, it has been yet revised by Chinese Academy of Sciences. Moreover, interventions are designed according to the emergency response plans, and the simulation result is coincident with the conclusions of corresponding researches. Thirdly, quantitative analysis also testifies the reasonability of simulation result. As previously discussed, R\n0 is the key parameter in disease propagation. Once R\n0 is bigger than 1, the infection disease will spread; once R\n0 is less than 1, the epidemic situation will be under control. In a word, the goal of interventions is to reduce R\n0 from the current value to below 1. In our experiments, the current R\n0 of 4 levels of response strategies are 1.82, 1.43, 0.93, and 0.48 separately at the 100th day.

Simultaneously, the optimization improves the computing performance, which involves large scale entities. Thirdly, Ebola's propagation process is simulated through the contacts among individuals.

For instance, it is necessary to cultivate the traveling mode of individuals to study personal evacuation under emergency situation. Naturally, the reliability of result mainly depends on the rationality of virtual society and the accuracy of domain models.
