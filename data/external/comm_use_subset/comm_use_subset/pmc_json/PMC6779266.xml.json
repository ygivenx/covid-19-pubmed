However, the higher recovery of viral sequences in\nDNA/RNA samples was considered as misinterpretation by Kaiju program since the later\nfine analyses using BLASTn found that many of the human DNA sequences present in the\nsamples were recognised as DNA viruses due to the similarity of some genomic\nregions. After in silico filtration of the reads by human DNA\nsequences, 77.26% of reads were classified as microbial sequences for June (274,269\nout of 354,975), 81.22% for July (242,730 out of 298,846) and 82.50% for August\n(312,605 out of 378,895). This result showed that the contamination of human DNA was\nproblematic for virus sequence search in these samples. As the human chromosomal and\nmicrobial DNA masked the presence of RNA viruses in the total DNA/RNA samples, the\namount of DNA was reduced by DNase I treatment and the samples were subjected to the\nHTS again as one RNA sample.",

Coronavirus was identified with the\nKaiju program but not by the contig analyses by tBlastx. However, its presence was\nconfirmed by RT-qPCR of PR21 kit. Bocavirus (or Primate bocaparvovirus\n1), and Enterovirus was also identified by PR21\nRT-qPCR, Kaiju and Geneious programs only using Velvet, which is more sensitive\nmethod than SPAdes for contig assembly.
