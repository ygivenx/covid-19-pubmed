            "text": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the leading genetic cause of infant mortality, is characterized by the specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons caused by the mutation in the SMN1 gene (Pearn et al, 1978; Pearn, 1980; Burglen et al, 1995; Lefebvre et al, 1995). Humans are unique in that they have two SMN genes, SMN1 and SMN2 (Lorson et al, 1999; Monani et al, 1999; Rochette et al, 2001). The SMN1 gene generates full-length transcripts (SMN-FL) and functional survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Although the sequence of the SMN2 gene is very similar to that of SMN1, a difference in 5 bp in the SMN2 gene results in disrupted splicing of exon 7, where both SMN-FL transcripts (10%) and transcripts lacking exon 7 (SMN-\u03947) (90%) are generated (Lorson et al, 1999; Monani et al, 1999). In SMA patients, more than 95% of cases have homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene; even if patients have SMN2, the majority of the gene products are SMN-\u03947 which is non-stable and degrades quickly, and thus could not compensate for the loss of SMN1 (Pearn, 1980; Lefebvre et al, 1997). There is an inverse correlation between the number of SMN2 copies and disease severity, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of functional SMN produced by the SMN2 gene (Lefebvre et al, 1997). Therefore, increasing the functional SMN by targeting the alternative SMN2 gene in SMA patients has been a promising therapeutic strategy for SMA (Wirth et al, 2006; Zhou et al, 2012; Singh et al, 2013; Cherry et al, 2014; Howell et al, 2014; d'Ydewalle et al, 2017). Although human SMN2 gene reporters have been generated to screen for candidate drugs, most of these studies used mini-genes that do not have the full expression, splicing, or regulatory elements (Andreassi et al, 2001; Zhang et al, 2001; Lunn et al, 2004; Morse et al, 2012). Building human SMN2 reporters that contain all the elements of the human SMN2 gene would be essential to identify therapeutic agents that can effectively rescue motor neuron degeneration in SMA patients.",

            "text": "SMN protein is a ubiquitously expressed protein; however, reduced levels of this protein results in specific degeneration of spinal motor neurons. It has been shown that the splicing of SMN2 to SMN-FL transcript is much less efficient in spinal motor neurons compared with other type of neurons (Ruggiu et al, 2011). Moreover, the stability of SMN proteins is also affected in SMA. It has been shown that in the presence of low levels of SMN-FL, the oligomerizations of SMN-FL/SMN-FL and SMN-FL/SMN-\u03947 are significantly reduced (Burnett et al, 2009). The reduced levels of SMN have a profound effect on spinal motor neurons, leading to axonal defects and neuronal degeneration. In addition to impaired axonal outgrowth and transport, a recent study reported the dysfunction of mitochondria in mouse NSC-34 cells with SMN knockdown, suggesting that SMN is also important for mitochondrial function (Acsadi et al, 2009). Impaired mitochondrial function (Berger et al, 2003; Ripolone et al, 2015) and increased oxidative stress (Hayashi et al, 2002) have also been reported in SMA patients. We have successfully established human pluripotent stem cell\u2013based models of SMA (Wang et al, 2013b; Xu et al, 2016), which recapitulate disease-specific axonal phenotypes and selective motor neuron degeneration. Interestingly, we also observed mitochondrial defects in SMA spinal motor neurons (Wang et al, 2013b; Xu et al, 2016). These data suggest that axonal defects and mitochondrial dysfunction are important pathological changes in SMA, which serve as unique counter assays to validate candidate compounds.",

Upon the successful establishment of the SMN2-GFP reporter in HEK293 cells, we then screened a small compound library (980 compounds) and identified a novel small molecule that can increase the functional SMN. The compound selected from this small library can significantly increase the expression of SMN protein more than 70% in patient cells, emphasizing the usefulness of this human SMN2-reporter\u2013based strategy for drug screening. To dissect the mechanism of action of this compound, we further examined the effects of this compound on transcription, protein stability, and ubiquitin proteasome and cysteine protease pathway. Finally, to determine the role of candidate compounds on motor neuron degeneration in SMA, we examined the effects of the compound on axonal and mitochondrial defects, as well as motor neuron loss using both SMA induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and SMA mouse models.",

A gRNA that specifically targets the SMN2 gene was designed (Fig 1A). We then verified the targeting efficiency of this gRNA in HEK293 cells (Fig 1B). Using this gRNA together with the donor plasmid and Cas9, we next transfected HEK293 cells through the calcium phosphate precipitation method. As shown in Fig 1C, gRNA/Cas9 induced double-strand break (DSB) and promoted HR-based DNA repair in the presence of the recombination donor. After HR, GFP was specifically integrated into the SMN2 gene to generate the SMN2-GFP reporter (Fig 1C). Please note that GFP with TAA stop codon is specifically integrated and replaced the stop codon within exon 8. During pre-mRNA splicing, open reading frame will include the GFP cassette if exon 7 is excluded. In contrast, the TAA stop codon in exon 7 will make the open reading frame lack GFP if exon 7 is included. If a compound could increase SMN-FL splicing efficiency of SMN2, the GFP signal will decrease. However, if a compound potentiates SMN2 transcription, the GFP signal will increase. Because SMN-\u03947 protein is unstable and degrades quickly, if the SMN protein stability is enhanced by a compound, the GFP signals will also increase. Therefore, the SMN2-GFP reporter we designed is versatile to find candidate drugs, which may regulate SMN2 transcription, splicing, or protein stability.",

The SMN2 reporter cells were treated with these compounds or vehicle for 2 d, and the fluorescence intensities were examined. As expected, protirelin, MG132, and bortezomib significantly increased GFP intensity. In contrast, RG7800, which can down-regulate the proportion of SMN-\u03947 splicing, significantly decreased GFP intensity in SMN2-GFP reporter cells (Fig S1). The Z\u2032-factor for this assay, an evaluation parameter of the quality of assays, is 0.68, suggesting that this reporter system is suitable for drug screening (Zhang et al, 1999). We then examined a small pool library of 980 compounds. SMN2-GFP reporter cells were dissociated and plated onto 96-well plates (10,000 per well). 12 h after plating, each compound was added for 2 d. The fluorescence intensities from each well were then compared between compound-treated and vehicle (DMSO)-treated groups. This resulted in the identification of 14 hits, which brightened GFP fluorescence in the SMN2-GFP reporter line (Fig 2G). Candidate compounds were tested again to validate the repeatability, which showed great repeatability (Fig 2H). Interestingly, there were four candidate compounds belonging to protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis further confirmed that several compounds could significantly increase the protein expression of SMN in patient-derived fibroblasts, among which compound #8 (Z-Phe-Ala fluoromethyl ketone, Z-FA-FMK), an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases (Smith et al, 1988; Van Noorden et al, 1988), was most effective (Fig S2).",

Similarly, as described in the Coriell Web site, these patient fibroblast cells possess the SMN2 gene but do not have the SMN1 gene using TaqMan qRT-PCR assay (Gomez-Curet et al, 2007) (Fig S3). The protein expression levels of SMN in fibroblast cells derived from the SMA patient is much lower than those from the normal individual (WT) (Fig 3E). After treatment with different concentrations of Z-FA-FMK (1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 \u03bcM) for 2 d, the expression levels of SMN proteins were increased by Z-FA-FMK in a dose-dependent manner (Figs 3F and S4). Statistical analysis of biological triplicate samples indicated that Z-FA-FMK can significantly increase the expression of SMN proteins starting from 10 \u03bcM (Fig S4). Similar results were obtained from a second SMA patient\u2019s fibroblast cells (Fig S5), confirming that Z-FA-FMK can restore SMN protein levels in patients\u2019 cells. Notably, Z-FA-FMK could increase the SMN protein expression over onefold, which is comparable with a highly potent agent recently reported (Naryshkin et al, 2014). Similarly, as seen in the reporter cells, Z-FA-FMK did not significantly enhance the mRNA expression of SMN in patient fibroblast cells (Figs 3G and S5C). Together, our data reveal the effectiveness of our SMN2-gene\u2013based screening system and identify a small molecule, Z-FA-FMK, which has a novel role in increasing the protein levels of SMN.",

SMA iPSCs were differentiated into spinal motor neurons used a modified monolayer differentiation system in the presence of retinoic acid (for caudalization) and purmorphamine (for ventralization) (Fig 4A). Similarly, as we previously described (Xu et al, 2016), iPSCs first differentiated into neuroepithelial cells (NE, 1-wk) with characteristic rosette structures (Fig 4A). These neural precursors then differentiated into spinal motor neuron progenitors (2-wk) and subsequent post-mitotic spinal motor neurons (3-wk) (Fig 4A) (Xu et al, 2016). Z-FA-FMK was applied to cultures at 10 \u03bcM starting from the NE stage (day 7). In day-24 spinal motor neuron cultures, the expression of the functional SMN protein was dramatically increased in Z-FA-FMK\u2013treated group compared with that in DMSO-treated SMA spinal motor neurons (Fig 4D). After further culture, SMA spinal motor neurons degenerated; similarly, as we reported before, there was a significant increase in the caspase 3/7 activity, revealing increased apoptosis caused by the deficiency of functional SMN in long-term cultures. Interestingly, after treatment with Z-FA-FMK, the increased caspase 3/7 activity was significantly ameliorated in SMA motor neuron cultures (Fig 4E). Together, these data suggest that the candidate compound, Z-FA-FMK, is effective in increasing the functional SMN and rescuing motor neuron degeneration in human iPSC-based model of SMA.",

To examine the mechanism by which Z-FA-FMK increases SMN levels, we established doxycycline-inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing Myc-SMN2a and Myc-SMN2d to represent different SMN isoforms, SMN-\u03947 and SMN-FL, respectively (Fig 5A). At different time points (2, 4, 8, and 12 h) after doxycycline removal, the expression of Myc-SMN protein was examined and compared between DMSO- and Z-FA-FMK\u2013treated groups. In the DMSO-treated group, both SMN-\u03947 (Myc-SMN2a, Fig 5B and C) and SMN-FL (Myc-SMN2d, Fig 5D and E) proteins were unstable over time, where SMN-\u03947 was noticeably more unstable. Intriguingly, the degradations of both SMN-\u03947 and SMN-FL were significantly inhibited by Z-FA-FMK (Fig 5B\u2013E), revealing that Z-FA-FMK can stabilize both SMN-\u03947 and SMN-FL proteins. It has been shown that MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor, stabilizes the SMN protein through inhibiting the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (Chang et al, 2004). Indeed, MG132 led to dramatic increases in both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins (Fig 5B\u2013E). To dissect the role of Z-FA-FMK, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and examined the ubiquitination of SMN proteins after applying Z-FA-FMK. Our data showed that Z-FA-FMK, unlike MG132, did not cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated SMN proteins (Fig 5F). Together, these data suggest that Z-FA-FMK has a novel role in stabilizing both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins through inhibiting other degradation pathway (e.g., the protease-mediated degradation).",

Using Myc-SMN2a (generating SMN-\u03947 proteins) and Myc-SMN2d (generating SMN-FL proteins)\u2013inducible lines, we compared the formation of SMN gems in Cajal bodies after the withdrawal of doxycycline between DMSO\u2013 and Z-FA-FMK\u2013treated groups (Fig 6A\u2013D). As expected, Z-FA-FMK significantly increased the amount of nuclear SMN gems in Cajal bodies after doxycycline withdrawal in Myc-SMN2d line (Fig 6B and D). Notably, the number of gems also significantly increased in Myc-SMN2a cells after the treatment of Z-FA-FMK (Fig 6A and C).

Notably, two families of cysteine proteases, calpains (CAPN) and cathepsins (CTS), are reported to be associated with the initiation of protein degradations and neurodegeneration (Yamashima, 2004; Siklos et al, 2015). Calpains are Ca2+ ion\u2013activated non-lysosomal cysteine proteases, and cathepsins are lysosomal protease enzymes (Yamashima, 2004; Siklos et al, 2015). Using mRNA sequencing, we first examined the expression of hCalpains and of hCathepsins in 7-wk-old forebrain neurons and spinal motor neurons derived from iPSCs. As shown in Fig 7A, several CAPNs and CTSs, including CAPN1, CAPN2, CAPN7, CTSB, and CTSL are highly expressed (fragments per kilo base per million mapped reads value > 10) in human iPSC-derived motor neurons, implying their role in regulating the degradation of SMN proteins in human motor neurons.",

We found through FACS analysis that knockdown of CAPN1, CAPN7, and CTSL could increase SMN\u03947-GFP intensity (Fig 7B and C). Similar results were observed from two different shRNAs that showed effective knockdown of the gene expression (Figs 7C and S6), excluding the off-target effects. We next overexpressed these proteases and found that CAPN1, CAPN7, and CTSB significantly degraded both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins (Fig 7D and E). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that there was a physical binding between cysteine proteases CAPN1/7 and SMN proteins (Fig 7F). Finally, to investigate the effects of Z-FA-FMK on inhibiting protease-mediated SMN protein degradation, we treated cells that were transfected by combination of proteases (CAPN1+CAPN7, CTSB+CTSL, and CAPN1+CAPN7+CTSB+CTSL) with Z-FA-FMK for 24 h. These combinations were used to achieve optimal inhibition of SMN proteins for better examining the effect of Z-FA-FMK on both non-lysosomal and lysosomal pathways. Western blot analyses showed that the expression of SMN proteins, especially SMN-\u03947, was significantly reduced after the transfection of these proteases; and this reduction was mitigated, at least partially, by the treatment of Z-FA-FMK (Fig S7). Together, these data demonstrate the novel role of both non-lysosomal (CAPN1 and CAPN7) and lysosomal cysteine proteases (CTSB and CTSL) in mediating SMN protein degradation, and Z-FA-FMK can partially mitigate the degradation. Moreover, these proteases can degrade SMN proteins through either direct binding (e.g., calpain 1/7) or other mechanisms, including lysosomal-mediated pathway (e.g., CTSL/CTSB), providing novel targets for therapeutic interventions for SMA.",

Although decreased SMN does not alter the initial specification of motor neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (Wang et al, 2013b; Xu et al, 2016), these neurons degenerate in long-term cultures (Fig 4E). As shown in Fig 9, the proportion of Isl1+ spinal motor neurons significantly decreased in SMA cultures compared with that in the control group (Fig 9A and B). Notably, the treatment of Z-FA-FMK significantly increased the proportion of spinal motor neurons to a level comparable with control neurons. Moreover, in long-term cultures, axonal degeneration as indicated by axonal swelling and breakdown were observed in SMA motor neuron cultures, which was also mitigated by the treatment of Z-FA-FMK (Fig 9C). Thus, our results reveal that Z-FA-FMK effectively rescues the motor neuron loss in long-term culture in human SMA models, suggesting that Z-FA-FMK or compounds targeting similar pathways serve as potent therapeutic candidates for SMA.",

There was no significant difference of body weight between groups (Fig 10D). Z-FA-FMK has not been proven to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB); thus, before molecular structure modification, only a narrow treatment window was used, which may be contributed to its relative limited effects on the life span of SMA mice.",

Because SMA is caused by reduced levels of functional SMN, to increase the functional SMN by targeting the alternative SMN2 gene has been a promising therapeutic strategy for SMA (Wirth et al, 2006; Zhou et al, 2012; Singh et al, 2013; Cherry et al, 2014; Howell et al, 2014). A challenge for this approach is to build robust and effective gene reporters that contain all the elements of the human SMN2 gene. In this study, we successfully established a versatile human SMN2-GFP reporter line in HEK293 cells using CRISPR-Cas9\u2013mediated HR. Because we specifically targeted the SMN2 gene in human cells in situ, an important advantage of this approach is that the SMN2 reporter has all the regulatory elements and thus will be effective in screening for therapeutic agents. As shown in our study, using the SMN2-GFP reporter, the drug screening of a small pool library effectively identified candidate small molecules that can significantly increase the functional SMN, leading to the rescue of motor neuron degeneration in both the iPSC-based model of SMA and the SMN\u03947 mouse model. Our study also demonstrates that SMN proteins can be degraded by both non-lysosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases, and inhibitors of cysteine proteases can increase functional SMN through the stabilization of both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins, providing novel targets and therapeutic approaches for SMA.",

Type I will die before the age of two, whereas type II patients who have more copies of SMN2 could live well into adulthood (Lefebvre et al, 1997). Considering that the functional SMN level in SMA type II patients is \u223c50% higher than that in type I, more than 50% increase of the functional SMN may have dramatic effects on SMA patients. The increase of functional SMN can be achieved through increasing the transcription, switching the splicing, or stabilizing the SMN proteins. By examining the alterations in the GFP fluorescence intensity in our SMN2-GFP reporter lines, compounds increasing SMN will be able to be identified and will be further validated using patient fibroblast cells and motor neurons. The small molecule (Z-FA-FMK) identified from the present study can increase the expression of SMN proteins, not the mRNA, in SMA patient fibroblast cells and iPSCs in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that this compound affects the protein stability. Moreover, Z-FA-FMK increased the expression of functional SMN proteins more than 70% in SMA motor neurons, which is comparable with the most potent SMN2 modifiers (Naryshkin et al, 2014). In addition, cysteine protease inhibitors increase functional SMN through a different mechanism compared with the approved SMA drug (Hache et al, 2016; Bishop et al, 2018), which will allow future combination therapy. Considering the identification of a novel candidate from a small library and the high Z\u2032-factor (>0.5) of the assay, our data suggest the effectiveness of the SMN2-GFP reporter line in identifying potential compounds that can increase functional SMN.",

One possible mechanism underlying this protective effect is that SMN-\u03947 can form a complex with SMN-FL (Le et al, 2005; Burnett et al, 2009), which is more stable and, thus, enhance the SMN-FL proteins. Our study demonstrates that the candidate compound Z-FA-FMK can stabilize both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins, which contributes to its potent effect in increasing functional SMN proteins. Importantly, both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947 proteins have the ability to form gems in Cajal bodies in nuclei, suggesting that these stabilized proteins are functional. Furthermore, unlike MG-132, Z-FA-FMK did not cause the accumulation of ubiquitinated SMN proteins, suggesting that Z-FA-FMK increases the SMN stability through a different mechanism other than ubiquitination/proteasome pathway.",

            "text": "Z-FA-FMK is an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases, and a recent study also showed that SMN may be cleaved by calpain 1, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease (Fuentes et al, 2010). However, it is not known whether other cysteine proteases are involved in the degradation of SMN and whether inhibiting cysteine proteases have beneficial effects in SMA models. Using knockdown and overexpression experiments, we identified critical proteases (CAPN1, CAPN7, CTSB, and CTSL) that mediate the degradation of SMN proteins, which serve as novel therapeutic targets for SMA. Interestingly, we observed differential effects after knocking down and overexpressing cysteine proteases. For example, overexpression of CTSL has no effects, whereas knockdown of CTSL increases SMN levels. This may be because that CTSL is important for the initiation of protein degradation, which awaits further investigation. In the knockdown experiments, although the increase of SMN\u03947-GFP by shRNAs that target individual cysteine protease is only 5\u201320%, the total increase of SMN (both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947) through inhibiting the activity of multiple proteases would be higher. Similarly, overexpressing the combination of cysteine proteases significantly reduces the SMN protein levels, which can be partially restored by Z-FA-FMK and E64d, suggesting that these compounds can stabilize SMN proteins through inhibiting cysteine proteases. Moreover, compounds that increase SMN stability can be combined with drugs targeting other mechanisms (e.g., increasing SMN expression) in the future for combination therapy. During the review of our article, a study revealed that calpain 1 can degrade SMN proteins, and inhibition of calpain is beneficial for SMA (de la Fuente et al, 2018). This study is coinciding with our findings, and more importantly, our data demonstrate that both non-lysosomal (e.g., calpain 1/2) and lysosomal cysteine proteases (e.g., CTSL/CTSB) are involved in degrading SMN proteins. Lysosomal dysfunction is a critical pathological change in neurodegenerative diseases, and, thus these lysosomal cysteine proteases could have important roles in SMA. The detailed alterations of both non-lysosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases, as well as their roles in the pathogenesis of SMA, will be investigated in the future.",

To test the efficacy of candidate compounds, we examined their effects on these phenotypes using both iPSC and animal models. The reduced axonal mitochondrial transport and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, as well as late motor neuron degeneration, can be mitigated by Z-FA-FMK. Notably, application of Z-FA-FMK for only 3 d (PND1 to PND3) was able to increase the life span of SMN\u03947 mice, confirming the efficacy of Z-FA-FMK in vivo. Because Z-FA-FMK could not pass the BBB, this drug was administrated intracerebroventricularly for only 3 d. To increase the time window of drug administration, we tested E64d, a protease inhibitor, which can pass the BBB. Despite the potential pleiotropic effects by inhibiting proteases, E64d has been shown to be safe to patients during clinical trials for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and traumatic brain injury (from Medtrack). Our data reveal that E64d significantly increases functional SMN and mitigates motor neuron degeneration in SMA cell models in vitro. The neuronal activity of these SMA motor neurons could be further examined using electrophysiology analysis in the future. Notably, using SMA mice, we found that injection of E64d significantly elevates SMN protein levels, increases the number of spinal motor neurons, and extends the life span of SMA model mice, confirming its efficacy in vivo. Taken together, our study identifies the novel role of Z-FA-FMK and E64d in rescuing motor neuron degeneration in SMA and highlights a potential therapeutic approach through inhibiting protease-mediated degeneration pathway for the treatment of SMA.",

Likewise, the average optical density of background (no cell fields) was calculated. The ultimate GFP fluorescence intensity of cells was equal to average GFP optical density minus average background optical density. Those compounds that could brighten or darken the GFP fluorescence by more than 0.5-fold compared with that of DMSO-treated cells were regarded as potential hits.

The number of mitochondria was decreased in SMA iPSC\u2013derived neurons compared with WT group; and this decrease was inhibited by the application of Z-FA-FMK. (F) SMA neurons had a nonsignificant trend of decrease in the length of mitochondria as compared with control neurons. (G) The mitochondrial area was significantly decreased in SMA neurons compared with WT. After applying the Z-FA-FMK to SMA neural cultures, the mitochondrial area was significantly increased. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM for WT (n = 10), SMA+DMSO (n = 13), and SMA+Z-FA-FMK (n = 11). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, as compared with the WT group; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, as compared with the SMA+DMSO group by two-tailed t test.",
