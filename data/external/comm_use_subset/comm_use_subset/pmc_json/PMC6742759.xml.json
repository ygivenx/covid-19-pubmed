Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) have traditionally been the major etiological agents of swine enteric diseases, in particular, in Asia. Since 2010, greater economic losses have been made due to the outbreak of emerging and reemerging CoVs, including variant strains of PEDV2, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)3\u20135. Only in year 2013, PEDV outbreak has wiped out more than 10% of America\u2019s pig population5. These CoVs primarily affect suckling piglets and result in high morbidity and up to 100% mortality. They infects the small intestine and can induce watery diarrhea and vomiting, eventually leading to dehydration, body weight loss, and other devastating outcomes. To date, no effective means are available to control these diseases.",

            "text": "Receptor binding and cellular entry are crucial for understanding of the infection processes, host range and tropism of a virus as well as identifying targets for antiviral interventions6. For example, CD163 has been identified as an entry receptor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus and subsequent studies demonstrated that CD163-null pigs are immune to PRRS, which presents a valuable resource for breeding PRRS-resistant pigs7. Aminopeptidase-N (APN) is widely present in the membrane of the epithelial cells of the small intestine in a variety of species, including pigs. In addition, it has been shown to be involved in multiple functions, including peptide metabolism, cell adhesion and cholesterol uptake8. Curiously, APN has also been suggested as a receptor for multiple alphacoronaviruses, including TGEV9, PDCoV10,11, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)12,13. However, these reports relied on the use of cell line or other in vitro models, raising the concern regarding the biological significance of APN\u2019s role in vivo. Meanwhile, whether APN is also required for PEDV infection is unresolved. Previous studies regarding of the role of APN in PEDV susceptibility have yielded conflicting results14\u201319. To resolve unambiguously the functional requirement for porcine APN in TGEV and PEDV infection in vivo, APN-null pigs have to be produced and viral challenge assay performed. Recently, Whitworth et al. have reported APN-null post-weaning pigs are resistant to TGEV but not PEDV20. However, TGEV and PEDV primarily affect suckling piglets with up to 100% mortality and post-weaning pigs have been shown to be less susceptible to these viruses21. We believe it is more biological relevant to determine if APN-null neonatal piglets (<10 days) are resistant to TGEV and PEDV. Meanwhile, only 1 APN-null piglet was used for PEDV challenge experiment in Whitworth et al. study, further consolidating the necessity to clarify the role of APN in PEDV infection again.",

To overcome the limitation, a pool of transfected cells or fibroblast cell lines established from the APN-null pig were used as donors for subsequent SCNT experiments. Results showed a normal early embryogenesis with above 40% of constructed APN-null embryos developing into blastocyst stage after being cultured for 6 days in vitro (Table S1). A total of 1,866 SCNT embryos were transferred into the oviducts of 10 surrogate sows in two days with one week apart. We detected a pregnancy rate of 70% (d50) and all these pregnancies went to term (Table S2). Twenty-one female piglets were born by natural delivery from seven litters with normal SCNT efficiency (1.13%) and the representative piglets are shown in Fig. 1C. Litter size ranged from two to four. Eight piglets failed to thrive within 2 days after birth because of low birth weight, which was associated with the SCNT. All the remaining piglets are healthy prior to viral challenge. Genotyping of small intestines revealed that all the SCNT piglets exhibited bi-allelic modifications at the genomic DNA level (Fig. 1D represents K1-K5 and Table S3 are sequencing results of all cloned piglets used in the present study) and predicted to be translational knockout (KO) (APN\u2212/\u2212). Furthermore, APN KO was confirmed by quantitating protein expression (Fig. 1E) in small intestine in the APN-null piglets. Taken together, these data suggest APN is dispensable for embryogenesis and fetal development in pigs. This conclusion maybe not surprising given that APN-null mice also develop normally without physiological changes23.",

Second, we performed viral challenge experiment in colostrum-deprived neonatal piglets instead of post-weaning piglets used in Whitworth\u2019s study. Since TGEV and PEDV primarily affect suckling piglets with up to 100% mortality and post-weaning pigs have been shown to be less susceptible to these viruses and often survive21, we believe the animal model we used is more biological relevant.
