            "text": "Emotions have long been an important topic of human interactions and society, and have hence been extensively studied in the field of psychological science. Perhaps the first notable scientific endeavor on emotions was Darwin\u2019s (1872/1998). Darwin\u2019s (1872/1998) concept of emotion as expressive and as physiological states has strongly influenced subsequent investigations of emotion. Consequently, emotion researchers have emphasized physiological aspects of emotions, particularly facial expressions (Ekman, 1977, 1999). Ekman\u2019s research suggests that there are universal emotions based on cross-cultural recognition of facial expressions. Although there are cultural differences in display rules for expressing emotion, six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and happiness) have been identified as universal. This tenet is widely accepted among emotion researchers.",

            "text": "In another early attempt to understand emotion, Wundt (1897) proposed that all emotions can be described by three dimensions: pleasurable to non-pleasurable, arousing to subduing, and strained to relaxed. Later, Schlosberg (1954) refined these three dimensions into pleasantness\u2013unpleasantness, attention\u2013rejection, and level of activation. Dimensional models of emotion are based on the assumption that all emotions involve the same interconnected system for emotion states. Still, the currently dominant models are the two-dimensional models: the circumplex model (Russell, 1980; Plutchik and Conte, 1997; Remington et al., 2000), the vector model (Bradley et al., 1992), and the Positive Activation \u2013 Negative Activation (PANA) model which contains two dimensions: positive to negative valence, and high to low activation (Watson and Tellegen, 1985). In most (if not all) of these models, valence is one important dimension, along which a specific emotion is categorized as positive or negative. Indeed, the field of scientific studies on emotion has rested and evolved on the assumption that emotions are either positive or negative.",

People who pursue happiness strongly tend to be more depressed, miserable, and unhappy.",

Further, Tamir and Bigman (2014) demonstrate that there are benefits (cognitive upsides; e.g., anger resulted in better performance on a confrontational task) to experiencing emotions that typically elicit unpleasant feelings (affective downsides). This suggests that so-called positive emotions can have a negative influence on people, and that negative emotions can have a positive influence.",

Simultaneous emotions have also been reported in response to winning in disappointing fashion (e.g., a victory that could have been better) and losing in a relieving fashion (e.g., a defeat that could have been worse; Larsen et al., 2004). Thus, despite the traditional emotion framework that conceptualizes emotions dichotomously \u2013 as being either positive or negative, the literature suggests that a more flexible approach is needed. This might be why emotion researchers have long argued that the same emotion can serve different functions (Ekman, 1984; Scherer, 1984; Frijda and Mesquita, 1994). Indeed, researchers have found both positive and negative effects of a positive mood, and of a negative mood (Clore et al., 1994).",

Individualistic cultures believe that self-reflective emotions (emotions that reflect on the individual\u2019s own actions) concerning a person doing well are good, whereas collectivistic cultures believe that self-reflective emotions concerning that one\u2019s actions need improvement are desirable. For example, those from individualistic cultures tend to consider pride as a desirable emotion, and those from collectivist cultures tend to consider guilt a desirable emotion (Eid and Diener, 2001). This is in line with cultural differences in regulatory focus. Overall, Eid and Diener\u2019s (2001) results further support that not all positive emotions are interpreted positively by all people, nor are all negative emotions interpreted negatively. Indeed, Tsai et al. (2006) and Tsai (2007) have shown that ideal affect \u2013 the affective state that people desire feeling \u2013 varies across cultures: Americans value high-arousal positive affective states (such as excitement) more, whereas East Asians value low-arousal positive affective states (such as calm or peacefulness) more. Further insight to these differences can be found in the literature concerning the components of emotion.",

The affective component is related to our immediate response to stimuli (feelings), while the cognitive component is our more controlled, conscious evaluation after the immediate response (thinking). The Component Process Model (CPM), which is based on appraisal theory, suggests that emotion is composed of different stages: automatic sensory motor, schematic unconscious, and controlled conscious stages (Scherer, 1982, 1984; Van Reekum and Scherer, 1997). According to the CPM, the affective process is more immediate and provides a strong subjective sense of feeling that is prominent to oneself. The affective process is automatic, less controlled, and tends to be strongly aligned with the valence of the emotion); on the other hand, the cognitive process is rather controlled, occurring later in the realization of emotion sequence. The cognitive components of emotions are therefore considered less intense and less extreme compared to the affective components (Scherer, 1982, 1984; Tice et al., 2004; Ochsner and Gross, 2005). Indeed, research has shown that affective and cognitive components of emotions do not necessarily corroborate each other. For example, Tamir and Bigman (2014) explain that emotions can be pursued both for how they feel and what they accomplish, and highlight the complexities among the different emotional motives. For example, a boxer may desire to feel anger, a negative emotion, in order to motivate himself to beat his opponent. So although he may be feeling a negative emotion (affective component), he thinks about it in a positive light (cognitive component).",

            "text": "This distinction is similar to Mayer and Gaschke\u2019s (1988) model, which argues that moods have at least two components: The direct experience of a mood, and a meta level of experience that consists of thoughts and feelings about the mood (Mayer and Gaschke, 1988). They are called meta-moods because they do not concern the immediate experience of feeling states, but concern their reflective experience, involving subjective thoughts and feelings about one\u2019s moods. The regulatory process of the reflective experience is under the individual\u2019s control. The duality described above may explain why some cultures focus on hedonic pleasures (e.g., Western cultures) while others focus on peace and harmony (e.g., Eastern cultures). Indeed, East Asians reported that happiness is experienced as rather calm and zen-like, whereas Westerners reported that happiness is experienced as excitement and extreme positivity (Tsai, 2007). This may explain why Westerners desire to feel positive emotions more than negative emotions relative to Easterners (Sims et al., 2015). All of the above suggests that subjective interpretation of specific emotions (i.e., primarily the cognitive component of emotion) differs across cultures (Uchida et al., 2004). Most recently, an argument based on Higher Order Theory (HOT) was put forth that emotions are cognitive (LeDoux and Brown, 2017). Based on the literature review on neuroimaging evidence, they have concluded that emotion is a cognitive process, as it involves cortical (conscious) rather than subcortical (unconscious) brain circuits. This suggests that emotion could be a higher order process, separate from the affect we feel.",

            "text": "Emotions and cognitions are intertwined. Indeed, emotions are the result of human cognition (Lazarus, 1982), and cognitive processes in turn are influenced by emotion (Forgas, 1995). Research has shown that culture influences cognitive processes (Nisbett et al., 2001). Ji et al. (2001) found that Westerners tend to have a linear thinking style, resulting in expectations of unchanging or consistent outcomes. Easterners, by contrast, have a more dialectical thinking style, resulting in expectations of more malleable or changing outcomes (see also Peng and Nisbett, 1997). East Asians\u2019 greater dialectical thinking, or the degree to which contradictions are tolerated, is thought to drive the more predominant emotional complexity (i.e., concurrence of positive and negative emotion) of East-Asians relative to Westerners (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2010). Because dialectical thinking involves a greater expectation of change, it is likely that any thought about emotion will be less extreme. This is because if something is expected to change or fluctuate, it would not be taken in the extreme view. Linear thinkers, on the other hand, expect stability, so their thoughts might be grounded more in the extremes (less likely to change because they are so strong). One difference between dialectical and linear thinking styles lies in how people from different cultures view events. Easterners tend to take a more balanced view of negative events compared to Westerners (Ji et al., 2004). Indeed, findings suggest that people from dialectical and collectivist cultures (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Indonesians, and Malaysians) make less polarized life quality judgments, whether negative or positive, compared to non-dialectical thinkers and individualist cultures (e.g., Americans; Minkov, 2009).",

Miyamoto and Ma (2011), in a series of studies, showed that, although people in general want to savor rather than dampen their positive emotions, such hedonic emotion regulation was weaker among Asians than among Americans. Furthermore, dialectical beliefs about positive emotions mediated such cultural differences. As a whole, these findings indicate that culturally specific dialectical beliefs guide both emotion regulation and emotional experience. In fact, people from interdependent cultures tend to report experiencing positive and negative emotions simultaneously (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2010).

Cross-culturally, Miyamoto et al.

Second, based on research that the affective component of emotion is more intense and extreme than the cognitive component, we hypothesized that the positivity and negativity ratings would be more divergent for affective than for cognitive components. For example, sadness, which is salient in negativity, should be rated more negatively on the affective than the cognitive component, and relatively less positively on the affective than cognitive component (H2). Finally, based on the review of the culture and emotion literature, we hypothesized that American and Canadian ratings would be higher for the salient valence (e.g., negativity for sadness) and lower for the less salient valence (e.g., positivity for sadness) of an emotion, compared to Chinese and Koreans (H3).",

Thus, H1, that each emotion contained some degree of positivity and negativity is supported (Figure 1).

Additionally, we performed a 6 (emotion) \u00d7 2 (valence) \u00d7 4 (country) mixed ANOVA with emotional ratings averaged across affective and cognitive components as the dependent variable.
