Studies in the 1980s highlighted the importance of viruses in LRTI and identified RSV as the predominant cause in children aged <5 years also in developing countries [6]. This was confirmed in a WHO-sponsored denominator-based study of RSV-associated LRTI in four developing countries [7]. Moreover, while influenza virus is being recognized as causing severe LRTI in otherwise healthy children in high-income countries [8], little information on its epidemiology is available from resource-poor settings. A few studies on the more recently discovered hMPV have been published, but these studies were small and covered varying seasons and age groups [9-11]. Seasonality of RSV and influenza in tropical and sub-tropical regions differs from the well-defined seasonal outbreaks seen in temperate climates, and the seasonal pattern of these infections in developing countries varies considerably between regions [1,12]. Knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infections is essential for predicting epidemics and planning preventive measures, such as development and introduction of vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.",

The lower of the two counts was used in the analyses. Children were weighed using a UNICEF electronic scale (SECA, Hamburg, Germany) accurate to 100 g with a mother/child-function, so the weight of the child could be determined while held by his or her mother. The child's length/height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wooden measuring board (as recumbent length in children <2 years of age and as height in children \u2265 2 years of age). Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured either on a finger or a toe with a pulse oxymeter (Siemens MicO2, Siemens Medical Systems Inc, Danvers, MA, USA) using a pediatric sensor (Nellcor, Pleasanton, CA, USA). It was recorded twice 1 min apart after stabilization of the sensor for 1 min. The higher of the two measurements was used in the analyses. The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) was determined from a capillary or venous blood specimen using a semi-quantitative rapid test (QuikRead\u00ae CRP, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) and a portable photometer (QuikRead\u00ae 101, Orion Diagnostica) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The test had a measurement range of 8 to 160 mg/L and values outside the measurement range were indicated as <8 or >160 mg/L. NPA specimens were obtained using a sterile, disposable suction catheter (Pennine Healthcare Ltd, Derbyshire, UK) with a suction trap (trachea suction set, Unomedical a/s, Birker\u00f8d, Denmark) connected to a foot pump (Ambu\u00ae Uni-Suction Pump, Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark).

Suction was applied for a minimum of 10 sec with maximum negative pressure of 200 mmHg.

In brief, nucleic acids were extracted from 360 \u03bcl of NPA (or plasmid RNA from positive control transcripts) using a nucleic acids extraction kit (Roche High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit, F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each run of the assay included a positive RNA control and a negative control (virus transport medium), starting at nucleic acid isolation. Specimens and negative controls were individually spiked with 40 \u03bcl of internal control during nucleic acid isolation to identify any inhibitors. cDNA was produced by reverse transcription using random hexamers, murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (ABI, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), RNase inhibitor (ABI) and 3 \u03bcl of extracted viral RNA. Amplification reactions were performed using GeneAmp\u00ae PCR System 2700 (ABI). Ten \u03bcl of newly synthesized cDNA was added to a mix consisting of 2.5 U of AmpliTaq\u00ae Gold DNA polymerase (ABI) and a Super-Mix containing seven pairs of forward and backward primers flanking unique sequences of the seven viruses (the hemagglutinin neuraminidase gene of PIV types 1, 2 and 3, the matrix protein gene of InfA, the NS1 and NS2 genes of InfB, the NS1 and NS2 genes of RSV and the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV). After initially holding the PCR mixture at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, amplification was performed as follows: two cycles at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec, and then 38 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by an additional 7 min at 72\u00b0C and immediate cooling to 4\u00b0C. After amplification, the PCR products were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) and analyzed by enzyme hybridization assay [15], measuring the optical density at 450 nm (OD450) using a micro-plate reader (Stat Fax\u00ae 2100, Awareness Technology Inc, Palm City, FL, USA).",

Anthropometric measures were expressed as Z-scores, which were generated using the WHO Child Growth Standards 2005 [23]. Meteorological data for the Kathmandu airport weather station (located approximately 10 km from Bhaktapur) were obtained from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, Kathmandu, Nepal. Mean daily values for relative humidity and temperature were calculated as the average of two daily measurements (relative humidity at 8.45 AM and 5.45 PM, and maximum and minimum temperature).

It should be noted that many of these studies also included measles. A recently published denominator-based study from a birth cohort comprising 635 Kenyan children followed through three RSV epidemics reported that 13% of cases with LRTI were attributable to RSV infection, which was diagnosed using IF [31].

After RSV, InfA and PIV3 were the most common viruses in our study, as reported elsewhere [1,3,28]. We detected hMPV in 4.2% of pneumonia cases.

Studies in the Indian subcontinent have reported RSV infections to peak both in the cold season [27] and in the rainy season [35,36], as well as being detectable throughout the year [35,37]. We observed RSV epidemics both in winter and during the monsoon. The virus was isolated during a period of 6 to 7 months and the epidemic peaks were observed with intervals of 15 and 9 months, which is consistent with patterns described elsewhere [31,38].",

However, the underlying reasons for the observed seasonal patterns demonstrated by these individual respiratory viruses are unclear. Climate could have a direct impact on virus survival, transmission efficiency, and host immunity, or have an indirect effect through climate-dependent behavior change, such as indoor crowding and eating habits [55]. It is likely that several factors interact in complex ways in the development of observed epidemics under favorable climatic conditions and that the contribution of individual factors varies for the different viruses.",

The frequency of viral co-detections varies widely and depends on the number of diagnostic methods applied [59] and the number of pathogens tested for [58]. By employing multiplex PCR assays for 11 viruses, a study in 515 Korean children aged \u2264 5 years detected viruses in 312 (60.6%) of cases and a viral co-detection in 36 (11.5%) [45]. In addition to the seven viruses identified in our study, the Korean study also detected adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus; and, notably, the last virus was identified in 22 of the 36 co-detections. The clinical role of bocavirus in pneumonia in otherwise healthy children is unclear [60,61], as is the importance of multiple viral infections [57,59]. Quantitative PCR methods to determine viral load in clinical specimens could provide valuable information on the pathogenetic role of each virus in such co-detections [61], as could case-control studies.",

Viral load in a specimen depends on several conditions, such as time of collection in relation to onset of illness. In most of the study children, the NPA specimen was collected early in the course of illness, which increases the likelihood of detecting an infectious agent [14]. Moreover, by not including children who had taken antibiotics during the last 48 hours, we primarily recruited new cases of pneumonia. Using multiplex instead of single molecular assays may have contributed to an underestimation of the number of viral CAP cases, as some loss of sensitivity is an inherent limitation of multiplex PCR assays [13].",

A limitation of our study was that we were not able to include more etiologic agents in our diagnostic panel. Adenovirus is among the more common viral respiratory pathogens causing LRTI in preschool children [64]. Atypical bacteria, like Mycoplasma pneumoniae, cause pneumonia more frequently in school-age children, but can also cause mild infections in younger children [65]. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are the main bacterial pathogens causing childhood pneumonia. However, nasopharyngeal carriage of these bacteria is frequent in healthy, young children [66]. Moreover, their detection in pneumonia is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining specimens from the lower airways and the low sensitivity of identifying these pathogens by blood culture [67], and such invasive methods are not well suited for community settings. S. pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of virus-associated pneumonia in children in hospital, especially in cases with influenza and PIV types 1 to 3 [68]. The monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the CAP epidemic that peaked in December 2005 (Figure 2), which comprised the largest outbreaks of influenza A and B (Figure 3). There is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for pneumococcal disease [69]. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the cases where we detected a viral pathogen in fact had a mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia or pneumonia after acquisition of a new pneumococcal serotype during an upper respiratory viral infection. Again, quantitative PCR methods and carefully conducted case-control studies could shed light on the clinical importance of detecting viral pathogens in NPA specimens from children with pneumonia.",
