We applied the selected 3\u2032-SL derivative to in vivo experiments in pathogen free chickens as model animals for the prevention and treatment of potential pandemic bird flu influenza virus (H9N2) infection, one of the viruses tested. Influenza viruses, particularly influenza A, are the causative agents of seasonal epidemics, causing serious public health problems with 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year worldwide10. Likewise, AI viruses, unlikely to infect humans except few strains such as H5N1 and H7N9, infect birds including poultry, and create severe economic burdens on local and global economic and international trade10. H9N2 is one of the highly prevalent AI virus subtypes with wide distribution around the world, since its first detection in Wisconsin in 196611. H9N2 is not only infectious to birds, but has also recently been found to be transmissible to humans12, and other animals, such as pigs13. In poultry, it causes acute respiratory tract infections, resulting in a drop in egg production, and increased mortality in the field when co-infected with other pathogens14,15. The unprecedented rate of spread of H9N2 among egg-laying hens and other poultry in South Korea raised poultry and poultry products\u2019 prices sharply higher. According to the recent news from ministry of agriculture, food and rural affairs, S. Korea culled nearly 38 million farm birds within November 2016 to June 2017, more than a fifth of its total poultry population. More recently, the country is facing severe outbreak of another highly pathogenic AI H5N8 strain, raising country\u2019s bird flu alert to its highest level \u2018grave level\u2019 while banning the transportation of poultry and bird farmers nationwide.",

Prevention of pathogen attachment to the host cell or detachment of adherent pathogen blocks the infectious agent from interaction with the host cell, and subsequent internalization and delivery of virulence factors, and access to the nutrients and evasion of the host immune system. This leads to simple elimination of pathogens from the host by a cleansing mechanism16. Bacterial adhesins or lectins are proteins or polysaccharides that are at the surface of the cells, and bind specifically to certain sugar moieties present in the host cell surface17,18. Influenza viruses also utilize saccharides binding protein such as haemagglutinin (HA) for adhesion to the host cell. AI virus HA preferably binds to 3\u2032-SL molecules prior to internalization in host cells. Thus, neutralization of HA in AI viruses by 3\u2032-SL could eliminate viruses from birds by a cleansing mechanism, preventing their entry into the body.",

Most microbial and animal interactions involve carbohydrate-containing receptors. Therefore, molecules mimicking these carbohydrate receptors are the main basis of anti-adhesion therapy19. In this study, we selected two SHMOs 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL as anti-adhesive molecules against several AI viruses in in vitro experiment.

The concept of HI assay using various concentrations of 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL studies the effectiveness of the prevention of binding of viruses to the chicken red blood cells (cRBCs) by SL derivatives. Sialic acid moiety of 3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL binds to the hemagglutinin present in viruses. As a result, viruses are neutralized, hence preventing hemagglutinin mediated binding of viruses with sialic acids present in the surface of cRBCs. We determine the highest diluted concentration of SL-derivatives that prevents hemagglutination of cRBCs to be the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Fig. 2). 3\u2032-SL showed promising results with all thirteen viral strains tested in this assay. Except H1N1 subtypes of viruses and one H1N2 subtype virus (A/Swine/Korea/PZ4/2006), MIC of 3\u2032-SL was less than 16 mM with all the other viruses tested. In particular, the molecule showed the lowest MIC value of 5.0 mM with the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain of H5N1 subtype A/Chicken/IS/2006. Similarly, the MIC of another HPAI virus of H5N8 strain (A/Duck/Korea/Gochang1/2014) and one of the H3N2 subtype strains A/Swine/Korea/CAN04/2005 was 12.5 mM for 3\u2032-SL. However, the MIC of H1N1 subtype viruses including (A/Swine/Korea/CAS08/2005, A/Swine/Korea/DDC-251-1/2008, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, and A/Korea/01/2009 (Pandemic)) was 100 mM or higher (125 mM). Similarly, one of the H1N2 subtypes of viruses, A/Swine/Korea/PZ4/2006 also had a higher MIC value with 3\u2032-SL. Other AI viruses H1N2 (A/Swine/Korea/274-3), H3N2 (A/Swine/Korea/GC0407/2005, A/Swine/Korea/CY10/2007), and H9N2 (A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/1996) had similar MIC values (15.62 mM) with 3\u2032-SL (Fig. 2).",

It demonstrates clinical signs of depression, edema of head, cyanosis of comb and legs, and drop in egg production; and has a mortality rate of (5\u201330)%20. During the first outbreak of H9N2 in 1996, vaccination against AI viruses was not allowed. Later, its use was permitted in 2007, which efficiently prevented the spread of H9N221. However, it was reported that Korean H9N2 subtype AI virus underwent antigenic drift by mutation at the antigenic sites, and could escape vaccine protection because of the excessive use of animal vaccination22,23. The consequence of antigenic drift could be new outbreaks of H9N2 in the near future. Thus, several vaccination strategies to animals are in practice to confront future outbreaks of H9N2 in Korea, and approaches are further advanced because of abundant genetic information on AI viruses. But vaccination against AI viruses has several issues related to the international trade of poultry and poultry products, and AI virus surveillance programs23. Thus, the search continues for a safe and effective alternative approach to control such infections and outbreaks, because in many cases, pre-existing vaccines and antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of infections are not appropriate.",

Meanwhile, several studies have established the significance of SHMOs such as sialyllactose as a health beneficiary to humans, particularly infants, to gain resistance to microbial infections by neutralizing them, and preventing invasion29,30. Extensive studies have been carried out on sialyllactoses (3\u2032-SL and 6\u2032-SL) that compete with binding sites, and prevent the adhesion of pathogens such as Salmonella31,32, Escherichia coli31\u201334, Helicobacter pylori32, Vibrio cholera31, Compylobacter jejuni32 and rotaviruses35. Bacteria have been found to contain more than one adhesion protein in their surface. Moreover, other various factors also determine their adhesion to the receptors on the host cell surface, such as hydrophobic interactions, and non-specific interactions. Hence, preventing bacterial population from adhesion by a single anti-adhesion molecule is challenging and ineffective. Hence, multiple agents targeting each adhesion protein are necessary to effectively control pathogens by using anti-adhesion therapy36,37.",

The major drawback of the use of such sugar analogs is the requirement in higher dose to achieve bacterial adhesion inhibition, because of their low affinity with the target protein. In some instances, the problem has been addressed by linking with hydrophobic residues, which significantly increases the affinity of carbohydrate molecules with target proteins, lowering the concentration of analogs required for anti-adhesion40\u201342.

The efficacy of virus neutralization was different with different molecules in in vitro HI assay (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the MIC values were also different for the strains of the same HA subtype viruses. For example, among five H1N1 subtype strains, 3\u2032-SL neutralized A/Swine/Iowa/15/30 efficiently (MIC = 31.25 mM) than other four strains for which MIC values were 100 mM or above. Likewise, among two strains of H1N2 subtype viruses, the MIC value for A/Swine/Korea/PZ4/2006 was higher (62.5 mM) than A/Swine/Korea/274-3 for which the value was 15.62 mM. The MIC values of three strains of H3N2 subtype viruses was also different. The similar pattern was observed in the case of 6\u2032-SL with the same sets of viruses (Fig. 2). The possible reason for different antiviral efficacy by the same molecule against the same HA subtype virus strains could be because of the different receptor specificities of the HA of viruses46. Several previous studies established key role of HA present on viruses that account in part to determine avidity of receptor binding24,26,46. Thus, simple sequence analysis and homology modeling of HA does not always provide enough evidences to draw conclusions on receptor specificity of HA of strains belonging to the same HA subtype.",

Since influenza virus uses haemagglutinin protein, a single receptor binding site for adhesion to host cells, it could be easy to neutralize and prevent infecting viruses from binding and invading host cell epithelia by generating competition on the binding site by feeding receptor analogs, as Fig. 6 depicts. The mechanism of preventing pathogens for adhesion to host cell receptors and invasion of host cell during infection cycle; and finally eliminating them out of the body by simple wash out is well established as cleansing mechanism (Fig. 6). This mechanism is also naturally present in animal\u2019s immune defense system. 3\u2032-SL mimicked as host cell receptors of epithelial cell to H9N2 virus which preferentially bind to \u03b12,3-linked sialyl glycans present in avian mucus cells. Thus, 3\u2032-SL effectively neutralized H9N2 virus by binding at its receptor binding sites and apparently removing them from colon by simple wash out (Figs 4 and 6). Interestingly, when 0.8 HAU of viruses were used to challenge the chickens and treated with 3\u2032-SL every day, the virus load was nil within 24 hours. There were no observable clinical signs, symptoms, or side effects in all chickens receiving 3\u2032-SL. ELISA assay of the sera of the chickens also confirmed the complete prevention of virus entry into the blood stream, since we detected no antibody against H9N2 virus. Viruses used for infection were completely neutralized by 3\u2032-SL and excreted out of the body within 24 hours, as we detected no virus in the oral and cloacal swab samples (Fig. 4). Thus, this molecule could be a promising compound for the prevention of H9N2 virus infection in chickens. Although anti-adhesion therapy needs a higher dose of non-toxic molecules, multimers of 3\u2032-SL containing molecules will certainly address this problem, and lower the use of 3\u2032-SL concentration to prevent virus adhesion. On the other hand, 3\u2032-SL is a non-toxic molecule that is naturally present in human milk. It also did not exhibit toxic effect at 200 mM in MDCK cells in in vitro experiment (Table 2). Thus, there is no doubt on the toxicity issue of this molecule, which is completely safe to humans and other animals.",
