Both influenza and RSV display distinct seasonality, however, the exact timing and magnitude of their annual epidemics remain difficult to predict [2]. A better understanding of the epidemiology of these pathogens is useful for the prevention and control of future epidemics and for optimising clinical management of patients [3]. Moreover, this knowledge may inform prediction models used to estimate the timing and magnitude of influenza epidemics [2].",

During peaks of influenza epidemics, the spread of other respiratory viruses, particularly RSV, appears to be limited [4\u20136]. Delays in outbreaks of influenza during the 2009 pandemic in Europe were linked to the annual rhinovirus epidemic associated with the beginning of the school year [7\u20139]. In turn, the influenza pandemic was observed to interfere with seasonal epidemics of RSV in France [10] and Israel [11], RSV and metapneumovirus in Germany [12], seasonal influenza in Hong Kong [13] and all respiratory viruses except rhinovirus in Beijing [14]. Studies investigating viral interference since the pandemic are sparser, though two studies reported that the timing and magnitude of respiratory virus epidemics were affected by the timing of the seasonal influenza A peak [15, 16]. Collectively, these observations suggest interference may prevent respiratory viruses reaching their epidemic peaks concurrently, but also underscore the complexity of these interactions.",

Once a viral infection is established, interferon production is believed to confer temporary immunity to neighbouring cells against infection by other respiratory viruses [17]. In vitro, infection with RSV is blocked by competitive infection of influenza A if the host is not infected with the two viruses simultaneously [18]. Similarly, ferret models have shown that influenza A infection may prevent successive infection with RSV [19] and that coinfection with different influenza subtypes is dependent upon the order in which the viruses infect the host [20].",

Negative associations have also been observed between the detection of influenza A, RSV, parainfluenza virus or coronavirus and co-detection of other respiratory viruses [8, 23, 24], providing further evidence for a refractory period after initial infection during which the host is less likely to be infected by subsequent exposure to another respiratory virus.",

Time series analyses indicated the annual occurrence of epidemics for influenza A and RSV and less recurrent epidemics for influenza B, coronavirus and parainfluenza virus. Picornavirus was observed to be endemic throughout the period of analysis. RSV epidemics generally began in autumn and peaked early winter, while influenza A began mid-winter and peaked late winter. The higher incidence of RSV observed pre-2009 may be a result of the higher proportion of children under 5 years in our sample pre-2009, as RSV is considered the most important respiratory illness-causing pathogen in infants [27]. We observed summer peaks of influenza A in some years which was somewhat unexpected in a temperate climate but was only reflected in state-wide notification data after 2009. It is possible that inter-epidemic peaks we observed are a result of denominator data, while the increase in notifications resulted from a rise in testing after the 2009 pandemic [28]. In years that epidemics occurred, influenza B, coronavirus and parainfluenza virus peaked in winter and metapneumovirus in spring.",

Influenza A subtype did not affect cross-correlations: in seasons where significant correlation was observed, the lag calculated for influenza A overall was similar to that of the predominant subtype. In some seasons, influenza A(H1N1) appeared to circulate prior to RSV. However, in these seasons the number of A(H1N1) positive samples was <10, so the results should be interpreted with caution. An investigation into seasonal relationships between epidemic curves of other viruses was limited by the small proportion of positive tests. The endemic nature of picornavirus appeared to be unaffected by the circulation of other respiratory viruses, which supports previous observations of rhinovirus activity (most common species of picornavirus) [15, 16]. This may be a result of increased stability of the non-enveloped picornavirus during warmer months compared to other viruses, like influenza, which are restricted by temperature and humidity [29].",

Improved availability and sensitivity of diagnostic tests has resulted in more regular detection of co-infections [30], though the impact of viral co-infection on clinical severity remains unclear [31, 32]. A prospective household transmission study during the 2009 influenza pandemic reported that the infection wave caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was interrupted by a wave of non-influenza respiratory virus infections [33]. It found individuals infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were less likely to be infected by non-influenza respiratory viruses than non-infected individuals (RR: 0.32). Further, there was a significant decrease in the duration of viral shedding in co-infections (of any respiratory viruses) compared to single infections. These observations suggest that such interactions may modulate influenza attack rate during outbreaks, thus shaping the epidemic and highlighting the importance of better understanding co-infections in the context of viral interference.",

Moreover, it is believed to be the driver of epidemiological interaction between respiratory viruses at the population level, which is visible when two viruses may not reach their epidemic peak during the same period. While rhinovirus has been the focus of other studies investigating co-detection, we found that influenza A, RSV and picornavirus all had significant negative associations with co-detection of other viruses. Results of further investigation by logistic regression adjusted for covariates that are predictors of codetection (sex, age and season) were compatible with influenza A, RSV and picornavirus conferring temporary immunity against infection by another respiratory virus. However, we cannot make causal inferences from the design used and therefore, cannot eliminate the role of other environmental factors.",

All inferences we made and indeed the majority of inferences made in other studies investigating respiratory virus interference are based on ecological data. With such data, we cannot determine whether events observed are the result of a biological mechanism, nor can we infer the direction of the postulated interaction, i.e. which virus impacts which. To make any form of causal inference, a prospective study that serially samples participants over multiple respiratory virus epidemics would be required. Furthermore, we did not adjust for other potential drivers of viral interference, such as environmental (e.g. temperature, humidity), social and behavioural factors. Also, we cannot rule out the possibility that our observations were the result of surveillance artefacts, that is, changes in testing patterns that are not a result of genuine fluctuations in viral circulation. While we excluded specimens isolated from outbreaks or for surveillance and samples from 2009 and 2016\u20132017 when testing patterns were obviously altered, we cannot be certain we controlled completely for this unknown. Type/subtype data for other viruses may have also improved the resolution of our findings, as other studies have noted variances in the timing of epidemics caused by different types of parainfluenza virus [4, 6] and rhinovirus [21] and there is scant information available for RSV. Additionally, our study sample was drawn from patients ill enough to seek healthcare. As some viruses (such as picornavirus) are more likely to result in asymptomatic infection than others, the distribution of viruses in our sample may differ from that in the population. Finally, the referral base of paediatric samples for VIDRL is limited as most Victorian paediatric samples are forwarded to a children's hospital. Given there is a high burden of respiratory virus infection in children, this may have limited our analyses.",
