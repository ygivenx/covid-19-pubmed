FECV is very common in the cat population worldwide, and has been shown to have infected 20-60% pet cats and shed by 75-100% cats in multi-cat environments\n[1,2]. Of those shedding the virus, 1-5% will develop Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) disease\n[3]. Within the biotypes, the viruses are differentiated further into serotype I and serotype II, based on virus neutralizing antibodies. Type I FECV and FIPV strains are more ubiquitous worldwide and are more likely to cause clinical FIP, while type II strains are less common, but more adaptable to cell culture\n[2].",

Studies have shown that several mutations throughout the FIPV genome were detected, but mutations at 3c membrane protein and 7b secretory glycoprotein genes were suggested to be responsible for transforming FECV to FIPV\n[4,5]. A recent study revealed that mutation of the S1/S2 locus and modulation of a furin recognition site normally present in the S gene of FECVs is a critical contributing factor for development of FIP\n[6]. Furthermore, it was found that FIPV infection is associated with T cell depletion by apoptosis; although the virus cannot infect CD4+ and CD8+ T cells\n[7,8]. Therefore, apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is probably caused by mediators from infected macrophages and/or intestinal epithelial cells\n[8,9]. Hence, little is known about the interaction of the virus and host cells; especially the early cellular transcriptional responses towards virus infection, virus mechanism of inducing T cell apoptosis, and the absence of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) response in FIP infected cats.",

The expressions of A3H, which involved in viral RNA and DNA editing causing mutation during RNA virus infection\n[17] and PD-1 and its ligand (PD-L1), which are involved in programmed cell death and negative regulation of T cells immune response\n[18], were characterised. A3H has antiretroviral activity by generating lethal hypermutations in viral genomes and is associated with increased resistance to HIV-1 infection in certain populations\n[19]. In the case of felines, A3H (but not A3C) has been found to reduce the infectivity of feline leukemia virus\n[17]. It is interesting to detect that the expression of A3H is readily expressed at higher levels in PBMCs than in FIPV infected cells (Tables \n3 and\n5), indicating the possible involvement of the gene in antiviral activity. Furthermore, the up-regulation of the gene is less, compared to PD-1 and PD-L1 in FIPV diagnosed cats. In addition, the expressions of A3H are significantly up-regulated in FIPV infected CRFK cells at 48 h.p.i. The actual reason for this high expression of A3H is unclear, but suggests that this gene is essential in restricting viral replication or forming part of the type 1 interferon-induced innate response, since recent study has indicated the involvement of A3H in restricting virus replication\n[17,20].",

Even though the study was performed on infected CRFK cells, a kidney epithelial cells, it is interesting to note that transcriptome analysis of cells proposed that the inflammation process was associated with proinflammatory and Th1-like cytokines production, due to the up-regulation of several chemokine genes, such as CCL8, CXCL10, and CCL17; and genes associated with innate immune responses, such as PHF11, ATF3, and IRF1. Further study on infection of FIPV in particularly type I FIPV on macrophage-like cells namely fcwf-4 cells and samples from FIP diagnosed cats will add more value to our findings. Furthermore, the down-regulation of CRIP1 (a T helper regulatory gene) (Table \n2) also suggests that FIPV infection is associated with Th1 response, based on a study on CRIP1 gene in mice, transgenic mice, and in murine cell line\n[25]. In that study, they found that the down-regulation of CRIP was associated with the expression of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. Previous studies have shown that in vitro and in vivo FIPV infections were associated with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 expressions\n[9,26].",

In our study, we found that at 3 hours, a few complete virus genomes that completely aligned to FIPV 79\u20131146 reference genome sequence (data not shown) has already been assembled. MX1 expression was up-regulated in FIPV infection (Table \n1), similar to other RNA virus infections, its role in FIP pathogenesis is still unclear and requires further investigation. Previous studies have shown that the expression of MX1 gene inhibits viral replication during various RNA virus infections\n[28,29]. Early in vitro FIPV infection is also associated with a marked increase in the expression of RSAD2 (radical S-adenosyl methionine domain-containing protein 2) also known as viperin (Table \n1). Previous studies have shown viperin involvement in inhibiting viral RNA and/or protein synthesis during different virus infections, such as the West Nile virus, Dengue virus, and hepatitis virus\n[30,31]. Hence, further study is required to define the role of viperin in FIPV replication and infection. Serine Proteinase Inhibitor clade B member 1 (SERPINB1) is the only gene that was markedly down-regulated (Table \n2). SERPINB1 functions as an inhibitor of the neutrophil serine proteases, found at inflammatory sites where the inhibition of the gene prevents tissue destruction by phagocytic cells during the virus clearance process by infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes\n[32,33]. Thus, SERPINB1 down-regulation could possibly be part of innate immune response in recruiting phagocytic cells for the proteolytic destruction of infected cells. Besides genes that modulate T cell functions, several genes with pro-apoptotic and/or anti-apoptotic are also differentially regulated; thus highlighting their functions in regulating the apoptosis of virus infected cells (Additional file\n1: Table S1 and Additional file\n1: Table S2). However, the pro-apoptotic gene YAP-65 or YAP-1, which was found up-regulated in FIV infection in CRFK cells\n[34], was not up-regulated in this study.",
