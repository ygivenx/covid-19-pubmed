It is the major pathogen of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. It is estimated that FHV-1 infection accounts for approximately 50\u201375% of URTD in susceptible cats and more than 90% of the cats are seropositive to FHV-1 [2, 3]. So far, only one serotype of FHV-1 has been identified but its distribution is worldwide [1]. Like other alpha herpesviruses, FHV-1 induces latency in the trigeminal ganglions after the primary infection and the latent virus can be activated by stress and other factors that compromise host immune function [1, 4]. About 45% of latently infected cats shed virus periodically [5]",

However, it often yields false negative results for FHV-1 detection in latent infection. As over 90% of cats are seropositive to FHV-1, and seroprevalence does not vary significantly among clinically normal and diseased cats, it is believed that antibody testing hardly aids the diagnosis of FHV-1 infection [3]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for FHV-1 infection with real time PCR having higher sensitivity than conventional PCR [2, 6\u20138].",

            "text": "Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology [9], has been explored for molecular detection of diverse pathogens [10\u201313]. The RPA process employs three enzymes-a recombinase, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and a strand-displacing polymerase. The recombinase is capable of pairing oligonucleotide primers with homologous sequence in the target DNA. SSB then binds to the displaced strand of DNA and prevents the dissociation of primers. Finally, the strand displacing polymerase begins DNA synthesis where the primer has bound to the target DNA. With the use of two opposing primers, exponential amplification of the target sequence with RPA can be achieved at a constant temperature in 10\u201320 min. The RPA product can be measured in real-time using different probes with fluorescence detection device. In this study, using the fluorescent TwistAmp\u00ae exo Probe (TwistDX, Cambridge, UK), we developed and validated a real-time RPA assay for rapid and specific detection of FHV-1.",

The fluorescent dye FAM was used as a reporter dye in real time PCR. The dye can incorporate into the amplified product, and the fluorescent intensity is proportional with the relative amount of the PCR product, which can be measured in real time and is reflected by the Y-axis value, so called delta Rn value, on a real time PCR plot. The Rn value stands for normalized reporter value. The delta Rn value is the Rn value of an experimental reaction minus the Rn value of the baseline signal generated by the instrument. A cutoff Delta Rn value of 2.000e + 005 (see Fig 2B) after 40 cycles of amplification was established to distinguish positive from negative results. 2.000e + 005 is a notation for 2 x 105. The \"N+m\" formula, where n and m are numbers, is commonly used for a very high number. The format \"2.000e + 005\" was generated automatically by the PCR machine. The sensitivity between the RPA reaction and real time PCR was compared.

Real-time PCR also had a detection limit of 102 copies/reaction (Fig 2B). Thus, in terms of assay sensitivity, these data suggest that exo-RPA is comparable to real time PCR. The co-efficient of variations from 5 independent reactions (102 copies of template) was demonstrated in Table 1, showing high reproducibility for both real time PCR and the RPA assay. A total of 120 clinical samples were tested by exo-RPA and real-time PCR. The results showed a complete diagnostic agreement between RPA and real time PCR (47 positive and 73 negative as shown by both methods).",

            "text": "Reubel et al described a conventional PCR assay for FHV-1 detection [18]. They used agarose gel electrophoresis together with ethidium bromide staining to visualize the PCR product and observed that as low as 3x103 copies of FHV-1 genomic DNA could be detected. Weigler et al developed a real time PCR method for FHV-1 detection, which had a detection limit of 240 copies of FHV-1 DNA [7], in line with our results obtained with real time PCR and the RPA assay. Compared with real time PCR, RPA has several advantages. First, RPA reactions are done at a constant temperature, requiring less-complex instrument. Secondly, RPA reactions are usually completed in 10\u201320 min, much faster than real time PCR that often takes > 60 min. Thirdly, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity (http://www.twistdx.co.uk/images/uploads/docs/TA01cmanual_Combined_Manual_RevI.pdf), eliminating the need of complex shipment and storage containers, which is convenient and fitting for field performance of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests. Lastly, it has been shown that RPA primers and probes carrying 5\u20139 base pair mismatches do not influence the performance of RPA reactions [13, 19], while such base pair mismatches can cause real-time PCR small probes to fail [20].",
