Although global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy has recently resulted in a substantial decline in deaths from AIDS-related causes, HIV was still responsible for approximately a million deaths in 2016. At the same time, 1.8 million new infections occur per year, resulting in a continuous net increase in infected individuals (UNAIDS Report 2017: http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2017/2017_data_book). In the absence of a cure that would eliminate the virus, it is therefore of utmost importance to reduce the number of new infections. Unfortunately, despite enormous efforts to develop immunization strategies against HIV, an AIDS vaccine is currently not in sight (Levine 2008; Virgin and Walker 2010; Haase 2010; Andrabi et al. 2018). Topical (vaginal and rectal) microbicides that potentially prevent new infections, therefore, represent one of the most promising strategies to control the disease (Boyd et al. 1997; Lederman et al. 2004; Mori et al. 2005; Veazey et al. 2005; Rao et al. 2005; Vanpouille et al. 2012; O\u2019Keefe et al. 2015).",

Large-scale screens for peptides, proteins and small molecules that act as virus-cell fusion inhibitors have been conducted and a number of candidate molecules have been identified. One of the first potent antiviral agents that was found to bind to the HIV surface and block viral entry into cells was cyanovirin-N (CV-N), a small protein (11 kDa) of the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum (Boyd et al. 1997). It binds irreversibly to the surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 by targeting N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides (Botos et al. 2002; Bewley et al. 2002; Barrientos and Gronenborn 2002) and, in this way, blocks binding of the virus to its receptors on host cells. Recombinant production of CV-N has been attempted in several systems, including bacteria, transgenic plants and transplastomic plants, but protein yields have been relatively low (Colleluori et al. 2005; Sexton et al. 2006; Gao et al. 2010; Elghabi et al. 2011; O\u2019Keefe et al. 2015).",

While CV-N is active against HIV at low nanomolar concentrations, griffithsin displays anti-viral activity against all isolates of HIV already at picomolar concentrations (Mori et al. 2005; O\u2019Keefe et al. 2009), thus making griffithsin a highly attractive candidate microbicide to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. In addition to its high specific activity against HIV, griffithsin is also extremely resistant to physicochemical degradation and shows high safety (Kouokam et al. 2011). Preclinical development of griffithsin as a potential vaginal microbicide for prevention of HIV transmission is currently underway. Interestingly, griffithsin also displays strong affinity to the envelope glycoproteins of other highly pathogenic viruses, such as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus (O\u2019Keefe et al. 2010; Barton et al. 2014).",

Plants represent a particularly cheap, readily scalable and safe production platform for biopharmaceuticals (Ma et al. 2005; Daniell et al. 2009; Rybicki 2010; Marusic et al. 2009; Bock 2014, 2015; Wong-Arce et al. 2017). Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to develop technologies that enable high-level expression of recombinant proteins in plants, including antibodies, antigens for subunit vaccines and microbicides. Expression of griffithsin has been tested in several expression systems, including viral vector-based transient expression in tobacco leaves (O\u2019Keefe et al. 2009; Hahn et al. 2015; Fuqua et al. 2015a, b) and stable transgenic expression in rice seeds (Vamvaka et al. 2016). While transient expression systems often give high expression levels, they incur additional costs due to the need to transfect each new batch of plant material. By contrast, in stable transgenic plants, the starting material for purification can be provided at the (very low) cost of the biomass. Also, stable transgenic plants provide greater batch-to-batch consistency than transiently transfected plant material (Fujiuchi et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Transgene expression from the plastid (chloroplast) genome offers a number of highly attractive features, including precise transgene insertion by homologous recombination, absence of epigenetic gene silencing, and greatly increased transgene confinement due to maternal inheritance of plastids and their efficient exclusion from pollen in most crops (Maliga 2004; Ruf et al. 2007; Bock 2015). The greatest attraction for molecular farming applications lies in the potential of chloroplast-transformed (transplastomic) plants to accumulate extraordinarily high levels of foreign proteins, often one to three orders of magnitude higher than what is possible to achieve by nuclear transgenesis (De Cosa et al. 2001; Tregoning et al. 2003; Molina et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2008; Oey et al. 2009a, b). However, it is important to note that, while there are numerous cases of spectacularly high expression levels achieved in transplastomic plants, not all foreign proteins accumulate stably in transgenic chloroplasts. Unfortunately, the rules governing protein stability in plastids are only poorly understood (Apel et al. 2010; De Marchis et al. 2012) and, thus, predictions about the success of recombinant protein accumulation in chloroplasts are currently hardly possible. For example, transplastomic expression of CV-N in tobacco was undetectably low, but could be improved by fusion to N-terminal and C-terminal sequences taken from proteins known to be very stable in plastids (Elghabi et al. 2011). Nonetheless, CV-N accumulation levels reached only 0.3% of the total soluble protein (TSP), a value that is two orders of magnitude below the levels attained with PlyGBS, one of the proteins whose N- and C-terminal sequences were used for stabilization of CV-N (Oey et al. 2009a; Elghabi et al. 2011).",

Although CV-N and griffithsin are similar in size and have a similar mode of antiviral action, their primary sequences are very different. Also, CV-N is a prokaryotic (cyanobacterial) protein, while griffithsin is of eukaryotic (red algal) origin. Thus, the two proteins likely evolved different (in)stability determinants which may have different effects on their stability in the chloroplast (representing a prokaryotic system). Expression of griffithsin from the chloroplast genome was attempted recently (Vafaee et al. 2014), but no accumulation levels were reported and no purification and activity tests were performed. We report here that griffithsin can be expressed to very high levels (of approximately 5% of the plant\u2019s total soluble protein) in tobacco chloroplasts and has similar anti-HIV activity as the recombinant protein produced in bacteria. We also show that, due to its enormous thermal stability, (i) griffithsin can be very easily purified from leaf biomass, (ii) high levels of intact protein can be extracted from dried leaves, and (iii) griffithsin isolated from dry tobacco retains high antiviral activity.",

To facilitate protein purification, an N-terminal histidine tag (His6) was added to the coding region (NCBI accession number AY744144.1). The synthetic gene construct was inserted into an expression cassette consisting of the ribosomal RNA operon promoter (Prrn) fused to the strong translation initiation signals derived from the gene10 leader of coliphage T7 (Kuroda and Maliga 2001; see Materials and Methods). The griffithsin cassette was then integrated into a standard plastid transformation vector (Zhou et al. 2008) containing a chimeric spectinomycin resistance gene (aadA) as selectable marker. In this vector, the aadA gene is flanked by loxP sites to facilitate post-transformation removal of the antibiotic resistance marker (Fig. 1a; Corneille et al. 2001).",

Primary spectinomycin-resistant clones (Nt-grft lines) were subjected to additional rounds of selection and regeneration to dilute out residual wild-type copies of the highly polyploid plastid genome and isolate homoplasmic transplastomic tissue. Successful transformation and correct targeting of the grft and aadA transgenes to the intergenic spacer separating the trnfM and trnG genes by homologous recombination was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using Southern blotting (Fig. 1a, b). The results showed the expected hybridization patterns in RFLP analyses with either a probe derived from a neighboring gene in the plastid genome or a probe recognizing the aadA marker gene (Fig. 1b). Absence of a hybridization signal for the wild type-specific fragment preliminarily suggested that the lines were homoplasmic. However, strong exposure of the blots revealed faint hybridization signals corresponding to the expected size of the wild-type plastid DNA fragment (Fig. 1b, and data not shown). Previous work had established that these weak signals come from so-called promiscuous DNA (plastid-derived DNA sequences that are present in the nuclear genome; Hager et al. 1999; Ruf et al. 2000).",

To this end, we crossed homoplasmic transplastomic Nt-grft lines (maternal parent) to a nuclear transgenic Cre-expressing line (pollen donor). The progeny was raised on spectinomycin-containing medium to identify seedlings whose plastid genome was devoid of the aadA gene due to Cre-mediated excision from all copies of the plastid genome. These seedlings were easily recognizable by their spectinomycin-sensitive (pale) phenotype. As expected, the progeny segregated into homogeneously pale (complete aadA excision), variegated (incomplete aadA excision) and green (no or low-level aadA excision) seedlings (Fig. 1c). Homogeneously pale seedlings were rescued by transfer to antibiotic-free medium, after recovery grown to maturity in the greenhouse and then crossed to the wild type (as pollen donor) to eliminate the Cre transgene and the linked nuclear antibiotic resistance marker (a gentamycin resistance gene; Corneille et al. 2001) in the next generation. The resulting completely marker-free transplastomic plants (Nt-grft-mf) have no nuclear transgene anymore, lack the aadA marker in the plastid genome and contain grft as the sole transgene (Figs. 1c, 2).",

This removes the need to respond to increasing demands by producing large amounts of plant biomass, which represents the most time-consuming step in the production process. The long-term storage procedure used in the tobacco industry relies on drying of the harvested leafy biomass. We, therefore, wanted to test whether chloroplast-synthesized griffithsin would remain stable upon drying and during storage, and retain its biological activity. We, therefore, dried leaves harvested from transplastomic griffithsin-producing plants and stored them at room temperature for up to 10 months after harvest. Afterwards, proteins were extracted and purification of griffithsin was attempted. Immunoblot analysis of total soluble protein extracts revealed high recovery of full-length griffithsin from dried tobacco and no evidence of appreciable protein degradation during drying or long-term storage (Fig. 6a).",

            "text": "In the course of this work, we have investigated the possibility to produce the potent anti-HIV protein griffithsin in tobacco chloroplasts. Previous attempts to synthesize cyanovirin-N, a longer known but less potent anti-HIV protein, in trangenic chloroplasts had met with limited success (Elghabi et al. 2011). Cyanovirin-N turned out to be rather unstable in chloroplasts and, although protein accumulation could be improved by fusion to N- and/or C-terminal sequences taken from highly stable proteins, accumulation levels remained relatively low (Elghabi et al. 2011). By contrast, griffithsin, a protein of similar size but unrelated in primary amino acid sequence, accumulated in transplastomic tobacco plants to levels of up to 5% of TSP (Fig. 3). Considering the small size of the recombinant protein (of only 14.5 kDa), this is an exceptionally high expression level that suggests that, unlike cyanovirin-N, griffithsin is highly stable in transgenic chloroplasts. It is important to note that the same expression elements were used for the transplastomic expression of cyanovirin-N and griffithsin, suggesting that the strong difference in protein accumulation is due to differences in protein stability. Why griffithsin is so much more stable than cyanovirin-N is currently unclear. Although some determinants of chloroplast protein (in)stability have recently been uncovered (Apel et al. 2010; De Marchis et al. 2012; Rowland et al. 2015), we are still far from being able to explain why certain proteins are less stable than others (let alone to predict the stability of foreign proteins to be expressed in plastids).",

Interestingly, griffithsin remained stable during drying and long-term storage and retained high antiviral activity (Figs. 5, 6). The IC50 value of griffithsin extracted from dry tobacco is slightly higher than that of griffithsin purified from fresh biomass or from E. coli (Fig. 5c). The reason for this difference is currently unknown and could be related to some activity loss upon drying and/or storage or, alternatively, lower purity of the protein samples due to the different starting material and/or differences in sample preparation (leading to an overestimation of the griffithsin concentration and thus giving lower apparent activity). Nonetheless, similar to rice grains (Vamvaka et al. 2016), dried tobacco leaves provide an attractive option for long-term storage of large amounts of raw material for griffithsin extraction upon demand. This is of particular importance to the potential use of griffithsin in the developing world, where the demand for anti-HIV microbicides is greatest. Although griffithsin can be expressed also to high levels by transient transformation of fresh biomass (O\u2019Keefe et al. 2009), the procedures involved are too complicated and demanding to be implemented locally.",

The transgenes are targeted to the intergenic region between two plastid tRNA genes, trnfM and trnG (Zhou et al. 2008). Expression of the grft transgene is driven by the plastid rRNA operon promoter fused to the gene10 leader sequence of coliphage T7 and the 3\u2032 UTR of the plastid rbcL gene. The aadA expression cassette consists of a chimeric plastid rRNA operon promoter and the 3\u2032 UTR of the psbA gene (Svab and Maliga 1993). The expected sizes of the DNA fragments in RFLP analyses with the restriction enzyme BamHI are given below each map. The location of the hybridization probe is indicated as a black bar. b RFLP analysis of transplastomic Nt-grft and Nt-grft-mf plants. DNA samples were digested with BamHI and hybridized to a radiolabelled probe detecting the plastid genome region flanking the transgene insertion site. The homoplasmic state was evidenced by absence of the 4.5 kb fragment characteristic of the wild-type plastid genome and detection of the 6.8 kb fragment specific to the transformed plastid genome. Successful post-transformation excision of the aadA gene (Zhou et al. 2008) and generation of marker-free griffithsin-expressing transplastomic plants (Nt-grft-mf) was initially assayed with the psaB probe (detecting a 5.4 kb fragment) and further confirmed by hybridization to an aadA-specific probe (which exclusively detected the expected 6.8 kb fragment in the marker gene-containing Nt-grft plants). Wt wild type. c Inheritance assay and identification of marker-free transplastomic lines. Germination of the T1 generation of Nt-grft plastid transformants in the presence of spectinomycin revealed homoplasmic presence of the selectable marker gene aadA. While wild-type seedlings emerge white in the presence of the antibiotic, all seedlings of transplastomic plants are uniformly resistant to spectinomycin. The progeny of Nt-grft plants crossed to nuclear-transgenic plants expressing a plastid-targeted Cre recombinase (Nt-grft-2 \u00d7 Cre) segregates into 50% fully green seedlings (due to hemizygous presence of the cre recombinase gene in the parental line), variegated and completely white seedlings in the presence of spectinomycin. The white seedlings, expected to be completely devoid of the aadA marker, were rescued by transfer to antibiotic-free medium, subsequently grown to maturity in the greenhouse and pollinated with wild-type pollen. Uniformly white appearance of the progeny (Nt-grft-mf) upon germination on spectinomycin-containing medium confirmed the complete removal of the aadA marker",
