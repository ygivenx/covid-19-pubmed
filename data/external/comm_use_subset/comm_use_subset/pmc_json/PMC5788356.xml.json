            "text": "Coronaviruses, a genus of the Coronaviridae, are enveloped single positive-stranded RNA viruses, which have the largest viral genome (26-33kb) among the RNA viruses [1\u20132]. The Coronaviridae family comprises two subfamilies as Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, and Coronavirinae can be subdivided into four groups, the alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses by phylogenetic clustering [1\u20134]. Coronaviruses have been identified to infect mammals and birds including bat, mouse, alpacas, swine, dog, cattle, chicken, horse, and also human, etc. [1\u20134], and can cause a variety of diseases including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infection, etc. [4] In humans, coronaviruses (HCoV) are proved to cause respiratory tract infection, most frequently common cold, but can also cause severe respiratory illness including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [4\u20137]. By now, six human coronavirus species have been identified, including OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [4\u20139]. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were identified nearly 50 years ago, which mainly cause common cold in humans, and the recently identified NL63 and HKU1 are reported to cause mild respiratory tract infection, and these 4 coronaviruses can also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in young children or elderly adults with underlying diseases [8\u20139]. HCoV-NL63 is also associated with acute laryngotracheitis (croup) [8\u20139]. SARS-CoV, a group 2b \u03b2-coronavirus, initially emerged in 2002\u20132003 in Guangdong province, south China, which caused severe lower respiratory tract infection with high morbidity and mortality (approaching 50% in individuals over 60 years of age) known as SARS [10\u201311]. In 2012, a novel group 2c \u03b2-coronavirus coronavirus MERS-CoV was firstly identified in Saudi Arabia [12\u201313]. It is the causative agent in a series of highly pathogenic lower respiratory tract infections with high mortality (20% to 40%), which is mainly epidemic in the Middle East, but also brought an outbreak in South Korea in 2014 [7\u20138, 12\u201313].",

But by now, there is no anti-viral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses, and only limited options are available to prevent coronavirus infections [8\u201313]. Therefore, surveillance of the epidemiology of human coronavirus (HCoV) and understanding HCoV epidemiological characteristics are very important for the prediction, prevention and control of HCoV infection. Guangdong is the place that SARS-CoV first emerged. But to date, there is little report about the epidemiological characteristics of HCoV and its species in Guangdong, south China. Our previous studies of 7 respiratory viruses showed that the total viral detection rate of HCoV in south China was 2.47% in 2009\u20132012 [14], but further clarification of the epidemic features of different HCoV species was still needed, and as an important human respiratory virus, the variation features of HCoV-OC43 in Guangzhou at molecular level has not been well addressed.",

From the 5 year distribution, we can see that total HCoV infection rate was relatively low in 2010, 2012 and 2014, and high in 2011 and 2013 (Fig 4A), showing a peak-valley distribution trend (\u03c72 = 136.418, P<0.05). The same trend can be observed for HCoV-OC43 (\u03c72 = 112.955, P<0.05) and HCoV-229E (\u03c72 = 19.255, P<0.05), but it is interesting to see that for HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, a higher epidemic peak can be seen in 2012 and 2014 (for HCoV-HKU1) (Fig 4, \u03c72 = 24.125 and 22.110 respectively, P<0.05), when detection rates of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were relatively lower.",

Totally 2524 nt of OC43 S gene were successfully amplified and sequenced. Bovine CoV (accession no. U00735) was used as outgroup sequence, which was not displayed in the figure. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 15 strains could be divided into 2 clusters, and 12 strains of which were most related to the strain from France (GI: 721684923), and the remaining 3 strains were most related to the strains from Beijing (GI: 744516692) and France (GI: 721684917), as shown in Fig 6A. Because in the phylogenetic tree of S gene, these 12 strains formed a separate cluster, distant from the other 3 strains, we further analyzed the genotype of these 12 strains. Eighteen other S gene sequences of OC43 were used as reference strains, including ATCC-VR759 (AY585229, AY585228 and NC005147) as genotype A reference, BE-03 (AY903459) as genotype B reference, HK04-01 (JN129834) as genotype C reference, HK04-02 (JN129835) and OC43 BE-04 (AY903460) as genotype D reference, KF572812 as genotype E reference, and Malaysia strains KX538973 (MY-U868/12) and KX538970 (MY-U710/12) as genotype F and G reference, respectively. It was shown that these distinct 12 strains were more close to the novel genotype G (Fig 6B), whereas the other 3 strains were close to genotype B. The partial S gene sequences of 15 strains of 2013\u20132014 in Guangzhou were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KX447776- KX447790.",

But the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV changed the recognition. The high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV brought renewed interest and concerns in this virus family, and further research on the origin of SARS- and MERS-CoV revealed the possibility of coronavirus variation and transmission from animal hosts to human beings [1\u20132,11,27\u201328]. Therefore, the surveillance of coronavirus in humans as well as in animals is very necessary and important for HCoV variation research and infection control. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is very limited report of HCoVs molecular epidemiology in Guangzhou and the variation report about HCoV is few. Therefore, in this study, the molecular epidemiological characteristics of HCoVs in pediatric and adult patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms in Guangzhou from 2010\u20132015 were investigated, and the phylogenetic and genotypic analysis of S gene of the most prevalent HCoV species OC43 was performed, and the epidemic of the novel OC43 genotype G in Guangzhou was for the first time observed.",

Totally 39.29% of the patients were detected as positive for at least one of the 8 respiratory viruses. The detection rates, age and month distributions of Influenza, PIV, RSV, HMPV, HRV, AdV and HBoV were consistent with our previous studies and other reports (Figs 1 and 2) [14,25,29]. HCoV was detected in 2.25% (294 positive) patients with respiratory infection symptoms, with the detection rate as 2.95% of inpatients and 0.95% of outpatients. The detection rate was significantly higher in inpatient than outpatient (P<0.01), including adult and children (P<0.05), and the detection rate was especially higher in infant inpatients (Table 1), and the odds of HCoV infection resulting in admission or severe disease were 3.17, showing that HCoV infection is dangerous especially for infants and toddlers. Real-time RT-PCR was used for HCoVs detection, to increase the sensitivity and avoid cross contamination and false positive. The higher sensitivity of real-time PCR method may contribute to the higher detection rate of HCoV in our study compared with Jinan and Hongkong that used traditional RT-PCR for HCoV screening [30\u201332], and may be a better method in HCoV surveillance. Nevertheless, because HCoV detection rate varies in different regions and countries [30\u201335], another reason for different detection rates may also lie in region distribution. Totally 4 HCoV species including HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 were detected during 2010\u20132015 in Guangzhou, and no SARS and MERS-CoV was detected, confirming that the outbreak of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV in year 2015 in South Korea did not spread to Guangzhou. Of the locally epidemic HCoVs, OC43 was the most commonly detected, followed by 229E and NL63, and HKU1 detection rate was the lowest.",

Different HCoVs showed different epidemic months and seasons (Fig 3 and S1 Fig). OC43 was prevalent throughout the year, whereas 229E was prevalent mainly in winter (especially in February). NL63 was most epidemic in summer and winter, whereas the peak of HKU1 appeared in winter (January and February) and disappeared in September to December. The 5 year distribution of HCoVs during 2010\u20132015 in Guangzhou shows an every other year trend of epidemiology, a peak-valley distribution, that is, relatively lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014, and higher in 2011 and 2013 (Fig 4). Similar phenomena could be found in the study of Dare RK et al [36], but there was only 2 years of data in that study [36]. Therefore, data from continuous of surveillance is very important to reveal the pattern of HCoV epidemiology. Further analysis found that this trend mainly came from OC43 year distribution, and secondly, 229E distribution. However, in 2012 and 2014, when the detection rates of OC43 and 229E were relatively low, the infection rates of NL63 and HKU1 were high, and both of them showed a peak in 2012 (Fig 4). From the 5 year distribution data, we can see that in Guangzhou the infection rate of HCoV was dramatically increased after 2010, and take on a peak-valley pattern (Fig 4 and Table 4). More years of surveillance are needed to confirm this HCoV epidemic pattern in Guangzhou.",

Our results showed that young children not in nursery had the highest risk of HCoV infection (53.06% of the HCoV positive patients). The reason may be that most children <3 years old in China are not in nursery, and they usually stay at home with their family guardians. Since HCoV infection is common in adults and elder people, we deduce that the most of sporadic infection should come from the guardians of those young children, and therefore protective measures for children guardians are very important for HCoV prevention and control. From the age distribution, we found that <15 year old children and >50 year elder people were both high risk groups of HCoV infection, and the risk was particularly higher in infants under 1 year old (Fig 2), but there were differences between HCoVs. OC43 mainly infected <3 years infants and toddlers, whereas 229E more likely infected elder children of 7\u201315 years. NL63 more likely infected middle aged adults of 35\u201350 years, but HKU1 tended to infect elder people of 50\u201365 years. These epidemiological characteristics may help to understand the pathogenicity of HCoV and prevent HCoV infection.",

In 2015, a new genotype E was identified which was reported to have arisen due to natural recombination [39]. Recently, 2 new genotypes of OC43 were reported as F and G genotypes in Malaysia [40], indicating that OC43 were evolving continuously. However, due to the limited availability of HCoV-OC43 sequences, the variation of HCoV-OC43, especially its genotyping, remained to be further elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the genotypes based on partial S gene sequences of 15 HCoV-OC43 strains from positive samples during 2013\u20132014 using PCR amplification and sequencing. We found that 3 strains were closer to genotype B, but the remaining 12 strains were more close to the newly defined genotype G in the phylogenetic trees (Fig 6B). Recombinant analysis was also performed with negative results, indicating that genotype drift may be one of an important way for HCoV-OC43 to maintain its epidemic. This is for the first time that genotype G is reported to be epidemic as a dominant genotype during 2013\u20132014 in Guangzhou, south China. The epidemic of genotype G in Guangzhou may be a result of personnel exchange between China and Southeast Asia countries including Malaysia. Further complete genome sequencing will be needed to understand the phylogenic characteristics of these G genotype strains circulating in Guangzhou.",
