            "text": "To establish a culture system for differentiated porcine airway epithelial cells, primary porcine tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells (PTEC and PBEC, respectively) were cultured in a transwell filter system. When the cell monolayer had reached confluence, the medium was removed from the apical compartment and \u2013 under these ALI conditions - the cells started to differentiate. PTEC and PBEC were maintained at ALI conditions for at least 5 weeks. The presence of cilia, which is considered as an indicator of the extent of differentiation, was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A,B). Interestingly, cilia expression (in red) was more pronounced on PBEC (Fig. 1B) in comparison to PTEC (Fig. 1A). Immature short cilia were first observed on cells at the border of the filter supports of cultures maintained for 7 days under ALI conditions (data not shown). The amount of cilia further increased until week 7 of cultivation. During the differentiation process, the monolayer adopted the appearance of a pseudostratified epithelium. Mucin production (in green) was demonstrated by mucin-5 AC staining after 5 weeks of culture under ALI conditions in both PTEC (Fig. 1A) and PBEC (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the presence of tight junctions was demonstrated by a positive staining for occludin (Fig. 1C,D), reflecting morphological stability and barrier function of PTEC and PBEC. As shown in Fig. 1E, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed mature cilia at a high percentage of the epithelial surface of well-differentiated PBEC 7 weeks after cultivation under ALI conditions. A peak value of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) at 6 days of culture under ALI conditions indicated that PTEC and PBEC had adopted a polarized organization (Fig. 1F). Afterwards TEER values decreased to some extent, but remained constant over the remaining observation period of 40 days. Taken together, we established well-differentiated porcine airway epithelial cells under ALI conditions in vitro, which closely resemble the cells of the airway epithelium.",

In addition we tested two complemented strains expressing suilysin with single amino-acid substitutions, one of which carried a silent mutation (suilysin derivative S148) and the other one which resulted in lack of cytolytic macropore formation (suilysin derivative W461F). The strains were generated by complementation of strain 10\u0394sly with either of two point-mutated suilysin genes, designated strain cS148, and strain cW461F, respectively. We included those strains to confirm possible effects of suilysin by complementation (strain cS148) and to elucidate whether effects might require cytolyctic activity of the toxin or not (strain cW416F). In previous studies we observed that suilysin derivative W461F does not induce any cytolytic pores39, and that suilysin derivative S148 is similarly active as the wt suilysin (unpublished results).",

As shown in Figure S1, at the indicated times colonizing bacteria on the apical side of cells were quantified by plating. The wt strain and all mutant strains were able to colonize the apical side of PBEC, since the bacterial numbers remained constant over the whole observation period of 72 hours. Similar results were obtained with PTEC (results not shown). No differences in bacterial growth were observed between the parental strain and the different mutants incubated with either of the two cell types (shown for PBEC in Figure S1). These results showed that S. suis can efficiently colonize the apical side of PTEC and PBEC under ALI conditions with similar kinetics. Our findings indicate that this culture system for well-differentiated airway epithelial cell can be applied to analyze S. suis infection in vitro.",

As shown in Fig. 2A, cytotoxicity induced by the wt strain increased in a time-dependent manner from 4 hpi to 72 hpi. LDH release induced by the wt strain at 4 hpi in PBEC (4-fold increase) was similar to that in PTEC (3-fold), but at 48 hpi it was significantly higher in PBEC (7.3 fold) than in PTEC (2.3 fold). To elucidate whether cytotoxic effects would also influence integrity of the cellular barrier, we determined the TEER of PTEC and PBEC, which is indicative of the formation of tight junctions and an intact epithelial barrier23. Results revealed that mock-infected PTEC and PBEC remained unaffected until end of the experiment (96 hpi). In comparison, TEER of PTEC and PBEC infected with the wt strain showed a significant decrease starting at 72 hpi and 48 hpi, respectively, whereas that of PTEC/PBEC infected by either of the two suilysin-deficient mutants was similar to the control (Figure S2).",

The ability of S. suis to adhere to and colonize well-differentiated epithelial cells was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy at 4 hpi. PBEC were apically infected with 1 \u00d7 107 CFU of S. suis per filter. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h, cells were washed thoroughly to remove non-adherent bacteria and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. As shown in Fig. 3A, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that streptococci were able to adhere to PBEC. Bound bacteria were mainly detected on ciliated cells. As shown in Fig. 3F, quantification of adherent bacteria revealed that suilysin-positive S. suis wt strain adhered to PBEC (0.16%) with significantly higher efficiency than the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394sly (0.075%), respectively. The number of adherent wt bacteria was 2-fold higher than that of 10\u0394sly on PBEC cells. This result is consistent with a previous report that suilysin promotes the adherence of S. suis to the immortalized respiratory epithelial cell line HEp-2 and porcine ex vivo precision-cut lung slices3739. Interestingly, adherence of the two complemented strains cW461F and cS148, respectively, was similar to that of the wt and significantly higher than that of the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394sly. These results suggest that macropore-formation of suilysin was not involved in promotion of S. suis adherence to PBEC. On the other hand, it has been reported that nonencapsulated S. suis strain showed higher capacity of adherence to and invasion of host cells in comparison to the parental strain4243. Therefore, we also included a suilysin-deficient nonencapsulated mutant (10\u0394cps\u0394sly). As shown in Fig. 3A, lack of a capsule enhanced the adherence of the suilysin-deficient mutant to PBEC. Quantification of microscopic examinations confirmed significantly higher adherence of the nonencapsulated mutant 10\u0394cps\u0394sly as compared to the encapsulated wt and the mutant 10\u0394sly (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that suilysin and the capsule can both affect the adherence of S. suis to well-differentiated epithelial cells. Suilysin shows an enhancing effect on S. suis adherence to airway epithelial cells, which is independent of macropore-formation, whereas the capsule has a reducing effect.",

Quantification of the microscopic data revealed that more than 40%, 18% and 35% of all detected bacteria were located intracellularly in PBEC in the case of the suilysin-positive wt strain, strain cW461F and strain cS148, respectively (Fig. 4F). In contrast, invasion rates of both suilysin-deficient mutants were significantly lower (2.6% for 10\u0394sly, below detection limit for 10\u0394cps\u0394sly). The clear difference between wt and mutant S. suis was also found in the invasion of PTEC, for which the rate of intracellular wt bacteria was 28% (data not shown). We conclude that suilysin is crucial for efficient invasion of S. suis into airway epithelial cells, and that cytolytic activity of suilysin contributes significantly to this effect, since strain cW461F was significantly less invasive than wt strain and strain cS148. Nevertheless, there was a significant difference between invasion rates of both suilysin-negative mutants and strain cW461F (Fig. 4F), suggesting that there may be invasion-promoting effects of suilysin which do not depend on cytolytic activity.",

In these experiments the suilysin-positive wt strain and the complemented strain cS148 induced damage to the PBEC resulting in the loss of a large proportion of ciliated cells at 48hpi (Fig. 5A). Vertical sections of these samples illustrate that the loss of the ciliated cells enables the wt and cS148 bacteria to invade to deeper areas of the cell layer (Fig. 5B). Strain cW461F was able to invade PBEC to a certain extent and caused only moderate local lesions at 48 hpi. In striking contrast, the suilysin-deficient mutants 10\u0394sly and 10\u0394cps\u0394sly remained adherent to ciliated cells and were unable to cross this barrier. This effect was more pronounced at 96 hpi (Fig. 5C), when just a few cilia were detectable and invasive S. suis wt even reached the basal area of the epithelial cell layer. Similar results were obtained with strain cS148, i. e. many bacteria crossed the epithelial barrier. Accordingly, despite large numbers of adherent bacteria at 96 hpi, the suilysin-deficient nonencapsulated mutant 10\u0394cps\u0394sly was unable to invade the ciliated epithelium. Interestingly, infection of PBEC by the point-mutated suilysin cW461F for 96h revealed many intracellular bacteria but hardly any damaged ciliated epithelial cells or bacteria invading deeper areas (Fig. 5). These results indicate that subcytolytic effects of suilysin contribute to the invasion of S. suis into PBEC. However, macropore-formation seems to further promote tissue invasion by causing epithelium damage.",

High density of membrane-associated suilysin was detectable on apoptotic cells, which is consistent with the localization of suilysin-positive wt streptococci in invasion areas described above (Fig. 6A). As expected, no suilysin and only few cleaved caspase-3 positive cells were detected in PBEC infected by the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394sly. Interestingly, accumulated membrane-associated suilysin was detected in the complemented strain cW461F infected PBEC, but this accumulated suilysin did not induce increased apoptotic cells (as shown in Fig. 6C). Quantification of apoptotic cells revealed that suilysin-positive S. suis wt strain and complemented strain cS148 induced a 40-fold and 35-fold increase of apoptotic cells compared to mock infection of PBEC, respectively. Increases were significantly higher than those caused by the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394sly (5-fold) and complemented strain cW461F (8-fold).

S. suis had been analyzed using a variety of immortalized respiratory epithelial cells1231323942, as well as polar porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells and human choroid plexus papilloma cells4546. Recently, we used precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) as a culture system to analyze the co-infection of porcine differentiated respiratory epithelial cells by swine influenza virus and S. suis37. PCLS are maintained in culture medium, whereas ALI cultures acquire their nutrients from the medium only via the basolateral membrane, and the apical side of the cells has contact to air. In this respect the ALI system most closely resembles the situation of the airway epithelial cells in their respective host. We found that streptococci efficiently grow on the apical side of the airway epithelial cells in the absence of apical culture medium. Therefore, ALI cultures are an appropriate model system to analyze the infection of well-differentiated airway epithelial cells by S. suis. In the future, it should be interesting also to study the infection by other bacterial pathogens.",

However, we cannot directly compare invasiveness of S. suis in both culture systems, since quantification was done by different methods due to the models applied in the present and the previous study. Because of the very low invasion of immortalized cells, encapsulated S. suis is considered as an extracellular bacterium313942. It has been suggested that invasion by this streptococcus requires the down-regulation of the capsule to achieve efficient adherence and subsequent invasion. Following invasion, the capsule would have to be upregulated again to ensure bacterial survival in the blood stream. However, this has never been demonstrated in vivo. Our data show that encapsulated S. suis is very efficient in invasion suggesting that differential expression of the capsule may not be essential for efficient invasion.",

As suilysin is a soluble protein, the high efficiency of this process in the case of ALI cultures can be explained by the higher local concentration of this protein in the absence of apical medium. In the case of immortalized cells, suilysin produced by S. suis is immediately diluted by the medium and, thus, a homogeneous and low concentration of the protein is available for interaction with the cell surface.

In fact, immunostaining revealed large amounts of cell surface-located suilysin molecules, at least some of which might represent formation oligomeric pore complexes. The large amount of suilysin may again be explained by the ALI culture conditions that enable high local concentrations of the toxin. The strong cytotoxic effect of suilysin also explains the lesions that were observed at 24 hpi in the aiway epithelial cell layer that expanded until the whole epithelium was damaged. Future studies have to analyze why the cellular damage appeared to be more pronounced in bronchial cells than in tracheal cells.",

It results in the loss of their barrier function and allows the bacteria to get access to deeper areas of the epithelium that are usually not exposed to the environment. This conclusion is supported by our infection studies with PCLS, another culture system for differentiated airway epithelial cells37. It has been suggested that dead cells may provide a rich source of nutrition and growth factors and thus enhance streptococcal growth48. We found larger numbers of bacteria in areas where the epithelium had been damaged. Interestingly, the infection with the complemented strain cW461F, which could only express subcytolytic toxin effects, revealed a high number of invasive bacteria in PBEC but only moderate damaging effects. These results demonstrate that macropore-formation acticity and subcytolytic effects of suilysin promote invasion of S. suis.",

Apoptosis may be triggered by a variety of physiological and pathological stimuli4451. Our results show that infection by S. suis induces suilysin-dependent apoptosis which is very likely to be responsible for the damage and death of differentiated epithelial cells. Results of experiments with the complemented strain cW461F revealed that macropore-formation of suilysin is required for induction of apoptosis in airway epithelial cells. However, at present it remains unclear what the underlying mechanisms are. In S. pneumoniae a pneumolysin-induced calcium influx has been shown to mediate apoptosis in neuronal tissues5253. Thus, it is plausible to speculate that suilysin-induced apoptosis in airway epithelial cells may be initiated by calcium influx through the pores in the plasma membrane. Calcium influx induced by suilysin was observed in HEp-2 cells (unpublished data). Whether this can be translated to PBEC remains to be clarified in future studies.",

Formaldehyde-fixed preparations were washed and 0.1 M glycine in PBS was added for 5 min, after then samples were washed 3 times with PBS and followed by incubation in blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS to block nonspecific binding sites. All antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS. Blocking buffer was removed and preparations were incubated with rabbit anti-S. suis antiserum diluted 1:200 for 1h. After washed with PBS, samples were incubated for 45 min with green fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody 1:1000 diluted (Life Technologies) to stain extracellular streptococci. Following, the preparations were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min.
