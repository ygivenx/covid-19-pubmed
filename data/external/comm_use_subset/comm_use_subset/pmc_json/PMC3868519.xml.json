Even larger outbreaks later occurred in Malaysia in 1997 and subsequently in Taiwan in 1998 [4], [5]. Since 2008, over 6.5 million cases including over 1300 fatalities have been reported in China according to the official report from China Ministry of Health. Forty-eight HFMD cases in Thailand and 411 cases in Vietnam have also been reported in 2008\u20132009 [6], [7]. In last April, 50 fatalities and at least 60 cases were reported in Cambodia [8]. So far, HFMD has become a great threat to public health in developing countries in Asia.",

For example, infiltration of inflammatory cells has been observed in the brain stem and spinal cord of patients who died of PE [11]\u2013[13]. Consistently, it has been found that IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and monokine induced by IFN-\u03b3 (MIG; CXCL9) express at significantly higher levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of the PE patients than in those with isolated BE [14]\u2013[16]. In addition, systemic levels of IFN-\u03b3-induced protein (IP)-10, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and CXCL9 are also significantly higher in patients with PE than in those with uncomplicated BE [15], [17]. The serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are generally higher in CNS-complicated patients than in patients with uncomplicated HFMD or healthy controls [17]. One unexplained manifestation in PE patients is that they have significantly fewer circulating T cells and natural killer (NK) cells but more neutrophils [16].",

Thus, intravenous immunoglobulin has been administrated as an immunomodulator to severe HFMD patients at high risk of progressing to PE [18]. In addition, milrinone therapy has been shown to reduce plasma levels of IL-13 and concomitantly sympathetic hyperactivity, suggesting that it has immunomodulatory effect [18]. Since 2008, glucocorticoids, including hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone, have been empirically used to treat severe HFMD patients with CNS complications and PE. In a consensus statement of HFMD and EV71 infection in China issued in 2010 by an expert panel, glucocorticoids were also recommended for use in patients developing severe CNS complications and PE (http://www.jkb.com.cn/htmlpage/12/123560.htm?docid=123560&cat=null&sKeyWord=null). Despite the controversy on the rationale and benefits of glucocorticoid therapy in severe enterovirus infection or other viral infections [20]\u2013[22], glucocorticoids indeed have been widely used in the management of severe HFMD with CNS complications in China [23]\u2013[26]. However, little is known so far about the immunomodulatory effects and clinical benefits of glucocorticoid treatment in HFMD patients.",

Gender difference and methylprednisolone treatment were not in our initial consideration for enrollment. Serum samples were taken from the HFMD patients admitted to the infectious disease wards and 20 non-HFMD patients who had minor operations for inguinal hernia or hydrocele at the surgical wards. EV71 infection was diagnosed based on detection of virus in stool specimens. Stool samples from all patients were tested for the presence of enterovirus infection by real-time RT-PCR assay using a commercial kit (Da An Gene Co., Ltd. Lot No.: EV-A71 YZB- 0356-2009).",

The present study also revealed that even the relatively mild HFMD patients without complications had significantly more neutrophils and fewer lymphocytes than the control group. The increased levels of chemokines MCP-3 and CXCL9 and the decreased levels of MIP-1\u03b2, CCL27, and CXCL1 in this study imply that the altered numbers of leukocytes in peripheral blood may result from the differential chemotactic functions of these chemokines. In particular, CXCL9 is an inducible T-cell chemoattractant that is regulated by IFN-\u03b3 and mediates the recruitment of effector T cells to sites of inflammation [34]. The decreased number of T cells and NK cells may result from sequestration from the peripheral blood to infected tissue sites because of systemic increased levels of CXCL9, which is fueled by systemic increased IFN-\u03b3. The dysregulation of other chemokines may contribute to the higher number of circulating neutrophils.",

Nevertheless, the treatment had a tendency to increase the expression levels of IL-17A (one of the other 24 serum biomarkers) in the CNS-complicated HFMD patients. IL-17A as a Th17 cytokine plays a pathogenic role in CNS-related inflammation, such as multiple sclerosis [35]. Thus, it is unlikely that HFMD patients benefit from methylprednisolone treatment through its induction of IL-17A.",

Gender difference was not considered in the initial enrollment of patients. As a result, majority of mild patients were male and had a bias sex ratio in comparison to the severe patients. One of possible reasons is that the male patients were preferentially hospitalized during the enrollment. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the cytokine and chemokine expression profiles between male patients and female patients (data not shown). Second, the effect of methylprednisolone treatment was analyzed retrospectively, thus the observations require further justification in a prospective study. Third, limited number of patients with CNS-complications made us impossible to analyze the biomarkers associated with the most critical CNS-complication with cardio-respiratory dysfunction. Further investigation using a large cohort with various CNS complications will likely overcome the limitations.",
