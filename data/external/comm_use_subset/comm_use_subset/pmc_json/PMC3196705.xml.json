In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), ribosomal frameshifting occurs at a frequency of 5-10% and involves two structural elements, a slippery heptamer at which the translating ribosome can slip by 1 nucleotide in the 5' direction, and a RNA secondary stem-loop structure as stimulator of ribosomal frameshifting 3' to the slippery sequence [3]. Retroviral ribosomal frameshifting or termination read-through not only permit Pol precursor synthesis, but also are essential for maintenance of the specific ratio of Gag-Pol to Gag precursor proteins. For orthoretroviruses an adequate ratio of these two precursor proteins is critical for capsid assembly, infectivity, and incorporation of the viral RNA genome [4-8]. It is generally believed that orthoretroviral Gag-Pol is incorporated into the virion via interactions with the Gag precursor, although particle association of Pol has been reported for murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV, when artificially expressed as a separate protein [9,10]. Orthoretroviral Gag-Pol copackaging is dependent on both the major homology region and adjacent C-terminal capsid sequences that are present in both proteins. The Gag-Pol precursor itself is unable to correctly assemble into infectious orthoretroviral particles.",

FVs seem to regulate the relative cellular expression levels of Gag and Pol by the use of a suboptimal Pol splice site [12]. As a consequence to this unusual Pol biosynthesis FVs have developed a special strategy to ensure Pol particle incorporation, essential for generation of infectious virions. Both Gag and Pol precursor proteins of FVs bind to full-length genomic viral transcripts [13,14]. Additionally protein-protein interactions between Gag and Pol seem to be involved in this assembly process as well [15]. Furthermore, only the PFV Pol precursor p127Pol and not its mature processing products p85PR-RT and p40IN are incorporated into virions that preassemble their capsids intracellularly, close to the centrosome in a B/D type fashion [13,16].",

Different artificial PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs, including in-frame fusions and ribosomal frameshift mediated fusions, were generated. They were characterized in a proviral as well as in a replication-deficient vector system context to examine the effects of orthoretroviral-like PFV Gag-Pol fusion protein expression on virion morphogenesis, release, and infectivity. In particular, we were interested in determining whether, similar to orthoretroviruses, the ratio of FV Gag to Gag-Pol fusion proteins is very critical for particle morphogenesis. Furthermore, we determined whether unprocessed PFV Gag-Pol fusion proteins alone support capsid assembly and release.",

This apparently non-particle-associated Pol precursor protein was pelleted through 20% sucrose in a similar fashion as particle-associated Pol proteins and other viral structural proteins. A major difference was the absence of Pol cleavage products p85PR-RT and p40IN in supernatant pellets when Pol was expressed alone, whereas both processing products were present in the corresponding cell lysates (Figure 1A, lane 8, 14). In addition, this extracellular Pol precursor appeared to be present as free protein and not in a lipid membrane enveloped vesicular form because it was completely sensitive to subtilisin digestion (Figure 1A, lane 7, 8). This suggested that the PFV Pol precursor protein, but not its processing products, is released into the supernatant by non-conventional secretion mechanisms as it lacks a classical signal peptide sequence [19].",

To examine whether this really reflects not yet or incompletely processed particle-associated precursor protein or alternatively copurified extraparticular p127Pol, we generated wild type PFV particle preparations originating from various sources. Viral supernatants were obtained either by transient transfection of replication-deficient vector constructs and proviral expression vectors in 293T cells or alternatively from infected BHK/LTR(PFV)lacZ cultures. Subsequently, particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose and duplicate samples were digested either with subtilisin or mock incubated. The analysis of the protein composition of these samples revealed that the majority of p127Pol precursor present in these different particle preparations was sensitive to subtilisin digestion and therefore most probably was not particle-associated (Figure 1A, lane 1-6). In contrast, the Pol processing product p40IN was resistant to subtilisin digestion whereas, in some experiments, a limited subtilisin sensitivity of the p85PR-RT subunit was observed. PFV Gag p71Gag and p68Gag proteins were always insensitive to subtilisin digestion (Figure 1A, lane 1-6). Furthermore, as expected, the extracellular Env subunit gp80SU was completely digested by subtilisin treatment whereas digestion of the LP protein gp18LP removed only its extracellular C-terminal domain resulting in a protein with lower molecular weight (Figure 1A, lane 1-6).",

For Pol proteins the result was different. The highest amounts of Pol processing products p85PR-RT and p40IN were in accordance with the fraction infectivities (Figure 1C, upper panel). In contrast, a shift toward higher density fractions associated with lower infectivities was observed for the amount of p127Pol precursor protein present in these particle preparations (Figure 1C, upper panel). Subtilisin digestion of concentrated particles prior to velocity gradient centrifugation led to a shift of the major PFV particle containing fractions (fractions 5-8) to a lower density and the complete removal of gp80SU and p127Pol but not the mature p85PR-RT and p40IN Pol subunits (Figure 1C-E, middle panels). The lower density of the subtilisin-digested PFV particles probably reflects the removal of the extracellular domains of the envelope subunits. NP40 treatment of virions prior and during velocity gradient centrifugation resulted in a shift of the major Gag and Pol protein containing fractions toward higher densities, probably representing membrane stripped PFV capsids (Figure 1C-D, lower panels). Furthermore, an overall broader density distribution of these proteins compared to untreated samples was observed, which might be an indication for an increased rate of disassembly of naked capsids (Figure 1C-D, lower panels). However, by this treatment no clear separation of Pol precursor and its cleavage products was observed (Figure 1C, lower panel). In contrast, Env subunits were physically separated from the Gag and Pol proteins, banding predominantly at very low densities (Figure 1C-F, lower panels). Interestingly, gp80SU and gp18LP proteins showed a different density distribution (Figure 1E+F, lower panels), which might suggest that they are found not in a detergent-resistant protein complex in the viral particle.",

To examine whether expression of an orthoretroviral-like Gag-Pol fusion protein is compatible with PFV replication, in particular virion morphogenesis, release and infectivity, we generated several constructs expressing artificial PFV Gag-Pol fusion proteins (Figure 2). We created expression constructs for pure in-frame Gag-Pol fusion proteins, differing only in their Gag domains and the presence of PFV PR cleavage sites between the Gag and Pol ORF (GP1, GP2, GP3 and GP4). In addition, we designed an expression construct separating PFV Gag and Pol ORF by a minimal HIV-1 Gag/Pol ribosomal frameshift site (GfP1). Translation of this construct's mRNA should result in a protein mixture, containing full-length PFV Gag with some additional HIV-1 Gag derived C-terminal amino acids (aa) and a PFV Gag-Pol fusion protein with an intervening PFV PR cleavage site and some HIV-1 Gag/Pol frameshift site encoded aa, at a ratio as observed for HIV Gag and Gag-Pol protein expression. For some constructs variants with catalytically inactive PFV PR (D24A mutation) were generated (GP1 iPR, GfP1 iPR) to examine the particle assembly and release potential of the Gag-Pol fusion proteins instead of a mixture of precursor protein and its cleavage products derived from the respective parental constructs.",

The biochemical analysis of cell lysates demonstrated similar Gag, Env and Bet expression levels for the individual constructs (Figure 3A, C, D, E, lane 1-9). Some differences in the reactivity of the gp130Env and gp170Env-Bet precursor proteins to anti-SU and anti-LP antibodies were noted. The reason for this is currently unclear. However, preliminary data suggest that the anti-SU monoclonal antibody does not recognize all cell-associated PFV Env species equally well (data not shown). In general, only very low levels of Gag-Pol fusion precursor proteins were detectable (Figure 3A, B, lane 3-9). Only for the GP4 protein (PGP4), containing just the natural RT-IN cleavage site in the Pol coding sequences, as well as for the GfP1 and GP1 variants with catalytically inactive PFV PR domains (PGfP1 iPR, PGP1 iPR), higher fusion protein precursor levels were observed (Figure 3A, B, lane 4, 6, 9). In contrast, all fusion constructs with natural or artificial PFV PR cleavage sites at the C-terminus of the Gag coding sequences and active PFV PR domains (PGfP1, PGP1, PGP2 and PGP3) expressed Gag-specific products at levels comparable to the authentic proviral expression construct (Figure 3A, lane 1, 3, 5, 7, 8). Expression of p68Gag was detectable in samples transfected with proviral constructs PGfP1, PGP1, PGP2 and PGP3, whereas it was absent in GfP1iPR and GP1iPR expressing cells (Figure 3A, lane 3-8).

Quite the opposite was observed for most constructs having Gag and Pol ORFs fused in-frame (PGP1, PGP2, PGP3) that expressed higher amounts of Pol (Figure 3B, lane 1, 2, 5-9). Constructs with active PR domains and natural or artificial cleavage sites N-terminal of the Pol encoded sequences (PGfP1, PGP1, PGP2, PGP3) gave rise to p127Pol precursor products (Figure 3B, lane 3, 5, 7, 8).

This most likely is due to the N-terminal presence of a HIV- Gag-Pol sequence or the PFV p3Gag domain, respectively. Similar to wild type Pol these fusion proteins showed Pol precursor processing into p85PR-RTand p40IN (Figure 3B, lane 7, 9, 11, 12). For the PGP4 construct, containing only the natural Pol PR-RT/IN cleavage site, p40IN was observed at levels comparable to the other fusion proteins but no p85PR-RT was detectable (Figure 3B, lane 9).

GfP1 derived supernatant showed wild type level of infectivity whereas those of GP2, GP3, and GP1 were 2-, 3-, and 7-fold increased. As expected all supernatant samples of constructs with inactive PR (PP iPR, GfP1 iPR, GP1 iPR) were non-infectious. Cotransfection of an identical amount of the wild type p71Gag expression packaging construct led to a 2- to 5-fold decrease of infectivity in wild type (wt), GfP1, GP1 and GP2 samples. No change was observed for GP3 or PR inactive supernatants (PP iPR, GfP1 iPR, GP1 iPR) (Figure 3H, light grey bars). In contrast, the non-infectious GP4 construct was partially rescued by wild type Gag coexpression to levels of about 25% of the corresponding wild type sample (wt). Cotransfection of an identical amount of wild type p127Pol expressing packaging construct resulted in no or only minor changes of infectivities in wild type (wt), GP1, GP2, and GP3 samples (Figure 3H, dark grey bars). The GfP1 sample was the only one where wild type p127Pol coexpression led to a 7-fold increase in supernatant infectivity. Infectivity of non-infectious samples generated by cotransfection of separate wild type Gag and Pol iPR expression vectors (PG + PP iPR) could be rescued to 50% levels of the respective wild type control (PG + PP). In contrast, GfP1 iPR and GP1 iPR samples were complemented by wild type p127Pol coexpression to a much lower extent if at all. This suggests that GP4 has a defect in Gag domains that can be partially rescued by wild type Gag. Furthermore, the Gag-Pol precursor fusion proteins with inactive PR domain seem to exert dominant-negative effects on wild type particle infectivity.",

In control particle lysates from cells transfected only with a PFV Pol expression construct the p127Pol precursor protein was detectable, which was pelletable like intact PFV particles through 20% sucrose. However, this pelletable PFV p127Pol seemed not to be enveloped by a lipid membrane, because it was sensitive to digestion by subtilisin, a non-membrane permeable endoprotease. Similarly, large amounts of predominantly subtilisin-sensitive p127Pol precursor were detectable in partially purified PFV wild type virions from different sources, as reported previously [13,16,20,21]. In contrast, the mature p85PR-RTand p40IN subunits in the same samples were mainly protected against subtilisin digestion. Furthermore, the amounts of Gag and Env processing products as well as p85PR-RTand p40IN subunits, but not of p127Pol precursor correlated with viral infectivity in fractions of linear velocity sedimentation gradient centrifugation runs that were used to further purify PFV particles. Together this strongly suggests that the majority of p127Pol precursor detectable in the supernatant of PFV infected cells is not particle-associated.",

Interestingly, only non-particle-associated p127Pol was detectable in supernatant pellets from cells expressing PFV Pol alone, although intracellularly p85PR-RTand p40IN cleavage products were observed. One explanation for this might be the failure of potentially co-released mature Pol subunits or mature Pol subunits derived from secreted p127Pol precursor protein to be pelleted through 20% sucrose. Alternatively, indeed only the p127Pol precursor is released, and its further processing is prevented. Potential reasons for such a processing defect could be a misfolding of the released p127Pol precursor resulting in a lack of PFV Pol proteolytic activity mediated by oligomerization through the IN domain as recently proposed [29], a lack of essential cofactors (e.g. the recently described regulatory PARM viral genomic sequence element [18]), or a direct inhibition of PFV PR activity by factors of the extracellular environment. However, the observation that non-particle-associated, pelletable PFV Pol retains its RT activity [[16], and data not shown] at least seems to exclude a gross misfolding of the protein destroying all its enzymatic functions.",

            "text": "The characterization and analysis of expression constructs for different PFV Gag-Pol fusion proteins in this study revealed several interesting features of PFV. First, we demonstrate that PFV Pol expression in an orthoretroviral-like Gag-Pol fusion manner, even exclusively as in-frame Gag-Pol fusion, is compatible with PFV replication, which is true as long as proteolytic processing between Gag and Pol domains is possible. This is different to orthoretroviruses. Here in-frame Gag-Pol fusion expression in the absence of Gag coexpression is incompatible with viral replication [4,5,7,8]. In case of murine leukemia virus (MLV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) in-frame Gag-Pol fusions abolish precursor processing, virion assembly and particle release [4,5]. On the contrary, spleen necrosis virus (SNV) and HIV-1 in-frame Gag-Pol fusion expression results in normal or enhanced structural protein expression associated with the failure to assemble and release infectious virions [7,8]. Thus PFV tolerates a much larger variation in the Gag to Pol ratio as orthoretroviruses do and processing by the viral PR is not abolished in a Gag-Pol fusion protein context. This might be a result of the unique PFV Pol packaging strategy with viral genomic RNA serving as a bridge between both components during capsid assembly, which might be a limiting factor determining the level of Pol incorporation. In line with this is the observation that all in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusions, similar as reported for analogous orthoretroviral constructs [4,5,7,8], led to higher relative cellular Pol expression in comparison to authentic PFV Pol translation from a separately spliced RNA. However, the levels of particle-associated mature p85PR-RTand p40IN of a full-length, cleavable in-frame PFV Gag-Pol expression (PGP1) were comparable to wild type and this correlated with infectivity. In contrast, ribosomal-frameshift mediated expression of PFV Gag-Pol resulted in lower cellular Pol levels compared to wild type. The infectivity of particles derived from HIV-1 frameshift site mediated Gag-Pol expression (GfP1) was reduced 5-fold and was reflected by reduced Pol particle incorporation and Gag precursor processing. Thus an optimal particle-associated PFV Gag to Pol ratio is important for maximal virion infectivity and might be regulated in part by interaction of PFV Pol with the viral RNA during capsid incorporation. Therefore increased cellular Pol precursor levels are not detrimental for PFV particle morphogenesis.",

The in-frame GP2 and GP3 mutants displayed a similar Pol incorporation as GP1 but infectivity was reduced 30- and 160-fold respectively. This can be best explained by the failure of both mutants to generate p71Gag in addition to p68Gag. In the case of GP2, the p3Gag domain is fused to the N-terminus of Pol and cannot be removed due to the absence of a PFV PR cleavage site whereas the GP3 construct has the p3Gag coding sequence removed. Therefore, both constructs lead only to p68Gag expression after fusion protein processing. It has been demonstrated previously that PFV particles composed exclusively of p68Gag display a 100-fold reduced infectivity although particle release and morphology are indistinguishable from wild type [30,31]. The infectivity levels of GP2 and GP3 are in a similar range as reported for PFV particles solely composed of p68Gag. Interestingly, a proviral construct similar to GP3 has been described previously by L\u00f6chelt et al. when elucidating the Pol biosynthesis mechanism [27]. Similar to our results they reported a 100-fold reduced infectivity of PFV Gag-Pol in frame fusion within the p3Gag coding regions. However, although the authors observed Gag-Pol fusion protein processing, Pol subunit processing was severely impaired. This is different to the phenotype of GP3. The reason for this is currently unclear.",

The only difference between GP4 and GP3 is the absence of a functional p68Gag/p3Gag cleavage site between the fused Gag and Pol ORFs. Therefore GP4 only contains the natural Pol PR-RT/IN processing site. This leads to fusion protein processing into mature p68Gag-p85PR-RTand p40IN subunits, indicating that also PFV PR is still active with a large N-terminal protein fusion. However, neither the GP4 precursor nor the mature subunits are able to support release of infectious PFV virions. This is demonstrated by the absence of significant amounts of subtilisin resistant structural proteins in respective particle preparations and the failure to detect normal capsid structures upon ultrastructural analysis of cells expressing GP4. Interestingly, coexpression of wild type Gag but not Pol resulted in a partial rescue of viral infectivity. In this setting the essential viral enzymatic functions are provided by the GP4 protein. Therefore, this suggests that coexpressed wild type Gag and GP4 can interact, probably through their Gag domains, and generate particles that retain some infectivity. Thus GP4 seems to have a defect in capsid assembly involving its Gag domains presumably due to C-terminal addition of the large p85PR-RTPol domain.",

In contrast, GP1 iPR failed to support capsid assembly and release of significant amounts of subtilisin resistant capsids.

            "text": "A schematic outline of the constructs used in this study is shown in Figure 2. In the enlargement of the Gag-Pol ORF overlap/fusion of the individual constructs the amino-acid sequence is given. All constructs are based on authentic, non-codon-optimized PFV ORFs. The 4-component PFV vector system consisting of the PFV Gag expression vector pcziPG4 (PG), the PFV Pol expression vector pcziPol (PP), the PFV Env expression construct pczHFVenvEM002 (PE), and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressing PFV transfer vector pMD9 (PV), has been described previously [28]. In this study a variant transfer vector puc2MD9 [35] and modified PFV Gag (p6iGag4) and PFV Pol (p6iPol2) expression constructs were used, all containing a pUC19 backbone instead of the original pcDNA3.1 zeo backbone. Expression vectors for PFV Gag-Pol fusion proteins all based on the p6iGag4 construct were generated by removing the start methionine in PFV Pol and fusing the PFV Pol-ORF in-frame to the PFV Gag-ORF at different positions resulting in constructs GP1, GfP1, GP2, GP3 and GP4 as illustrated in Figure 2. In addition, the authentic Pol translation initiation codon in the 3' part of the Gag ORF naturally overlapping with the PFV Pol ORF had been inactivated without changing the Gag protein sequence. Further modifications of the individual constructs are the insertion of a second p68/p3 proteolytic cleavage site between the PFV Gag- and Pol-ORF fusion in GP1 and GfP1. GfP1 harbors in addition a minimal HIV-1 Gag-Pol frameshift element containing an HIV-1 NC/p1 PR cleavage site [36]. In GP2, PFV Gag and Pol ORFs are fused in-frame without any additional sequences. GP3 has most of the PFV Gag p3 domain removed leaving the natural p68/p3 cleavage site intact whereas in GP4 the PFV Gag p3 domain was completely removed by fusing PFV Pol to p68Gag coding sequences. For some experiments, expression vectors for Gag-Pol fusion proteins with a catalytically inactive PR (GP1iPR and GfP1iPR) containing a Pol D24A mutation [23,37] were used as indicated. The amino acid sequences in single letter code of the Gag-Pol fusion regions of the different mutants, starting with the non-altered aa position PFV Gag G613 and terminating with PFV Pol L9, are shown in Figure 2. Expression constructs for the Gag-Pol fusion proteins were generated by standard PCR cloning techniques and were verified by sequencing analysis. Further details on the cloning procedures and mutagenesis primers used are available upon request. The different PFV proviral Gag-Pol fusion constructs depicted were generated by replacing a 1829 bp SwaI/PacI fragment of the infectious molecular clone pczHSVR2 [38] with the corresponding fragment of eukaryotic constructs expressing only the mutant Gag-Pol fusion proteins. Proviral constructs are labeled with the prefix \"P\" (e.g. PGP-1) that is omitted in Gag/Pol packaging constructs of the replication-deficient 4-component PFV vector system (e.g. GP-1).",

Cell lysates (cell, lane 1-10, 1/25 of total) as well as viral particle preparations (virus, lane 11-29, 10 ml supernatant equivalents), concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose and either digested with subtilisin (+) or mock incubated (-) prior to lysis, were analyzed by Western blot. Antibodies or antisera used were specific for A) PFV Gag (\u03b1-Gag), B) PFV p85PR-RT and PFV p40IN (\u03b1-RT + \u03b1-IN), C) PFV Env SU (\u03b1-SU), D) PFV Env LP (\u03b1-LP) E) PFV Bet (\u03b1-Bet), F) rabbit GAPDH (\u03b1-GAPDH). The identity of the individual proteins is indicated in the middle, the molecular weight of the protein standard on both sides. 293T cells were transfected with: pczHSRV2 wt (lane 1, 11, 12; wt); pczHSRV2 iPR (lane 2, 13, 14; iPR); pczHSRV2 PGfP1 (lane 3, 15, 16; PGfP1); pczHSRV2 PGfP1 iPR (lane 4, 17, 18; PGfP1 iPR); pczHSRV2 PGP1 (lane 5, 19, 20; PGP1); pczHSRV2 PGP1 iPR (lane 6, 21, 22; PGP1 iPR); pczHSRV2 PGP2 (lane 7, 23, 24; PGP2); pczHSRV2 PGP3 (lane 8, 25, 26; PGP3); pczHSRV2 PGP4 (lane 9, 27, 28; PGP4); pcDNA3.1+zeo (lane 10, 29; mock). G) Relative titers of the individual 293T supernatants on BHK/LTR(PFV)lacZ cells. Means and standard deviations (n = 4) are shown. H) Relative infectivity of extracellular culture supernatants of 293T cells transfected with Gag/Pol packaging constructs in context of the replication-deficient 4-component PFV vector system using an eGFP marker gene transfer assay determined 3 days post infection. Means and standard deviations (n = 4-8) are shown. Identical amounts of Gag, Pol and Gag-Pol fusion protein packaging constructs were used. In case of the Gag-Pol fusion protein packaging constructs the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1zeo vector.
