ALV-J has caused enormous losses to the world poultry industry at the end of the last century [1]. The prevention and control of ALV-J is mainly through eliminating infected chickens due to lacking effective vaccines and drugs. The western world has been successful in the eradication of ALV-J from the breeding flocks. However, the ALV purification of chicken flocks is a big project that requires a lot of manpower, materials and technology. Especially in developing countries like China, where farms lack management experience and sufficient funds, coupled with the existence of numerous local chicken breeds, ALV purification is a challenge. Therefore, it is important to change the individual\u2019s resistance to ALV-J from the nature of the genetics, although it is difficult. The screening and identification of anti-ALV-J genes is an important strategy in the genetic improvement of chickens. However, to our knowledge, the systematic identification of anti-ALV-J genes has not been reported.",

Previously, it has been reported that CH25H broadly inhibited viral entry by production of 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC) [8]. As a soluble oxysterol, 25HC could inhibit viral entry by blocking membrane fusion between the cell and virus [8]. In addition, 25HC also acts as an amplifier of inflammation via AP-1 and that the resulting alteration in inflammatory response leads to increased tissue damage in mice following influenza infection [9], and acts as a modulator for both innate and adaptive immune responses toward inhibiting simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection [10].",

As an enzyme, CH25H catalyzes the cholesterol to form a soluble factor, 25HC [35]. Recent studies have showed that CH25H is broadly antiviral by producing 25HC to fight against several viruses such as mammalian reovirus [21], zika virus [17], hepatitis C virus [36], lassa virus [37] and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [38]. The mechanism of antiviral function for 25HC is not completely understood. For enveloped viruses, 25HC suppressed viral replication by blocking membrane fusion between cells and viruses [8]. Whether chCH25H inhibit the replication of the notorious chicken retrovirus ALV-J or not? In our latest study, we found that overexpression of chCH25H in chicken primary macrophage could restrict ALV-J infection [39]. However, we did not explore the mechanism of CH25H against ALV-J infection in chicken macrophages.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that chIFN-\u03b1 and ALV-J induced expression of chCH25H in chicken PBMC and DF1 cells (Figure 2). Thus, chCH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene in chicken. ISGs activation followed the binding of transcriptional complex and ISRE or GAS [40]. Of the hundreds of known ISGs in other species, some have only ISRE or only GAS elements in their upstream regions, whereas others have both elements [40]. In general, type I and type II IFNs induced the transcription of genes that have ISRE and GAS elements in their promoter, respectively [40]. However, upstream regions of chCH25H analysis showed that 8 GAS were located in these regions, but no ISRE (Figure 4C). Our result suggested that chCH25H not only can be induced by IFN-\u03b1, but also might be induced by IFN-\u03b3. The upstream unknown region of the chCH25H still needs to be identified, with the hope to find ISRE elements in those regions.",

Previous studies have found that administration of 25HC could inhibit HIV-1 and Zika virus infection in animal models [8,17]. These results suggested that CH25H played an important physiologic role in antiviral defense. Given that no vaccine for ALV-J is currently available, chCH25H can be used as a new strategy to control ALV-J. 25HC could potentially be used as an anti-ALV-J therapeutic as it has in vitro activity against ALV-J. Although the antiviral mechanism of 25HC through affecting viral and cell membrane fusion has been widely found, other new antiviral mechanisms still need to be determined. However, the antiviral activity of 25HC against a number of viruses still highlights this oxysterol as a potential target for antiviral therapy. The further study on the underlying immunological mechanism of chCH25H and 25-HC in inhibiting ALV-J infection should be illuminated. Furthermore, transgenic chickens with overexpression of chCH25H in vivo deserve further research. These CH25H-transgenic chickens may have a broad-spectrum antiviral property.",
