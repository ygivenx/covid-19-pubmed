            "text": "Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for the attachment and fusion of the virus to the target membrane. Mature HA is composed of HA1 (attachment) and HA2 (fusion) subunits connected by a disulfide linkage. HA2 can be divided into the fusion peptide (FP) domain, the heptad repeat (HR) regions, transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytoplasmic tail (CT). The functional roles of FP and HR domains have been demonstrated rather clearly [1-4]: the hydrophobic FP domain is sequestered in the resting state but exposed and inserted into the target membrane on low pH activation; the HR domain undergoes extensive refolding to form the hairpin structure to bring the two membranes proximal and probably provides free energy to overcome the barrier of membrane merger. A previous study by Lai et al. [5] revealed that the functional fusion peptide of influenza virus had a kinked helix structure with a fixed angle in the micellar environment. However, the role played by TMD remains controversial except for the recognition that it anchors the fusion protein on the viral membrane and is involved in the late stages of the fusion process. As evidence for the latter proposition, cells expressing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ectodomain of HA have been shown to support hemifusion to target membranes at low pH [6], implying a TMD role in transiting membrane hemifusion to full fusion. The result was corroborated by a stringent TMD length requirement for supporting full membrane fusion [7], strongly suggesting that it is necessary for TMD to span both inner and outer leaflets to fulfill its function of driving complete fusion via hemifusion. On the other hand, a mutational study of the HIV-1 TMD demonstrated that substitution of one specific residue in TMD did not alter the fusion protein function, whereas replacement of TMD with that of CD4 [8] or of vesicular stomatitis virus G [9] abolished the viral fusion activity without affecting transport and cleavage properties.",

They suggested that TMD had a role at the late stages of membrane fusion, including dehydration of water at the apposing membrane surfaces. Melikyan et al. [11] have shown that substitution of the TMD of HA (Japan) with TMD from other unrelated proteins does not affect membrane fusion.

In addition, to clarify the architecture of TMD in the membrane in complex with FP, we conducted biophysical experiments on the peptides derived from HA2 TMD and FP in a model membrane. Owing to the potentially weak interaction between TMD and FP in the membranous environment, fluorescence spectrophotometry was employed which is most suitable for long-range (>10 \u00c5) interactions in lieu of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements that are sensitive to short-range association (<5 \u00c5). We found that TMD self-associated more tightly than FP in the membrane. The two peptide molecules form a loose complex in an antiparallel manner, with TMD oligomers interspersed with FP molecules and modulation of lipid penetration of FP by interacting with TMD.",

A shift of emission maximum from 345 to 337 nm and the enhancement of emission as the peptide in aqueous buffer was added to the vesicular dispersion indicate the immersion of the TMD peptide in the lipid bilayer. Insertion into the membrane is ascertained by a marked decrease in KSV, from 20.9 to 10.6 at pH 5.0 and from 26.8 to 14.9 at pH 7.4, for TMD in association with vesicles. The smaller KSV value, 10.6, compared with 14.9 at pH 7.4 coupled with the difference in the ratio of KSV in the two pH tested suggests that the insertion of the peptide is deeper at acidic than neutral pH.",

            "text": "We have probed the self-assembly of influenza HA2 FP in the membrane and found a loose association for the FP molecules [16]. In the present study, the dependence of Rhodamine (Rho) self-quenching on the composition of the fluorescence label was used to probe the self-association of TMD (Figure 2A) and TMD-FP association (Figure 2B). In Figure 2A, the following two observations are noteworthy for both acidic and neutral pH: first, the flatness of the normalized intensity in the x = 1\u20130.3 range (which reflects mainly short-range intra-subunit interaction), compared with HA2 FP [16] (where x denotes the fraction of labeled peptide), suggests a very tight TMD association; second, in the low x (<0.3) regime (which emphasizes long-range inter-subunit interaction) a much smaller increase in the normalized intensity than the case of FP also corroborates the idea of tight self-binding for HA2 TMD molecules. This conclusion is further supported by the association between FP and TMD described in the next section. Another line of evidence for tighter self-association of TMD is provided by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) measurements (Figure 2C). The multiple oligomeric species of TMD at low pH is in marked contrast with the single monomer band for FP, demonstrating higher propensity of self-association for TMD. Moreover, the pattern for the mixture of TMD and FP is the combination of the individual TMD and FP bands, indicating that the interaction between the two peptides cannot sustain the dispersing force exerted by the SDS detergent and the underlying electric field. The data are in line with the idea of weak interaction between TMD and FP, as is further elaborated in the following sections. Oligomerization of TMD has been documented by Tatulian and Tamm [10].",

For both pH levels tested, the normalized intensity of the Rho dye labeled to TMD or FP of HA2 increases on mixing with their counterparts, while no change is observed when FP of human immunodeficiency virus is added to the TMD-containing solution. This result clearly indicates that the interaction between TMD and FP is not random. We also found that the intensity enhancement is less pronounced for the labeled TMD than the labeled FP when the TMD:FP complex is formed, indicating that self-packing of TMD is tighter and TMD likely forms the inner core in the complex. The difference is easily detected in top and middle panels of Figure 2B for pH 7.4 in which Rho-TMD experiences less dequenching than Rho-FP at the same x value; also, at smaller x, Rho-FP shows a larger increase suggesting a dispersed FP subunit by complexing to TMD (i.e. reduced intra-subunit association), supporting the concept of an inner TMD core for the TMD:FP complex which is more directly shown in the next section.",

In the experiments, the fluorescence intensity as a percentage of that in the presence of triton X-100 (for complete dequenching) is used as a gage for aggregation, with smaller values representing tighter association. As summarized in Table 1, a substantial increase in Rho-labeled FP at low pH upon addition of TMD suggests association of these two peptides. This indicates that, at pH 5.0, FP molecules self-assemble with considerable strength, but are broken up upon incubating with TMD in the bilayer. (At neutral pH, dequenching of Rho-FP by TMD addition is not as pronounced owing to a rather loose self-assembly.) It is likely that FP monomers are wrapped on the exterior of the TMD oligomer, as deduced from the markedly smaller intensity of Rho labeled to TMD than that labeled to FP. Alternatively, the loosely associated FP oligomers, as evidenced by much larger Rho-FP dequenching than that of TMD displayed in Table 1, may distribute around the tight-packed TMD. Either interpretation is in line with the previous conclusion of weak self-association of HA2-FP in the membrane [16]. A negative control is provided by the self-quenching data on mixing of HA2 TMD and gp41 FP of HIV-1 (which also forms a loose self-assembly as shown in Table 1 and by Kliger et al. [17]); no detectable change in the extent of quenching is observed compared with gp41 FP alone (Table 1).",

On the other hand, HA2 FP has been found to insert obliquely into the membrane. Hence, it is of interest to examine the effect of TMD:FP formation on the membrane insertion depth and angle of FP. As illustrated in Figure 5, KSV of cobalt quenching of NBD labeled at the N-terminus of FP decreases with the introduction of TMD. In stark contrast, KSV increases upon complexing to TMD for NBD labeled at the C-terminus of FP. The effect of adding TMD on KSV is the same for pH 5.0 and 7.4. The data strongly suggest that the N-terminal portion of FP penetrates deeper while the C-terminus shallower as the TMD:FP complex forms in the membrane. Importantly, as discussed in the following, the alteration of the insertion depth of the N- and C-termini of FP upon complex formation leads to the idea that FP aligned more parallel to TMD with its N-terminus close to the C-terminus of TMD. The finding may have a bearing on the role of TMD in promoting membrane hemifusion to complete fusion transition, as is elaborated in the Discussion. Compatible with the previous results [18], insertion of FP is deeper at acidic pH.",

The secondary structure and orientation of TMD, FP and TMD:FP are summarized in Table 2. Helix accounted for 64% of the secondary structure for TMD, in qualitative agreement with the values obtained by Tatulian and Tamm [10]. No significant change in helix content was observed for TMD:FP complex, whose helicity is approximately an average of that of TMD and FP. The insertion angle for TMD was found to be 34\u00b0 with respect to the normal of the membrane, slightly larger than the value reported by Tatulian and Tamm [10]. Similar to the helix content, the insertion angle of TMD:FP helix is an average of that of TMD and FP. We also note in Figure 7 that the extent of dehydration is greater for FP than TMD. Moreover, the membrane perturbation probed by the change in lipid acyl chain orientation caused by FP and by TMD (Table 2) revealed that FP has a greater effect than TMD. The lesser membrane-perturbing effect of TMD than FP seen here is compatible with the results of leakage experiments (Figure 6). The smaller insertion angle for TMD than that for FP and less dehydration of TMD may be correlated with its smaller perturbation on the membrane acyl chain orientation. Importantly, as shown in the inset of Figure 7, the dehydration caused by TMD:FP is more pronounced than FP and TMD individually, indicating a synergetic membrane-perturbing effect of the formation of TMD:FP complex suggesting a role of TMD and FP association in destabilizing the fusing membranes.",

Here we show in Table 1 that TMD molecules form tightly packed oligomeric subunits in the membrane which are tighter than FP as deduced from the greater Rhodamine self-quenching for TMD. No discernible dequenching is observed for Rhodamine-labeled TMD as FP is added, while Rhodamine conjugated to FP has enhanced dequenching with TMD incorporation. This suggests that tight TMD packing is intact upon interacting with FP whereas inter-FP distance becomes longer for loosely aggregated FP monomers when attracted by tightly associated TMD oligomers nearby. Another line of evidence for a more stable oligomer formed by TMD can be visualized in Figure 2C, in which only the monomeric FP band is displayed. More indirect evidence for tighter association of TMD than FP and that TMD constitutes the inner core of the TMD:FP complex can be deduced from Figure 2B. The association between the two kinds of molecules is further affirmed by the FRET results shown in Figure 3 indicating larger transfer efficiency than random distribution of the two peptides from NBD to Rhodamine conjugated, respectively, to TMD and FP at the opposite ends. The orientation between TMD and FP can be resolved by FRET experiments in which pyrene (donor) and NBD (acceptor) were labeled to TMD and FP at either N- or C-terminus (Figure 4).

After all, TMD serves as an anchor for the viral fusion protein and therefore should not induce membrane permeation and death of the virus.",

As membrane dehydration represents a major barrier to fusion, this result suggests that association of the two HA2 domains, primarily by perturbing the membrane bilayer at the fusing site, promotes membrane merger mediated by the influenza hemagglutinin.",

            "text": "As elaborated above, it is possible that the TMD oligomers are surrounded by FP on the external surface or loosely associated FP molecules disperse around TMD homo-oligomers. It has been shown that the polar segment immediately following FP of HIV-1 gp41 is conformationally plastic [12,20] and that the tryptophan-rich pre-TM stretch possesses membrane activity [21]. Given the involvement of TMD in the hemifusion-to-complete fusion transition and the stringent length requirement for this function [7] we propose a working model for the late steps of HA-mediated fusion (Figure 8). At the pre-hairpin stage, FP inserts into the target membrane; trimerization is mainly mediated through self-association of the HR1 region while HR2 domain is somewhat unordered. Perhaps owing to the flexibility and membrane activity of the FP-proximal region and the membrane-perturbing pre-TM region [22], refolding of the pre-hairpin structure occurs when HA is exposed to acidic pH, pulling the two apposing membranes close. In the membrane interior, FP and TMD move towards each other in antiparallel orientation to form a loose complex, with self-assembled TMD surrounded by FP or interspersed with FP in a somewhat straggling manner, in view of the report that fusion activity is retained with the TMD segment replaced by TMD from other membrane proteins [8,9]. In addition to deepening the FP penetration into the lipid bilayer and further deforming the membrane at the fusing site, the loose interaction between TMD and FP may foster clustering of neighboring FP and the associated TMD molecules, a necessary step for the fusion pore formation and enlargement. We propose that the latter process constitutes a major step for FP and TMD to exert their function. Concomitantly, HR1 and HR2 of the ectodomain form a helix hairpin bundle in the space between the apposing membranes. The free energy released from the rearrangement and conformational change enables the fusion protein and viral and target membranes to surmount the barrier of membrane dehydration and deformation (destabilization) required for membrane coalescence [23]. In other words, the synergetic membrane-perturbing effect (Figure 7) and the deepening membrane penetration of FP resulting from complexing to TMD (Figure 5), in combination with TMD traversing both leaflets of bilayer, eventually cause the rupture of the inner leaflets of both attending membranes resulting in full fusion by the cooperative FP:TMD cluster recruited to the fusion site.",

Perhaps the role of TMD in the membrane fusion is twofold: first, mechanically it anchors the fusion protein onto the viral membrane and secures the oligomerization of the fusion protein through its tight self-association, and importantly, it does not destabilize the membrane in the absence of FP; second, it has a weak interaction with FP, thereby reinforcing the destabilizing effect of FP on the inner leaflet of the target membrane by deepening FP membrane insertion (Figure 7). This latter effect is manifested by the requirement of TMD length for different phenotypes of fusion, hemifusion and full-fusion activity [7], because spanning both leaflets of the bilayer for TMD is conceivably a prerequisite for TMD to execute this function. The differential results on the effect of altering the basic residue in the middle of the HIV-1 TMD sequence [9,24] may be related to the weak association between TMD and FP deduced herein (Figure 2C). The concept that the role of TMD in the fusion process lies more in disrupting the inner leaflet of the fusing membranes than the specific interaction with FP is consistent with the inability of a GPI-anchored HA ectodomain to mediate full fusion [6].",

(2) Low pH-induced refolding of HR1 and HR2 regions of the HA2 driven by strong interactions between them. The two apposing membranes are pulled in proximity and bulged-out to facilitate the merge. (3) Driven by the energy liberated by HR1-HR2 association and additional force provided by the polar, conformationally plastic linker segment downstream of FP and the membranetropic pre-TM region, the two fusing membranes undergo dehydration, deformation and coalescence of the outer leaflets, causing hemifusion. In the process, the compact TMD homo-trimer approaches the loose FP aggregate and may be interspersed with FP molecules, gradually forming the TMD-FP complex, which is not specific per se, with TMD in the inner core. Nonetheless, the interaction is sufficiently strong to align FP with TMD to a certain extent and deepen FP penetration into the inner leaflet, further destabilizing the bilayer. (4) Partly as a result of the complex formation-enhanced perturbation of both leaflets of the effector and target membranes, the hemifusion diaphragm transits to an inceptive fusion pore, concomitant with the six-helix bundle formation of HR1 and HR2. By this stage, the recruitment of adjacent TMD:FP triplex subunits cooperatively stabilizes the initial pore and its dilation to facilitate the mixing of cytoplasmic contents.",
