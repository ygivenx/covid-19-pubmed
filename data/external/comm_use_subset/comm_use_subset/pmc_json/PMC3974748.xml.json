In the northeastern USA, the Delaware Bay area is crucial for the annual migration of shorebird and gull species that feed on the horseshoe crab eggs found in abundance thanks to the coinciding spawning season (for review see [3]). Avian influenza virus isolation rates from shorebirds and gulls during spring migration are significantly higher in this area than in other surveillance sites [3], [4], [5]. This observation prompted us to assess the ability to detect other, novel viruses in shorebirds during the spring migration.",

Samples from eight individual birds, that included semipalmated sandpipers, sanderlings and ruddy turnstones, were extracted for total RNA, reverse transcribed and amplified by random PCR before the purified PCR products were pooled and processed for sequencing on the 454 pyrosequencing platform. Sequencing yielded 182,358 reads with a mean length of 320 nt (NIH Short Read Archive accession number SRP035900). After filtering for ribosomal and host sequences, the remaining 4171 sequences were processed to assemble possible contiguous sequences and then analyzed at nt and deduced aa level. Three sequences of 357, 468 and 474 nt length showed homology to members of the coronavirus (CoV) family and two sequences of 436 and 445 nt showed homology to avian astroviruses (AstV). In addition we detected reads with distant homology to tetnoviruses (2 reads) and marnavirus (1 read); viruses of insects and algae, respectively, that were in view of the limited sample material not further followed. No other sequences with significant homology to viral records in GenBank (release 175) were detected using an e-value cut-off of 0.001 for Blastn and Fastx.",

The family Astroviridae is divided into mammalian and avian AstVs (\nFigure 1\n) ([11], [12], http://www.iah-virus.org/astroviridae/avastrovirus). In addition to yet unassigned chicken AstVs, a novel wood pigeon AstV and feral pigeon AstVs were recently identified in Norway that appear to be highly divergent from ANV-1, their closest relative [13]. To gain further insight into the evolutionary relationship to other AstVs, a phylogenetic analysis of sanderling AstV was conducted based on a common 198 aa ORF1a sequence aligned to representative members of the family. The analysis indicated that sanderling AstV formed together with ANV-like AstV a branch distinct from other avian AstVs, namely those of duck, chicken and turkey origin (\nFigure 1\n). Because sequence information of ORF1a is only available for ANV-1 and pigeon ANV but not for the novel pigeon AstVs reported from Norway, we cannot determine whether sanderling AstV groups with the subgroup of pigeon AstVs suggested by Kofstad and Jonassen [13]. Attempts to obtain additional sequence flanking the 600 bp region failed. This may reflect compromised nucleic acid quality in the sample material in addition to possible primer failure due to high sequence divergence.",

The discovery of pigeon ANV that is related to chicken ANV supports the likelihood of cross-infection between pigeons and chicken [21], [22]. Additional evidence for interspecies transmission among avian AstVs was provided by the identification of guinea fowl AstV, that is related to turkey AstV type 2 [23], and the subsequent experimental infections conducted with both viruses in both avian species [24].

Members of the family Coronaviridae cause enteric, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) diseases in a wide range of animal species [26], [27]. The subfamily Coronavirinae has been divided into four groups (\nFigure 2\n). Recent studies have revealed the presence of diverse, novel gamma and delta-CoVs in wild birds from Hong Kong [25], [28], Cambodia [28] and from the Bering Strait area [29]. Since full-length genomic sequences are not available for all of them, we assessed the relationship between those CoVs and ruddy turnstone CoV by amplifying a fragment of the polymerase (pol) gene with degenerate primers described by Muradrasoli et al. [29]. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplified 508 nt pol sequence (GenBank accession number JX548304) agreed with that of the partial spike, ORF1ab and 3\u2032end (NS7c-like) sequences and showed a relation to the delta-CoV clade (\nFigure 2\n). The pol sequence of ruddy turnstone CoV shares approx. 86% aa identity with common-moorhen CoV HKU21 from Hong Kong [25], and is less related to the IBV-like viruses from the Bering Strait area that fall into the gamma-CoV cluster. As with Sanderling AstV, attempts to obtain additional sequences from ruddy turnstone CoV were unsuccessful.",

The CoV sequences reported here along with recent discoveries by others [28], [29] imply a vast diversity among circulating avian CoVs and a high prevalence in wild birds [28]. Finally, the Delaware Bay area could serve as a useful surveillance site for such novel avian viruses, in addition to influenza viruses. Due to the high volume of birds feeding during migration periods, the area may provide a niche for the emergence and spread of novel virus variants.",
