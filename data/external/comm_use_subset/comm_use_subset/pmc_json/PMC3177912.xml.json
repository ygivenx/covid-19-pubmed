            "text": "The natural reservoir of influenza A virus (infAv) is considered to be aquatic birds because all known subtypes (H1-H16 and N1-N9) of infAv have been isolated from waterfowl [1]. InfAv can, however, infect many other mammalian species, including humans, swine, horses, ferrets, and sea mammals [1-3]. There are several specific swine influenza A virus (SIV) subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2) circulating in the pig populations in Europe, including Denmark [4-6]. The Danish SIV subtype H1N2 differs from the European SIV H1N2 subtypes, in that it is a re-assortment between two circulating Danish SIV strains of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. The first known Danish H1N2 isolate occurred in 2003 and is therefore a relatively new strain in Denmark [7].",

            "text": "It has been described that pigs have receptors for both human and avian strains of influenza A viruses in the upper respiratory tract and therefore are susceptible to infections by both [8,9]. Based on this finding, it has been proposed that pigs can act as a mixing vessel when infected by both a human and avian influenza A virus (AIV) strain to make a new reassorted virus with zoonotic and even pandemic potential. In recent years, however, there have been examples of infAv crossing the species barrier without the involvement of pigs [10-12]. Infections with infAv are initiated by interactions between virus haemagglutinin and sialic acid (SA) molecules on target cells. AIV strains prefer SA-\u03b1-2,3-terminal saccharides whereas human and swine influenza virus strains prefer SA-\u03b1-2,6-terminal saccharides as receptors [9,13-16]. A few studies have shown that the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract of pigs express both receptors [8,9]. However, recent studies have shown a more variable distribution of the specific receptors in the deeper lung areas whereas in the trachea the SA-\u03b1-2,6-terminal saccharides are abundant [17,18]. It has been described that after infections with AIV in pigs and humans the virus has shifted receptor specificity from SA-\u03b1-2,3 to SA-\u03b1-2,6 as a part of the adaptation to the new host by the virus. This shift in receptor specificity has been linked to specific amino acid substitutions in the HA molecule [19-21], but the exact determinants of the host specificity of infAv have not been fully elucidated.",

The Sambucus Nigra (SNA) lectin is specific for SA-\u03b1-2,6 bindings and the Maackia Amurensis (MAA) lectin is specific for SA-\u03b1-2,3 bindings of the SA molecules. In order to detect SA-\u03b1-2,3-terminal saccharides it is necessary to use two isoforms of MAA lectin: MAAI and II because the two isoforms are different in the way they recognise the inner sugar structures of SA-\u03b1-2,3 [22-24]. A more thorough investigation of the receptor distribution in the respiratory tract of pigs would give a more nuanced picture of the infection dynamic of different infAv in pigs. This, together with investigation of the predilection site of different infAv in the respiratory tract tissue, would enable us to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of infection regarding pathogenesis and host range determination.",

A total of 21 pigs were included in this study of which 8 pigs were inoculated with influenza virus (4 with SIV and 4 with AIV) (in total 8 influenza virus positive pigs). Furthermore, 4 pigs were mock inoculated and one pig was not inoculated (see below). Additionally, tissue samples were included for the lectin staining from 8 pigs which had recovered from SIV (H1N1 and H1N2) infections 8 weeks earlier.

Mapping of the distribution of receptors in the respiratory tract of different infAv hosts is therefore highly relevant for clarifying host susceptibility to various infAv strains.

However, humans also possess SA-\u03b1-2,3 in the lower part of the respiratory tract and domestic birds like chicken and quail have also been shown to express both receptors [26,31-33].

Our findings are in accordance with the results of recent studies by Nelli et al. [18] and Van Poucke et al.

The findings are also in concordance with similar studies in AIV infected humans showing that it is mostly the lower areas of the lung that are infected with AIV, resulting in pneumonia [33-35].

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for the discrepancies in receptor distribution found in different studies. One obvious source of variables is the choice of lectins used for the receptor staining. Thus, Nicholls et al. [23] showed how lectins from different manufacturers may vary in specificity and sensitivity. In addition, both isoforms of MAAI and II recognise SA-\u03b1-2,3, but are different in the way they recognises the inner sugar structures. In order to detect all SA-\u03b1-2,3 receptors it is important to use both isoforms. Furthermore, since lectins are ubiquitously distributed in different tissues and constitute a component of mucus it is important to be able to differentiate respiratory epithelial cells from other lectin signal positive components in the respiratory tract. We have tried to meet these uncertainties in our scoring system by using relatively wide percentage ranges of the distribution in staining and by specifically evaluating the epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract. This allowed us to identify the non-specific staining. Furthermore, the selection of pigs for the study may also be important since the receptor distribution may be dependent on various factors such as age, infection status, pig breed etc. However, this has not been documented.",

A likely explanation could be that the infAv neuraminidases have cleaved off the sialic acids during the infection. Afterwards there could be a delay in re-establishing the receptors on infected cells or it could be a defence mechanism prompted by the host cell. To our knowledge this has not been shown earlier but is interesting because it would significantly impact the risk of a single cell being infected with different infAv subtypes and thereby reduce the risk of generating re-assorted viruses.

Low-grade infection after experimental inoculation with AIV in pigs is in agreement with other studies comparing AIV and SIV infections in pigs [45,46]. The predilection of an AIV for swine alveolar type II alveolar cells has to our knowledge not been described earlier, but alveolar type II cells have been found to be the primary cell type infected in the lungs of fatal human cases of HPAI H5N1 AIV infections [34,35,47]. This may indicate a preference of AIV for alveolar type II epithelial cells in both pigs and humans. Our study indicates that there is a predominance of SA-\u03b1-2,3-terminal saccharides on the alveolar type II epithelial cells compared to type I cells and this could explain why the avian virus is confined to alveolar type II epithelia cells. This also opens the possibility of using the pig as a model for the study of the pathogenesis of AIV infection in humans.",

The lectin staining is reduced in the influenza infected area (*). E: Lung section from avian influenza (AIV) infected pig euthanized PID 4 stained for AIV antigens (red). In the same section it is possible to identify an infected (*) and non-infected lobulus (#). F: Parallel section to E demonstrating SNA lectin staining. A reduction of lectin staining is seen in the influenza infected lobulus (*) compared to the non-infected lobulus. (Original magnifications A, B, C, and D x10).",
