            "text": "Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is the leading cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in children younger than 5 years throughout the world. The burden of these infections is particularly important in developing countries with a meta\u2010analysis estimating that 265 000 (95% CI 160 000\u2013450 000) in\u2010hospital deaths took place in 2010 with 99% of those deaths occurring in developing countries.1 Although there is little information on the causes of these respiratory illnesses in developing countries, available data indicate that viral agents play an important role globally.2 A meta\u2010analysis estimates that hRSV causes 33\u00b78 million infections each year among children younger than 5 years. About 3\u00b74 million of these cases require hospital admission, and an estimated 66 000\u2013199 000 of children die with 99% of deaths occurring in developing countries.3 Many other viruses such as influenza viruses, rhinoviruses (RV), human parainfluenza viruses (hPIV), human adenoviruses (hAdV), human coronaviruses (hCoV\u2010OC43, hCoV\u2010229E, hCoV\u2010NL63, and hCoV\u2010HKU1), and enteroviruses (EV) have also been implicated worldwide.2, 4, 5 Discovered recently, human metapneumoviruses (hMPVs) and human bocaviruses (hBoVs) are viruses resulting in similar symptoms. Other emergent viruses such as SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV are responsible for more severe symptoms like respiratory distress syndrome.6, 7, 8 Real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) assays have been shown to be a sensitive and specific tool for the detection of these viruses. Furthermore, the introduction of multiplex rRT\u2010PCR enables the set\u2010up of assays detecting two or more targets in single clinical specimen.9, 10\n",

Comparison among published studies is always difficult. Possible reasons for these varying outcomes among studies include true differences in epidemiology, differences in the inclusion criteria for study population, diagnostic methods used, panel of viral agents tested, climate, study duration, and patients' ages. Consider that all the above studies included hospitalized children; lower prevalence recorded by Khor et al. might have been due to their 27\u2010year study duration and laboratory methods (direct IF and viral isolation) which are known to be less sensitive than molecular techniques.25\n",

            "text": "As previously shown, we also found that virus\u2010associated hospitalization figures were significantly higher among children (P = 0\u00b703).27, 28, 38 According to reports, there is always a higher incidence of viral respiratory infection in children than in adults. This may be partially explained by the lower detection rate of respiratory viruses in the elderly due to reduced viral shedding in older age groups.39 HRSV, the second most commonly virus detected in this study, has been reported to be the leading cause of SARI in young children.19, 22, 36 Nevertheless, we did not find a significant age\u2010specific prevalence in HRSV detection during this study. This was probably due to the fact that our statistical analysis was hampered by the limited size of study participants older than 5 years. Headaches were negatively associated with positives samples (P = 0\u00b7003). However, as a majority of our study population was made up of children unable to report headaches, only 46 patients (13\u00b73%) were taken into account in the analysis.Multiple viral infections were observed in 29\u00b75% of the patients with positive viral detection. This is a very similar percentage to the one found by others researchers.22, 26, 37 Bocavirus has been frequently implicated in coinfections.17, 19, 25 Our results reflect those of other studies in which hBoV was associated (35\u00b78% versus 8\u00b71%, P < 0\u00b7001) with multiple infections. Surprisingly, AdV and picornaviruses were also most frequently involved in coinfections, which probably resulted from the fact that they were detected throughout the year and were among the most prevalent.",

Notwithstanding this lack of uniformity in number of samples collected during the first (September 2011 to November 2012) and second (December 2012 to September 2013) periods, we were able to detect a seasonal pattern thanks to the sufficient number of enrolled patients during two consecutive years. We found that RSV cases were detected mainly during the major rainfalls from September to November, which is consistent with the data in the literature.22, 23, 31 The seasonality of influenza virus is very uncertain in tropical areas. The current study did not confirm that influenza circulated between September and November, as shown in our previous studies.13 This fact might have contributed to the reduction in the inclusion rate during the second period due to a true change in the epidemiology of SARI. Indeed, that would have contributed to reduce the numbers eligible patients in the second period of the study. RV/EV and AdV circulated year\u2010round, a finding reported in other studies.17, 23, 28 For the remaining viruses, no evident temporal patterns were observed. This study is ongoing, however, and any changes in the seasonal circulation will be detected.",

Firstly, our study was conducted at only one site, which might have underestimated the overall detection rate for selected viruses. Likewise, the enrolled cases may not be generalizable for the entire population of children in Cameroon. Subsequently, as discussed by Broor et al.,\n38 there is no denial that some respiratory viruses can be detected in asymptomatic children24, 40, 41 or shed for long periods of time after infection.24, 42 Hence, the role played by the viruses detected in these SARI cases is less clear considering that we did not evaluate respiratory specimens from asymptomatic children without respiratory symptoms. Otherwise, despite tests for a large panel of respiratory viruses we did not evaluate bacterial etiologies, due to the difficulty in obtaining adequate samples for culture. It has been shown that bacterial pathogens may have been responsible for SARI symptoms16; further studies will thus be required to specify their role in SARI in Cameroon. Lastly, although nurses in charge of recruitment were well trained, they did not systematically record severe symptoms such as convulsion, stridor, chest pain, inability to drink or breastfeed, and outcomes of study participants. This limited our ability to assert the clinical case severity and outcome of our SARI cases. This situation also added a limitation to this study regarding the representativeness of children included.",

Using a multiplex rRT\u2010PCR, we were able to identify a wide variety of viruses and their seasonal patterns. In our resource\u2010limited setting, this process is particularly useful for selecting only the major contributors to SARI and thereby enhancing our existing surveillance systems. Additional studies evaluating asymptomatic Cameroonian children will be important to understanding the relationship between viral carriage and disease. With this new method, we will also be able to evaluate the role of viral loads in respiratory infections in future research.",
