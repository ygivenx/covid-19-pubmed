The annual influenza epidemics claim up to 500,000 lives, with children, the elderly and patients with compromised immune system being mainly affected. Moreover, intermittent influenza pandemics might have even more dramatic consequences [1\u20133]. Currently available vaccines protect only against seasonal influenza and need to be reformulated annually while antivirals are the only defense against pandemic FLUAV. Antiviral drugs targeting the viral proteins neuraminidase (NA) and M2 are available but their antiviral activity can be compromised by resistance development [4]. In particular, the use of M2 inhibitors is not recommended due to high frequency of viral resistance. Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are required to provide protection against FLUAV. Host cell proteins essential for viral spread but dispensable for survival of the cell are attractive targets for novel approaches to antiviral intervention, since their blockade might be associated with a high barrier against viral resistance [5].",

            "text": "The viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) mediates binding and entry of FLUAV into host cells and is the central target for neutralizing antibodies. The HA protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein in the constitutive secretory pathway of infected cells and depends on cleavage by host cell proteases to become active [6,7]. Cleavage-activation is essential for viral infectivity [8\u201310]. As a consequence, the responsible proteases are potential targets for antiviral intervention. It has been speculated that diverse secreted proteases can cleave and activate HA in the infected host [11]. However, recent studies demonstrate that a single membrane-associated enzyme with unknown physiological function, the serine protease TMPRSS2, cleaves and activates FLUAV in cell culture and is essential for spread of diverse FLUAV in mice [12\u201318]. Moreover, polymorphisms in tmprss2 were found to be associated with influenza severity in human patients [19], suggesting that FLUAV might also hijack TMPRSS2 for spread in the human host. However, direct proof for this hypothesis remains to be provided. Moreover, 17 TTSPs were identified in humans and several of them, including TMPRSS4 and HAT, were shown to be expressed in lung and to activate HA upon directed expression in cell culture [20\u201327]. The potential contribution of these proteases to viral spread in the host is largely unclear, although a recent study demonstrated that H3N2 viruses might be able to exploit TMPRSS4 jointly with TMPRSS2 for spread in mice [28].",

Nevertheless, infection of macaques with highly pathogenic FLUAV, the pandemic H1N1 virus of 1918 and H5N1 avian influenza viruses, induces severe disease and the macaque model has been successfully used for vaccine-, treatment- and pathogenesis-studies [31\u201333]. Based on these studies, it has been suggested that the macaque model mirrors human physiology, development of pneumonia as well as cytokine and chemokine responses more closely than other animal models (mice, ferrets) [34]. Recently, experimental inoculation of common marmosets with FLUAV has also been described [30,35]. FLUAV spread and transmission has been observed in this model and the animals developed several but not all symptoms seen in human patients [35]. Collectively, NHP are valuable models for influenza and, due to their high genetic similarity to humans, these animals may be best suited to study dependence of FLUAV on host cell factors for spread and pathogenesis. However, it is currently unknown whether the NHP orthologues of TMPRSS2 and related proteases activate FLUAV and whether serine protease activity is required for FLUAV spread in the respiratory epithelium of primates.",

The human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293T (ACC-635, Leibniz Institute DSMZ\u2013German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) cells were used for the transfection and infection experiments and were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, PAN). MDCK cells (ATCC CRL-2936, kindly provided by K. Schugart, HZI, Braunschweig) were used for the focus formation assay and were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco). All media were supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, FBS Biochrome), penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Hamburg/04/2009 (H1N1) were propagated in the chorioallantoic cavities of 10-days-old embryonated hen eggs (Valo BioMedia, Germany) for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, as previously described [36]. Viral titers were determined using the focus formation assay, which was performed exactly as previously described [22,36].",

Processing of HA by human HAT was also readily detectable but the macaque orthologues of this enzyme showed reduced HA cleavage (Fig 2A), despite their increased expression relative to the human enzyme. Finally, it is noteworthy that TMPRSS4/HAT and trypsin produced identical HA1 bands while the HA1 fragments generated by TMPRSS2 and trypsin differed in molecular weight (Fig 2A).

For this, we employed PCLS of NHP origin. Immunohistochemistry conducted with an antibody raised against human TMPRSS2 but cross-reactive with the macaque orthologues revealed that TMPRSS2 (brown color) was robustly expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells and subepithelial alveolar macrophages (Fig 3A). Camostat is a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 [40] and afforded the opportunity to investigate whether FLUAV spread in human and non-human primate PCLS depends on serine protease activity. FLUAV spread in PCLS of human and NHP origin was generally efficient and susceptible to inhibition by camostat in the absence of cytotoxic effects (Fig 3B), as determined by Cytotoxicity Detection Kit PLUS LDH (not shown). However, subtle differences in the efficiency of FLUAV inhibition by camostat were noted. Thus, blockade of viral spread in common marmoset PCLS was most efficient, with 1 \u03bcM camostat reducing FLUAV spread to background levels, while this concentration of inhibitor had only modest inhibitory effects in PCLS of human and cynomolgus macaque origin and failed to block viral spread in rhesus macaque PCLS (Fig 3B). Thus, TMPRSS2 is expressed in macaque respiratory epithelium and serine protease activity is required for FLUAV spread in lung tissue of human, macaque and marmoset origin.",

            "text": "A constantly accumulating body of evidence suggests that TMPRSS2 is exploited by FLUAV for spread. Thus, directed and endogenous expression of TMPRSS2 in cell culture was shown to activate FLUAV HA [12,14,15] and the protease was found to be expressed in receptor-positive cells in the human aerodigestive tract [13]. Moreover, several studies reported that TMPRSS2 expression is required for spread and pathogenesis of diverse FLUAV in mice [16,18,41]. Furthermore, inactivation of the tmprss2 gene in mice is compatible with normal development and homeostasis [42], indicating that TMPRSS2 is dispensable for cellular and organismic survival and thus an attractive drug target. However, the contribution of TMPRSS2 to viral spread in human and NHP is less well understood. Here, we show that the macaque and marmoset orthologues of TMPRSS2 cleave and activate FLUAV HA and that TMPRSS2 is expressed in rhesus macaque respiratory epithelium. Moreover, we demonstrate that FLUAV spread in human, macaque and marmoset respiratory epithelium can be blocked by a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2. These results suggest that macaques might be suitable to model TMPRSS2 usage by FLUAV in humans.",

The N-terminal domain is located in the cytoplasm and is followed by a transmembrane domain, a stem region and a protease domain [27]. The enzymes are synthesized as zymogens in the constitutive secretory pathway and can be auto-catalytically activated by cleavage between the stem region and the protease domain [27]. The enzymes encoded by tmprss2 of NHP origin exhibited up to 88% amino acid sequence identity with their human counterparts, including the presence of a catalytic triad located in the protease domain that is essential for enzymatic activity, and similar observations were made for the NHP orthologous TMPRSS4 and HAT. Moreover, all tested proteases were readily expressed in transfected 293T cells and evidence for auto-activation in these cells was obtained. Therefore, it was not unexpected that all TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT orthologues of NHP origin were able to cleave and activate HA. Whether the subtle differences in activation efficiency observed between marmoset TMPRSS2 and the other TMPRSS2 orthologues tested translate into differential HA activation in the infected host is at present unknown.",

Expression was detected in human bronchiolar epithelium [13] and the present study indicates that substantial levels of TMPRSS2 are also produced in bronchiolar epithelial cells of rhesus macaques. However, potential differences in the cell type specificity of TMPRSS2 expression in human and NHP respiratory tissue can at present not be excluded. Thus, we previously detected TMPRSS2 protein mainly in type II pneumocytes within human tissue samples [13] and these cells can be targeted by FLUAV. In contrast, Matsuyama and colleagues found that TMPRSS2 was predominantly expressed in type I pneumocytes in healthy cynomolgus macaques, although in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, they detected viral antigen and TMPRSS2 protein in type II pneumocytes [43].",

We addressed this question employing the serine protease inhibitor camostat, since this compound was previously shown to block viral activation by TMPRSS2 in the absence of unwanted cytotoxicity [40], and since PCLS are not amenable to extensive manipulation, including transfection with siRNAs. Camostat markedly and dose-dependently reduced FLUAV spread in PCLS of human, macaque and marmoset origin without inducing cytotoxic effects, in keeping with recent data showing that camostat inhibits FLUAV replication and cytokine production in cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells [44]. Thus, FLUAV depends on the activity of a serine protease(s), potentially TMPRSS2, for spread in human and NHP respiratory tissue, although it should be stated that exclusively viruses of the H1N1 subtype were tested in the present study and it cannot be excluded that protease choice of other subtypes may differ.",
