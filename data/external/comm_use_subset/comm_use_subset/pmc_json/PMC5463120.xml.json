This could be a result of the absence of immunity acquired by the population against the new genotypes [4, 15]. Genotype A ON1 shows a duplication of 72 nucleotides in the C-terminal third of the G gene. The region of the G protein encoded by this gene sequence is targeted by specific genotype neutralizing antibodies, which may contribute to the escape of the virus from the population immunity induced by previous contact with other genotypes. However, according to the National Registry of Hospitalization Cases, there was no increase in the frequency of hospitalizations of infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis between 2013 and 2015 in Brazil and the State of S\u00e3o Paulo compared to the previous five years [16]. It is possible that, acting as a controller, the immunity of the population only contributes to the selection of genotypes that replace each other without necessarily increasing the number of cases when genotypes without recent incidences appear.",

Additionally, the age group was a differential factor since children up to 5 years of age were included, including infants with bronchiolitis and also cases of posterior HRSV infections [19].
