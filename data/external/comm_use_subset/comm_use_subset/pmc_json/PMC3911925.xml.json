            "text": "Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years age worldwide, including in HIV-infected children [1]\u2013[3]. The aetiology of childhood pneumonia may include infection with bacteria and/or respiratory viruses. Although respiratory viruses are more frequently identified than bacteria in children with pneumonia, this may be biased by lack of availability of sensitive and specific tests for diagnosing bacterial causes of pneumonia [4]. Furthermore, respiratory viral infections may heighten the susceptibility to developing a super-imposed bacterial infection resulting in severe pneumonia [5], [6]. Traditionally, respiratory viruses that have been associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses I\u2013III (PIV I\u2013III), influenza viruses A/B and adenovirus. Two human coronaviruses (CoV), OC43 (CoV-OC43) and 229E (CoV-229E) were initially identified as causes of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) in the 1960s using classical culture methods [7], [8]. More recently, advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the discovery of other respiratory viruses which have also been associated with LRTI. Included among these are human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [9], human bocavirus (hBoV) [10], human coronavirus NL63 (CoV-NL63) [11] and HKU1 (CoV-HKU1) [12] and WU and KI polyomaviruses (WUPyV, KIPyV) [13]\u2013[15]. Also, human rhinovirus (hRV), which was previously mainly associated with mild URTI, has increasingly been implicated in having a role in the pathogenesis of LRTI and asthma exacerbations [16], [17].",

Hospital-based surveillance for all-cause hospitalization was undertaken at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital, the only public hospital in the study community. Hospitalized children had their signs and symptoms recorded and underwent HIV testing according to the study protocol [24]. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were obtained for respiratory viral studies from children hospitalized with LRTI [5], and archived from January 2000 onward. In the present study only NPA collected from 1st February 2000 to 31st January 2002 from children less than 2 years old were analysed. If a child had recurrent LRTI hospitalizations, only NPA collected at least 28 days apart were included in the analysis. Blood cultures were performed with the use of an automated blood-culture system (BacT-Alert, Organon Teknika).",

Children were categorized as having bronchiolitis in the presence of wheezing on chest auscultation and in the absence of documented CXR-AC or bronchial breathing on chest wall auscultation. A clinical diagnosis of WHO severe/very severe pneumonia was made if the child had a cough <14 days in duration and lower chest wall in-drawing and/or any of the following signs and symptoms of severe pneumonia: feeding difficulties, convulsions, central cyanosis, or encephalopathy. The previously developed respiratory index of severity in children (RISC) score was used to compare disease severity between single and multiple viral infections [26].",

A recent study from South Africa on children with ARI requiring medical attention, 61% (N = 383) being HIV-infected or HIV-seropositive, also reported that hRV was the most frequently detected virus (33%) followed by RSV (30%), PIV (8%) and hBoV (6%) [21]. In the South African study hospitalized children with respiratory disease had higher hRV detection rates compared to healthy children (36% vs. 19%; p = 0.047) which may indicate a causality effect of hRV in disease [21]. In Kenya in older children (5\u201317 years old), despite hRV being the most commonly detected virus (38%) in patients presenting with ARI, its detection rate was similar among asymptomatic controls [28]. Indeed two other studies in Kenya found that with the exception of RSV, viral detection in the nasopharynx did not have a significant association with pneumonia in hospitalized children under 5 years [29] or under 12 years, [30] compared to children both without symptoms of URTI or with respiratory symptoms but not meeting any criteria for pneumonia.",

An analysis of serial respiratory samples from otherwise healthy children detected shedding of CoV-NL63 for up 21 days [31], hRV up to 41 days and of hBoV up to 44 days [32]. Detection of CoV-HKU1 and CoV-229E in respiratory specimens of transplanted children were also reported for at least 38 days and 11 weeks, respectively, possibly suggesting that immunocompromised children may have a prolonged duration of shedding of these viruses [33], [34]. Such prolonged shedding in immunocompromised individuals such as HIV-infected children, may result in a greater frequency of co-incidental identification of these viruses when investigated for respiratory illness, affect the seasonal occurrence of the viruses as well as potentially present a threat to greater nosocomial transmission of these viruses because of higher incidence of hospitalization of HIV-infected children.",

In the case of hBoV serological studies have shown that the presence of viral DNA in respiratory samples was not proof of an acute primary infection and that prolonged viral shedding could be an explanation for viral detection at high rates in asymptomatic controls [35]. Enrolment of healthy non-hospitalized children and quantification of viral loads may help to elucidate the problem of co-infections and is currently being under-taken in a multi-centre study on aetiology of pneumonia in children [36]. Contradictory findings on whether infection with multiple viruses contribute to disease severity in hospitalized children have been reported, with some studies reporting an increased severity among children with viral co-infections [21], [37] and others finding decrease severity associated with co-infections [38]. In some studies no differences were observed [39]. We found that multiple viral infections were associated with bronchial breathing in HIV-infected children and with cyanosis and wheezing in HIV-uninfected children. Bacterial co-infections can also increase the severity of viral diseases [40]. Furthermore, in children with invasive pneumococcal disease, superimposed viral co-infections are common and may lead to higher mortality rates [41]. Of the participants in our study from whom bacterial cultures performed, no differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics were observed between children with or without viral infections. Our analysis, however, included PCV9 vaccinees who probably present with less severe LRTI cases since it was shown before that PCV9 vaccination was associated with a decrease in LRTI viral-associated hospitalizations [5], [23]. We detected a high prevalence of bacterial co-infections with the newly-tested viruses especially in HIV-infected children (8%), what may have contributed to the higher C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, the longer hospital stay and the higher mortality in HIV-infected children compared to HIV-uninfected.",

Although the sensitivity of the conventional methods is reported to be high, comparative studies have shown that RT-PCR is considerably more sensitive for detection of respiratory viruses [21], [49].
