The primary purpose of smart healthcare is to offer pervasive and personalized medical services and health protection to people. Computer-aided diagnosis and decision making of this personalized treatment plan is one of the current developments in precision medicine [3, 4]. Smart healthcare aims to provide intelligent comprehensive differentiation and prescription recommendation for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases by applying artificial intelligence technology and cloud computing to the practice of clinical medicine. It has been greatly developed through the applications of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data analysis, and Internet of Things (IoT), and has been applied to many medical fields such as intelligent Chinese medicine and intelligent testing. Medical big data is to integrate the IoT system into medicine and to integrate and classify the collected medical data information by creating the medical Internet of Things [5, 6]. The deep learning model and the deep reinforcement learning model are the most commonly used artificial intelligence models, which can be trained and simulated by providing a large number of training examples through medical big data. The computer aids of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine have matured. Thus, there are many well-trained deep learning models for clinical medicine.",

However, pathogens of lung infections are complex, and it is difficult to carry out biological cultivation and identification. Particularly, complex lung infections have various clinical manifestations: the mortality rate is high and the treatment is difficult, the traditional pathogen detection methods have low positive rate; it is a long time-consuming and complicated operation, and it is difficult to meet the requirements of diagnosis and treatment of complex infectious diseases. Classical pathogen detection methods include bacterial (fungal) culture, microscopy and antibody testing, and PCR-based pathogen-specific nucleic acid detection. These methods have made great progress in the diagnosis of pulmonary infectious diseases, but they have low sensitivity and poor timeliness; pathogen identification information and drug resistance information are not comprehensive, so it is impossible to identify unknown and rare pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, clinical diagnosis of pulmonary infectious diseases is very difficult.",

Compared with shallow networks, multi-hidden-layer network models have better feature representation capabilities. It first uses the unsupervised learning to conduct greedy pretraining on layer by layer and then supervises the whole network with supervised learning. This pretraining method provides ideal initial parameters for deep neural networks and reduces the optimization difficulty of deep neural networks [16, 17]. Typical DL models include Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

The reason is that it can directly optimize the expected total reward of the strategy and search for the optimal strategy directly in the strategic space in an end-to-end manner, eliminating the cumbersome intermediate links.

Therefore, in the DRL method based on search and supervision, strategy search is generally done through MCTS. For example, the AlphaGo algorithm combines deep neural networks with MCTS to achieve remarkable results. Its main idea has two points: (1) using MCTS to approximate the value function of each state; (2) using the CNN based on value function to evaluate the current layout and walk of the board. AlphaGo's complete learning system consists of the following components:Strategy Network. It is divided into a strategy network for supervised learning and a strategy network for RL. The role of the strategy network is to predict and sample the next move based on the current situation.Rollout Strategy. The goal is also to predict the next step, but the speed of prediction is 1000 times that of the strategy network.Value Network.

However, in some complex real-world scenarios, the agent needs to be able to handle multiple tasks at the same time. At this time, multitask learning and transfer learning are extremely important. In the RL field, Wilson et al. [23] used a hierarchical hybrid Bayesian model to provide prior knowledge of new tasks, enabling agents to better adapt to new task scenarios. For partially observable random multitasking scenarios, Li et al. [24] developed a regionalized policy representation to describe the behaviour of agents in different task scenarios. The method used the clustering properties contained in the Dirichlet process to share training scenarios between similar tasks and to pass valuable information between different tasks. Compared with the single-task learning mode, the multitask RL method has achieved more outstanding performance in both lattice world navigation and multitarget classification tasks. Taylor and Stone [25] proposed a way to transfer value functions between different tasks. Fernfindez Vdoso [26] used a mapping that reflects the relationship between the agent's current and past state action pairs, enabling the previously learned strategies to be transferred to new tasks in a timely manner. Wang et al. [27] concluded that the transfer learning in RL falls into two broad categories: behavioural transfer and knowledge transfer.

The second-generation sequencing technology has a higher detection rate than the traditional culture method [33, 34]. Compared with the traditional single-plex PCR method, it not only reduces the sample nucleic acid requirement and expands the detection range, but also has better specificity and sensitivity [11, 12]. Detection of viral pathogens mainly includes virus antigen detection, nucleic acid detection, and virus isolation and culture. However, the traditional virus pathogen detection has a low positive rate; thus, it is difficult to promote and apply in clinical practice. Second-generation sequencing technology is superior to traditional virus detection techniques in terms of sensitivity and accuracy. It theoretically reveals all microbial information in the sample, which can detect more virus types and its positive rate is higher [35]. Detectable viruses include well-known upper respiratory tract viruses and lower respiratory tract viruses such as HSV and CMV in immunosuppressed hosts. With the increasing range of pathogens based on second-generation sequencing technology, it is found that the proportion of viruses in respiratory infections is much higher than previously thought. The applications of SGS technology to detect in-hospital-acquired viral pneumonia in real time and rapid detection have shown that SGS technology can learn evidence faster than traditional methods, so that timely measures are taken to control outbreaks of nosocomial infections.",

Among patients with drugs, the incidence of fungal infections is also increasing [36]. Culture has long dominated the diagnosis of fungal infections, but traditional methods have inherent deficiencies in identifying mixed infections and analyzing the flora structure and dynamics of the flora and many fungi or undiscovered new ones. It is difficult or even impossible to cultivate the strain. These kinds of problems all suggest that we urgently need a new method to assist clinical diagnosis more accurately and quickly. Different from the bacterial DNA extraction method, the second-generation technology in the fungal flora structure spectrum method mainly through the amplification, sequencing, and analysis of the fungus ITS1 (internal transcribed spacer) and ITS2 gene fragments, using ITS1/ITS2 gene sequencing technology, generally, 50 to 60 genera were detected, and the sequence of fungal ITS gene obtained by sequencing can be matched by the existing gene database. However, for the most common clinical genera of Candida and Aspergillus, ITS gene sequencing can well identify their ITS gene sequences, and some pathogen strains can be distinguished at the species level. Fungi not only cause lung dysfunction, but also because of the long treatment time, affect the prognosis of the disease, and the second-generation sequencing technology helps to understand the whole picture of airway microbes from the overall structure of the community and in complex lung infections, especially AIDS, etc. The diagnosis of Pneumocystis is important in immunodeficient patients [37].",

The second-generation sequencing technology not only discovers known pathogens, but also discovers completely unknown pathogens [38, 39]. About 70% of patients with infectious diseases cannot determine pathogen information due to traditional detection methods and cannot be treated in a timely and effective manner, thus worsening the condition. Therefore, rapid and accurate pathogen detection methods are of great significance for effective diagnosis and timely control of infectious diseases. There are many types of modern molecular typing techniques, and the most commonly used molecular techniques in the traceability and monitoring of infectious diseases are multisequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multisite tandem repeats. Sequence analysis (MLVA), etc., and the emerging high-resolution WGS technology guarantee the accurate traceability and monitoring of infectious diseases and can also complement each other with multiple molecular technologies to improve the accuracy of detection. WGS technology can track the prevalence of pathogens and more accurately identify possible sources of pathogens [40, 41]. And with the continuous development of this technology, the current traceability and monitoring capabilities for unknown pathogens are becoming more and more prominent. The pathogens of severe pulmonary infection are usually unclear. Currently, the clinical use of antigen/antibody immunology methods and traditional microbial culture techniques is used for diagnosis. However, these methods have problems of long culture period and low culture positive rate. The second-generation sequencing technology is a novel DNA/RNA sequencing method based on the detection of nucleic acid molecules, which has high sensitivity and short time-consuming, and does not depend on traditional pathogenic culture. The application of antibiotics in the early stage has little effect on the detection results. Accurate and rapid identification of microbial pathogens in patients with lung infections may result in targeted antibacterial therapies, with fewer side effects and lower costs. In particular, patients with tracheal intubation are measured by sputum extraction from the lower respiratory tract of the bronchus, which can more accurately provide pathogenic bacteria analysis of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further guiding clinical treatment and prognosis. With the development of second-generation sequencing technology, processing and sequencing time will be further reduced. The SGS method will eventually provide clinicians with rapid, accurate, independent culture-based identification of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity characteristics [42].",

Different from the application of SGS detection in hereditary diseases, the complex composition of infectious disease specimens and the low level of nucleic acid of pathogenic microorganisms all restrict the detection of SGS in pathogenic microorganisms of lung infection. The first problem is sensitivity. Although SGS detection shows great advantages over traditional methods in diagnosing rare and rare pathogens, the sensitivity of common pathogens such as Cryptococcus is not stronger than traditional methods. Even if these pathogens detected by traditional methods, SGS may not detect or detect only a very small number of specific fragments, which affects the results. For example, for the metagenomics detection of M. tuberculosis, the current optimal solution is still to perform SGS sequencing on the basis of MGIT960 liquid culture. The reason may be that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis are intracellular bacteria, and the current detection method is mainly to detect the intracellular infection with M. tuberculosis by using the sputum supernatant; and M. tuberculosis due to nucleic acid of GC is relatively high (60% higher), and the melting method of most bacteria cannot fully dissociate the nucleic acid strand of M. tuberculosis. Therefore, under the condition of specimen processing suitable for most pathogenic microorganisms, the detection of tuberculosis cannot be effectively achieved. At present, direct SGS testing of clinical specimens to diagnose M. tuberculosis infection is very difficult. As an alternative, it is often the case that the clinical specimens are cultured for tuberculosis and then SGS is detected to improve the positive rate of clinical specimen detection, which increases the financial burden of the patient.",

This requires us to continue to optimize the detection method of SGS on the one hand, so that it can cover the range of pathogens as much as possible and improve the detection rate. On the other hand, we must understand that SGS technology has limitations and cannot be completely dependent on SGS detection [43]. At the same time, traditional methods cannot be ignored, and other effective pathogen detection methods should be retained or explored as supplements or verifications. For patients with partial lung abscess or granuloma, because the disease is confined to the lungs, the amount of pathogens released into the blood and alveolar lavage fluid is limited, so for these diseases, pathogens can only be detected by SGS detection of tissue samples. Deep reinforcement learning can fully learn the potential results by simulating human brain learning and decision making based on the given complex data. Thus, it is a good choice to integrate DRL with SGS for clinical pathogen detection.",

Nonpathogenic, unrelated pathogens, and ambiguous pathogens are often seen in SGS reports. The lungs are an open environment, connected to the outside world, there are airway and oral colonization bacteria, many fragments of different species can be detected in the sputum and alveolar lavage fluid, and many unexplained samples can often be detected in the specimen. Part of the reason may be the contamination of specimens and reagents, such as environmental microbes (such as plants, plant viruses, etc.), which are difficult to discriminate. For these contaminations, it is necessary to eliminate the comparison between the laboratory quality control and the data between the specimens. DRL can combine all the related data to learn a favorable result through training and decision making; thus, it may effectively solve the poor specificity of the clinical application of SGS.",

The core of SGS testing for the diagnosis of lung infections is the identification of responsible pathogens. Since SGS testing often yields a large number of backgrounds or unrelated microbial fragments, it is critical to find or identify responsible pathogens. It is first necessary to establish a knowledge database of common microorganisms for lung infections: a database of background microorganisms common to each laboratory and testing unit in SGS testing and record the number of common fragments detected. If a suspected pathogen fragment that is not in the range of common background bacteria appears in the SGS test of clinical specimens, or the number of fragments of a certain microorganism is significantly higher than the data in the background microbial database, it is included in the suspected responsible pathogen, and further methods are used for authenticating. In the alveolar lavage fluid, possible responsible bacteria, fungi, or virus fragments were detected by SGS, and the proportion of the total fragments was often extremely low, even only a few fragments, which is difficult to be diagnosed. SGS testing is often only useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary systemic infections, and when pathogens for nonclinical routine screening are detected, further use of classical pathogen detection methods is needed for diagnosis. This requires the development of a well-developed pathogen verification test system, especially for pathogenic microorganisms that are not easily detected by some common methods. Because the current SGS testing cost is still high, it cannot be widely used in the clinic, and it also affects its timeliness. SGS is also only a pathogen detection method, and it has just been applied in clinical practice. Therefore, there are also blind spots and misunderstandings of its monitoring. The excessive expectation and interpretation of SGS detection results can not only push up the cost of clinical testing, but also make it effective. The examination could not be carried out smoothly, which also led to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.",

Moreover, the difference in the location and method of the specimen will also affect the test results. Therefore, using the deep reinforcement learning, based on the patient's medical history and clinical examination, the possible pathogens are presumed, the specimens are preprocessed and then sequenced, and even different strategies are adopted for the biosignal analysis of the sequencing results. Taking into account various unknown pathogens, the detection rate of specific pathogens and the interpretation of the results are improved. The deep reinforcement learning is a diagnostic basis to reduce errors. It sets certain standards and procedures to determine whether the detected pathogen is a responsible pathogen, and designing targeted evaluation sequencing methods based on different types of pathogens to improve the effectiveness of SGS. Therefore, the deep reinforcement learning combined with knowledge graph is a promising direction for SGS in the application of pulmonary infectious diseases.",
