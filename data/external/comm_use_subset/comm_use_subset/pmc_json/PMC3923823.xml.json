In this study design, samples are collected from patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), and the influenza VE is estimated by comparing the vaccination status of patients who test positive for influenza with that of those who test negative, including non-influenza respiratory virus (NIRV) cases [5]. Although this study design allows for reliable influenza VE estimates, non-specific immunity induced by influenza infection may have an effect on the estimates [6]. It has been hypothesised that influenza infection induces a short-term, non-specific immunity and reduces the risk of subsequent NIRV infections. Therefore, people who are vaccinated for influenza and are less likely to be naturally infected with influenza may be at a higher risk of NIRV infections [6], [7]. If this association is true, NIRV-positive cases are more likely to have been vaccinated for influenza; thus, influenza VE estimates in test-negative case-control studies using the influenza-negative controls, including NIRV-positive cases, may overestimate the true VE, but supporting evidence is limited.",

These values were lower than those determined for the 2010\u20132011 season (VE = 56\u201358%), when A(H1N1)pdm09 was the dominant strain [18], [19]. Two reasons are proposed to explain this low influenza VE in Europe. First, a poor match between the TIV reference strain and the circulating A(H3N2) strain was reported [20], [21]. A substantial proportion of circulating viruses showed reduced reactivity against A/Perth/16/2009, the vaccine virus used for the 2011\u20132012 northern hemisphere seasons [21]. Second, a decrease in the influenza VE in the late phase of the season was observed. In the UK, VE against influenza A(H3N2) decreased from 43% in the early phase (Oct 2011\u2013Jan 2012) to 17% in the late phase (Feb 2012\u2013Apr 2012) [4]. Additionally, the VE against influenza decreased from 37% to 19% in Spain [8]. The late peak of influenza in the season and waning immunity may have reduced the overall VE [4], [8], [9].",

HI assays using post-infection ferret antiserum raised against the vaccine virus recommended for the 2011\u20132012 influenza vaccine, A/Victoria/210/2009(H3N2), showed that 34% of the test viruses had a reduction in HI titre of eight-fold or more [14]. In our phylogenetic analysis, all sequences of A(H3N2) viruses were considerably separated from the vaccine reference strain. The vaccine strain mismatch partially explains the low influenza VE in Japan. Additionally, despite the limited sample size, a decreasing trend in VE was observed in our setting; specifically, the adjusted VE against influenza A was 21.7% in the early phase and 8.9% in the late phase.

Although the confidence intervals were wide and overlapping, the point estimate was highest when we used NIRV-positive controls, followed by all influenza-negative controls and RV-negative controls. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis recently proposed by Cowling et al [6]. According to their theoretical discussion, people naturally infected with influenza are protected from subsequent NIRV infection because influenza infection induces a short-term, non-specific immunity, whereas vaccinated people are protected from influenza infection but have a higher risk of NIRV infections. In fact, Cowling et al conducted a randomised controlled trial and demonstrated that TIV recipients had an increased risk of NIRV infections [7]. If the hypothesis is true, NIRV-positive cases are more likely to have been vaccinated for influenza; thus, in the test-negative case-control study, estimates of VE using the NIRV-positive controls are higher than those using all influenza-negative controls and those using RV-negative controls. A supporting finding was reported in Australia; specifically, Kelly et al conducted a test-negative case-control study on children and demonstrated that the influenza VE was 58% when all influenza-negative controls were used and 68% when NIRV-positive controls were used [22]. On the other hand, Sundaram et al recently reported that the VE did not differ when they used all influenza-negative controls and RV-negative controls [23].",

This study design allows for the collection of appropriate controls that are derived from the same source population as the cases. One of the most important assumptions in this design is that the controls are drawn from the population without consideration of their vaccination status [6], [24]. If the risk of NIRV infection is high among the people vaccinated for influenza, the inclusion of NIRV-positive cases in the test-negative control group overestimates the true VE; this phenomenon may be what we observed in the current study. However, our findings do not provide conclusive evidence regarding the effect of NIRVs on VE estimates. Also, it must be noted that NIRV positivity in nasopharyngeal samples does not necessarily indicate NIRV disease [25]. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the validity of including NIRV-positive cases in test-negative case-control studies.",

Although the use of RIDT tends to underestimate the true VEs [5] and does not consider NIRV infection status, the test-negative case-control study using RIDT is a reliable assessment tool for influenza VEs.",

Recall biases may have affected our VE estimates. Although all potential confounders were considered, unmeasured confounders, such as socioeconomic status, may have remained. The confidence intervals of our VE estimates were wide because of the small sample size. However, the VE point estimates were low and consistent with other studies. We therefore believe that the increase in the number of samples does not fundamentally change our conclusions. On the other hand, larger sample sizes and longer study periods are required in future studies to assess the age group specific- and season specific-effects of NIRVs on VE estimates.",
