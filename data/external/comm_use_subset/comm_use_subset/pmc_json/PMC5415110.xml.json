In 2013, the Instituto de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos (InDRE; Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference) implemented a differential diagnosis of influenza that included 14 other respiratory viruses [15]. Due to this, at this moment Mexico does not have enough epidemiological information about the great diversity of viruses causing Acute Respiratory Infection. This lack of information, makes physicians search only for influenza, it is therefore the most requested confirmatory test in the laboratory during the whole year, even when we are out of influenza season (season comprises from October to May), leading to useless negative influenza results in most of the cases, without identifying the real causal agent of ARI in Mexico. This problem have direct implications for each patient, as the clinician does not know the causal agent, the patient does not receive the suitable treatment. It also has implications that affect the whole society, because the ignorance of the circulation patterns and incidence of other respiratory viruses limit preventive actions by health institutions.",

Generally, the peak of respiratory infections occurs in the period between November and April in countries of the northern hemisphere [59\u201360]. The influenza season is well known in Mexico and worldwide; however, the seasons of other respiratory viruses are not well known. According to our results, the highest prevalence of these viruses in Mexico appears to occur from October to March (autumn and winter), which coincides with the influenza season. Detection was significantly higher in November of 2014; during this month, there was a marked decrease in the national mean temperature from 23.3 to 18.3\u00b0C. According to Cui et al. [61], mean temperature is the key climatic parameter associated with the prevalence of many respiratory viruses because some viruses survive and/or replicate better at low temperatures [61]. On the other hand, Viegas et al [62] proposed that mucus release by cilia was reduced when the temperature of the respiratory tract was lowered; consequently, the local innate immune response (neutrophil and natural killer (NK) cell migration) was also reduced, thereby promoting viral infection.",
