In this study, to determine the intracellular distribution of N protein at the protein level, PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells were lysed, separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and analyzed by western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, PCNA protein was detected only in the nuclear fraction, whereas GAPDH was mostly present in the cytoplasmic fraction, confirming the successful separation of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. The N protein was detected in the virus-infected nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1C, lanes 3, 4 and 5). In addition, multiple bands appeared on the western blots, because the N proteins of coronaviruses are phosphorylated in virus-infected cells (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that N is a protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the role of N protein in viral replication.",

Three distinct proteins that are mainly located in the nucleolus have been identified3738: the major nucleolar protein fibrillarin, which is a component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein that is involved in rRNA processing; NPM1, which is a putative ribosome assembly factor; and nucleolin, which is involved in the processing of precursor rRNA. To characterize the level of expression of N, NPM1, fibrillarin and nucleolin, encoding plasmids were constructed with Myc or 3\u00d7Flag at the N-terminus of each protein. Individual expression plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, and their expression was assessed using western blotting (Fig. S1). As measured by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against N (see Supplementary Fig. S1A), Myc (see Supplementary Fig. S1B) or Flag (see Supplementary Fig. S1C) tag, individual expression constructs encoding N, NPM1 and fibrillarin proteins were expressed at different levels at the appropriate size, however, the construct encoding nucleolin failed to be expressed. To investigate the possible molecular target of N in the nucleolar, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments were performed. The result indicated that N protein showed an interaction with NPM1 in the Co-IP assay (Fig. 2A,B). To investigate whether N protein is able to interact with endogenous NPM1 in the context of PEDV infection, virus-infected Vero E6 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-NPM1 mAb and probed for the presence of N protein with anti-N mAb. N protein was readily detected in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that N protein indeed interacts with endogenous NPM1 protein in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells. However, the interaction of N protein with fibrillarin or nucleolin was not observed in the Co-IP assay (see supplementary Fig. S2A and B).",

Beads carrying GST or GST-NPM1 were incubated with lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with pCMV-Myc-N. After thorough rinsing, the protein complex captured on the beads was solubilized, subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing gel, and immunoblotted with anti-Myc or anti-GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, the GST-NPM1 protein could pull down Myc-N. In contrast, GST alone did not pull down Myc-N. These data indicate that N protein can specifically interact with NPM1.",

A recent study41 showed that NPM1 can be sumoylated on both Lys-230 and Lys-263 residues, although Lys 263 is the major sumoylation site. Mutation of K263 alters its subcellular distribution, and K263R mutation makes NPM1 susceptible to caspase-3 cleavage and decreases cell proliferation. Intriguingly, Thr-199, Lys-230 and Lys-263 are all located in the C-terminal domain of the NPM1 protein, which is essential for the interaction of NPM1 with N protein. To explore whether Thr-199, Lys-230 and Lys-263 have a role in the association between NPM1 and N protein, we co-transfected various 3\u00d7Flag-NPM1 constructs into HEK293T cells with Myc-N. Co-IP assays demonstrated that the unphosphorylated T199A, unsumoylated K230R and K263R were able to bind Myc-N, and had either moderate effects or no effect on N protein binding (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "NPM1 localizes in granular regions of the nucleolus42, is associated with preribosomal particles43, and forms pentamers that may be important for the assembly of ribosomes44. NPM1 has the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm45; it binds to nuclear/nucleolar localization signal containing peptides45, and thus serves as a shuttle protein in nuclear/nucleolar import. Interestingly, in this study we also found that the NPM1 interacts with N protein, suggesting that NPM1 may serve as a shuttle protein for transport of N protein into the nucleolus, although the interaction domain of NPM1\u2013N (aa 148\u2013294) is not within the fragment of N protein that contains the nucleolus localization signal (aa 70\u201390). It is hypothesized that transport of N protein into the nucleolus depends on the movement of NPM1 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. To examine this hypothesis, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with pAcGFP-N and pDsRed-NPM1, and time-lapse images were acquired at 12\u201372 hpt at 5 min intervals. The transport into the nucleolus, interaction with NPM1 and export of N protein in transfected cells were clearly observed at 42\u201343 hpt. As shown in Fig. 5A, NPM1 protein appeared first in the nucleolus (t = 10 min) and then a small amount of N was observed in the nucleolus at 42 hpt (t = 30 min). N protein accumulated continuously in the nucleolus of transfected cells and interacted with NPM1 until t = 30\u201355 min, and was exported from the nucleolus at t = 55\u201360 min. Real-time visualization of the kinetics of nucleolar import, interaction with NPM1 and export of N protein indicated that the process was rapid, taking only 30 min in total, thereby ruling out the possibility that the nucleolar localization of N protein is NPM1 independent. The time-lapse video showing the kinetics of nucleolar translocation of N protein and its interaction with NPM1 is provided as supplementary material (Video S3 in the Supplementary materials). To corroborate our findings, we first tested whether depletion of NPM1 by specific siRNAs resulted in reduced nuclear import of N. For this purpose, three pairs of NPM1 siRNAs were synthesized. These siRNAs were transfected into Vero E6 cells, and it was found that NPM1 siRNA (2+3) reduced the level of expression of NPM1 (Fig. 5B). In addition, we examined the viability of cells receiving siRNA using the CCK-8 assay. The results showed that there was no difference between NPM1 RNAi and RNAi control in terms of the viability of transfected cells (see Supplementary Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 5C, transport of N protein was hardly affected in cells with reduced NPM1 levels in comparison with that in the cells treated with a scramble siRNA (siScr), mock-treated cells. As a control, we also co-transfected Vero E6 cells with Myc-N and 3\u00d7Flag-NPM1, but did not observe a stimulation of nuclear import of Myc-N with the increased expression of the NPM1 protein (Fig. 5D).",

            "text": "Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an essential event in animal development and is observed in many developing tissues in both invertebrates and vertebrates. The activation of the caspase family is a central event in apoptosis. Downstream caspases include caspase-3, the precursor form of which is predominantly synthesized in the cytosol46. Activated caspase-3 can be translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus47. Caspase-3 is activated by upstream caspases and then cleaves many intracellular target proteins to induce apoptotic cell death; for example, NPM1 is a substrate of caspase-348. To explore whether N protein binding has any role in mediating the apoptotic cleavage of NPM1, we transiently transfected Myc-N and empty vector into Vero E6 cells and then treated with or without 100 \u03bcM of Ac-DEVD-CHO (caspase-3 inhibitor). The cells induced apoptotic cleavage of NPM1 by treatment with an apoptosis inducer, staurosporine (STS), or not. Apoptotic stimulus clearly demonstrated that NPM1 protein cleavage and occurred in empty vector cells following STS treatment. In contrast, NPM1 was almost intact when N was overexpressed in Vero E6 cells with or no STS treatment, highlighting that nucleolus-targeted N prevents apoptotic degradation of NPM1 (Fig. 8A). Meanwhile, cleaved caspase-3 was found in STS treated cells (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, Ac-DEVD-CHO, a caspase-3 inhibitor, was able to restore the STS-induced NPM1 and caspase-3 protein cleavage (Fig. 8B). This suggests that interaction with N protein protects NPM1 from apoptotic degradation. A number of studies have indicated that NPM1, one of the major nucleolar phosphoproteins, is involved in the regulation of nucleolar function during cellular differentiation49 and in antiapoptosis48. To evaluate whether the N\u2013NPM1 complex is important in prevention of apoptosis, we studied Vero E6 cells transiently expressing Myc or Myc-N and induced apoptosis by STS. Compared with cells with no STS treatment, a DNA fragmentation assay revealed that overexpression of PEDV N protein slightly diminished DNA degradation. By contrast, robust DNA fragmentation was detected in cells transiently expressing Myc tag (Fig. 8C). To evaluate further the antiapoptotic effect of N protein in vivo, we examined the sensitivity of Vero E6 cells transfected with Myc-N or empty vector and with induction of apoptosis by treatment with STS or not. DAPI and TUNEL staining of the nucleus revealed that Myc-N transfected cells displayed greater viability after stimulation by STS and were markedly less sensitive to STS-induced apoptosis than empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 8D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the N\u2013NPM1 interaction plays an essential role in protecting cells from apoptotic degradation, thus promoting cell survival.",

The function of N protein during PEDV infection is thought to require interaction with cellular proteins, therefore in this study we investigated whether the PEDV N protein interacts with three major nucleolar antigens: NPM1, fibrillarin and nucleolin. Interaction with one or all of these antigens may explain our previous observations that PEDV N protein is localized to the nucleolus15.

The N protein also interacted with porcine NPM1 (Fig. 2F). In the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A,B) and the GST-NPM1 fusion protein pull down assay (Fig. 2D), both in vitro translated and cellular NPM1 were shown to interact with N protein. The immunoprecipitation experiment in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells provided further support for the in vivo binding of NPM1 and N protein (Fig. 2C). The confocal microscopy analysis showed the co-localization of NPM1 and N in the nucleolus (Fig. 2E), and the in vitro binding studies utilizing deletion mutants of N or NPM1 defined the binding sites of these two proteins. As shown in Fig. 3B,3C and 3D, apart from the full-length protein, only the N variants containing the NR2 fragment, NR2, NR1+2 and NR2+3, but not the C-terminal or N-terminal fragment, were able to bind to NPM1, suggesting that the domain that interacts with NPM1 is within amino acid residues 148\u2013294 of N. Interestingly, this region of N consists of an SR-domain, containing serine and arginine residues50, and is involved in cell signaling and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation51. NPM1 has been reported to bind to the arginine-rich basic region of the human T-cell leukemia virus protein Rex52, and to the HIV proteins Rev23 and Tat53. However, further studies will be required to determine more precisely the location of the interaction domain and the specific amino acid residues that participate in the interaction.",

These three activities reside in nearly independent but partially overlapping segments of the polypeptide chain56. The N-terminal nonpolar region and the acidic region of the middle portion of NPM1 are important for its chaperone activity, and the C-terminal is essential for nucleic acid binding56. Interestingly, analysis of the binding sites of targeting proteins on NPM1 has revealed that most of them reside in the C-terminal portion of the molecule. For example, NPM1 binds to the nucleolar proteins P12057, nucleolin58, and Tat53 through a fragment of NPM1 containing amino acids 187\u2013215 or 194\u2013239. This is in accordance with the interaction of N protein with NPM1, which occurs at the C-terminal portion of NPM1 (Fig. 3F). The binding region of NPM1 for viral proteins HDAg59 and Rex52 has been localized to these acidic regions. Therefore, these results suggest that the interaction of NPM1 with N protein is similar to the interactions with nucleolar protein p120, nucleolin, and Tat, but is different from the interaction of NPM1 with the viral proteins HDAg and Rex.",

However, the transport of N protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleolus was not dependent on the shuttle protein NPM1 in this study (Fig. 5 and Video S3 in the Supplementary materials). One possible reason is that the N protein may bind to importin \u03b1 and importin \u03b2; both play essential roles in the nuclear transport of proteins through the nuclear pore complex.

With few exceptions, most studies of virus-encoded antiapoptotic proteins have focused on DNA viruses. The known exceptions are the picornavirus-encoded proteins leader and 2BC6263, as well as the rubella virus capsid protein64. Although infection with these viruses induces apoptosis in many cell lines, this is generally observed late in the infection process.
