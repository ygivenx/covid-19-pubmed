MERS-CoV is an enveloped, single stranded positive sense RNA virus belonging to lineage C betacoronavirus. It was first isolated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from a patient with acute pneumonia who subsequently died of renal failure in September 2012 [2,3]. Although MERS-CoV was suspected primarily as zoonotic in origin butanimal to human transmission is not fully understood yet [4]. Human-to-human transmission has been documented in several clusters among health-care providers and contacts [5\u20138]. Since 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1841 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases including 652 deaths from 28 countries[9]. All reported cases had an epidemiological link either directly or indirectly and around 80% of the cases were reported from KSA [10,11].The crude case fatality rate was 35% and males more than 60 years of age having underlying co-morbid condition are at higher risk of developing life threatening severe disease following MERS-CoV infection[9,12].",

Elderly pilgrims with different underlying medical conditions and socioeconomic backgrounds from different parts of the world come in close contact during religious rituals in a closely defined area, most likely increasing susceptibility to respiratory tract infection[12,14,15]. More than 30% of pilgrims from Bangladesh are over 60 years of age [16]. Movement of these huge numbers of returning pilgrims might pose a potential risk of transmitting MERS-CoV in Bangladesh and other countries across the world. Taking all these into account, the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee advised strengthening MERS-CoV surveillance capacities to ensure timely reporting of any identified cases in countries with returning pilgrims [17]. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) under the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) is mandated to lead outbreak investigations, surveillance and disease containment in the country, hence responsible for MERS-CoV screening in pilgrims/ travelers returning from the Middle East with respiratory illness (S1 Text).",

Similar findings were observed among pilgrims from France in 2013[23]. The data from National Influenza Surveillance Bangladesh (NISB) revealed that, in the last five years the overall prevalence of influenza virus infection is 11%. Data also shows that the influenza season in Bangladesh starts in April and ends in September with peak in June-July [24]. However, the seasonality of influenza infection in KSA is different, beginning in September and peaking in November-December[25]. During this study period the Hajj was in the month of September and October. In the last four years pilgrims from Bangladesh received influenza vaccine recommended for Southern Hemisphere, as Northern Hemisphere vaccine is not available during that time. It is documented that influenza infection among vaccinated pilgrims is very common and may be due to mismatch strains[26]. This hypothesis, thus supports the higher prevalence of influenza infection among vaccinated Bangladeshi pilgrims in this study.",
