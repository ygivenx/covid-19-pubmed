Among them, formulating vaccines with an adjuvant typically increases vaccine efficiency. The adjuvant can recruit antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, or stabilize the vaccine. Recently, newer adjuvants have been developed to increase vaccine efficacy, especially for peptide-based vaccines [4,5,6,7]. Besides, some adjuvants are under development, such as the toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, which also induces innate immune responses (a prerequisite for an effective vaccine) [4,8]. Since the discovery of adjuvants, peptide-based vaccines, subunit vaccines, and conjugated vaccines using protein antigens have been co-administered with adjuvants [6,7].",

In the United States, only five adjuvants have been approved: Alum, AS04, MF59, AS01, and CpG 1018 [6,9]. Among them, alum was approved as an adjuvant for use in humans and the squalene-based adjuvants MF59 and AS03 were approved in Europe and the USA for use with influenza vaccines [6,10,11,12]. However, alum mainly induces Th2-type immune responses and does not induce cell-mediated immune responses. MF59 is an excellent adjuvant for inducing antibody production against antigens, but poorly induces cell-mediated immune responses [9,10,11]. Moreover, the fact that these adjuvants are \u201clicensed\u201d does not mean that they are entirely safe. In case of the alum adjuvant, problems with autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome) have been found, such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and chronic fatigue syndrome [13]. Squalene-based adjuvants such as MF59 and AS03 are known to cause chronic arthritis in rats [14] or to induce lupus-related anti-nRNP/Sm/Su antibodies in mice [15]. Therefore, although the first consideration when developing an adjuvant is increased immunogenicity, the most crucial consideration is the safety of the adjuvant.",

            "text": "Immune cells in humans facilitate specific immune responses to infection with different pathogenic bacteria or viruses, but they have receptors to respond to conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns associated with bacterial cell walls, lipopolysaccharide, proteins, or viral RNA/DNA [16]. These receptors are known as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). TLRs are typical PRRs, and TLR agonists highly activate innate immune responses. Thus, TLR agonists are being developed as vaccine adjuvants [16]. Most TLR ligands activate antigen presentation by macrophages, promote DC maturation, and upregulate MHC class 2, which in turn induces T cell responses [17,18]. Among several TLR agonists, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can induce innate immune responses via TLR-3 [19], making it is an excellent TLR-based adjuvant candidate. For example, poly I:C, a representative dsRNA, was tested as an adjuvant [20]. However, poly I:C induced systemically massive cytokine release (i.e., a cytokine storm), and the resulting excessive immune responses could finally lead to adverse effects [21,22]. Furthermore, poly ICLC, which is a poly I:C derivative, can cause severe pulmonary pathology [23]. Moreover, it has been shown that dsRNA can aggravate renal function [24]. In addition, since the immunological effect differed depending on the length of poly I:C, making standardization difficult, poly I:C is unsuitable for use as an adjuvant, even though it was capable of highly inducing immune responses [25].",

Recently, the German biotech company CureVac AG has tested ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant formulations with disulfide-cross-linked cationic carrier peptides, CR12C [27,33] although ssRNA has not been clinically approved as an adjuvant. In addition, many researchers have been intensively studying the potential use of ssRNA as a vaccine adjuvant [34,35,36]. For instance, Lou et al. [34] have found that ssRNA nanocomplex adjuvant showed to be efficient at targeting lymph nodes and inducing Th1-type immunity. Edwards et al. [35] have identified the consistent adjuvant effects of a sequence-engineered mRNA vaccine, both in vitro human and in vivo mouse models. Heidenreich et al. [36] have demonstrated strong immunostimulatory capacities of a novel RNA-based adjuvant. Considering that ssRNA nano-structure adjuvants might be eventually applied for use with prophylactic vaccines, the safety issue is especially important.",

Among them, we selected RNA derived from the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the intergenic region (IGR) of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) as an ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant, because it can express the desired gene in vivo and in vitro [37] and can elicit strong immune responses (including innate immune responses) through Th1-type immune responses [38,39]. Immunizing mice and non-human primates with CrPV IGR IRES-derived ssRNA and protein-based vaccine showed increased production of antibodies, including IgG1 (indicating Th2 responses) and IgG2 (indicating Th1 responses), and neutralizing antibodies [39,40]. Moreover, we previously found that the CrPV IGR IRES-derived ssRNA was clustered as a 25-nm sized nano-structure by atomic force microscopy [40]. Although it has been well documented that the ssRNA nano-structure can function as an immune stimulator, its safety has not been intensively studied. In this study, we verified the safety of a new ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant in a variety of ways. Herein, we present both the general toxicity profile and immunological-toxicity results in mice.",

Groups 1\u20135 were sacrificed 1 day after the last immunization. Also, we investigated group 6 recovery for another 2 weeks after the last immunization to assess long-lasting, delayed, or reversible toxic effects according to the guideline [41].

Previously, we injected mice with 20 \u03bcg of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant to increase immune responses [39].

The ssRNA did not affect cell viability at any concentration tested in tumor cell lines (Figure S2A,B) and normal human cell lines (Figure 2). However, poly I:C as positive control showed some toxicity in the normal cell line (Figure 2). Furthermore, poly I:C induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokines than those of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant in RAW 264.7 cells, which are a mouse macrophage cell line (Figure S3, detailed in supplementary methods), indicating poly I:C may stimulate a stronger inflammation response compared to that of the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant.",

Moreover, ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant showed a synergistic effect with alum to increase humoral and cellular immune responses [39]. Although alum is popularly used as an adjuvant for human clinical vaccines, it usually induces a profound Th2 response (humoral immune response) along with producing antibody, whereas it cannot stimulate Th1 response (cellular immune response) and sometimes triggers autoimmune response [4,39]. These previous results proved that CrPV IGR IRES-derived ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant could function as an ideal vaccine adjuvant to support the weakness of alum. Nonetheless, its safety has not been well investigated yet. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to perform a comprehensive investigation for the general toxicity profile and immunological-toxicity results on the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant.",

Moreover, we also used human normal cell lines to test toxicity because of the toxin resistance of tumor cell lines. As a result, the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not elicit cellular toxicity in all tested cell lines, even with increasing ssRNA concentrations of up to 10-fold higher than we used to increase immune responses previously (20 \u03bcg/mouse) [39]. To overcome the limitation of the in vitro study, we confirmed the general toxicity and immunological toxicity of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant in vivo. Our data indicate that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant formulated with the MERS S protein did not cause any treatment-related significant alteration in clinical condition, growth, or food intake. Since a broad range of toxic injuries beginning with indolent, often asymptomatic, features can progress to organ failure [60], we additionally performed hematological and histological tests to indicate systemic adverse effects of the test materials.",

In other hematological parameters, all treatment groups showed no significant changes within physiologically normal ranges. It indicates that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not affect hematopoiesis and leukopoiesis. In addition, no dose-related significant changes were observed in all serum biochemical parameters tested. No noticeable increases in ALT and AST levels, which are representative of liver toxicity [64], were found among the groups in both males and females. BUN and creatinine levels, which are related to renal function [65], showed little changes in both sexes. A significant difference in a fatty liver marker TG [66] was not considered to be related to its toxicity because this observed change was within acceptable ranges [50,67]. The changes in other markers were sporadic with no concentration-dependency, so these were not considered to reflect toxic changes due to the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant. Importantly, organ weights and histological examinations of major organs such as liver, kidney, lung, spleen, thymus, and intramuscular-injection site did not cause any toxicologically significant changes involved in treatment of the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant. Collectively, in contrast to poly I:C, which causes severe damage to the kidney and spleen [24], the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not induce any organ injury in both males and females.",

MCP-1, which is monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, recruit monocytes during infection to induce inflammation [71]. TNF-\u03b1 induces inflammation and activates lymphocytes and leukocytes [72]. IL-1\u03b2 is produced by monocytes and macrophages and plays an important role in inflammatory regulation [73]. IL-6 promotes the synthesis of acute-phase proteins, such as CRP, and is produced at the site of inflammation [74]. Overexpression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines may cause excessive inflammation or autoimmune diseases [75]. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences in the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 among groups. In particular, the levels of IL-12, which has been associated with autoimmunity [76], were not higher in the ssRNA-treated group than in the PBS-treated group (Figure S4E), supporting the possibility that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not induce autoimmunity, consistent with the data on serum levels of IgE and anti-nuclear antibodies shown in Figure 5. Interestingly, IL-10 levels of ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant groups (G3 to G5) compared with G1 as a control group and G6 as a recovery group was slightly increased (Figure 6). It may be counteracted to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, regardless of no significant increases at 1 day after ssRNA treatment. However, we need further study to reveal the complicated relationship between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after treatment of ssRNA non-structure adjuvant. Taken together, not only were no significant differences found in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels among the groups, but also the IL-10 levels returned to normal levels in the recovery group. These indicate that the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant had no immunological toxicity.",

In contrast, as has been observed with other adjuvants [77], the DC frequencies of the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant-treated groups were higher than those in the control in the spleen, at least partly through the association with higher neutrophil levels in the hematological analysis in vivo toxicity study (Table 1). The increased DC activations found only in the G3\u2013G5 compared with G1 as control group (Figure 7C) were accordance with previous data [39], which showed that ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant transiently triggered DC activation in the injected site. This may have been caused by sacrificing the mice on the first day after the last immunization because DC activation is an early event after vaccine injection [3,78]. The frequencies of DCs in the recovery group returned to levels found in the control group (Figure 7C). Since a short immune duration was observed without toxicological differences in organ weights or histopathology, it is considered that our ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not elicit immunological toxicity. Moreover, in draining lymph nodes, no significant difference occurred between groups in terms of both DCs and macrophages (data not shown). These data indicated that our ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant performed successfully as safe adjuvant.",

In this study, we showed that the adjuvant did not cause weight loss or abnormal behavior in mice after immunization, even at high doses. Moreover, it did not increase any hematological and biochemical parameters and did not change the histopathological patterns compared with the control group. In addition, the ssRNA nano-structure adjuvant did not promote sustained pro-inflammatory cytokines and excess immune cell activation for a long time, as these indicators quickly disappeared after immunization. Instead, our results appeared to reflect an effective \u2018hit-and-run\u2019 strategy for stimulating immune responses. Therefore, the ssRNA nano-structure can function as a safe adjuvant with high vaccine efficacy.",
