In acute settings, the pericardium does not have time to increase its compliance, leading to a rapid decline in cardiac output.",

Acute presentations of tamponade can occur within minutes or hours, as is typically seen in trauma, aortic rupture, or iatrogenic result from an invasive procedure. Acute presentations frequently result in life-threatening hypotension necessitating immediate interventions to decrease the pericardial pressure.10 In contrast, the subacute presentations can occur over days to weeks and hypotension is relatively uncommon.4,11 One study demonstrated that 27\u201343% of patients presenting with subacute cardiac tamponade are actually hypertensive, with systolic blood pressures ranging from 127 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) to 144 mmHg, likely secondary to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system.11,12 Clinical findings of tamponade can vary, and no sensitive or specific signs have been identified.13 Findings may include tachycardia, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, tachypnea, hypotension, hypertension, and pericardial rub. The classic presentation of Beck\u2019s triad, characterized by hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds, is seen only in a small number of acute cardiac tamponade cases.14",

While each method has its advantages, our patient underwent surgical pericardiectomy. This procedure allows the clinician to obtain pericardial biopsies for further evaluation, which was an important consideration in this patient given her history of recurrent effusions. For our patient, analysis of the fluid and subsequent rheumatologic and malignant workups were negative. Interestingly, the patient tested negative for the most common etiologies of tamponade.
