Killed vaccines are weakly immunogenic and MLVs has the potential revert to high virulence212223. DNA vaccines are the third revolution in the vaccine field, and have been found to be safe to the host while generating both humoral and cellular immunity2425. Moreover, DNA vaccines can be easily modified to enhance the poor immunogenicity. Adjuvants including immunopotentiator and delivery systems were necessary for the development of DNA vaccines. In order to increase the efficiency of the PRRSV vaccines, they were modified with immunopotentiators, including HSP7026, IL-188, GM-CSF27, CD40L28, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides2930, IL-231, CTLA432 and interferon \u03b1/\u03b233. Furthermore, delivery systems were also applied to the design of PRRSV vaccines, for example, viral vectors343536, chitosan2537 and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)38394041. In our previous studies, an immunopotentiator (PoIFN-\u03bb1) and delivery system (BPEI/PLGA) were applied to modify pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 constructs, based on the HP-PRRSV JSKM strain. We demonstrated that both formulations of DNA vaccine could improve the immunogenicity of pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 in a mouse model. Thus, in this study, we chose to evaluate the immune response induced following inoculation of piglets with the two DNA vaccine formulations to establish an attractive candidate vaccine against HP-PRRSV. To our knowledge this is the first report of a comparative efficacy test of two formulations of adjuvants (immunopotentiator and delivery system) used to modify a PRRSV DNA vaccine in pigs.",

The results presented showed that all pigs in the control group showed more severe clinical signs than the vaccinated groups. Rectal temperatures of all test groups were coincident with the viremia detected by real-time RT-PCR. No obvious clinical signs or pathological changes could be observed in the groups inoculated with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 or JXA1-R. Given these observations, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 may provide more effective protection for pigs, although the viremia could not be fully prevented after virus challenge. Although virus could still be detected in the tissues of all pigs at the end of the experiment, viral loads in the heart, liver, lung, kidney, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric lymph node from pigs in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 group were significantly lower than those from the PBS group, which indicates that piglets inoculated with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 can successfully restrict viral replication in tissues. Moreover, a ten-fold reduction in viral RNA load could be observed in the lungs of animals immunized with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 compared with the PBS control group.",

Moreover, there are reports of reversion of vaccine virus into virulence leading to severe disease outbreaks, and like the field virus, PRRS-MLV also induces immunosuppression. However, DNA vaccine, without reversion to high virulence, was safe to the host while generating both humoral and cellular immunity and could be easily modified with immunopotentiator and delivery systems. The constructs of PRRSV with the potential to induce immunosuppression could be avoided when designing PRRSV DNA vaccine. Based on our current results, we can also modify pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 by inserting PRRSV ORF3 and ORF6, with the potential to induce protective immune responses.",

The method of adsorption would protect antigens from this limitation. Furthermore, BPEI was utilized to modify the PLGA nanoparticle in order to improve the efficiency of adsorption. Compared with other DNA vaccine of PRRSV such as pCA-U-optiGP59, pcDNA-5L6, pcDNA-6L547, and pVAX1-EU-ORF3-ORF537, BPEI modified PLGA nanoparticles could improve the delivery of adsorbed DNA into antigen-presenting cells after i.m. injection. Although these DNA vaccines could enhance the immune response, they didn\u2019t provide enough protection after challenge. It is believed that adsorption of the DNA vaccine on BPEI/PLGA allows it to be presented in particulate form, which appears to be more antigenic and can be efficiently phagocytosed48.",

Both the pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 formulations induced enhanced immune responses compared with the parent construct pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, and provided protection against challenge with HP-PRRSV JSKM strains. BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 elicited the strongest responses and thus may provide the most efficient protection against PRRSV infection among the parent construct pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-\u03bb1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5. And BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 may represent promising candidate vaccines against PRRSV.",
