Essential oils (EOs) are volatile, natural, complex compounds isolated from natural plant materials (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, root, and stem). EOs have a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-microbial [1,2,3], antiviral [4] and anti-inflammatory effects [5]. Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (H. cordata) injection, in which EO is the main active compound, is widely used to treat respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, keratitis, acute, chronic rhinitis, and sinusitis in traditional Chinese medicine therapy. Moreover, H. cordata injection was recognized as the formula for the prevention of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by the Health Ministry of China during the outbreak of the SARS epidemic [6]. However, the H. cordata injection was suspended for its severe adverse drug reactions (ADR), such as breathing problems, high fever, rash, anaphylactic shock, and even sudden death by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2006.",

The volatile compounds include houttuynin (3-oxododecanal, Hou, Figure 1), 2-undecanone, pinene, camphene, myrcene, limonene, and so on, among which Hou is the main active compound [11]. However, it was reported that the Hou content in the injection was especially low (<1%, and even undetectable) [12]. Studies that investigated the relationship between ADR and Hou content showed that Hou is easily destroyed (oxidation, polymerization, or condensation reaction) by the high temperature during the hydrodistillation extraction due to its poor stability [13,14]. In addition, our group found that degradation products of Hou showed serious acute toxicity, which would induce ADR. H. cordata injection can also cause hemolysis, which may result from impurities of HEO or Tween 80 in the formulation [15,16]. Additonally, impurities (vegetable proteins, peptide polysaccharides, and tannins) in HEO may stimulate the immune system to produce ADR-like allergic reactions [15]. Therefore, a facile and comprehensive approach to avoid the occurrence of ADR is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Xue et al. reported that solvent extraction performed at room temperature is highly efficient to extract Hou-riched HEO [17]. Compared to the hydrodistillation extraction, the mild solvent extraction condition can avoid the destruction of Hou. However, they did not study the safety and activity of the extract. In addition, impurities in the extract were not removed, which were not conducive to the safety of the product. Therefore, purification is especially needed to remove impurities and further improve the safety and activity. However, to our knowledge, there is no study reported on purification of essential oil from H. cordata. Generally, liquid\u2013liquid extraction [18], fractionation [19], and silica gel column chromatography [20] are used for purification of natural products. Unfortunately, these extraction procedures are inefficient, costly, time and solvent consuming, and labor intensive [21]. In addition, it is very difficult to enrich the essential oil due to its extremely low polarity and stability. Comparatively, macroporous resins (MRs) have unique advantageous adsorption properties due to the ideal pore structure and various surface functional groups available on these resins [22,23]. They are durable nonpolar, middle-polar, and polar macroporous polymers and have been successfully applied for the separation of flavonoids [24,25], saponins [26,27] and alkaloids [28] from traditional Chinese medicine or herbs. Moreover, MRs are relatively low-cost and easily regenerated, which is especially important for industrial applications.",

Table 1 showed the levels of each factor which would affect the extraction ratio of HEO. In Table 2, ki was the mean extraction ratio of the corresponding level of each factor and R was the range of the ki of each factor [30,31]. The parameter of ki was used for judging the optimal level of each factor while R was used for judging the effect of the factors. The results indicated that the optimized extraction condition was A2 (factor A level 2)/B3/C3/D2 and the effect of the factors was D > A > B > C. Therefore, sufficient extraction solvents with proper polarity could easily infiltrate to the herbs thereby improve the extraction efficiency. Additionally, ultrasonic time could improve the extraction efficiency and feasible extraction time and root length were beneficial for the penetration of solvent. Overall, the optimized extraction condition was as follows: the ultrasonic time was 20 min (A2), the extraction time was three days (B3), the H. cordata root length was 1.0 cm (C3), and the solid-liquid ratio was 1/1.5 (kg/L, D2). Using the optimized extraction condition, the HEO extraction ratio was 0.171% (wt %) and the Hou content in the extract was 8.80% (wt %) based on the GC analysis. Moreover, the extract was treated by alcohol sinking and n-hexane extraction to prepare the crude HEO (Hou 15.0%) for MR purification.",

HPD100 had the highest adsorption capacity of 11.16 mg/g owing to its relative high surface area. As for desorption ratios, D101 resin showed the highest desorption ratio (74.9%) and was significantly higher than AB-8 and HPD100.

The fast adsorption process of D101 resin in the first 30 min was due to the high diffusivity of Hou into macropores of the resin and the slow adsorption process 30 min later was because of its high transfer resistance into macropores. The result indicated that Hou exhibited a fast adsorption feature on D101 resin and 3 h was appropriate as the adsorption time.",

The dynamic breakthrough curve on D101 resin was obtained according to the volume of loading sample and the Hou concentration of the leak solution. As shown in Figure 3C, the Hou concentration in the exit solute was very low before 7 bed volume (BV) at the sample flow rate of 6 BV/h, which suggested that Hou was almost completely absorbed by D101 resin. Subsequently, the Hou concentration increased rapidly in the leak solution until it reacheed a steady plateau at 14 BV.

Briefly, mice were intravenously injected with Hou at the dose of 30 mg/kg and observed for toxic symptoms and mortality. As shown in Table 5, blank Tween 80 solution and blank ME had no effect on mice. HEHEO exhibited significant acute toxicity such as tachypnea, jitter, skip, ataxia, and tic, though no death occurred. For the crude HEO group, nine of the 10 treated mice died after administration from severe toxicity, such as tachypnea, dyspnea, tic, and fainting. For the pure HEO group, the mice showed tachypnea, ataxia and recovered within 3 min without death. However, there were no obvious reactions observed in the HME group. Therefore, we concluded that purification by D101 resin decreased the toxicity of HEO and ME encapsulation further improved its safety. In addition, the results indicated that the impurities in the crude HEO were seriously toxic and the purification by D101 resin could effectively remove the toxic impurities in the crude extract.",

As shown in Table 6, HEHEO exhibited weak activity against CVB3 with IC50 of 17.24 \u00b5g/mL. For the extracts prepared by solvent extraction, pure HEO (Hou 46.6%) showed significant antiviral activity with IC50 of 7.41 \u00b5g/mL while the crude HEO (Hou 15.0%) showed relatively weak activities (IC50 > 15 \u00b5g/mL). This indicated that the solvent extraction following purification by D101 resin largely increased the content of Hou and, thus, improved the antiviral activity of HEO. Furthermore, the IC50 of HME was 0.35 \u00b5g/mL and SI was no less than 519.5 on CBV6. It is worth mentioning that the SI of HME was at least 100 times higher than that of the pure HEO without ME encapsulation. The largely increased SI indicated that ME encapsulation could simultaneously improve the safety and antiviral activity. The reasons could be explained as follows: HEO was wrapped in the inner oil phase and was controlled and sustained release to the virus by the shell of HME, which prolonged the action time and, thus, improved the activity. Additionally, the biodegradable and biocompatible shell (composed of phospholipids and Poloxamer 188) avoided the contact of HEO with Vero cells effectively, thereby greatly reducing the toxicity of HEO (TC50 > 181.82 \u00b5g/mL) [38]. Furthermore, it was reported that nanocarriers with inherent immunogenic properties would improve its activity [39].",

The spectrophotometric reading was taken at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). 5Fifty percent (50%) toxic concentration (TC50) was defined as the concentration that inhibited 50% cellular growth in comparison with the untreated controls and calculated using the Reed-Muench method.",

Briefly, cells were plated into 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. The medium was then removed and cells were infected with virus for 2 h. Samples with different various concentrations (HEHEO, crude HEO, pure HEO, and HME) were added to each well immediately and incubated until the CPE of the control group cells reached 4. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined using the Reed-Muench method. The selective index (SI) was calculated from the ratio of TC50/IC50.",

To further improve its safety and antiviral activity, the pure HEO was encapsulated into ME and then comprehensively characterized. The safety evaluation tests and in vitro antiviral test indicated that the safety and antiviral activity of HEO were largely improved after purification by D101 resin and were further improved by ME encapsulation. These results indicated that purification of HEO using D101 resin, followed by ME encapsulation, was of high efficiency, reduced toxicity, and enhanced effect, which was very promising for future therapy of antiviral and infectious diseases. Hou, the major active constituent of HEO, possesses a quite simple chemical structure and high antiviral activities. This is straightforward to evaluate its usefulness as a pure compound in the future.",
