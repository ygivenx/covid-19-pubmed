We also included a viral pathogen grouping variable and interaction terms between BMI and viral pathogen group. The interaction terms allowed us to determine whether there were different effects in BMI for the different pathogen groups. This model showed that, in adults, the relationship between BMI and severity was significantly different for the influenza cohort (P < 0.0001) when compared to the virus\u2010negative cohort, while the relationship between BMI and severity was not significantly different in the virus\u2010negative and NIRV cohort. Therefore, separate logistic regression analyses were performed for the influenza cohort while the participants in the virus\u2010negative and NIRV cohorts were analyzed together in one larger group. In both groups, underweight and morbidly obese participants had more severe disease than normal\u2010weight participants. In both of those body mass categories, the effect was larger in the influenza\u2010positive group compared with the combined NIRV and virus\u2010negative group. Underweight adult participants with influenza were 5.2 (P < 0.005) times more likely to develop severe ILI, while their influenza\u2010negative counterparts had an OR of 2.88 (P < 0.001) (Table 2). In morbidly obese adults, these numbers were 18.4 (P < 0.001) and 1.89 (P < 0.001), respectively.

No participants with other viral co\u2010infections were included in this strain\u2010specific analysis. The initial logistic regression model examined interactions between influenza strains and BMI.

The five most common respiratory viruses were coronavirus, metapneumovirus, PIV, RSV, and rhinovirus/enterovirus. The same multiple logistic regression analysis was performed as previously described. In this analysis, only participants with a single virus were included. The interaction analysis indicated a significantly (P < 0.0054) different effect for the relationship between BMI and severity in the RSV group with the BMI/severity effect being similar among the other viruses. Therefore, a separate analysis was performed for the RSV group, while the participants with other viruses were combined for the analysis. In the combined group, underweight and morbidly obese participants were at higher risk of severe disease than normal\u2010weight participants. For the RSV participants, only obese participants (OR: 6.33, P = 0.019) were at higher risk than normal participants. (Table 3)",

Despite the large confidence intervals, the data seem to indicate that the association between morbid obesity and risk of severe ILI is not just statistically significant in adults with influenza A/H1N1 pdm 2009. A statistically significant OR was also found in participants with influenza H3N2 and B. While the association was also present for these strains of influenza, the odds ratio was six times higher in influenza H1N1 participants (OR: 35.13 vs 5.58), which may explain why individuals with H1N1 were the first in which the association between body mass and disease severity was postulated. However, influenza H3N2 and influenza B still have twice the risk of hospitalization as the other most common respiratory viruses. Preclinical data suggest reduced vaccine efficacy in obesity,24, 25 and while the increased risk does not seem to be due to reduced antibody titers,26, 27 it may be from reduced cellular immunity.28 However, this would not explain the differential risk of H1N1 over H3N2, nor of all influenza over other respiratory viruses.",
