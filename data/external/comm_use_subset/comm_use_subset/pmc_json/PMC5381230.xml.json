            "text": "We first developed the assay using Ang II as the substrate to form Ang-(1-7). The new method involves a series of four reactions using synthetic Ang II as the starting substrate. The Ang-II-converting activity is measured as the production rate of L-phenylalanine (Phe) following proteolytic cleavage of the Pro7-Phe8 peptide bond at the carboxyl terminus (the schematics of the reaction is in Fig. 1). In the first reaction, Ang II is allowed to react with purified converting enzymes (such as ACE2) or with tissue lysate, in which Ang II to Ang-(1-7) conversion releases the carboxyl terminal Phe8 (Fig. 1A). In a coupled reaction, the exposed primary amine (-NH2) group of phenylalanine amino acid is hydrolyzed by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) of Rhodotorula glutinis and ultimately turns on a fluorescent probe (Fig. 1B). For illustrative purposes, the color conversion - visible to naked eyes - following the reactions is shown in Fig. 1C. Typically, the reaction sets are operated in a 96-well format and either dynamic or endpoint reading of fluorescence excitation intensity is automated (details in Methods).",

Among them is apelin-13, a peptide also cleaved by ACE230. ACE2 can cleave the peptide bond preceding Phe77\n31 causing inactivation of apelin32. A potent stimulator of cardiac contractility, apelin exists in a number of active polypeptide forms: apelin-13 (aa 65\u201377), apelin-17 (aa 61-77) and apelin-36 (aa 42\u201377), all carry the dipeptide motif at their carboxy termini and are expected to react with ACE2. We therefore asked whether the new phenylalanine assay can also be adapted to measuring carboxypeptidase activities that degrades apelin-13 (see below).",

We sought to determine the dynamic performance of the assay in dose-response studies (Fig. 2). Eight reactions with two-fold serially diluted rsACE2 were monitored for over 60 minutes in presence of phenylalanine assay regents (Fig. 2A\u2013B). With the same amount of substrate in each reaction, both Ang II and apelin-13 gave similar results (A compared to B), showing that the reaction conditions had allowed complete dose separation in each series. The results also showed that relative fluorescence intensity reached a plateau within 30 min in the highest ACE2 groups (Fig. 2A\u2013B). Therefore, we used 30 min as the optimized first-step reaction time for the following two-steps phenylalanine assays (details in Methods).",

The substrate-fluorescence dependent curve was derived using non-linear regression (Fig. 2C,D). Then, we performed phenylalanine assay to calculate the kinetic parameters for rsACE2 by measuring the catalysis rate against Ang II and apelin-13, respectively. The Km value of rsACE2 for Ang II was 20.48 \u03bcM and that for apelin-13 was 23.23 \u03bcM. The Vmax value for Ang II was 2.164 nmol/min/ug protein and for apelin-13 was 2.459 nmol/min/ug protein (Fig. 2C,D).

Because the system produces virtually no background signals, as low as 0.25 ng of the enzyme could still be sensitively detected (Fig. 3A and B). Good linear ranges for ACE2 activity were obtained from 0.25 to 4 ng on a non-logerithmic scale with R2 = 0.9955 for Ang II and R2 = 0.9968 for apelin-13, and from 4 ng to 100 ng on a logarithmic scale with R2 = 0.9946 for Ang II and R2 = 0.9971 for apelin-13 (supplementary Figure S2A\u2013D).",

Both methods measured ACE2 activities that not only correlated with the input concentrations of the enzyme, but also highly correlated to each other (R2 of 0.9958, Fig. 3C). Here we should emphasize that the two substrates are of rather distinct sequences (Fig. 3D), and Mca-APK(Dnp), which sequence was originally designated for caspase 1, as a surrogate can be cross-recognized by ACE234. Therefore, the ACE2 specific inhibitor MLN-4760 are used in conjunction with MCA-APK(Dnp) to measure activity exclusively attributed to ACE233. Instead, the phenylalanine assay, measures either ACE2-dependent or combined total converting activities against Ang II when used in presence or absence of this ACE2 inhibitor, respectively.",

As previously reported by us and others333637, there is minimal serum ACE2 activity measured for Mca-APK(Dnp) (Fig. 5C). By contrast, by using a large volume of mouse serum (5 \u03bcL) we detected converting peptidase activities comparable to that of 5 ng rsACE2 as measured by the phenylalanine assay using Ang II and apelin-13 peptides (Fig. 5D and E respectively). These results suggest that Ang-(1-7) formation from Ang II in serum is to a large extent ACE2-independent, although this converting activity is relative low and might be undetectable as reported by others using other methods that used a small amount of serum15. Carboxypeptidases reacting to Ang II and apelin-13 other than ACE2 contribute therefore to total phenylalanine intensity (particularly at the tissue level) (see below).",

First, we conducted control experiments to determine the background levels of the assay from two contributing sources: The naturally existing phenylalanine in tissues and phenylalanine resulted from non-Ang II substrates such as abundant tissue proteins. Using mouse kidney lysate, even without Ang II substrate, there was a background level of phenylalanine reading likely from endogenous phenylalanine. As the reaction proceeded with Ang II, the reading of phenylalanine levels increases steadily over time (supplementary Fig. S1A). This is in stark contrast to the reaction that maintained a constant intensity of phenylalanine signal when Ang II was absent, suggesting that reaction signals were derived from Ang II-conversion, instead from any protein substrates in tissue lysate. Endogenous phenylalanine levels tend to vary (up to 2 mg/dL in blood) depending on diet. We next performed desalting of the lysate to remove endogenous phenylalanine (details in Methods) and then subjected the resulting tissue lysates to phenylalanine assay (no Ang II added to the reactions). As expected, desalting reduced background intensities in a majority of mouse tissues tested, most notably in serum (supplementary Fig. S1B). Therefore, we adapted this desalting step in tissue preparation in subsequent experiments. The assay can equally be performed without the step but then it requires subtraction from baseline phenylalanine activity.",

By contrast, phenylalanine was stably produced throughout the course of the 120 min reaction (Fig. 6A). Evidently, the net Ang-(1-7) levels were influenced by the rates of its formation and degradation, and the commonly used EIA method may not truly represent Ang-(1-7) formation activity.

Even with the best setting, the dynamic range is less than one order of magnitude, as opposed to the three orders of magnitude range achieved by the Ang II phenylalanine assay (Figs 2 and 3). The clinical importance of the RAAS in a multitude of diseases underscores the need for techniques to measure enzymatic activities in biological samples, such as blood and tissues. The new method could have broad applications for analyzing biological and clinical samples. For instance, when used with pure enzymes including those known to have Ang II converting activities, such as prolylcarboxypeptidase (PrCP)4445, prolylendopeptidase (PEP/PrEP)46, alongside ACE2, it may provide meaningful comparison of kinetic parameters as well as tissue specific distribution and activity of these carboxypeptidases. Furthermore, since we demonstrated that the assay is also suited for analyzing serum and tissue lysates, potential applications of the technique to clinical samples are possible. The sample volume required for the test is diminutive which makes it feasible for both research and clinical use.

However, the broad-specificity of these inhibitors may also compromise the effort on finding physiologically relevant converting enzymes that might be sensitive to inhibition. In contrast, the phenylalanine approach measures the levels of stable amino acid of phenylalanine, and therefore was used in the absence of general protease inhibitors. Still, we should note the caveats of the new assay. The phenylalanine results likely reflect the combined enzyme activities attributing to phenylalanine formation, including but not limited to Ang II to Ang-(1-7) conversion. For instance, concurrent proteolytic cleavage of Ang II peptide by additional enzymes might happen prior to the release of phenylalanine. Therefore, the new method, when used in conjunction with a selected combinations of specific peptidase inhibitors, may be pursued in the future towards better delineating in vivo Ang II to Ang-(1-7)-converting enzymes.",
