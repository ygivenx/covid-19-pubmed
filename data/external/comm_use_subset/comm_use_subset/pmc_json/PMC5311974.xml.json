However, as we attempt to provide a comparative picture, we have taken the fraction i.e., divided the numbers by the total population Np for each country. One can easily see that the comparative trends become different in the two different approaches (Fig. 1). The disease is seen to affect the least fraction of the population in Guinea and the maximum in Liberia. However, the number of cases is maximum for Sierra Leone and not for Liberia. Considering the time at which the data reach a saturation value, one can also conclude that the disease has existed over a longer period in the case of Sierra Leone and Guinea.",

Here the agents have two nearest neighbour connections and a random long range connection to a agent located at a distance l with probability l\u2212\u03b4 (details given in the Methods Section). The parameter \u03b4 essentially controls the network structure and the other parameter is of course the infection probability q.

Rescaling R(t) such that it varies from 0 to 1, one can find out the goodness of fit. We performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to evaluate the goodness of the fit for all the three sets of data. The values are: 1.1294 for Guinea (sample size Ns = 217), 1.1070 for Sierra Leone (Ns = 235) and 1.4959 for Liberia (Ns = 233).

The peak value is slightly less in height for the green curve compared to the red which is also consistent with the real data (up to a multiplicative factor) if one takes the single spike occurring in Fig. 2(c) inset to be spurious. The data for Fig. 2(a) inset is easily comparable to the red curve in Fig. 3(b).

The mismatch of the tp values is not surprising, unit of time in the model is just one Monte Carlo (MC) time step that has got nothing to do with real time. On the other hand, the saturation values depend heavily on the normalization factor. The actual population who are susceptible may form only a subset of the total population so saturation values can be different changing the values of a and c. Nevertheless, we find that the ratio of of a/c from the data and from the model for Sierra Leone and Liberia are very close which indicates that the fractions of susceptible population in these two countries were comparable while for Guinea it was smaller.

Taking Rs(t) to be the saturation value of R(t) obtained from the model and equating it to the saturation value of R(t) obtained from the real data, one can estimate the value of \u03c1. For example, for Guinea, the saturation value of R(t) is 0.000328 from the data and from the model it is 0.354720. Hence . Similarly for Sierra Leone and Liberia it is 3.27 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 3.58 \u00d7 10\u22123 respectively. On the other hand, one can compare the tp values from real data and the model and we find that the timescales in the real data are approximately 8\u20139.2 times the timescales in the Monte Carlo simulations. Hence we also rescale the time for the results obtained for the model. The rescaled data Rs(t) and R(t) are plotted against \u201creal time\u201d in Fig. 4 and show an excellent agreement for Guinea and a reasonably good agreement for Sierra Leone. The agreement for Liberia is not that good, however, the data for Liberia are somewhat irregular and it is difficult to fit them with a smooth function very accurately as already noted. Particularly for Liberia and Sierra Leone we find that before saturation, there is a slower increase in R(t); this might be due to an enhancement in the treatment and preventive measures against the disease.",

Sierra Leone and Liberia are comparable in size but the density of population is much higher in the former. The density of population is 79.4/km2 and 40.43/km2 respectively for these two countries29. Hence the number of neighbours within the same distance is larger for Sierra Leone which implies a larger value of \u03b4 effectively (more short ranged).",

However, we need to justify why a smaller value of q is able to reproduce the data for Guinea. A smaller value of q indicates less infection probability which is possible if proper medical care and control measurements are taken. This is indeed true as we find from several documents that the disease was tackled most effectively in Guinea. Table 3 clearly shows that the maximum percentage of cases for Guinea were laboratory-tested which indicates that the process of contact tracing and treatment were more efficient. This is supported by the fact that in Guinea, about 56 contacts per infected person were traced compared to 23 in case of Sierra Leone31. We find from ref. 32 that MSF treated the largest number of reported cases in Guinea, in Sierra Leone the minimum out of reported cases. Thus most cases in Sierra Leone, even when reported, had received less attention while in Liberia, a large number is not confirmed or reported at all. Apparently, medical centers by international organisations have also been set up much earlier in Guinea as it was the epicenter of the disease and the disease started as early as in 2013 December. However, later activities could control the disease in Liberia and Sierra Leone as well, and the final number of deaths had been far less than initially anticipated. We also note a curious fact - though Guinea may have recorded the minimum number of cases, yet the disease spanned a longer duration compared to Liberia. Further analysis, beyond the scope of the present paper, may be able to explain this.",

The ratio of the saturation values for the real data and the simulated data corresponds to the factor \u03c1. In principle one should incorporate more factors in the model to fit the real data independently. However, at the present stage qualitative consistency is what we emphasize on. To achieve quantitative consistency one needs to introduce more parameters making the model complex. These parameters may be related to features like inhomogeneity, mobility, more general initial conditions to name a few. We have made simple assumptions like homogeneity, i.e., uniform number of contacts for all agents. The initial condition has been taken to be identical: the disease commences with only one infected person. Our assumption that agents are immobile is supported by ref. 27 in which it is argued that migration did not play a role in the spreading. Even so, this simple model is able to yield data which is consistent with real data and we conclude that it captures the basic mechanism of the epidemic spread. The effect of the Ebola outbreak has been devastating in the West African countries. Apart from the human losses, economic loss has also been considerable33. The present study shows that the Euclidean model can be treated as a basic starting point and can be further developed by adding other features. This will make it very useful and important for making accurate predictions.",

The data is noisy and contains obvious errors as sometimes the cumulative data is shown to decrease which is unphysical. The first available data is from March 2014 when Guinea was already struck with the disease for some time (first case in Guinea reported in December 2013) such that the data for the initial period is missing. For Liberia and Sierra Leone, the data for initial stage are available, however these are sparse and unreliable; often the data for number of death exceeds the number of cases. For this reason, the data has been analysed from the date when the number of cases detected is at least 50 for each country. Even then the errors cannot be fully avoided as for very late stages, the data being rare, also become somewhat unreliable. Hence, the entire data set has to be handled carefully.",

The disease spreading process is then simulated by assuming a single infected agent at any randomly chosen site in the beginning. All the neighbours are likely to be infected with a probability q in the next step. One generates a random number between 0 and 1, if it is less than q, the agent is taken to be infected. From the agents who are infected in the second step, the disease spreads to their neighbours and the process continues. Infected people are removed within one unit of time, with the assumption that they are either dead or cured, and they can infect the susceptible agents during this one time step only.
