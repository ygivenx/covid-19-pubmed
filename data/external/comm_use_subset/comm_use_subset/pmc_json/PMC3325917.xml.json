            "text": "The caliciviruses are a family of small non-enveloped viruses, and can be classified into five genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus and Nebovirus. They possess a non-segmented, polyadenylated, positive-sense ssRNA genome of about 7.5 to 8.5 kb in length, enclosed in an icosahedral capsid of 27 to 40 nm in diameter. Among them, noroviruses and sapoviruses (SaVs) are well known to cause enteric disease in a range of mammals, including humans, while vesiviruses and lagoviruses cause systemic diseases in specific animal hosts. Nebovirus is the most recently established genus in the family Caliciviridae\n[1], and its members are associated with enteric diseases in cattle [2], [3]. A putative sixth genus, Recovirus, has been proposed for a novel calicivirus detected in stool specimens from rhesus monkeys [4], [5]. Another new genus, Valovirus, has been proposed for a novel group of swine caliciviruses known as the St-Val\u00e9rien-like viruses [6]. In addition, there exist other unclassified caliciviruses, such as the recently described chicken calicivirus [7].",

The SaV genome is approximately 7.1 to 7.5 kb in length, and may have two or three ORFs. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form the non-structural proteins and the major capsid protein VP1. ORF2 encodes the minor structural protein VP2. ORF3 encodes a small basic protein of unknown function [9], [10]. Interestingly, it is located in an overlapping reading frame within ORF1, and is present only in SaVs from selected genogroups. At present, SaVs are classified formally into 5 genogroups based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length VP1 sequence, though additional genogroups have been proposed to accommodate some novel SaVs discovered in recent years. Further classification of SaVs into genotypes has also been undertaken, though taxonomic assignment at the genotype level appears to be less well-defined than at the genogroup level [11].",

The genetic diversity of SaVs is comparable to that of noroviruses, and the diversity of reported animal hosts is also similar. Noroviruses have been discovered in specimens from humans, pigs, cattle, dogs, sea lions, African lion, and mice [22]\u2013[25].

The polyprotein contains characteristic amino acid motifs conserved in caliciviruses: 2C-like NTPase at residue 482 (GPPGIGKT), VPg at residues 958 (KGKTK) and 972 (SEYEE), 3C-like protease at residue 1183 (GDCG), 3D-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase at residues 1520 (GLPSG) and 1568 (YGDD), and VP1 at residue 1867 (PPG). It undergoes proteolytic processing to produce the nonstructural viral proteins and the major capsid protein VP1. Based on comparison with the ORF1 cleavage map of SaV/Mc10 [37], [38], a human SaV GII strain, we predicted the cleavage site that generates the major capsid protein to be located between residues 1740 (E) and 1741 (G). An in-frame AUG start codon is located in a favourable context for translation initiation (GUGUUUGUGAUGGA) just upstream to the cleavage site, which has also been reported in other caliciviruses [6], [39]. This sequence is noted to be similar to the 5\u2032 UTR of the genome, and it was postulated that the site might permit internal translation initiation from subgenomic RNA [39]. The sequence identities of the bat SaV/TLC58 with other SaVs in the complete ORF1 protein sequence vary between 36.0% and 37.4% (Table 3). While comparison with caliciviruses of other genera, the ORF1 sequence identities are overall lower (15.6%\u201322.8%) than those between different SaVs (Table S2). For individual alignment of protease \u2013 polymerase, sequence identities with other SaVs (45.3%\u201348.4%) are overall higher than those with other genera (22.7%\u201332.1%) (Table 3 and Table S2). The VP1 is predicted to be 546 aa long, and has a molecular mass of 56.6 kDa. It shares 36.1% to 39.2% amino acid identities with VP1 of other SaVs (Table 3). Likewise analysis with caliciviruses of other genera reveals lower similarities with 14.9% to 23.4% sequence identities (Table S2).",

Lastly, the genome organization of the bat SaV is highly similar to that of the SaVs as shown above.

As a case in point, the proposed assignment of the novel bat virus to the genus Sapovirus might be opposed on the basis of an increased genomic G+C content, the different reading frame of ORF2, and the increased length of the 3\u2032 UTR. On the other hand, the polythetic criteria for inclusion in the genus are not fully clear, and phylogenetic distances between viral gene sequences have assumed overriding importance in previous and current classifications.

Most caliciviruses have a genomic G+C content of 44.2\u201357.4 mol%. Among them, the genomic G+C content of the SaVs lie within the relatively narrow range of 49.0\u201353.6 mol% in spite of their genetic diversity. Hence, the presently observed G+C genomic content of 60.2% is significantly higher than that for other SaVs or caliciviruses, and indeed would rank amongst mammalian RNA viruses with the highest G+C genomic content [43]. Relatively little is known about the evolution of genome composition in caliciviruses. A number of factors have been postulated to exert selectional pressure on the G+C content of viral genomes, including host body temperature, immune pressure, codon and nucleotide usage patterns [44]\u2013[47]. Our results suggested that the increased G+C content is associated with a decrease in CpG suppression, but does not have a direct correlation with codon usage bias. We are unaware of any previous findings indicating that genomes of bat viruses are under less CpG suppression, thus the observed reduction in CpG suppresion is unlikely to result from host-related factors. The greater codon usage bias in the bat SaV genome is another interesting genome feature, which could be associated with altered dinucleotide frequencies. The association could be tested by Markov modelling of the dinucleotide and codon frequencies in the SaV genomes, although the small genome sizes and the presently small number of complete genomes would limit the usefulness of this approach [48].",

Although this \u201chomology-based\u201d strategy has been successful in the discovery of numerous viruses, the advent of affordable high-density microarrays and high-thoughput sequencing has given rise to virus discovery through metagenomics. Indeed, the first canine SaVs were discovered recently by metagenome sequencing of canine diarrhoea samples on a high-throughput pyrosequencer [23]. Important advantages of the new method include detection of novel viruses not closely related to known viruses, and the capacity to detect multiple divergent viruses in cases of co-infection. However, metagenomics sequencing can suffer from possible bias during sample preparation [49], and it is unlikely to detect very low titres of viruses in a specimen, such as the three bat faecal samples that were positive upon repeat screening with specific PCR primers in the present study. While we anticipate the increasing utilization of the metagenomics approach, existing methods such as viral culture, electron microscopy and targeted nucleic acid amplification would continue to serve important roles in virus discovery.",

            "text": "There are two main limitations in the current study. First and foremost, clinical information on the sampled bats is limited to the brief period of captivity needed for sample collection, which is unlikely to reflect the disease association of the virus accurately. In other words, the scope of the study is limited to surveillance of viral diversity and possible discovery of new viruses. Secondly, the number of samples for the novel virus is quite small, despite the use of specific PCR primers for screening and the relatively large number of samples collected. Thus, we were unable to draw conclusions on the seasonality of its detection or its host specificity. To address these limitations, long-term follow-up studies would be required to identify sufficient positive samples with associated clinical data. Increasing the scale of surveillance would also help, though there are practical geographical and logistic constraints in our locality.",

For CpG dinucleotide bias analysis, odds ratio of CpG and GpC dinucleotides and the CpG/GpC ratio were calculated as described in previous studies [40], [41]. Odds ratio of \u22640.78 indicates significant suppression of the dinucleotide, same as the interpretation criteria of previous studies. Symmetrized nucleotide frequencies and dinucleotide odds ratio were not considered in the present study, as SaV genomes consist of positive-sense ssRNA only. To investigate the possible effects of cytosine deamination, genomic GC skew, which is the ratio (G-C)/(G+C), was calculated for the SaV genomes. The strength of the GC skew had been suggested to correlate with the degree of cytosine deamination [41], [44], [62].",
