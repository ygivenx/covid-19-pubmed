            "text": "Adenoviruses, first isolated in the 1950s from explanted adenoid tissue, are double-stranded nonenveloped DNA viruses that naturally infect many vertebrates, including humans and nonhuman primates. The human adenoviruses in the Mastadenovirus genus, comprised of all mammalian adenoviruses, are classified into 7 species A-G, and at least 51 different serotypes (and 5 proposed types, HAdV-52 to HAdV-56) have been described to date [1], [2]. Adenoviruses are the cause of an estimated 5\u201310% of febrile illnesses in children worldwide [3]. Some serotypes, such as human adenovirus type 14 (HAdV-14), have been associated with severe and potentially fatal outbreaks of pneumonia in residential facilities and military bases [4]. Adenoviruses have also been associated with other clinical syndromes including conjunctivitis, hepatitis, and diarrhea [5]. In nonhuman primates, most epidemiologic studies of adenoviruses have focused on their identification in fecal samples from asymptomatic animals [6], [7], [8]. Overt respiratory disease associated with simian adenoviruses has also been observed [9]. Although adenoviruses are significant pathogens, genetically modified strains are being actively explored as potential vectors for vaccines and gene therapy [10].",

Human adenoviruses do not usually replicate in monkey cells in the absence of helper viruses [11], and do not productively infect rodents (and vice versa) [12]. Studies of sera from animal handlers and zoo workers exposed to chimpanzees in captivity fail to detect antibodies to chimpanzee adenoviruses [13], [14]. However, recent serological surveys have found antibodies to New World and Old World monkey adenoviruses in donor human sera from regions where the monkeys are endemic [14], [15]. In addition, phylogenetic analyses of adenoviruses from greater apes reveal that they fall precisely into \u201chuman\u201d adenoviral species B, C, and E [7]. The high degree of sequence relatedness within members of each species suggests that at least some adenoviral strains may be capable of infecting both nonhuman primates and humans.",

Routine microbiological testing for an infectious etiology was negative. We previously developed the Virochip (University of California, San Francisco) as a broad-spectrum surveillance assay for identifying viral causes of unknown acute and chronic illnesses [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. The Virochip, a pan-viral microarray containing \u223c19,000 probes derived from all viral species in GenBank (n\u223c2500) [21], [23], has been previously successful in detection of novel outbreak viruses such as the SARS coronavirus [22], [24] and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus [23]. Here we apply the Virochip to identify a novel and highly divergent adenovirus as the cause of the titi monkey outbreak. In addition, we present clinical and serological evidence that this virus may have infected a researcher at the CNPRC and a family member, thus demonstrating for the first time the potential for cross-species infection by adenoviruses.",

The index case, a healthy adult titi monkey, presented on May 14, 2009 with cough, lethargy, and decreased appetite (Fig. 1A, T1). Despite aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, the animal developed severe respiratory distress and was humanely euthanized 5 days later. A second case presented 4 weeks later near the entrance to the building (Fig. 1A, T54). In the interim period, 3 healthy titi monkeys had been relocated from a separate building (Fig. 1A, T2, T3, and T19), with 2 of the 3 monkeys placed into the cage formerly occupied by the index case, reflecting a total at-risk population of 68. Over the ensuing 2 months, 21 additional monkeys, including one of the relocated monkeys, presented with clinical signs similar to those shown by the index case (attack rate  = 23/68, or 34%) (Figs. 1A and 1B). Clinical signs in affected animals included cough, lethargy, poor appetite, tachypnea, and abdominal breathing. These symptoms progressed to overt respiratory distress and death or humane euthanasia within an average of 8 days. Chest radiographs typically revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary changes and bronchoalveolar consolidation indicative of pneumonia, with right middle lobe predominance (Fig. 1C). Animals displaying clinical signs were quarantined and aggressively treated by veterinarians with supplemental oxygen, anti-inflammatory medications, bronchodilators (nebulized albuterol), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antivirals (oseltamivir and/or ribavirin). In total, 19 animals died or were euthanized due to the illness during the outbreak (case fatality rate  = 19/23, or 83%). Only 4 monkeys survived, even though the majority of sick animals (17/23, or 74%) consisted of apparently healthy adults and juveniles. Interestingly, none of the 133 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) housed in the same building became sick during the outbreak, and neither did any of the Old World monkeys from surrounding outdoor colonies of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis).",

Microarrays were analyzed using ranked Z-scores to assess the highest-intensity viral probes [18]. From a lung swab sample from an affected monkey, 4 of the top 80 probes on the Virochip corresponded to adenoviruses. Other viruses or viral families with \u22654 probes among the top 80, including chimpanzee herpesvirus (Herpesviridae), bovine viral diarrhea virus (Flaviviridae), and endogenous retroviruses (Retroviridae), were regarded as less likely to cause fulminant pneumonia and hepatitis, so were not pursued any further. The 4 adenovirus probes mapped to 2 different gene regions corresponding to the DNA polymerase and penton base (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the 4 viral probes were derived from 2 different Adenoviridae genera (SAdV-23, simian adenovirus 23, PAdV-A, porcine adenovirus A, and HAdV-5, human adenovirus 5, in the Mastadenovirus genus; FAdV-D, fowl adenovirus D, in the Aviadenovirus genus), suggesting the presence of a divergent adenovirus that was not a member of any previously known species.",

In addition, nasal swabs were negative in 3 asymptomatic, minimal-risk titi monkeys housed in a separate building.

De novo assembly of the complete TMAdV genome from reads that aligned to SAdV-18 was not possible due to insufficient sequence coverage (<46%). The poor apparent coverage was the result of high sequence divergence of the TMAdV genome from SAdV-18, which hindered the identification of most of the 16,524 actual deep sequencing reads derived from TMAdV (Fig. 2B, red). Thus, after partial assembly of TMAdV using overlapping reads aligning to the SAdV-18 genome, remaining gaps were closed by specific PCR. The complete genome of TMAdV was found to be 36,842 base pairs in length, with a base composition of 20.8% A, 29.8% C, 29.8% G, and 19.6% T, and a GC content of 59.6%, comparable to that of adenoviral species Groups C, D, and E in the Mastadenovirus genus.

The closest human adenoviral relatives were the species D adenoviruses, which share 54.3% to 55.1% identity to TMAdV, with human adenoviruses of other species slightly less similar (51.1%\u201354.6%). The placement of TMAdV into a separate group by phylogenetic analysis was also observed when looking individually at the hexon, polymerase, penton base, and fiber genes (Fig. S1). Scanning nucleotide pairwise identity plots revealed that, among the major adenovirus genes, the DNA polymerase and hexon are more conserved, whereas the E1A and fiber are more divergent (Fig. 4). The significant overall sequence divergence of TMAdV from known human and simian adenoviruses is highlighted by the finding that PAdV-A (porcine adenovirus A), a non- primate mammalian adenovirus, shared only a slightly less similar whole-genome pairwise identity to TMAdV of 47.0% (Fig. 4). In fact, in the DNA polymerase gene, TMAdV shared a pairwise identity with PAdV-A of 67.2%, comparable to its pairwise identities with the other human adenoviruses, 59%\u201371.7% (Figs. 4 and S1).

Despite the absence of an animal model, which precludes a strict fulfillment of Koch's postulates, there are several lines of evidence implicating this novel adenovirus, TMAdV, as the cause of the outbreak. First, conventional testing for other pathogens, including other viruses by Virochip, was negative, and affected monkeys did not respond to empiric therapy with antibiotics or antivirals (ribavirin and oseltamivir in anecdotal use are not effective against adenoviral infections) [30]. Second, the clinical presentation of pneumonia and hepatitis is consistent with the known spectrum of disease associated with adenoviral infections. Third, TMAdV sequence was recovered by PCR in various body fluids and tissues from affected monkeys, including blood, respiratory secretions, and lung/liver tissue (Table 1). Fourth, the finding of intranuclear inclusions in diseased tissues, as well as direct visualization of adenoviral-like particles (TMAdV) in lung alveoli by electron microscopy (Figs. 1D-2 to 1D-4), support a primary role for TMAdV in the pathogenesis of tissue injury in affected monkeys. Finally, there was a significant neutralizing Ab response in surviving animals, with 2 monkeys having titers undetectable prior to the outbreak but rising to >1\u2236512 at convalescence (Fig. 6).",

The virus, however, grew efficiently in a human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. One explanation for this finding is that TMAdV may be unable to productively infect cells derived from Old World monkeys (e.g. rhesus and African green monkeys). An alternative possibility is that successful propagation of TMAdV may depend on infection of a specific host cell type, such as A549 lung, and not BSC-1 or PMK kidney cells. Nevertheless, after 10 passages in human A549 cells, the fully adapted strain of TMAdV exhibits an extended host range with the ability to productively infect both monkey and human cells. This observation implies that TMAdV possesses an inherent capacity to cross the species barrier and infect both humans and nonhuman primates. Efforts to identify host range and cell tropism of TMAdV, as well as the specific sequence changes responsible for adaptation to growth in cell culture, are currently underway.",

In humans, deaths due to adenovirus infections or outbreaks are generally low (up to 18% for pneumonia associated with HAdV-14 [4]). Furthermore, severe infections from human adenoviruses are more commonly associated with older age, immunosuppression, and chronic underlying conditions such as kidney failure [4], [41]. Young, healthy individuals are in general much less likely to succumb to adenoviral-related illness. The severity of TMAdV-related illness in affected titi monkeys suggests that this species of monkey may not be the natural host for the virus. The failure to detect fecal shedding of TMAdV in convalescent or asymptomatic animals also suggests that the virus does not normally infect titi monkeys (Table 1).",

One possibility is that a cross-species \u201cjump\u201d from captive macaques to a susceptible colony of titi monkeys precipitated the outbreak. As there have been no new introductions of monkeys into the closed colony for the past 2 years, this conjecture relies on asymptomatic infection and transmission of TMAdV in the captive rhesus/cynomolgus macaque population at the CNPRC. CNPRC personnel who visited macaque areas would occasionally enter titi rooms with no change in personal protective equipment, thus providing a potential route of transmission for the virus. In addition, specific antibodies were detected in 1 of 36 (2.8%) asymptomatic rhesus macaques housed in the same building (Fig. 6), indicating that TMAdV has the capacity to infect this species of Old World monkey. Notably, the closest identified phylogenetic relative to TMAdV among the complete genomic sequences available in GenBank is a rhesus monkey adenovirus, SAdV-3 (Fig. 4; Table 2). Furthermore, serological evidence for cross-species adenoviral transmission events between different nonhuman primate species has been previously reported in the literature [42].",

In this regard, the high sequence divergence of TMAdV relative to the known human/simian adenoviruses (Fig. 3), and comparable sequence similarity in the polymerase gene to a porcine adenovirus (Figs. 3 and S1) are striking. The four-week interval between the index case and the second case appears overly long given a typical incubation period for adenovirus infections of no more than 1 week [43].

Interestingly, pleurisy has been specifically reported in association with certain human adenovirus infections [44]. The clinical presentation, time of illness concurrent with the onset of the outbreak, and presence of neutralizing Abs in convalescent serum all strongly point to primary infection of the researcher by TMAdV. The detection of weakly neutralizing Abs (1\u22368) in a serum sample from a sick family member of the researcher also suggests that TMAdV may be capable of human-to-human transmission. The decreased levels of neutralizing Abs to TMAdV in the researcher (1\u223632) and a family member (1\u22368) relative to those in infected titi monkeys (up to >1\u2236512) are consistent with a recent study showing much higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in chimpanzees than in humans with adenovirus infections, possibly due to more robust adenovirus-specific T-cell responses in humans than in monkeys [45].",

First, the closest known relative to TMAdV in GenBank is SAdV-3, an Old World monkey adenovirus (Fig. 3; Table 2). Second, our results show that PCR assays for human adenoviruses in common use are capable of detecting TMAdV. Although sequencing of PCR amplicons for human adenoviruses is not performed routinely in diagnostic virology, TMAdV would presumably have been detected previously in large-scale studies of hexon sequencing of Ad field isolates if it were circulating in the community [46], [47]. Finally, the available sequence data in GenBank is heavily biased towards human adenoviruses, and much less is known about the potential diversity of the simian adenoviruses. We also cannot formally exclude the possibility that the outbreak arose from anthroponotic transmission. In our study, 2 of 81, or 2.5% of random adult blood donors exhibited borderline titers of neutralizing antibody to TMAdV, indicating either a low prevalence of TMAdV in the human population or cross-reactivity to a related virus (although no evidence of cross-reactivity was found with HAdV serotypes 1 through 35). Future large-scale studies of TMAdV seroepidemiology will be needed to better understand transmission of TMAdV between monkeys and humans. Nevertheless, our discovery of TMAdV, a novel adenovirus with the capacity to cross species barriers, highlights the need to monitor adenoviruses closely for outbreak or even pandemic potential.",

Four probes derived from 2 different Adenoviridae genera (SAdV-23, PAdV-A, HAdV-5, and FAdV-D) yielded an adenovirus signature on the Virochip that was found to be TMAdV. With the exception of SAdV-23, these highly conserved probes are part of the core Virochip design and were derived from all available adenoviral sequences in GenBank as of 2002 [21]. One explanation why more high-intensity probes to simian adenoviruses were not seen by Virochip analysis is that the genomes of many simian Ads, including SAdV-3 and SAdV-18 (the two closest phylogenetic relatives to TMAdV in GenBank), were not sequenced until after 2004 [7], [49], and thus their genomes are not as well-represented on the Virochip microarray.",

Briefly, randomly amplified libraries were cleaved with a Type IIs restriction endonuclease (GsuI) and truncated adapters were ligated on the resulting strand ends. Full-length adapters containing strict 6-nt barcodes were added via an additional 15 cycles of PCR. Amplified libraries were size-selected on a 2% agarose gel at approximately 350 bp average length and then sent to an outside company (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Hayward, CA) for deep sequencing on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Paired-end reads were sequenced for 73 cycles in each direction. Paired-end reads were subsequently filtered to eliminate low-complexity sequences with a Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression ratio below 0.4 [53], split into individual reads, classified by barcode, and stripped of any remaining primer sequences using BLASTN alignments (word size = 11, E-value = 1\u00d710\u22125). After low-complexity filtering and barcode/primer trimming, 11,950,557 sequence reads remained, with each read consisting of 67 nucleotides, for a total of \u223c800 megabases of sequence. Reads were then aligned using BLASTN (word size = 11, E-value = 1\u00d710\u22125) and TBLASTX (word size = 11, E-value = 1\u00d710\u22125) to the genome sequence of SAdV-18 (Fig. 2B). Overlapping reads aligning to SAdV-18 were used to assemble portions of the TMAdV genome with Geneious software (version 3.6.5) [54], employing the SAdV-18 genome as a reference sequence and requiring a 20-bp minimum overlap and 95% overlap identity. Aligning reads were also used to design PCR primers to close remaining gaps in the TMAdV genome. Amplicons derived from specific TMAdV PCR primers were gel-purified, cloned, and sequenced as described above. The 5\u2032 end corresponding to the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) of TMAdV was obtained by PCR using a forward degenerate consensus primer and a reverse TMAdV-specific primer. The 3\u2032 end was recovered using a forward primer near the 3\u2032 end of the genome and a reverse primer derived from 5\u2032-ITR sequence.",

After incubation, 100 \u00b5L of mixture were inoculated into appropriate wells containing 4,000 cells per well and the entire plate was placed in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator. Cells in the plate wells were observed for evidence of CPE every other day for 1 week. For wells that showed inhibition of viral CPE, the corresponding serum samples were diluted in six 2-fold steps and then retested. The reciprocal of the highest dilution that completely inhibited viral CPE was taken as the neutralizing antibody titer.",
