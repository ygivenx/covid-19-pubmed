            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major animal and public health concern given the zoonotic nature of IAV (1\u20133). As a natural host to IAV, research on IAV in swine has relevance to both human and animal medicine. IAV is a segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The surface glycoproteins, hemaggluttinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are used to type IAV, and currently H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 viruses circulate in pigs in the United States (4, 5). There are a large number of IAV H1 and H3 genetic and antigenic variants co-circulating, and continued antigenic drift and shift of circulating viruses has made control of IAV in swine very difficult (5). Live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccination in swine has been shown to provide cross-protection against heterologous IAV of the same subtype, and partial protection against different subtypes [reviewed in Sandbulte et al. (6)]. LAIV is licensed for use in humans and was recently approved for use in swine, with numerous experimental studies documenting improved efficacy of LAIV over inactivated vaccines (7, 8). Several LAIV vaccines for use in swine have been developed; each with a different attenuation mechanism (9\u201311). Similar to humans, intranasal LAIV vaccination in pigs induces the production of IAV-specific mucosal IgA, but little peripheral IAV-specific IgG (8). The induction of immunity in the respiratory tract has been shown to be the mechanism by which LAIV vaccines provide significant cross-protection against heterologous strains of IAV, limiting viral replication throughout the respiratory tract [reviewed in Rose et al. (12)].",

Respiratory disease associated with B. bronchiseptica covers a wide spectrum, including kennel cough in dogs and atrophic rhinitis in pigs (13, 14). In humans, B. pertussis infection can lead to whooping cough, though colonization without clinical presentation has been documented (15, 16). Similarly, B. bronchiseptica exposure to pigs can result in chronic, asymptomatic colonization of the respiratory tract and it is believed to be ubiquitous in swine production systems. Co-infection with IAV or coronavirus and B. bronchiseptica in pigs causes exacerbated pulmonary disease, indicating the negative impact of B. bronchiseptica colonization with viral infection (17, 18). Bordetella species encode for a number of virulence factors, including tracheal cytotoxin, dermonecrotic toxin, lipopolysaccharide, and a type III secretion system (19). While the gene locus controlling expression of many virulence factors, including the type III secretion system, has been highly investigated, factors that alter expression of virulence genes in vivo are not completely understood (20, 21).",

The commensal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract includes bacterial species in which colonization alone does not lead to clinical disease, but upon a stressful event (i.e., viral infection, immunosuppression) these bacteria play a major role in disease pathogenesis, often referred to as pathobionts. Administration of LAIV vaccine induces changes in the nasal microbiota and gene expression in nasal epithelium. In addition, LAIV administration alters colonization dynamics of important bacterial pathogens (23). Given the ubiquitous nature of B. bronchiseptica in swine and the documented increase in disease following B. bronchiseptica with IAV co-infection, we performed a study to determine if B. bronchiseptica colonization prior to LAIV vaccination altered LAIV immunogenicity and efficacy against heterologous IAV challenge, or the dynamics of B. bronchiseptica colonization.",

Pregnant sows were transferred to the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) approximately 2 weeks prior to their farrowing due date from a herd negative for IAV-specific antibody and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Piglets were early weaned from sows at approximately 10 days of age to reduce vertical transmission of bacterial respiratory pathogens colonizing the sow to the piglets. Piglets were transferred to individual isolation rooms based on treatment, with piglets from each litter represented in each treatment group (Table 1). Nasal swabs were collected from piglets prior to any inoculation and neither IAV nor B. bronchiseptica were isolated. At 2 weeks of age, piglets in groups 4-6 were inoculated with B. bronchiseptica (Bb) by the intranasal (IN) route, and this was considered day\u22127 of the experiment. Seven days later when piglets were 3 weeks of age, animals in groups 3 and 6 were inoculated with LAIV by the IN route and this was considered day 0 of the study. A second dose of LAIV was administered on study day 21 (3 weeks post-LAIV priming). Nasal swabs were collected on day\u22127 (Bb inoculation), day 0 (immediately prior to LAIV administration) and days 1\u20133 for evaluation of Bb nasal colonization following LAIV vaccination. Nasal washes were collected on days 7, 21 (immediately prior to LAIV boost), 28 (1 week post-boost), and 42 for evaluation of Bb nasal colonization and IAV-specific mucosal antibody titers. Blood was collected on day\u22127 and 42 for serum isolation to evaluate antibody titers. On day 42, pigs in groups 2, 3, 5, and 6 were challenged with heterologous IAV by the IN route. Nasal swabs were collected every day, for 5 days, following IAV challenge for evaluation of IAV titers in the nose. On day post-infection (dpi) 5, pigs were euthanized with a lethal dose of pentobarbital and necropsy performed.",

IAV-specific IgA was detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-swine IgA (1:2,000 dilution; clone Bethyl Laboratories). IAV-specific IgA endpoint titers were determined by titrating samples two-fold in duplicate before performing the ELISA. The optical density (OD) data was modeled as a nonlinear function of the Log10 dilution using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad software Inc, La Jolla, CA) log (agonist) vs. response-variable slope four-parameter logistic model. Endpoints were interpolated by using 2X the average OD of the nasal wash samples from non-vaccinated controls as the cutoff.",

MCP-1 levels were significantly increased in non-vaccinated group that were colonized with Bb and challenged with IAV over non-vaccinated and IAV infected pigs, suggesting Bb co-infection led to enhanced MCP-1 production. IL-1\u03b2 levels were increased in lungs of Bb/NV/NCh pigs over control pigs; however, IL-1\u03b2 levels in Bb/NV/NCh pigs were not significantly different than levels of the other B. bronchiseptica colonized groups (Bb/NV/NCh and Bb/LAIV/Ch).

The majority, if not all, of experimental challenge studies in swine with LAIV use pigs that have been procured from high health status herds that are free of many of the bacteria that can be pathogenic under some conditions (i.e., pathobiont) and associated with secondary disease in commercial settings. These bacteria include, but are not limited to, Bordetella, Mycoplasma, Haemophilus and Streptococcus, which are also associated with the respiratory disease complex, a multifactorial disease in which infectious agents, environment, and management practices play a role in susceptibility (37). Much like B. pertussis in humans, B. bronchiseptica in pigs can be isolated from the respiratory tract without evidence of pathology or clinical disease. However, B. bronchiseptica has been shown to cause significant disease when pigs are co-infected with other respiratory viruses, including IAV (17, 18). Inflammation resulting from epithelial and immune cell changes following IAV infection suppresses antibacterial immune mechanisms such that bacterial dynamics and infection severity is impacted [reviewed in Smith and Mccullers (38), Robinson et al. (39)]. LAIV vaccination provides protection against IAV infection, which results in a reduction of secondary bacterial pneumonia (40, 41) and may limit antibiotic usage. However, intranasal administration of LAIV vaccine can alter commensal replication and colonization, though these changes are limited to the upper respiratory tract (23, 42, 43). In the current study, LAIV administration had minimal effect, if any, on B. bronchiseptica density in the upper respiratory tract and we did not appreciate any signs of clinical disease following LAIV administration (data not shown). At day 42 after LAIV administration, which was 49 days after Bb inoculation, there was a significant difference in the amount of Bb in the nasal passages of Bb/NV and Bb/LAIV pigs. However, this could be due to commonly measured shifts in Bb nasal colonization around 7 weeks post-inoculation (25, 26), which is not uncommon. Given that no other changes in Bb colonization following LAIV administration were detected, we do not expect the difference was due to LAIV administration, though it cannot be completely ruled out. It is possible that LAIV administration altered the overall bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract of pigs, though additional studies are needed to assess such changes.",

Thus, as previously shown (8), we anticipated some replication of the challenge virus even in the LAIV vaccinated groups but limited detection in the lower respiratory tract by dpi 5.

Although B. bronchiseptica encodes a number of immunomodulatory proteins (47\u201349), its presence at the time of LAIV administration did not impair induction of mucosal IgA to IAV. We expect LAIV induced the production of mucosal IAV-specific T cells, which has been shown in other species (50); but, the impact of B. bronchiseptica colonization on IAV-specific T cell development is unknown. Although IAV-specific IgA was induced in the upper respiratory tract of pigs following LAIV vaccination during B. bronchiseptica colonization, it was unable to provide full protection upon IAV challenge in the face of B. bronchiseptica infection. Thus, LAIV vaccine based immunity could not protect against the negative interaction that occurred with IAV/B. bronchiseptica co-infection. B. bronchiseptica has a sophisticated environmental sensing system (Bvg locus) that drives expression of numerous virulence factors (51), including unique regulatory system controlling expression in the lower respiratory tract (52). There was minimal pathology in the lungs on Bb-only pigs (Bb/NV/NCh), and lesions present were characteristic of chronic B. bronchiseptica infection, suggesting that virulence gene expression so long after initial B. bronchiseptica inoculation was minimal. However, environmental changes in the respiratory tract associated with IAV infection, such as epithelial damage and/or altered abundance of soluble immune mediators (cytokines, defensins), or leakage of serum proteins into the airway may have subsequently altered B. bronchiseptica gene expression such that cytotoxic factors were produced. Bordetella exposure to albumin enhances production of adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) (53), and ACT disrupts bronchial epithelial integrity (54). Enhanced expression of B. bronchiseptica virulence factors likely contributed to the appearance of lesions associated with acute B. bronchiseptica infection. The limited replication of challenge virus in LAIV vaccinates also colonized with B. bronchiseptica (Bb/LAIV/Ch) appeared to be enough to incite pulmonary lesions commonly associated with acute B. bronchiseptica infection. Lesion characteristics associated with acute B. bronchiseptica infection were noted in both Bb/NV/Ch and Bb/LAIV/Ch groups, but not the Bb/NV/NCh group. Pathologic changes were not due to an increase in bacterial burden (Figure 4), which has been an ascribed pathologic interaction by other commensal organisms following IAV infection (55), nor significant increases in proinflammatory cytokine levels. Only recently has B. bronchiseptica gene expression in vivo been evaluated (56), and future work aimed at identifying factors that alter gene expression may provide insight on the mechanism by which B. bronchiseptica plays a role in secondary disease.",

            "text": "Mucosal cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses play a role in IAV cross-protection (57, 58), though this was not directly assessed in the current study. B. bronchiseptica may have altered the induction of cell-mediated immunity in the lungs of LAIV vaccinated pigs, though this is unlikely given that IAV-specific IgA was produced and class switching to IgA requires CD4 T cell help. Histologic changes in the lungs of pigs in the LAIV/Ch and Bb/LAIV/Ch group, but not NV/Ch group, consisted of peribronchiolar lymphocyte cuffing and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), indicating that LAIV likely induced a CMI response in the lungs regardless of B. bronchiseptica colonization. Again, changes in the respiratory tract associated with IAV/B. bronchiseptica co-infection, regardless of vaccine status, may hinder immune-protection. It's possible that if the vaccine and challenge antigen were more closely related, such that the LAIV vaccine provided sterilizing immunity against challenge, there would not have been an induction of acute Bordetellosis in the Bb/LAIV/Ch group, though further investigation is necessary to test this hypothesis. Overall, LAIV administration provided significant protection against a distantly related strain of IAV by substantially decreasing replication of the virus in the respiratory tract. Thus, the data presented do not negate the efficacy of LAIV vaccination, but instead indicate that controlling B. bronchiseptica colonization in swine could limit the negative interaction between IAV and Bordetella on swine health.",
