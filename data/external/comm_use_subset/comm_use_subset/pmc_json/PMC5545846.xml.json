            "text": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting systemic inflammation that can involve multiple organs, especially the heart via coronary artery lesions (CALs) [1]. KD is a newly appeared disease in the East Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China; though infantile polyarteritis nodosa, which may be a severe form of KD, has been reported in the Western countries since the late nineteenth century [2]. KD began being reported in Asian countries in specific time periods: in the early 1960s in Japan, 1970s in Korea and in 1970\u201380s in Taiwan and China, and possibly 1990s in India and other economically grown Asian countries [3\u20137], which suggests that economic growth and westernization of these countries are associated with the emergence of KD [8, 9]. KD has shown epidemiological characteristics in these countries; it has the same age predilection of 6 months-4 years and has become a nationwide endemic disease within 2 decades with the incidence slowly increasing after its first report. Additionally, KD occurs throughout the year with slight monthly and regional variations. On the other hand, the incidence of KD in Western countries is lower by tenth to one twentieth to Asian countries and has plateaued during recent decades [10]. These unique epidemiological characteristics are not observed in any newly emerging infectious diseases, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thus, it is proposed that KD may be an acute immune-mediated disease that develops after an infection with an unknown pathogen(s) in genetically susceptible immune-immature young children, and that the immunopathogenesis of KD may be similar to that of infection-related immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever rather than that of infectious disease such as scarlet fever [9].",

Nationwide epidemiological studies in Japan and Korea have reported that the epidemiology of KD has also changed over time, including increased incomplete KD and less severe CALs in recent patients compared to past KD patients [14, 15]. We also independently observed similar results in neighboring hospitals in Daejeon, Korea, which suggests that KD in recent patients has a milder phenotype compared to that in past KD patients [16, 17].",

In incomplete KD patients (n = 228), 149 patients had 3 diagnostic signs, and 79 patients had \u22642 diagnostic signs (5 patients had one sign of lymphadenopathy). IVIG treatment for incomplete KD was based on laboratory indices; incomplete KD patients in the 2000\u20132004 group, before the 2004 AHA guidelines were published, had WBC count of >10,000/mm3, neutrophil differential of >50%, and CRP level of >2 mg/dL in the early stage of the illness with repeated examinations, and they showed an increased platelet count at follow-up examination after IVIG treatment [16, 19]. Diagnosis and IVIG treatment of incomplete KD patients in the 2010\u20132014 group were referred to the AHA guidelines [1]. All patients received IVIG (2 g/kg) for 10\u201312 h, and the mean duration from admission day to IVIG infusion day was 1.2 \u00b1 0.9 days.

Nationwide epidemiological studies have indicated that the proportion of patients with incomplete KD was as high as 20% in 2007\u20132008 in Japan [23], and 42.2% of patients in 2009\u20132011 in Korea with no fatalities [15]. In this study, we confirmed this trend as well as in our previous studies [16, 17], the proportion of incomplete KD significantly increased from 26.4% in 2000\u20132004 to 46.2% in 2010\u20132014. In the present study, we found that incomplete KD patients had fewer cases of repeated IVIG treatment (5.7% vs. 11.9%, P = 0.015) and less severe values of some laboratory indices such as WBC differentials, CRP, albumin and ALT, but the rate of CALs in the incomplete KD patients was not different from that in complete KD patients (20.2% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.75) (Table 1). Other studies have also indicated that incomplete KD and complete KD patients had similar laboratory findings with similar incidences of CALs [24, 25]. These findings suggest that KD may appear as various phenotypes and immune responses against KD pathogen(s) and/or insults from the infection are similar in both KD patient groups, with individual variations such as involvement of ALT/ALT elevation and CALs. Thus, our results suggest that patients with incomplete KD may have milder clinical manifestations with less systemic inflammation reflected by some laboratory parameters compared to patients with complete KD. As for incomplete KD patients, Pediatricians in Korea have skillfully used other signs such as skin changes at the Bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin inoculation site for infants or slit lamp examination to search the anterior uveitis for older children [26, 27], as well as laboratory findings.",
