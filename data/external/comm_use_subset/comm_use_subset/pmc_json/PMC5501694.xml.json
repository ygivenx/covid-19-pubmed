Helicases unwind DNA or RNA duplexes in an NTP hydrolysis dependent manner. They are classified into six superfamilies SF1-SF6 and participate in almost every aspect of nucleic acid metabolism[19]. Regardless of their functional diversity, helicases all contain core domains that hydrolyze NTPs. The enzymatic core is formed either by the tandem RecA-like domains within the same polypeptide chain (SF1-SF2 superfamilies) or between subunits of the functional oligomer of the helicase (SF3-SF6 superfamilies) [16]. The universal features of the RecA-like domain includes a Walker A motif forming the phosphate binding loop (P-loop), a Walker B motif coordinating magnesium and an \u201carginine finger\u201d engaging \u03b3-phosphate of ATP[18,20,21]. In addition to the core domains, helicases also have accessory domains or inserts with various functions, such as assisting the catalytic activity or the interacting with other protein partner [16,17,22].",

Nidovirus helicases share many structural features with the eukaryotic Upf1 helicase, a key factor in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in cells[24,25]. Upf1 is a multi-domain protein comprising of an N-terminal Cys-His-rich domain (CH domain) coordinating three zinc atoms, a 1B domain with the \u03b2-barrel fold and a conserved SF1 helicase core with a 1C insert in the first RecA-like domain[24,26]. The crystal structure of nsp10 from equine arteritis virus (EAV) of Arterovirus genus is the first high-resolution structure of nidovirus helicase. EAV nsp10 has an N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD) that is followed by the 1B and a SF1 helicase core, but it lacks the 1C insert. The ZBD of nsp10 coordinates two zinc ions by an N-terminal RING-like module and one zinc ion by a C-terminal treble-clef zinc finger. The 1B domain of nsp10 undergoes large conformational change upon substrate binding, and 1B together with the 1A and 2A domains of the helicase core form a channel that accommodates the single stranded nucleic acids. The CH domain of Upf1 mediates the binding with Upf2[26]. Similarly, the ZBD of nsp10 harbors a putative protein interaction surface, of which the binding partner remains to be identified[25]. The structural resemblance between Upf1 and EAV nsp10 suggests that nidovirus helicase may be involved in the posttranscriptional quality control of the viral RNAs.",

            "text": "CoV helicase is one of the three evolutionary most conserved proteins in nidoviruses[27], thus making it an important target for drug development[28]. Previous biochemical characterizations have shown that CoV nsp13 exhibits multiple enzymatic activities, which include hydrolysis of NTPs and dNTPs, unwinding of DNA and RNA duplexes with 5\u2019-3\u2019 directionality and the RNA 5\u2019-triphosphatase activity[29,30]. Additionally, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP, nsp12) of CoV physically interacts with nsp13 and enhances its unwinding activity[31]. Although the molecular mechanism underlying these activities and the role of nsp13 in viral RNA synthesis are poorly understood, mutagenesis studies have identified a collection of residues important for the activity of nidovirus helicase. Disruption of the zinc binding function of 229E-CoV nsp13 or EAV nsp10 by replacing the conserved Cys/His residues at ZBD or deleting the entire zinc binding domain interfere with the ATPase activity of the helicases. Moreover, the activity of nsp10 is not complemented by providing wild-type ZBD in trans[32]. These results suggest that ZBD of nidovirus helicase modulates the ATPase/helicase activity in cis. CoVs nsp13 is essential for virus replication. ATPase/helicase deficient mutations of nsp13 (either at the zinc-binding site or the Walker A motif) can lead to the abolition of CoV replication. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) M protein and nsp13 are required for efficient replication An A335V mutation in the helicase core of nsp13 causes the attenuation of MHV replication both in vitro and in vivo [33].",

To verify that the recombinant protein is enzymatically active we first performed ATPase assay. The purified nsp13 exhibited ATPase activity with a turnover number (kcat) of 2.03 \u00b10.1 s-1 and the catalytic efficiency (kcat\nKm-1) of 0.32 \u03bcM-1 s-1 (Fig 1B). The ATPase activity of MERS-CoV nsp13 is comparable with that reported for SARS nsp13[29]. Next, we assessed helicase activity of the recombinant nsp13. Partial RNA duplex containing 5\u2019 overhang was fully unwound by the purified nsp13. By contrast, MERS-CoV nsp13 could not unwind RNA duplex containing 3\u2019 overhang (the duplex region remained the same as the RNA duplex with 5\u2019 overhang). These results confirm that MERS-CoV nsp13 is a unidirectional helicase with the unwinding polarity of 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 (Fig 1C, left). Mutant with E375Q within Walker B failed to unwind the RNA substrate with 5\u2019 overhang clearly indicating that the helicase activity of MERS-CoV nsp13 is dependent on ATP hydrolysis (Fig 1C, left). MERS-CoV nsp13 was able to hydrolyze different NTPs and dNTPs to support the unwinding of RNA substrate, with a clear preference towards ATP (Fig 1C, right). Our results are consistent with the recent enzymatic characterization of the MERS-CoV nsp13 expressed in bacteria[30].",

Benefiting from the presence of an N-terminal zinc-binding domain, we collected highly redundant multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data at the zinc absorption edge and subsequently solved the structure. Next, we collected a 3.0\u00c5 resolution native dataset, which we used for final structure refinement and further analysis. There are two nsp13 in the asymmetric unit (ASU) with three zinc ions bound to each N-terminal Cys/His rich domain. Unexpectedly, no additional electron density for ppp-15T DNA could be identified, indicating that a stable nsp13-DNA complex did not form. The final model of nsp13 has good stereochemistry quality.

We compared the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 with all structures in Protein Data Bank using Dali server. The top hits were human Upf1 helicase[24] (hUpf1 PDB code: 2GK7; Dali Z-score: 22.7) and arterivirus (EAV) helicase[25] (PDB code: 4N0N; Dali Z-score: 22.2).

A long loop (88-100aa, between \u03b28-\u03b12) spanning across the entire height of CH domain connects zinc coordination modules. The first zinc (Zn1) is coordinated within a CCCC type treble-clef zinc finger with four cysteine ligands (Cys5, Cys8 Cys26 and Cys29) (Fig 3B). Cys5 and Cys8 are located on a zinc knuckle between \u03b21-\u03b22 strands, whereas Cys26 and Cys29 are placed in the N-terminal region of \u03b11 helix. The second zinc (Zn2) is coordinated by a two-Cys, two-His (C2H2) zinc finger motif. The cysteine ligands (Cys16 and Cys19) are forming part of a zinc knuckle between \u03b23-\u03b24 strands, while histidine ligands His33 and His39 are located on \u03b11 helix and the loop between \u03b11 and \u03b25, respectively. The third zinc (Zn3) is coordinated by the C-terminal treble-clef zinc finger motif (Fig 3C). A zinc-knuckle on a hairpin loop between \u03b25 and \u03b26 strands provides Cys50 and Cys55 for Zn3 coordination, whereas Cys72 from the C-terminal region of \u03b27 strand and His75 from the loop between \u03b27 and \u03b28 strands provide two more ligands for the zinc. All Cys/His involved in zinc coordination are invariant in CoVs (Fig 4C), indicating the zinc binding is essential for the structure and function of nsp13.",

Superimposition of yeast Upf1 CH (scUpf1 PDB code: 2XZL) and MERS-CoV nsp13 CH aligned 102 C\u03b1 atoms with the Dali Z-score of 10.2 and rmsd of 2.2\u00c5.

Additionally, while the positions of three zincs of MERS-CoV nsp13 CH domain and Upf1 CH domain are nearly identical, Zn3 of EAV nsp10 ZBD is located much closer to Zn1 and Zn2. Particularly, the distance from Zn3 to Zn2 is ~6.4\u00c5 shorter in EAV nsp10 than the corresponding distance in MERS nsp13 (Fig 4B). However, the interaction between the CH domain and the helicase region is significantly different between nidovirus helicases and Upf1, and similar between MERS-CoV nsp13 and EAV nsp10. The MERS-CoV nsp13 CH domain is tightly attached to the Stalk domain (Fig 5A). Helices \u03b12-\u03b14 form a three-helical bundle. The buried area between CH and Stalk is 1670\u00c52. Similarly, the EAV nsp10 ZBD domain is connected to the stalk domain, which is significantly smaller than CH of MERS-CoV nsp13 (Fig 5B). The buried area between ZBD and Stalk is 634.7 \u00c52. By contrast, the CH of Upf1 helicase is linked to the helicase portion through a long and flexible loop (often invisible in the electron density maps), allowing large movement of the CH domain (Fig 5C and 5D)[26].",

To analyze the nucleic acid binding pocket of MERS-CoV nsp13, we generated a model of nsp13-ssRNA based on the superposition of the helicase domain of nsp13 with the helicase domains of hUpf1, scUpf1[26] and EAV nsp10[25]. The model shows that while the 3\u2019 end of single-stranded RNA is located in the channel formed by 1B, Stalk and RecA1 domains; the 5\u2019 end of the RNA lies on top of RecA2 domain (Fig 6A). Although the helical insertion equivalent to the Upf1 1C domain is missing in nsp13, the protein has a topologically equivalent loop between \u03b217 and \u03b218 which fulfills similar function in RNA binding. The \u03b217-\u03b218-loop makes direct contacts with 1B domain, forming the 3\u2019 end outlet of the putative RNA binding channel. The narrowest opening of the putative RNA binding channel has the width and height of 6 and 12\u00c5, which is just enough to accept a single-stranded RNA or DNA (Fig 6B). The dimension of the RNA binding channel of nsp13 is similar to that in EAV nsp10, but smaller than the channel in Upf1. Based on structural comparisons, we predicted the residues of nsp13, which are likely involved in RNA recognition (S2 Fig & S1 Table). Their structural equivalents are mostly conserved in EAV nsp10 and Upf1 helicases, suggesting that CoV nsp13 adopts the similar mechanism for nucleic acids binding.",

In accordance with previously published results, the structure of the helicase cores is well conserved in all three Upf1-like helicases (Table 2). However, some subtle differences could also be identified. Firstly, while the helicase cores of MERS-CoV nsp13 and Upf1 have similar size, the helicase core of EAV nsp10 is more compact. MERS-CoV nsp13 contains seven and five parallel \u03b2-strands in RecA1 and RecA2 domains, respectively, Upf1 has seven and six \u03b2-strands in the RecA1 and RecA2 domain, respectively, whereas EAV nsp10 has only five and four \u03b2-strands in the RecA like domains. Secondly, while three Upf1 like helicases all contain the 1B domain with the \u03b2-barrel fold, only Upf1 has a helical 1C insertion in RecA1 domain. The equivalent 1C insertion is missing in both EAV nsp10[25] and MERS-CoV nsp13 (Fig 4D and 4E). Thirdly, CoVs nsp13 does not contain a C-terminal domain homologous to the C-terminal portion of EAV nsp10 (C-terminal 65 residues), which was shown to regulate ATPase and helicase activities[25]. The sequence conservation analysis showed that the C-terminal domain of arteriviruses and CoVs is indeed poorly conserved[25]. Our crystallographic study provides the complete structure of the extreme C-terminal region of MERS-CoV nsp13, which shows that the C-terminus is an integral part of the RecA2 domain. Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal regulatory domain outside SF1 helicase core is completely missing in MERS-CoV nsp13 and other CoVs helicases.",

Because nsp13 helicase is highly conserved among CoVs, the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 can provide three-dimensional information to understand previous phenotypes of nsp13 mutants. It has been shown that mutations of the conserved Cys/His at ZBD of 229E-CoV nsp13 interfered with its ATPase activity[32]. Ala or Arg replacement of C5003, C5021, C5024 and H5028 abolished or reduced the ATPase activity of 229E-CoV nsp13. Our crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13 confirms that these residues, corresponding to C8, C26, C29 and H33 of MERS-CoV nsp13 (Fig 4C) are coordinating Zn1 and Zn2. The loss of ATPase activity caused by Cys/His substitutes can be attributed to the disruption of zinc-binding and the integrity of the CH domain. Unexpectedly, only C5050A mutant retained significant ATPase activity (~60%). Based on the comparison with corresponding C55 of MERS-CoV nsp13, C5050 of 229E-CoV coordinates Zn3 of the ZBD. Zn3 is the most distantly located zinc from the helicase core (6.4\u00c5 away from Zn2; Fig 1A), and the ZBD/CH is tightly attached to the helicase core in CoV nsp13, it is therefore unsurprising that the impaired binding of Zn3 has the minimal effect on the enzymatic activity of nsp13[32]. This hypothesis is supported by the mutagenesis study of EAV nsp10[25,32], which also showed that while mutant H2414A (ligand for Zn3) retained residual ATPase/ helicase activity and wild-type-level nucleic acid binding activity, the activities of mutants C2395A (ligand for Zn1) and H2399A (ligand for Zn2) was completely abolished.",

Based on the crystal structure of MERS-CoV nsp13, A335 (corresponding to A336 of MERS-CoV nsp13) is located on the \u03b217-\u03b218-loop, a loop interacts with the 1B domain as well as participates in the formation of RNA binding channel. Because A335 is highly exposed to the surface of nsp13, Valine replacement could increase hydrophobicity of this region.

Our analyses demonstrate that while the domain organization of MERS-CoV nsp13 and EAV nsp10 is conserved, the structures of the individual domains of nsp13 are closely related to their eukaryotic equivalents in Upf1 helicase. While the interaction between the CH (or ZBD) domain and the helicase core presents the most distinctive feature differentiating nidovirus helicases from the Upf1 helicases, the high resemblance between the CH domains of MERS-CoV nsp13 and Upf1 helicases is remarkable. This structural similarity not only supports a hypothesis that nidoviruses helicase may have a Upf1-like role in post-transcriptional quality control of viral RNAs synthesis[25], but also implies a possibility that CoV nsp13 might use its Upf1-similar CH domain to interfere with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. It has already been shown that NMD targets viral RNAs for degradation in the early phase of infection of +RNA viruses[37]. Based on the coevolution of virus and host mechanism, the viruses also develop strategies to suppress NMD. Nevertheless, whether CoV nsp13 is involved in NMD suppression requires experimental evidence. To investigate what proteins bind nsp13 through its CH domain and how do they modulate nsp13 function is important to expand our knowledge about the evolution and function of Upf1-like helicases. Finally, our results provide novel structural information essential for structure-based drug design against CoV.",

Nsp13 protein was overexpressed in High-5 insect cells using Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). One liter cell culture (2.0\u00d7106 cells ml-1) was infected with 30 ml baculovirus at 22\u00b0C. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was re-suspended in a lysis buffer containing 25mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 M NaCl and 15mM imidazole and lysed by ultrasonification. High salt concentration in the lysis buffer was necessary to remove nucleic acids bound to nsp13. Protein was purified using Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN). The eluted protein was digested with PreScission protease (GE healthcare) to remove the 6\u00d7His-SUMO tag. Finally, the untagged nsp13 was purified using size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200, GE healthcare). The purified nsp13 was concentrated to ~8 mg/ml in the buffer containing 10mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and 100mM NaCl. Before crystallization trials, nsp13 was mixed with 5\u2019-triphosphate 15 thymine single-stranded DNA (ppp-15T) with 1:1.5 molar ratio and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Crystallization of nsp13 was achieved by mixing equal volume of sample and reservoir buffer (1.0\u03bcl) containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1M (NH4)2SO4 and 15% glycerol. The crystals were grown in a hanging-drop vapor-diffusion system at 18\u00b0C.",

Crystal belonged to the space group P6122, and contained two molecules per ASU. An interpretable electron density map was calculated using SHARP/autoSHARP[41]. An initial model of MERS-CoV nsp13 was manually built using Coot[42]. Finally, a native data with highest resolution (3.0\u00c5) was collected using the X-rays with the wavelength of 0.978\u00c5. Higher resolution structure was solved by molecular replacement using the initial nsp13 structure as the searching model. The 3.0\u00c5 structure was refined using PHENIX[43]. In the final model, 145-230aa (the entire 1B domain) of molecule A are disordered, probably due to mobility of 1B and the lack of crystal contacts, whereas in molecule B, 591 out of 598 amino acids were located in the electron density maps (S4 Fig).",
