In 30 years of pandemic, HIV-1 has infected more than 60 million individuals and killed 25 million. Thirty-three million individuals are currently living with HIV-1 making this disease a major worldwide public health problem (UNAIDS 2010). Natural sterilizing immune response against HIV-1 has never been described and despite decades of intensive research, a vaccine against HIV-1 is still lacking, mainly due to the high ability of the virus to escape from the immune response.",

Coreceptor binding leads to the insertion of the gp41 fusion peptide into the cell membrane, the creation of a hairpin loop intermediate and finally the fusion of both viral and cell membranes. The viral capsid then enters the cell and the genetic material is released in the cytoplasm. Most viral strains use only one coreceptor to enter host cells and are classified accordingly as CCR5- (R5 strains) or CXCR4-tropic (X4 strains), although viruses with broadened coreceptor usage (dual-tropic) have also been described. R5 viruses infect macrophages and CCR5-expressing T lymphocytes, and are mainly associated with transmission. In contrast, X4 viruses infect CXCR4-expressing T-cells and T-cell lines, and often appear at the later stages of infection.",

Moreover, variable immunodominant domains were shown to be recognized by non-neutralizing antibodies. Nonetheless, it is estimated that 10% to 30% of HIV-1-positive subjects develop neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) appearing at least 1 year after infection. Only 1% of infected patients develop a broad neutralizing response against heterologous virus strains [10]. Among HIV-1-infected patients, such antibodies arise only rarely and tardily, thus inefficiently controlling viral replication. However, the recent identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNtAbs) and mapping of their epitopes fueled interest in the humoral immune response against HIV-1 (reviewed by Overbaugh [11]).",

The significance of phage display was first demonstrated for filamentous phages such as M13, fd or related phagemids and later extended to lytic bacteriophages \u03bb, T4 and T7 (reviewed by Beghetto [13]). The phage biopanning process consists of iterative cycles of binding, washing and elution steps leading to the progressive selection of phages displaying peptides/proteins binding to the target of interest [14].

Keller et al. screened a 15-mer Random Peptide Library (RPL) against the BNtAb 447-52D which targets the V3 loop of gp120 (KRKRIHIGPGRAFY) [16] (Figure 3) and identified 70 clones presenting a GPxR consensus sequence [17] (Table 1). These mimotopes were further used in rabbit immunization experiments and elicited neutralizing responses. Boots et al. later investigated the linear epitope recognized by the MAb 447-52D by combining gp120 competition and panning of V3-region biased/constrained libraries. Such a set-up favors the selection of mimotopes in which residues surrounding the GPGR crown motif are similar to those present in the gp120 used for competition, suggesting that the use of strain-specific competitors with a MAb of broad specificity can select for strain-specific mimotopes [18].",

Phages selected with the SA-Bio protocol shared a consensus sequence (Y/L)(V/L/I)GPGRxF homologous to the V3 loop.

Hybridization of MAb 58.2 to 14-mer peptides containing all possible point substitutions within the V3 loop sequence demonstrated that both phage display and peptide array experiments identified the same critical amino acids, thereby confirming the quality of the 20-mer RPL and the validity of the screenings performed.",

The screening of a 6-mer RPL on the MAb 110-A allows the selection of numerous sequences with a consensus motif. Binding assays with synthetic peptides further showed that both MAbs reacted with residues 316\u2013320 of the LAI gp120. In this narrow region, the minimal epitope deduced for the MAb 110-A was HyxRGP, whereas the MAb 19.26.4 recognized the xQ(R/K)GP motif (Hy: non-aromatic AA, underlined: AA tolerating substitutions). Interestingly, the essential QR residues located at positions 317\u2013318 correspond to a QR insertion located upstream of the V3 loop GPGR crown motif that is characteristic of the LAI isolate and may thus explain the restricted specificity of the two MAbs. The same authors screened a 6-mer RPL on the MAb 268, specific to the V3 loop of the MN isolate, and identified two groups of sequences [23]. A representative sequence from the first group (268.1, HLGPGR), corresponded to the crown of the V3 loop, a linear epitope, while two sequences of the second group (268.2, KAIHRI and 268.3, KSLHRH), showed no homology to linear HIV-1 epitopes. Both peptides 268.1 and 268.2 nevertheless inhibited the interaction of MAb 268 with gp120, and were even able to compete with each other for binding to the antibody, indicating that peptide 268.2 was also a mimotope of peptide 268.1. When conjugated to KLH and injected separately into rabbits, both peptides 268-1 and 268-2 were able to elicit gp120-reacting antibodies that partially competed with the homologous peptide, confirming that 268.1 and 268.2 peptides are both antigenic and immunogenic mimics of the gp120 MN V3 loop.",

Ala substitution and deletion studies revealed that each clone bound 2F5 according to a different mechanism.

Biopanning performed on GV1A8 allowed for identification of mimotopes sharing a (L/I)W motif identical to residues 111\u2013112 of the gp120 C1 domain and highlighted a HxxIxxLW motif compatible with two turns of an \u03b1-helix. Computer modeling confirmed that such a structure placed the residues recognized by GV1A8 contiguously on one face of the helix while other secondary structures did not. Similarly, biopanning on MAb GV4D3 yielded sequences with a trend towards an Nx3WxxD motif. The epitope maps to the FNMWKND sequence satisfying the helical motif FxxWxxD.

These mimotopes were immunogenic when injected to mice and elicited an NtAb response against HIV-1. Moreover, the same mimotopes reduced viraemia to undetectable levels in immunized monkeys as shown in a subsequent study [51]. The same year, a similar study conducted on one LTNP with an RPL library of cysteine-constrained 12-mers selected for peptides defining the gp41 ID epitope CSGKLIC.

A consensus motif CxxKxxC was obtained from the 12-mer linear RPL, and the percentage of occurrence of the motif in the selected sequences was proportional to the anti-GKLIC Ab titers of each sample, indicating that these Abs are involved in selection of the consensus motif. Mice immunization experiments with the two mimotopes resembling most to the gp41 ID parental epitope as well as with pools of phages eluted from the panning experiments showed that all phages elicited reactivity, and that immunization with the phage eluates induced the strongest recognition.

Biopanning of a 12-mer RPL against plasma samples from ITM4 resulted in the identification of different peptide sequences. Half of these sequences were homologous to linear epitopes on gp41, i.e., the 4E10 epitope region in the MPER domain (NWFNLTQTLMPR) or the lentivirus lytic peptide 2 (LLP2) (SLxxLRL) while the other peptides shared homologies with the C1 domain (KxWWxA) and the crown of the V3 loop (Kx3IGPHxxY) of gp120. Further analysis of the levels of reactivity of the phage groups against ITM4 six-year follow-up samples revealed different temporal patterns of recognition, confirming the dynamic nature of the immune response.

Six years later, another screening campaign was conducted with a linear 12-mer RPL on 2D7 and the EWQKEGLVTLWL sequence of a high-affinity binding peptide was obtained [65], revealing that this peptide presented homologies to the N-terminal (170-QKEGL-174) and C-terminal (195-TL-196) regions of the CCR5 ECL2.

To expedite the identification of NtAbs directed against weakly immunogenic epitopes, a strategy called epitope-masking was applied in several studies. This biopanning approach is designed to mask a particular epitope with antibodies or ligands directed against the region of interest prior to addition of the phage library. Ditzel et al. panned a Fab library from an asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patient on immobilized recombinant gp120 and identified two dominant clones targeting the CD4-binding site [74]. These two Fabs were then incubated with gp120 to mask their respective epitopes and the panning of the library was repeated, highlighting (based on sequence similarities) four groups of Fabs recognizing gp120 with affinities in the range of 50 to 100 nM. Epitope mapping of one representative Fab for each group showed that gp120 binding of three clones was influenced by the V2 loop and the CD4-binding site and was not affected by the glycosylation status of gp120. Furthermore, one of these Fabs (L78) featured a broad neutralization spectrum against various HIV-1 strains. The authors performed further epitope masking by using different selection strategies with the same Fab phage library [81]. The first strategy involved masking the CD4-binding site (CD4BS) epitopes either with soluble CD4 or with a CD4BS Ab. All Fabs selected on sCD4-bound gp120 recognized the C1 region, while the Fabs isolated from the CD4-BS Ab-captured gp120 were classified in four different groups: (i) Fabs targeting the C1 region, similarly to Fabs isolated on sCD4-bound gp120; (ii) Fabs directed against the C1\u2013C5- region; (iii) Fabs recognizing the V2 loop; and (iv) Fabs directed against a CD4BS/V2 loop region, similar to the neutralizing FAb isolated by Ditzel et al. [74]. Multiple epitope masking was then conducted by masking the CD4BS-MAb-captured gp120 with one of the C1-specific Fabs selected on the sCD4-bound gp120 prior to phage addition, leading to the identification of two C1/C2-dependent Fabs. All isolated Fabs bound their targets with affinities ranging from 4 to 300 nM. However, these FAbs targeting weakly immunogenic regions were not or poorly neutralizing.",

Panning against gp120 selected for a higher number of phagotopes from the preselected library. Clones from the unselected library recognized the V3 loop, while clones from the preselected library targeted the CD4 BS or a CD4-induced epitope encompassing the C1 region. These Fabs displayed no significant differences with respect to epitope specificity, affinity and neutralization ability compared to Fabs obtained from bone marrow libraries, and most of them were unable to neutralize HIV-1. These results were in accordance with previous findings by Parren et al.

In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids also produce antibodies devoid of light chains (Figure 3D). These heavy-chain only antibodies (HcAbs) lack the CH1 domain and their binding specificity is provided by the variable heavy-chain domains of HcAbs (VHH or nanobodies) [136]. The CDR regions of nanobodies are on average longer CDR than those of conventional Abs and display a protruding conformation, thereby more easily binding clefts and active sites. Nanobodies were successfully used for panning against various pathogens (reviewed by Vanlandschoot [137]). Forsman et al. immunized llamas with a recombinant gp120 of subtype B/C (CN54) [78]. Three different panning strategies against various gp120 resulted in the selection of three nanobodies (A12, D7 and C8) with neutralizing activity against a limited panel of clade B and C strains (IC50 values ranging from 0.003 to 38 \u03bcg/mL). These nanobodies bound gp120 with affinities from 0.1 to 1 nM and inhibited its binding to CD4 as well as to MAbs known to recognize the gp120 CD4 binding site and, last but not least, competed with each other for gp120 binding. In a follow-up study, Koh et al. described a family-based approach to produce nanobodies similar to A12 and D7 [77]. They used a degenerated oligonucleotide annealing to the last six codons of CDR3 and framework (FR) 4 and an FR1-specific primer to amplify a sublibrary of related VHH clones with properties similar to the parental A12 or D7 VHH. More than 30 phagotopes were tested for their ability to neutralize 3 clade B and 3 clade C strains. All tested VHH displayed similar neutralizing activity against the clade B viruses. Three different neutralization profiles (Broad A12-like, Intermediate and Narrow D7-like potency) were observed against the clade C type strains and the breadth of neutralization potency appeared to be correlated to the presence of an YYD motif in the C terminus of A12 CDR3. When the CDR3 YDD motif from A12 was introduced within D7, gp120 binding affinity increased by 10-fold and neutralization of clade C strains increased by 5-fold. These studies were the first to demonstrate BNtAbs elicited in immunized animals. As VHH are stable and can be produced at a relatively low cost, they are promising HIV-1 inhibitors.",

Targeting of these epitopes with NtAbs could therefore prevent HIV-1 infection, as has been proven with the clinically approved fusion inhibitor Enfuvirtide. To identify such receptor-induced epitopes, Moulard et al. screened a Fab library constructed from an HIV-1 infected patient (FDA-2) with high NtAb titers against gp120-CD4-CCR5 complexes [83]. One Fab clone, X5, bound gp120 from several strains with a low nanomolar affinity. Furthermore, binding affinity was significantly increased in the presence of CD4 and slightly enhanced by CCR5. Competition assays with a panel of antibodies targeting different HIV-1 epitopes revealed that X5 recognized an epitope located in close vicinity to the CD4 and coreceptor binding sites. Neutralization assays with isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F and G demonstrated that X5 neutralized all isolates with potency comparable to that of b12. X5 is the first BNtAb recognizing a receptor-induced epitope identified to date. To select for ligands for CD4-induced epitopes, murine leukemia virus particles carrying the Env protein of the dual-tropic 89.6 strain pre-incubated with sCD4 were recently used to screen 7-mer, 7-mer-c and 12-mer RPLs [84]. One of the selected phagotopes (XD3: HKQPWYDYWLLR) displaying sequence similarities (in bold) with the N-terminal extracellular part of the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors was identified, suggesting novel potential leads for tyrosine sulfation. Both the XD3 phagotope and XD3 peptides strongly and specifically bound to 89.6 gp120 regardless of CD4 and XD3 competed with MAb 17b for binding to a CD4-induced epitope. The sulfated form of the XD3 peptide recognized X5, R4 and dual-tropic strains and inhibited HIV-1 entry in the high micromolar range.",

This inhibition is mediated by the C-terminal 95\u2013114 GPNGQTCAEKNKCVGHIPGC sequence [139]. Juncadella et al. thus analyzed Salp15 as a potential HIV-1 inhibitor and demonstrated that Salp15 inhibited gp120-CD4 interaction and subsequent cell fusion and that the GPNGQTCAEKNKCVGHIPGC peptide also interacted with gp120 [140]. To identify which gp120 amino acids interacted with peptide 95\u2013114 of Salp15, the authors screened a 7-mer RPL against Salp15 and isolated a HVITPLW sequence homologous to an (I/L)TPL motif of the gp120 C1/V1 domain which is highly conserved across HIV-1 isolates. Finally, they mapped the interaction site of full-length Salp15 protein or of its 95\u2013114 C-terminal domain were able to bind to the PCVKLTPLCVTLNCT peptide within the gp120 C1/V1 region.",

Sequence analysis evidenced that selected gp120-binding Fabs originated from different VH germline genes. Several studies reported that gp120 displays superantigenic properties giving it the ability to bind and stimulate non-immune B cells to secrete VH3 Ig in vitro [142]. Interestingly, the VH3 antibody family is the most represented immunoglobulin gene family in healthy adults (54% of peripheral repertoire) and HIV-1 infection leads to altered VH3 production through selective depletion of the anti-HIV-1 VH3 antibodies [143]. Toran et al. further applied the phage display technology to examine and compare the human VH3 genes involved in IgM and IgG responses to gp120 to identify the correlates of long-term non progression. Two IgM and IgG phage-displayed Fab libraries from an HIV-1-infected LTNP with high gp120-specific IgM and IgG1 titers were constructed and screened [144]. Several clones were selected from the IgM library (M02, M025, 4M26 and 4M40) and three clones from the IgG library (S20, S19 and S8). All IgM Fabs were polyreactive and had a binding affinity for gp120 in the micromolar range while the IgG Fabs were specific and bound gp120 with affinities in the nanomolar range, as expected. Sequence analysis showed that IgG Fabs originated from the same germline Ab. The IgM Fab M025 displayed the same VH region nucleotide substitutions as those of IgG Fab S8 and used similar DH and JH segments, suggesting that S8 arose from M025 by isotype switching. In addition, a four aminoacid difference in the HCDR3 sequence of M025 (TGQWE) and S8 (RGGSI) was proposed to be associated with the 100-fold affinity increase for gp120 and to the higher neutralizing activity of IgG Fab S8 (ID50 = 23 ng/mL) than of IgM M025 (ID50 = 3 \u03bcg/mL). In a follow-up study conducted two years later, the three IgG Fabs were submitted to reverse mutations to reconstitute the germline amino acid residues [145]. The higher affinity and neutralizing ability of S20 were due to the Ala30Arg and Ala31Asp somatic mutations in the HCDR1 region of the germline gene sequence, providing clues for rational modifications of CDR in human antibodies to improve affinity and HIV-1 neutralization capacity.",

To characterize the epitopes recognized by HIV-1-specific IgM and to assess the effects of these Abs on HIV-1 infection, Chen et al. constructed a Fab library from blood, lymph nodes and spleen from 59 healthy donors [146]. The library was panned against gp140 (Env ectodomain containing both gp120 and a truncated gp41 lacking transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail) of a clade B isolate and allowed for the selection of one Fab clone (R3H1m) with a relatively high binding affinity for gp140 from different strains. A sublibrary derived from this clone was panned against gp140 from different isolates, resulting in the selection of clones (m19, m19a, m19b, m19c and m19d) binding with high affinity to clade B and F gp140 (EC50 ranging from 2 nM to 80 nM). While these antibodies had weak neutralizing properties against X4-tropic isolates, they did not inhibit and in some cases even enhanced infection with R5-tropic isolates. The m19 Ab, whose sequence is relatively similar to the germline Ab, targeted highly conserved epitopes located near the CD4 binding site or the coreceptor binding site. The high immunogenic capacity of the conserved non-neutralizing epitopes of such antibodies could divert the immune system from actually neutralizing epitopes. The authors suggested that these newly identified MAbs could be used as probes to further characterize conserved non-neutralizing or enhancing epitopes and to modify or remove them from candidate vaccine immunogens. The epitope masking strategy (section 3.1.1.1.) might be applied to these epitopes to redirect the immune system to elicitation of antibodies targeting neutralizing epitopes.",

In this approach, a phage library of natural l peptides is screened against the mirror image of a target synthesized as d-peptide [150]. By symmetry, the selected d-peptide phagotope sequences will bind the natural l-form of the target. The main advantage of d-peptides over l-peptide inhibitors is their resistance to natural proteases which enhances their oral bioavailability and serum half-life. In a first study, the authors screened a constrained 10-mer RPL against the d-peptide sequence of the gp41 hydrophobic pocket fused to a soluble trimeric coiled-coil (IZN17). Pocket-specific binders with a consensus motif Cx5EWxWLC were identified and inhibited cell fusion or HIV-1 entry into cells with an IC50 in the micromolar range when synthesized using d-amino acids. In a second study, the same authors constructed a sublibrary based on the consensus sequence identified in their first study [89] which allowed the selection of sequences with a fourfold potency increase [87]. Surprisingly, the most potent peptide was a 8-mer with a Cx3EWxWLC motif which was probably selected from the 10-mer sublibrary because its smaller size favored a more compact hydrophobic core upon binding to the gp41 hydrophobic pocket. Screening of second generation d-peptides from a 8-mer CX4WXWLC library led to the selection of pocket-specific inhibitor of entry (PIE) 7 with an IC50 of 620 nM. Dimeric and trimeric forms of PIE7 had respective IC50 values of 1.9 nM and 250 pM. In a third study, the same authors constructed a phage library based on the PIE7 core sequence flanked by two randomized amino acids (xxCDYPEWQWLCxx) and obtained phages with the H(A/P)-[PIE7 core]-(R/K/E)L consensus sequence [88]. A peptide (PIE12, HPCDYPEWQWLCEL) exhibited a broad neutralizing spectrum and was even more efficient than T20, reaching an IC50 of 0.5 nM, when trimerized. Moreover, this third generation PIE12-trimer displays broadened inhibitory potency and resistance to viral variants, as escape mutants required over 65 weeks of selection in vitro to emerge. The PIE12 trimer is thus a promising entry inhibitor and may be used as a topical microbicide in its D conformation.",

            "text": "In 2005, there was no evidence of Abs capable of binding the highly conserved NHR region targeted by the T20 inhibitor. To determine whether antibody fragments could target this determinant on the gp41 protein, Miller et al. constructed a phage-displayed na\u00efve ScFv library and screened it against a synthetic protein mimicking the 6-HB [90]. This construct, named 5-Helix, lacks one of the three CHRs and the NHR trimer is partially exposed, presenting a single binding site for a CHR mimic [151]. The ScFv library was also panned against the IZN36 compound, a homotrimerized form of 36 NHR amino acids fused to a coiled-coil peptide, therefore representing a 6-HB mimic devoid of the CHR trimer [91]. The authors identified a ScFv (D5), which blocks HIV-1 entry and inhibits infection in a single-cycle infectivity assay. This ScFv retained its properties when produced as a whole IgG1. The antibody was found to bind the hydrophobic pocket of the NHR trimer and Ala scan experiments revealed the crucial role of residues L568, W571, and K574 located in the hydrophobic pocket for this interaction. IgG1 D5 was able to neutralize at least five HIV-1 isolates with IC50 ranging from 93 to 1750 nM, thereby demonstrating that the hydrophobic pocket of the NHR trimer is accessible for binding of HIV-1 inhibitors as large as IgGs.",

Screening of this library on the 5-Helix mimic selected for Fabs with affinity and specificity values comparable to those obtained with the ScFv of the previously described D5 Ab [90,153].

Louis et al. screened such a library [155] against antigens comprising the trimeric coiled-coil NHR fused or not to the gp41 six-helix bundle (N35CCG-N13 and NCCG-gp41, respectively) [156,157]. They identified Fabs targeting (i) the 6-HB; (ii) the NHR trimeric coiled-coil or (iii) both 6-HB and trimeric coiled-coil [95]. These antibodies were tested in a cell fusion inhibition assay and the two more potent MAbs, belonging to the third group, featured an IC50 of 6\u20137 \u03bcg/mL. Two years later, the same library was screened against NCCG-gp41 and 6-HB antigens [96]. Two clones, Fabs 3663 and 3670, inhibited cell fusion while one Fab 3674 clone selected against NCCG-gp41 was also effective in infection neutralization assays. Fab 3674 bound the 6-HB as well as stable NHR trimers, and recognized an epitope that partially overlapped the hydrophobic pocket targeted by the D5 Ab. The same authors subsequently demonstrated that the N36Mut(e,g) peptide presenting mutations within the 5th and 7th AA residues of the heptad repeat [158] increased the temporal window of viral sensitivity to Fab 3674 and thereby synergistically enhanced the neutralizing activity of Fab 3674 as well as of the BNtAbs 2F5 and 4E10 [98]. A Fab sublibrary was created by affinity maturation of the Fab 3674 HCDR2 loop and screened against NCCG-gp41, selecting for three Fabs (Fabs 8060, 8066 and 8068) with enhanced potency (average 5-fold decrease in IC50) and neutralization breadth [97].",

Three N35CCGN13 binders were selected, and one of them, 8K8, displayed neutralizing activity against HXB2. In parallel a more complex Fab library was constructed from the FDA-2 HIV-1- positive patient from whom Z13 Ab had previously been isolated [85]. Screening this library against N35CCGN13 allowed for the isolation of Fab DN9 [99]. Both ScFv 8K8 and Fab DN9 neutralized HIV-1 infection with a panel of viral strains with IC50 ranging from 50 to 500 nM and targeted the NHR trimeric coiled-coil, presumably close to the hydrophobic pocket. Three additional gp41-specific Abs (M44, M46 and M48) were obtained by screening antibody phage libraries from asymptomatic seropositive patients [159] against gp140 [100\u2013102]. A recombinant gp140 (gp140 R2) isolated from an asymptomatic seropositive patient with BNtAbs was reported to elicit BNtAbs in monkeys, further demonstrating that immunogenic epitopes were exposed on this recombinant antigen [101]. Competitive antigen panning (CAP) (biopanning approach designed to outcompete phagotopes binding to an immunodominant region of a multi-domain target through concomitant addition of an excess of soluble forms of this immunodominant domain) using a mixture of gp140R2 as antigen and gp120R2 as competitor resulted in the selection of a gp41-specific M46 Ab [101]. M46 displayed broad neutralization properties and recognized a conformational epitope and bound weakly to 5-Helix antigen but not to the trimeric NHR nor to 6-HB. In two other studies, the same libraries were panned against gp140/120 from three different isolates (89.6, cm243 and R2), which led to the identification of the M48 Ab recognizing a conformational epitope of gp140 [102] and the M44 Ab, which binds gp140, 5-Helix and 6-HB but not to the NHR trimeric coiled-coil. M44 recognized a conserved conformational epitope and neutralized isolates from different clades with a significantly higher potency than 4E10 or Z13 [100]. The competitive antigen panning approach against gp140/120 thus allows the selection of Abs recognizing conformational epitopes on gp41, which are not properly folded when gp41 is used as a target.",

Cotransfection experiments indicated that the WxxF motif might be used to deliver a fusion protein into the HIV-1 virion through a new docking strategy.",

Synthesis of the peptides corresponding to the CDR3 regions of the heavy and light chains showed that the heavy chain CDR3 inhibited RDDP activity while the light chain peptide had no effect. These HCDR3 peptides represent the smallest antibody fragments inhibiting the RT identified to date and demonstrated that HCDR3 repertoire is a potential source of bioactive molecules (see Section 3.2.1.2.).",

            "text": "Rev is a key regulatory protein. Oligomerized Rev binds to unspliced or singly spliced viral mRNA and ensures its transport to the cytoplasm, thereby allowing the translation of viral gene products. Despite considerable efforts, the structure of Rev is poorly characterized since Rev is refractory to crystallization, mainly because of its tendency to form insoluble aggregates [175]. In the absence of structural information, the phage display technology was used by different authors to map the domains involved in the interaction of Rev with its network of partners. Pilkington et al. identified two Rev-specific Fabs from a Fab library derived from the Ab repertoire of an HIV-1-infected asymptomatic patient [106]. These Fabs were directed against sites adjacent to the Rev basic nuclear localization signal (NLS) (residues 52\u201364) and to the activation domain (residues 75\u201388). Two years later, Jensen et al. screened a 15-mer RPL to identify potential Rev peptidic antagonists [121]. Three groups of sequences sharing a SRLxG(x)2\u20133R motif (group I), sharing a RVV(x)2\u20134RG/A motif (group II) or featuring no sequence similarity (group III), were obtained. Three clones were selected based on their high frequency of occurrence (p1 and p3, group I) or on their strong binding affinity for Rev (p19, group III). They were synthesized as peptides and were shown to retain Rev binding specificity. More recently, llama nanobody libraries from animals immunized with recombinant Rev allowed the identification of 12 Rev-binding nanobodies [123]. One of them (Nb190) prevented or disrupted Rev multimerization by interacting with Lys20 and Tyr23 of the Rev N-terminal \u03b1-helix [122]. Besides inhibitor discovery, Fabs were recently proposed as \u201ccrystal chaperones\u201d to support crystallization of their partners by locking them in specific conformations and blocking aggregation [124]. Stahl et al. described the preparation, characterization, and crystallization of an equimolar complex formed between Rev and a chimeric rabbit/human Fab (SJS-R1) selected through phage display [124]. The Rev/SJS-R1 Fab complex was successfully crystallized and the Fab SJS-R1 was shown to recognize a conformational epitope in the N-terminal half of Rev. Structural characterization of the crystallized Fab/Rev complex is ongoing and a corresponding ScFv has been engineered and may have anti-HIV-1 properties.",

These proteoliposomes were used in biopanning experiments with a human ScFv antibody library and several antibody fragments specifically binding to CCR5-expressing cells were identified. The same year, Steinberger et al. used the phage display technology to select and to humanize rabbit anti-CCR5 antibodies preventing the export of CCR5 to the cell surface [184]. Following rabbit immunization with a GST-Nterm CCR5 fusion protein, the authors constructed a phage displayed Fab library that was screened against the antigen initially used for the immunization. A phagotope (ST6) binding strongly and specifically to the immobilized antigen as well as to CCR5-positive cells was identified, expressed as a ScFv and humanized by successive replacements of the rabbit light and heavy chains by their human counterparts. One humanized antibody fragment, ST6/34, that retained the strong CCR5-binding capacity of the parental ST6 antibody was isolated from the screening of the intermediate libraries. When expressed as intrabody the ST6/34 scFV efficiently blocked the CCR5 expression at the cell surface.",

[191]. In this strategy, a phage library displaying randomly mutated and N-terminally extended CCL5 chemokine variants (xS#xSSx###-CCL5, where # represents either A, P, S or T) was constructed and screened on CCR5-expressing cells. Only intracellular phagotopes that had induced CCR5 receptor internalization were recovered. Two CCL5 variants (P1 = LSPVSSQSSA-CCL5 and P2 = FSPLSSQSSA-CCL5) were identified. These variants displayed a higher selectivity for CCR5 and had more potent HIV-1 inhibitory abilities than the wild-type CCL5 chemokine. Further characterization demonstrated that P2 acted as a CCR5 superagonist and potently induced intracellular CCR5 sequestration. P1 was less potent but significantly reduced CCR5-dependent intracellular calcium signaling. In a subsequent study, P1 and P2 variants were optimized by phage display biopanning to select for variants that retained the high anti HIV-1 potency of P1 and P2 but reduced CCR5-agonist activity [186]. Three successive generations of libraries (xxPx3Q#TP-CCL5, QGPPLMx4-CCL5 and QGP\u03a8$x5-CCL5 where \u03a8 represents G, L or P and $ represents G, L or M) were constructed and screened as previously described [185]. The three most interesting candidates (5P12-CCL5, 5P14-CCL5 and 6P4-CCL5) produced as soluble proteins displayed highly potent antiviral activities. Analogue 6P4-CCL5 acted as an agonist and sequestered CCR5, 5P12-CCL5 induced no signaling or receptor sequestration while 5P14-CCL5 induced CCR5 internalization without triggering G-protein signaling. Altogether these data demonstrated that antiviral activities of similar molecules identified through phage display screening can rely on various mechanisms of action.",

A phage library was subsequently constructed from the PBMCs of immunized camelids and several phage clones inhibiting the binding of labeled CXCL12 chemokine to the receptor were identified. In particular, two VHHS (238D2 and 238D4) showed low nanomolar affinity for the receptor and inhibited entry of X4 and X4/R5-viruses into different CXCR4+ cell types with IC50 values ranging from 10 to 100 nM. Dimerization of 238D2 and 238D4 to form biparatopic proteins increased their antiviral properties to IC50 values in the picomolar range.

The CD40 receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, and its CD40L ligand are involved in several biological processes including cell proliferation, activation and production of cytokines and chemokines. During HIV-1 infection, viruses were proposed to selectively downregulate or even deplete the pool of CD40L-expressing CD4+ T cells. In this context, antibodies binding to CD40 and restoring the HIV-1-induced CD40L downregulation might be of interest. In 2002, Ellmark et al. identified a set of anti-CD40 antibody fragments through biopanning of a human ScFv phage library against a biotinylated CD40 antigen [189]. When expressed as full-length IgG1 one antibody (clone B44) suppressed HIV-1 infection by a R5-tropic virus, most probably through induction of CC chemokine production [188]. More recently, the DDX3 protein, a cellular RNA helicase involved in RNA unwinding was shown to play important roles in HIV-1 replication. This protein presents a unique region (ALRAMKENG) responsible for high affinity binding to the HIV-1 RNA. Garbelli et al. carried out a biopanning experiment with a mix of linear 12-mer and linear and constrained 7-mer RPL against a peptide mimicking the DDX3 region interacting with HIV-1. They identified a 7-mer peptide (SDVPTQV) blocking the replication of an X4-tropic virus with an IC50 of 20 \u03bcM [190].",

This \u201cphage substrate\u201d approach relies on the use of phage particles to screen for enzyme substrates instead of classical binder selection. Protease cleavage profiling using phage takes advantage of the natural resistance of phage particles to proteolysis. Phage particles displaying random peptides are immobilized on a solid support and submitted to proteolytic elution to specifically liberate phages presenting peptides corresponding to the protease cleavage site. The phage substrate approach allows thus to rapidly determine the cleavage profile of a given protease and provides optimized substrate candidates which can be further used as leads for the development of specific inhibitors. Over the last two decades, phage substrate has been applied to a large variety of proteases including the HIV-1 protease (PR) [198,199]. The HIV-1 PR is a homodimeric aspartic protease responsible for nine critical cleavage steps within both the structural (Gag) and the non-structural (Gag/pol) polyproteins. The HIV-1 protease recognizes substrate residues encompassing P4 to P3\u2032 positions (Schechter and Berger\u2019s nomenclature), with the primary determinants from positions P2 to P2\u2032 positions [200,201]. Interestingly, alignment of the nine natural substrate cleavage sites of the HIV-1 PR shows a high sequence diversity suggesting a broad proteolytic specificity. In 2000, Beck et al. reported the use of hexapeptide phage library to unravel the HIV-1 PR specificity and develop new protease inhibitors (Table 6) [199]. This library was constructed by fusing the Mab 3-E7 epitope upstream of the randomized sequences. Phages were first incubated with the HIV-1 PR and uncleaved phages were removed by addition of pansorbin cells. Biopanning selected for highly diverse sequences consistent with the suggested broad substrate specificity of the HIV-1 protease. However, none of the selected peptides corresponded to the HIV-1 polyproteins cleavage sites.",

Further mutational analysis of synthetic peptides derived from a sequence processed with the same efficiency by the two proteases (KSGVF\u2193VVNG) was performed to assess the influence of amino acid substitutions on the catalytic process of each PR (Table 6, underlined sequence). They showed that substitutions for a Val at position P2 or P2\u2032 increased the cleavage by the HIV-1 protease whereas the introduction of a Val at position P1 was more favorable to FIV protease activity. In particular, the GSGVF\u03a8(CH2NH)VVNGL inhibitor identified in the first study was active against both PRs with different potencies and replacement of its amide group by a hydroxyethylene group resulted in a peptide with equivalent inhibitory activity towards both the HIV-1 and the FIV proteases.",

Immunization of rabbits with filamentous M13 phage particles displaying a small peptide (GEDRW) derived from the p17 Gag protein in fusion with pIII minor coat protein elicited the production of specific IgGs reacting with the natural p17 antigen as well as with the Gag precursor protein. Shortly afterwards, two studies reported that mice immunization with fd phages displaying the gp120 V3 loop fused to the pIII protein induced high titers of antibodies cross-reacting with V3 loops of different strains and featuring neutralizing activity [207,210]. The major coat protein pVIII of the fd phage (2700 copies per particles) was also investigated as scaffold protein for vaccination. Immunization with phages displaying a pVIII-fused peptide corresponding to residues 309\u2013317 of the HIV-1 RT resulted in the induction of a specific cytotoxic T- cell response (CTL) against the displayed peptide. Priming nevertheless required a co-immunization with a T-helper epitope from the same protein (KDSWTVNDIQKLVGK) provided by either the same or a separate phage particle [206]. More recently attempts to prime CTL response were conducted with M13 phages displaying a mixture of thousands of variants of CTL epitopes (RGPGxAx4 or xGxGxAxVxI) derived from the gp120 V3 loop (residues 311\u2013320; RGPGRAFVTI) presented in an immunoglobulin VH domain scaffold [215]. Mice immunization provided potent and broad epitope-specific long lasting response (12 months) and effector memory T cells were induced. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that mice immunized with these variable epitope libraries are capable of neutralizing half of the subtype B viral isolates used for challenge, including HIV-1 isolates which are known to be resistant to neutralization by several potent monoclonal antibodies [218].",

In contrast to pIII and pVIII proteins, SOC and HOC present the major advantage of being dispensable for phage assembly yet of being able to strongly bind to the outer surface of the capsid, if added subsequently [219]. SOC and HOC self-associate to the capsid at a display level of 960 and 150 copies per capsid, a far higher density than that of filamentous minor coat protein (3 to 5 copies). HOC protein provides high-density display of single as well as multiple antigens and immunization of mice with the p24-HOC-T4 elicits strong humoral and cellular responses.",

Further study demonstrated that HOC protein can also be used to display various HIV-1 antigens including the p24, Nef or a trimeric peptide derived from the C-terminus of gp41 [216]. More recently, lambda phage and its decorating capsid protein were used for dense display of glycosylated mammalian cell-derived trimers of gp140 protein [213]. Lambda phage provided a display level of 30 copies of gp140 trimer per particle, a 20-fold higher display than observed on native HIV-1 virions (14 \u00b1 7 spikes per virion) [220]. Rabbit immunization trials were rather disappointing and higher antibody titers were elicited in animals receiving soluble oligomeric gp140. These results were proposed to be due to the sequential immunization process and to the strong and immunodominant response against phage capsid proteins, which is most probably boosted upon sequential immunization, and could lead to a decrease of the humoral immune response to the displayed antigen.",

HIV-1 is to the best of our knowledge the only pathogen to which all four applications of the phage display technology described in this review\u2014i.e., epitope mapping, inhibitor discovery, substrate presentation and carrier phage- have been applied. Parallel improvements in the technology on one hand, and crucial discoveries in the HIV-1 field on the other hand, most likely account for such a tight interplay. The phage display technology applied to HIV-1 has provided precious knowledge concerning the regions recognized by the Ab repertoire of immune patients, and allowed to identify immunodominant regions. It has also allowed to map the epitopes of numerous monoclonal antibodies directed against viral and host proteins, and, most importantly, discontinuous epitopes. Alternative phage display biopanning substractive procedures such as epitope masking or competitive antigen panning also precisely highlighted non-immunodominant regions of the HIV-1 antigen, which had remained occult using classical biopanning approaches. Although the antibodies identified through epitope-masking are mostly devoid of neutralizing activity, this strategy led to the identification of Fabs binding with high affinity to specific targets. Taking advantage of this affinity, approaches aiming at engineering bispecific antibodies, coupling these inhibitors to toxins, or multimerizing them to increase their binding avidity could lead to the development of antiviral compounds or more efficient vaccine candidates.",

Other inhibitors were identified from semi-synthetic (ligand analogues of CCL5) or randomized peptide libraries (d-peptides: PIE123) and their affinity was improved through secondary libraries. These inhibitors were selected against different targets (Env proteins, coreceptors) by biopanning carried out using different types of support (immobilized proteins, cells, peptides), illustrating the power and versatility of the phage display technology [41,83,85] (Figure 5).",

To this regard, phages are being extensively explored to increase immune responsiveness. The latest developments include exploiting the phage as DNA vaccine carrier or hybrid phage and pursuing the symbiotic interplay between phage display and HIV-1.",
