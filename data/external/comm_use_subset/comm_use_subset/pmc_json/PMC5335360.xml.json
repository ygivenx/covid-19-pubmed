Within the center of the Teflon film, an aperture of approximately 100 \u03bcm in diameter was created utilizing a High-Frequency Spark Tester PPM MK3 (Buckleys Ltd.) adjusted to 45 kV. In order to create a hydrophobic interface to attract lipids, the aperture was treated with a 1% hexadecane in pentane solution. One and a half mL of buffer T (1 M KCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) or PA (150 mM KCl, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.2) was added to each half of the chamber. Five microliters of asolectin dissolved in pentane at a concentration of 5 mg/mL was added to the surface of the buffer on both sides. Ag/AgCl electrodes were then inserted into the buffer solutions. The chamber-electrode configuration was then allowed to equilibrate before formation of a lipid bilayer over the aperture. A membrane bilayer was formed over the aperture by lowering and raising the buffer level in one of the half-chambers and monitoring the resistance on the oscilloscope. A high resistance indicated that a bilayer had formed. A transmembrane voltage of + or \u221290 mV was then applied to check membrane stability for 10 minutes. This was also performed to ensure that there was no contaminating channel-like activity prior to the addition of channel-forming protein. If the stability test showed no contaminants and a stable baseline, then NSP4 peptide dissolved in DMSO or water (4.0\u20138.0 \u03bcg) was added to one half-chamber, defined as the cis side. A membrane potential of + or \u221290 mV and stirring of the cis side were typically used to promote insertion. Channel insertion was detected by the appearance of channel activity. Once channel activity was detected, stirring was stopped to limit further insertions.",

GUVs were generated by applying 20 \u03bcL of 10 mM DPhPC + 10% cholesterol dissolved in chloroform onto the slide, allowed to air dry, and 1 M sorbitol was used for the external solution for GUV swelling. GUVs were collected and either left as protein-free GUVs (negative control) or reconstituted with 10 ng/mL of the NSP4-VPD peptide dissolved in water for 1 hr at room temperature. After reconstitution the GUVs were kept at 4 \u00b0C until use. For patch clamp of GUVs we used the Port-a-Patch system (Nanion) with 8\u201312 megaohm patching chips (~1 \u03bcm aperture). Briefly, patches were established in symmetric 650 mM KCl buffer by adding 5 \u03bcL of protein-free or NSP4-reconstituted GUVs to the chips under slight negative pressure (\u221210 to \u221240 mbar). Upon contact with the aperture, the GUV ruptures to form a bilayer with high seal resistance (>10 Gigaohm) that was very reproducible. Once seals were established, residual sorbitol was removed by exchanging the bath buffer 3 times with 20 \u03bcL of 650 mM KCl and potential offsets were canceled electronically before data acquisition. Relative selectivity between cations and anions was performed by running voltage steps from \u2212100 mV to +100 mV initially in symmetric 650 mM KCl and then after bath buffer exchange with 65 mM KCl to generate a 1:10 asymmetric 650 mM KCl/65 mM KCl gradient across the bilayer. Patch clamp data were acquired using an EPC10 amplifier and PatchMaster software (HEKA, Germany). The measured open channel current for each voltage was plotted and a linear regression line fitted to determine the reversal potential. The expected K+and Cl\u2212 reversal potentials were calculated using the Nernst equation and the relative permeability of K+to Cl\u2212 was determined using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation12.",

OD630 measurements of each culture were taken before IPTG induction and at 10 min intervals after induction for 90 min. Additional samples were taken at 0, 10, 30, 60 and 90 min post-induction for immunoblot analysis as previously described14. Gel loading was normalized to the OD630, and for samples of cells that had lysed, the OD630 just prior to lysis was used for normalization.

            "text": "We tested the wild-type NSP4 VPD (VPD-WT) for ion channel activity using two well-established electrophysiology techniques, planar lipid bilayer and patch-clamp. In both techniques, we captured two unique electrophysiological signatures that characterize VPD-WT (Fig. 2). Figure 2A and B show that VPD-WT could display canonical well-defined opening events that measured ~65 pS in symmetric buffer conditions of 150 mM KCl when using either technique. These canonical \u201csquare-top\u201d events are similar to those displayed by classical voltage or ligand-gated ion channels, with stochastic transitions between open and closed states of varying durations that averaged 10 and 25 ms, respectively. In addition, a second electrophysiological signature was observed for VPD-WT in a large majority of the experiments, and characterized by fast kinetics, as illustrated in Fig. 2C and D. Here, very transient and frequent fluctuations (open time <1 ms) to various open states give rise to a particularly \u201cspiky\u201d recording. Although this type of \u201cspiky\u201d ion channel activity is commonly observed among many viroporins4, conductance measurements require that the channel remain in the open state for a duration long enough to determine the current plateau with minimal error due to noise. When the opening transitions last for just a few sample points, it is challenging to make a reliable measurement of the open channel current. While it does provide evidence of ion channel activity, when the channel is in the fast kinetic state it is not possible to accurately determine the number of channels in the bilayer or patch or measure the single-channel conductance due to the transient nature of the openings. In addition, the high frequency of openings may be due to the concerted kinetics of multiple inserted VPD-WT oligomers in the lipid bilayer resulting in bursts of channel openings with very fast kinetics.",

A patch-clamp recording of VPD-WT dissolved in DMSO and reconstituted into liposomes utilizing the cloud method (see Materials and Methods) illustrates the ability of VPD-WT to shift kinetic states within the same experiment. As seen in the expanded segment (Fig. 3, red box), the reconstituted channel first displayed openings with a well-defined level of conductance measuring approximately 50 pS. However, within 500 milliseconds, the channel transitioned to a \u201cspiky\u201d behavior observed in a majority of the experiments (Fig. 3, blue box). While other viroporins have been characterized as having both fast current fluctuations (\u2018spiky\u2019 activity) and well-defined openings, these two kinetic signatures have rarely (if ever) been demonstrated to occur during the same recording4. Further, recordings, such as in Fig. 3, show a clear transition between the kinetic state characterized by well-defined openings and that by fast kinetics. Since fast current fluctuations did not occur while the channel was already open to a well-defined conductance level, but rather stretches with fast and prolonged current transitions were consecutive, this recording originates from a single channel which oscillates between the two kinetics states, and not from multiple channels with different kinetic properties.",

To determine the relative permeability of NSP4-VPD to cations and anions, we determined the current-voltage relationship in both symmetric and a 1:10 asymmetric KCl solutions. In symmetric 650 mM KCl, NSP4-VPD displayed a linear current-voltage relationship with a reversal potential of ~7 mV, representing a slight offset from the 0 mV value expected for symmetric buffers (Fig. 4). The bath buffer was then exchanged to 65 mM KCl to generate a 1:10 gradient across the patch. In this condition, the equilibrium potentials calculated with the Nernst equation are \u221258 mV for K+ (EK) and +58 mV for Cl\u2212 (ECl). Thus, the I/V plot of an ideal K+-selective channel would intersect the abscissa (0 pA) at \u221258 mV, while that of an ideal Cl\u2212-selective channel would intersect the abscissa at + 58 mV. The intersect of the I/V plot with the abscissa is called the \u201creversal potential\u201d. For NSP4 VPD, the 1:10 KCl gradient shifted the reversal potential to \u221239 mV, closer to EK and away from ECl. This demonstrated that NSP4-VPD selectively conducted cations (K+) over anions (Cl\u2212). With this data, we used the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation12 to determine that NSP4-VPD has a ~16-fold greater selectivity for cations over anions, making it a strongly cation selective viroporin.",

To test this, we recorded the activity of VPD-WT in patch-clamp in symmetric buffer A conditions [buffer A (containing 150 mM KCl, and 10 \u03bcM CaCl2) in both the bath and the pipette], and then perfused buffer CA (containing 75 mM CaCl2) into the bath. If the channel is able to conduct Ca2+, in these asymmetric buffer conditions opening transitions should be observed when a negative pipette voltage is applied to draw Ca2+ into the pipette. Figure 5 illustrates that this is indeed the case. At a pipette voltage of +70 mV or \u221270 mV, we observed well-defined levels of conductance measuring 42 pS in symmetric buffer A conditions (Fig. 5A,B). Occasionally a smaller 13 pS open state could also be observed (marked by the arrow in Fig. 5). When buffer CA was perfused into the bath, we continued to observe well-defined channel openings at both positive and negative voltages, indicating that the channel is indeed permeable to Ca2+, the sole cation able to sustain a current at negative pipette potentials (Fig. 5C,D). The conductance, however, was slightly reduced (29 pS vs 42 pS, Supp. Fig. 1), and the kinetics appear faster, but given the variability we observed in kinetic signatures, it is hard to ascertain whether this is due to the presence of Ca2+ or not. Current-voltage relationships obtained from these recordings (Supp. Fig. 1) showed that the reversal potential shifted only slightly (~7 mV) in asymmetric conditions. Therefore, the channel does not appear to be more selective for K+ than Ca2+.",

First, we used an E. coli lysis assay to confirm that the VPD-Mut lacks viroporin activity (Fig. 7A). The E. coli lysis assay is a common method for rapidly assessing viroporin activity and was used previously to identify NSP4 mutations that disrupt viroporin function1. Expression of the VPD-WT protein caused E. coli lysis but cells expressing VPD-Mut did not lyse despite substantial protein expression (Fig. 7A,B). Western blot analysis confirmed that both VPD-WT and VPD-Mut expressed at similar rates, but the VPD-Mut construct expressed at a much higher level due to the lower cytotoxicity. These data confirm our initial findings that this mutation disrupts NSP4 viroporin activity. We previously showed that both the WT and viroporin-deficient NSP4 mutant were integral membrane proteins using a NSP4 construct consisting of both the viroporin domain and coiled-coil domain [e.g., NSP4 (47\u2013146)]; however, since the studies presented here use the VPD alone, we sought to determine whether the mutation disrupts membrane localization of this short peptide. We expressed the VPD-WT and VPD-Mut in E. coli, as above, along with control NSP4 constructs known to be membrane localized [NSP4 (47\u2013146)] or soluble [NSP4 (95\u2013146)]. The cells were separated into soluble, peripheral, and integral membrane fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 7C). Similar to our previous results13, NSP4 (47\u2013146) was found both in peripheral and integral membrane fractions but NSP4 (95\u2013146) was primarily in the soluble fraction (Fig. 7C, upper panel). Both the VPD-WT and VPD-Mut peptides localized to the membrane fractions similarly to the larger NSP4 (47\u2013146) control, confirming that the VPD is sufficient to drive membrane localization and insertion and that the mutation to disrupt viroporin activity does not alter either membrane localization or the ability to insert into the membrane.",

Therefore, to confirm that NSP4 VPD-WT can conduct Ca2+ and test whether the VPD-Mut was deficient in Ca2+ conduction, we used a liposome-based assay that measures the fluorescence of a Ca2+ indicator within liposomes to determine Ca2+ conductivity of an ion channel17. Briefly, liposomes are formed in a Ca2+-free buffer containing Fluo-5N, a green fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, which is encapsulated into the liposomes. After removing the non-encapsulated dye, the liposomes were resuspended in buffer containing 2 mM CaCl2, baseline fluorescence measured, and 15 \u03bcM of either the VPD-WT or VPD-Mut NSP4 peptide. Ca2+ conducted into the liposomes by NSP4 is measured as an increase in Fluo-5N fluorescence. Addition of the vehicle alone (water) did not cause an increase in fluorescence over time (Fig. 7C, black line). Both NSP4 peptides caused an immediate increase in fluorescence due to some liposome lysis due to the localized high peptide concentration immediately after addition of the peptide. However, only VPD-WT caused a subsequent steady increase in Fluo-5N fluorescence over time (Fig. 7C, red line), while addition of the VPD-Mut peptide did not lead to increased fluorescence (Fig. 7C, blue line). This data confirmed that VPD-WT can conduct Ca2+ but that the VPD-Mut peptide is deficient in Ca2+ conductivity. Further, this assay demonstrates that NSP4 VPD-WT can conduct Ca2+ down a strong gradient (2 mM Ca2+ outside/0 mM Ca2+ inside) in the presence of symmetric 150 mM Na+, suggesting that NSP4 VPD-WT peptide can sustain a significant Ca2+ flux even in the presence of high monovalent cation levels, as would occur between the ER lumen and cytoplasm of RV-infected cells.",

Extracellular NSP4 (eNSP4) is a secreted enterotoxin that consists of a proteolytic cleavage product of the NSP4 cytoplasmic tail and elicits a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent Ca2+ flux through interaction with cell surface receptors8. In contrast, intracellular NSP4 (iNSP4) localizes to the ER membrane and elevates cytosolic Ca2+ through its viroporin activity1. Previous data showed that recombinant expression of iNSP4 reduced the amount of ER Ca2+ released upon stimulation of cells with known Ca2+ agonists (e.g., ATP), indicating that NSP4 increases the basal leakiness of the ER, possibly by ion channel activity18. These early studies were supported by the identification of the NSP4 VPD1319 and now confirmed here by demonstrating that VPD forms a Ca2+-conducting ion channel.",

            "text": "The electrophysiology studies reported here show that the NSP4 VPD is indeed a bona fide ion channel, since it displays discrete levels of conductance. Interestingly, the NSP4 VPD peptide was soluble in water, which is distinct for other reported viroporins (although this may not have been tested), and we speculate that the aqueous solubility of this peptide may have contributed to the relatively low reconstitution efficiency observed. The NSP4 VPD channel was capable of conducting K+, Ca2+, and Ba2+ ions and shows a strong selectivity for cations over anions, but interestingly, it was not selective for Ca2+ over K+ ions. Thus, like most viroporins, NSP4 is a non-selective cation channel with stochastic gating events; however, the permeability of VPD-WT for divalent ions sets it apart from many other viroporins, which are generally monovalent cation selective with low divalent cation permeability3420. The lack of Ca2+ selectivity is likely not an impediment to the release of ER Ca2+ in RV-infected cells because the 1000\u20135000 fold Ca2+ gradient across the ER membrane enables a sustained Ca2+ current even through a non-selective channel. The ability of NSP4 VPD-WT to conduct Ca2+ into dye-loaded liposomes in the presence of 150 mM Na+ supports this conclusion. These data fit with our previous observation that the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) pathway are activated in RV-infected and NSP4-WT expressing cells, but not in cells expressing the viroporin-defective NSP4 mutant9, which did not conduct Ca2+ in the liposome assay. Thus, our data indicates that the ion channel activity of the NSP4 VPD is mechanistically responsible for the PLC-independent elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ by both releasing ER Ca2+ and through this depletion of ER Ca2+, inducing the activation of SOCE through the plasma membrane.",

However, our previous study identified the NSP4 pentalysine domain, not the amphipathic domain, as the critical motif for transmembrane insertion of NSP413 and the importance of basic residues for viroporin membrane insertion was also demonstrated for the poliovirus 2B viroporin21.

This kinetic behavior is similar to that reported for other viroporins such as HCV p722 and Influenza A\u2019s PB1-F217. However, it is possible that NSP4\u2019s ion channel characteristics may be altered or regulated by domains outside of the core viroporin domain, particularly NSP4\u2019s cytoplasmic tail. Unlike most other viroporins, NSP4 has a long cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain (CCD) immediately downstream of the VPD that is not necessary for viroporin or ion channel activity but nevertheless may contain motifs that serve to regulate NSP4 channel activity. Recent studies have shown that the NSP4 CCD binds Ca2+ ions, takes on multiple oligomeric forms, and associates with several cellular and viral proteins2324. Each of these properties offer possible mechanisms by which NSP4 channel activity could be regulated in the course of a RV infection. Of particular interest is the conserved Ca2+ binding site (aa120/123), which was recently shown to depend on the oligomerization state of the CCD and is regulated by changes in pH2324. Interestingly, cellular ER-localized Ca2+ release channels are regulated by cytosolic Ca2+, but thus far, no Ca2+-dependent regulatory domain has been identified in a viroporin. In contrast, there is precedent for pH-mediated regulation of viroporins, since gating of the M2 viroporin from influenza A virus and the p7 viroporin from some hepatitis C virus strains are regulated by the pH of the endocytic compartment2526. Thus, this study establishes the basis for future investigations on how NSP4 ion channel activity might be regulated through the CCD by changes in cytosolic pH or Ca2+ levels during the course of a RV infection.",

The well-defined opening events of NSP4 display a conductance in the range of ~40\u201360 pS similar to the conductance of L-type calcium channels, and it is possible that NSP4 could be blocked by L-type calcium channel blockers such as the benzothiazepine, dihydropyridine, or phenylalkylamine classes of blockers, which are widely used clinically, even in children27. Some of these drugs inhibit Ca2+ influx into RV-infected cells, which was predicted to be through blocking plasma membrane-localized host Ca2+ channels; however, it is possible these drugs may also inhibit NSP4 functions28. Further, blockers of NSP4 ion channel activity may also potently block RV-induced secretory diarrhea, because the NSP4-mediated elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+ is critical for Cl\u2212 secretion both from RV-infected enterocytes and through activation of the enteric nervous system via increased serotonin secretion2930.",
