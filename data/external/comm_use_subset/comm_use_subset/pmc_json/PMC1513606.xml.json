The T cell surface is enriched in a particular receptor protein: the T cell receptor or TCR, which binds to major histocompatibility complex proteins (MHCs) expressed on the surfaces of other cells. MHCs bind small peptide fragments derived from both host and pathogen proteins. It is the recognition of such complexes that lies at the heart of the cellular immune response. These short peptides are known as epitopes. Although the significance of non-peptide epitopes, such as lipids and carbohydrates, is now understood increasingly well, peptidic B cell and T cell epitopes (as mediated by the humoral and cellular immune systems respectively) remain the primary tools by which the intricate complexity of the immune response might be examined. While the prediction of B-cell epitopes remains primitive [1], a multiplicity of sophisticated methods for the prediction of T-cell epitopes has developed [2].",

            "text": "The earliest efforts in predicting the binding of short peptides to MHC molecules focused on identifying peptide sequence motifs that were characteristic of binding to MHC [3]. This motif approach assumed that the presence of certain residues at specific positions (which are referred to as \"anchor\" positions) critically defined the binding ability of the peptide to the MHC. This somewhat simplistic assumption rendered the motif approach prone to false predictions. Later methods adopted more informative representations of peptide binding and more sophisticated modeling strategies such as position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) [4-7], artificial neural networks (ANN) [8-10], hidden Markov model (HMM) [11] and support vector machine (SVM) classification [12,13]. With increasing amounts of MHC-peptide binding data available to facilitate their optimization, these methods have become increasingly effective in making predictions about whether a given peptide binds to a particular MHC molecule, and \u2013 when it does bind \u2013 whether the binding is strong or weak.",

The additive method developed by Doytchinova et al. is a representative example of this trend. In this method, the binding affinity of the MHC-peptide interaction is modeled as the sum of peptide background contribution (a constant term), the amino acid contributions at each position, and (optionally) the adjacent peptide side-chain interaction [14]. The additive method has been shown to be effective in modeling MHC-peptide binding for a range of human and mouse class I MHC molecules, and, using an iterative extension, also a set of human and mouse Class II alleles [14-17]. Additive method models not only provide more precise information about the binding reactions, but also demonstrated enhanced accuracy in the prediction of untested peptides compared to other prediction methods such as SYFPEITHI, BIMAS and RANKPEP [16,17].",

First, utilizing non-linearity, since properly chosen non-linear models can, in describing complex systems, often out-perform linear models. Second, the use of a more informative scheme for encoding amino acids since most immunoinformatic methods encode amino acids by their identities using indicator variables, information concerning similarities in physicochemical properties between the 20 amino acids is typically neglected.",

Originally, SVMs were developed for classification or qualitative modeling problems. With the introduction of an \u03b5-insensitive loss function, SVMs have been extended to solve nonlinear regression (or quantitative modeling) problems. In this study, we employed the SVM regression (SVR) technique to model MHC-peptide binding affinities for three mouse class I MHC alleles (H2-Db, H2-Kb and H2-Kk). We name this new modeling method SVRMHC. In SVRMHC models, peptides were described using a new 11-factor encoding scheme. This takes into account a number of important physicochemical parameters of the 20 amino acids (including hydrophobicity scale, polarity, isoelectric point, and accessible surface area). These SVRMHC models demonstrated consistently better performance than linear methods in terms of describing power, self-consistency, and prediction accuracy. Moreover, comparisons between our SVR models and several other popular prediction tools indicated that the SVRMHC models performed best in identifying strong binders to mouse class I MHC molecules.",

            "text": "For the training of the SVR models, one kernel parameter (\u03b3), and two kernel-independent parameters (\u03b5 and C) need to be determined (Eq.(5)). There are no commonly agreed methods for determining optimal SVR model parameters. In most published SVR studies we have examined, these model parameters were determined one at a time, by first fixing all other parameters, then letting the parameter take a range of different values, and thus identifying the value that corresponds to the best model performance assessed by cross-validation [20,21]. This method, though efficient in terms of execution time, disregards potential interactions between different model parameters. Cherkassky and Ma [22] advocated picking two of the three SVR model parameters (\u03b5 and C) from training data based on characterizations of the data, such as noise level and sample number. This method, though theoretically sound, did not, in our hands, always find the best set of parameters. In this study, we adopted a parameter selection procedure that combines the method of Cherkassky and Ma's with a grid-search. For \u03b5 and C, we first calculated the \"recommended value\" using Cherkassky and Ma's formulas, then searched a parameter range from 1/10th of the recommended value to 10 times the recommended value. The kernel parameter\u03b3 does not depend on the datasets. We picked a search range for \u03b3 as [0.001, 1], which safely covered the \u03b3 ranges commonly used in the literature [20,21,23]. After setting search ranges for the three parameters, we undertook a grid-search through the three-dimensional parameter space. For each parameter, four, six or eight equal-sized steps (on logarithm scale) were taken in the grid-search.",

The hope was that predictions could be made for these binding experiments using both the SVRMHC model and the other methods, and a concomitant comparison in prediction accuracy could be made. However, this strategy was not successful, because in most recently-published binding experiments pre-screening with prediction tools was used. This was most often SYFPEITHI and sometimes BIMAS [24-29]. Only the peptides predicted to be strong binders were tested experimentally, and peptides not predicted to be strong binders were disregarded. Moreover, false predictions (peptides predicted by SYFPEITHI or BIMAS to be strong binders but which were determined experimentally to be weak binders or non-binders) were sometimes not reported [24,26,27]. It is not surprising that prediction tools used in pre-screening (SYFPEITHI or BIMAS) always performed better in identifying good binders in these published studies (results not shown).",

For H2-Db, there were 28 strong binders and 44 weak binders, and for H2-Kb, there were 22 strong binders and 24 weak binders. No weak binders were retrieved for the H2-Kk, thus no ROC analysis was conducted for this allele. The scores generated by these different prediction methods have very different meanings. The scores produced by the SVRMHC models and the additive models are predicted pIC50 values, while scores from BIMAS are predicted half lives. RANKPEP outputs scores calculated from a PSSM (position-specific score matrix) profile. The scores produced by SYFPEITHI are nominal scores. They are generated by differentially scoring matches, within an individual peptide, to primary and secondary anchors within the target motif. Thus, they represent how close a particular peptide is to the expected pattern of a motif. The scores produced by SVMHC, on the other hand, are the distances between the peptides and the separating hyperplane defined by the SVM model. Despite the different meanings of these scores, they all roughly approximate increasing functions of predicted binding strength, therefore the areas under the ROC curves can be used as an objective measure of prediction performance.",

Quantitative prediction of exact peptide binding affinity represents the most recent development in the field. Quantitative prediction is a finer-scale description of binding, and the ability to construct effective quantitative models manifests an improved understanding of the mechanism of MHC-peptide interactions. There have been two reported approaches to quantitative prediction of MHC-peptide binding. The first approach makes use of 3D QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) techniques, and models the interaction between the peptide and the MHC molecule using CosMSIA (Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis) [33,34]. This approach, though accurate, requires structural knowledge about how the peptide and the MHC molecule interact with each other in 3D space. The second approach to quantitative modeling is the bioinformatics approach, including the additive method and the SVRMHC method presented here. In contrast to 3D-QSAR, this approach uses only peptide sequences as their input, and does not require any 3D structural information. This property makes the bioinformatics methods more straightforward and generally applicable. Particularly, they are more suitable for modeling the binding of less studied MHC molecules for which no 3D structural information is available.",

However, as is generally known, properly chosen non-linear models can often out-perform linear models in describing complex systems, although linear models can often be more intuitive and easily understood. Also, in many immunoinformatic techniques, including the additive method, amino acid residues are encoded by their identities, and the physicochemical properties of the amino acids are ignored. In this study, we have addressed both problems. The use of a non-linear SVR technique leads to an enhancement in predictivity. Meanwhile, the adoption of an 11-factor encoding of amino acids renders the resultant models sensitive to similarities in important physicochemical properties among the residues in the peptides being modeled.",

The models constructed with SVRMHC have been shown to be superior to those constructed with linear methods, in terms of descriptive power (as shown by a smaller number of \"outliers\"), prediction accuracy (manifest as a higher cross-validated correlation coefficient q2), self-consistency (higher non-cross-validated explained variance r2), and overall precision in prediction (lower average residual of the prediction). Although an improved performance was seen in all three SVRMHC models, the levels of improvement differed between the models constructed for the three MHC alleles. There seems to be a positive correlation between the amount of improvement achieved by the SVRMHC models and dataset size. With the largest of the three datasets \u2013 the H2-Kk dataset (154 peptides), the SVRMHC method demonstrated the greatest level of improvement. The LOO cross-validated q2 increased from 0.456 to 0.721. With the two smaller datasets \u2013 the H2-Db dataset (65 peptides) and the H2-Dk dataset (62 peptides) \u2013 the LOO cross-validated q2 increased from 0.401 and 0.454 for the additive models to 0.456 and 0.486 for the SVRMHC models, respectively, marking a smaller improvement than for H2-Kk. When we looked at the self-consistency measure, with the two larger datasets (H2-Kk and H2-Db), the SVRMHC models consistently demonstrated higher levels of self-consistency than the linear models for the entire datasets as well as for the datasets after removal of outliers. For the smallest dataset, H2-Dk, although the SVRMHC model produced a higher r2 than the corresponding linear model for the entire dataset (0.568 vs. 0.370); after outliers were removed, the SVRMHC model produced a lower r2 than the additive model did (0.970 vs. 0.989). The same trend is true for the AR measurement. For the two larger datasets (H2-Kk and H2-Db), the SVRMHC models consistently produced lower AR values than the additive models for both the entire datasets and for the datasets after removal of outliers. However, for the smallest dataset (H2-Dk), the SVRMHC model produced a lower AR than the additive model for the entire dataset (0.382 vs. 0.443), but a higher AR than the additive model after the removal of outliers (0.130 vs. 0.095). These observations suggest that the SVRMHC approach may become more accurate as datasets grow.",

There are disagreements in the outliers determined by the two methods following the same step-wise outlier determining procedure (Table 4): 4 out of the 6 \"outliers\" determined by SVRMHC were also identified as \"outliers\" by the additive method for H2-Kb; only 1 out of the 3 \"outliers\" determined by SVRMHC was classified as an \"outlier\" by the additive method for H2-Db. These disagreements suggest that this outlier detection procedure may not be most accurate in identifying \"true outliers\" that reflect experimental errors. However, the main focus of this study is to demonstrate the performance of the SVRMHC method in comparison with other methods, therefore, it is justifiable to follow the same data pre-processing procedure as for the additive method for the sake of performance comparison. It is worth noting that after the model construction, the performance of the models was also examined on the whole dataset with the \"outliers\" added back, and SVRMHC consistently demonstrated higher accuracy than the linear method in the models constructed for all three alleles (see Average Residual (entire dataset), Table 2).",

            "text": "It is interesting to investigate whether the performance improvement of SVRMHC over the additive method is primarily due to the SVR modeling technique, or it is primarily attributed to the 11-factor encoding scheme for the peptide sequences. We constructed SVR models with the \"sparse encoding\" scheme following the same outlier exclusion procedure as used in the additive models and the SVRMHC models, and compared the three in their performance. As shown in Table 5, the \"SVR + sparse encoding\" method showed prediction performance that is between those of the additive and the SVRMHC methods for two of the three alleles \u2013 H2-Db and H2-Kk. For H2-Db, \"SVR + sparse encoding\" achieved a similar LOO cross-validated q2 (0.459) to that of SVRMHC (0.456), but it excluded a larger number of outliers than SVRMHC (5 vs. 3). For H2-Kk, \"SVR + sparse encoding\" achieved a LOO cross-validated q2 of 0.523, which is between the LOO cross-validated q2 values of the additive (0.456) and SVRMHC method (0.721); and it excluded 1 outlier, also between the additive method (2 outliers excluded) and SVRMHC (no outlier excluded). This seems to suggest that both the SVR modeling technique and the 11-factor encoding scheme contributed to the superior performance of SVRMHC. However, we were surprised to see that the \"SVR + sparse encoding\" model for H2-Kb performed worse than both the SVRMHC model and the additive model (LOO cross-validated q2 = 0.352, with 8 outliers removed), which is difficult to interpret. In order to be conclusive on this issue, models for a larger number of alleles need to be constructed and used in comparison; and this we intend to do in the near future.",

Our ROC analysis indicated that the SVRMHC method, with an average AROC of 0.786, was the most accurate in identifying strong binders for the two mouse MHC molecules H2-Db and H2-Kb. It is followed by SYFPEITHI and the additive method (with average AROC = 0.727 and 0.726, respectively). SVMHC (average AROC = 0.704), BIMAS (average AROC = 0.695) and RANKPEP (average AROC = 0.621) were less accurate than the other three methods we compared.

Ideally, a comparison based on a totally independent dataset, one with no overlaps with the data used in the model construction of any of the five methods, would be desirable. However, without information about what peptides were used in the model construction of the SYFPEITHI, BIMAS, RANKPEP and SVMHC methods, we believe it likely that there are higher levels of overlaps between the datasets used in model construction of the three qualitative models than those used for the two quantitative methods \u2013 additive and SVRMHC \u2013 because qualitative data are much more abundant than quantitative binding data. Nevertheless, we removed all peptides in the test datasets that overlapped with the datasets used in the construction of the additive and SVRMHC models (15 peptides for H2-Db, and 11 peptides for H2-Kb) and conducted a ROC-based comparison using the remaining data (Table 6). This is a very \"unfair\" comparison, because overlapped peptides for the additive and SVRMHC models were removed, but those for the other methods were not. Yet, the results indicated that the SVRMHC model for H2-Kb (AROC = 0.83) still out-performed the models for all other methods; and the SVRMHC model for H2-Db, though did not achieve as high AROC as BIMAS (0.66) or RANKPEP (0.677), but was still close to them (0.658).",

However, such an encoding scheme does not account for any similarity in physicochemical properties between amino acids. We developed a new encoding method. First, from AA-index [41], we picked a list of what we considered as important general physicochemical properties (e.g., polarity, isoelectric point, and accessible surface area). Into this list, we added a number of properties that were identified in 3-D QSAR analysis [34] as key determinants of peptide-MHC interaction (volume, number of hydrogen bond donors, hydrophobicity). This led to a list of properties that consists of 17 physicochemical indices. We calculated the pair-wise correlation coefficients (r2) of these 17 factors. For any pair of factors with r2 > 0.8, we eliminated one of the two factors. In the end, a list of 11 factors was obtained. The values of the 11 physicochemical parameters were linearly scaled to the range [0, 1] for the 22 amino acids (Table 5). The list of the 17 factors and their pair-wise r2 are presented in online supplementary material [19]. As input to the SVRMHC models, a given octamer or nonamer peptide sequence is represented as a long vector concatenated from the eight or nine numerical vectors (each of length 11) encoding the corresponding residue in the sequence. We name this encoding scheme the \"11-factor encoding\".",
