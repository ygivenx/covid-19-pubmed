They are currently classified into four genera, the Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus, identified in diverse animal species including humans [2]. With its origin still unknown, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a recently emerged deltacoronavirus in swine. It particularly targets neonatal piglets, causing acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality [3\u20137]. In 2012, PDCoV was first identified in swine herds in Hong Kong and was subsequently reported as an enteric pathogen causing diarrhea in the United States in 2014 [2,3,7\u201311]. Shortly thereafter, PDCoV has been reported in South Korea, mainland China and Thailand [4,12,13]. Currently, PDCoV, together with other enteric viruses including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus (RV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is causing enormous economic losses in the swine industry worldwide [9,14].",

The genome organization is similar to those of other reported delta-CoVs with the typical gene order of: 5\u2032 UTR-ORF1a/1b-S-E-M-NS6-N-NS7-3\u2032 UTR [3,8,12]. ORF1a and ORF1b encode two large replicase precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, with the expression of the latter involving a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift mechanism [16]. According to studies on other CoVs, the replicase pp1a and pp1ab are generally cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into 15 non-structural proteins involved in viral transcription and replication. PDCoV encodes the traditional coronavirus structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein (S), the envelope protein (E), the membrane glycoprotein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). Although general characteristics of the coronaviral proteins and their roles in viral replication have been clarified, the detailed functions and roles of the proteins encoded by PDCoV in host cells and animals are still largely unknown.",

However, other alpha-CoVs such as human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), TGEV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) possess two, three and five accessory proteins, respectively [18\u201321]. For beta-CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), HCoV-OC43, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), each has five accessory proteins, while at least eight accessory proteins have been identified in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [22].

For example, replacement the ORF3 with the red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene in PEDV resulted in the partial attenuation of the virus in piglets [27]. Deletion of the ORF 6 in SARS-CoV also led to a significant attenuation in animal models [24]. Similarly, MHV and FIPV mutants bearing defective accessory protein genes were also dramatically attenuated when inoculated into their natural hosts [17,28]. Recently, PDCoV NS6, which is located between the M and N, and NS7, which is occupied within the N gene in an alternative ORF, were identified as the accessory proteins [29]. Moreover, NS7a, a 100-amino-acid-polypeptide identical to the C-terminus of NS7, has also been identified as a novel accessory protein [30]. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have addressed the role of PDCoV proteins, particularly the accessory proteins, in viral replication and pathogenicity.",

Notably, BsmBI is a type IIS restriction endonuclease that cleaves asymmetric DNA sequences (5\u2032-CGTCTCN\u2193NNNN-3\u2032) but leaves 4-nucleotide variable overhangs. Thus, these unique overhangs between each fragment allow for the systematic, directional, and efficient assembly of each fragment into the full-length genomic cDNA of PDCoV by in vitro ligation. In addition, three naturally occurring BsmBI restriction sites, separately located in fragment B, D, F, were removed by C-T changes at positions 6857, 15616, 23753, respectively. Notably, changes in BsmBI cutting sites gave rise to silent mutations, thereby not affecting protein products. The A fragment contains a T7 promoter, whereas the F fragment terminates in 20 A residues (Figure 1A), allowing the synthesized RNA transcripts with capped and polyadenylated structures as products of in vitro transcription.\n",

Within 48\u201372 h post-transfection, clear cytopathic effects were observed, and the recombinant-virus mRNA could be detected by RT-PCR within transfected cultures, but not in mock-infected cells (data not shown). Following three rounds of plaque purification, the infectivity of rPDCoV in LLC-PK1 cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) using nucleocapsid (N) protein-specific antibodies (Figure 1B). To examine the genomic identity of the rPDCoV, the genomic RNA of two plaque-purified clones were subject to nucleotide sequencing. As shown in Figure 1C and D, the entire genome sequences of rescued viruses were identical to the cDNA clone, including the genetic markers at position 6857, 15616, 23753 and the junctions between six fragments, thereby suggesting that the rPDCoV was successfully rescued in LLC-PK1 cells.",

Furthermore, the infectivity of mutant viruses in LLC-PK1 cells was confirmed by IFA staining using antibodies specific for the N, NS6, and NS7 protein, respectively. As expected, NS6 or NS7 expression was not detected in cells infected with mutants with disrupted NS6 or NS7, whereas N expression was apparent in those infected by all recombinant viruses (Figure 2C). Strong GFP signal was also detected in cells infected with rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP (Figure 2C), suggesting the viral sgmRNA corresponding to the GFP gene was expressed effectively. In addition, the NS6, NS7 and N proteins expression in the cell culture infected by various recombinant viruses were also examined by western blot analysis (Figure 2D), which were in congruence with results of the IFA. It is noteworthy that the expression of NS7a was also abolished in the rPDCoV-\u0394NS7-infected cells (Figure 2C) as its initiation codon was also altered (from ATG to ACG) in the rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 cDNA clone.

The growth kinetics of rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 resembled those of PDCoV and rPDCoV, reaching peak virus titers around 109 TCID50/ml at 36 h post-infection (Figure 3B). However, the viral titer of rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP in LLC-PK1 cells was approximately 10\u201370 fold lower relative to that of the wild-type virus (Figure 3B). A very similar growth pattern was also observed in infected IPI-2I cells (Figure 3C). To further explore whether the reduced viral yield of rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP was due to the absence of NS6 expression, we performed a complementation analysis in LLC-PK1 cells transiently expressing NS6 protein. Interestingly, cells transfected with the NS6-expressing plasmid exhibited significant enhancement of viral titers for both PDCoV and rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP, compared to those transfected with empty vector (Figure 3D). Taken together, these data indicated that the NS6 protein, but not NS7 protein, is critical for PDCoV replication in vitro.\n",

Within 2 days post-inoculation (DPI), all piglets orally fed with PDCoV-, rPDCoV-, and rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 experienced varying degrees of diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy, and anorexia (Table 1).

Currently, the role of accessory proteins in the replication of delta-CoVs are not clearly elucidated. Here, we employed the reverse genetics to construct recombinant PDCoVs with abortive NS6 or NS7 genes and demonstrated that both NS6 and NS7 were not essential for PDCoV replication in vitro (Figure 2C and D). In addition, we showed, using rPDCoV-\u0394NS7, that the NS7a, a newly identified accessory protein encoded by PDCoV [30], is also not required for efficient replication in LLC-PK1 cells. However, it is important to emphasize that while rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 with both NS7 and NS7a deletion exhibited similar growth kinetics with the parental virus in vitro, rPDCoV lacking the functional NS6 displayed markedly lower replication efficiency (Figure 3B and C). These data thus suggested that PDCoV accessory protein NS6, but not NS7, is very like play a key role in promoting viral replication.",

            "text": "Although dispensable for viral replication, coronavirus accessory proteins usually play pivotal roles in viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo. Menachery et al. reported that deletion of ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 in MERS-CoV led to a significant attenuation of the virus in mice [38]. On the other hand, newborn piglets infected with TGEV lacking protein 7 expression developed a faster and more pronounced clinical disease compared with the parental virus [39]. In this study, piglets infected with rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP showed minimal clinical signs, with significantly lower viral RNA copy numbers in small intestines compared with wild-type virus. In contrast, piglets orally fed with rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 exhibited clinical manifestations and pathological injury similar to those infected with the wild-type virus (Figures 4\u20136, Table 1). These results suggested that the NS6 protein is necessary for efficient viral replication in vivo, which may be attributable to the high pathogenicity of PDCoV. Recently, Fang et al. demonstrated that the PDCoV NS6 predominantly localize to the ER complex and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, which is the site of coronavirus assembly and packaging [29], suggesting that NS6 may be involved in virus assembly. Moreover, PDCoV NS6 was identified as an inhibitor of IFN-\u03b2 expression by interacting with RIG-I and MDA5 to impede their association with double-stranded RNA, thus disturbing RLR-mediated IFN-\u03b2 signal pathway [40]. It is thus probable that the NS6 protein might contribute to PDCoV pathogenesis by, at least in part, regulating virus-host interaction. Given that rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP is highly attenuated in vivo, it could be considered a promising vaccine candidate for PDCoV. Although immunological profiles of pigs inoculated with rPDCoV-\u0394NS6-GFP are still needed to fully support its applicability, our study here provides the basis for rational development of recombinant live attenuated PDCoV vaccines.",

All piglets were confirmed negative for PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV, and rotavirus by virus-specific RT-PCRs on rectal swabs. Neutralizing antibodies against PDCoV were not detected in sera of the piglets or sow. After 1 day acclimation, piglets were orally challenged with 10 ml of PDCoV, rPDCoV, rPDCoV -\u0394NS6-GFP, or rPDCoV-\u0394NS7 at a dose of 1.0 \u00d7 107 TCID50, while the mock-infected group was inoculated with 10 ml of maintenance medium. Piglets were monitored daily for the presence of vomiting and clinical signs of diarrhea, lethargy, and anorexia. Diarrhea severity was scored with the following criteria: 0, normal; 1, pasty stool; 2, semiliquid diarrhea; and 3, liquid diarrhea. Rectal swabs were collected daily for detecting virus shedding by a quantitative PDCoV N-gene based real-time RT-PCR. At 4 DPI, three piglets in each group were randomly selected and necropsied, the different sections of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) were collected for detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR and histopathological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Rectal swabs and tissue samples collection, RT-qPCR testing, and histopathology were performed as previously described [5]. To detect the inflammatory cytokines mRNA expressions in intestinal tissues, RT-qPCR was performed on the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Life Technologies, USA) using FastStart Universal SYBR@ Green Master Mix (Roche, Germany) with specific primers in Table 2. And the conditions as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s. Data were normalized to GAPDH expression and are expressed as fold differences using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.\n",
