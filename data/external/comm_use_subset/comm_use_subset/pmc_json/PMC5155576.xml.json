Subsequently, the fluorescence signal was divided into the individual cycles based on the captured temperature profile. The fluorescence amplitude during transition from extension/annealing step to denaturation step was then extracted for each cycle and fluorescence as function of temperature was plotted with cycle number as a parameter. MCA was formed by numerical differentiation of the fluorescence with respect to temperature and its negative value was plotted as a function of temperature. The melting curve captured at the first cycle was subtracted from all melting curves to suppress a background fluorescence effect we have observed. This background fluorescence could be caused by autofluorescence from the adjacent printed circuit board as well as fluorescence of the temperature dependence of the fluorophore as well as unspecific binding of the dye onto single stranded DNA16. PCR amplification curves were created by plotting amplitudes at the MCA of each amplicon as a function of the cycle number.",

Increasing the amount of NA added compared to HA lead to an even faster increase of the magnitude of peak at 68 \u00b0C (Fig. 3E,F). Extracting the fluorescence amplitude from the derived curves for each cycle at 68 \u00b0C and 76 \u00b0C respectively, results in two PCR amplification curves.

For all other experiments we were able to extract two amplification curves, one at a temperature of 68 \u00b0C and the second one at temperature of 76 \u00b0C. Threshold cycles (CT) were defined in the usual way. It was found that the difference in CT (\u2206CT) of the two curves corresponded to the expected difference according to the ratio of concentrations of HA and NA. An overview of all conducted experiments is presented in Table 1. The results indicate that \u2206CT corresponds to the expected values. We can then conclude that the method can be used for multiplexed quantitative PCR. As an example, (see Table 1) sample A5 has the concentration of NA 19 times higher than the concentration of HA. With 100% PCR efficiency one would expect a \u2206CT of 4.25 (log219). We have found the \u2206CTvalue to be 4.0 \u00b1 0.4 which is efficiency of 84%, reasonably close to the ideal value.",

Differentiation of amplicons with melting point differences \u0394Tm as small as 1.2 \u00b0C have been demonstrated in HRMCA.

Our approach allows researchers to perform affordable multiplex PCR using simple tools as well as reagents. Another advantage compared to conventional methods is small consumption of reagents due to small sample volume. Fluorescent amplitude sampling at rate above 100 samples per second is, however, required for constructing MCA during transition from annealing/extension to denaturation. This method might be particularly interesting for determination of serotype of virus such as dengue fever or an avian influenza. Other potential applications include measurement of viral loads in a sample, differentiation between H7N9 and H7N5, and quantitative detection of co-infections. We have experimentally verified the method using a homemade PCR system primarily for convenience as we have 100% control of the tool. In principle any commercial real-time PCR device would be capable of performing the same protocol as long as it has available fluorescent amplitude sampling rate of 1kHz or higher and can process samples with small volume of a 1 \u03bcL or below.",
