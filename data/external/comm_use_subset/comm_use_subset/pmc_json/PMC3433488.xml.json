[34] Briefly, individuals with cancer experience some or all of the following health states: diagnosis (good, fair, or poor prognosis), treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and certain combinations of those options), remission (after one or more treatment modalities), and if death occurs within five years, palliative care and terminal care (last month of life) attributable to the cancer. We obtained stage distributions at diagnosis (i.e., proportion of individuals diagnosed at a particular stage) from the OCR for 2007 and 2008. Five-year relative survival estimates and treatment distributions were determined from epidemiologic studies and expert opinion. We made several simplifying assumptions. The first was that all incident cases underwent some form of treatment. In reality, some patients are too frail at diagnosis to receive treatment, but the proportion not undergoing any treatment is generally small. Second, we simplified the treatment options by not distinguishing between curative and palliative radiation therapy and by not considering chemotherapy associated with mild, moderate, and severe toxicity (keeping the mild form only). Third, we assumed that only deaths that occurred within five years of diagnosis were attributable to the cancer (i.e., those who survived past five years due to another diagnosis), and those who survived past five years had a life expectancy that was the same as the rest of their age-sex stratum. Fourth, we assumed that the proportion dying within five years was independent of the type(s) of treatment and that those who died experienced on average 2.25 years in remission (five years minus the time spent in palliative (five months) and terminal care (one month) divided by two = 4.5 years/2 = 2.25 years). Fifth, we assumed the reduction in functioning to be similar when in remission, regardless of the treatment modality (or modalities) employed. Finally, we did not consider recurrent cancers.

Important synergies exist between infectious diseases; notably, HIV can interact with other infectious diseases in terms of natural history and transmissibility. [41] While ONBOIDS is the most comprehensive examination of infectious diseases to our knowledge, the study was not exhaustive. We excluded certain pathogens (e.g., norovirus), syndromes (e.g., surgical site infections), and health states (e.g., amputations due to serious infection). The most significant exclusions may have been the oncogenic pathogens Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr virus, given our finding that other oncogenic pathogens are among the most burdensome infectious agents. We also were unable to assess many milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization, or take a societal perspective in assessing the impact of outbreaks (e.g., economic, psychological). Other important limitations include: the uncertain validity of the diagnostic codes for ascertaining infectious diseases; the assumption that etiologic agent distributions from studies of non-fatal outcomes also apply to fatal outcomes; reliance on a single underlying cause of death, which may have led to underestimation of the true burden of infectious diseases (e.g., deaths hastened or precipitated by infectious diseases would likely be attributed to pre-existing conditions); and the missed burden of undiagnosed infections. Finally, data were extracted from multiple sources of varying quality. Further details concerning the limitations of this work are described in the ONBOIDS technical report.",

However, these findings are likely generalizable to other high-income settings. In translating findings such as these into policy, decision-makers must appreciate the \u201cherd-dynamic\u201d aspects of infectious diseases, such that, for example, funding for highly successful vaccination programs is not diverted towards the high-impact diseases identified here. The communicable nature of vaccine-preventable diseases means that ongoing investment is necessary to maintain existing successes. Also, while novel interventions (e.g., new vaccines) are required to further reduce the burden of infectious diseases, much of the burden can already be reduced by improved implementation of existing interventions (e.g., hand hygiene, improved vaccine uptake, safe injection sites). Setting priorities requires knowledge of disease burden as well as critical evaluation of the feasibility, cost, and impact of available interventions, and knowledge translation for decision-makers.
