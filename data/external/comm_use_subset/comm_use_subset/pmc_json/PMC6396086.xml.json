Here, we investigate the function of the IFITM family in CD4+ Th cell differentiation. We show that Ifitm2 is rapidly upregulated following T\u2010cell activation, and that IFITM proteins promote Th2 differentiation and inhibit Th1 differentiation in a T\u2010cell intrinsic manner. In the absence of IFITM proteins, the Th2 response is diminished in allergic airway disease, reducing the severity of disease, but deletion of Ifitm3 alone does not reduce disease severity. These findings demonstrate an important role for IFITM proteins in adaptive immunity, in the cell\u2010intrinsic regulation of CD4+ Th differentiation and fate.",

This time\u2010course analysis showed that Ifitm1 was expressed at low levels throughout the time course in all conditions. At the start of the experiment, Ifitm3 was most highly expressed of the three genes, but it was then rapidly downregulated after 4 h in response to the TCR/CD28 stimulus. In contrast, after an initial downregulation, expression of Ifitm2 increased to above resting levels, with highest expression overall in Th1 skewing conditions. Expression of all three Ifitm1\u20133 genes was lower in the Th2 culture conditions than Th0 and Th1 conditions from 4 h after stimulation onwards, consistent with the fact that they are IFN response genes, and that the Th2 skewing culture conditions include an anti\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b3 mab. Ifitm5 was below detection, whereas Ifitm6 was expressed at very low levels in resting CD4+ T cells and rapidly downregulated after 4 h to below detection levels in all culture conditions.",

The first principal component axis (PC1), which accounted for 52.7% of variability within the dataset, separated the samples by genotype (Fig. 1D). We then identified genes\u2010of\u2010interest, by intersecting the 1000 genes that contributed most to PC1 with the 920 DEG (Fig. 1E; Supporting Information Table 1). This intersection included genes for the costimulatory molecule CD27, which can sensitize na\u00efve T cells to Th1 differentiation through interactions with CD70 on APC, and the transcription factor Stat1, which plays an important role in IFN\u2010\u03b3 signal transduction 16, 17 (Fig. 1E). Given that Cd27 and Stat1 are both involved in the Th1 response, we examined expression of other genes known to be associated with Th1 or Th2 responses 18. We found significant increase in expression in the IfitmF\n\u2013/\u2013 CD4+ T cells compared to WT of Th1\u2010associated genes such as Cd84, Cd226, and Cd154 and also Il27ra, which signals for Stat1 activation during early Th1 differentiation 19, 20, 21, whereas there was no difference in expression levels of the master Th1 transcription factor Tbx21 between genotypes (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, expression of the Th2\u2010associated genes Il4ra, ICOS, Irf4, and the Th2\u2010transcription factor Gata3 were significantly lower in the IfitmF\n\u2013/\u2013 cells (Fig. 1F). Thus, the transcriptome data suggested an overall reduction in expression of Th2\u2010associated genes and a tendency toward increased expression of Th1\u2010associated genes in the IfitmF\n\u2013/\u2013 CD4+ T cells compared to WT (Fig. 1F).",

The scale was generated from the thousand most DEG (by eBayes) between Th1 and Th2 CD4+ T cells in publically available whole genome transcriptome data derived from Th\u2010skewed cultures (GEO: GSE14308).

In Th1 skewing conditions, the percentage of Tbet+ cells was also significantly higher in IfitmF\n\u2013/\u2013 compared to WT CD4+ T cells, showing enhanced commitment to the Th1 lineage, whereas there was no difference in Tbet expression under Th2 condition (Fig. 2B\u2013C).

This experiment together with the gene expression studies suggests that deletion of Ifitm3 alone does not predispose CD4+ T cells to Th1 differentiation. To confirm this in vivo, we induced allergic airways disease by intranasal papain administration, and monitored cell infiltration into the lungs and BAL. There were no significant differences in the numbers of eosinophils, DC, and neutrophils in the BAL and lung. In contrast to the papain\u2010treated IfitmF\n\u2013/\u2013 mice, we did, however, find a significant reduction in the number of macrophages in the Ifitm3\n\u2013/\u2013 BAL and of macrophages and neutrophils in the papain\u2010treated Ifitm3\n\u2013/\u2013 lung compared to WT (Fig. 6G\u2013H). Finally, there were not significant differences in the number of T cells (Fig. 6I\u2013K) or in the number of CD4+T1ST2+ cells (Fig. 6L) in BAL, lung, or mLN. Overall, we found no evidence for Th1 bias in Ifitm3\n\u2013/\u2013 mice, whereas deletion of the Ifitm family reduced induction of allergic airways disease and the Th2 response.",

In support of this, we found no impact of Ifitm3 deficiency alone on IFN\u2010\u03b3 production or Th1 differentiation, and on induction of allergic airways disease; there was no significant impact of Ifitm3 deficiency on Th2 effector populations or on eosinophil or mast cell infiltration of the lung.

As IFITM proteins are transmembrane proteins that are found in intracellular and plasma membranes, the way in which their deletion has such a profound influence on the pattern of transcription is not immediately clear. However, membrane fusion studies have suggested that IFITM proteins block early steps of viral replication by influencing the molecular order of membranes and membrane fluidity 11. Interestingly, plasma membrane lipid order may also be an important factor that influences Th differentiation. High membrane order is related to Th2 differentiation, with higher production of IL\u20104, whereas intermediate membrane order is present in Th1 cells secreting IFN\u2010\u03b331.",
