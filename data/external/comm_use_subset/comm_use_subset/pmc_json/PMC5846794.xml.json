            "text": "Proteomics, the large scale analysis of proteins, is feasible thanks to the availability of different technologies, such as mass spectrometry, gel-based techniques, antibody-based arrays and recently developed aptamer-based technologies [1\u20133]. Despite these technological improvements, the extraction of knowledge from the data produced is still challenging and the development of data analysis workflows capable of providing additional insight compared to traditional methods would be highly advantageous. In particular, a first desirable outcome is the identification of accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers suitable for subject stratification, which would shorten the path to the application of precision medicine concepts to the clinical practice [4\u20136]. Another highly desirable outcome is a better understanding of the disease on the basis of the newly available proteomic profiles. For this second aim a systems biology approach based on network analysis would enable integration of highly descriptive disease biomarkers with existing knowledge and potentially provide additional insight on the affected biological processes [7\u20139]. In this work we introduce an approach to achieve both these aims using recently published proteomics data obtained from a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) cohort. DMD is a rare disease caused by mutations in the gene that encodes dystrophin. The main clinical feature observed in DMD patients is the presence of muscular damage coupled with chronic inflammation that leads to a progressive muscular degeneration and fibrosis. The average age of diagnosis is usually at four-five years, when the symptoms appear and the disability starts to arise [10]. The availability of disease biomarkers that can be assessed using simple, non-invasive techniques would be useful to better understand the biological pathways altered in the disease and could be used for an early diagnosis. To this second end, serum creatine kinase (CK) level is usually evaluated. However, blood CK concentration shows high variability because it is influenced by age of the child, physical activity extent and pharmacological treatments [11]. In our study we employed an optimized version of the rank-based classification algorithm introduced in [12,13] to identify two biomarker panels based on SomaLogic profiles of DMD patients and controls and characterize their classification performance. We then used the panels as the starting point of an analysis aimed at identifying the biological pathways altered in the disease. To circumvent the limitation represented by the relatively short list of proteins measurable in blood with the SomaLogic array, we resorted to a network-based systems biology approach to identify a list of biological processes that are affected in DMD. Therefore a first contribution of our study is the identification of accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers suitable for subject stratification. Another contribution is a better understanding of the disease in terms of pathways identified as affected on the basis of the altered serum proteomic profiles.",

The biomarker discovery algorithm identifies subject-specific lists of proteins, herein called signatures, which are then compared in order to classify each subject as belonging to one of the two classes (affected or controls). The aggregation of the individual signatures produces a list of proteins useful for subject classification and we refer to it as a \u2018biomarker panel\u2019. Since the method can be tuned to obtain panels of different lengths, we applied it twice with different settings to obtain two biomarker panels, as shown in Fig 1. The shorter one was obtained specifically for classification purposes, while the longer one was derived to identify the biological processes affected by the disease. Specifically, we used the proteins in the long biomarker panel as input to the network-based tool NASFinder that identified functional modules from the sub-networks connecting biomarker proteins to known transcription factors.",

Overall, we determined that individual signatures formed of just two proteins out of a panel of six were satisfactory to discriminate DMD patients from controls with perfect accuracy (averaged over all the cross-validation rounds) and permutation test p-value < 0.001. These six protein epitopes correspond to the following genes: CA3, CD55, CDH5, CKB/CKM, FGG and TNNI2 (Table 1). Principal component analysis performed on the dataset containing only data about these six proteins confirmed the separation between DMD patients and controls according to the main axis of variation (S1 Fig). The contribution of each protein in achieving a control/affected classification is illustrated in Fig 2. The heatmap of the measured protein levels shows that no single protein level highly correlates with a partition of the subjects in two groups (Fig 2A). Signatures of length two, as those selected by our method for inclusion in the short panel (Fig 2B, red boxes), are sufficient to correctly identify the control/affected status of each individual. As an intermediate step, our algorithm computes a complete distance matrix based on the similarity between each pair of subject signatures (shown in the form of a heatmap in Fig 2C). As an aid in interpreting the distance matrix, a map of the subjects is drawn by using the shortest N = 20% distances, with colors added afterwards according to control/affected status. In this case, the map clearly shows the emergence of two well-defined groups, with subject perfectly segregated by disease status (Fig 2D).",

Also troponin is a muscle\u2013specific protein involved in regulating muscle contraction and it was found in blood after prolonged exercise [15].

After having verified that the age distribution in patients is not significantly different from controls (p-value of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: 0.82; Fig 4), we tested the presence of a relationship between age and protein levels. We identified 31 proteins whose serum level changes significantly with age. The top 5 proteins are shown in Fig 4 and the full list of biomarker proteins is shown in S2 Fig and S2 Table. With two exceptions, in all cases the protein levels decreased with age in DMD patients while they remain stable in controls. Nine of them showed a significant age-related change also in controls but the variation observed in the two groups was different and did not affect their separation (S3 Fig). These results are not unexpected since the disease is known to affect protein levels along its progression and this change has been related to the progressive loss of muscle mass [20]. Given the presence in the cohort of 28 DMD subjects treated with steroids, we checked if the treatment influenced the protein levels and 32 proteins of the biomarker panel resulted significantly associated with the treatment, indicating proteins potentially affected by the drug (S4 Fig). Despite the presence in the dataset of patients treated with steroids and patients not treated, this did not affect the classification (S5 Fig).",

The analysis with hallmark gene sets confirmed the over-representation of skeletal muscle proteins with a significant enrichment for \u201cmyogenesis\u201d gene set (BH corrected p-value 0.000304). The genes coding the biomarker proteins present in the \u201cmyogenesis\u201d gene set are: TNNI2, CKM, TPM2, FABP3, MAPK12, GSN, MB, CKB, NOTCH1 and CAMK2B. In addition to the muscle-related biological functions, Biocarta pathway analysis revealed the presence of proteins involved in the coagulation cascade and pointed out the presence of different signaling pathways differentially regulated in DMD individuals compared with controls (Table 3). In particular, significantly enriched Biocarta pathways included different gene sets related to insulin receptor\u2014PI3K/Akt pathway (igf1-mtor pathway, akt pathway and igf1r pathway), consistent with the already described role of PI3K/Akt in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy [22,23].",

In our workflow we applied NASFinder, a network analysis tool we recently developed [14]. Specifically, we mapped on a global signaling interaction network the 52 proteins in the biomarker panel and we identified the sub-networks connecting these proteins with transcription factors (TF). We opted for the use of TF as source nodes because they are at the top of signaling and regulatory cascades. The connections between TF and proteins of interest were established by NASFinder preferentially through differentially expressed proteins (see details in Materials and Methods). To identify the biological processes associated with the disease regulatory circuits we performed a network-based pathway enrichment analysis. The significant pathways are reported in Table 4 together with the transcription factors that NASFinder identified as the most probable regulators. On the whole, the resulting gene sets are partially overlapping, as shown in Fig 5 and S3 Table, suggesting the presence of a shared regulated biological process that involves multiple pathways. Indeed, only myogenesis did not show genes in common with other pathways and, as a confirmation of its peculiarity, the transcription factor selected as putative regulator was MEF2C, a transcription activator specific of muscle genes. In the enrichment map it is interesting to observe the centrality of BioCarta BAD pathway, a gene set related to the regulation of the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD. Among the regulators of the sub-networks the Forkhead family of transcription factors was the most represented with 3 members: FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4. They were respectively identified as regulators of the sub-networks enriched in genes involved in acute myocardial infarction pathway, cancer pathways, neurotrophin signaling and immune system pathway. In particular, eleven proteins in the NASFinder FOXO3 sub-network are present in the neurotrophin pathway (p-value = 1.34 x 10\u22127). Seven of them (corresponding to the genes CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D, FASLG, MAPK12, PIK3CA and PIK3R1) derived from the biomarker while the others (NFKB1, FOXO3, MAPK3 and PIK3CG) were added by NASFinder on the basis of the differentially expressed proteins. It is interesting to observe that 7 proteins (coded by the genes MAPK12, CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D, MAPK3, PIK3CA and PIK3R1) were also identified in the Reactome immune system pathway (p-value = 0.003).",

Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, although none was significant after multiple test correction, some of the most enriched pathways are shared between the two studies (see S5 Table).

            "text": "In this study we adopted a system biology approach to study Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Our workflow is based on the combination of two complementary methodologies: biomarker identification and network analysis. We applied the algorithm for biomarker identification to point out the essential features of the biological system, i.e. the minimum set of proteins able to fully separate healthy from affected subjects, and then we applied the network analysis to unravel the complex interactions among the proteins. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our algorithm, we calculated two different protein lists, a short one and a long one. All the proteins present in the short biomarker panel have been already described as DMD biomarkers in Hathout et al. [20] and they are related to the main pathological features observed in DMD [6]. However, the short biomarker panel described here, compared with the signature in Hathout et al. [20], has the advantage of being able to classify the subjects with only six proteins achieving perfect accuracy and high statistical significance (permutation test p-value < 0.001). Our long biomarker panel has size comparable to the disease signature reported in Hathout et al. (52 vs 46 proteins, respectively) but only approximately half of the proteins (26) are in common between the two lists. Such low overlap is not surprising in view of the fact that the different approaches used in the two studies (classification-oriented vs statistical significance) have been shown not to be equivalent [30]. From an investigational point of view, our classification-oriented list provides some additional insights on less known aspects of the disease pathophysiology and in particular to identify deregulated pathways and potential regulators. Indeed, in addition to proteins with a muscle origin, likely found in the serum proteome as a consequence of sarcolemma leakage [31], our analysis pointed out several proteins involved in cell signaling that, given their biological role, it is not surprising to detect in blood serum. Our results are in line with growing evidences suggesting that the cellular structural instability caused by the lack of dystrophin affects different signaling pathways [32\u201334]. In particular, the network-based pathway enrichment analysis implemented in NASFinder identified nine pathways as significantly enriched and, among the influential nodes, different transcription factors belonging to the FoxO family were identified as possible regulators. In humans FoxO proteins are all expressed in skeletal muscle and they have been implicated in muscle homeostasis [35]. Specifically, regarding muscle mass, FoxO proteins were shown to enhance proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome system [36]. Notably, a study on sarcopenia, the physiological age-related loss of muscle mass, identified FOXO3 as an up-regulated gene in muscles from old subjects [37] and another study found increased FOXO1 mRNA in aged muscle [38]. However, findings from a more recent study suggest that sarcopenia is not due to FoxO activation [39], highlighting the need for further studies to better understand the role of FoxO proteins in physiological and pathological muscle conditions. Among the sub-networks regulated by FoxO proteins, the neurotrophin signaling pathway, a cascade of biological processes regulating cell survival and apoptosis [40], was identified as enriched in our analysis. Although neurotrophins have been mainly linked to the nervous system [41], recent studies indicated their involvement in skeletal muscle adaptation and regeneration [42]. Specifically, experimental evidences showed that neurotrophins are involved in muscle regeneration in dystrophic mice [43] and the nerve growth factor, the paradigm of neurotrophin family, was identified in muscles from patients affected by DMD [44]. Interestingly, a recent study performed using the mdx mouse, a model of DMD, linked apoptosis of myofibers to the presence of connexin, a protein channel involved in NF-\u03baB activation, iNOS expression and apoptotic cell death [45]. In our analysis NFKB1, a DNA binding subunit of the NFKB protein complex, is present in the FOXO3 sub-network defined by NASFinder and the protein is part of the neurotrophin-related signaling. The network proximity analysis (Fig 6) suggested that the dysregulation of the neurotrophin signaling pathway in patients affected by DMD might be mediated by Fas ligand (FASLG), a mediator of the cellular apoptotic signal that is a direct interactor of the dystrophin protein [46]. A link between Duchenne muscular dystrophy and FASLG has already been reported by Abdel-Salam et al. [47], which observed significantly increased levels of FasLG mRNA expression in blood of DMD patients compared to controls. In addition to neurotrophin signaling, our analysis pointed out, among the FoxO-related sub-networks, an enrichment for the immune system signaling with FOXO4 identified as a regulator. The role of FoxO proteins in immune system has been already described [48] and interestingly, this process, together with hemostasis, another significant pathway in NASFinder analysis, is a key player in fibrosis, a prominent feature of dystrophic muscle [49]. It is thus conceivable that the dysregulation of blood proteins belonging to these pathways is a consequence of the fibrotic process ongoing in muscles of DMD patients. Notably, modulation of the immune response was suggested as a potential means to alleviate the disease intensity [50]. The other FoxO transcription factor with a pathway enriched sub-network was FOXO1. In this case two pathways resulted enriched: BioCarta acute myocardial infarction and KEGG pathways in cancer. While the presence of cardiac dysfunctions in subjects affected by DMD is common [51], we consider the presence of enrichment in cancer pathways (also KEGG glioma in TP53 network resulted enriched) a consequence of the bias introduced by the high number of genes annotated in cancer pathways. Indeed, we noticed that most of the genes in cancer pathways also belong to other enriched gene sets (S3 Table).",

This methodology allowed us to identify different pathways deregulated in the disease and to pinpoint a putative role of FoxO signaling in DMD. One limitation of this study is the lack of validation of the biomarker panel classification performance using a second independent cohort of subjects. To partially address this issue and avoid overfitting, we trained the algorithm that computed the biomarkers according to a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. We also used a second dataset of a very different nature (transcriptional profile of muscle from an unrelated cohort) to confirm the end results of our analysis and we obtained a substantial confirmation of the results. Another limitation of this study, as any form of in silico analysis, is that it relies entirely on observational data. Therefore, our results will have to be validated by means of functional studies. Despite these limitations, our workflow derives its strength from the convergence of multiple types of evidences from independent experiments, crossed with existing knowledge about the biology of the disease.",

For each subject a proteomic profile was obtained using the SOMAscan technology by SomaLogic. Briefly, this high throughput method is based on the use of aptamers with high affinity for the proteins. The presence in the aptamers of a DNA sequence allows the quantification of the protein levels in a simple way using microarray-based technology. Further details about the cohort and the proteomic assay can be obtained from [20].

Briefly, after a preliminary protein selection phase based on the Wilcoxon test, the classification method ranks the filtered proteins by expressions level separately for each sample and then it produces a set of subject-specific signatures, where each signature is the list of the first n1 and the last n2 proteins in the ranking (n1 and n2 have the same value for all subjects and they are parameters estimated by the method). An all-to-all signature comparison is then carried out using a distance metric based on a weighted enrichment score [52], resulting in a distance matrix that systematically quantifies the degree of similarity between the subjects. Subjects are then classified by the algorithm into the two groups of controls and diseased, by assigning each sample to the group of subjects whose elements have the lowest averaged distance from the sample. Finally, a protein biomarker is extracted, which collects all the proteins included in at least one subject-specific signature. Therefore, the proteins included in a biomarker are those required to compute the corresponding subject classification.",

Briefly, the proteins in the biomarker panel are mapped to a reference protein-protein interaction network, that is, the human signaling network from the Wang Lab - http://www.cancer-systemsbiology.org/dataandsoftware.htm. Then, the subnetwork connecting the proteins of interest, in our case the proteins in the biomarker panel, and the closest transcriptional factor (molecules selected as regulators) is defined. If a protein of interest is not present in the reference network it is added, if possible, from BioGRID [58] as detailed in [14]. The paths that connect transcription factors and biomarker proteins are established by NASFinder preferentially through differentially expressed proteins and they were identified in our study using the Bioconductor package limma. Specifically, proteins were selected as significant when they showed a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value less than 0.05 in the comparison between DMD subjects and controls. Once the subnetworks were identified, we evaluated their overlap with reference pathways from KEGG, Reactome, Biocarta and the hallmark collection in MSigDB, as in the gene-set enrichment analysis. The significance of the overlap was calculated using one-sided Fisher's exact test. The degree of overlap among the pathways identified by NASFinder was visualized using the Cytoscape App Enrichment Map v2.1.0 [59], run using Cytoscape 3.4.0. Enrichment Map was run using default parameters and Overlap coefficient as a measure of similarity.",

This background network was preferred to the signaling network used for the identification of pathways and regulators because it includes only physical interactions among proteins instead of regulatory interactions. For all the pathways, all the shortest paths from DMD to the genes were calculated and the shortest path distance was defined as the minimal distance found. To assess the significance, we selected 1000 random genes and, for each of them, we calculated the minimal shortest distance to the pathway. We thus obtained an empirical distribution that was used to calculate the proportion of samples with a minimal shortest distance less or equal to the distance obtained using DMD.",
