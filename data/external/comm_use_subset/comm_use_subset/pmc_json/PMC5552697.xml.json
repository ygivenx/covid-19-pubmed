In North America, it is estimated that at least 79% of reportable domestic animal diseases have a putative wildlife component associated with the transmission, maintenance, or life cycle of the pathogen and at least 40% are zoonotic3. Similarly three-fourths of all emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of humans are zoonotic with most originating from wildlife reservoirs4, 5. Therefore, diseases that arise from the livestock\u2013wildlife interface are of paramount importance and must be an area of focus for public and veterinary health systems6. Despite this importance cross-species transmission is one of the least studied aspects of disease ecology7, 8.",

Recently, wild pigs in North America have become of increasing concern as a potential veterinary and public health threat for cross-species transmission9, 10. Research and policy addressing wild pig disease has received increased attention in recent years9\u201311. This is driven, in part, by substantial range expansion, increasing ecological and agricultural damage, and increased involvement of wild pigs in disease transmission9. In North America, wild pigs have expanded their range to at least 41 states in the United States and three provinces in Canada since the 1960s9, 10, 12 and recent modeling indicates that their potential range may be far greater13.",

A recent evaluation of 80,000 publications addressing wildlife-livestock diseases found that only 18% of the publications addressed the domestic swine interface and that this may be an important knowledge gap given global increases in swine production31. While there have been numerous system specific studies investigating the role of wild pigs in pathogen transmission these studies are primarily limited to diseases of concern for domestic swine production14, 16 or human health25, 26. As a result there is not currently an assessment across all economically important pathogens known to infect swine (domestic and wild) and the potential transmission of these pathogens between wild pigs, livestock, poultry, wildlife, and humans. Here, our objectives are three fold. First, we identify economically important pathogens (bacterial, viral, and parasitic) that are potentially shared between wild pigs, livestock, poultry, cervids, and humans. Second, we evaluate the reported prevalence of these pathogens in North American wild pig populations to assess any potential gaps in knowledge. Third, to illustrate the importance of disease risk management, we investigate the number of farms potentially at risk in the United States.",

Each of these 84 pathogens was evaluated using the published literature to determine its reported ability to infect swine (wild and domestic), cattle, sheep, goats, horses, poultry, cervids (North American deer and elk species only), and humans. A priori we identified and used nine susceptibility categories to characterize the outcome of infection in each of these host species (Table 1). Using these susceptibility categories the scientific literature was reviewed for each pathogen and based on this literature each host was assigned to the a-priori categories. A detailed description of the search criteria used are included in the supplemental. The final set of classified pathogens by host was then reviewed independently by five veterinary epidemiologists to achieve consensus based on the supporting evidence for each assigned category (details also provided in the supplemental material). This independent review reduced potential bias that maybe associated with the literature search. Where possible, we used literature to confirm whether wild and domestic swine were equally susceptible to pathogens. When literature was unavailable to discern any differences between wild and domestic swine (the case with most pathogens) we assumed that domestic swine and wild pigs were similarly affected. We summarized these data to describe the number of pathogens each species was susceptible.\n",

Thus edges are not equivalent to networks based on contact patterns. Edges in our transmission networks depict the potential for transmission between host species based on known etiology and host range for the pathogen rather than pathogen co-occurrence in space and time34, 36, 37. We define transmission potential to mean the likelihood that a given host species group will infect another species group, relative to other species in the network, based on species susceptibility to the pathogen. Thus, connected species form part of the same transmission chain7, 34, 37. Using methods similar to Pilosof, et al.34 we generated TPNs for two general cases, 1) host pairs were both clinically susceptible and 2) host pairs were clinically or subclinically susceptible. For the first case, TPNs defined edges if two host types were clinically susceptible to the same pathogen and were constructed for all pathogens, and separately for bacterial pathogens, viral pathogens, and parasitic pathogens resulting in four TPNs. For the second case, TPNs defined edges if two host types were clinically or subclinically affected by the same pathogen and were also generated for all pathogens, bacterial pathogens, viral pathogens, and parasitic pathogens resulting in four TPN.",

Our objective was not to identify all papers reporting pathogen findings but rather to generate a representative sample that could be used to determine pathogens that have existing surveillance studies. To achieve this objective, first we used keywords to search three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for papers reporting surveillance results, pathology, and case reports for wild pigs for any pathogen43, 45, 46. We confined our search to the literature published in English since 1900. All scientific peer reviewed literature describing any wild pig pathogens in North America was considered eligible (details regarding the search criteria are included in the supplemental material). We assumed that these papers represented the known status of pathogens in swine in North America. Once all relevant sources were identified and retrieved, we reviewed each paper to ensure relevance. The numbers of papers reporting pathogen findings in wild pigs were tallied by pathogen to determine variability in known pathogen occurrence in wild pigs. We report the number of studies and the range of reported prevalence for pathogens in the North America.",

A measure of the annual co-occurrence was developed using three data sources. Data reporting the number of farms by agricultural commodity and county was compiled from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Quick Stats database47. We restricted our investigation to the livestock commodities (species) listed in Table 2 (i.e. domestic swine, cattle, sheep, goat, cervids, equine, and poultry). The county-level number of farms is available at a national scale for 2002, 2007, and 2012. For completeness, we included rural human population as a proxy for potential human-wild pig interaction. County-level estimates of rural human population are available from the 2010 census48. The county level distribution (presence/absence) of wild pigs, were compiled from the Southeast Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS)49. The SCWDS data represent the known distribution of wild pig populations from 1982 until present. These data were merged to generate a database describing at the county-level the number of farms, rural human population size, and the presence or absence of wild pigs. We used only the 2010 census because it was closest to the mid-point of the wild pig data and changes in rural populations were small (mean = 0.29%) and bounded zero (range \u22120.07 to 0.74%) from 2012 to 2013 providing a good approximation of rural populations50. The national proportion of farms and rural populations co-occurring with wild pigs was then calculated for the years 2002, 2007, and 2012. We estimated the increase in the number of farms and human populations co-occurring with wild pigs using linear regression.\n",

Of these 39 pathogens affecting swine, 33 (85%) caused clinical disease while only a few (4; 10%) were categorized as causing asymptomatic (or subclinical) infection or had documented natural infections in swine with unknown consequences in (2; 5%). Our assessment of all species\u2019 susceptibility to pathogens of swine found that of these 39 pathogens, 34 (87.2%) caused clinical or sub-clinical disease in at least one other species. On average 70% (\u00b125%; \u00b1StDev) of swine pathogens could infect other species (Table 3). Specifically, non-swine hosts were susceptible (clinical, subclinical, affected, and occasionally affected) to 80% (\u00b132%) of bacterial, 56% (\u00b113%) of viral, and 73% (\u00b124%) of swine parasitic pathogens. All species except for poultry were susceptible to greater than 75% of bacterial pathogens. All species except poultry and cervids were susceptible to more than 75% of parasites; humans had the greatest number, being susceptible to 100% of parasites evaluated. Susceptibility to swine viral pathogens was the lowest among other host species with Bovidae (cattle, sheep, goat) being the most susceptible (>60%) to swine viral pathogens (see Table 2). On average 73% (\u00b129%) of bacterial, 39% (\u00b113%) of viral, and 63% (\u00b120%) of swine parasitic pathogens caused clinical disease in other species. All species except poultry and cervids had greater than 75% of swine bacterial pathogens causing clinical disease. Humans accounted for the greatest proportion of swine viral pathogens causing clinical disease (88%) while cattle, humans, and horses accounted for the greatest number of parasitic pathogens causing clinical disease. We also documented studies that specifically investigated wild pigs for susceptibility to domestic swine diseases. Nearly all 8 (80%) of the bacterial diseases had been investigated using wild pigs.

The majority (87%) of swine pathogens can be transmitted to other species; however this transmission potential was not evenly distributed across species. Both the co-occurrence of wild pigs with family Bovidae (cattle, sheep, goat) and the importance of these species in the transmission networks indicate a risk for transmission between Bovidae species and wild pigs. Bovidae had the highest network metrics indicating greater relative importance among the species and across all swine pathogens. Central nodes are often interpreted in epidemiological networks as being important for network wide transmission7, 58, 59, and the same may be true in transmission networks based on pathogen susceptibility34. This suggests that the family Bovidae, particularly cattle, may be important for transmitting pathogens between swine and other species. Commingling of wild pigs with cattle, sheep and goats is common throughout North America where domestic and wild ruminants share pasture resources1, 60. Based on our analysis of wild pig occurrence data, greater than 50% of all U.S. cattle, sheep and goat co-occur in a county with wild pigs. Commingling of livestock, particularly cattle, with wildlife has been associated with the introduction of several pathogens into wildlife populations61, 62.",

Vector borne pathogens made up less than 23% of pathogens indicating that those pathogens with direct transmission or transmission via fomites may be more likely to cross between species. Yet, despite their low overall frequency, vector borne pathogens were among the highest centralities for viral pathogens. The high potential for cross species transmission and the potential for expanding vector populations due to climate change63 highlights the potential risk posed by these pathogens. Vector borne pathogens can be among the most difficult to control once established64 and often cause long term challenges for disease risk mitigation.",

Cross species transmission may be of particular concern in regions with increased commingling of at-risk cattle with wild pigs60 and in regions such as the state of Michigan or Riding Mountain National park in Canada where M. bovis is endemic in wildlife68. Broadly our network centrality findings were similar to an inventory of known livestock pathogens that found 77% infect multiple hosts69, a study of human pathogens that found 73% are zoonotic70, and a study of OIE domestic animal pathogens that found 79% can be transmitted between wildlife and domestic animals3.",

Interestingly for some pathogens, particularly avian influenza virus, there was a high transmission potential in the pathogen networks (see Table S4 in supplemental material) and a relatively low transmission potential for the primary host (poultry) in the host networks. There are several potential explanations for this apparent incongruity. Avian influenza viruses\u2019 natural host is wild waterfowl that were not included in our networks. This may indicate that other wildlife species such as waterfowl may have important connections across a diversity of hosts.

In North America, wild pigs have been documented as actively infected with and having contributed to the transmission of only a fraction of the pathogens we investigated and their contribution to the persistence of these pathogens is still largely uncharacterized9.

We found discordance between the available surveillance studies and the pathogens that can be shared across species. More than 50% of pathogens that cause clinical disease in other species did not have any North American studies of prevalence in wild pigs. This contrasts with the potential exposure of livestock to wild pigs; domestic animals such as cattle and sheep, that are largely pasture raised in North America, have a potential for coming into contact (directly or indirectly) with wild pigs74, 75 and share nearly 90% (see Table 4) of swine pathogens causing clinical infection. Those studies that do report prevalence are generally limited to local or regional investigations76, 77. While providing important data, local studies may not represent regional or national prevalence. We found only a few studies20, 78 that report prevalence and epidemiological patterns of infection at national or near national scales. Pathogens that did have multiple studies in different regions (e.g. leptospirosis, pseudorabies virus, swine brucellosis, and bovine tuberculosis) had prevalence estimates that ranged from 0\u201387% indicating spatial heterogeneity in prevalence and transmission risks likely occur. This result may be complicated by true and false detection errors that few studies addressed when reporting findings79 and can have large effects on estimated disease prevalence in wildlife80. Comprehensive surveillance systems that integrate livestock, wildlife, and human components have been previously identified as a need81. Explicitly accounting for the transmission potential and historic geospatial distribution of pathogens to prioritize surveillance (both livestock and wildlife) may offer benefits and reduce knowledge gaps for pathogens of concern for human, wildlife, and livestock health82. Developing a comprehensive national monitoring system that integrates domestic and wild animal surveillance, prioritizes pathogens based on transmission risk, potential consequences, and knowledge of occurrence could yield economic benefits for livestock health by reducing spillover events through early detection and risk mitigation83, 84.",

            "text": "Further, the expansion of wild pigs has resulted in a large portion of agriculture production and human populations occurring in regions where wild pigs are present (Fig. 4). For the livestock commodities we investigated all had large proportions of farms in regions with wild pigs and none had declines in co-occurrence with wild pig populations. This large proportion of overlap of agricultural and rural populations is increasing as wild pig populations expand in North America98. Pathogen exposure risk to both agriculture and humans, along with the potential economic impacts99, highlight the need for quantitative analysis and consequence assessments of the risks wild pigs pose to agriculture and human health3. Recent analysis by Tompkins, et al.100 found that disease emergence at the wildlife-livestock interface is often driven by human-induced activities and exposure to domestic animals. Further, Jones, et al.2 estimated that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence/reemergence will be closely linked to changes in the agricultural-wildlife nexus. Several studies2, 3, 100 have also found that available research and tools inadequately addresses these complex problems limiting prediction, prevention, and mitigation. Given the findings of these studies together with ours, it would be broadly useful to develop approaches for the wildlife-livestock interface that link risk assessments and economic consequence assessments allowing evaluation of the relative benefits and costs of surveillance and risk mitigation, not only for invasive wild pigs, but for a diversity of wildlife-agricultural disease conflicts.",

They also highlight heterogeneity in both species and pathogens indicating some species are more important and that some pathogens maybe more frequently transmitted. Additional work is needed to establish the risk of exposure and transmission for pathogens of concern to humans and livestock and may necessitate surveillance studies elucidating potential risks for pathogens of greatest transmission potential. While a complete picture of the risks of wild pig associated diseases is not currently possible, the risk assessment process is valuable for prioritizing knowledge gaps. Evaluation of potential, but unstudied, impact of wild pigs on the consequences of disease (e.g. outbreak duration, extent, effectiveness of disease management) maybe warranted. As the first comprehensive assessment of cross-species diseases associated with wild pigs, these results are an early step to characterize and prioritize the disease risks as wild pig populations expand.",
