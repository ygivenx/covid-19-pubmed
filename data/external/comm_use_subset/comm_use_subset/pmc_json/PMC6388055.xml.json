            "text": "The liver is the second largest organ of the human body, known for complex functional anatomy involving vascular and biliary relationships, which play fundamental roles in maintenance and regulation of the body energy metabolism.1, 2 Hence, disrupted function of the liver has been found to be related to an extensive range of complex diseases and metabolic disorders.3, 4, 5 Hepatomegaly (liver enlargement) is a major symptom indicating malfunctioning of the liver, either due to topical disease or in response to related diseases. It is known that common diseases associated with liver enlargement may be either due to hepatocyte fatty infiltration and hepatocyte enlargement (alcoholic hepatitis and other causes of fatty liver), or to infiltration of cancer cell deposits, which are growing rapidly (metastatic cancer, lymphoma, hepatoma). Other cases of congestive hepatomegaly could be due to hepatic venous outflow obstruction (congestive heart failure).6, 7, 8, 9 Liver weight is known to be correlated with body growth, internal organ weight, metabolic trait, age and sex, which are assumed to be controlled by polygenic effects.10, 11, 12 Previous studies of body growth and its composition, for purposes of either medical knowledge on growth or meat\u2010producing industries, affirmed and significantly contributed to the understanding of the complex genetic components underlying those age\u2010related traits (ie, selection experiments, quantitative trait loci [QTL] mapping, genome\u2010wide association studies [GWAS]).13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 However, the complex genetic background controlling growth in the context of liver weight is still obscure and requires the use of advanced animal models that may enable narrowing the mapped QTL intervals.",

            "text": "Rodent and human physiology are very similar, and various mouse models have been used widely in the study of liver anatomy and function in healthy and diseased forms, noting that animal models known so far in the study of human liver diseases manage to mimic specific features of the human disease but not all.20, 21 Given the wide genetic variation existing between human populations alongside the multiple limitations in human study (eg, weak control for standardized investigations), studying a complex human trait or disease requires a highly genetically diverse mouse population rather than a single mouse model. For this purpose, the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population model was designed to provide a new model population dedicated to genetic analysis of complex traits as needed for understanding complex human diseases.22, 23 This unique reference genetic resource comprises a set of approximately 350 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) created from full reciprocal matings of eight divergent strains of mice: A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ, NZO/HiLtJ, CAST/Ei, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ. Aiming to create a unique and inexhaustible resource of RILs presenting a large phenotypic and genetic diversity, a controlled randomization was carried out during the breeding process to disband large linkage disequilibrium blocks and to recombine the natural genetic variation of the inbred strains.24 The genetic contribution of the three wild\u2010derived founders of the CC lines (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ) is of great importance, representing the subspecies Mus musuclus castaneus (M. m. castaneus), M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus, respectively, which established a large number of sequence variants not segregating among classical strains.25 Indeed, simulation studies showed that the 100 RILs being developed at our laboratory enables mapping of a QTL explaining a total of 5% of the RIL phenotypic variation with an average genomic interval of 3.5 cM.26 All CC lines were genotyped using three different arrays. The Mouse Diversity Array (MDA) consisting of 620 000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers;27 thereafter, all SNPs with heterozygous or missing genotypes in the eight CC founders were filtered out leaving 170 935 SNPs, which were mapped onto to build 37 of the mouse genomes. The 170 935 SNPs were clustered (groups of n = 20 SNPs) based on their descent probability distribution, using HAPPY Hidden Markov Model (HMM) software28, 29 resulting in reduced intervals (8533), minimizing the effect of genotyping error and the analyses (faster). After the MDA, CC lines were re\u2010genotyped at an advanced generation with a new 7500 custom\u2010design SNP array, Mouse Universal Genotype Array (MUGA), providing the genome architecture of the CC lines30. Eventually, after five advanced generations, all CC lines were genotyped with Mega\u2010MUGA, and the genotypes of the three SNP arrays were merged (merge analysis) to prepare a single genotype file, which is now used successfully in QTL mapping.31, 32, 33, 34, 35\n",

A gene browser search within the LWL1 genomic interval revealed 155 features, from which 28 features are protein coding genes and 11 overlapping QTL. Focusing on the suggested protein coding genes, we observed a cluster of the mouse carboxylesterase 1 (Ces1) family, consisting of eight genes, Ces1a\u2010Ces1h (MGI: 3648919, 3779470, 95420, 2148202, 95432, 2142687, 88378 and 1922954, respectively) comprising the hepatic carboxylesterase family proteins playing major roles in lipid metabolism and xenobiotic clearance.13, 53 Increased attention to the carboxylesterase family is due to potential roles as cholesterylester and/or triacylglyceride hydrolases; so far, Ces1d has been identified as a triglyceride hydrolase54 which is regulated by inflammatory factors (interleukin\u20106, transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1).55 A recent study of the role of Ces1d in hepatic liver metabolism shows that Ces1d deficiency in mice ameliorates the hepatic steatosis, suggesting possible potential in non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) therapy.56 The co\u2010location of the Ces1 family cluster within the LWL1 QTL for liver size suggests sharing common expression regulators, responding to liver growth also at the level of metabolic function to address the body metabolic demands. Another organized gene cluster with high relevance to growth and development57, 58 was observed within the LWL1 QTL, the Iroquois homeobox genes complex B (IrxB), consisting of the three genes Irx3, Irx5 and Irx6 (MGI: 1197522, 1859086 and 1927642, respectively). The presence of the IrxB cluster induces the complexity of the LWL1 region due to their multiple regulatory roles in early development. Adjacent to the IrxB cluster, within the significant LWL1 QTL, we located the fat mass and obesity\u2010associated (FTO) gene and Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein 1\u2010like (Rpgrip1l) gene, together identified as a topologically associated domain (TAD) structure in which any transcriptional perturbation during development may potentially affect bodyweight index.59 The Rpgrip1l gene (MGI: 1920563) is highly involved in growth/early development and suggested to be a tumor suppressor of hepatocellular carcinoma.60\n",

Several studies revealed FTO gene association with NAFLD, colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer to be further examined.65 Another candidate gene located within the LWL1 interval, named the Retinoblastoma\u2010like 2 gene (Rbl2; MGI: 105085), member of the Retinoblastoma (Rb)/Rb\u2010like protein family, plays an important role in cell differentiation and early development, and therefore suggested to be involved in growth interruption and tumors.66, 67 The Rb gene family has been reported to be involved in regulatory pathways with organ size control mechanisms of the body, inactivation of the Rb pathway using Rb family knockout mouse model, resulting in development of liver tumors, implying its strong regulatory role in control of cell proliferation.68, 69 One more candidate gene, matrix metallopeptidase 2 (Mmp2; MGI: 97009), belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. Mmp2 plays an essential role in tissue growth at the regulatory level of angiogenesis, proteolytic remodeling processes of the extracellular matrix and adipogenesis during growth.70\nMmp2 null mutation mice show a development delay and reduced body size compared with wild types, as well as fat malformation at the adipose tissue suggesting an important role in adipogenesis.71, 72 Additionally, the Calpain, small subunit 2 Capns2 gene (MGI: 1916793), member of the Calpin system, plays a crucial role in regulation of angiogenesis, development and cancer, reported to be in association with various physiological and pathological processes (eg, type 2 diabetes, cancers, cataract, muscle dystrophy).73\n",

Furthermore, 24 QTL underlying liver weight were mapped and located at multiple genomic location of different chromosomes emphasizing the genetic complexity of the liver weight phenotypic trait, to be controlled by multiple loci genome wide. Up to this report, the known QTL mapped for liver weight were located at chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, X and a suggestive QTL on chromosome 8 for liver weight (see Table S1).14, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 Certainly, the accumulated data of QTL mapping has expanded the knowledge on genetic architectures controlling liver weight; however, the accurate genetic components are still obscure due to wide genomic intervals (ranging 24.7\u2010105.8 Mb) leading to a serious impediment for selection of genes of high candidacy. As expected, using the CC mouse population in the current study allowed mapping a significant QTL with exceptional high resolution of 4.77 Mb, thus narrowing the possibilities of candidate genes, bringing us closer to the actual candidate genes controlling liver weight. Indeed, the search for candidate genes within the LWL1 significant interval revealed very interesting genes and gene complexes that are known to be associated with body growth and size whether independently or interacting with other genes. Suggested candidate genes of the current study included the FTO gene, which is known to be associated with obesity (growth control) and thereafter with tumorigenesis (interrupted growth control), as well as the Ces1a to Ces1h family, which is related to lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis, additional to further genes involved in cell proliferation and growth such as Capns2, Mmp2 and Rbl2.
