The high sensitivity of molecular techniques raises questions about the clinical relevance of positive test results. The presence of a virus does not necessarily indicate causation of clinical symptoms or disease [3]. On the contrary, bacterial co-infection is usually associated with a more severe diseases course and worse prognosis, despite the precise interaction between bacteria and viruses is not always clear.",

Supplemental oxygen and / or mechanical ventilation requirement during admission were also recorded. Bacterial superinfection diagnosis was established according to the referring physician criteria, based on clinical data, inflammatory markers, and radiological findings, and/or appropriate cultures in sterile sites (e.g blood or cerebrospinal fluid).

We performed all the analysis using the R Software, Version 3.0.2 (www.r-project.org). General data were presented as means with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Different statistical models were used to assess the bivariate association between the variables depending on the dependent variable. The relationship between demographic and clinical variables with mono-infection and co-infection was analysed using simple logistic regression. A binary logistic model was used for the binary variables (co-infection status, oxygen requirements, respiratory support needed and PICU admission), linear model for continuous variables (Wood-Downes Score and GENVIP Score), negative binomial regression model for counted data (hospital stay length) and logistic multinomial model for the multinomial variable (respiratory distress status). Multiple regression models were considered using the significant risk factors obtained in the bivariate analysis and sex and age variables. In order to reduce the likelihood of false significant results due to too many statistical comparisons, the Bonferroni multiple test correction were considered. A \u03c72 test was performed to evaluate the correlation between bacterial superinfection and pneumococcal vaccine. Level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.",

A shorter hospital stay has been reported in children with rhinovirus bronchiolitis than with RSV [20]. Rhinovirus and RSV co-infection is reported to increase the risk of severe disease [8] or the bronchiolitis relapse [21, 22]. Other studies did not find significant differences in severity between co-infection and single infection [12, 18, 23, 24]. In our study we did not find increased severity of illness in children with RSV-rhinovirus dual infection. In our series, only RSV as mono-infection increased oxygen requirements, and rhinovirus as a co-infecting pathogen increased the Wood-Downes score in the Spanish cohort, but these isolated findings arising from the multivariate analysis could not be replicated in the UK cohort.",

Studies of the pandemic influenza indicate that respiratory viruses predispose to bacterial complication and interaction between viruses and bacteria in respiratory infections has been extensively reported in the literature [29], but the underlying mechanisms between viral and bacterial synergism are complex and remain unclear [30]. Common respiratory viral infections, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus have been linked to seasonal increases in Streptococcus pneumoniae disease [31]. The relationship between bacterial and viral infection is clouded by the low sensitivity of bacterial detection in sterile-site samples by traditional culture methods, and the reliance on non-specific clinical data for the for diagnosis of bacterial co-infection, including inflammatory markers, radiological findings and / or appropriate cultures, resulting in 30% of the cases in the GENDRES cohort and 55% in the UK cohort. Bacterial superinfection increased most measures of severity in both cohorts (PICU admission, respiratory support requirement, GENVIP score, hospital stay length and respiratory distress).",

Pneumococcal vaccine reduced the severity of viral LT-ARIs through a reduction in oxygen requirement, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, admission to PICU, respiratory distress, and GENVIP score. A reduced incidence of viral alveolar pneumonia has been previously reported after pneumococcal vaccination [31, 32], although there was no demonstrable reduction in the number of confirmed pneumococcal infections. This is likely to reflect the limited sensitivity of culture-proven pneumococcal disease in pneumonia. The protective effect of pneumococcal vaccines found in our study might reinforce the importance of the paradigm of viral-penumococci interaction at nasopharynx level in the pathogenesis and clinical course of the disease [33] Current pneumococcal conjugate vaccines significantly decrease nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci [34] and thus reduces the possibility of this viral-pneumococci direct interaction.",
