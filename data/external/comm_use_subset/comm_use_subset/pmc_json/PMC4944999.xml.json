The envelope bilayer harbors the two spike glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and the M2 proton channel. The homotrimeric HA is the most abundant protein on the viral surface. It mediates attachment to the host cell surface via binding to sialic acid (SA) residues of cellular receptors, and upon endocytic virus uptake it triggers fusion of the envelope with the endosomal membrane releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm. NA cleaves glycosidic bonds with terminal SA facilitating the release of budding virions from the cell.",

HA-binding peptides have been recently obtained by phage display, lead structure optimization of natural products and specific toxins, bioinformatics tools and discovery from side effects of known anti-inflammatory peptides [16\u201323]. Some of them showed antiviral activity [17, 19\u201323]. A more epitope-oriented accession to binding peptides is the search for paratope-derived peptides from variable regions of specific antibodies [24]. Antibodies against HA have been described, and at least 6 antigenic sites (A-F) on the HA-trimer have been identified, localized either at the receptor binding site, the interface of the three HA-monomers, or at other sites like the stalk [8, 11, 25]. Several structures of HA\u2013antibody complexes have been published deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) [11\u201314]. Indeed, an antibody was described, whose HA binding is mediated mainly by one CDR, namely HCDR3 [12].",

Virus isolates were clarified upon low speed centrifugation (300 x g, 10 min) and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (100 000 x g, 1 h). For safety reasons, viruses prepared for SPR experiments were inactivated by 5 min irradiation with UV-light on ice. Infectivity of inactivated virus was precluded using MDCK II based cell-assays, remaining binding ability of HA was proven using standard hemagglutination assay (HA) with human red blood cells [29]. For SPR measurements, also monovalent split vaccine influenza strains A/NewYork/55/2004 H3N2, NIH accession No. ABO37541 (New York H3N2), A/Victoria/210/2009 H3N2, NIH accession No. AFM71802 (Victoria H3N2) and the split vaccine Pandemrix (GlaxoSmithKline) of influenza strain A/California/7/2009 H1N1, NIH accession No. ACP44189 (California H1N1) were used. Protein concentrations were determined using standard BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Additionally viruses were titrated for HA units. Here, 50 \u03bcl virus concentrate was serially diluted twofold in PBS using 96-well microtiter plates. Then, 50 \u03bcl of 1% human red blood cells (German Red Cross, Berlin, AB+) were added to each well, followed by an incubation of 60 min at room temperature. The last well showing hemagglutination provided the HA units per 50 \u03bcl virus solution. For the Rostock H7N1 strain turkey erythrocytes have been used. Additional material used was HA from Aichi H3N2 (Sino Biological, 11707-V08H).",

In the SPR based screen for virus binding, single and double mutated variants of PeB-Lys were used. All lysine variants were purchased from Biosyntan or Genecust with >95% purity.

For the biological assays PeB, PeBGF and the control peptide ARDFYDPDVFYYAMD-amide (PeBP) were applied.

Stock solutions of PeB, PeBGF and PeBP were prepared by initial dissolving in DMSO, followed by dilution in PBS (8 mM peptide with 10% DMSO v/v). Solvation was improved by sonication.

Contribution to the total binding free energy change of every amino acid of PeBGF binding to HA of Aichi H3N2 obtained by MD-simulations is shown in Fig 2B. D6G and Y11F mutations decreased the contribution of free energy changes of these residues (S4 Fig and Discussion). Y11F alters only moderately its interaction with HA, but it induces a favorable contribution change in the interaction of its neighbor residue phenylalanine 10 with HA. The side chain of residue 11 is oriented towards the solvent in PeB, due to its polar property. On the other hand, the absence of a -OH group in the residue side chain in PeBGF induces a slight change in the orientation of the loop, tilting now the phenylalanine side chain towards a hydrophobic region of the HA \u03b1-helix, located between residues 160\u2013163.",

In this screen, we identified PeBGF as the best binder. The two substitutions, D6G and Y11F, altered the ligand moiety and its binding contacts, resulting in favorable changes to the contribution to the free energy change of residues 6, 8 and 10 (Fig 2B). The mutation of residue 6 (D6G), replacing a charged amino acid by a neutral one, resulted in two major changes. Firstly, it induces a decrease of its own electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy, but such a change is largely overcome by an increase in the contribution to the polar solvation free energy change (S3 Fig). On the other hand, one should notice that residues 6 and 8 are located in close contact to each other in the loop region. As a consequence for PeB, this involves repulsive interaction between two negatively charged residues (D6 and D8). The replacement of D6 by an uncharged residue in PeBGF probably induces a slight reorganization in the loop structure, favoring van der Waals and polar solvation interaction contributions between this residue and the HA moieties (S3 Fig).",

Notably, there is enrichment of aromatic amino acids Tyr and Phe, and of Asp. In line with these findings, a recently published human antibody against H1 shows a higher proportion of aromatic amino acids in the HCDR3 domain, too [50]. The crucial role of an Asp residue and hydrophobic amino acids in the HA binding of many receptor mimicking antibodies is highlighted by Lee et al [13].",

As summarized in Table 2, PeB and PeBGF provides better inhibition against Aichi H3N2 compared to Rostock H7N1, with the exception of the results from the HAI assay. However, we should take into consideration that the performance of a peptide as inhibitor depends on many factors. As a consequence, the hemagglutination inhibition efficiency may not necessarily be stronger against Aichi H3N2, even though the peptide was derived from an antibody binding to this influenza strain. One can speculate that Rostock H7N1 is more prone to neutralization by blocking this binding site, while for Aichi H3N2 PeB and PeBGF can be displaced more easily in a binding competition experiment with erythrocytes. This trend could also be explained by the use of erythrocytes derived from different species (see Material and Methods). Similar strain-dependent efficiencies have been obtained by L\u00f3pez-Martinez et al. [22]. Although a peptide was designed against broadly conserved epitopes, the antiviral efficiency was not the same against all tested serotypes (three different H1N1 strains and H5N2).",

For example, sialyl-containing oligosaccharides constituting the natural receptors of hemagglutinin on mammalian epithelial cells, exhibit a millimolar 1:1 affinity, but due to multivalent virus-cell attachment the binding is strong enough to enable infection. Effective inhibition of influenza virus infection by multivalent sialic-acid-functionalized gold nanoparticles and other glycoarchitectures has been described [57, 58]. More recently, a trivalent glycopeptide mimetic containing three sialyl residues matching the three sialyl binding sites in a HA trimer, was reported to bind to H5 hemagglutinin 4000 fold better than the monomer [59]. Recently, we demonstrated that the antiviral effectivity of acylated PeBGF can be increased, upon presentation in a multivalent fashion by 10-fold against Rostock H7N1 and by 20-fold against Aichi H3N2 [60]. Further, multivalent presentation of the short s2 peptide (ARLPR) with a dendrimer resulted in sub-micromolar inhibitory activities [61].",
