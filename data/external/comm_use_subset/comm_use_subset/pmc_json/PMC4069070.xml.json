In the past, the number of parasite antigens available for vaccine studies has been quite limited. Presently, advances in the establishment of Plasmodium genomes and proteomes [17]\u2013[19] together with high throughout laboratory techniques [20], can potentially accelerate the development of malaria vaccines. Additionally, the use of bioinformatics tools to explore the malaria genome/proteome databases has allowed new approaches for identification of parasite proteins containing \u03b1-helical coiled coil domains [21].",

A P. vivax Salvador I genome database (PlasmoDB) was used for the selection of P. vivax orthologous to P. falciparum protein sequences from asexual blood stages containing \u03b1-helical coiled coil structures, analyzed by COILS software [27]. Fifty P. vivax orthologues were found to have at least 30% homology with the 170 P. falciparum \u03b1-helical coiled-coil proteins previously identified. Sequences were of the maximal length possible in order to maximize the stability of the \u03b1-helical conformations and to increase the array of conformational epitopes that could be yielded. Selected \u03b1-helical coiled coil-containing proteins were further characterized as to possible surface location and GPI anchoring, using the following software: identification of potential signal peptides by SecretomeP and SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/) [28]; transmembrane spanning region- (TMPRED http://www.ch.embnet.org/ software/TMPRED_rm.html and TMHMM http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM; [29], and GPI-anchored proteins (http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/sat/gpi/gpi_server.html\n[30]; and prediction of sub-cellular localization (pTARGET) [31].

Most of the fragments were antigenic with variable prevalence depending on the origin of the serum samples. Variation in reactivity among sera appeared to be associated mainly with the distinct malaria transmission conditions in these two regions [42], [43]. Whereas PNG is highly endemic for P. vivax and accounts for a large proportion of the malaria cases, Colombia is a low- to moderate malaria-endemic region where P. vivax is the prevalent Plasmodium parasite. However, other factors such as differences in the genetic background of the host and parasites, and transmission rate may also explain the differences observed in the recognition frequency. These results are similar to those found in previous studies where different reactivity was observed when antigens were tested with sera from different endemic areas [26], [44].",

On the other hand, affinity purified human antibodies specifics to two P. falciparum antigens were reactive with the P. vivax parasite antigens. All eight preselected antigens induced antibody responses although to a variable degree regarding antibody titers and antibody kinetics. Similar results were obtained in previous studies using P. falciparum orthologous antigens, which elicited variable intermediate-to- high antibody responses [26]. Responses do not seem to be associated with fragment length since strong antibody titers were observed in response to smaller fragments such as PvPep43. However, only four peptides (PvPep43, PvPep45, PvPep82.02, and PvPep96.03) induced antibodies in mice that were able to react with whole P. vivax parasites; these four peptides induced the strongest antibody responses.
