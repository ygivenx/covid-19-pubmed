            "text": "Secondary goat anti-mouse IgG Ab did not show background interactions with antigen-derived peptides. As shown in Fig. 1a,c, MAb 5D-8.1 gave defined spots for the VP1 sequence of CV-B1, CV-B4, E-30, and reduced reactivity with CV-A1. The peptide scan indicated IPALTAVETGHT as the consensus sequence containing the epitope of MAb 5D-8.1. Comparable signals were produced by MAb 9D5 (Fig. 1b,d) and attributed to the consensus motif SIGNAYSMFYDG. Thus, relative to the VP1 sequence of CV-B4 (GI: 61031)29, the sequence containing the epitope of 5D-8.1 was close to the N-terminus at AA residues 28\u201339, whereas that of 5D9 was located towards the C-terminus at residues 187\u2013198. Substitution scan of peptide IPALTAVETGHT against MAb 5D-8.1 allowed to delimit the antibody binding site to a conserved core motif 4-IPALTAAET-12. AA positions 4I, 7L and 8T showed the highest degree of sequence conservation with a nearly complete loss in binding of MAb 5D-8.1 upon exchange by other amino acids. AA positions 5P and 11E were well-conserved, exchange by Q and by H, respectively, caused a 60\u201380% loss in antibody binding. Compared to this, AA positions 6A and 10A exhibited a slightly higher susceptibility for substitution by selected amino acids with a maximal decrease of 50% of spot intensities. 9A and 12T showed the highest tolerance for exchange by other amino acids. Replacement by F (9A) and A (12T) was accepted without loss in antibody binding.",

The resolved structures of six reference enterovirus strains were obtained from the RCSB database and a 1.4 \u00c5 sphere probe was used to represent a water molecule. The exposed surface area was first calculated, and then normalized with the maximum allowed solvent-accessible area30. Normalized SASA values take the form of Relative Solvent Accessibility (RSA), a quantity which varies between 0 (for completely buried residues) and 100 (for maximally exposed residues). Results are summarized in Fig. 2. The alignment of the VP1 regions recognized by the two MAbs is shown in Fig. 3a. The target residues are mainly accessible in the monomeric form for the two epitopes (N-terminal 5D-8.1, yellow; C- terminal 9D5, green). The exposed residues are highly conserved among different EV types, evidencing their importance in the capsid assembly process. Localization of the VP1 protein within the capsomere (Fig. 3b) shows that the 5D-8.1 epitope is located in a domain where exposed residues are stabilized by a beta sheet structure. Figure 3c shows the two epitopes in the VP1 protein assembled into the capsid.",

Interestingly, MAb 5D-8.1 produced significant alignments for creatine kinase U-type and a mitochondrial ATP synthase, among other proteins. These targets may represent the antigens indicated as cross-reactive by Korsgren and collaborators in 201327. Similarly, MAb 9D5 may be expected to bind to a variety of human proteins, including the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 66. However, much better alignments (i.e., much lower E values) have been obtained for enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and agents of the Rabovirus and Sapelovirus genera that represent the most recent members of the Picornaviridae family3132.",

To this end, a variety of methods can be used, but it is recommended that rather than relying on a single antibody, researchers should have the possibility of using pairs of antibodies designed to bind different parts of the same target protein. The case of MAb 5D-8.1 is remarkable in the context of diabetes research. In fact, numerous immunohistochemical studies with 5D-8.1 documented the presence of EV VP1 within the islets of Langerhans in a large proportion of T1D cases, but not in the pancreas of non-diabetic subjects28. These studies suggested that viral infection played a pathogenic role in T1D. In 2013, it was shown that MAb 5D-8.1 could bind human islet proteins, specifically the mitochondrial proteins creatine kinase B-type and ATP synthase beta subunit27. The finding triggered a reassessment of EV infection of pancreatic islets in T1D cases34. Two subsequent publications settled the issue in part, convening that - under appropriate staining conditions - MAb 5D-8.1 was an adequate probe for EV infection2528.",

Binding results and bioinformatics analyses confirmed that the epitopes of 5D-8.1 and 9D5 are distinct and located at the N- and C-terminal domains of VP1. Both antibodies are directed to conserved domains of a capsid protein of picornaviruses, and recognize the majority of EV types. However, they are not neutralizing, as expected for antibodies targeting conserved regions of the viral shell. Our data delineate the spectrum of EV types that each antibody binds to, thus confirming partial published results on the specificity of the two MAbs18202426. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the two antibodies cover EV types of the A species less well than those of the B, C, D species (Table 2). Since the binding spectra are not identical, the combined use of MAbs 5D-8.1 and 9D5 should allow to cover almost all EV types. Notably, both antibodies are also predicted to cover Rabovirus and Sapeloviruses, animal viruses of the most recent genera within the Picornaviridae family. Immunofluorescence results confirmed that MAb 5D-8.1 (but not 9D5) may produce fine granular fluorescence in the cytoplasm of uninfected human and monkey cells. This, however, occurred only at elevated antibody concentrations (i.e., >1 \u03bcg/ml). The observation is in line with the lack of absolute specificity of EVs reported by Korsgren and collaborators27. We could however confirm that, when adequately diluted, the antibody produces specific staining of different EV types in cultured cells25 without fluorescent signals in uninfected cells. Of interest to diabetes research, the linear epitopes of both MAbs bear only marginal similarity with the human proteome, with a few possible exceptions. In particular, the 5D-8.1 epitope bears similarity with creatine kinase U-type (E value, 3.0), ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor (E value, 12), creatine kinase B-type (E value, 66).",

Elongated sequences were linked to a single artificial sequence. The elongated artificial sequence was translated into 15 AA peptides with a peptide-peptide overlap of 14 amino acids and bound to duplicate spots of silica microarrays. The resulting microarrays covered peptides of all four sequences (1,181 different peptides in duplicate). For control, microarrays were framed by HA (YPYDVPDYAG) and FLAG (DYKDDDDKGG) peptides (104 spots). Rockland blocking buffer MB-070 (VWR International Frankfurt, DE), PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, PBS-Tween plus 10% Rockland blocking buffer were used for blocking, washing, and incubation procedures, respectively.
