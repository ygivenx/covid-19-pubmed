            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are the most common infectious diseases among children. The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in Europe is 33/100,000 in the age group < 5 years [1]. Its clinical manifestation includes symptoms ranging from mild rhinitis to severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. The risk group of severe disease course includes children < 5 years of age, especially boys, individuals in immunosuppression, and patients suffering from chronic diseases [2]. Establishing the etiological factor is a difficult task. There are no clinical, radiological, or biochemical markers that would enable the differentiation between bacterial and viral infections [3]. This frequently results in the overuse of antibiotics in the therapy of acute respiratory infections. British, American, and Polish guidelines state that, in children hospitalized due to pneumonia, microbiological examinations should include blood cultures, the detection of the presence of viruses with the use of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) or immunofluorescence in material collected from the nasopharynx (smear or upper respiratory aspirate), the assessment of antibodies against Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila in classes IgM and IgG, and the comparison of antibody levels in the acute phase of the disease and during convalescence [4\u20136].",

Nasal smear cultures are not useful in establishing the etiology of pneumonia. The pathogens grown in a such manner include both physiological flora as well as flora that could potentially cause pneumonia. On the other hand, microbiological cultures need to be secured before antibiotic therapy is commenced, which is impossible in many cases. The solution to this problem is the detection of microbial genetic material in, for example, the material acquired from nasal smear cultures.",

            "text": "It is, however, important to remember that PCR results may be positive in the case of persistent infections; in some pathogens prolonged shedding is observed even up to 7 months since the beginning of an infection [7]. Another problem is that traditional bacterial cultures are insufficient to establish the etiology, mainly due to the significant participation of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of these infections. This especially concerns children in their first year of life, in whom viral infections may be responsible for even 67% of pneumonia cases [8]. The currently used molecular examinations enable quick identification of numerous pathogens. Detecting the influenza virus with PCR is a widely accepted and utilized method of confirming infection [9]. This is also true for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The main drawback of tests detecting just a single pathogen is the necessity of requesting every examination separately, collecting samples for analysis multiple times, and making decisions concerning the selection of pathogens for analysis. Test panels used for establishing the presence of the most important bacterial and viral pathogens enable simultaneous detection of the most significant etiological factors. A separate problem is that, apart from the accepted viral etiology, pneumonia may also be caused by new viruses, such as the human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus, or bocavirus [10]. Molecular techniques are more sensitive and capable of diagnosing more viruses [11]. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is important for infection control and surveillance, patient cohorting, treatment choices, and avoiding antibiotics. Previous experience with the use of the multiplex real-time PCR tests in the population of children is limited [11\u201314].",

Probable etiology of pneumonia was diagnosed in 76% of children with the use of this method. After the exclusion of children with neoplastic diseases from the group, this percentage increased to 79.54%. Similar percentages of positive results are often encountered in the literature [8, 12, 14]. Bierbaum et al. achieved positive results of multiplex real-time PCR tests detecting only viral factors in 76% of cases in a group of children below the age of six with symptoms of respiratory tract infection and the dominant pathogen was RSV [12]. In a study conducted by Mengelle et al. on a group of 914 children with symptoms of respiratory infection, 90% of the collected samples were positive, with RH, RSV, and IF (influenza virus) as the most frequent pathogens [15]. In our analysis, we found a more significant participation of RSV; however, only patients with pneumonia underwent the analysis. The general lower participation of the viral factor in comparison to the research by Mengelle most likely results from the fact that our study included a number of bacterial factors that the above-mentioned work did not take into consideration. In a Swiss study conducted by Cevey-Macherel et al. in 2009, the etiology of 85% of pneumonia cases was diagnosed in children below the age of five with the use of the PCR method; in 67% the results pointed to the presence of viruses and in 52% bacteria, and in 33% of the children the etiology was mixed [16]. In an Italian study within a group aged 5\u201314 years, etiology was established in 77% of cases with the use of molecular analysis. The presence of viruses was revealed in 65% of samples and bacteria in 40% of samples, while mixed etiology was present in 28% of children [17]. Mengelle et al. demonstrated that infections caused by more than one virus are common and occurred in 30% of the children included in his study.",

            "text": "The sensitivity of virus detection of the multiplex real-time PCR method is high and reaches almost 90% [11]. When genetic material of several pathogens is revealed with the use of the PCR method, it may result from a simultaneous infection caused by two pathogens or from an infection in a patient who is already a carrier of another pathogen. It may also result from establishing the presence of viral genetic material after a previous infection, through the so-called virus shedding. It is estimated that the etiology of pneumonia is mixed in about 30% of children [18]. Some works point out that there is a relation between the type of viral factor and the risk of coinfection. Martic et al. found coinfections with different pathogens in 50% of infections caused by adenovirus [19]. The high percentage of coinfections in our study may be explained by the specificity of the study group. The majority of the children were burdened with the presence of chronic diseases, and some of these patients were in immunosuppression. The presence of bacterial coinfection is frequent in viral etiology of pneumonia; however, bacteria are not always responsible for active infections. In children with pneumonia, establishing the presence of viruses in the upper respiratory tract is considered as a probable etiological factor. Positive results may also be achieved in individuals in temporary asymptomatic carrier state during convalescence after a previous infection [13]. It is, therefore, necessary to remain very cautious when interpreting examination results. The clinical significance of human RV RNA detection in respiratory samples remains unclear [20]. The PCR method does not enable unambiguous differentiation between infection and carriage, even with the use of the quantitative method. It needs to be stated, however, that comparative studies of carriage significantly more often indicated the presence of S. pneumoniae in children with pneumonia compared to the healthy population [21]. The available literature contains reports stating that higher numbers of viruses were usually associated with milder disease course [20]. The exception was the coinfections with RSV and hMPV [22]. Infections of this type are characterized by intensified obstruction symptoms [22]. In our group, the children with infections caused by mixed pathogens did not differ from the children with infections caused by single pathogens, in terms of both the severity of disease course and intensity of inflammatory reaction.",

The literature indicates that viruses may be responsible for the majority of pneumonia cases in children [8, 16]. In our group, in the case of hospitalized children, some patients received outpatient antibiotic therapy, which was then continued during inpatient care in all cases. Therefore, all samples were collected during antibiotic therapy, on the fifth day on average. Hence, it is not possible to completely exclude the presence of bacterial factors, which were not identified in the upper respiratory tract later on due to the ongoing antibiotic therapy. This may explain the relatively low percentage of bacterial genetic material detected in the group we analyzed. The current guidelines recommend the use of antibiotic therapy in children hospitalized due to pneumonia, but the lack of clinical improvement despite the application of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy may suggest a viral cause of infection [4\u20136].",

Such patients are at a higher risk of severe course of infection and prolonged hospitalization. The diagnosis of a viral etiology of infection enables moderate use of antibiotics and allows for more emphasis on symptomatic treatment, which is the most beneficial for such patients. Because viruses are easily transmitted from patient to patient, advanced infection control methods are critical in controlling the spread of viruses [20]. RSV turned out to be the most frequently detected pathogen, especially in the group of children under the age of one. Moreover, it was frequently the only identified pathogen. In children from risk groups, RSV causes infections with severe course, and it is characterized by high infectiousness. Diagnosing RSV as the etiological factor enables the isolation of or cohorting the patients in order to reduce the spread of the infection and the implementation of the recommended management for severe obstruction [4, 5]. Research is currently being conducted on the implementation of antiviral drugs which are more effective than the previously used ribavirine [23\u201325]. In the case of viral infections such as influenza, the establishment of the etiological factor enables the implementation of specific treatment. In the studied group, a single case of influenza was found, but the year in which the study was conducted was not an epidemic year. Molecular tests for detecting the influenza virus only are widely applied. They are very useful during epidemic seasons, but it is important to remember that the disease may occur also outside such periods. In certain situations, it may be difficult to select a diagnostic test only on the basis of symptoms. Moreover, in the case of influenza, the time of treatment implementation is crucial. Therefore, including influenza in the standard diagnostic set prevents the omission of this important infection factor.",
