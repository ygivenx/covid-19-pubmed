Two main genetic lineages A and B have been identified to date. The phylogenetic studies showed a high similarity to the respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), with which it shares morphological and disease spectrum similarities [3]. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections from common colds to pneumonia have been attributed to HMPV, with bronchiolitis being one of the main clinical signs of primary infection in hospitalized patients [4]. A recent meta-analysis has provided evidence that HMPV has an important etiological role in acute lower respiratory infections in children less than five years [5].",

All other episodes of acute expiratory wheezing were considered to be recurrent wheezing [7]. Asthma was diagnosed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines [8]. Laryngotracheobronchitis was associated with inspiratory dyspnea and wheezing. Laryngitis was related to inspiratory dyspnea without wheezing. Cases with both focal infiltrates and consolidation in chest X-rays were, in the absence of wheezing, classified as pneumonia.",

Nevertheless, in Jordan, Schuster et al [13] found up to 53% of coinfections, and rhinovirus and adenovirus were frequently detected in coinfections, as in our country, but they also encountered a substantial number of coinfections with HRSV, being clearly higher than in Spain. This has also been described in other studies, such as Semple [18] in the United Kingdom, where coinfections between HMPV and HRSV were frequent and severe. However, in California [19], as in our study, only 1% of patients had coinfections between HMPV and HRSV. Probably, the seasonal circulation of HMPV is different among countries or geographical areas and allows that mixed infections were more or less frequent. Hence, in Jordan, HMPV was detected in winter and spring, and they were partly coincident with the circulation of HRSV. However, in Spain, circulation of both viruses was significantly different making coinfections unlikely. February, March, and April were the peak months of HMPV circulation in our country.",
