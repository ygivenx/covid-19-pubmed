Since 1976, there have been 885,343 suspected and laboratory confirmed cases of EVD, including 1711 cased on the ongoing disease outbreak has claimed 932 lives in West Africa [1]. This part of the world is persistently confronted with this fatal disease which has an incubation period of two to 21 days (averagely 3-13days). Symptoms range from, firstly, fever and fatigue before descending into headaches, vomiting, violent diarrhoea, then multiple organ failure and massive internal bleeding [1,2]. Ebola typically begins in remote places and can be distributed via hospitals/healthcare centers or within the community as it takes several infections before the disease is ascertained. The prevalence, morbidity and case fatality of chronological EVD outbreaks showed the persistent resurgence in different regions in Sub-Saharan Africa (see Figure 1).",

Overall, Ebola virus socio-ecology systems have shown to be linked by direct and indirect transmission through contact with objects from patients. For example, the blood or secretions of an infected person or objects that have been contaminated with infected secretions can reach humans from a variety of hosts/sources: na\u00efve infected populations, infected wildlife, fruit and vegetable bats and the handling of infected fruit bats, monkeys, chimpanzees, gorillas, forest antelopes and porcupines are all possible natural hosts (whether ill or dead or found in the jungle or rainforest) [1,2]. Thus, tracking, mapping, reporting and documenting veterinary public health zoonosis surveillance responses, the behaviour and medical history of butchers and poachers, as well as agro-livestock business trading are imperative to be able to establish integrated community-based and national comprehensive early warning and outbreak surveillance response systems.",

Hence, active early warnings approach under the framework of a surveillance response system both for veterinary and human public health should be established and implemented. This system could include, for example, a ban on bush meat consumption, a ban on public places and markets, a reinforcement of safety and inspection regulations on food and fruit eating bats and examining bat migration as well as other animal-household drivers and risk factors [3,4].",

Building a local network (e.g. WhatsApp) or crowdsourcing data for targeted active responses, as well as the implementation of a geographical information system (GIS), are necessary spatial-temporal mapping and decision-making support systems to contain Ebola outbreaks. Lessons learnt from other outbreaks including cholera, H7N9 and H1N1 avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Lassa fever, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), dengue pandemic and the human-animal with environmental-climate interface in Africa and elsewhere can assist in setting benchmarks for monitoring epicentre/focal early warning alert, incidence and prevalence as well as effective surveillance response interventions measures [1,5]. Meanwhile, modelling factors and trends in different changing transmission scenarios could also yield better tactics, as well as strategic evidence not only for policy support, but also for direction, planning and implementation of national and regional early alert and surveillance response systems to control and prevent sentinel sites [4]. Following from the aforementioned three challenges and requirements to respond to EVD outbreaks in Africa, the following actions are recommended to combat EVD as well as other emerging infectious diseases.",

The genus Ebolavirus is one of three members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus), along with the genus Marburgvirus and the genus Cuevavirus, and comprises five distinct species, of which Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus are mostly associated with the major EVD outbreaks in Africa. Reston ebolavirus and Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus are mostly reported in the Asia-Pacific region, especially Philippines and the People\u2019s Republic of China, but no symptoms or deaths in humans from these have been reported to date [2]. The disease outbreak has persisted over the years across Central, East and Southern Africa. On March 21, 2014, the first case of an outbreak was identified in Guinea, West Africa, witnessing a total of 460 cases with 339 fatalities, as it spread beyond the remote rural areas to the capital city of Conakry. Soon after the outbreak was identified, it appeared across the border in the small nation of Liberia on March 30, 2014. This country was the least hit with 339 cases and 156 fatalities thus far. Later, it was also identified in Sierra Leone in late May 2014, just as it appeared the outbreaks in Guinea and Liberia were winding down. It has since spread to at least two Sierra Leone districts with 533 cases claiming at least 233 lives, including 68 deaths of 85 new cases within just four days. Similarly, between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths were reported during the same period and one death in Nigeria [1] (see Table 1).",

Experiences and lessons learnt from outbreaks in developed nations could be shared with limited-resource countries so that they can to establish early warning and surveillance response systems [4]. Irrefutably, national and regional inter-sectorial and trans-disciplinary approaches must be adopted and related to ministries and organisations in order to build innovative early warning system surveillance response systems through fostering capacity building and training on outbreaks and emerging infectious disease prevention, control and elimination. It is also imperative to understand global health involvement and governance, establish monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of research for action programmes, as well as increase funding to support efforts of existing and new consortiums and research projects in Africa. Furthermore, there is need to analyse the socio-economic and cultural factors, the status of prevailing health systems, and the risk factors and determinants of the emergence and spread of outbreaks in Africa. Reliable and well-organised monitoring, the establishment of GISs and appraisals of cost-effectiveness in an integrated national health system (with a care management approach) will eventually improve evidence information for policy-makers [4]. In turn, they can make decisions and guide implementers of health programmes to achieve beneficial and innovative sustainable global public health interventions, quality healthcare outcomes and economic prosperity.",
