In Taiwan, where 4.2 per 100,000 persons die annually from the disease based on the 2012 report from the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan [3] leukemia is the 13th leading cause of cancer-associated death. Acute leukemia are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells that can be divided into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which can occur at all ages and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) which most often occurs in children and adolescents, with approximately 60% of patients being younger than 20 years [4,5,6]. It was reported that about 50% of the young adult patients and approximately 90% of older patients with AML or ALL die from those diseases [5,6]. Currently, the cure-rate for patients with AML remains at approximately 25% [7], mainly due to the side effects which still are the major limit to treatment success. Thus, finding new compounds derived from natural products for leukemia is needed.",

Apoptosis, a programmed cell death, can be divided into extrinsically and intrinsically mediated pathways. Both pathways involve the activation of caspases (cysteine proteases) for inducing cell apoptosis [8,9]. The extrinsically-activated pathway involves the activation of cell surface ligand-gate death receptors such as Fas and Fas-L and triggering of the pro-caspase-8 to form active-caspase-8 followed by activation of caspase-3 to induce apoptosis [10,11]. The intrinsically-activated pathway, also called the mitochondria-mediated pathway, through mitochondrial dysfunction, leads to cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm and induction of apoptosome formation with Apaf-1 and the activation of caspases for inducing apoptosis [12,13,14]. Furthermore, pro-apoptotic protein Bax, the ratio of Bak and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl also play an important role affecting the mitochondrial dysfunction involved in the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway [15,16].",

            "text": "Currently, about 47.1% of approved anticancer drugs are unmodified natural products, their semisynthetic derivatives, or molecules synthesized based on natural products [17]. Glycyrrhetic acid (GA), a component of the plant Glycyrrhiza uralensis, exhibits in vivo biological activities such as hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and anticancer functions [18,19,20]. The mechanisms of GA\u2019s anticancer activities have been known to involve reduced cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and the inhibition of cellular metastasis [19,21,22]. 18\u03b1-Glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03b1-GA), a hydrolyzed metabolite of glycyrrhizin, had been shown to display anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anticancer activities [18,23,24,25]. It was reported that 18\u03b1-GA inhibits the proliferation of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and induces apoptosis and increases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) expression and decreases NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity [26]. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GE) (a hydrolysis product of glycyrrhizic acid) had been shown to prevent or to induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (a phenomenon related to oxidative stress) in rat heart mitochondria depending on its concentration [27]. Recently, it was reported that 18\u03b1-GA inhibited gingival fibroblast growth by suppressing the G1/S phase transition and inducing apoptosis [28]. However, there is no available information to show the effects of 18\u03b1-GA on human leukemia cells, thus, the aim of present study was to investigate the in vitro toxic effects of 18\u03b1-GA on human leukemia HL-60 cells. The results showed that 18\u03b1-GA treatment of HL-60 cells resulted in apoptotic cell death through mediation by extrinsically and intrinsically mediated pathways.",

The results indicated a brighter fluorescence of HL-60 cells after 48 h treatment of 18\u03b1-GA at 40\u2013120 \u03bcM (Figure 2A) and this bright fluorescence represents nicked DNA and nuclear chromatin condensation. The results also indicated a comet tail for HL-60 cells after 48 h treatment of 18\u03b1-GA at 40\u2013120 \u03bcM (Figure 2B) and the longer comet tail represents DNA damage. Both effects are dose-dependent manner. Cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM of 18\u03b1-GA for 48 h and DNA was isolated for gel electrophoresis with results shown in Figure 2C, where 18\u03b1-GA at 100 \u03bcM clearly induced a typical ladder pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation (DNA fragmentation). DNA fragmentation is a hallmark of cell apoptosis, thus this finding suggests that 18\u03b1-GA induces apoptosis of HL-60 cells.",

            "text": "Numerous reports have shown that some clinical anticancer drugs could be obtained from natural products, thus, finding novel anticancer agents from natural plants has been recognized as one of the best strategies for the development of chemotherapeutic agents. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GE) can occupy mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors [29] with a measurable affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors in mononuclear leukocytes [30]. Furthermore, GE can block 11-\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, thus reducing the availability of cortisol at the adipocyte level [31]. Although several reports have demonstrated that 18\u03b1-GA induced cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells, there is no available information to show if 18\u03b1-GA induces cytotoxic effects on human leukemia HL-60 cells. In the present study, we examined the in vitro cytotoxicity of 18\u03b1-GA on HL-60 cells. Firstly, the anti-proliferation effects of 18\u03b1-GA on HL-60 cells were investigated and MTT assay results indicated that 18\u03b1-GA inhibited cell proliferation with an IC50 of 100 \u03bcM (Figure 1). Next, we examined 18\u03b1-GA-induced nuclear condensation, DNA damage and fragmentation and we found that 18\u03b1-GA induced nuclear condensation (Figure 2A), DNA damage (Figure 2B) and fragmentation (Figure 2C) that are the hallmarks of cell apoptosis, which means that 18\u03b1-GA induces cell apoptosis in HL-60 cells in vitro. Thirdly, we investigated 18\u03b1-GA induced cell apoptosis and whether or not it occurred through mitochondrial dysfunction and involved caspase activities and the results indicated that 18\u03b1-GA decreased the levels of \u0394\u03a8m (Figure 3A), and increased the activities of caspas-8, -9 and -3 (Figure 3B\u2013D). Fourth, we investigated possible protein expression associated with cell apoptosis, thus, western blotting was used to examine the protein expression and the results indicated that 18\u03b1-GA increased caspase-8, -9 and -3 (Figure 4A) and cleaved-form-PARP (Figure 4B), increased pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, t-Bid and decreased anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Figure 4C) and induced Fas, Fas-L and cytochrome c (Figure 4D), and increased AIF and Endo G (Figure 4E). Fifth, we further investigated whether 18\u03b1-GA induced cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria, which was assayed by confocal laser microscopy and results indicated that 18\u03b1-GA increased the releases of cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (Figure 5A,B).",

In order to investigate how 18\u03b1-GA reduced total viability and whether this went through the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells, we used a DNA gel electrophoresis assay which indicated that 18\u03b1-GA induced cell apoptosis based on the development of DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder) that is a characteristic of cell apoptosis and this finding also is in agreement with other reports which indicated that 18\u03b1-GA induced cell apoptosis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [26].",

Furthermore, Ca2+ accumulation can impair mitochondrial function and lead to increased release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [34]. We used a flow cytometry assay and found that 18\u03b1-GA decreased the levels of \u0394\u03a8m in HL-60 cells (Figure 3A) and these effects are time-dependent. This pathway is named the intrinsic signaling pathway. It was reported that the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 is involved in the levels of \u0394\u03a8m, so if this agent caused decreased levels of \u0394\u03a8m in mitochondria which can cause cytochrome c and/or AIF release, it could lead to cell apoptosis [35,36]. Thus, we examined associated protein expression and we found that 18\u03b1-GA increased the pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and t-Bid (Figure 4B) and decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl (Figure 4C) and also increased cytochrome c and AIF (Figure 4E) in HL-60 cells. This finding is in agreement with reports which indicated that 18\u03b1-GA decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in human gingival fibroblasts [28]. Based on those findings, we suggest that 18\u03b1-GA induces apoptosis of HL-60 cells through a mitochondria-dependent pathway. We also used confocal laser microscopy to examine the release of apoptotic proteins from the mitochondria and the results indicated that 18\u03b1-GA increased cytochrome c (Figure 5A) and AIF (Figure 5B) release from mitochondria to the cytoplasm.",

We used flow cytometry to assay the activities in HL-60 cells after exposure to 100 \u03bcM of 18\u03b1-GA and we found that 18\u03b1-GA increased the activities of caspase-8, -9 and -3 (Figure 3B\u2013D), which was also confirmed by western blotting (Figure 4A) which indicated that 18\u03b1-GA increased the active forms of caspase-8, -9 and -3 in HL-60 cells. It is well documented that cell apoptosis may go through the extrinsic death receptor pathway and/or the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway [38,39]. In the extrinsic pathway, Fas and Fas-L activate pro-caspase-8 and then activate downstream executioner caspases, including caspase-3, causing apoptosis or they also cleave Bid into truncated Bid this leads to mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cytochrome c release and induced caspase-9 and -3 activation to induce apoptosis, which is called the intrinsic pathway [12]. Those pathways also can be called caspases-dependent pathways. Furthermore, it is also well documented that agent-induced cell apoptosis may go through the decrease of the levels of \u0394\u03a8m and subsequent release of AIF and Endo G from the mitochondria into nuclei to induce apoptosis. It was reported that mTOR inhibitors have been used to treat several advanced cancers [40], thus, further investigations are needed regarding whether or not 18\u03b1-GA induced cancer cell apoptosis involves AKT/mTOR pathways.",
