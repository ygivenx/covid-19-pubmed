SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread and led to an outbreak in China and then became a global health emergency. Although control measures and isolations have been applied for prevention, the infection has increased and caused a pandemic (2). Although this virus belongs to a relatively well-known viral family, Coronaviridae, and is similar to viruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had an outbreak in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which had an outbreak in 2012, in some characteristics, there are a lot of uncertainties and unknown specifications about this virus such as its origin and source of infection, its emergence, and its mechanism of action and transmission (3, 4).

This is the third contagious Coronavirus leading to an epidemic in the 21st century after MERS and SARS (17). The key problems surrounding this novel virus are as follows: diagnosis, mode of transmission, long incubation period (3 to 14 days), predicting the number of infected cases in the community, and insufficient protection resources due to its pandemic specification (15, 18). The accurate transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, since various factors impact its transmission. Moreover, infection of family clusters and healthcare workers indicate the human to human transmission of the disease and its contagiousness, which makes the condition more complicated (19, 20). ",

We also found that smokers are more susceptible to Coronavirus infections, especially to the most recent species. Various reasons may justify this happening. It has been mentioned that smokers have unregulated ACE2 in remodeled cell types, which is consistent with results of SARS studies. However, factors such as amount of smoking, the duration of smoking, and the duration of smoking cessation also play a role. In some previous studies on MERS-CoV-2 it has been shown that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), which is the specific receptor for this virus, had a higher rate of expression in smokers and COPD patients (24).
