Among the respiratory viruses, influenza is one of the most important pathogens due to their seasonality and continued pandemic threat [2]. This negative-sense-RNA orthomixovirus enters the cells by binding to sialic acid residues, followed by endocytosis and fusion of viral envelope with endocytic membrane. Viral ribonucleoproteins (RNP), composed of RNA polymerase complex, viral RNA, nucleoprotein (NP) and nuclear export proteins (NEP), are released and transported to the cell nucleus where transcription and replication of the viral genome takes place. Next, viral RNPs are transported from the nucleus to the host cell plasma membrane, where the final steps of virus assembly and virion budding occur. The active influenza replication cycle is carried out in the human epithelial surface of the respiratory tract, which represents the largest interface for gas exchange, and plays a key role in fluid and ion transport [3] as well as surfactant production [4].",

Macrophages are susceptible to influenza infection and viral proteins are made, but no infectious virus progeny is made [9]. Thus, influenza-infected macrophages are endowed with a janus-face: they orchestrate the host immune response [10], but may release cytokine in an atypical fashion \u2013 leading to influenza-induced cytokine storm [11]. Polarization to one of these conditions could be highly influenced by the presence of different stimuli in the respiratory tract, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which could activate toll-like receptors (TLR) [8], [12], [13].",

HIV-1 infection provokes a progressive loss of CD4+ T cells through virus-, cellular- and immune activation-dependent mechanisms [15], eventually collapsing the immune system. HIV-1 imposes a new homeostatic equilibrium for its human host [15], [16], as it replicates in different anatomical compartments, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes and lungs, establishing numerous virus sanctuaries [17], [18]. HIV-1 surface glycoprotein gp120 and other viral products may even affect cells not susceptible to HIV-1 infection, as they have promiscuous binding to numerous cell-surface molecules \u2013 triggering different events, such as cell death [19]. Whereas the HIV-1-host cell interactions and tissue abnormalities at the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are well known [17], [20], the fate of HIV-1 infection and replication in the respiratory tract remains poorly understood [21], [22].",

For instance, Barchi et al found that the clinical outcome in HIV-1-infected individuals with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was not different from that in immunocompetent patients [25], and Ormsby et al reported that only HIV-1-infected subjects that had progressed to the immune deficiency typical of AIDS presented an increased mortality by A(H1N1)pdm09 [29]. Therefore, it is plausible to hypothesize that during HIV-1/influenza co-infection a new homeostatic balance must be imposed on the host. For example, components of the innate immunity have proved to significantly contribute to the effective control of viral infections, such as interferon-induced cellular restriction factors (e.g. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3; IFITM3) that may target both HIV-1 and influenza A [31]\u2013[35]. In this study, we show that influenza replication is attenuated during HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infection experimental assays, as HIV-1 viral particle or its viral surface glycoprotein gp120 reduce A(H1N1)pdm09 replication in an IFITM3-dependent fashion. Consistent with HIV-1-induced decreased influenza replication, A(H1N1)pdm09 evolution was delayed in the presence of HIV-1, both in in vitro experiments and in individuals co-infected with both viruses, a phenomenon that may correlate with mild influenza outcomes during clinical episodes of co-infection. Thus, we report here, for the first time, that HIV-1 interferes with the A(H1N1)pdm09 replicative cycle, arresting the influenza evolution and attenuating the viral replication. Our results may contribute to explain the mild influenza infection observed in patients co-infected by HIV-1 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.",

            "text": "Influenza replicates in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract [47]. Influenza-infected tissues release \u03b2-chemokines, such as CCL5 (Rantes), which is chemotactic for blood monocytes [7]. Monocytes migrate to the respiratory tract where they differentiate into macrophages and may participate during the host immune response to influenza infection [7]. In HIV-1-infected individuals, macrophages sustain viral replication even in the presence of antiretroviral therapy [21], [22]. Because HIV-1 and influenza infect macrophages and epithelial cells in the respiratory tract [15], [47], respectively, it is thus plausible that influenza-infected cells are exposed to HIV-1-derived products and/or viral particles at the same anatomical site. To evaluate whether HIV-1 could change influenza replication, we exposed A(H1N1)pdm09-infected HeLa cells to HIV-1 or to its surface glycoprotein gp120. An approximately 40% and 25% decrease in the quantification of A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed when influenza-infected cells were exposed to HIV-1 or to gp120, respectively (Figure 1A). Infectivity of influenza virus produced in the presence of HIV-1 and its gp120 was also reduced by approximately 2-log10 (Figure 1B). Of note, other HIV-1 proteins, which could be secreted from HIV-1-infected cells, such as Tat, did not affect influenza replication significantly (Figure S2A and B). Moreover, the HIV-1 effects towards influenza replication were dependent on the retroviral input (Figure S3). Inhibition of influenza replication was not due to exposure of HeLa cells to different agents, because cells exposed HIV-1 or gp120 remained with over 95% of viability (Figure S4). Our results therefore suggest that HIV-1 or its products presented in extracellular milieu may weaken influenza replication. As expected, there was no HIV-1 replication in HeLa cells (Figure S5). Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), a known inhibitor of influenza replication [48], was used as a positive control to inhibit A(H1N1)pdm09 replication (Figure 1).",

It has been demonstrated that IFNs inhibit influenza replication in cell culture and in laboratory animals by the restriction factor IFITM3 [49]. Since we showed above that Influenza production is diminished upon exposure of A(H1N1)pdm09-infected cells to IFN-\u03b3, HIV-1 or HIV-1 gp120 (Figure 1), we next evaluated whether the HIV-1-induced inhibition of influenza replication would be dependent on TLR 2 and/or 4. Influenza-infected HeLa cells were exposed to HIV-1 in the presence of blocking antibodies to TLR 2 or 4. As we can see in Figure 2, both antibodies prevented HIV-1's ability to inhibit influenza replication. Of note, control isotype antibody had no influence on HIV-1-dependent impact over influenza replication.",

HIV-1-infected macrophages (with 10 days of infection) were exposed to A(H1N1)pdm09 (MOI  = 5) for 3 days, and the amount and infectivity of influenza recovered from the supernatants were monitored. We found that A(H1N1)pdm09 RNA levels (Figure 6A) and infectivity in MDCKs (Figure 6B) were decreased by 40% and 90%, respectively, in the supernatant of HIV-1-infected macrophages. These results were consistently reproduced in macrophages from eight different healthy donors. Although macrophages are the only human cell type that could be infect by both HIV-1 and influenza virus simultaneously, absence of A(H1N1)pdm09 productive infection in these cells may limit further mechanistic analyses. Nevertheless, because influenza virus has shown a diminished infectivity in the presence of HIV-1, our findings seem to be consistent with the mild clinical outcomes of HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected individuals [5], [25], [26], [29], [53].",

The HIV-1 infection augmented by three times the macrophage IFITM3 levels (as detected 14 days after infection), relative to IFITM3 contents in uninfected cells (Fig. 7A). Of note, we tried to perform siRNA assays to knockdown IFITM3 in macrophages; however, knockdown efficiency varied severely from donor to donor, precluding further mechanistic analyzes based on this strategy. Nevertheless, as it has been shown that IFITM3 restricts influenza life cycle by preventing arrival of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to the host cell nucleus [54], we measured the levels of A(H1N1pdm)09 bound to plasma membrane and the amount of viral RNPs that reached the nucleus of HIV-1-infected macrophages at early and late time points, by synchronizing influenza infection and measuring influenza RNA levels in the macrophage nuclear and non-nuclear fractions (see Material and Methods for details). Consistently with the mechanism of action of IFITM3, A(H1N1)pdm09 penetration into the nucleus was reduced by 80%, in HIV-1-infected macrophages (Figure 7B; pellet fraction from the early lysis). No significant changes in A(H1N1)pdm09 adsorption was observed in HIV-1-infected macrophages (Figure 7B; supernatant fraction from the early lysis). At a later time point (24h after A(H1N1)pdm09 addition to HIV-1-infected macrophages), increased levels of influenza RNA was detected in the non-nuclear cell fraction (Figure 7B; supernatant from the late lysis), concomitant with the low amount of influenza RNA found in the nuclear fraction (Figure 7B; pellet from the late lysis). The increment in influenza levels in the non-nuclear fraction was consistent with the diminishment of this virus infectivity in the presence of HIV-1, as measured by titration in MDCKs (Figure 6). It is reasonable to imagine that in the presence of HIV-1, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus particles would enter into the macrophages, but their way to the nucleus would be impaired, limiting later steps of influenza life cycle.",

Influenza infection in macrophages in the absence and presence of HIV-1 is shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. With respect to macrophages infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 only, NP localizes superficially in most of the cells, while some already display this protein in their nuclei, at 1 h after infection (Figure 8A). Subsequently, NP nuclear distribution progressively increases at 3 and 6 h after infection (Figure 8B and C). At late time points, nuclear localization of NP is more intense (Figure 8D). With respect to influenza co-infection in HIV-1-infected macrophages, no NP signals are found within the nuclei at early time points (Figure 9A to C). At 24 h after influenza infection, NP is observed in the nuclei of HIV-1-infected macrophages (Figure 9D), but also diffused throughout the cytoplasm \u2013 differently than what has been observed in macrophages infected only with influenza (Figure 8D).

As we can see (Figure 11), the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09's ability to enhance the TNF-\u03b1 levels is reduced in HIV-1-infected macrophages.

We chose for sequencing this gene, because it has the highest evolution rate amongst influenza genes. As experimental infection assays were performed in quadruplicate and produced similar HA sequences, representative consensus are displayed in the phylogenetic tree and compared with parental strains (Figure 12A). The analysis of the translated nucleotide sequences reveals that evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was slower in the presence of HIV-1, gp120 or IFN-\u03b3 than that observed for virus cultured in the presence of medium only (Figure 12A), highlighting that HIV-1-induced inhibition of A(H1N1)pdm09 replication resulted in an impaired influenza evolution. Of note, the differences in virus evolution among the experimental groups are very small, since the presence of cell-culture-derived changes, P199Q and Q240R in comparison to the parental viruses (A/California/07/2009, vaccinal strain, and A/Minas Gerais/490/2009, primary isolate), forced the sequences to cluster together.",

As we can see in Figure 12B, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus from co-infected individuals (Figure 12B, circles) are phylogenetically closer to vaccinal strain/index case of 2009 pandemics, A/California/07/2009, than to most of other samples from the same period and region. Evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from HIV-1-infected individuals seems to have being impaired when compared to other samples from similar geographical region and time period (Figure 12B). Consequently, no specific pattern of mutations existed to cluster A(H1N1)pdm09 sequences from HIV-1 co-infected individuals together (Figure 12B, circles), with the exception of a small cluster from influenza sequences of southern Brazil (Figure 12B, see influenza strains A/Rio Grande do Sul/5470/2009, A/Rio Grande do Sul/5661/2009 and A/Santa Catarina/14529/2009). Regarding specific mutations, when HA sequences from co-infected individuals were compared with others from mild to fatal cases (81 specimens), it is possible to observe that Brazilian strains have the changes P100S, I338V and Q310R, while the mentioned three strains from southern Brazil have only Q310R and S220T changes. The reduced influenza evolution in the presence of HIV-1 may reflect a compromised A(H1N1)pdm09 replication and may correlate with mild clinical outcomes for co-infected individuals living in different regions of the world [25].",

Surprisingly, HIV-1-infected individuals presented a benign clinical outcome when infected by A(H1N1)pdm09 [25]\u2013[30], unless when in AIDS [29]. Although some empirical explanations have been raised to clarify this phenomenon, such as anti-A(H1N1)pdm09 activity of antiretroviral drugs or enhanced medical attention paid to these patients, the possibility that the concomitant infection with HIV-1 may attenuate the replication of Influenza virus and, thus, mitigate the infection clinical course has not been systematically evaluated. Since it has been reported that HIV-1 infection may lead the host to a new homeostatic equilibrium and confer resistance to some co-pathogens [16], we evaluated in this study whether HIV-1 infection could interfere in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 life cycle. This study represents a challenging approach, because these agents primarily infect different cell types. Nevertheless, relevant insights made here may contribute to understand better the outcome of the clinical episodes of HIV-1/influenza co-infection.",

Here, we also showed both viruses were found in respiratory secretions from co-infected hosts. Considering that influenza is a seasonal virus, it may infect HIV-1-postive patients many times throughout the life-span of these individuals. Therefore, HIV-1 replication may be influenced and also influence influenza life cycle. HIV-1 replicates in alveolar macrophages [21], [22], and the respiratory tract may constitute a viral sanctuary, since antiretroviral resistance mutations may be found in the sputum of individuals with undetectable, HAART-suppressed, viremia [21], [22]. Besides, influenza infection triggers a pulmonary inflammatory response with subsequent homing of monocytes to the respiratory tract [5], [57], thus increasing the number of HIV-1 permissive cells. In HIV-1/influenza co-infected individuals, some of these CD4+ cells homing to the respiratory tract due to influenza infection may also harbor latent proviral HIV-1 genome in their nucleus; thus, upon activation they may actively produce the mentioned retrovirus \u2013 which could potentially increase HIV-1 viral loads in the respiratory tract. A(H1N1)pdm09 active replication in the respiratory tract occurs in epithelial cells, and also in macrophages [57]. Despite that, influenza-infected macrophages progeny is uninfectious, as shown here and elsewhere [51].",

Therefore, influenza-infected cells may be continuously exposed to HIV-1 viral particles and to HIV-1 surface protein gp120 in the respiratory tract of HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected patients. Thus, we reasoned that evaluating the impact on influenza replication resulting from A(H1N1)pdm9-infected epithelial cells exposed to HIV-1 or gp120 could constitute a valuable model to get insights on the relatively benign clinical evolution of influenza infection in HIV-1-infected patients. Here, we found that HIV-1 and gp120 produced a TLR2/4-dependent IFN-like effect towards influenza replication, revealed by the IFITM3-dependent HIV-1- or gp120-induced inhibition of influenza replication. The IFITM3 effect on influenza life cycle could toll influenza replication, decreasing viral evolution and, perhaps, contributing to the mild clinical symptoms observed in our groups of HIV-1/A(H1N1)pdm09 co-infected individuals.",

Macrophages function as natural reservoirs of HIV-1 and sustain long lasting virus replication [15], whereas this cell is non-permissive for influenza [51]. That is, infectious influenza virus enters into macrophages, viral proteins are synthetized, but no infectious progeny are made [58]. Initially, macrophage susceptibility to influenza may allow this cell to act like a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d, by allowing antigen presentation via class I MHC and, therefore, orchestration of an cell-mediated cytotoxic antiviral response [10]. On the other hand, hospitalization due to influenza infection occurs due to symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), which are associated with an enhanced pro-inflammatory response by influenza-infected macrophages [11], [59]\u2013[62]. Indeed, we observed that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus titer dropped over time in inoculated human primary macrophages, supporting the notion that no infectious virus progeny is generated. After inoculation of HIV-1-infected macrophages with A(H1N1)pdm09, the infectivity of influenza virus recovered from culture supernatants is significantly smaller than in supernatants from macrophages not infected by HIV-1. We also found that HIV-1 enhances IFITM3 content in macrophages. As it has been proposed, IFITM3 inhibits influenza replication by impairing the arrival of viral RNPs into the nucleus [56]. In fact, we showed that in HIV-1-infected macrophages, A(H1N1)pdm09 RNA translocation into the nucleus was reduced/delayed and, consequently, influenza transcription in HIV-1-infected macrophages is attenuated. This phenomena may have reduced influenza-ability to induce TNF-\u03b1, which is one of the most important cytokines released during influenza-induced cytokine storm [51], [63]. Therefore, we imagined that chances of cytokine storm in HIV-1/influenza co-infected individuals would also be reduced, which could have contributed to the surprise mild clinical outcomes observed for this group of risk during the 2009 pandemics.",
