As its first step in infection IAV attaches to host cells by the binding of its major surface protein, the hemagglutinin (HA), to sialic acids, which are omnipresent on the glycolipids and glycoproteins exposed on the surfaces of cells. Where the structural requirements for this interaction have been studied in great detail, much less is known about whether and how the attachment to specific sialylated receptors (e.g. to N-linked glycoproteins, O-linked glycoproteins or gangliosides or even to specific receptors within these groups) affects the subsequent endocytic steps. Obviously, knowledge about the repertoire of endocytic pathways that can successfully be used by IAV will increase our insights into cell and species tropism of IAV. In turn, this will contribute to our understanding of the requirements for the generation of novel viruses with pandemic potential that can arise by exchange of RNA segments between currently circulating human serotypes and an animal virus during occasional co-infection in a human or an animal host.",

Their occurrence, abundance and mechanistic details appear to vary between cell types, tissues and species and their utilization by viruses as a route of entry makes them an important factor in host and cell-type permissiveness for infection [11], [12]. Besides by CME, different viruses have been shown to enter cells via caveolae, macropinocytosis or other, less well described, routes [11], [12]. Most often, the selection of a specific endocytic route is linked to the utilization of a specific receptor that facilitates traveling via that particular route. Nevertheless, many receptors allow flexibility by their capacity to enter through multiple pathways. For IAV, an additional level of complexity to the dissection of potential entry routes is added by the apparent lack of an IAV-specific protein receptor.",

            "text": "A full experimental characterization of the IAV entry pathways will benefit from separation of the IAV entry pathways into routes that can be studied independently. Whereas co-localization with clathrin is an established marker for endocytosis via this route, the complete lack of unique markers for macropinosomes or most other endocytic compartments [13], [14] complicates such studies. Furthermore, crucial to any study concerning endocytic pathways is the abundantly documented fact that such pathways are highly dependent on experimental cell culture conditions [15]\u2013[19]. Pathways that are constitutive in one cell type may be absent or inducible by specific experimental conditions in other cell types. Moreover, the manipulation of specific endocytic pathways may result in up or down regulation of other specific pathways. Here we have established entry assay conditions that allow dissecting cell entry of IAV into a dynamin-dependent (DYNA-DEP) and a dynamin-independent (DYNA-IND) component. Dynamin is a large GTPase forming multimeric assemblies around the neck of newly formed endocytic vesicles. GTP hydrolysis is required for pinching off of the vesicles [20]. Whereas CME is completely dependent on dynamin, several other endocytic routes do not require dynamin [21]. We performed an extensive characterization of the dynamin-independent IAV entry route using pharmacological inhibitors as well as by expressing dominant-negative mutants and applying siRNA induced gene silencing as tools. Taken together the results identify a pathway that closely resembles macropinocytosis as a novel entry pathway for IAV.",

The continuous presence of 10 nM BafA1 (added to the cells 1 hr prior to infection) for 16 hrs completely prevents infection. In contrast the addition of BafA1 at 1 hr or 2 hrs post infection resulted in high levels of luciferase activity (again measured at 16 hrs p.i.) that were 63% or 90% respectively of the control to which no BafA1 was added, indicating that entry was essentially completed within 2 hrs. The last bar of Fig. 1C shows that the inhibition by BafA1 is reversible as withdrawal of the inhibitor after 2 hrs resulted in high levels of infection. The specific effect of BafA1 on IAV entry was confirmed by confocal microscopy demonstrating that BafA1, as expected, traps IAV particles in a peri-nuclear location, presumably in non-acidified endosomes (Fig. 1D). BafA1 was subsequently exploited to establish a specific IAV entry assay (hereafter further referred to as the Gluc-entry assay). HeLa cells transfected with pHH-Gluc were inoculated with IAV at a range of MOIs and incubated for 2 hrs after which the entry medium was replaced by complete growth medium containing 10% FCS and 10 nM BafA1 to prevent any further entry of virus. Entry was indirectly quantified by determination of luciferase activity after further incubation for 14 hrs demonstrating a quantitative correlation between infection dose and luciferase activity across a wide range of MOIs (Fig. 1E). The indirect Gluc-entry assay was next tested for its capacity to examine the effects of inhibitors on IAV entry. Dynasore or BafA1 (Fig. 1F) were included in the medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS) during entry (the first 2 h of infection) and were removed when the inoculum was replaced by growth medium containing BafA1. Concentrations up to 80 \u00b5M dynasore did not inhibit entry which is in agreement with the result shown in Fig. 1B. In contrast, 1.25 nM BafA1 already inhibited entry for more than 60% (Fig. 1F). As a control, dynasore was also added at 2 hrs post infection to analyze whether the drug affected IAV replication during the post entry phase. As expected, 80 \u00b5M dynasore did not significantly inhibit IAV replication when present from 2 to 16 hrs p.i. (Fig. 1F). Thus, with the Gluc-entry assay we can study the effect of specific inhibitors on IAV entry in a quantitative manner, at least as long as the inhibitors do not irreversibly affect IAV replication during the post entry phase.",

Whereas dynasore completely inhibited entry in PBS, inclusion of 5% and 10% FCS resulted in increasing levels of dynasore resistant entry (Fig. 2A), suggesting the existence of a serum-inducible DYNA-IND IAV entry pathway. This effect was not caused by inactivation of dynasore during the experiment as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which enters cells by CME [24], [25], was still sensitive to 80 \u00b5M dynasore in the presence of 10% FCS (Fig. 2B). In agreement herewith, the uptake of transferin, known to occur via CME, was inhibited by dynasore regardless of the presence of FCS (Fig. S2, panel A). As expected, both DYNA-DEP entry in PBS and DYNA-IND entry in the presence of 10% FCS and 80 \u00b5M dynasore required sialic acid receptors for efficient entry as pre-treatment of HeLa cells with neuraminidases almost completely abolished entry via either pathway (Fig. 2C). The kinetics of the DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry pathways were compared by performing a time-course experiment in which IAV entry was terminated by the addition of 10 nM BafA1 at different time points (Fig. 2D). In comparison to entry via the DYNA-DEP pathway (the only pathway available in PBS) entry in the presence of FCS (when presumably both the DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry pathways are available) showed similar kinetics. In contrast, entry via the DYNA-IND pathway (which is the only pathway that is active in the presence of 10% FCS and 80 \u00b5M dynasore) was slower. The difference was most prominent after 15 min, while after 4 hrs similar levels of entry were reached.",

Serum-induced DYNA-IND entry was examined in 10% FCS using the Gluc-entry assay. 80 \u00b5M dynasore was added in order to block CME and any other potential DYNA-DEP entry pathways. This allowed the independent inhibitor profiling of the novel pathway by avoiding the potentially masking effect of the presence of redundant entry pathways. Cells were preincubated with the kinase inhibitors (10 \u00b5M) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then inoculated with virus (MOI 0.5) in the presence of 10% FCS and 80 \u00b5M dynasore for 2 h at 37\u00b0C (DYNA-IND entry). In parallel, inoculations were also done in PBS to compare the effects of the inhibitors on DYNA-DEP entry. After 2 hr the medium and inhibitor were replaced by full growth medium containing 10% FCS and 10 nM BafA1 to allow the subsequent expression of Gluc activity under identical conditions for the DYNA-IND and -dependent entry assay. Six kinase inhibitors appeared to act non-discriminatively, inhibiting both DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry (Fig. 5A): the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors Ro 31-8220, rottlerin (both displaying moderate cytotoxicity, result not shown) and hypericin, which have all three been previously identified as IAV inhibitors [28], [29]; the highly cytotoxic pan-specific serine/threonine protease inhibitor staurosporine; the irreversible PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor TYR9. In order to investigate whether some of these inhibitors affect IAV replication during the post-entry phase, we performed the same experiments but now adding the kinase inhibitors after viral entry. Four of the inhibitors thus appeared to induce significant inhibition of post-entry processes (Fig. 5A). Although unlikely, we cannot formally exclude that post-entry processes specific for only one of the two entry pathways are affected. Interestingly, whereas no specific DYNA-DEP entry inhibitors were identified, 15 inhibitors (none displaying cytotoxic effects, data not shown) caused significant (p<0.05) inhibition (>5-fold) of DYNA-IND entry (Fig. 5B). This included inhibitors of the calmodulin dependent kinases myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and CaMKII and seven inhibitors of different growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. In contrast to the three non-specific PKC inhibitors mentioned above, the PKC inhibitors BIM-1 and HBDDE appeared to have a specific inhibitory effect on DYNA-IND entry. The specific effect of these drugs on DYNA-IND entry is not only shown by the lack of inhibition of DYNA-DEP entry in PBS, but also by the observation that none of the fifteen compounds induced >2-fold inhibition when added post-entry (at t = 2 hr post infection). The kinase library screen was repeated on A549 human epithelial lung carcinoma cells in order to confirm the results in a potentially more natural host cell line. The inhibition profiles obtained were very similar to those found for HeLa cells with the exception of the strong effect of AG879 (99% inhibition) and moderate effects of AG825 (39% inhibition) and Tyr51 (68% inhibition) on DYNA-DEP entry.

Rab5 is a small GTPase found in association with several endosomal compartments and crucial for the function and maturation of early endosomes. It is required for the trafficking of a wide range of endocytic cargo following different routes, including DYNA-DEP as well as DYNA-IND routes [31]. Entry of IAV has been shown to require Rab5 [32]. Consistently, we found that HeLa cells expressing Rab5 DN (as identified by GFP fluorescence, Fig. 6C) were much less susceptible to productive IAV infection (as judged by indirect immunofluorescence using Alexa-488 labeled NP antibodies) than cells transfected with Rab5 wt, both by DYNA-DEP (64% inhibition) and by DYNA-IND (47% inhibition) routes (Fig. 6D). In contrast, when examining the efficiency of DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry routes in cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of MLCK (MLCK DN; examined in comparison to MLCK wt), only IAV infection under DYNA-IND conditions was significantly reduced (Fig. 6E; 53% inhibition). Similarly, a construct encoding the N-terminal head domain of myosin II MyoII-head) also only significantly affected DYNA-IND entry (Fig. 6F; 92% inhibition). The combined results indicate that a dynamic actomyosin network requiring the activation of myosin II by MLCK is necessary for efficient entry of IAV via a DYNA-IND pathway.",

Of these, macropinocytosis has been demonstrated to be stimulated by growth factors present in serum and to depend on actin dynamics [12]\u2013[14]. Yet, studies on macropinocytosis are hampered by a lack of specific inhibitors, cargo, membrane markers and characteristic morphology. Amiloride and the more potent derivative EIPA are inhibitors of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) as well as of several other Na+/H+ antiporters. EIPA has often been used as a hallmark inhibitor that specifically inhibits endocytosis via the macropinocytic pathway [14]. Whereas DYNA-DEP entry of IAV was not inhibited by EIPA (Fig. 7A), DYNA-IND entry was fully blocked EIPA (Fig. 7B). The existence of redundant entry pathways in the presence of 10% FCS is clearly demonstrated by the marginal inhibition by either EIPA or dynasore whereas the combination of EIPA and dynasore resulted in strong inhibition both in the Gluc-entry assay (Fig. 7C) and in the direct VLP entry assay (Fig. 7D and E). Supplementary Fig. S1 shows that other cell lines, including the human lung epithelial cell line A549, display similar IAV inhibition patterns for EIPA and dynasore. Consistently, virus production displayed a similar inhibitor sensitivity profile (Fig.7 F and G) as virus entry indicating that the entry pathways we characterized lead to a productive infection. Clearly, VLPs and viral particles follow similar redundant entry pathways, distinguishable in a DYNA-DEP and a DYNA-IND pathway, the latter being sensitive to EIPA and dependent on actomyosin function.",

Therefore, the uptake of soluble FITC labeled dextran (Fdx) into relatively large vesicles (0.3 to 5 \u00b5M) has often been applied as a morphological marker for macropinosomes. Using this marker we found that the addition of 10% FCS to the culture medium slightly increased the uptake of Fdx into HeLa cells (Fig. 8A). Notably, the distribution of Fdx changes in response to serum from a random distribution into a more granular pattern. At high magnification and at color settings adjusted to higher intensity it could be seen that these Fdx granules were free of actin staining (by phalloidin) indicating that they were in the lumen of vesicles (result not shown). Interestingly, in the presence of IAV (MOI of 10) the uptake of Fdx into vesicles was clearly enhanced. At a higher magnification viral particles could be found to co-localize in Fdx loaded vesicles as well as outside these vesicles (Fig. 8B). Phalloidin staining of actin was used to demonstrate that many virus particles localized to actin-rich protrusions at the periphery of the cell. The uptake of Fdx was studied in a quantitative manner by flow cytometry (Fig. 8 C). A moderate, but reproducible shift to higher Fdx fluorescence was observed at 37\u00b0C when virus was added in presence of 10% FCS whereas such a shift was absent when no serum or virus was added. This result confirms the observations by confocal microscopy (Fig. 8A) which showed that the combined presence of FCS and IAV increases the uptake of Fdx as compared to FCS alone. In a control experiment the uptake of Fdx in 10% FCS in presence of IAV was shown to be specifically inhibited by EIPA, but not by dynasore (Fig. S2, panel B). In contrast, transferrin uptake, which serves as a specific marker for CME, was affected by dynasore, but not by EIPA (Fig. S2, panel A).",

            "text": "Macropinocytosis has been implicated in the entry of several viruses [12], [14]. However, differences in susceptibility to inhibitors suggest that distinct forms of macropinocytosis might be used by different viruses [34], [35]. By screening specific inhibitors in the Gluc-entry assay using DYNA-IND entry conditions we evaluated the possible involvement of a few signaling cascades that have been implicated in the induction of macropinocytosis. Serum-inducible macropinocytosis has been shown to be activated via a myriad of signaling cascades initiated by growth factors binding to transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors [14], [17], [36], [37], consistent with the results shown in Fig. 5. A prominent downstream effect of these signaling cascades is the activation of p21 associated kinase 1 (PAK1) which in turn can activate a number of different pathways leading to actin network rearrangements that can ultimately lead to the induction of macropinocytosis [38]. Fig. 9A\u2013B shows that 20 \u00b5M IPA3, an inhibitor of PAK1 [39], specifically inhibits DYNA-IND entry of IAV. Activation of PAK1 in response to growth factor stimulation often involves upstream signal transduction by members of the Rho sub-family of small GTPases like CDC42 and/or Rac1 [34], [40], [41]. Alternatively, activated CDC42 and Rac1 can induce actin rearrangements independently of PAK1 [34], [40]\u2013[43] by direct interaction with WASP or WAVE family proteins, respectively [44], [45]. However, inhibitors of CDC42 (Pirl1 [46]), Rac1 (NSC23766 [47]) or N-WASP (wiskostatin [48]) did not display inhibitory effects on DYNA-IND or DYNA-DEP entry of IAV (Fig. 9C\u2013D). Instead, Pirl1 and wiskostatin induced a significant, concentration dependent increase of entry. This stimulatory effect was not observed for the control vaccinia virus strain WR, which enters cells via a Rac1-dependent, macropinocytotic pathway [43] (Fig. 9E), indicating that this effect is specific for IAV. The results suggest a requirement for PAK1 in DYNA-IND entry of IAV that does not require activation by either CDC42 or Rac1. Growth factor inducible activation of the tyrosine kinase src has also been linked to the induction of macropinocytosis [49]\u2013[51]; consistent with this observation the src inhibitor PP2 [52] specifically inhibited DYNA-IND entry of IAV (Fig. 9A\u2013B). Remarkably, 17-AA-geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of the chaperone protein HSP90 [53], also caused specific inhibition of DYNA-IND entry (Fig. 9A\u2013B). HSP90 affects the folding and activity of many proteins but the recent demonstration of direct activation of the catalytic activity of src by HSP90 [54] provides another indication of the involvement of src in DYNA-IND endocytosis of IAV.",

Several lines of evidence indicate that the DYNA-IND entry route of IAV that we identified corresponds with macropinocytosis. First of all, the entry pathway is dependent on the presence of serum, a well-known inducer of macropinocytosis. Second, IAV colocalized in vesicles with soluble FITC-dextran, a marker for macropinocytosis. Third, DYNA-IND IAV entry was sensitive to the amiloride-derivative EIPA, the hallmark inhibitor of macropinocytosis [14], [55]\u2013[58]. Fourth, this IAV entry pathway is sensitive to inhibitors or dominant-negative mutants affecting actomyosin dynamics. Fifth, the specific inhibition of DYNA-IND IAV entry by a number of inhibitors of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases as well as downstream effectors thereof also points at the involvement of macropinocytosis. Finally, macropinocytosis is independent of dynamin [12], [14], [19].",

            "text": "Despite this extensive list of arguments, viral entry by macropinocytosis needs to be considered with caution. The characteristics of the DYNA-IND route of cell entry by IAV are similar, but not identical to the macropinocytic entry routes taken by other viruses, like two different strains of vaccinia virus and by coxsackie virus B [34], [35]. As is shown in Table 1 and discussed in more detail below, the macropinocytic pathways used by each of these viruses have a few unique characteristics. This may very well reflect the growing notion that macropinocytosis represents a number of differentially induced and regulated processes, rather than being a single endocytic pathway [13], [14]. Macropinocytosis has collectively been described as an inducible form of endocytosis by which fluid-phase cargo travels via non-coated, relatively large and heterogeneous organelles that have emanated from extensive protrusions (e.g lamellar ruffles, circular ruffles or retracting blebs) of the plasma membrane [13]. In the case of DYNA-IND IAV entry more extensive studies using electron microscopy will be required to study the morphology of membrane protrusions with which IAV may associate. In addition, live cell imaging microscopy will be required to characterize the exact itinerary that is taken by IAV virions traveling via a macropinocytic process. This is especially important as different routes of IAV entry are likely to converge at some point in the endocytic pathway. Although unlikely, co-localization of IAV particles with fluid-phase dextran as shown in Fig. 8B may thus represent a situation occurring after convergence of several different routes. The use of microscopy to study macropinocytosis is however complicated by the lack of specific membrane-associated markers for any early step of this endocytic process.",

The DYNA-IND route required the presence of 10% FCS in the entry assay medium. Previously, a strict dependency on a DYNA-DEP entry route for IAV was concluded from experiments with a cell line expressing an inducible dominant-negative mutant of dynamin 2 [59]. In that study, as well as in other entry studies of IAV, entry was performed in DMEM containing 2% serum or BSA. Also in our hands 2.5% serum (Fig. 2A) or 0.2% BSA (result not shown) was not sufficient to allow DYNA-IND entry. We are currently investigating which serum component is responsible for the observed effects on IAV entry. Dialysis of FCS (MW cut off >10 kDa) did not affect its capacity to induce DYNA-IND endocytosis (result not shown), indicating that low molecular weight solutes are not responsible for the observed effect.",

Whereas dynasore resulted in near 100% inhibition of DYNA-DEP entry, only 65% inhibition was observed upon siRNA induced silencing of dynamin 2 indicating that the residual levels of dynamin 2 that remain after 48 hrs of silencing still support a low level of DYNA-DEP entry (Fig. 4H). Reversible inhibitors like dynasore [60] offer a major advantage for characterization of IAV entry pathways. They can be applied for a limited period thus preventing the secondary adaptive effects of cells that may occur in response to long-term down regulation of a gene product by genetic methods like siRNA interference. Both entry routes were consistently identified by a viral entry assay quantified by virus induced expression of a luciferase reporter as well as by a VLP entry assay allowing direct analysis of the membrane fusion mediated entry step. The consistent performance of an HA with a strict preference for binding to \u03b12-3 linked sialic acids (from IAV-WSN; our unpublished data) and an HA also binding to \u03b12-6 linked sialic acids (from 1918 IAV [61]) in the VLP entry assay indicates that both pathways can be utilized by HAs of different specificity and may therefore be relevant to avian as well as human IAV infections. Consistently, serum-inducible DYNA-IND entry was observed both in avian DF1 cells and in a human lung epithelial carcinoma cell line A549 (Fig. 3).",

EIPA, an inhibitor of plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchangers, has been shown to invariably inhibit macropinocytosis [14], [55]\u2013[58]. As other routes of endocytosis are generally not affected, EIPA is considered as a hallmark inhibitor of macropinocytosis [14], although results obtained with EIPA should be considered with care as long as a mechanistic explanation for its effect on macropinocytosis is not yet fully clear [62]. Occasionally, a moderate two- to three-fold inhibition by dynasore alone was observed (result not shown) indicating that the capacity of the serum-inducible entry pathway is somewhat variable, possibly depending on slight variations in serum quality and factors like cell distribution in the wells that have been reported to influence viral infection [63]. A redundancy in the utilization of CME as well as a clathrin-independent route for entry of IAV has been visualized previously by quantitative live cell imaging [4]. Both routes were operative simultaneously in the same sample and the specific down-regulation of CME did not affect the total number of entry events.",

In addition, the requirement for myosinII activity was established by a specific inhibitor (Blebbistatin) of myosin II ATPase activity and by the expression of a dominant negative mutant of myosinIIA heavy chain. Also, the regulation of myosinII activity by phosphorylation of myosin light chain through the action of MLCK is suggested by the inhibitory effect of MLCK inhibitors ML-7 and ML-9 as well as by the similar effect of an expressed MLCK dominant negative mutant. Recently, a function for the actin cytoskeleton in IAV entry was reported to be required for the entry into polarized epithelial cells but not for entry into non-polarized cells [64]. When using the low-serum conditions used in that paper (2% FCS), we only observed DYNA-DEP entry that was not affected by actin dynamics inhibitors. Perhaps, the polarized cells permit DYNA-IND entry at lower serum concentrations.",

The specific inhibition of DYNA-IND entry of IAV by IPA3, an inhibitor of PAK1, provides proof for the involvement of these cascades. PAK1 is a key serine/threonine kinase regulating actin network dynamics but its crucial function in several pathways of endocytosis as well as numerous other cellular processes does not make it a very specific marker [65].

            "text": "Growth factor dependent activation of PAK1 has most often been demonstrated to depend on upstream activation of small GTPases Rac1 or cdc42 [34], [40], [41]. Different strains of vaccinia virus were recently shown to induce their uptake by macropinocytosis via activation of either Rac1 or cdc42 [34]. Activation of Rac1 has been linked to the induction of macropinocytosis via actin network-mediated formation of lamellipodia and/or circular ruffles whereas cdc42 has most often been implied in the formation of filopodia [44]. An inhibitory effect of the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 or the cdc42 inhibitor pirl1 on IAV entry, however, could not be demonstrated. Remarkably, cdc42 inhibitor pirl1 enhanced IAV entry and a similar effect was observed by wiskostatin, an inhibitor of N-WASP which functions directly downstream of cdc42 as a scaffolding complex required for the activation of actin polymerization leading to filopodia formation. Similarly, the macropinocytosis-like entry pathway taken by Coxsackie B virus was also shown to require PAK1 activity that was independent of Rac1 activation [35]. Direct examination of the magnitude and timing of the activation of PAK1 will be required to obtain more insight in the involvement of this complex pathway. The induction of macropinocytosis by a PAK1-dependent mechanism has been associated with ruffling at the cell membrane [12], [14], [15], [37]. The identification of sub-membranous regions with increased actin staining by phalloidin has been interpreted as evidence for ruffling. This was not unambiguously identified by confocal microscopy in the experiments presented in Fig. 8 and Fig. S2 and needs to be investigated in depth by life cell imaging techniques.",

Downstream effects of c-src on actin networks proceed, amongst others, via phosphorylation of cortactin by c-src resulting in accelerated macropinosome formation [50].

Interaction of HSP90 with c-src was recently shown to induce c-src kinase activity [54]. Also HSP90 has been demonstrated to associate with macropinosomes, while its specific inhibitor geldanamycin reduced the membrane ruffling that preceded macropinocytosis [66]. Thus, the inhibition of IAV entry via macropinocytosis by AA-geldanamcyin may very well involve the effects of HSP90 on c-src.",

This is corroborated by the observation that IAV particles and dextran colocalize in large vesicles in the presence of FCS. Several viruses have recently been reported to enter cells via macropinocytosis [12], [14]. Apart from common factors like the requirement for PAK1 activation, actin dynamics and independence of dynamin, virus specific details have been described [34], [35] (Table 1). In part these might be contributed to differences in experimental conditions (e.g. cell types tested) but diversity in the molecular mechanisms by which macropinocytosis can be induced and executed is likely to exist and to be exploited by viruses. Whereas vaccinia virus is able to trigger its own macropinocytic uptake [34], [43], we have described a macropinocytosis pathway that is operational under conditions that are activated by components in serum. Still, this does not exclude signaling induced by virus-host cell interactions, which are for instance suggested by the significant increase of FITC-dextran uptake in the presence of IAV. The possible requirement for co-stimulatory signals from serum components and virus imposes an additional layer of complexity on the analysis of IAV entry via DYNA-IND pathways.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses cause respiratory infections by targeting the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. These surfaces are covered by a mucous layer composed of a variety of small solutes and glycoproteins derived among others from goblet cells [67]. This semi-fluid layer in turn conditions the underlying cells and determines their physiological state, including the activities of their uptake and secretion pathways. It will be important to determine to what extent the DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND IAV entry pathways are operational under the conditions prevailing along the respiratory tract. Current knowledge on the protein composition of the fluids covering the respiratory epithelium is rapidly expanding by the application of proteomic methods to determine the protein composition of bronchial alveolar lavage fluids (BALF). These studies have extended the previous notion that BALF is highly similar in composition to serum. For example, just as for the serum proteome more than 85% of the total protein mass of the BALF proteome is accounted for by albumin, immunoglobulins, transferring, \u03b11-antitrypsin and haptoglobin. In addition, many other proteins have been identified both in serum and in BALF including growth factors that can bind to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases [68]\u2013[70]. Thus, BALF is likely to harbor, just as serum, the protein factors that can activate signaling pathways that are crucial for the induction of DYNA-IND entry of IAV. In agreement herewith, macropinocytosis has been described as a functional entry pathway of Haemophilus influenzae into primary human bronchial epithelial cells [71] although the factors involved in signaling the process have not been identified yet.",

(D) Examination of the effect of 10 nM BafA1 on subcellular localization of IAV particles by confocal fluorescence microscopy. HeLa cells were grown on glass cover slips and infected with IAV (strain WSN; MOI of 10) and fixated after 30 min, 3 hrs or 6 hrs (column 1, 2 or 3 respectively). Infection was performed in 0.2% DMSO (upper row panels) or in the presence of 10 nM BafA1 (lower row panels). The nucleus was visualized by DNA staining with TOPRO-3 (red). IAV infection was visualized by staining with monoclonal antiserum directed against NP (green). In the absence of inhibitor, IAV localized to the nucleus after 3 hrs, while new virus particles spread to the cytoplasm after 6 hrs. BafA1 (lower row panels) caused accumulation of incoming virus particles at a peri-nuclear location. (E) Quantitative determination of IAV entry by a single-cycle Gluc-entry assay.

Inhibitors of Rac1 (80 \u00b5M and 160 \u00b5M NSC23766 (NSC)), Cdc42 (12.5 \u00b5M and 3.125 \u00b5M Pirl1) and N-WASP (10 \u00b5M and 5 \u00b5M wiskostatin (WIS)) were examined for their effect on DYNA-DEP (C) or DYNA-IND (D) entry using the Gluc-entry assay (HeLa cells; strain WSN; MOI 0.5; pre-incubation with inhibitors 1 hr prior to infection) and on infection by vaccinia virus (E). When Wiskostatin, NSC23766 or Pirl1 were added at t = 2 in order to check for their effect on replication we observed a dose-dependent inhibition by Pirl1 (60% inhibition at 12 uM) and no effect by wiskostatin or NSC23766 (result not shown).",

            "text": "Figure 10: The model summarizes the inhibitory (red boxes) or stimulatory (blue boxes) effects of compounds on dynamin-independent IAV entry. The effect of over-expression of dominant-negative mutants is indicated by red-lined boxes. The pathway requires the presence of serum factors in the entry medium and results in the enhanced uptake of dextran and its co-localization with IAV in large vesicles (green boxes). We hypothesize that the interaction of serum factors and/or IAV with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is the primary signal for the induction of macropinocytosis. A number of RTKs have been shown to be involved in this process in different cell lines. Remarkably, a recently published genome-wide siRNA screen of IAV infection identified the FGF receptor as a host factor required for influenza virus replication [22]. Activation of Rho family GTPases CDC42 and/or Rac1 has been shown to be essential for signal transduction leading to macropinocytosis in many cases [13], [14] but inhibitors are without effect or are stimulatory in the case of IAV entry. Downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases include scaffold proteins like N-WASP and WAVE and protein kinases like PAK1. Macropinocytic entry of IAV however seems to require a Rho family GTPase-independent PAK1 activation mechanism. In addition, src family kinases, which can be directly activated by RTKs, play a role. PAK1 and src have previously been linked to the activation of macropinocytosis via their effect on changes in actomyosin dynamics, a process which is crucial to any form of macropinosome formation [13], [14]. Apart from N-WASP- or WAVE-containing macromolecular assemblies other actin binding proteins can induce such changes (e.g. cortactin, which can be activated by src [81]) and thereby induce the formation of one of the different plasma membrane protrusions that can result in the formation of macropinosomes. In addition to an effect on the formation of plasma membrane protrusions and subsequent macropinosome formation, inhibitors can also affect downstream trafficking and maturation of macropinosomes which might be actin-dependent, but this is not depicted in the scheme.",
