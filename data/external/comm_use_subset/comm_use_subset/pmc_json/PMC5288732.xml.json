            "text": "In order to identify stimuli driving ARTD10 expression, a fragment of the ARTD10 promoter (\u2212532 to +491 relative to the start of transcription) was cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter gene construct. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with this reporter gene construct and stimulated with the antiviral defense-inducing cytokine IFN\u03b1. This stimulated the ARTD10 promoter reporter gene construct in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1a), in accordance with previous findings20. IFN\u03b1 also promoted endogenous ARTD10 protein synthesis in these cells (Fig. 1b). Next we analyzed endogenous ARTD10 gene expression. IFN\u03b1 stimulated ARTD10 mRNA and protein synthesis in HeLa and U2OS cells (Fig. 1c and d), consistent with our reporter gene assays. Similarly to the findings for ARTD10, ARTD8 expression was also induced by IFN\u03b1 resulting in elevated mRNA and protein levels in HeLa and U2OS cells (Fig. 1e and f). To detect ARTD8 protein levels we made use of an antibody generated against a peptide derived from the sequence located between macrodomain 2 and 3 of ARTD8 (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Analogous to IFN\u03b1, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern, stimulated ARTD10 mRNA and protein synthesis in differentiated THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1b), but not in undifferentiated cells (data not shown). Of note is that both IFN\u03b1 and LPS stimulated ARTD10 and ARTD8 expression with some delay, indicating that the induction of these genes is probably indirect rather than through direct activation of IFN receptor downstream signaling events. Taken together our results support the notion that mono-ARTDs like ARTD8 and ARTD10 play a role in the first line immune response that is induced in consequence of stimuli such as IFN\u03b1 and LPS. Our observations and published findings let us hypothesize a function for MARylation in the immune defense against pathogens.",

            "text": "To expand on this hypothesis, we were interested in functionally characterizing vMDs. As outlined above certain macrodomains are linked to MARylation either by interacting with MARylated substrates or by removing this modification. Therefore, we assessed whether the tested vMDs, besides binding to free ADPr, are able to remove MARylation from substrates by hydrolyzing the bond between amino acid side chains and the ribose, analogously to the three cellular mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases TARG1, MacroD1 and MacroD2111214. We purified His6-tagged fusion proteins of several vMDs, TARG1, Artd8-macro2 and -macro3 and performed hydrolase assays on automodified, MARylated GST-fusion proteins of the catalytic domains of ARTD10, ARTD8, and ARTD7, and on MARylated NEMO, an ARTD10 substrate40 (Figs 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. S2). The proteins were MARylated using 32P-NAD+ and subsequently incubated with the indicated macrodomain fusion proteins. We observed that all vMDs tested, i.e. those of CHIKV, VEEV, FIPV, SINV, ONNV and HEV, which are closely related (Supplementary Fig. S3), were capable of removing a substantial fraction of the 32P-labeled MARylation from ARTD7, ARTD8, ARTD10, and NEMO after 60 min. As expected, TARG1 was also catalytically active, whereas macro2 and macro3 of Artd8 were unable to hydrolyze MARylation1014 (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that the vMDs possess hydrolase (de-MARylation) activity towards several MARylated substrates, including NEMO, a component of the NF-\u03baB signal transduction pathway40.",

Indeed, free ADPr inhibited hydrolase activity of the CHIKV macrodomain towards the MARylated ARDT10 catalytic domain (Fig. 3c), similar to findings observed for MacroD21125. The inhibitory effect of ADPr was concentration dependent. Titration of the CHIKV macrodomain further demonstrated robust hydrolase activity. Even at low protein concentrations the CHIKV macrodomain reversed MARylation efficiently (Fig. 3d). The products released by the CHIKV macrodomain were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and found to migrate identically to the products obtained from PARGcat-treated, automodified ARTD1 (Fig. 3e). PARG hydrolyses efficiently the ribose-ribosyl glycosidic bonds between ADPr units in PAR chains, generating ADPr41. Thus these findings are consistent with release of ADPr by the CHIKV macrodomain. Together these results define vMDs as ADP-ribosylhydrolases capable of efficiently reverting mono-ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by three different mono-ARTDs.",

HA-tagged ARTD1 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Cells were harvested and ARTD1 was immunoprecipitated using HA-specific antibodies from whole cell lysates. Auto-PARylation of immunoprecipitated ARTD1 was stimulated by the addition of double stranded DNA fragments in the presence of \u03b2-NAD+. Subsequently hydrolase assays were performed and PARylation was measured using a PAR-specific antibody (Fig. 4a). Quantification of the activities of the vMDs of CHIKV, FIPV, ONNV, and SINV showed weak activity towards in vitro PARylated ARTD1, nevertheless, we observed a trend to some reduction in PARylation (Fig. 4b). Moreover, an increase in the signal was measured with the HA-specific antibodies in response to the vMDs of CHIKV and ONNV suggesting that some of the ARTD1 molecules were no longer shifted to higher mobility, indicative of some activity against modified ARTD1 (Fig. 4a, see \u03b1-HA of the immunopreciptiated (IP) material). Similarly, no significant activity of TARG1 was measurable in these assays. In contrast, incubation with the catalytic domain of PARG, a well-described eraser of PARylation with a macrodomain fold13, resulted in a nearly complete loss of the PAR signal and an \u03b1-HA staining of the immunopreciptiated HA-ARTD1 comparable to the negative control that was incubated in the absence of \u03b2-NAD+ (Fig. 4a and b).",

The immunoblot analyses indicated that the modifications obtained in cells were less substantial, i.e. shorter PAR chains, compared to ARTD1 modified in vitro (compare panels a and c of Fig. 4). Treatment of the cells with the ARTD1 inhibitor Olaparib as well as incubation with PARGcat served as control4243. Moreover, Olaparib was added to the lysis buffer to prevent automodification during cell lysis. In agreement with the results from the in vitro modified ARTD1 above, PARylation was affected to some extend dependent on the identity of the vMD (Fig. 4c and d). But in contrast to the in vitro assays, the reductions in response to the CHIKV, ONNV and SINV macrodomains were significant, although not comparable to the effects in response to incubation with PARGcat (Fig. 4d). For direct comparison we have quantified MAR levels on ARTD10cat incubated with the vMDs after 60 min of hydrolysis (Fig. 4e). The results suggest that all vMDs tested are considerably more efficient in de-MARylating ARTD10 compared to de-PARylating ARTD1.",

            "text": "The findings summarized in Fig. 4 were obtained by incubating the samples for only 60 min. But the time course experiments with different vMDs on MARylated substrates demonstrated that the de-MARylation further increased over longer time periods up to a very substantial, almost complete loss of the modification after 240 min (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, we assessed de-PARylation of in vitro modified HA-ARTD1 by the macrodomains of CHIKV and FIPV over time (Supplementary Fig. S4). The CHIKV but not the FIPV macrodomain exhibited weak hydrolase activity when compared to the control incubated for 240 min in the absence of a vMD. It is of note that the latter incubation of ARTD1 for 240 min on its own already exhibited a substantial reduction of PARylation when compared to the starting point and some de-PARylation without added macrodomains was also seen by others35. These findings are in agreement with the analysis of the released products of automodified HA-ARTD1 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Incubation in the absence of any macrodomain resulted in the release of some ADPr as well as PAR chains already after 60 min, as measured by TLC analysis. This was slightly stimulated by the different vMDs, with the exception of the macrodomain of FIPV (Supplementary Fig. S5a). Again, TARG1 showed no activity and PARG resulted in the complete hydrolysis to ADPr. These results were corroborated by analyzing the released 32P-labeled PAR chains on sequencing gels and the remaining protein-bound PAR by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S5b and c). Based on these findings we suggest that MARylated proteins are the preferred substrates of the different vMDs analyzed, but apparently at least some of the vMDs can gain access to the amino acid side chain - ribose bond of a PAR modified substrate and thus remove complete PAR chains. We have not observed that vMDs can hydrolyze the ribose-ribosyl glycosidic bonds within PAR chains in contrast to PARG.",

            "text": "The catalytic mechanism of macrodomain ADP-ribosylhydrolases is not fully understood111213. To obtain information about amino acids relevant for catalytic activity, we focused on the published crystal structure of the CHIKV macrodomain in complex with ADPr25. This was chosen as no structural information of a macrodomain in complex with a MARylated substrate, i.e. peptide or protein, has been reported thus far. We performed in silico analyses to identify amino acids facing the ADPr binding pocket that contribute to ADPr binding (Fig. 5a and b). The procedure allowed identifying important amino acids for ligand recognition. All amino acids within a distance of 5 \u00c5 from the ADPr were subjected to in silico alanine (A) scanning. The obtained mutants were ranked according to the difference in interaction score with respect to the wildtype (WT) protein (\u2206\u2206G values) (Fig. 5c). For each of the three best hits (arginine (N) 24, valine (V) 33, and tyrosine (Y) 114) site-directed mutagenesis of the WT CHIKV macrodomain was performed and the amino acids were changed to alanine (N24A, V33A, and Y114A). His6-tagged fusion proteins of the CHIKV macrodomain mutants were purified and subjected to hydrolase assays of MARylated GST-ARTD10cat for the indicated times (Fig. 5d). The vMD mutants showed less hydrolase activity compared to the WT protein, indicating that the three identified amino acids are important for substrate binding and/or catalysis, but still exhibited a visible de-MARylation. To obtain macrodomain mutants with a more substantial loss of enzymatic activity, we evaluated the energetics of ligand/protein interaction for every possible amino acid substitution of each of the three positions (Supplementary Table S1). Based on these scores we generated additional mutants (Fig. 6). We replaced N24 with arginine (R) and tyrosine (Y) (Fig. 6a), V33 with glutamate (E) and phenylalanine (F) (Fig. 6c), and Y114 with valine (V) and tryptophan (W) (Fig. 6e). In subsequent hydrolase assays with MARylated ARTD10cat as substrate all mutants showed reduced catalytic activity, with N24R, N24Y, V33E, and Y114V being inactive compared to the control incubations in the absence of vMD protein (Fig. 6b, d and f). In addition to ARTD10, we evaluated the hydrolase activity of the V33E and Y144V mutant towards PARylation catalyzed by ARTD1. Therefore, hydrolase assays were performed as described before and the released products were analyzed by TLC (Supplementary Fig. S6a). The mutants were inactive, analogous to the results obtained with the MARylated ARTD10cat domain as substrate. N24 faces the ADPr binding pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate-linked ribose ring (Fig. 5b). In this position it might also influence the recognition of the substrate, i.e. a MARylated protein. When mutated to A, R or Y this hydrogen bond is lost. In addition, the N24Y mutant, due to the prediction that the tyrosine can rotate (Fig. 6a, arrow), might have reduced substrate binding. Moreover, the N24R is suggested to affect the positioning of the ligand and as a consequence may also reduce substrate binding. V33 is deeply buried in the binding cavity and forms a hydrogen bond between its backbone nitrogen and the diphosphate of ADPr (Figs 5b and 6c). This hydrogen bond can be maintained in the V33A mutant. However, when bulky amino acids like E or F replace V33, they might reduce the accessible volume of the binding site, and therefore hamper the correct binding of the substrate. Moreover, specifically for the V33E mutant, the negative charge of E might also introduce an electrostatic repulsion effect with the phosphate groups of the ADPr. Although not obvious from the crystal structure but based on molecular dynamics39, hydrogen bonds are formed between Y114 and the diphosphate as well as the terminal ribose ring of ADPr. Similar to N24 it might also play a role in substrate recognition. When substituted with A, V or W the hydrogen bond with the terminal ribose ring is lost. Taking together N24, V33, and Y114 are important for ligand binding and possibly substrate recognition (N24 and Y114) and thus are necessary for enzymatic activity of the CHIKV macrodomain.",

To address whether the vMD is also active in full-length nsP3 of CHIKV, His6-tagged nsP3 was bacterially expressed and purified and tested for its hydrolase activity (Fig. 7). Comparable to the isolated macrodomain, CHIKV full-length nsP3 was capable of reverting MARylation of GST-ARTD10cat (Fig. 7a). Free ADPr impeded the removal of MARylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7b), similar to the finding with the isolated vMD (Fig. 3c). Next we determined whether the amino acids, which were identified as important for activity of the isolated vMD (Fig. 5), were also relevant for hydrolase activity of full-length nsP3 (Fig. 7c). Indeed, substitution of V33 with E or Y114 with V resulted in a loss of enzymatic activity. Finally, we tested full-length nsP3 on in vitro PARylated ARTD1 and, comparable to the isolated vMD, measured only weak hydrolase activity (Fig. 7d and e). Again, the comparison to the quantified activity of full-length nsP3 on MARylated ARTD10cat revealed a substantial difference to its effect on PARylated ARTD1 (Fig. 7e and f). Together these results demonstrate that the CHIKV macrodomain, either on its own or as part of nsP3, possesses robust hydrolase activity towards several MARylated substrates. In contrast, ARTD1-bound PAR chains are only rather inefficiently hydrolyzed.",

            "text": "To address whether the CHIKV macrodomain functions in cells, we co-expressed the vMD or the full-length nsP3 with ARTD10 in cells. As a tool to detect intracellularly MARylated proteins we used GFP-fusion proteins of macrodomains 2 and 3 of Artd8 (GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133), previously identified to function as binding modules specific for MARylated proteins10, that were stably expressed in HEK293 cells. In co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using GFP-specific antibodies, we measured bound ARTD10-WT and ARTD10-G888W, a catalytically inactive mutant, as a means to assess MARylation (Fig. 8a). As expected, GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133 interacted with MARylated ARTD10-WT but poorly with ARTD10-G888W. Co-expression of the CHIKV macrodomain or nsP3 hampered binding of ARTD10 to GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133, whereas co-expression of mutants with reduced hydrolase activity (nsP3-V33E, nsP3-Y114V) showed little effect. Because binding between GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133 and ARTD10 is dependent on MARylation of ARTD10, these experiments strongly indicated that the CHIKV macrodomain was capable of reverting MARylation of ARTD10 in cells. Nonetheless, the expression of the vMD might have unanticipated consequences. Therefore, we wanted to apply an additional experimental set-up. For this we made use of an antibody initially made against PAR, which we found to also interact with the automodified, MARylated catalytic domain of ARTD10 (Fig. 8b). Thus in addition to the co-IP experiments with GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133, we analyzed MARylation of immunoprecipitated ARTD10 using the \u03b1-ADPr antibody. We observed a signal of overexpressed and immunoprecipitated ARTD10-WT but not of ARTD10-G888W from HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 8c). When the CHIKV macrodomain was co-expressed, MARylation of ARTD10-WT was reduced (Fig. 8c). In line with these experiments co-localization of GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133 with ARTD10-WT in cells was reduced upon co-expression of the CHIKV macrodomain (Fig. 8d). While GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133 was almost exclusively associated with ARTD10-WT dots1044, it relocated throughout the cell when the vMD was co-expressed. This was comparable to the distribution of GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133 in the presence of the catalytically inactive ARTD10-G888W. Of note, the ARTD10-WT dots showed some co-localization with GFP-Artd8-macro2\u20133 in the presence of the CHIKV macrodomain, probably because the vMD was unable to remove all MARylation. Together these findings provide strong support for intracellular hydrolase activity of the CHIKV macrodomain towards MARylated ARTD10.",

The induction of ARTD8 and ARTD10 as measured in time-course experiments occurred with some delay suggesting that they are not direct IFN\u03b1/ISGF3 (STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 heterotrimeric complex) target genes or that the cooperativity with additional signals is relevant for induced expression.",

Both mono-ARTDs show N-terminally localized putative RNA recognition motifs that might be relevant to recognize foreign RNA of invading pathogens, which could function as a signal to further develop an appropriate immune response1. In that respect it is worth noting that ARTD10 interferes with NF-\u03baB signaling, a pathway that is critical for shaping immune cell functions40. Additional findings support a role of ARTDs in antiviral defense. These include the antiviral role of ARTD13 and the proposed evolution of several ARTDs in response to pathogens1723. Moreover, several mono-ARTDs are associated with stress granules, structures that have been implicated in the control of replication of some viruses47. Furthermore, and in more general terms, PTMs, including phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation, which fulfill essential roles in controlling protein activities in cells, are manipulated by pathogens to promote infection and propagation48. Thus the information we have so far about mono-ARTDs suggests that MARylation is a likely target of viruses. This is now supported by our findings that vMDs function as mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases.",

In silico and mutational analysis as well as subsequent biochemical experiments with macrodomain mutants and the CHIKV-nsP3 full-length support this novel enzymatic activity for vMDs (Figs 5, 6 and 7). All tested vMDs appear to elicit broad catalytic activity as they de-MARylate automodified ARTD7, ARTD8, ARTD10 and MARylated NEMO, an ARTD10 substrate40. Moreover, ARTD10, and possibly the other substrates as well, is modified at multiple sites2. This enhances substrate complexity supporting our interpretation of broad catalytic activity. This is also consistent with the findings discussed above that multiple mono-ARTDs are potentially associated with antiviral activity and thus vMDs are expected to be capable of de-MARylating multiple substrates. We demonstrated that ARTD10 is also de-MARylated in cells suggesting that vMDs can function intracellularly (Fig. 8). What the relevant substrates are that need to be de-MARylated in virally infected cells remains to be determined. Our understanding about MARylated substrates is very limited at present and only few proteins have been demonstrated to be modified in cells101140. Thus it will be interesting to define relevant targets of the catalytic activities of vMDs and to understand the biological consequences of MARylation and de-MARylation and their potential importance for virus propagation.",

Taking the overall highly positive electrostatic surface potential of vMDs into account25, binding to negatively charged molecules like PAR is not unexpected and specificity is a concern. Despite this interaction, we could not detect substantial hydrolase activity of the vMDs towards PAR chains synthesized on ARTD1 (Figs 4 and 7, Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). Of note is that the linkage between the protein and its proximal ADPr, an ester bond with an acidic amino acid, is different from the ribose-ribosyl O-glycosidic bond found within PAR chains. Thus it is likely that different catalytic mechanisms are needed to either trim PAR chains or to cleave the bond between the amino acid side chain and ADPr, being it a PAR chain or a single ADPr unit. Distinguishing between the latter will depend on whether the vMDs are able to accommodate the amino acid \u2013 ribose ester bond in the active center despite one or more additional ADPr units bound to the amino acid linked ADPr, as in PAR chains. Looking at the crystal structure of the CHIKV macrodomain in complex with ADPr it might be possible that this vMD can interact with a PAR chain25. However, our findings suggest that none of the tested vMDs, including the one of CHIKV, has strong activity against PARylated ARTD1. This argues that the amino acid \u2013 ribose ester bond of PAR chains is less well accessible and/or positioned in the active center compared to the respective bond in a MARylated substrate. As a consequence, complete PAR chains are less efficiently released than mono-ADPr from substrates.",

            "text": "While our work was under consideration, a report was published suggesting that vMDs hydrolyze both MARylation and PARylation35. We note that the results suggesting activity against PAR chains are not easy to interpret due to significant background in some experiments35. Moreover, ARTD1 was 32P-ADP-ribosylated under low NAD+ conditions, which have been shown by others to also result in substantial MARylation in addition to PARylation12. Thus, the release of radioactivity from labeled ARTD1 might be at least in part due to the hydrolysis of MARylation. This is consistent with our findings that all vMDs tested are significantly more active towards MARylation compared to PARylation (Figs 4 and 7, Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). An additional aspect that is worth considering relates to the findings that ARTD1 has been reported to not only modify acidic amino acids but also lysines5152. Thus it might be that the vMDs remove PAR chains from glutamate or aspartate but not from lysine, as the biochemical reaction would be expected to be rather distinct. Together, the findings strongly suggest that these vMDs have evolved specifically as de-MARylating enzymes.",

            "text": "Based on in silico analysis of the CHIKV macrodomain, amino acids N24, V33 and Y114 were suggested to be important for ligand binding and thus most likely for catalytic activity (Figs 5 and 6). Up to date a precise and validated catalytic mechanism that explains the removal of the protein-proximal ADPr is lacking111214. Our experimental results obtained with CHIKV macrodomain mutants, which were based on in silico alanine scanning and calculating Amber scores, are also in agreement with molecular dynamic simulations proposing N24, V33 and Y114 of the CHIKV macrodomain to be important for enzyme-substrate interaction and N24 and Y114 for catalysis39. Having shown that the inactivating mutations, including V33E and Y114V, do not affect the overall structure of the CHIKV macrodomain (Supplementary Fig. S6b), it will now be important to address their biological relevance for viral replication. In that respect the reported findings on HEV macrodomain mutations are worth discussing35. A strong effect on replication is observed with a triple mutation (G48S/G49S/G50A), which shows reduced binding to PAR chains. It will be interesting to determine whether this is due to reduced catalytic activity or altered structure of the macrodomain. The latter could have effects on the overall function of ORF1 or nsP3. Indeed, the macrodomain of HEV interacts with other non-structural proteins, which has been suggested to be of functional relevance for viral replication53, that might be abolished by structural changes. Of note is also that the G48/G49/G50 motif in HEV is conserved in other vMDs (e.g. SINV (GEG), VEEV (GGG), CHIKV (GDG), ONNV (GDG), and FIPV (VGG)). Within this motif the respective Aspartate 31 of the CHIKV macrodomain was considered in our in silico analysis but substitution by alanine resulted in a highly negative \u2206\u2206G value, suggesting that this change would rather stabilize the interaction with ADP-ribose. Therefore, we did not further evaluate D31 (Fig. 5c).",

This suggests, together with the IFN\u03b1 responsiveness of several mono-ARTDs as well as published findings, that MARylation is a PTM that is relevant for the innate immune response. Our previous studies on ARTD10 and ARTD8 substrates suggest that multiple signaling pathways are regulated by MARylation114054. However, for most of the potential substrates the functional consequences of MARylation are not known and more strinkingly most of the substrates of MARylation are probably not even identified until now. Also, how mono-ARTDs are controlled, beyond effects on gene transcription, is poorly understood. Taken together, this highlights MARylation as a PTM of emerging relevance with the potential for an important role in viral defense or more generally in host-pathogen conflicts.",

Sch\u00fcler (Stockholm) and cloned into pGEX-4T1 or pEGFP-C1 using the gateway cloning strategy. Bacterial expression constructs for His6-tagged fusion proteins of the viral macrodomains of CHIKV, FIPV, VEEV, HEV-XDA4 and HEV-XDD12 were obtained from B. Coutard (Marseille). Plasmids encoding the viral macrodomains of SINV and ONNV were generated by LIC and cloned into pNIC-Bsa4. Clones expressing viral macrodomains, CHIKV-nsP3 and mutants thereof were generated by gateway cloning. Mutants were generated using standard mutagenesis procedures and confirmed by sequencing. pcDNA3-HA-ARTD1 was a kind gift from M. Hottiger (Z\u00fcrich).",
