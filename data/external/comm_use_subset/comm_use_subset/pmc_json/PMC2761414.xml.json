Contrast to the blood and other organized lymphoid tissues, which contain abundance of naive resting T cells, a majority of the CD4+ T cells that reside in GALT are CCR5 positive, activated memory CD4 T cells which are the preferred target cells for HIV/SIV infection [1-3]. HIV infects GALT at a very early stage of infection regardless of the route of infection and active HIV/SIV replication in GALT is present throughout the entire course of infection, which leads to GALT acting as a major viral reservoir and results in mucosal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation that contributes to generalized systemic immune activation and disease progression[2-6].",

We hypothesize that during HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 free virus and infected/uninfected CD4+ T cells constantly shed from GALT into the intestinal lumen and are discharged with feces. Therefore, the amount of HIV-1 and CD4+ T cells contained in the feces could reveal the degree of pathogenesis in GALT. Detection of HIV-1 has been reported in fecal specimens from drug na\u00efve HIV-1 infected individuals in the acute phase of infection [8-10]. There is no information on HIV-1 detection in the feces of chronically infected subjects, especially in subjects undergoing antiretroviral drug therapy (ART). Monitoring the dynamic change of CD4+ T cells in GALT of infected individuals is very important to evaluate disease progression. However, due to the anatomic location of GALT, invasive and expensive biopsy is the only current method to monitor CD4+ T cell loss in GALT. In contrast, feces could be an easily accessible, non-invasive and inexpensive specimen to assess CD4+ T cell depletion of GALT, since CD4+ T cells could shed into the intestinal lumen and be discharged in feces.",

However, such studies are very difficult and expensive to implement.

Specificity of the HIV-1 detection was confirmed by amplifying HIV-1 gag region in these env positive samples. In the selected 5 feces samples, identical results were observed in 4 samples with the gag primers. One HIV-1 env positive feces sample was detected negative with gag primers. This might be due to the extremely low copy number of HIV-1 genomes contained in the sample, which could lead to limited PCR detection in the multiple PCR amplifications. Hoek at al[8] reported that no HIV-1 proviral DNA was detected, but HIV-1 RNA was detected in 67% of subjects' fecal samples by RT-nested PCR. Since the subjects involved in their study were in early stages of HIV-1 infection, when the rapid replication of HIV-1 and destruction of lymphoid tissues occurred in GALT, levels of HIV-1 shedding from GALT to intestinal lumen might be higher compared to the later chronic phase of infection.",

One subset of CD4+ T cells in GALT is Th17 cells characterized by the production of IL-17, which are involved in epithelial regeneration and membrane barrier function. HIV/SIV-mediated Th17 depletion from GALT[23] impairs the gastrointestinal barrier and leads to translocation of intestinal microbes or microbial products, which then contribute to immune activation and disease progression[24,25]. We hypothesize that during CD4 T cell depletion, the depleted cells could shed into intestinal lumen through the impaired GI barrier and be discharged in feces. Because of the persistent active viral replication in GALT, CD4 positive cells are constantly lost from the GI tract throughout infection. Since cells and cellular proteins are degraded very quickly in the lumen of gastrointestinal tract, CD4 mRNA in feces has been monitored instead as a surrogate marker to evaluate CD4 T cells contained in the feces. However, it is possible that some of the detected CD4 mRNA were from macrophages and dendritic cells since these cells express CD4 as well.",

HIV-1 DNA was detected in 7 urine pellet samples from the 29 HIV-1 infected subjects, 4 of the 7 samples from subjects (2 subjects were not on ART and 2 subjects on ART) with detectable plasma viral load, and 3 from subjects (who were on ART) and with undetectable viral load. This result indicates that the detection of HIV-1 in urine is not necessarily associated with plasma viral load.",

In this study, the diversity of HIV-1 populations in three compartments (blood, GI tract and urine system) was evaluated. The sequencing analysis of HIV-1 env C2-V5 region from concurrently collected fecal, urine and blood specimens revealed that HIV-1 compartmentalization was present in the three compartments of this subject.",

In addition, HIV-1 compartmentalization was revealed in gut, renal system and blood in one infected subject. The presence of HIV-1 RNA/DNA in fecal and urine samples from HIV-1 infected subjects is lesser in the chronic stage of infection compared to the acute stage of infection. Our results suggest that feces could be an informative specimen in clinic for detecting HIV and CD4 mRNA. Since a small sample size was used in the current study, future longitudinal studies are needed to show whether there is a correlation of detection of HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA in feces with disease progression.",
