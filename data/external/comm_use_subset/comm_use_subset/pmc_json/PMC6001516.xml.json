For instance, because at the time of the 2014\u20102015 Ebola outbreak no available vaccine had been tested on humans, isolation and quarantine were widely used to reduce Ebola transmission in West Africa.1 One example is provided by the case of the village of Sella Kafta in Sierra Leone, where the entire village of 1000 inhabitants was placed under quarantine for 3 weeks after one woman died of Ebola. On that occasion, quarantine measures included a curfew in which people were not allowed to move from one house to the other, which was enforced by soldiers and the police.2\n",

However, we will argue that authorities ought to implement quarantine and coercion in such a manner that they have the strongest justification possible for those measures. Further, we take it that the justification for these measures is, other things being equal, stronger when quarantined or isolated individuals have a moral duty to submit to those measures. We argue that individuals fall under a duty of easy rescue, i.e. a moral obligation to benefit others, or to prevent harm to others, when doing so entails a small cost to them. We distinguish two types of easy rescue that have been presented in the philosophical literature, namely a comparative and an absolute type; we argue that individuals have an uncontroversial duty of easy rescue of a third type, and that, in certain circumstances, such duty implies that individuals have a duty to submit to quarantine or to isolation. Thus, the state can in some cases fulfil its requirement to act with the strongest justification possible by ensuring that the cost individuals bear for being quarantined or isolated is small, so that their submitting to quarantine or isolation fulfils the conditions of an easy rescue. Finally, we outline how, in concrete terms, this could be achieved, with particular reference to the ethical obligations of local authorities and of the international community in the case of quarantine and isolation measures implemented in poor countries.",

Compulsion occurs when, as in the case mentioned in the introduction, soldiers or the police are deployed to guarantee citizens\u2019 compliance. In public health, compulsion is often reserved for cases where public health issues are seen as a security threat for a country.10\n",

It includes core aspects of a good human life such as health, safety, employment and freedom from fear.15 These aspects are all affected by the quality of public health, and as such might depend on effective and timely implementation of coercive or compulsory public health measures.

The central question of this paper is whether the simple appeal to such a duty of the state represents the strongest justification possible for implementing coercive and compulsory measures. Our answer will be that it does not, and that this duty of the state needs a further argument in its support in order to yield the strongest justification possible for coercive and compulsory state interventions in public health. Before explaining why the simple appeal to the duty of the state does not provide the strongest justification possible, and what type of consideration needs to be added in order to have such a justification, it will be useful to introduce, in the next section, one ethical theory that can provide a moral justification for the duty to implement coercion and compulsion in public health, namely a constrained form of consequentialism.",

A common variant of consequentialism, adapted to conditions of uncertainty, holds that the goodness of the set of consequences associated with an action is to be understood in terms of expected value. Suppose an agent faces a choice between a range of possible actions, each of which could produce a range of possible outcomes. The expected value of a given outcome is given by the probability of it occurring if the agent performs the action in question multiplied by the value of the outcome. The expected value of a given action is the sum of the expected values of the outcomes that it might produce.

This principle may thus need to be constrained in various ways, and indeed a range of possible constraints have been proposed. We call the resulting version \u201cconstrained consequentialism\u201d. For example, requirements of proportionality are typically appealed to in order to limit the application of simple versions of consequentialism.21 Similar constraints are also commonly invoked by ethical guidelines regulating public health measures.22 In what follows, we will make what seem to us to be reasonable and intuitive assumptions regarding the constraints to which consequentialism should be subject to when applied to assess the morality of coercive or compulsory measures: we will assume that, in addition to bringing about more positive than negative value, morally permissible forms of coercion and compulsion in public health must satisfy three constraints, namely:",

In general terms, the more harmful a disease is, the more restrictive the measures that a state may be justified in imposing are. For example, it seems plausible to say that isolation is not a proportionate measure against viral gastroenteritis, although it would be effective, while it seems proportionate against Ebola or SARS: the significant threat that such infectious diseases pose justifies imposing a certain level of coercion or compulsion in order to avoid or contain outbreaks.\n",

But it is doubtful that the (constrained) consequentialist considerations we have provided so far, by themselves, represent the strongest justification possible for restricting freedom of movement and association, although they may be strong enough to support a duty to implement quarantine and isolation in certain circumstances.

For example, Ebola\u2010exposed families who were subject to quarantine measures in West Africa during the 2014\u201015 outbreak suffered significantly from stigmatization and loss of livelihoods,26 as well as possible increased exposure. A survey conducted by the WHO and the Liberia's Ministry of Health found that during the outbreak many families in quarantine did not receive food supplies and that communication between quarantined people and their families was often impossible.27 In some cases even access to water and sanitation facilities could not be guaranteed for people in quarantine.28 These conditions do not seem compatible with quarantine or isolation being forms of \u201ceasy rescue\u201d.

According to it, there is a moral obligation to sacrifice something when the moral relevance of this sacrifice is small compared to the moral relevance of the good to be achieved, rather than when the cost is small in absolute terms. So that principle can still morally demand making moderate or even great sacrifices, such as submitting to quarantine or isolation even when the conditions are very harmful to individuals, where there is something of significantly greater moral importance at stake. One might think that the duty of comparatively easy rescue is too demanding. The state might well have reasons to enforce coercive and compulsory public health measures, but it is more difficult to accept the idea that individuals have a moral obligation, based on a duty of easy rescue, to submit to quarantine and isolation, given the great cost involved.

In combining both absolute and comparative constraints, this formulation generates a narrower duty than either of the previous formulations, and should thus be more broadly accepted.

That being so, it seems that the duty of easy rescue, as we have interpreted it, does not impose a moral obligation on individuals to submit to quarantine and isolation in those circumstances. Therefore, in such circumstances, the general justification for coercing or compelling people to submit to quarantine or isolation is weaker than it would have been if individuals had a moral duty to submit to quarantine and isolation. However, even if that is the case, such circumstances are a contingent, and not a necessary feature of quarantine and isolation. If the conditions of those in quarantine and isolation were improved\u2014for example, if individuals were provided with food, water, sanitation and medical assistance (in order to reduce the risk of contagion), psychological counselling, adequate financial compensation for any loss of livelihoods\u2014submitting to quarantine or isolation might represent a form of rescue that is easy in both comparative and absolute terms.
