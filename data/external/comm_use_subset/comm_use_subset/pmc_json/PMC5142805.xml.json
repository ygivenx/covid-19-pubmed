Although adaptive immunity normally prevents disease, adaptive immune priming has not prevented infection establishment [2], suggesting that this presents a qualitatively distinct challenge, requiring possibly different immune effectors. Analysing early human infection is made difficult by CMV transmission being sporadic and largely asymptomatic. However CMV infections long pre-date human speciation [3], so different host / virus pairs are likely to share common themes and analogous animal infections can yield key insights. MCMV has particular value for understanding how CMVs work in vivo, as its host provides the standard model of mammalian cell biology. MCMV exploits myeloid cells to spread [4, 5], and live imaging shows peripheral to systemic spread via lymph nodes (LN) [6], so LN myeloid cells are likely to be a key target for limiting systemic infection.",

            "text": "Host immunity and viral evasion both influence CMV infection outcomes. Which dominates a given context can be hard to predict. Although MCMV has evolved to infect myeloid cells, myeloid phenotypes are diverse [7] and not all support its spread. SSM police the recycling of extracellular fluid from peripheral tissues back to the blood, capturing viruses from the lymph when it enters the LN subcapsular sinus [8, 9]. Viral replication in SSM potentially delivers an amplified load. Therefore this must be curtailed, or at least slowed sufficiently for other defences to come into play. In addition SSM must protect the FRC that line the subcapsular sinus, and are targeted for example by Ebola virus [10]. While pathogen absorption by SSM can protect down-stream targets such as the blood, it is unlikely to prevent FRC infection as they present a large surface area in the same site [11]. Thus the SSM barrier must be active as well as adsorptive.-In this context SSM would capture viruses to sample rather than cleanse the lymph, and would communicate danger signals, for example to NK cells [12, 13]. The subcapsular sinus is a prominent site of type I interferon (IFN-I) transcription [14] and IFN-I stimulates NK cells [15], so it could contribute. SSM also communicate directly with B cells [16]. T cell-dependent antibody responses take several days to become effective, but T cell-independent antibody responses might protect SSM and FRC in some settings.",

VSV induces IFN-I, which protects neurons against pathological infection [18]. Whether SSM respond strongly to IFN-I is unknown. VSV productively infects both SSM and splenic marginal zone macrophages (MZM), which capture viruses from the blood. Productive MZM infection is associated with a muted response to IFN-I [19]. This protects by inducing neutralizing antibodies. However VSV is unusually susceptible to neutralization by T cell-independent antibodies [20]. Viral evasion is often compromised in xenogenic infections, and the best known human rhabdovirus infection\u2014rabies\u2014spreads predominantly via neurons, so how far VSV in mice constitutes a general case is unclear.",

They also restrict Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), an evasive gamma-herpesvirus [22]. How is unknown. IFN-I may contribute as it has anti-MCMV [23] and anti-MuHV-4 activity [24], despite viral evasion. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) MCMV inoculation, IFN-I signals to NK cells and DC [25]. I.p. MCMV prominently infects the liver, and IFN-I suppresses viral lytic gene expression in in vitro propagated liver cells [26]. However the failure of hepatocytes to spread infection in vivo [27] makes unclear the relevance of liver infection to normal pathogenesis. Herpesviruses normally enter at peripheral sites, whereas i.p. virions reach the blood directly [28], bypassing SSM. We show that SSM are a key site of IFN-I-mediated defence against MCMV. When IFN-I signalling was blocked, lymph-borne MCMV spread rapidly to systemic sites. NK cells provided a second line of defence but at the cost of tissue damage. Thus, an SSM-centered IFN-I response was crucial to limit MCMV dissemination.",

IFN-I signalling was not essential to recruit NK cells either (Fig 8d). In fact it limited NK cell recruitment and preserved PLN cellularity, presumably by reducing virus loads (Fig 8c and 8d). NK cell recruitment was maximal after SSM depletion plus IFNAR blockade. Thus, non-SSM myeloid cells such as medullary sinus and medullary cord macrophages and DC [38], which are not depleted by i.f. liposomal clodronate [22], may also produce the necessary cytokines, and the multiplicity of sufficient signals meant that NK recruitment correlated primarily with total virus load. This recruitment was then associated with a reduction in ER-TR7+ cell infection and a general loss of LN cellularity.",

Both control and IFNAR-blocked mice had \u03b2gal+ cells around the subcapsular sinus (Fig 11a). The latter had significantly more per field of view (Fig 11b). Most \u03b2gal+ cells were SSM.

MCMV, like HCMV, has a broad tropism, encompassing fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells, and lymph-borne MCMV directly infected both SSM and FRC. Thus, the need to contain this infection preceded adaptive immunity. Containment depended primarily on IFN-I, which restricted SSM and FRC infections despite viral IFN-I evasion [42]. Innate immunity is inherently polylithic, and IFN-I was not the sole SSM-based defence: NK cell recruitment was also important. Nor were SSM the sole IFN-I producers at the subcapsular sinus: pDC also contributed.

Most pDC are migratory and recruited to inflammatory sites [29]. Thus their response can take time to develop. The early (day 1) inhibition of MCMV infection by IFN-I, including inhibition of viral reporter gene expression in the first cells encountered, was consistent with a key role for resident SSM. SSM depletion possibly under-estimated their contribution, as the ensuing inflammation could recruit other, compensatory IFN-I-producing cells.

Although lymph-borne virions infected large numbers of SSM, the SSM contribution to new virion production was relatively low. FRC seemed to be the main source. A similar situation occurs in the lungs, where alveolar macrophages are prominent infection targets but most new virus seems to come from type II alveolar epithelial cells [47]. Consequently FRC were an important NK cell target. When IFNAR was blocked, increased FRC infection and NK cell recruitment led to tissue damage. This destructive capacity of NK cells could explain why inflammation around the subcapsular sinus compromises subsequent immune responses [48].",

For live imaging we used a derivative (MCMV-LUC) that expresses firefly luciferase via autocatalytic release from a fusion protein with the lytic cycle M78 gene product [54]. For floxed reporter gene switching we used MCMV-GR, which has an HCMV IE1 promoter-driven cassette inserted into M157 [6]. The cassette encodes a floxed GFP gene upstream of a nuclear-targeted tdTomato gene. Thus, cre irreversibly switches MCMV-GR from green to nuclear red fluorescence. Switched and unswitched MCMV-GR show no difference in host colonization. MCMV with the essential virion glycoprotein L (gL) gene disrupted by insertion of an HCMV IE1 promoter-driven \u03b2-galactosidase expression cassette into M115 [6] was propagated on gL-expressing NIH-3T3 cells. All other viruses were propagated on NIH-3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1658). Infected cells were cleared of cell debris by low speed centrifugation (500 x g, 10min), then virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (35,000 x g, 2h). Infectious virus was plaque assayed on murine embryonic fibroblasts. Cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 2mM glutamine, 100IU/ml penicillin, 100\u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum.",
