            "text": "Some populations of geese and swans in Europe and North America have undergone dramatic growth during recent decades and they are now larger than any time in known history.[1,2] At the same time, outside the breeding season these birds have increasingly abandoned their natural foraging habitats in favour of croplands, meadows and turfs.[3] This and a generally reduced level of fearfulness have resulted in there now being more geese, close to more people, than ever before over large and densely populated areas in the Northern Hemisphere. This, in turn, has sparked conflicts with respect to crop damage, bird strikes at airports, fouling of drinking and recreational waters, eutrophication of wetlands, and degradation of natural vegetation. Although there are well-described local cases for most of these conflicts, their prevalence and consequences over larger spatial and temporal scales have only recently been reviewed comprehensively and critically.[3\u20135]",

            "text": "A recurring issue in this context is geese and other waterfowl as sources of infections (e.g. [6]). This is true for agriculture and food production, but also for human health via transmission of zoonotic diseases.[7] Interestingly, this is a rather recent concern, illustrated by it not even being mentioned in the influential monograph Man and Wildfowl by Janet Kear that was published in 1990.[8] Still, such worries are understandable, as it is commonplace to observe large flocks of geese and swans grazing and defecating in pastures and in fields producing food for livestock and humans. This behaviour brings these birds physically close to livestock during parts of the year, sometimes also close to poultry. Another concern is that large goose flocks for prolonged periods roost on lakes and wetlands where livestock drink and humans extract drinking water and swim.[5] On top of this, most goose populations are highly mobile, on a daily as well as a seasonal basis, making them potential disease vectors at short and medium spatial scales. Most species and populations are migratory, in many cases performing long-distance migration from tundra and high boreal areas in N and NE Europe, to wintering areas in W and C Europe. Consequently, geese and swans comprise an excellent model to study aspects of zoonotic diseases and disease transmission between wild and domestic animals. In this review, we apply a One Health perspective to tackle this question, reflecting the multifaceted disciplines involved in the study of diseases shared by several species.",

Partly as a consequence of this, most textbooks and reviews provide information with insufficient detail for practical management of more restricted taxonomic groups and geographical areas (e.g. [7,11,12]), for example in goose management in Europe. Another challenge is the rapid development of disease surveillance technologies, such as sequence and genome-based methods for detection and characterization of pathogenic microorganisms. Importantly, these methods open new avenues to differentiate between strains of pathogens, and thus to understand disease dynamics and effects better. Such information needs to be condensed and synthesized and put in more lucid writing before it can be used by managers and decision-makers.",

Wild herbivorous waterfowl can act both as biological vectors, i.e. harbouring an active infection where the pathogen develops and multiplies, and as mechanical vectors (containers, dispersers), i.e. physically dispersing pathogens from one site to another without being essential to the life cycle of the pathogen. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on the likely risk of disease transmission from wild herbivorous geese and swans to livestock, poultry and humans.

Newcastle disease is caused by the avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1), which occurs in both highly virulent (velogenic) and low virulent (lentogenic) forms. Velogenic strains cause massive die-offs in poultry farms, but are rarely detected in nature, with only few outbreaks recorded, primarily in cormorants.[16] Outbreaks of Newcastle disease are not known in wild waterfowl, but wild swans and geese are important asymptotic hosts of the more benign lentogenic APMV-1 strains (e.g. [17]). APMV-1 does not constitute a threat to human health, but it can cause mild conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms, which have mainly been reported in people working with infected poultry.[18] The other 11 serotypes of APMV do not cause Newcastle disease sensu stricta and are not considered here, although some of them have been associated with disease in poultry and other captive birds.[17]",

Muzyka et al. [22] reported on virus isolation in ca. 1800 samples from Ukraine from all seasons (mute swan Cygnus olor, whooper swan Cygnus cygnus, greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons, greylag goose Anser anser, and red-breasted goose Branta ruficollis), but were able to isolate APMV-1 only in two greater white-fronted geese sampled in winter. German studies based on serology report either negative results (greylag goose [23]), 6\u20138% seroprevalence in breeding Canada geese Branta canadensis,[24] 14% in Canada geese in fall,[25] and 45% in greater white-fronted geese in October.[20] The only studies from the Nordic countries did not find any APMV-1 antibodies in greylag geese (Norway, spring [26] and Finland, fall [27]). Most studies of Newcastle disease have been based on cloacal swab samples. However, already Vickers and Hanson [28] and Wobeser [11] pointed out that it is far from certain that this is the best method to detect the virus, and that studies based on faecal swabs most likely underestimate APMV-1 prevalence in wild waterfowl. Contributing to the uncertainties related to AMPV-1 estimation is the fact that waterfowl can be infected by several different viruses simultaneously; for instance, Wille et al. [29] presented results suggesting that the dynamics of AMPV-1 in mallards Anas platyrhynchos were affected by co-circulation of AIV and avian coronavirus.",

[32\u201334]) from a poultry health perspective. Research to date, however, indicates that wild swans and geese do not have any role in outbreaks of velogenic APMV-1 on poultry farms, and Wobeser [11] moreover concluded that no evidence exists that it is established in wild waterfowl. Nevertheless, to prevent transmission of avian paramyxoviruses either way, wild and captive birds should not be allowed to get in contact, and it is further advised that they do not share water for drinking and swimming. Recently, Ayala et al. [35] provided evidence that vaccine-derived Newcastle disease virus can spill over from poultry into wild bird populations, but at present it is unknown whether this has any relevance for waterfowl.",

Waterfowl seem to be the virus\u2019s only reservoir between outbreaks.[11] The faecal\u2013oral pathway is probably the most common infection route, but transmission from mother to young through the egg also occurs. To date very few studies have addressed its occurrence in Europe, as it is currently not perceived as a threat to the poultry industry. In eggs from Canada geese breeding in Germany, B\u00f6nner et al. [24] found an antibody seroprevalence of 13% in 2002 (n\n = 107), but none (0%) the year after (n\n = 181). A Polish survey 2006\u20132013 of liver tissue from mute swan, greylag goose, bean goose Anser fabalis and mallard showed presence of anatid herpesvirus in 73% of 131 sampled birds and isolated three viruses.[38] Collectively, these studies suggest that anatid herpesvirus 1 is widespread among asymptomatic waterfowl in Europe. Since duck plague is a potentially devastating disease and because the etiological agent likely occurs in swans and geese in the Nordic countries, it is warranted to better monitor its distribution in space and time. In order to prevent outbreaks, domestic poultry should not be allowed to get in direct contact with wild waterfowl, and it is further advised that they do not share water for drinking.",

Among birds, infections vary from asymptomatic to severe depending on species, where outbreaks with high fatality rates have been seen in raptors and passerines such as crows.[40] WNV is of great concern to human medicine, too, as it is neuroinvasive and may cause potentially fatal encephalitis. The WNV outbreak in the USA in 2012 caused at least 286 human deaths.[41] The virus is transmitted by ornithophilic mosquitoes during blood-meals. Passerine birds are the most important reservoirs and amplifying hosts of WNV.[42] Some studies suggest that birds, including waterfowl, may also be long-distance dispersers of the virus.[43,44] As reservoirs for local spread, though, present knowledge suggests that wild swans and geese are unimportant relative to passerines.[42] Nevertheless, following the WNV outbreak in New York City in 1999, domestic geese and Canada geese were among the birds showing the highest seropositivity rate;[45] however, it is uncertain whether geese develop sufficient viremia to permit transmission to new hosts.",

The only WNV screening study of birds from the Nordic countries showed very low seroprevalence (0.1%) among the 104 sampled species, and no signs of exposure to WNV in the seven tested waterfowl species.[47] However, there are several reasons to include WNV in the present review. Firstly, WNV antibodies have been found in mute swans in Poland, Germany and Serbia.[46,48,49] Secondly, the virus has spread steadily northwards, a process likely exacerbated by climate warming.[50] Thirdly, several of the mosquitoes that are competent vectors for WNV are widespread and common in the Nordic countries (Culex pipiens, Coquillettidia richiardii and at least 14 other species), and other species are expanding northwards (e.g. Aedes albopinctus [51]). Fourthly, swans and geese occur mainly in wet habitats where also mosquitoes are common, increasing the risk of virus amplification and subsequent spread. Finally, small WNV outbreaks with 10\u201340% fatality rates in humans with neurological symptoms have occurred as close as Romania, Serbia and Russia.[46,52,53]",

The natural reservoir of the virus is wild waterbirds, in particular dabbling ducks, but also to a lesser extent swans, geese, diving ducks, and shorebirds.[54,55] Naturally occurring AIV subtypes are almost exclusively classified as low pathogenic (LPAIV), which means that they do not cause significant disease either in their wild hosts or in gallinaceous poultry. In dabbling ducks, LPAIV show an annual pattern of low prevalence in spring and summer, and a marked peak in autumn when prevalence may reach high values (20\u201330%) in the Northern Hemisphere.[55,56] Less is known about LPAIV in other waterbirds, but geese and swans are infected with LPAIV, though at a general lower prevalence rate.[54]",

In gallinaceous poultry, LPAIV can mutate into a highly pathogenic form (HPAIV), which causes devastating disease. The increased virulence is largely determined by mutations at the receptor binding site of the haemagglutinin molecule, leading to systemic, rather than localized infection. A driving force for this switch is a high mutation rate combined with high densities of immuno-naive hosts. Once established in a poultry facility, HPAIV is highly contagious and may develop into local, regional or even intercontinental epizootics in poultry.[54,57]",

However, once an AIV has adapted to a mammalian host it may spread and become epidemic in it. It is important to note that AIVs can affect humans and animals in two ways: either via direct transmission (such as HPAI H5N1, which although it is rare as a spill-over infection is associated with high mortality in humans) or via contributing novel antigenic properties through reassortment of avian and mammal AIVs in co-infected hosts (such as the pig, which expresses both avian and mammal receptors).

            "text": "Up to recent years, the conventional wisdom has been that HPAIVs are restricted to poultry, and do not circulate widely among wild birds. This notion has been challenged lately, partly as a result of the ongoing epizootic of HPAI H5N1 and associated reassortant viruses in Eurasia, Africa and North America (e.g. [60]). The severity of HPAIV infection varies among wild birds, with systemic infection and high mortality in most species, and subclinical to asymptomatic infections in some waterfowl, particularly in dabbling ducks. This change in epidemiology is not fully understood, but contributing factors may include partial protection from previous LPAIV infections and adaptations of the virus associated with reduced virulence. In any case, migratory waterfowl may act as reservoirs and of HPAIV and contribute to dispersal via migration (e.g. [61\u201363]). Health concerns for poultry, livestock and humans are the main reason for the huge body of research on AIVs, including their main avian hosts. The mallard and closely related dabbling ducks (American black duck Anas rubripes, northern pintail Anas acuta) are the model species in this research. This situation presents a challenge for the present review, as susceptibility to AIV varies considerably among waterfowl species. In a meta-analysis based on studies involving ca. 45,000 sampled waterfowl, Olsen et al. [54,Table 1] found that AIV prevalence is 10 times higher in dabbling ducks such as mallard, American black duck and northern pintail, than it is in geese and swans. The literature on AIV in swans and geese is relatively sparse, but it appears that swans and at least some goose species face high mortality when exposed to HPAIV.[54,64\u201367] For example, a single outbreak in China reduced the global population of wild bar-headed geese Anser indicus by 10%.[68] If this is a general pattern, swans and geese rather become poor reservoirs and vectors of HPAIV (cf. [61]), as very ill or dead birds do not fly far.",

On the other hand, data on seroprevalence suggest that many swans and geese eventually do become exposed to LPAIV: 0\u201314% in Canada goose,[6,24,73] 45% in mute swan,[21] 63% in pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus,[74] and >95% in Emperor goose Chen canagica.[72] Lambrecht et al. [69] studied 520 mute swans in Belgium 2007\u20132010 and found that seroprevalence varied with age, being higher in adults than in juveniles (54 and 16%, respectively), and furthermore that seroprevalence rate varied with sampling season and whether birds utilized stagnant or flowing waterbodies. How LPAIV infection affects swans and geese in the wild is, however, still poorly understood. Van Gils and co-workers [75] found that infected Bewick\u2019s swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii reduced feeding and delayed spring migration departure, but this study was based on two birds only. Conversely, in a study of thousands of greater white-fronted geese, Kleijn et al. [76] did not find any difference in movement behaviour between infected and non-infected birds. These patterns have been interpreted very differently; some researchers argue that geese and swans are important to AIV dynamics in general. Others, for example Harris et al. [6], argue that Canada geese play only a minor, if any, role as a reservoir for LPAIV in nature. Another argument why geese may be less important is the limited persistence of AIV in faeces and low viral shedding following experimental infection.",

For example, virus prevalence ([72]; data from four goose species in Alaska) as well as seroprevalence ([74]; pink-footed goose) have been found to be higher in spring than in fall, which is opposite to the seasonal pattern in dabbling ducks. Although this suggests that AIV dynamics in geese and swans may differ significantly from those in ducks, caution is warranted as the former findings are based on a much smaller body of literature, and may be obscured by other factors, such as the seroconversion rate and maintenance of detectable serum antibodies. Furthermore, previous exposure to LPAIV may affect susceptibility and disease severity of HPAIV infections, as has been noted in both experimental [78\u201380] and field-based investigations.[81,82] Hence, increased monitoring of AIV in geese and swans is called for, not least since they occur close to agriculture (crops, livestock, and poultry) and humans. Keeping wild and farmed birds separate from each other is a wise preventive measure for AIV. Regardless, HPAIV in wild geese and swans is not perceived as a health concern for humans, unless one is in direct contact with infected birds.",

In wild birds, salmonellosis is known from a wide variety of species, but mainly known to cause severe disease and mortality from septicaemia in small passerines,[84,85] whilst many other species carry asymptomatic infection (e.g. gulls [86,87]). Because of its relevance to the poultry industry, including risk of alimentary infections in humans, quite a large number of studies has been carried out on its epidemiology in wild birds. Further, there are recommendations within the poultry industry to avoid or minimize contact between wild birds and domestic poultry. In particular, the presence of infected gulls and passerines has been suggested as a risk factor for salmonellosis in domestic animals.[85] Wild birds are not considered a main source of infection for livestock, though, instead feed contamination and recycling among farm animals are often the source.[83]",

However, Gorham and Lee [5] rather emphasized the uncertainty of assessments of potential risks, especially in relation to Canada geese. There are no studies directly linking outbreaks of salmonellosis in humans, livestock or domestic poultry to the presence of swans and geese or their faeces. However, the absence of such findings may partly be a result of existing biosecurity routines, and hence it is nevertheless wise to apply precautionary principles and ensure that domestic poultry do not get in contact with, or share pasture or water access with, wild waterfowl. The absence of reports about outbreaks in ruminants linked to waterfowl indicates that in practice the presence of such birds on grasslands and pasture grounds, which is a common phenomenon in many regions, may not constitute a major risk factor for Salmonella infection in livestock. Furthermore, the presence of geese in urban parks and on beaches does not, based on the reasoning above, appear to constitute any major human health risk with respect to Salmonella.",

            "text": "As water quality in lakes and rivers can be affected by high levels of coliform bacteria, it is highly relevant to try to establish the source of such faecal contamination. Hence, several studies have studied E. coli isolates from a host species perspective. Two Canadian studies showed that isolates were relatively host-specific and that E. coli strains from geese totally dominated in faecal material from geese (87.5% (n\n = 7) and 79.7% (n\n = 44) respectively [103,104]). A Dutch study of E. coli concentrations in faeces from geese and other birds on recreational waters indicated that gull faeces contained higher concentrations of E. coli than did goose faeces (greylag goose; n\n = 25) [105] and a study of recreational waters in the USA revealed that human faecal material was as common a source of contamination as was goose faecal material, especially after rainfall.[106] However, geese can also carry E. coli strains of human origin (12.5%), and humans and dairy cattle can carry strains of goose origin (2.9 and 14.3% respectively [103]. In a recent study, Kuczkowski and co-workers [107] reported both geographical and interspecific differences (mute swans (n\n = 37), greylag geese (n = 61) and Canada geese (n = 33) in Poland and the Netherlands, respectively) in the pathogenicity of the E. coli strains identified. An important question to ask is whether E. coli constitutes a normal part of the gastrointrestinal flora of geese and swans, or whether high prevalence of this bacterium in itself is a sign of transmission from anthropogenic sources.",

[124] found that although a large proportion of the Canada and greylag geese included did carry C. jejuni (50.2%, n = 331), these bacteria were from a genetically different population than the ones identified from free-ranging broilers sampled at the same location. Hence, the Campylobacter isolated from geese appeared host specific, and their contribution as a source of infection to humans and farm animals were most likely minor.[122,124] Similarly, the prevalence of C. jejuni in non-migratory Canada geese (n = 318) in the USA was reported as ranging from 5.0% to 16%, but the strain types from these geese were not previously encountered among human clinical cases or farm animals.[94] A Swedish study of migrating brent geese indicates that prevalence of Campylobacter may be rather low (one out of four sampled geese tested positive), and the authors stressed that it is unknown if this particular strain, and other isolates from the same study, are transmissible to humans or domestic animals.[125] In a study on wild birds and domestic cattle it was concluded that although these birds, mainly shorebirds and barnacle geese, shared a common environment during the grazing season, the different host species largely carried their own types of Campylobacter. From this, Waldenstr\u00f6m et al. [126] drew the conclusion that between-species transmission is rare. This is in accordance with Llarena and co-workers,[122] who concluded that barnacle geese are probably an infrequent source of campylobacteriosis in humans, a conclusion which can most likely be extended also to other goose species.",

For example, Niskanen and co-workers [129] found Yersina spp. in 42 out of 105 faecal samples from barnacle geese, but none in brent geese, Canada geese, greylag geese, or mute swans (seven, one, one and one samples respectively).

There are also indications of botulism being present in North America as early as in 1890.[130] In Spain, outbreaks in waterfowl are mainly seen in the warmer seasons, i.e. summer and autumn, due to the combination of high temperatures, large amounts of biomass, and anaerobic conditions in wetlands.[131] To our knowledge, botulism has not been reported as a significant problem in swans and geese (albeit in other types of wild birds, such as gulls) in Northern Europe, and no link between waterfowl and outbreaks in domestic poultry has been established here. For mammals including humans, botulism is linked to consumption of feed or food containing the neurotoxin, i.e. not to contact with birds, which are affected by a different strain. Hence, the risk of wild geese and swans transmitting botulism to humans is negligible, and the risk of transfer to poultry appears limited, and should not warrant any specific action.",

Fallacara and co-workers,[95] who studied Canada geese and other waterfowl in the USA, identified antibiotic resistance in some of the E. coli and C. jejuni strains in their samples (specific figures for goose samples not presented). Another US study focusing on non-migratory Canada geese found very different levels of antibiotic resistance in E. coli isolated from faeces, depending on the type of agricultural land the geese inhabited, in relation to livestock manure. The authors reported low or zero levels of resistance in samples from geese in no contact with liquid livestock manure, whereas geese in direct contact with liquid swine manure had a significantly higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.[143] A Japanese study on E. coli in Whistling swans Cygnus columbianus also revealed a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (279 E. coli isolates from 984 swans, of which 80% (n = 244) of the drug resistant isolates showed resistance to more than one antibiotic).[145] Similarly, Hatha and co-workers,[146] who sampled barnacle geese (n = 30) at breeding sites in Svalbard, found 100% resistance to colistin in their E-coli isolates, modest levels of resistance to ampicillin (39%) and amoxicillin (12%), and low levels against tetracycline (7%) and ceftazidime (2%), but the bacteria were still susceptible to a number of other antibiotic substances. Birds in this study winter in the UK, and the authors speculated that antibiotic resistance genes may have been picked up in that environment, rather than in the more pristine Svalbard. Recently, Kuczkowski and co-workers [107] found a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistant E. coli strains in birds sampled in Poland compared to geese in the Netherlands, and hypothesized that this may be a result of difference in proximity to human dwellings. However, also other explanations are possible, such as the general level of antimicrobial resistance in the countries in question, and also in the regions where these goose populations spend time during breeding and migration.",

In principle this sets the scene for transfer of pathogens from wild geese and swans via water and pasture-land to livestock, but the importance of this pathway is still far from understood. It is also difficult to provide general answers to questions about potential health risks related to geese and swans, as the risks will vary considerably not only within a region (climate and density of birds, poultry, and livestock), but also with the type of domestic animal husbandry prevailing. Regardless, several studies stress the importance of proper on-farm biosecurity and disease surveillance systems (see for example [163]). This is a rather intuitive conclusion, and in fact such biosecurity precautions have been in place for poultry for decades in NW Europe and other regions. In other words, the absence of reports about disease transmission from swans and geese to domestic poultry may be an effect of already existing biosecurity routines. Nevertheless it is wise to apply precautionary principles and continue to ensure that domestic poultry do not get in contact with, or share pasture or water access with, wild waterfowl. For livestock, however, the situation is clearly different, as the presence of swans and especially geese on grasslands and pasture grounds is high in many areas of NW Europe. Still, reports of transmission from swans and geese to livestock are virtually absent, and hence their presence does most likely currently not constitute a major risk factor for livestock in relation to the diseases presented in this review.",

[7] concluded that many wild bird species can serve as reservoirs or vectors for a number of different pathogens, but they found only one case of direct transmission from wild geese and swans to humans (a cluster of HPAI H5N1 infections in people plucking feathers from dead mute swans), and also relatively little evidence for indirect transmission. Overall, they argued that direct transmission from wild birds in general play a limited role in human infectious diseases.[7] They also emphasized the importance of effective public information campaigns to put perceived risk into perspective, stressing that public activities in areas with abundant wild birds carry minimal risk, in particular if people refrain from possible risk activities such as unprotected handling of dead, wild waterfowl.

In the scope of the present review, the possibly most significant pathogens that may spill back from humans or domestic animals into nature and infect wild birds are HPAIV and Salmonella. Modern techniques allowing strain typing show that many of the pathogens found in faeces from waterfowl actually originate from human or domestic animal sewage or slurry or other types of human waste.[153,161] Whatever is present in the environment, the birds may pick up; however, an important question to ask is how well they may serve as reservoirs once transmission has occurred. For instance, Girdwood et al. [86] showed that gulls in Scotland frequently were infected with Salmonella originating from human waste activities (7.8% of 5888 samples), but that the duration of shedding was short (four days) and the bacterial load was estimated to be too low to allow further transmission to cattle on pastureland.

Other authors have found that when exploring ecosystems and looking into global health risks, e.g. avian influenza, in relation to industrial scale animal production, there is a tendency to overrate the importance of wildlife.[168] Nevertheless, the wildlife\u2013livestock interface in disease ecology must not be neglected and warrants continued attention, which is exemplified by the recent incursion of HPAIV H5N8 and reassortant viruses in North America.[63] Our present synthesis demonstrates that swans and geese can be colonized/infected by a number of microorganisms that can cause disease in humans and/or domestic animals, although for some of these microbes there are uncertainties about their host-specificity. However, there is very little evidence of such transmission actually taking place, and we therefore argue that although there are potential risks, these are often exaggerated in line with the precautionary principle. This may divert attention from more relevant risk factors.",

Neither have we included feed quality issues related to heavy faecal soiling of ley fields. In this case it has been proposed that if the proportion of goose faecal material is very high and especially where the feed is not completely dried but stored semi-dried (silage and haylage, often for horse fodder), general quality problems may occur due to e.g. formation of mould or spores in the bales.",

            "text": "As concluded above, we find less evidence to worry about disease transmission by geese and swans than is often the case, also from a One Health perspective. There is a tendency to overrate negative effects of geese in disease transmission as in other areas, for example crop damage and wetland eutrophication.[3,4] We nevertheless advocate the following:\nA large share of the pathogens treated in this review is spread via water and the faecal\u2013oral pathway. It is a wise precaution to keep poultry and livestock separated from ponds and other small volume waters used by wild waterfowl. This advice must be used wisely and should not hinder use of cattle to graze for example nature reserves, also along shores. When livestock have access to lakes or ponds where large numbers of geese and swans stage or reside, it is advised to supply water to domestic animals in other ways, such as troughs or bowls.There is no need to prevent livestock from grazing on pastures where geese and swans are present.In areas where there is a risk of contamination of freshwater reservoirs and other potential lakes for use of freshwater, deliberate and systematic scaring of birds may be used to encourage them to choose other lakes as roosting places.For recreational lakes there is a small but not negligible risk of spread of disease both from humans to waterfowl and from waterfowl to humans. In recreational areas where geese are abundant, swimmers should be encouraged to avoid swallowing water, and proper sanitary facilities for humans and dogs should be provided.Normal hygiene procedures are important for people who handle wild birds, and especially for those who also get in contact with poultry and livestock. For staff involved in very sensitive poultry production, such as the daily management of valuable breeding stock, both keeping of backyard poultry or pet birds and direct contact with wild geese and swans should be avoided.For a limited number of rare (from a European perspective) but quite devastating diseases, such as avian influenza and West Nile virus (fever), and possibly also anatid herpesvirus, continuous monitoring sampling of wild birds should be encouraged. However, geese and swans are not necessarily the most appropriate focal species for such sampling schemes. The choice of species must be carefully considered and evaluated before such activities are launched at a larger scale.As a contribution to minimizing the development of and slowing the spread of antimicrobial resistance, prudent use of antibiotics in humans and animals is necessary at the global scale, and more effective anti-bacterial control is desired at wastewater ponds used by swans, geese and other waterfowl. Where this cannot be met, discouraging waterfowl from breeding or staging there may be considered.It should be kept in mind that knowledge and disease situations are prone to change. With future increasing knowledge about these pathogens, with new or emerging diseases becoming more (or possibly less) common, or with changes in human behaviour or in farm animal husbandry systems, there may be reasons for regularly reviewing these recommendations and adapting them to situations that may be different from the ones we see today.\n",

            "text": "Research needs from a One Health perspective:\nTaxonomic: There is an urgent need to develop (and use existing) methods to better understand taxonomy and host specificity of several pathogens. This is especially true for E. coli, Campylobacter, Giardia and Microsporidia. Also, research should be prioritized about the pathogens for which present knowledge is particularly insufficient to evaluate the role of geese and swans in their transmission (e.g. E. coli, Brachyspira, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidia).Transmission pathways: To be efficient from a One Health and disease prevention perspective, future research should focus on finding out if (and if so, when and where) actual transmission between wild waterfowl, domestic farm animals and humans, and vice versa, does occur. Modern genotyping methods may play an important role in establishing if host-specificity is present, and at what levels, and is a helpful tool in source attribution efforts.Counter-measures: From this review it is clear that geese and swans are not a major source of infections in humans or domestic animals for any of the diseases covered. However, geese and swans are, as many other types of wildlife, part of the total circulation of various microbes, of which some are pathogenic to humans, livestock or poultry. In order to prevent unnecessary disease in any of these categories, the pattern of transfer of these pathogens need to be better understood.Relative role of geese and swans versus other wild birds: It is obvious in some cases (e.g. avian influenza) that geese and swans may differ from dabbling ducks when it comes to susceptibility, and thereby in their role as reservoirs and transmitters. Since many geese occur closer to humans and agriculture than most dabbling ducks, such differences warrant further study. Until then, great caution must be taken when making inferences about geese and swans based on knowledge related to other types of waterfowl.Pathogenicity: Field-based studies should be complemented by increased number of experimental infection studies to better quantify disease progression, bacterial/viral load, and risks for forward transmission.Weighing of risks and benefits: Disease prevention is certainly an important aspect of One Health, but the presence and preservation of wetlands, waterfowl and related factors also have important environmental and recreational benefits. Hence, further studies are needed to evaluate risks of disease transmission in relation to other important aspects, such as ecosystem values of waterfowl and their habitats.\n",
