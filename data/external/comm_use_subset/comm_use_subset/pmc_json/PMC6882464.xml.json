            "text": "Each year, an increasing number of people travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, which attract around 10 million pilgrims annually from more than 180 countries. More than two million pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia participated in the Hajj pilgrimages in 2017 [1]. Each year, about 2,000 pilgrims from Marseille, France, participate in the Hajj [2]. The event presents major challenges for public health, including inter-human transmission of infectious diseases, notably respiratory tract infections (RTIs), due the crowded conditions experienced by pilgrims [1]. In a recent study on morbidity and mortality among Indian Hajj pilgrims, infectious diseases represented 53% of outpatient diagnoses, with RTIs and gastroenteritis being the most common [3]. Between 69.8% and 86.8% of French pilgrims presented RTI symptoms during the Hajj [4]. A recent literature review suggested that etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is complex; several studies showed a significant acquisition of respiratory pathogens by pilgrims following participation in the Hajj in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [5]. In a systematic review of 31 studies, Al-Tawfiq et al. showed that human rhinovirus (HRV) and influenza viruses were the most common viral respiratory pathogens isolated from ill Hajj pilgrims [6]. In addition, human non-MERS coronaviruses (HCoV) were also a common cause of RTIs during the event [7]. On the other hand, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus were shown to be the most commonly acquired respiratory bacteria at the Hajj [5].",

Carriage of more than one pathogen is common among Hajj pilgrims, whether or not they present with respiratory symptoms [7]. Colonization is the initial step in the disease process [11]. Nasopharyngeal colonization is likely to be a reservoir for respiratory pathogens resulting in interhuman transmission between pilgrims during close contact experienced during the Hajj ritual. Furthermore, antibiotic use or vaccines, which target specific pathogen species, may alter polymicrobial interactions in the nasopharynx and have unanticipated consequences [12,13]. To our knowledge, the dynamics and interaction between the main respiratory pathogens acquired during the Hajj pilgrimage have not been specifically investigated, to date. Risk factors for possible lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) symptoms at the Hajj have not been studied.",

Potential adult participants were invited to participate in the study. They were included and followed-up by two bilingual (Arabic and French) medical doctors who travelled with the group. All participants departed to KSA on the same date, were housed in the same accommodation during their stay and performed the rituals together. Upon inclusion, before departing from France, pilgrims were interviewed using a standardized pre-Hajj questionnaire that collected information about demographic characteristics, medical history and immunization status. Pilgrims were considered to have been immunized against influenza when they had been vaccinated within the past year and until before 10 days of the date of travel. Pilgrims were considered to be immune to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) when they had been vaccinated with the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-13) in the past five years [14,15]. A post-Hajj questionnaire was completed two days before the pilgrims\u2019 return to France. Clinical data, antibiotic intake and information on compliance with face masks use as well as hand washing, the use of hand gel disinfectant and disposable handkerchiefs was collected. To evaluate the dynamic and interaction of respiratory pathogens during the Hajj, all pilgrims underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs at different times: pre-travel, five to six days post arrival, 12\u201313 days post arrival and just prior to leaving KSA (post-Hajj). The Hajj rituals took place from 19\u201324 August. In\ufb02uenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as the presence of cough, sore throat and subjective fever [16]. Possible LRTI was defined by presence of productive cough without nasal or throat symptoms; febrile productive cough; dyspnea or febrile dyspnea [17]. Based on the WHO classification, \u201cunderweight\u201d was defined as having a body mass index (BMI) below 18.5, \u201cnormal\u201d corresponded to a BMI between 18.5 and 25, \u201coverweight\u201d corresponded to a BMI \u226525, and \u201cobese\u201d referred to those with a BMI \u226530 [18].\n",

Overcrowding during the event is thought to increase the risk of the transmission of infectious diseases, but interaction between respiratory pathogens is probably one factor contributing towards the development of RTIs. To our knowledge, no study on respiratory microbiota alteration among pilgrims during the Hajj has been conducted. Our results about the occurrence of RTI symptoms are in line with previous results obtained regarding French pilgrims [17] and others [1,20]. Notably, we observed that RTI symptoms occur soon after the pilgrims\u2019 arrival in Mecca, with most symptoms starting between 4and 13 days after arrival, corresponding to the period when pilgrims are stationed in Mecca hotels and are visiting the Grand Mosque daily, where highly crowded conditions are common [7]. We also confirmed that an overall increase in the carriage of respiratory viruses and bacteria can be seen when comparing pre-travel samples and post-Hajj samples, as previously documented [7,12,20,27\u201329]. Higher acquisition rates were observed for rhinovirus with a nine-fold increase when comparing pre-travel to post-Hajj carriage and for S. pneumoniae with a seven-fold increase, but an increase was observed for all pathogens tested in this study. The unique design of our study with sequential systematic sampling at regular intervals allows for a better understanding of the dynamics of pathogen carriage during the pilgrimage.",

Furthermore, an independent positive mutual association between the carriage of the two pathogens was evidenced in our multivariate model. Several studies revealed a positive interaction between natural or experimental rhinovirus infection and S. aureus nasal carriers [31\u201335]. These studies also underlined that rhinovirus infection may facilitate the propagation of S. aureus from staphylococcal carriers to the environment and the transmission of the bacterium between humans. Among healthy persons who were experimentally infected by rhinovirus, the relative abundance of S. aureus first increased and then returned to its baseline level after the rhinovirus infection was cleared [36]. These results suggest that changes in the composition of the respiratory microbiota following rhinovirus infection may play a role in the development of bacterial superinfection. Morgene et al. proposed several potential mechanisms through which rhinovirus may increase bacterial infection [37]. Rhinovirus infection promotes pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN production mainly through the activation of NF\u03baB. In rhinovirus infected cells, the adherence of S. aureus was significantly higher compared to uninfected cells. The inflammation due to rhinovirus infection also increased cellular patterns that facilitate the adhesion and internalization of S. aureus within host cells [37].",

An independent positive mutual association between the carriage of the two pathogens was evidenced in our multivariate model. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage which in turns associated with M catarrhalis carriage. These results are consistent with those of several studies conducted among children with upper RTIs [38\u201340]. In these studies, the competitive interaction between S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was dependent on neutrophils and complement. The additional carriage of M. catarrhalis might alter the competitive balance between H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae [39]. Co-colonization of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae with M. catarrhalis associating with increased risk of otitis media has been documented [41]. Using in vivo models, mixed species biofilms play a role in increasing the persistence of ear disease [42]. Other proposed mechanisms for positive associations between bacterial species include interspecies quorum sensing and passive antimicrobial resistance, which have been observed in experimental models of otitis media [43].",

In one of our recent studies, pilgrims who were vaccinated against IPD were seven time less likely to harbour S. pneumoniae after the Hajj compared to unvaccinated pilgrims [27]. In this study, the use of disposable handkerchiefs was associated with a significant decrease in H. influenzae carriage. Non-pharmaceutical individual preventive measures such as cough etiquette, hand hygiene, use of a face mask, disinfectant gel and disposable handkerchiefs are recommended for Hajj pilgrims [26]. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these measures has been poorly investigated and available results are contradictory [26]. The apparent association between antibiotic use and HCoV and K. pneumoniae carriage warrants further investigation to better explore this unexpected observation.",

In addition, we did not recruit a control group of individuals that did not participate to the Hajj. A study addressing interactions between respiratory pathogens in the general French adult population could be of interest. Nevertheless, our study is the first study on the dynamics of and interaction between the respiratory pathogens that are most frequently isolated among Hajj pilgrims. Our data suggest that RTIs at the Hajj are a result of complex interactions between a number of respiratory viruses and bacteria. Further studies aimed at studying the respiratory microbiota with tools allowing the identification of larger numbers of pathogens will be necessary to better elucidate these ecological changes and their potential role in the occurrence of respiratory symptoms.",
