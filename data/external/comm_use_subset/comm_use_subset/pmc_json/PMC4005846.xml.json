The incidence of community-acquired pneumonia has remained constant over the last few decades affecting 3\u20135 people per 1000 person-years, predominantly among the young and elderly [6,7]. Even if discharged, patients are still at risk of returning to Emergency Departments (EDs) or clinics and being readmitted with more severe disease [8]. Pneumonia is also an important health-care related complication: it is the second most common type of nosocomial infection and has the highest mortality [9]. Due to this high burden, physicians with patients suspected of pneumonia are constantly challenged to determine if the clinical syndrome is pneumonia rather than alternative diagnosis.",

CXR is the main imaging approach in many settings; however, limitations for its use exist. For example, radiation exposure precludes CXR use in pregnant women [12]. Moreover, it is frequently troublesome to acquire both posteroanterior and laterolateral projections in hospitalized patients [13], especially among the critically-ill. Finally, CXR can be a time consuming procedure and its interpretation has high inter-observer variability among radiologists [14,15]. Chest CT scan, considered the gold-standard imaging approach for pneumonia, has its own limitations: it is expensive; impractical, especially in the critically-ill; and, has higher radiation exposure than CXR [13,16,17].",

The search was adapted for Embase (1974-Present), Cochrane Library (1898-present), Web of Science (1900-present), Global Health (1973-present) and LILACs (1982-present). We used a combination of controlled vocabulary of keywords around pneumonia and ultrasound (See Search terms for meta-analysis subsection below). We did not limit our search to studies based on publication dates. We did not seek to identify research abstracts from meeting proceedings or unpublished studies as these are not commonly subjected to exhaustive peer-review. Results of the search were reviewed jointly by the research team and the strategy was developed iteratively. We also provided the two informationists with three studies [20-22] that should be included in their search results. We searched all original articles published in English, French or Spanish. All titles and abstracts relevant to our study were retrieved and searched independently by two authors (MC and NS) for full text. References from selected studies and review articles were manually evaluated to identify any possible relevant study for analysis. The literature search and data analysis was performed between June and July 2013.",

Two studies (20%) trained a general practitioner or ED physician to perform LUS [33,37]. The training approach was explained in only one of the studies, and it consisted of three hours of didactic learning and three hours of hands-on LUS use taught by an experienced radiologist [37]. One study (10%) did not comment on operator expertise [38].",

All studies enrolled patients who probably would have received a CXR or chest CT scan in common clinical practice; described their selection criteria with sufficient detail; and, conducted LUS in a short period before or after chest imaging. Moreover, all studies assessed tests independently and blinded from standard imaging results, and LUS technique were described with sufficient detail. LUS sonographers were not blinded to clinical data. Five studies (50%) used a combination of clinical criteria and imaging as the reference standard (Table 3) [21,22,31,34,36]. Five studies used imaging only as the reference standard: three studies (30%) used chest CT scan for the diagnosis pneumonia in the entire sample [32,33,38] and two (20%) studies used chest CT scan when the results of CXR and LUS were found to be discordant [35,37]. While all studies (100%) obtained a chest CT scan at some point for the diagnosis of pneumonia, only three had it for the entire sample [32,33,38]. Three studies (30%) used chest CT scan as the gold standard in cases for which LUS and CXR findings were discordant [22,31,35] and four (40%) performed chest CT scan when clinically indicated [21,34,36,37]. Four studies (40%) explained reasons for study withdrawal [22,34,36,37] and only one study (10%) reported non-interpretable results [35].",

LUS performed well both as a rule-in and rule-out test for pneumonia in adults admitted to EDs and medical wards. Even in patients with acute dyspnea, where the differential diagnosis can be broad, LUS had good discrimination. Our meta-analysis supports that LUS, when conducted by highly-skilled sonographers, performs well for the diagnosis of pneumonia. General practitioners and ED physicians should be encouraged to learn LUS for the diagnosis of pneumonia since it is appears to be an established diagnostic tool in the hands of experienced physicians.",

There are at least two differences between the meta-analysis conducted by Hu et al. and ours. First, Hu et al. included studies in both children (n = 5) and adults (n = 4) whereas we limited our analysis to adults only. Studies dealing with different kinds of patient populations may need to be considered separately because they have different gold standards. For example, LUS may perform better in children, which may help explain why Hu et al. found a higher sensitivity than we did [23,24]. Second, Hu et al. included a fewer number of studies in adults [21,22,35,36]. Specifically, they did not consider two studies of adult patients admitted to EDs or medical wards [31,37] and four studies among critically-ill adults [32-34,38].",

This is substantially shorter than the timeframe required for a CXR or chest CT scan [13,25]. However, there are several limitations that we need to consider when interpreting the evidence in currently published studies. First, not all studies used chest CT scan for the diagnosis of pneumonia as the gold standard. Second, some studies excluded certain populations such as pregnant women [22,35,37], and patients with suspicion of aspiration pneumonia [35], severe immunosuppression [22], interstitial lung disease [34,36,37] and heart failure [36,37]. Third, the protocol for LUS was heterogeneous across studies and this may have affected generalizability. More evidence is needed to provide stronger recommendations in important subgroups.",

First, the total number of studies in our analyses was small; however, this may be offset by the moderate-to-large number of included patients (n = 1172). Second, we did not try to identify studies not published in peer-reviewed journals. Third, only two studies assessed the use of LUS in non-expert physicians who underwent a short training session, precluding our ability to recommend its use in general practitioners. Fourth, all studies were conducted in high-income settings, and none were conducted in resource-poor settings where most of the cases and complications from pneumonia are seen worldwide. Fifth, included studies did not assess all lung regions, as some patients were bedridden and posterior zones were difficult to be assessed.",
