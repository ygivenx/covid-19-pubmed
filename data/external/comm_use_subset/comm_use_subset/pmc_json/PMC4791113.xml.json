DsRNA was purified twice through a micro-spin column (empty Bio-spin column; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) containing cellulose powder (Cellulose D; ADVANTEC, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain pure dsRNA. The dsRNA eluted from cellulose powder in MQ water was treated with DNaseI (amplification grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and S1 nuclease (Invitrogen) in nuclease buffer (57 mM CH3COONa, 9.5 mM MgCl2, 1.9 mM ZnSO4, and 189 mM NaCl) and was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. The final concentrations of CH3COONa, MgCl2, ZnSO4, and NaCl were adjusted to 90 mM, 15 mM, 3 mM, and 300 mM, respectively. DsRNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A one-tenth volume of 10 \u00d7 ShortCut buffer and 10 \u00d7 MnCl provided with ShortCut RNase III (NEB Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was added to the dsRNA solution and fragmented by ultrasound at 4\u00b0C in Snap-Cap microTUBEs using a Covaris S220 (Woburn, MA, USA). The fragmentation conditions were as follows; run time 35 s, peak power 140.0 W, duty factor 2.0%, and 200 cycles/burst. Fragmented dsRNA was divided into two equal volumes, and maintained at 37\u00b0C with or without ShortCut RNase III (NEB). DsRNAs were then purified using a ZymoClean Gel RNA Recovery Kit (ZymoResearch, Orange, CA). Note that dsRNA purification from M. oryzae was carried out in the laboratory of Prof. Teraoka.",

(34), and dsRNA was then purified using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). After the addition of DMSO at a final concentration of 15% (v/v), dsRNA was denatured at 95\u00b0C for 3 min and snap-frozen in ice-water slurry. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA from the ligated loop primer region using the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen).

Adaptor and primer sequences were trimmed, and low quality sequence regions were removed with default parameters. PhiX sequences derived from control libraries and experimentally contaminated sequences (< 0.05% of total reads) were also removed using a mapping tool. The consensus sequences of viral contigs were obtained de novo exclusively with the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC Bio), and assemblies were manually examined and extended using the Tablet viewer (27). Using the mapping tool, each contig was confirmed to be constructed with at least 3 \u00d7 sequence coverage, 10 \u00d7 average coverage, and 1,000 bp in length. In cases of dominant reads (more than 10 reads) that stopped in the same position around the ends of contigs, the position was recognized as a terminal end. The predicted terminal ends of the viral genome segments were also confirmed by the presence of adjacent PCR primer sequences next to the predicted terminal sequence, except for cases of contigs with a poly(A) tail. Contigs with 70\u201390% nucleotide identity with other contigs were classified as the genome types of the same species. Contigs with > 90% nucleotide identity were assigned as the same genome type and only major contigs were used in further analyses. Sequences were compared against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide and amino acid (aa) databases using BLASTN-plus and BLASTX-plus, respectively (5), and then classified by MEGAN 5.7.1. (18). A sequence analysis was performed using Genetyx-MAC software version 17.0.0 (Genetyx Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and Genetyx software version 9.1.0 (Genetyx). Most full-length small subunit rRNA sequences in the diatom colony were reconstructed from RNA-seq reads with EMIRGE (26).",

Purified dsRNAs were fragmented using ultrasound to retrieve all types of dsRNA viruses in order to apply the previously reported full-length dsRNA cloning method using a loop primer (8). The full-length dsRNA cloning method requires overlapped cDNAs synthesized from both terminal ends for further cDNA amplification, and was only applicable to short dsRNA molecules. Reverse transcription was initiated from the ligated loop primer on both ends of the dsRNA fragment. cDNA was then thermally denatured to allow annealing of single-stranded cDNA with the complementary sequence in the 3\u2032 terminal region. The single-stranded regions of annealed cDNA were filled in with DNA polymerase.

The results of the sequencing analysis indicated that 99.1% of total reads were derived from the MoCV1-A genome (Table S1). Five contigs obtained by de novo assembly were identical to the entire region of the MoCV1-A genome segments attained using a conventional cloning and sequencing method (44, 45) with > 99.9% identity (Table S2). Read mapping on MoCV1-A genomes (Fig. S2) showed that the sequence coverage of terminal regions was generally higher than that of the central regions of each segment with few exceptions. No obvious relationship was observed between read coverage and GC content (Fig. S2).

Sequence similarities between the 22 putative viral composite genomes were used to classify them into 19 putative viral species, and each of the two genome types was identified in three species (Table 1). Seventeen dsRNA and two ssRNA viral species were identified and named Diatom Colony-Associated dsRNA virus 1\u201317 (DCADSRV-1\u201317) and Diatom Colony-Associated ssRNA virus 1\u20132 (DCASSRV-1\u20132) (Table 1). Since ssRNA viruses form an RNA duplex as an intermediate in genome replication, these contigs were most likely derived from replicating ssRNA viruses (11) and not from contaminant ssRNA. An additional seven full-length viral segments with predicted CDSs were also identified; however, we were unable to determine the combination of their segments or reconstruct viral genomes based on information from previously reported viruses. Thus, these viral segments were assigned as Diatom Colony-Associated Virus-Like RNA Segments (DCAVLRS-1\u20137).",

            "text": "A phylogenetic analysis of viral RNA replicases (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RdRp) presented the phylogenetic relationship between viral genomes from a diatom colony and known RNA viruses (Fig. S4). Viruses belonging to the family Totiviridae harbor non-segmented dsRNA genomes and form isometric virions that infect either fungi or protozoa (21). Thirteen composite genomes of Totiviridae-related viruses were identified and classified into four clades distinct from the five characterized genera of Totiviridae (clades a\u2013d in Fig. S4A). Clade c was the sister clade of the proposed genus \u201cTrichomonasvirus\u201d and clade d included Ustilaginoidea virens RNA virus 1 (UvRV1). In general, \u22121 ribosomal frameshift signals [the XXXYYYZ motif (4), in which XXX may be any three identical nucleotides, YYY may be either AAA or UUU, and Z may be A, U, or C] or +1 ribosomal frameshift signals [CCCUUUU (14) or UCCUUUCGU (47)] were located in the upstream region of the 2nd CDS, and were used in the expression of overlapping viral genes such as the pol (RdRp) of Totivirus and Leishmaniavirus. These regions were examined in an attempt to better classify the identified viruses. However, as in the case of UvRV1, \u22121 or +1 ribosomal frameshift signals were not found in any of the Totiviridae genomes obtained in this study. CDSs in the predicted Totiviridae virus-like segments DCAVLRS-3 and DCAVLRS-4 showed significant similarities with the gag (coat protein; CP) and pol (RdRp) of known totiviruses, respectively. Totiviridae genomes consist of a single genome segment that encodes the two essential CDSs, whereas DCAVLRS-3 and -4 lacked pol and gag, respectively. These two segments harbored nine identical 5\u2032-terminal nucleotide sequences, which were distinguishable from the other identified terminal viral sequences. Genomic features implied that DCAVLRS-3 and -4 may be parts of a bisegmented viral genome. RdRp in DCADSRV-1 segment 2 showed significant homology with that in fox Picobirnavirus, a member of the Picobirnaviridae, although DCADSRV-1 was phylogenetically distinct from the known Picobirnaviridae viruses (Fig. S4B). Picobirnaviruses are small, non-enveloped, bisegmented dsRNA viruses that infect animals and humans (21). The genome structure of DCADSRV-1 was similar to that of the known Picobirnaviridae (21). DCADSRV-14 was classified into the genus Deltapartitivirus of the family Partitiviridae based on the predicted RdRp sequence (Fig. S4C) (29). To date, all of the alphacryptoviruses have been identified from plants including the angiosperm, gymnosperm, and chlorophytes (29). rRNA sequences belonging to the Streptophyta, including land plants, have not yet been detected by an RNA-seq analysis, whereas Cladophora sp. of the Chlorophyta, a sister division of Streptophyta, were detected (Table S4). The CDSs of DCADSRV-15 and a few viral contigs showed significant homology with viruses belonging to the Endornaviridae (dsRNA), Naranviridae (ssRNA), or Hypoviridae (ssRNA), whose virion formation has not yet been observed.",

Among the RNA viral genomes obtained in this study, some dominant populations showed greater similarities to fungal viruses than to known diatom viruses; however, several ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have already been identified from marine diatoms (20, 43). We cannot exclude the possibility that these viral genomes were derived from fungi associated with a diatom colony, but it is more likely that they came from the major components of a diatom colony because of their high abundance in the RNA viral metagenomic library. Since extracellular viral particles have been a major target of virus surveillance and isolation, information on intracellular viruses in microorganisms is very limited (13, 37). Therefore, the accumulation of knowledge on intracellular RNA viruses infecting diverse host organisms is essential for understanding the evolution and distribution of RNA viruses.",

In these studies, viral read abundance reached a maximum of 52.7% (2). In contrast, FLDS provided extremely high viral read abundance. The improvement in viral read rates with FLDS was likely derived from [1] a combination of repeating cellulose powder column chromatography and subsequent enzymatic treatment, [2] the fragmentation and efficient thermal denaturation of dsRNA prior to cDNA synthesis, and [3] the selective duplex formation of dsRNA-derived cDNA prior to PCR amplification. Furthermore, FLDS also presented advantages in reconstructing complete genome sequences including terminal regions, which are difficult to obtain using RNA-seq and random priming methods (3). The complete sequences of viral RNA segments are beneficial for the identification of RNA virus segments, particularly in cases in which coding CDSs did not show significant similarities with viral CDSs in databases. The application of a fulllength dsRNA cloning method using a PC3-T7 loop primer (8) to fragmented dsRNA enabled us to determine the terminal regions of long dsRNA genomes. Since T4 RNA ligase requires a 5\u2032 phosphoryl-terminated nucleic acid donor (PC3-T7 loop primer) and 3\u2032 hydroxyl-terminated nucleic acid acceptor for ligation activity, dsRNA fragments with 3\u2032 terminal phosphate were not used as substrates. The terminal structures of dsRNA fragmented by ultrasound have not been reported. However, in the case of dsDNA fragmented by ultrasound, double-strand breaks occur preferentially in 5\u2032-CpG-3\u2032 dinucleotides, and the phosphate group is at the 5\u2032 side of G in the products (15). In this study, fragmented dsRNAs were successfully converted into cDNA and amplified. Taking this into consideration, dsRNA fragmentation using ultrasound with Covaris S220 also produced 3\u2032 hydroxyl-terminated fragments. Furthermore, the lack of any modifications to the 3\u2032 hydroxyl-terminal of viral RNA genomes (21) also allowed us to retrieve the terminal regions of the RNA viral genome.",
