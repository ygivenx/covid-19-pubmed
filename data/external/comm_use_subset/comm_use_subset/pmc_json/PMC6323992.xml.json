Improvements in experimental techniques are providing ever deeper information on the structure and function of individual proteins, whilst large-scale sequencing efforts are driving increased coverage of the complete proteomes of the breadth of organisms that populate the tree of life. Our challenge is to capture the growing depth and breadth of information and make it easily available and interpretable to our users. The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) combines reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries, to which data have been added by our expert biocuration team, with the unreviewed UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries which are annotated by automated systems including our rule-based systems. The output from large-scale sequencing projects form the vast majority of the \u223c120 million entries in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. Improved metagenomic assembly and binning tools are resulting in an increasing number of high-quality metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) being represented in the database. Additionally, we provide the UniRef databases that cluster sequence sets at various levels of sequence identity and the UniProt Archive (UniParc) that delivers a complete set of known sequences, including historical obsolete sequence.",

We continue to see exponential growth in many of our datasets, see Figure 1. We are managing this growth by a number of processes. Most critically, a redundancy removal process was first introduced in 2015. This process identifies and removes almost identical proteomes of the same species before their inclusion in UniProtKB (https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_redundancy) and places their sequences in UniParc. Currently this process has removed \u223c38% all complete proteomes (\u223c241 million proteins) from UniProtKB. As can be seen in Figure 1, the redundancy reduction both greatly reduced the size of UniProtKB as well as made its growth more scalable. This approach has now been extended from prokaryotes to fungi, resulting in the deprecation of \u223c1 million fungal protein records in release 2016_08.",

To improve Reference Proteome Coverage of viruses in UniProt we have undertaken a concerted effort to curate Complete Proteomes and to use these as input for the computational selection of Reference Proteomes. We compiled and curated complete viral genome (proteome) data from INSDC (which feeds into UniProt) as well as a range of other specialized viral genome resources including ViPr (9), IRD (10), the HIV database (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/), Papillomavirus Episteme (11) and the HCV database (https://hcv.lanl.gov/) and HBV database (12). This curation effort included the identification and removal of segmented viruses lacking one or more segments, and increased the number of the Complete Proteomes of viral origin in UniProt to 86 951 (UniProt release 2018_07). Computational clustering of this enhanced viral Complete Proteome set (13) produced 5,887 viral Reference Proteomes.

            "text": "Expert curation of the literature is critically important to the UniProt databases. The information extracted from scientific publications is stored in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot section of the UniProt Knowledgebase and describes functional information both in the form of human readable free-text/controlled syntax summaries and via structured vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) (15) or ChEBI (16). Expert curation is labour intensive, with curators assimilating and evaluating multiple lines of evidence from the text and figures of relevant publications, but this has repeatedly proven to be the most efficient method of extracting all relevant data from a paper. We have previously demonstrated that UniProtKB expert biocuration captures between 35 and 45% of the curatable literature for any given species, rising to 50% of the curatable literature for Homo sapiens (17). UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries serve as a source of functional data for the development and enhancement of bioinformatics prediction tools, so we prioritize the capture of functional data that cannot currently be correctly predicted by computational methods, such as proteins which predictive protein signatures would describe as being part of an enzyme family but are in fact non-functional due to the loss of specific amino acid residues. An example of this is PLC1 (UniProtKB:Q15111), a member of the phosphoinositide phospholipase C family (InterPro:IPR001192) in which the existence of an asparagine residue in the active site instead of the conserved histidine residue suggests a non-catalytic role for this protein. This has broader applications than the annotation of just one protein as information on protein function is computationally transferred from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot to sequence-related, but less well studied, proteins in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. Therefore, it is important to ensure we have a broad enough collection of annotated proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot to add value to new entries as the taxonomic range of fully sequenced proteomes continues to expand.",

This task can be difficult, as our knowledge of protein function continues to evolve and finer grained experimental techniques provide new knowledge that may appear to contradict previous observations. An example of this is provided by the proteins involved in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification which takes place on both coding and non-coding RNAs containing a Pu[G>A]m6AC[A/C/U] (Pu = purine) sequence, the nucleotide A3 of which becomes N6-methylated. The modification acts as a key regulator of mRNA stability: methylation is completed upon the release of mRNA into the nucleoplasm and affects various processes, such as mRNA stability, processing, translation efficiency and editing.

Initial work indicated that METTL3 and METTL14 form a tight heterodimer in order to perform catalysis on the preferred motif sequence. Both proteins are members of the MT-A70 family and are classified as S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases by sequence prediction resources. Methyltransferase activity has been reported for both (19). Subsequent structural studies have now shown that that only one protein, METTL3, constitutes the catalytic subunit (20\u201322). The other subunit, METTL14, has a degenerate active site that is unable to accommodate donor and acceptor substrates and plays a non-catalytic role in maintaining complex integrity and substrate RNA binding (22). WTAP appears to serve as a regulatory subunit. A newly identified subunit of the WMM methyltransferase complex, VIRMA (UniProtKB:Q69YN4) plays a role in mediating mRNA m6A methylation in 3\u2032UTRs and near stop codons and in recruiting the methyltransferase core components.",

The correct annotation on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry will ensure that misleading data is not computationally added to orthologous proteins in UniProtKB/TrEMBL on the basis of an over-predictive protein signature, again highlighting the importance of expert biocuration. Future plans for the manual curation activities in UniProtKB include the development of mechanisms to identify and highlight contradictory information in existing protein entries in order to improve rigor and reproducibility. This example also illustrates the collaborative nature of the UniProt Consortium in that the molecular interactions involved have also been added to the IMEx Consortium (www.imexconsortium.org) dataset by UniProt curators (23), the protein complexes involved curated into the Complex Portal (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/) (24) and both the proteins and complexes have been further annotated using GO (http://www.geneontology.org).

In UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries, domains from the InterPro member databases PROSITE, SMART or Pfam are predicted and used to automatically provide domain annotations. All automatic annotations are labelled with their evidence/source. UniProt has developed two complementary rule-based prediction systems, UniRule and the Statistical Automatic Annotation System (SAAS) to automatically annotate UniProtKB/TrEMBL in an efficient and scalable manner with a high degree of accuracy. These prediction systems can annotate protein properties such as protein names, function, catalytic activity, pathway membership and subcellular location, along with sequence-specific information, such as the positions of post-translational modifications and active sites. We continue to increase the number of Rules used for annotation and this has now grown to over 6000 in total as shown in Figure 4.",

It performs the prediction in four major steps. Firstly, it generates the different ordered combinations of InterPro domains, these combinations are termed domain architectures (DA). Secondly, it calculates the pairwise similarity between DAs using alignment. The third step is that of training. In this phase, clusters of proteins are created, where each cluster represents a single annotation. A threshold of belonging is determined for each cluster while maximising the classification performance, and then annotations corresponding to low performance clusters are discarded. In the final step, the clusters along with their corresponding thresholds serve as models to annotate other query proteins. The fact that DAAC takes into account the arrangement of domains within proteins allows it to make more accurate predictions for specific cases where proteins can have the same set of domains but with different arrangements and hence could perform different functions. Based on UniProt release 2018_05, DAAC generates 7 095 966 EC predictions. 3 880 775 of them are new predictions (not predicted by UniRule or SAAS). Furthermore, DAAC generates 82 285 267 predictions of GO Terms for 20 827 747 distinct proteins in UniProtKB/TrEMBL.

It learns on data from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and uses InterPro signatures and organism taxonomy as attributes to predict most of the protein functional annotations including GO terms, metabolic pathways, EC numbers, etc. With respect to certain quality measures, ARBA finds all rules which would define significant relationships between attributes and functional annotations in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. The set of extracted rules represent the comprehensive knowledge which could explain protein functions. However, these rules comprise redundant information and their high number makes it infeasible to apply them on large sets of data such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL. To address this issue, ARBA puts these rules into a fast competition process called SkyRule based on two concepts, namely dominance and comparability. Rules are then elegantly and considerably reduced in number and aggregated to form concise prediction models that assign functional annotations to UniProtKB entries.",

Our study indicated functional annotations are generally preserved in UniRef clusters due to the intra-cluster homogeneity (26). The GO terms of member protein sequences are highly consistent at UniRef90/50 levels in each of the three GO domains: Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cellular Component. We have started to compute GO annotations last year for UniRef90 and UniRef50 clusters: A GO term is assigned to a cluster when it is found in every UniProtKB member that has GO annotation in this cluster, or when it is a common ancestor of at least one GO term from each such member. We evaluated the GO term prediction by comparing the protein sequences that newly acquired GO annotation with the ones that GO terms were assigned by UniRef in previous releases. The overall rate of prediction precision is higher than 97%, in all three GO domains, indicating the confidence to propagate UniRef GO annotation to member sequences. Thus, UniRef provides an annotation source to our users. They can search against UniRef and then obtain GO annotation from their results.",
