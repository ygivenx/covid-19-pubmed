The expression vectors used for DNA vaccines usually contain the gene(s) for an antigenic portion of a virus or bacteria, under the transcriptional control of a mammalian promoter. Direct injection of the DNA into skeletal muscles results in the synthesis of proteins that subsequently stimulate the host immune system leading to both humoral and cellular immune responses specific to the expressed protein [7,8]. Recently, several published reports describe the application of DNA vaccines to examine the protective potential of several HTNV proteins [9-11]. We have previously reported that the G2 glycoprotein gene could be expressed in cells transiently and retain specific antigenicity to the Chinese Hantavirus strain H8205 (from the Epidemic Disease Research Institute, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China), indicating that the HTNV-G2 recombinant plasmid could be used to develope DNA vaccine against Hantavirus [12].",

IL-2 is one of the extensively studied cytokine adjuvants [13-15]. When administered in multiple injections, IL-2 increased the development of antigen-specific immune response and protective immunity against challenge with the infectious agents [16]. The adjuvant efficacy was further enhanced by physically linking IL-2 to an antigen so that the cytokine effect is retained in the local environment where the immune response is initiated. Previous studies have shown that co-expression of IL-2 has also been shown to enhance the immune response to the HSV1 glycoprotein D antigen in DNA vaccines [17]. These investigations have made IL-2 an attractive adjuvant for vaccine development.",

On the basis of this work, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with the recombinant eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1/HTNV-G2-IL2. To avoid the potential side effects associated with systemic administration of recombinant cytokines, such as the generation of antibodies to IL2 and the neutralization of endogenous IL2, a sustained but low level of cytokines delivered to tissues of immune interactions may reduce the toxicity of these pleiotropic compounds, while improving their therapeutic and practical value in providing vaccine adjuvant effects. Direct injection into mouse skeletal muscle of expression vector encoding cytokines provides such a means. ELISA and cell microculture neutralization test in vitro were used to detect the humoral immune response in immunized BALB/c mice. The stimulation indexes of splenocytes to IL2 and G2 were measured by lymphocyte proliferation assay.- ELISA results showed that the chimeric gene could simultaneously elicit specific antibody against IL-2 and G2.",
