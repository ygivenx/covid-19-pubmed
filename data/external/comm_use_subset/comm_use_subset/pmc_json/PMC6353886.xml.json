URTI are mostly self-limiting but can progress to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) particularly in those with underlying conditions3,4. Adults suffer from a cold two to five times a year, and children can have 7\u201310 episodes annually5. Numerous viruses can cause URTI6. Rhinoviruses (also called the common cold virus), are responsible for around 30% to 70% of all respiratory infections5,6. Since there are >100 different rhinovirus types, reinfections are very common7. Coronavirus is the second most common cause of URTI, causing 7% to 18% of cases8. Other viruses including respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) types A and B, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1\u20134, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and influenza viruses A-C (IAV, IBV and ICV) also cause URTI8,9.",

Three theories have been put forward to explain viral seasonality. 1: The effect of climatic conditions on host resistance to infection (low vitamin D levels following lack of sun exposure can affect our ability to fight infection)9,10. 2: The effect of meteorological factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) on virus survival and hence on infection rates9,11. 3: The effect of behavioural changes on transmission (e.g. spending more time indoors in close proximity to others or aggregation of susceptible children at schools during the colder months)8,9. There are other hypothesis such as diminished immune responses in a chilled host, or the reactivation of dormant viruses by chilling for the increase in URTI during the colder months12.",

In a guinea pig model, IAV transmission is more effective in cold and dry conditions13. Integrity of IAV envelopes are better at lower temperatures, whilst in warm temperatures, the envelope becomes disordered and the virus susceptible to damage14. Reports suggest that IAV survival is better associated with absolute humidity (which measures the amount of water vapour in air regardless of the temperature) rather than relative humidity15,16. An association of absolute humidity with hospitalisation due to influenza LRTI (but not with LRTI due to Rhinovirus or RSV) has recently been reported17.",

Dew point has a similar pattern of relationship to viruses as temperature, with RSV (3.7 \u00b0C), IAV (3.9 \u00b0C), IBV (3.3 \u00b0C) and HMPV (4.4 \u00b0C) preferring lower dew points. In contrast, HPIV-3 prefers a higher dew point (5.9 \u00b0C). Temperature and dew point are both significantly lower on days adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV, and HMPV are present (Table 3).",

It demonstrates how a unit increase in each meteorological variable (either 1 \u00b0C for mean temperature, or 1% for mean relative humidity or \u201chumidity-range\u201d) alters the odds of a virus being present. Only results that were found to be significant in the t-test were examined using logistic regression (i.e. rhinovirus and HPIV-2 were excluded). Following the logistic regression, no significant association was found for HPIV-1. A mean temperature increase by 1 \u00b0C reduces the odds of detecting adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV and HMPV. Adenovirus has a small decrease (2.8%), while RSV (17.3%), IAV (13.7%), IBV (13%) and HMPV (9.9%) have larger decreases. A 1% increase in relative humidity reduces the odds of HPIV-3 being present (2.6%). A 1% increase in \u201chumidity-range\u201d also decreases the odds of detecting RSV (3.8%) and IAV (1.7%). Air temperature has a significant effect against the most number of viruses (n = 5) followed by \u201chumidity-range\u201d and relative humidity. The smaller effect of \u201chumidity-range\u201d in comparison to mean temperature may be due to an interrelationship between mean humidity and \u201chumidity-range\u201d, since logistic regression takes multiple variables into account.",

After this, there are peaks of IBV in February, HMPV and Adenovirus in March, HPIV-3 in May, HPIV-1 in the end of October, rhinoviruses, and HPIV-2 in November, and ending with RSV in December. Since temperature and humidity appear to have a significant impact on viral incidence when analysed individually, we calculated the difference in mean temperature and humidity preferred by the different viruses and arranged them in the order as above (Table 5). Figure 5 represents this pattern visually using results from ANOVA. Starting with the seasonal peak of IAV in January, there is a decrease in relative humidity from 82.9% to 81.7% in February, along with a decrease in mean temperature from 6.7 \u00b0C to 6.3 \u00b0C. These changes are associated with peaks in incidence of IBV. Following this, relative humidity stabilises until March. However, the mean temperature rises significantly to 7.4 \u00b0C in March corresponding with the peak in HMPV and then further to 8.8 \u00b0C when a peak in adenovirus occurs. Next, there is a further increase in temperature to 9.4 \u00b0C along with a significant reduction in relative humidity to 79.9% in May when a peak in HPIV-3 is observed. A slight drop in mean temperature (8.4 \u00b0C) and a significant increase in mean relative humidity (82.6%), from May to October is associated with a peak in HPIV-1. With mean temperatures being fairly constant, a further drop in relative humidity (81.6%) is associated with a peak in rhinovirus activity in November. A slight increase in humidity and a drop in temperature in November is associated with the presence of HPIV-2. A dramatic drop in temperature to 6.2 \u00b0C and an increase in relative humidity to 84.0%, leads to the peak in RSV in December. Then the cycle begins anew with IAV in January.",

RSV and IAV appear to be associated with lower temperatures, dew point, \u201chumidity-range\u201d and high humidity, however, by logistic regression significant association is only seen with lower temperatures and lower \u201chumidity-ranges\u201d.

IBV has a biennial pattern in Edinburgh unlike the bimodal pattern from Okinawa, a subtropical region in Japan26. This suggests that local meteorological variation and factors affecting transmission and herd immunity might have a role to play in viral seasonality.

            "text": "Both RSV and IAV appear when the relative humidity is high (83% to 84%) in Edinburgh. Others have reported variable findings, with some reporting a positive association18, and others reporting that enveloped viruses are better transmitted in low humidity32. For example, Iha Y et al. reported an inverse correlation with relative humidity for influenza A and a direct association with relative humidity for influenza B from Japan26. Since relative humidity is significantly associated only with HPIV-3 on logistic regression, the absolute value of humidity may be less important than fluctuation in humidity to the survival of the virus, particularly with viruses predominantly seen in the Autumn and Winter. It is possible that temperature and \u201chumidity-range\u201d could both have a combined impact on viral stability. In laboratory conditions, RSV survives for longer at lower temperatures, with infectivity falling rapidly as temperature increases. It is known that freezing and thawing leads to marked reduction in infectivity of RSV33. The preference for a narrow \u201chumidity-range\u201d and the change in relative humidity associated with changes in temperature34 could explain why viruses are not stable in frost-free freezers which have to warm up regularly to prevent accumulation of ice in the freezer compartment. This needs further investigation. HPIV 1-3, despite being enveloped RNA viruses, seems to prefer warmer temperatures (8.2 \u00b0C-9.4 \u00b0C) than the other enveloped RNA viruses. Due to its low incidence over our study period, the seasonality of HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 remain unclear though the GLM suggests it is around October-November. There is a possibility of a biennial seasonality for HPIV-1, similar to that reported in the US35, but the trend remains unclear due to the low prevalence in our study. Unlike HPIV-1 and 2, HPIV-3 increases when temperature is highest (9.4 \u00b0C) and when relative humidity is lowest (79.9%). HPIV-3 also appears to tolerate large variations in \u201chumidity-range\u201d (29.7%). Following logistic regression, HPIV-3 is associated with lower relative humidity. The seasonal peak for HPIV-3 in May35, its stability at lower relative humidity36 and higher temperatures28,36 have been reported previously. Our results indicate that most viruses prefer stable humidity (i.e. a lower \u201chumidity-range\u201d) through the day. This requires confirmation from further studies.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to this study. There is a possibility that the samples tested may include those who do not live in the catchment area. As the data is anonymised, it is not possible to determine whether the individuals are tourists or residents of the area. However, since all samples tested over the time period were analysed we believe that it is as representative as it can be. And, as the incubation period in viral respiratory infections is relatively short, it is unlikely that a viral infection will have originated abroad unless the patient was infected just prior to travelling to Edinburgh, which should be a relatively small percentage of the overall population examined in this study. Another limitation is that our data only represents those who sought medical care and were then tested. Hence a time lag between the individual becoming infected, becoming symptomatic and subsequently becoming unwell enough to require medical attention is present. We have not corrected our data for incubation period or for duration of illness prior to sampling. We have analysed the proportion of positive results for each virus for each day. Since proportion depends both on the number of positive results and on the total number of samples tested, it does not directly reflect the number of positive cases. We did not analyse coronavirus seasonality as it was not part of the routine testing panel during that period. Since meteorological factors can be interlinked (e.g. dew point and relative humidity), examining the effects of individual meteorological factors on viral seasonality can lead to an incomplete picture37. We hence attempted to tease this out by performing logistic regression on variables which showed an association in the univariate analysis. Since dew point was removed to prevent collinearity affecting the results of logistic regression, a new regression could in the future be performed to analyse the impact of dew point by removing temperature. There is a preference for stable \u201chumidity-range\u201d in most enveloped viruses except for HPIV-3. Following a visual inspection of the minimum and maximum for each variable and comparison with virus seasonality patterns for different viruses, there appeared to be a relationship between \u201chumidity-range\u201d and viral seasonality. Hence, we investigated the relationship between \u201chumidity-range\u201d and viral seasonality. It would be interesting to assess if a similar relationship is seen with other ranges such as \u201ctemperature-range\u201d, \u201cdew point-range\u201d, etc in the future. Relationship with other variables appears to be virus specific. Therefore, we need models which can investigate multiple variables for each virus. Changes in weather, human behaviour and the immune system can all affect an agent\u2019s seasonality and are all interlinked, as seen in the decrease in vitamin D in temperate climates due to the decrease in daylight hours (shorter/cloudier days). This also makes it difficult to describe the effect of weather on viral seasonality in isolation. Finally, the GLM used in this study has some disadvantages. The GLM used does not account for the lag period between people becoming infected and then seeking medical help, and it also cannot model the multiple peaks seen for rhinoviruses. Furthermore, average data was used to calculate the GLM. This has led to some of the curves not being as smooth as when yearly data is analysed (for e.g. from 2011 a year when peaks were seen for all viruses (Supplementary Fig. 1)). The two steps seen in the curves correspond to the start and end date and probably reflect the lack of samples from January to March in 2009 and the month of December in 2015 as we have analysed data from April 2009 and November 2015. Despite this, the average data over the 6.5 years is very similar to that from 2011. This helps confirm the seasonality for most viruses. There may be differences in individual years as can be seen for adenovirus which had a peak seasonality in December in 2011.",

The further you are from the equator, winter seasonality and or association with monsoon rains is notable39,40. Our findings on \u201chumidity-ranges\u201d need confirmation in a tropical setting.
