Improvements in both air quality and health effects have been documented following a number of large-scale changes in local air pollution emissions, including copper smelters in the Southwestern United States [1], bitumous coal burning in Dublin, Ireland [2], lowered sulfur content for fuel oil and gasoline in Hong Kong [3], closure of pollution-emitting industries in East Germany [4], reduction of traffic during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta [5], and reduction of traffic during the Summer Asian Games in Busan, South Korea [6]. Studies have also been done following the closure of the Utah Valley Steel Mill [7,8] and on the impact of the air pollution-lowering steps adopted prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics [9,10]. In many of these studies the intervention led to significant reductions in negative health effect metrics for the affected populations.",

The refinery was designed for production of consumer-grade gasoline and by-products such as asphalt and kerosene. It was located near the shore of Lake Ontario and produced 13,200 cubic meters of gasoline per day (approximately 90,000 barrels) [11]. The refinery was built in 1958 [12] and closed and decommissioned over a six-month period from October 2004 to March 2005. There remains a small-scale oil terminal at the location, but air pollution emissions, in particular SO2, have been almost completely eliminated after the refinery closure. Ambient measurements of air pollution for the city were more complete than site-specific emissions data for the study period, as the site-specific monitor was removed before the refinery closure. Considering the relatively small population size of Oakville, we examined respiratory-related morbidity, as there were more hospital admissions than deaths, providing more statistical power. Thus, in this study we focused on the changes in ambient air pollution in relation to those in morbidity records to measure the impact of the refinery closure on public health.",

Daily values of sulfur dioxide, the indicator pollutant for the oil refinery emissions, were available for 1996\u20132002 at the Refinery station, and for 2003\u20132007 at the Oakville station. The Refinery station was closed in 2002 and the Oakville station was opened as a replacement in 2003. Figure 1 shows the two designated sites in the refinery region for the time period of interest, as well as a few stations from surrounding areas, including two NAPS stations (Stations 60430 and 60433) in Toronto and one station (63001) to the southwest in the city of Burlington, ON. The Refinery and Oakville stations in Figure 1 recorded air pollutant monitoring data for some portion of the study period (1996\u20132012), although no one station has complete data for the entire period.

We use this cold-season peak-centered morbidity method to compare Oakville to Toronto. These results, aggregated and simplified to a single count (as a rate per thousand persons per year), were then fit using a simple segmented regression model as follows: (2)Rt=\u03b20+\u03b21t+\u03b22It\nwhere Rt is the yearly rate, t a time variable (year), and It an indicator variable for the intervention, with the \u03b2 elements coefficients of the same.

In an attempt at identifying any further reduction that might plausibly be related to the refinery closure in 2004, we compared two time periods, 2003\u20132004 versus 2005\u20132007, restricting attention to wind direction from the south-west to allow for winds to carry refinery emissions to station 61603. For this data, the wind direction-restricted average hourly ambient SO2 fell further by 20% after the refinery closure (from 4.92 ppb to 3.94 ppb). Against this, the ambient, unrestricted ambient concentration dropped 0.4 ppb, from 2.62 ppb to 2.26 ppb. This larger reduction for the sub-case of wind from the south-west (10% of observed hourly samples) may reflect the impact of the refinery closure. In addition, it appears that the variability of the exposure in both stations decreased, indicating that extreme events were less likely to occur post-closure. Table 3 gives means (\u00b5) and standard deviations (s) for N available hourly observations of both all cases and wind-direction-restricted data (winds originating from the southwest) for the two periods.",

Eliminating 2003 as a clear outlier (attributed to the SARS epidemic) and excluding 2005 as the pivot year for refinery closure, we found a significant (p=0.0006) mean difference between the period before the closure (1996\u20132004) and afterwards (2006\u20132012) using a simple segmented linear regression model, as detailed in Equation (2) (details in Table 5 and Figure 3). We found no significant differences in all-cause (non-accidental), circulatory and non-cardiorespiratory related hospitalizations before and after the refinery closure (not shown here). Note that when data from 2003 and 2005 were included in the analysis, although the exact values changed, the conclusions did not; similarly, allowing 2005 to be considered as \u201cafter\u201d closure did not change the conclusions. This result indicates that our finding on the Oakville respiratory hospitalizations is insensitive to the inclusion of the two specific years in question. In summary, cold-season peak-centered respiratory hospitalizations in Oakville fell by 2.2 cases per thousand persons per year (approximately 180 total hospitalizations for the year) from before the refinery closure to after, excluding the two outlier years. Across the same period, no immediate decrease (after accounting for trend) was found in Toronto. ",

Use of SO2 as a proxy for overall refinery emissions is a sensible choice, as SO2 is known to be related to morbidity (hospitalizations), both in general [27,28,29,30,31,32] and specifically for the Canadian population [33,34]. While associations between SO2 and morbidity are positive and significant, they are small in magnitude, so any association between refinery closure and health outcomes cannot be necessarily directly attributed to this pollutant, however use of SO2 as a representative proxy of the whole seems reasonable. At the same time, no other ambient air pollutants with available data showed statistically significant reductions of step-function nature after the refinery closure, despite the clear reduction (6000 tons per year for SO2, Table 2) in emissions, so again, the use of SO2 is justified.",

Comparing the before- and after-closure periods, we found a statistically significant (step-function) reduction of ambient SO2 concentration levels in Oakville only, not in Toronto.

From July 2002 to 2005, there was an interim annual average sulfur content of 150 ppm. The ambient concentration reduction happened quite sharply in 2002\u20132003, despite the regulation rolling out in phases, as most fuel manufacturers moved their facilities to the new standard in time for the initiation of the regulation. Similar regulatory changes were implemented in June 2006 for diesel fuel, with a reduction from 500 to 15 ppm [35]. These changes, together with more restrictions on power plants and industry, led to a decrease in the Ontario average annual ambient concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from approximately 6 ppb to 2.2 ppb across the 2000\u20132013 period [36,37]. The step-wise decrease in ambient SO2 levels observed in Oakville appears to be in addition to the background decrease in SO2 levels associated with the reduction in allowable sulfur content in gasoline, as seen in ambient concentrations of nearby municipalities.",

The area directly co-located with the refinery saw very little population growth (0\u20133%) during this time. In addition, the age distribution skewed toward retirees through this period, with the demographic profile aging over the decade; much of this aging should have been compensated for by the standardization of hospitalization records. Any residual effect not compensated for by this modeling (due to population demographics being temporally coarse owing to census patterns) should have been in the direction of an aging population, which should result in increased levels of hospitalizations rather than the opposite.",
