            "text": "In 2015, there were 186 confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea, and 38 deaths from MERS [1]. An investigation analyzed main causes of a failure to prevent these deaths after the MERS outbreak. One of the causes was lack of a national system or effective coordination between experts in managing risk communication at that time [2]. MERS prevention measures were not transmitted in a timely manner through official channels. Instead, inaccurate health-related information proliferated, leading to disease phobia and hysteria among the population [2]. In the case of avian influenza in 2003, media coverage focused overwhelmingly on one aspect of the disease. For this reason, analysis of the virus, infectious pathways, the extent to which the disease spread, preventive measures that could have been taken, and safety issues were relatively neglected [3]. Media plays a critical role in the formation of the population\u2019s perception of social issues [4]. When a new infectious disease emerges, an unfamiliar population perceives that disease according to media reports. Uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the issue are often high [5, 6]. However, this is not the first experience of such a phenomenon amongst Koreans. This is a re-enactment of the disease phobia that transpired in 2008 during the mad cow disease crisis. The recurrence reveals that, despite governmental efforts, Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) and risk communication strategies have not been sufficiently established or improved in Korea.",

This study identified the association between media use and seeking health information about vaccinations. As discussed above, various factors may affect vaccination rates. These factors impact communication inequality. Communication inequality refers to the theory that a gap in accessibility to information and the ability to process that information exists between social classes [21]. As shown in Fig. 1, it defined as the difference in exposure to public health communication messages and the capacity to access, process, and act upon information, are influenced by social determinants, and may result in significant disparities in health-related knowledge, behavior choices, and ultimately, health outcomes [8]. This study was conducted to reduce communication inequality and identify appropriate risk communication strategies that may increase the vaccination rate.\n",

This study was conducted to identify socio-contextual factors that promote preventative behavior regarding vaccinations from the perspective of health communication. Results of this study revealed those that actively engaged in HISB were more likely to be vaccinated than those that did not actively engage in HISB. This matches results of earlier studies revealing an association between media use, HISB and vaccination rates [8]. Media use promotes healthy practices as it provides a means of communicating and explaining healthcare-related knowledge to the population [22]. The population is positively or negatively influenced by media in addition to medical staff and family members relative to critical behavioral decisions such as being vaccinated. For example, pregnant women using the Internet are influenced by other pregnant women\u2019s positive experiences with vaccinations [23]. Health information seeking behavior and use of media significantly influence healthy lifestyles, early diagnosis, and sensible disease management [24]. Meanwhile, vaccination rates were higher with female respondents that have high income levels, or underlying diseases. Those suffering from chronic diseases were more attuned to the significance of disease prevention. Respondents sought disease-related information more often than those that are healthy. Such tendencies regarding information seeking promoted disease prevention behavior such as being vaccinated, consistent with results of previous studies [15, 17]. However, those with lower socio-economic or health status had less accessibility to information or capacity to use that information, that is in agreement with results of previous studies [19, 20]. Consequently, it is imperative to increase health equity in vaccination rates by mitigating communication inequalities.",

For example, disease prevention behavior including vaccination may be promoted if information accessibility is heightened and an individual\u2019s health information-seeking capacity is strengthened in populations with serious health inequality, especially for those with low income [16, 25]. Previous studies have mainly focused on determining risk factors for health inequality. Studies on protective factors have been insufficient. This study reveals how health communication variables are linked to vaccination status. Consequently, it is critical to consider policies that will reduce health disparities stemming from communication inequality by providing useful information on new infectious diseases or vaccination in an easily accessible manner to vulnerable groups often excluded from valuable health-related information. From the perspective of health communication, it cannot be stated with certainty that the use of media or exposure to specific health information will lead to respondents\u2019 behavior only in a positive direction (e.g., vaccination uptake). This is because while content of news is thoroughly verified for network television, information on the Internet includes inaccurate and misleading news and anti-vaccine information as well. Such organizations create closed or secret websites and exchange information among themselves to avoid social controversy. Our study used searches only on Internet news, excluding social networking services (SNS) and blogs to preserve integrity and reliability. To understand how specific health information through certain media is distributed about people\u2019s health behavior, content analysis and small-scale qualitative research are critical. Before exploring this stage, our study sought to understand vaccination behavior from the viewpoint of population-based behavioral medicine.",

In a small country with outstanding media environment including South Korea, it is difficult to understand ultimate health results from the selection of communication channels. This is because most individuals simultaneously watch diverse media channels and receive large volumes of information. Consequently, this study focused on desirable health behavior (e.g., vaccine uptake) and analyzed characteristics of groups that did not adopt such behavior. Vaccination compliance was generally low among groups with low socio-economic status, and we hypothesized that the issue of an information gap mediated between the two factors. This study was conducted to validate the existence of communication inequality as the strong link between social inequality and health inequality and to identify ways of increasing health equity through the mediating effect of communication inequality.",

Consequently, caution must be exercised in establishing causal relationships among respondents\u2019 vaccination status, media use, and HISB. Findings must be supplemented with longitudinal data. Second, this study did not ask specifically from which types of media respondents acquired health-related information and what type of health-related information was acquired. However, it is difficult to acquire such information from a study design and combine them in a model. Third, vaccination rate was highest among those age 60 and older. In Korea, the elderly (older than age 65) are vaccinated at no cost annually. The possibility that no-cost vaccines contribute to the vaccination rate cannot be dismissed. However, in previous studies that excluded subjects receiving no-cost vaccinations, the older the age, the higher the vaccination rate. As age progresses, the need for vaccination increases and the vaccination rate also increases. Fourth, the explanatory power of this model is somewhat low (16.1%) because other complex factors additionally influenced respondents\u2019 seasonal flu vaccination, that was the dependent variable. In social science, the explained variance of regression models is judged to be outstanding if it totals 20-30%. However, this study constructed the optimal model from the perspective of behavioral medicine and results of regression diagnosis did not exhibit non-systematic residuals separately.",

Reducing the information gap among social classes through a healthy media environment is a way of achieving health equity. Findings of this study will enable development of PHEP strategies by mitigating communication inequality. This study has practical implications for implementation of vaccination campaigns that use effective, timely health communication. To increase the population\u2019s vaccination rate, it is critical to ensure appropriate use of radio and print newspapers. Health-related information should be provided to patients by public health personnel at medical agencies in a more accurate and accessible manner. It is imperative that responsible media representatives strengthen the population\u2019s health information-seeking access through viable, diverse media channels. As the population\u2019s growing fear of epidemics has become a common phenomenon, elucidating social determinants of preventative behavior such as vaccination is a critical task for public health workers.
