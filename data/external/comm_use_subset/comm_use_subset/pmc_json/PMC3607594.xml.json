However, it was not until the past two decades that the inflammatory microenvironment has been recognized as a key component in carcinogenesis, being involved in cancer initiation, promotion and metastasis [1]. Chronic infections are established etiological factors for many human cancers [2]. Similarly, chronic inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease and chronic hepatitis increases the risk for colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas, respectively. In most cases, immune-surveillance is thought to eliminate tumorigenic foci [3]. However, cancer-initiating cells reprogram immune cells to create a tumor-friendly microenvironment, thereby evading antitumor immunity. In addition, cancer can educate both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system through myeloid-derived suppressor cells [4], regulatory T cells [5] and other mediators, to promote growth and invasion.",

Beyond initiation, cytokines activate pro-tumorigenic transcription factors such as STAT3 and NF-\u03baB in existing cancer cells [8]. Inflammatory cells also dampen antitumor immunity through molecules such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase and arginase 1, which interfere with the function of T lymphocytes [4]. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is also favored by cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2, promoting distal metastasis [9].",

However, despite this elaborate cross-talk between cancer cells and the inflammatory microenvironment, the approach to uncover critical players in this interaction has so far been sporadic and non-comprehensive. In this study, we hypothesize that a common inflammatory pattern exists among different cancer types, constituting a signature profile termed as iCAMP. We performed a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across 7 common epithelial cancer types. A robust oncoinflammatory profile was identified, demonstrating independent and strong predictive values in clinical outcomes of multiple cancers. This approach has also led to the discovery and validation of KPNA2 as the single most consistently up-regulated protein in cancer.",

After excluding 10 adenoma samples in the colon dataset, 545 samples were studied, of which 324 were from cancer tissue and 221 were normal. The expression values of the replicate samples in the pancreatic cancer dataset were averaged. The raw datasets were pre-processed individually. For each dataset, gene expression values were adjusted and normalized by the GCRMA approach implemented in R [18]. The false discovery rate (FDR) of each gene on each normalized dataset was calculated using permutation method implemented by the \u201cRankProd\u201d package in R [19]. Each gene in each dataset was then associated with a raw FDR,  for being up/down-regulated [17]. For genes not present in the platform of a dataset, the median FDR value of that dataset was assigned [17].",

The number of genes being up-regulated, down-regulated, and non-differentially expressed for each dataset was estimated by a Beta mixture model implemented in WinBUGS [20]. Based on this rate and using independent Bernoulli distributions, we calculated the likelihood of a gene to be falsely identified as over/under-expressed among the seven datasets for each FDR threshold l. The procedure was evaluated by estimating the false discovery rate (FDRg) observing the above expected log likelihood, i.e. the proportion of false positives among the genes identified to be consistently differentially expressed. The \u201cnull log likelihood\u201d was computed by permuting the values relative to the genes within each dataset, and then performing the same above procedures to calculate the expected value of the \u201cnull log likelihood\u201d in each permutation b for every gene, using  as a cutoff.",

Staining showed absolute specificity to the nucleus without discernible off-target signal. KPNA2 quantification was performed by a surgical pathologist (S.S.) who was blinded to the patient's clinical parameters.

Each dataset corresponds to one cancer type: breast, colon, lung, oral, pancreatic, prostate and gastric cancers. These datasets include expression microarray profiles from cancer tissues and corresponding normal tissues. After determining dysregulated genes in each cancer type, the Consistent Differential Expression Pattern (CDEP) methodology was implemented to identify differentially expressed genes across the seven datasets. 911 genes were up-regulated and 618 genes were down-regulated. Using DAVID, these genes were then functionally classified and the immune-related genes were identified (Figure S2, Table S2). To further improve the signal-to-noise ratio, genes which showed a fold change (FC) <2 in five or more cancer types were excluded. This resulted in a robust inflammatory profile, termed iCAMP, of 44 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated genes at the mRNA level (Figure 1). The protein expression of iCAMP was verified by IHC in 6 cancer types: breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate and gastric by mining the Human Protein Atlas (Table S3, Figure S5). The clinical significance of iCAMP was determined by using Oncomine database. Finally, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool was used to pinpoint the function of iCAMP in cancer-associated inflammation.",

Using IHC as a filtering step would expand the false negative observations, limiting the power of this study. However, it was informative to define which genes showed protein changes in what cancer types as this has direct implications on the choice of genes for further functional analyses. For example, KPNA2 was found to be increased in all cancer types except pancreatic cancer (Figure 2). On the other hand, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), a protein involved in the trans-epithelial transport of immunoglobulins, is consistently down-regulated in cancer cells (Figure 2). Altogether, protein expression data is available for 34 up-regulated and 38 down-regulated genes (total  = 72) of the 96 genes (Table S3, Figure S5). Of the 34 up-regulated genes at the mRNA level, 13 were also up-regulated by IHC in at least 3 of 6 cancer types studied.

First, most of ovarian malignancies are of epithelial origin which is histologically similar to the seven cancer types from which the gene profile was defined. Second, ovarian cancer was not used to generate the iCAMP genes. The predictive value of these genes in ovarian cancer would validate the utility of our gene discovery approach. As a control, the clinical predictive values of these genes were also examined in colon cancer. To determine the direction of dysregulation of each gene in ovarian cancer, we mined 5 published datasets [30], [31], [32], [33], [34] and one additional dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Table S4), which collectively contain 35 normal and 878 cancer samples. Based on the number of datasets showing dysregulation in each direction, each gene was labeled as elevated, unchanged or repressed in ovarian cancer (Figure 1). A gene is determined to be elevated if 1) at least 1 dataset shows up-regulation (p<0.05) and none of the other datasets shows down-regulation, or 2) at least 3 datasets show up-regulation and not more than one dataset shows down-regulation (p<0.05). The inverse applies to repressed genes. Based on that, 33 of the 44 up-regulated genes were also elevated in ovarian cancer, 3 were repressed and 8 could not be determined. Among the 52 down-regulated genes, 28 were also repressed in ovarian cancer, 7 were unchanged, 10 were elevated and 7 were undetermined (Figure 1). Thus, at least 61 out of 96 iCAMP genes were concordantly dysregulated in ovarian cancer.",

This score takes into consideration the number of genes within which the patient falls in the high risk group, as well as the risk each of these genes confers. The robustness of IGIS was validated using the independent ovarian cancer TCGA dataset. Based on cutoff values pre-determined from the initial training dataset above [22], stage IIIC patients from the TCGA dataset were categorized as either high or low risk for each gene. Then, for each gene where a TCGA patient shows poor prognosis, relative risk (RR pre-determined by the training dataset) of that gene was added to the patients IGIS score. The TCGA patients eventually were distributed with different IGIS scores based on expression levels of all 18 IGIS genes.

Recently, transcriptional profiling of blood from colorectal patients and normal controls by qRT-PCR identified TNFAIP6 as a biomarker for colorectal cancer [43]. This study shows that TNFAIP6 mRNA is elevated in peripheral blood cells of colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigated the protein levels of TNFAIP6 in colon cancer cells and adjacent normal epithelium. Immunohistochemical staining of 55 colon cancer specimens and 50 adjacent normal tissues revealed an increased expression in cancer on a per cell basis, as well as an increase in the frequency of TNFAIP6-expressing cells (Figures 9A, B and C). TNFAIP6 protein levels did not predict overall patient survival (data not shown).

Although the biological significance of our finding awaits further studies, it is clear that the iCAMP not only exists but also shows significant clinical relevance. The core iCAMP gene set reproduces many well-established genes that are aberrantly expressed in cancer tissue, such as VCAN and KPNA2. It also uncovers a number of new consistently dysregulated genes that have not been studied in the context of anti-cancer immunity, such as BST2, LEAP2, TNFAIP6, TNFSF4 and KPNA2 (Table 1).",

Importantly, not all up/down-regulated genes contribute to the invasiveness of the cancers studied. The tumor microenvironment consists of a complex interaction among cancer, stromal, endothelial, and immune cells. Any given change in gene expression could be an active process initiated by cancer cells and eventually promote invasiveness, or alternatively, be a reaction by other cells of the immune system. This is best illustrated by some up-regulated genes whose elevation predicts better prognosis, and down-regulated genes whose repression correlates with longer survival.",

            "text": "Among the genes that drew our attention was KPNA2, which was increased in expression in 6 of 7 cancer types at the mRNA and the protein levels, with limited expression in normal epithelia. KPNA2 is an embryonic antigen, shown to be expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells [52] and normal human testis [53], [54], and emerges again in a variety of epithelial [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [55], [56] and non-epithelial [57], [58] cancers. Despite the exceptional correlation of this gene with cancer behavior across multiple cancer types, its function in shaping tumor behavior remains unclear. One study showed KPNA2 to promote invasive phenotypes of human breast cancer cells in vitro\n[59], but the mechanism underlying this observation was not investigated. In a cell-free system, KPNA2 was reported to interact with OCT4, a transcription factor involved in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells [54]. Could KPNA2 expression lead to a significant activity in cancer cells to produce oncogenic inflammatory mediators? This is possible, particularly since KPNA2 does not seem to be a general nuclear importer. The selective transport of some key immunologically important transcription factors such as STAT1 and IRF1 by KPNA2 raises a strong possibility of underlying immunological properties of KPNA2. Thus, the potential dual roles of KPNA2 to regulate inflammation as well as stemness of cells suggests that it could serve as a critical link between chronic inflammation and oncogenesis. This speculation warrants further studies.",
