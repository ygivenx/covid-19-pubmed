Further, S. suis 2 can also be transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected swine, causing meningitis, permanent hearing loss, septic shock and even death (Gottschalk et al., 2007). Due to its high incidence, transmissibility, persistence in the environment and its ability to occur in explosive epidemic form, S. suis 2 continues to be a global public health concern. After two extensive human outbreaks of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) caused by S. suis 2 in China in 1998 and 2005 (Tang et al., 2006), S. suis 2 has been recognized as a re-emerging zoonotic pathogen and was found to characteristically harbour a candidate pathogenicity island (PAI) designated 89K (Chen et al., 2007). Recent genetic evidence showing that a two-component system (SalK/R) encoded within this island mediates a piglet-lethal phenotype has strengthened the case that 89K is a PAI (Li et al., 2008).",

These architectural features strongly suggest that it may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Meanwhile, the internal modular organization of 89K indicates that it was generated by multiple recombination events because it carries several unrelated gene blocks found in widely divergent species, making it difficult to ascertain its initial origin. A better understanding of the molecular biology of 89K will undoubtedly provide important insight into the emergence, virulence, and evolution of this important pathogen. Indeed, it may reveal some clues concerning the molecular pathogenesis of STSS caused by S. suis 2.",

Based on the organization of genetic determinants, shared homologies and evolutionary relationships, T4SSs can be classified into three major types: (i) type IVA systems resemble the archetypal VirB/VirD4 system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and are considered to be the paradigm of T4SS; (ii) type IVB systems resemble the Dot/Icm system found in Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii; and (iii) other T4SSs bear little or no homology to Type IVA or IVB systems, and their functions await further investigation. Representative of the third group are the recently described genomic island (GI)-type T4SSs that are found in a broad spectrum of Gram-negative pathogens (Juhas et al., 2008). Ultimately, it is the identification of the GI-type T4SSs that brings insight into the mechanisms by which GIs transfer between bacteria (Juhas et al., 2009).",

We provide genetic evidence showing that an 89K-borne integrase mediates site-specific excision and circularization of 89K, with contribution from an auxiliary protein named excisionase. The 89K extrachromosomal circular excision product is self-transmissible and can conjugally transfer via a plasmid-like process into S. suis recipient cells through the 89K-encoded GI-type T4SS transport conduit. Thus far, while mobilization of genetic elements by T4SSs has been well studied in Gram-negative bacteria, the transfer of Gram-positive mobile genetic elements by T4SSs is currently limited to conjugative plasmids and transposons. Without a previous comprehensive study, we present the first demonstration of the horizontal transfer of a PAI mediated by a GI-type T4SS in a Gram-positive bacterium. We suggest that this new mobile element is responsible, at least in part, for the recent STSS outbreaks in China and recent sporadic cases in neighbouring countries and areas including Vietnam and Thailand (Holden et al., 2009), and it will possibly spread further in the future.",

To determine whether the 89K PAI is transmissible from a donor S. suis strain containing 89K to a recipient strain without this element, we performed conjugative mating experiments. To obtain a marked version of 89K, a 3\u2032 single cross-over mutant of strain 05ZYH33 constructed in our previous work was used as the donor, which was tagged with a spectinomycin marker located downstream of the SalK/R two-component system within 89K (Li et al., 2008). We designated this derivative 05ZYH33-89KSpc and the modified 89K island as 89K*. SS2-N, a virulent strain of S. suis 2 that does not naturally contain 89K, was engineered to be chloramphenicol-resistant by replacing the recA gene with a cat gene cassette (creating SS2-N\u0394recA) and used as the recipient. Medium containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin was used to select exconjugants that received 89K*. In the filter mating assay, double antibiotic-resistant transconjugants were obtained, and transfer of 89K* was detected at a mean frequency of 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 per donor (Table 1). Using specific primers, the integrated 89K* was detected in 10 randomly selected transconjugants, providing further evidence that 89K* was transferred into the recipients. Transfer of 89K* was also observed at a similar frequency by using other S. suis 2 strains as recipients, including the virulent S735 strain and the avirulent 7996 strain, both isolated from the Netherlands (Table 1). However, conjugation experiments using other serotypes of S. suis (serotypes 7 and 9) and other streptococcal species (S. sanguinis and S. agalactiae) as recipients were performed but without success, suggesting that the 89K transfer may be species- and serotype-specific.",

Based on our previously reported comparative sequence analysis, 89K is located in the genome of S. suis strain 05ZYH33 at a position between 05SSU0902 (hyd) and 05SSU0983 (rplL), which encode a predicted hydrolase and the 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 respectively (Chen et al., 2007). A total of 80 open reading frames (ORFs) were annotated in the 89K island, most of them (n = 65) on the minus strand. The overall gene organization in 89K is presented in Fig. 1. Notably, 89K contains a Tn916 element, which is likely associated with the tetracycline resistance phenotype because the S. suis 2 reference P1/7 strain without 89K is sensitive to tetracycline. Furthermore, 89K carries a large lantibiotic biosynthesis cluster, which was suggested to be incapable of producing a functional lantibiotic (due to mutation) but essential for full virulence (Phelps and Neely, 2007; Holden et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Due to the aberrant GC content of 89K and its absence in the reference P1/7 strain and a number of international virulent strains, it appears that 05ZYH33 acquired the 89K PAI horizontally. 89K then integrated into the chromosome at the attB site in the rplL gene, generating two direct repeats (attL and attR) at both ends of the island. It is well documented that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are able to excise from the chromosomes to form circular intermediates prior to conjugative transfer into recipient cells (Burrus et al., 2002). We confirmed that 89K did excise from the 05ZYH33 chromosome to produce a circular form and the host genome was repaired upon excision because PCR products were obtained for both primer pairs P2/P3 and P1/P4 (Fig. 2B). Subsequent sequence analysis confirmed the expected structures of attP and attB generated upon site-specific excision (Fig. 2C and D). Noticeably, the amplicons obtained with primer pairs P2/P3 and P1/P4 showed a substantially weaker signal compared to that with P1/P2 and P3/P4, indicating that 89K excision is a rare event. To measure the rate of 89K excision, we developed a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay and determined that the frequency of 89K excision from an 05ZYH33 overnight culture was \u223c0.032%, a rate similar to that observed for SLG excision from the Streptomyces lividans 66 chromosome (He et al., 2007). These data demonstrated that 89K can spontaneously excise from the chromosome and form a circular excision product. Detection of both integrated and circular 89K suggests that the populations of 05ZYH33 carrying this island are heterogeneous. Most cells carry an integrated island, while others contain an extrachromosomal circular one. Essentially, the same results were obtained for 98HAH12, another highly pathogenic S. suis 2 strain, which is predominantly responsible for the earlier 1998 STSS outbreak in China (data not shown).",

            "text": "A common feature of PAIs is the presence of a site-specific recombinase that is presumably responsible for the integration of the PAI into the bacterial chromosome (Mantri and Williams, 2004). The 89K int gene, located near the left end of the island (attL) at a distance of 63 bp, encodes a 403-amino-acid (aa) integrase belonging to the tyrosine recombinase family, which catalyses site-specific recombination between a chromosomal site (attB) and a similar or identical sequence (attP) found on mobile genetic elements including bacteriophages, insertion sequences and transposons (Esposito and Scocca, 1997; Nunes-Duby et al., 1998). Functional studies of related members of this family give good reason to assume that 89K excision is mediated by the 89K-borne integrase. To determine if this is the case, we generated an isogenic int knockout mutant of strain 05ZYH33 (creating 05ZYH33\u0394int) and examined 89K excision in this mutant. PCR products were generated using primer pairs P1/P5 (primer P5 is located upstream of xis, as the int deletion removes the priming site for P2) and P3/P4. However, negative results were obtained with primer pairs P3/P5 and P1/P4 (Fig. 3B). qPCR analysis of the \u0394int mutant also demonstrated that 89K excision was eliminated, with attP not being detected. Trans-complementation of int restored the excision capacity of 89K to a level comparable to that of the parental strain, with attP being present in \u223c0.025% of cells. These results suggest that deletion of int in strain 05ZYH33 abolished the ability of 89K to excise from the host chromosome. Thus, Int is essential for 89K excision and circularization by mediating site-specific recombination between the attL and attR sites.",

In our analysis, a small ORF (05SSU0904), located immediately upstream of the int gene and separated by a 14 bp intergenic region, was found to encode a possible Xis homologue with 32% aa identity to a putative excisionase (accession number AAL27447.1) from Enterococcus faecalis (Fig. 3A). The predicted xis is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (AGGAG), which is located 8 bp upstream from the initiation codon of xis. Further sequence analysis revealed a palindrome of 27 bp with the potential to form a stem-loop structure situated 85 bp downstream from the stop codon of int, which may function as a transcriptional terminator. The genetic organization of this locus suggests possible translational coupling between xis and int.",

Conjugation can proceed only after the formation of a protein-DNA complex (relaxosome) at the oriT site, which is often located in the intergenic region upstream of its cognate relaxase gene (Francia et al., 2004). The oriT of the 89K PAI was predicted to be a sequence of \u223c40 nt positioned within the 05SSU0915 coding sequence, which is predicted to encode a polypeptide of unknown function with 62% aa identity to a hypothetical protein (SMSK597-1197, accession number ZP_07642092.1) of S. mitis SK597. This segment contains a perfect 9 nt inverted repeat sequence (predicted by the DNA Strider program) that may be necessary to form a stable nucleoprotein complex during conjugation (Bhattacharjee and Meyer, 1993). The precise nic (nickase cleavage) site was predicted to reside at position 3\u2032-(887140)CTCG/CAAA(887147) on the negative strand, which is located 8 nt downstream of the inverted repeats within the oriT region based on an extensive sequence alignment with other oriT sites that have been experimentally determined previously. Figure 4 shows the overall gene organization of the DNA processing region of 89K. We noticed that MobA89K has an N-terminal relaxase domain but lacks a C-terminal helicase domain, which usually possesses a processive 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 unwinding activity that provides the motive force for strand transfer (Llosa et al., 1996; Matson et al., 2001). Instead, we found that ORF 05SSU0934 within 89K encodes a match to the DNA helicase (accession number ACF56805.1) of S. pneumoniae G54, with 93% aa identity. In vivo mutational analysis demonstrated that this gene (designated hlc, helicase) is not required for 89K excision and circularization (Fig. 3B) but is essential for 89K transfer (Table 1).",

The recombinant plasmid (pVA838-oriT) was found to be able to transfer at a frequency of about 6.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 transconjugants per donor, which is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than that of 89K*.

These results demonstrated that the non-conjugative plasmid pVA838 could be mobilized only by 05ZYH33 carrying an active relaxase after introducing a fragment encompassing the putative 89K oriT. In other words, the 89K PAI has a functional oriT site recognized by its cognate relaxase, MobA89K.",

The supercoiled oriT-containing plasmid pMD-oriT was used as substrate DNA in an in vitro cleavage reaction.

The oriT-containing plasmid pMD-oriT was linearized with a restriction endonuclease (ScaI or NdeI) and then co-incubated with the protein components of interest. The predicted oriT nick on each of these specifically linearized fragments is shown in Fig. 5C. As expected, three distinct bands corresponding to the predicted sizes (based on nicking at the predicted oriT site) were detected on an alkaline agarose gel, in which the dsDNAs were denatured into single strands (Fig. 5D). The C-terminally truncated MobA89K protein showed a comparable nicking activity to that of the full-length protein. In all cases, the largest fragment corresponded to the full-length plasmid ssDNA, and the different sizes of the two additional bands with higher mobility indicated site-specific cleavage of one of the plasmid strands. Indeed, the sum of the sizes of these two fragments equals one full-length linear ssDNA plasmid. These results, together with the supercoiled plasmid DNA cleavage data described above, demonstrated that the in vitro nicking reaction was dependent on the presence of both MobA89K and MobC89K, and the MobA89K-dependent oriT nicking activity resides within the N-terminal 258-aa relaxase domain of MobA89K.",

            "text": "Integrase-mediated precise excision of mobile elements from the chromosome typically represents the first step in the lateral transfer process. Such excision events usually lead to the formation of circular episomal products that are intermediates in the packaging of some ICEs (e.g. P4) into phage particles (Bowden and Modrich, 1985), or serve as substrates for conjugative transfer of other elements, such as PAPI-1 (Qiu et al., 2006) and SXT (Burrus and Waldor, 2003). Sequence analysis revealed that 89K is not similar to an integrated prophage, suggesting that the excised circular 89K may undergo lateral transfer. Confirmation of this hypothesis was obtained by the observation that transfer of a SpcR-marked 89K occurred at a frequency of approximately 10\u22126 per donor, similar to that of the Pseudomonas clc element (Sentchilo et al., 2003) and the Salmonella SGI1 island (Doublet et al., 2005). Further, 89K transfer absolutely requires the 89K-borne integrase, while a \u0394xis derivative can still transfer at a low but measurable frequency. This suggests that 89K excision is required for its transfer, and Xis may exert its effect by reducing the number of copies of excised circularized 89K molecules. Notably, Gilmore and co-workers demonstrated that transfer of the enterococcal PAI did not require the PAI-resident integrase, excisionase or putative conjugation genes. Instead, transfer only occurred from donors possessing a pheromone responsive-type of conjugative plasmid via an Hfr-like and RecA-dependent mechanism (Manson et al., 2010). Chromosomal transfer mediated by this kind of Hfr-like mechanism was regarded as the major evolutionary force driving the genome dynamics of S. agalactiae (Brochet et al., 2008).",

Throughout the past half century, investigations of T4SSs have largely focused on defining the mechanisms of action of several model systems of Gram-negative bacteria, such as the F (IncF), R388 (IncW), RP4 (IncP) and pKM101 (IncN) plasmid conjugation systems and the A. tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 system. However, little is known about the architectures or mechanisms of T4SSs in Gram-positives (Alvarez-Martinez and Christie, 2009). Although T4SS-mediated mobilization of genetic elements has been characterized in some species of Gram-positive bacteria, such elements are currently limited to conjugative plasmids (e.g. E. faecalis pCF10, S. agalactiae pIP501 and C. perfringens pCW3) and transposons (e.g. E. faecalis Tn916, B. subtilis ICEBs1 and S. agalactiae TnGBS2). Indeed, transfer of Gram-positive GIs (especially PAIs) by T4SSs has not yet been reported. Our findings expand the repertoire of Gram-positive ICEs that can be mobilized by T4SS, and this is the first characterization of horizontal transfer of a Gram-positive PAI by a GI-type T4SS. In contrast, GI-type T4SSs have been identified in various Gram-negative GIs such as pKLC102, PAPI-1, SPI-7 and the Pseudomonas clc element, as well as others derived from a wide variety of Gram-negative plant and animal pathogens, including Erwinia carotovora (Chen et al., 2008), Xylella fastidiosa (Zaini et al., 2008), Photorhabdus luminescens (Held et al., 2007) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Collyn et al., 2006). The complete set of 24 genes thought to encode the putative GI-type T4SS in H. influenzae ICEHin1056 has been fully or largely identified in the GIs of the above-mentioned Gram-negative pathogens, suggesting that GI-type T4SSs are highly conserved among these species (Juhas et al., 2008). Comparative genomic and functional analysis suggested that 89K encodes a GI-type T4SS at its 5\u2032 terminus (05SSU0961-05SSU0982), differing in gene content and organization with the Gram-negative counterparts (Fig. S2). This indicates that there may be an evolutionary divergence of GI-type T4SSs between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, perhaps due to the differences in cell wall structure.",

In a small proportion of host bacteria, the 89K-borne integrase mediates precise excision of 89K from the chromosome with the help of an excisionase. Upon detection of a mating signal, the transfer of the excised circular intermediate of 89K begins (Llosa et al., 2002). In the first step, MobA89K initiates the processing reaction by generating a strand- and site-specific nick at the oriT site of 89K, with help from the auxiliary MobC89K protein. Next, the 05SSU0934 DNA helicase unwinds the nicked strand during relaxosome formation, and the VirD4-89K coupling protein then links the relaxosome and leads it directly to the mating channel (Llosa et al., 2003). The VirB1-89K lytic transglycosylase, for which peptidoglycan cleavage activity has been previously demonstrated in A. tumefaciens (Zupan et al., 2007), should play a crucial role in local opening of the peptidoglycan during the assembly of the transenvelope transporter complex. However, it should be noted that some other factor(s) (e.g. muramidase) may also be implicated in the formation of the transmembrane pore because inactivation of virB1-89K did not completely abolish the conjugal transfer capacity of 89K. VirB6-89K is a highly hydrophobic protein containing six predicted transmembrane segments and is the best candidate for a channel-forming protein in A. tumefaciens (Christie, 1997). Adjacent genes encoding peptides (e.g. 05SSU0970, 05SSU0972 and 05SSU0975) harbouring transmembrane domains may also contribute to the construction of the transport apparatus. After the conjugation machinery is manufactured, the VirB4-89K ATPase would work as an alternative translocation energy supplier, aside from VirD4-89K, to motor the DNA substrate through the mating channel and drive export as in A. tumefaciens (Dang et al., 1999).",

We previously reported that three re-emerging S. suis 2 strains in China in 2007 all share the 89K PAI, and two of them had undergone gene losses/deletions (Feng et al., 2009). Further, using Roche NimbleGen microarray technology and PCR analysis, we found that several virulent (e.g. 606, 1941 and 8011) and avirulent (e.g. T15 and 2f) S. suis 2 strains carry only a portion of this island (unpublished data). The 89K element was also found to be partially included in strain 7996, one of the recipient strains used in our transfer experiments, albeit at a different location. Recently, published work suggests that S. suis strain BM407, which was isolated from a human meningitis case in Vietnam in 2004, contains two regions with extended similarity to 89K (Holden et al., 2009). Structural and compositional analysis strongly suggests that both of these regions have the potential to undergo excision and transfer, just as 89K does.",

Understanding horizontal transfer of GIs is essential to elucidate how genome plasticity in S. suis is maintained and how it may contribute to the evolution of infectious diseases. Our work, which demonstrated the horizontal transfer of an important streptococcal PAI, provides an interesting insight into the molecular mechanism of GI transfer and may prove to be exemplary for the study of the evolutionary strategies of other pathogens. A better understanding of the molecular biology of PAIs will both greatly improve our knowledge of bacterial pathogenesis and may lead to new and improved vaccines, novel therapeutics and better environmental monitoring of epidemic strains.",

After receiving a mating signal, the transfer initiates with the oriT nicking reaction catalysed by the MobA89K and MobC89K proteins. The cleaved strand is then unwound by the helicase and delivered to the 89K-encoded GI-type T4SS machinery. The VirB1-89K component is thought to act as a lytic transglycosylase, locally opening the peptidoglycan with contributions from some other factor(s) during the assembly of the transport channel. VirD4-89K is a coupling protein required to deliver the DNA substrate to the transport channel, and together with VirB4-89K, required to energize the substrate transport across the channel. The highly hydrophobic VirB6-89K homologue constitutes the main portion of the transport channel.",
