            "text": "My time as a Board Member of the International Association of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (IAACI) began in 1989 during the Presidency of Dr Jacques Charpin. Some of the members at that time were Drs S. Gunnar O. Johansson, Alain deWeck, Jack Pepys, Oscar Frick, Albert Oehling, and Michael Kaliner. Its functioning bore little resemblance to the World Allergy Organization (WAO) we all know today, but this was its predecessor, and the organization dates back to 1951. Its origins were primarily European, but the addition of Drs Terumasa Miyamoto from Japan, Jos\u00e9 Huerta Lopez of M\u00e9xico, Leonardo Grieding of Argentina, Julio Croce of Brazil, and Michael Kaliner and myself from the United States, represented the start of a more global distribution of the leadership. Before that time, Dr. Fred Wittich (1981-1984) and Dr. Carl Arbesman (1979-1982) were the only Presidents originating from the US.",

This was, in fact, the main task of the Board of Directors because the broad programmatic portfolio we associate with WAO had not yet begun. I was asked to hold the position of Secretary-General in 1992, and although we always had a Treasurer, I signed off on checks for the organization until 2006, when Dr Richard F. Lockey became Treasurer, because it was convenient to have the signatory be someone from the US, given the location of the business headquarters in Milwaukee. It is interesting to note that I have no idea what prompted my choice as Secretary-General or how it transpired. We did not have a formal constitution, there were no elections, and I was not yet a member of the \"inner sanctum\" responsible for those kinds of decisions.",

It was called Allergy and Clinical Immunology News, and was something of a hybrid between a bona fide journal and a magazine. I was appointed an Associate Editor and joined Drs Jean Bousquet and Michael Kaliner. Most of the articles were reviews, but there were some original reports. It had interviews and information about allergology in various parts of the world. It was easy to read, included an occasional cartoon, and was colorful. Dr deWeck remained as Editor-in-Chief for 10 years, and I was an Associate Editor for much of that time. Contributions came from all over the world; thus, it served as a vehicle by which allergists from remote regions, where our specialty was not yet well developed, could participate in something that would unite peoples and we could all meet in-person at the tri-annual Congress.",

We changed the name of the journal to Allergy and Clinical Immunology International, but it remained essentially the same, and Drs Kaliner, G. Walter Canonica, and Charles Naspitz served as Associate Editors. However, the number of submissions rose, the number of pages allotted to each issue increased, and most importantly, the number of allergolgists receiving it worldwide increased substantially reaching a peak readership of close to 20,000. It was funded primarily by IAACI itself (and WAO later on), and with the assistance of Dr Ruby Pawankar grants were obtained from UCB, Japan and Taiho Pharmaceuticals. Costs rose as the years passed, and funding became increasingly problematic because the number of individual paid subscriptions covered only a minor portion of the actual cost and we were dependent on our own funds and whatever external support we could get. Once the new name, the WAO became firmly established, the name of the journal was changed once again to the The Journal of the World Allergy Organization. I was succeeded as Editor-in-Chief by Dr Johannes Ring.",

These included a consortium of representatives from Russia, the Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kirgizstan, all under the leadership of Dr Revaz Sepiashvili. The costs for the translation, printing, and distribution were contributed equally by WAO, the CIS Society of Immunology and Allergy, and Dr Lawrence DuBuske's \"IRINE\" Foundation. Nevertheless, it was decided that WAO should own its journal, and a new online journal was conceived, led by Drs Johannes Ring and Lanny Rosenwasser. Dr Rosenwasser is the current Editor-in-Chief.",

Mr Rick Iber, representing the central office, spearheaded the effort. The vision was to create a society with worldwide representation that was actively involved in education at all levels, supported research where possible, provided assistance to nations trying to develop the specialty of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and created a communications network with member nations, regional members, and if possible, individual members. We organized councils to oversee each area and committees within each council to carry out the various projects. The name of this organization was changed, employing \"The World Allergy Organization/IAACI\" for a few years; and then we dropped \"IAACI\" from the name, but not without some consternation on the part of the membership. There was concern that we would lose the emphasis on Clinical Immunology, but we felt that a less cumbersome and more \"catchy\" name was needed with \"WAO\" as the abbreviation. Names notwithstanding, the organization has grown and matured over the years beyond any of our expectations.",

Among the requests were pollen traps for both regions; and for the CIS, translating our journal into Russian. We were joined by the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) in the ESP endeavor.

A series of slides were produced by WAO, and the lectures were offered to member nations on a competitive basis. An application was required; applicants were ranked and accepted to the degree that funds were available. A WAO member would be sent, all expenses paid, so that the person functioned as a visiting professor and could be integrated into whatever national program was scheduled at the time. By the time I left the WAO Board of Directors, about 15 different lectures were available.",

Drs Simons and Kaliner and I conferred by phone on a monthly basis, initially, and then weekly as the meeting date approached. I could not have had more dedicated, efficient, associates to organize this event, and the Secretariat staff members were, as always, critical to its success. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus hit at about the time of the meeting, particularly in the Toronto area, and may have limited attendance; but we were delighted with the turnout, and the feedback regarding the scientific program and social events was extremely laudatory. We had overestimated hotel rooms needed and did not fill as many as anticipated; however, negotiations between the Secretariat and the hotel managements involved led to a financial compromise such that the meeting was also a financial success.",

We had a band and dancing, and I decided to have some fun and participate in the entertainment. In fact, it was rumored among the WAO Board that I had some musical happening planned, but they had no idea what that might be. They did assume that I played some instrument, and a consensus emerged that I was likely to play either the flute or the violin.",

The father of our tympanist was a professional percussionist who was a friend of Lionel Hampton, and Mr Hampton agreed to my having an audition with him, with a view toward my development as a professional jazz drummer. However, one requirement was that I devote full-time to it, that is, give up aspirations of a career in medicine. That did not happen, and after not playing for 40 years, my son gave me a surprise birthday present, 10 lessons with Quentin Baxter who is one of the USAs leading jazz drummers who happens to live in Charleston. I had just begun taking lessons during my presidency, and at the dinner, during the band's break between courses, I arranged to play a drum \"solo\" with the band's drummer keeping a background beat to complement mine. I cannot know how it really sounded, but the audience response was great; after they recovered from the shock.",

So, my 18-year experience with WAO was unexpected, my ascending to Secretary-General and then President seems like very good luck with the stars aligned just right, and I can honestly say that the opportunity to meet people with like interests from all over the world and to do something helpful for our specialty with worldwide ramifications, is one of the most satisfying things I have ever attempted. The WAO Board members have been a unique, heterogeneous, talented group of physicians to whom I have been indebted for many years because nothing happens without their approval. Many friendships were made along the way that would never otherwise have occurred. The changes from 1998 to 2006 were profound but not formulized until a new constitution was developed under the leadership of Dr Richard Lockey. Standing Committees were added apart from those included within the council structure. The position(s) of Vice-President was abolished, and a mechanism for election of Board Members, Executive Committee members, and the President were established. Democracy arrived; the \"old boys\" network ended, but there is no progress without loss, and elections mean that there are \"losers.\" It is also a group deception to think that the backroom choices were less effective than the electoral choices, or that popularity contests, and favors cannot also enter into voting. Nothing is perfect.",

I would like to close with a special thanks to 2 persons; Dr Michael Kaliner and Ms Kay Whalen. Dr Kaliner and I began our Allergy Fellowship together in 1970; we worked together at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), overlapped on the AAAAI Board, worked together for WAO during my entire tenure, and have been friends for 40 years. I would probably not have written this had he not asked me to do so. Ms Whalen and I spent 10 years together working for AAAAI and 18 years for WAO. She is understated, sometimes taken for granted, is ever-present, and 28 years of unequivocal support is a long time. I cannot thank her enough.",
