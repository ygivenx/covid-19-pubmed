Cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) respond to cytosolic bacterial products and contribute to the induction of the innate immune response [5], [6]. Previous studies in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and epithelial cells show that in these cell types the synthesis of IFN-I in response to infection with L. monocytogenes is independent of TLRs and their adapters, relying exclusively on signals originating from cytosolic sensors [5]\u2013[8]. DNA as well as cyclic dinucleotides released from lysed bacteria were suggested to function as the relevant L. monocytogenes PAMPs [9]\u2013[11]. Several cytosolic proteins with the ability to sense pathogen-derived nucleic acids have recently been described [11]\u2013[19]. Cytosolic recognition of L. monocytogenes causes the activation of the serine/threonine kinase TBK1 and the phosphorylation of its substrate transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 [7], [8]. Both IRF3 and IRF7 participate in the formation of an enhanceosome at the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [20].",

            "text": "In order to establish a successful infection, pathogens must survive host defense systems or else mitigate the activities of PRRs. Consequently, they have evolved to modify the structural components which normally trigger PRR responses. Bacterial PGN is a hetero-polymer consisting of alternating residues of \u03b2-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid to which a peptide chain is attached [24]. Interestingly, L. monocytogenes modifies its PGN, with fifty per cent of the muropeptide composition being N-deacetylated [25]. We previously reported that a PGN N-deacetylase gene, pgdA, is responsible for this modification [25]. PGN deacetylation confers resistance to the action of lysozyme, one of the most important and widespread antimicrobial agents of the innate defense system, thus preventing degradation and release of immunostimulants. A strain of L. monocytogenes mutated in its ability to alter its PGN, \u0394pgdA, is sensitive to lysozyme and induces an enhanced IFN-\u03b2 response in macrophages compared to the isogenic parental strain [25].",

We measured the induction of I\u03baB expression in PEM infected with EGDe or the \u0394pgdA mutant.

These results suggest that TLR2 and TRIF contribute to NF\u03baB activation. The comparison between EGDe and \u0394pgdA strains showed that both caused similar magnitudes of I\u03baB mRNA synthesis.

            "text": "It was surprising to see a role for TLR2, as, based on results in BMM and epithelial cells, type I IFNs production is usually not known to result from TLR2 signaling [5]\u2013[8]. Classical TLR2 signaling leads to NF-\u03baB-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines [21]. However, in support of an unconventional role for TLR2, recent studies reported roles for TLR2-dependent induction of IFN-\u03b2 in response to vaccinia virus or synthetic ligands [26], [29]. In the vaccinia virus study, a specific inflammatory monocyte population -Ly6Chi- was shown to be the source of IFN-\u03b2 [26]. In the present study we show that TLR2-dependent IFN-\u03b2 synthesis is a property of both resident and recruited inflammatory PEM. Furthermore, the two previous studies documented that TLR2 activation of type I IFN responses to TLR ligands occurs within intracellular compartments, and that TLR2 signals from the phagosome in response to viral infection or synthetic TLR2 ligands [26], [29]. These results challenged the view that TLR2 signals solely from the plasma membrane. In our experiments, pre-treatment of PEM with either cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization and thus internalization, dynasore, an inhibitor of the endocytic effector dynamin, or chloroquine, which inhibits endosome acidification [30], [31], significantly impaired the induction of IFN-\u03b2 following Listeria infection, strongly suggesting that phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes and intracellular location of TLR2 trigger this response. These observations also correlate with our early hypothesis that the inflammatory response induced by \u0394pgdA is due to an enhanced release or accessibility of bacterial cell wall components to TLR2.",

            "text": "Induction of the IFN-\u03b2 gene was independent of the TLR adapter Mal/TIRAP, but, unexpectedly required the TLR3/4 adapter TRIF. Francisella tularensis has recently been shown to signal through TLR2 from the phagosome in a Mal/TIRAP independent manner [32], and it was shown that Mal/TIRAP is dispensable in TLR2 signaling at high concentrations of ligands [33]. Thus our study reinforces the view that TLR2 can act independently from Mal/TIRAP. In addition our report suggests a synergy between a TLR2 pathway and TRIF, an adapter previously known to trigger the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs upon engagement of TLR3 and TLR4. TLR3 is known to bind viral dsRNA to induce secretion of type I IFN and lead to control of viral infections [3], [34], [35]. To our knowledge Chlamydia muridarum is the only bacterium reported to induce a TLR3-dependent IFN-\u03b2 response specifically in murine oviduct epithelial cells [36]. We tested whether the dual requirement for TLR2 and TRIF resulted from a functional or physical interaction between TLR2 and TLR3. In fact, IFN-\u03b2 production was reduced in TLR3-deficient macrophages, but significantly less so than in trif\u2212/\u2212 PEM. Therefore, there is no evidence for a putative TLR2/TLR3 interaction. Another possibility to incorporate TRIF into the pathway stimulated in PEM by Listeria would be a cooperation of TLR2 and TLR4. This was ruled out by showing that Listeria-infected tlr4\u2212/\u2212 PEM produced a similar amount of IFN-\u03b2 as their wild-type counterparts. TRIF could possibly orchestrate an additional pathway. Along these lines, TRIF has recently been shown to be required for IFN-\u03b2 synthesis by dendritic cells upon activation of the cytosolic receptor complex DDX1/DDX21/DDX36 by viral RNA [19].",

We addressed the role of these transcriptional activators in the IFN-\u03b2 response to wild-type Listeria and \u0394pgdA, and revealed that inactivation of IRF3 totally abrogated this response to both strains while IFN-\u03b2 induction was significantly but not totally impaired in IRF7-deficient macrophages, indicating that both of these transcription factors are required for induction of IFN-\u03b2 following infection with L. monocytogenes. We also assessed the involvement of NF-\u03baB in this response using induction of the I\u03baB gene as a readout. We observed an induction of I\u03baB expression in macrophages which was similar after infection with EGDe or \u0394pgdA. Thus, activation of NF-\u03baB by Listeria is independent of PgdA, strongly suggesting that the elevated IFN-\u03b2 production by the \u0394pgdA mutant mostly relies on IRF3.",

As recent studies have highlighted novel DNA-sensing pathways in the induction of type I IFNs [9], [14]\u2013[17], [38], we thus also investigated the involvement of bacterial nucleic acids in the IFN-\u03b2 induction, Firstly, we showed that inactivation of PgdA, which confers a higher susceptibility to lysozyme, leads to increased release of DNA. We then showed that DNA from L. monocytogenes can induce IFN-\u03b2 expression in PEM, suggesting that this macrophage population employs cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing similar to macrophages or macrophage lines derived from different anatomical locations [9], [38]. Which -if any- of the recently described nucleic acid sensors are used by PEM for the recognition of Listeria DNA remains subject to future investigation. Nevertheless, other bacterial components could participate in IFN-\u03b2 production upon infection with the \u0394pgdA mutant. For example, the second messenger molecule cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), was shown to be secreted by Listeria multidrug efflux pumps triggering type I IFN response [10] and could be involved in the process.",

In this regard cooperation between TLR2 and TRIF may reflect the need for convergence of the NF-\u03baB and IRF pathways at the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, with TLR2 being responsible mainly for NF-\u03baB activation and TRIF being instrumental for activation of IRF3 and IRF7. By employing the strategy of PGN modification, L. monocytogenes can avoid immune detection by TLR and evade the innate immune response, thus enabling the infectious process to occur. It is important to recall that pgdA orthologs are found in other pathogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis and Helicobacter pylori, strongly suggesting that PGN N-deacetylation is a general mechanism evolved by microbes to escape from pattern recognition receptor-mediated immune recognition [39]\u2013[42].",
