About 10% of patients develop lethal cardiomyopathy, with heart transplantation remaining the ultimate treatment available6. CCC is an inflammatory condition characterized by intense Th1-type immune response7. After initial infection, Th1 proinflammatory cytokines are produced and this production continues along chronic phase, likely due to parasite persistence among others6. Persistent Th1-type response can lead to cardiac commitment, starting with myocarditis and then progressing to CCC8.",

The infective form of T. cruzi, the metacyclic trypomastigotes, can invade almost all nucleated cells12 by involving a wide diversity of receptors such as kinins, receptor tyrosine kinases, transforming and epidermal growth factor receptors, the lectin receptor Gallectin-3, fibronectin, and Toll-like receptors13,14. In addition to these receptors, T. cruzi utilizes the complement molecules such as C1q to promote C1-dependent phagocytosis and the lectin proteins mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin-2 to evade host immune attack and promote infection10,15. Evans-Osses and collaborators (2014) suggested that the deposition of MBL on T. cruzi parasite surface plays a role in the infection process, while the parasite deactivates the lectin complement pathway16, which ultimately could favor T. cruzi cell internalization mediated by receptors for both molecules, including CR1.",

CR1, or CD35, is a multi-functional polymorphic glycoprotein, which occurs as a soluble or transmembrane protein expressed on peripheral blood cells including monocytes and erythrocytes, natural killer cells as well as on B and T cells17,20. CR1 is known to enhance phagocytosis of particles opsonized with C3b, C4b, C1q, MBL, and ficolin-2 as well as to facilitate the clearance of immune complexes by binding to CR1 on erythrocytes and macrophages for further disposal21,22. The CR1 gene is located on chromosome 1q32.2 (OMIM 120620) and belongs to the Regulator of Complement Activation family, which is characterized by small consensus repeats, also known as complement control protein repeats17,22. Genetic variability may influence CR1 expression including its molecular weight and the density of CR1 molecules on cell surfaces22,23.",

Moreover, it is known that, similarly to mechanisms used by other pathogens, T. cruzi uses C1q to promote C1-dependent phagocytosis as well as MBL and ficolin-2 to promote opsonization via CR1 as a strategy to evade the host immune system and infect host cells15.",

In fact, chagasic cardiomyopathy is known to be associated with inflammatory process and tissue damage, as observed in various inflammatory and infectious conditions41\u201344. Moreover, one of the consequences of the persistent myocardial damage in CD is left ventricular dilation with systolic dysfunction45. For this reason, left ventricular systolic function was evaluated in CD patients using the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). Despite the important role of the complement system in cardiovascular diseases46,47 such as atherosclerosis48,49, myocardial infarction50,51, and acute ischaemic stroke52, no correlation between CR1 levels and LVEF was found.

It was observed in this study that lower levels of CR1 were associated with rs6691117GG genotype in the controls, but not in patients. Two other studies found this genotype associated with lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate54 and with preterm birth55. These findings indicate that rs6691117GG genotype may modulate CR1 expression. Since there was no association between the rs6691117GG and CR1 levels in the patients, the reduction of CR1 levels in chronic CD is probably due to the disease process. An anti-inflammatory role for CR1 was already observed in experimental studies where CR1 was able to prevent tissue injury induced by complement activation56. Considering that chronic CD is associated with inflammation, it is possible that the low levels of CR1 in CD patients may be related to its anti-inflammatory effect and consumption due to complement activation. However, the exact mechanism, which controls the expression of CR1 in CD patients is still unclear.",

CD diagnosis was performed by two serological tests (ELISA and immunofluorescent antibody assay). Clinical findings were in accordance with those outlined by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO)2,65. Clinical details of the patients were obtained through medical records and interviews. Patients younger than 18 years old with recent infection or suspected non-chagasic cardiomyopathy were excluded. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the distinct CD forms are shown in Table 4. Patients with cardiomyopathy were graded according to the cardiac insufficiency classification of the American Heart Association, adapted for CD66: A, altered electrocardiogram (ECG) and normal echocardiogram (ECHO), absence of cardiac insufficiency (CI); B1, altered ECG, LVEF > 45%, absence of CI; B2, altered ECHO, LVEF < 45%, absence of CI; C, altered ECG and ECHO, compensable CI; D, altered ECG and ECHO, refractory CI. A group of 104 healthy Brazilians [mean age 51 years; 50 (48.1%) females, 54 (51.9%) males, 91 (87.5%) Euro-, 10 (9.6%) Afro-Brazilian, 2 (1.9%) Asian, 1 (1%) Amerindian] was used as control.

Following Brazilian health regulations, the blood donors were screened for CD, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2 using high sensitivity assays. Additionally, information about autoimmune diseases and cancer background was obtained during the pre-selection interview67,68. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (CEP/HC-UFPR n. 360.918/2013-08), and performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls.",

DNA from 12 patients and from two controls was degraded; therefore these individuals were excluded from further genetic analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy-coats using the QIAamp Blood mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The CR1 reference sequence was retrieved from the Ensembl database (www.ensembl.org); primers targeting exon 29 of CR1 gene were designed manually, tested using Primer-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast) and synthesized commercially (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). A fragment of 884 bp was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the CR1 locus specific primer pair CR1F (5\u2032-TCT TCA TAA ATA ATG CCA GAA GTG G-3\u2032) and CR1R (5\u2032-TGC CAA TTT CAT AGT CCT TAT ACA C-3\u2032). PCR amplifications were carried out in a 25 \u00b5l volume of reaction mixture containing 10 \u00d7 PCR buffer, 3.0 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 \u00b5M of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and 20 ng of genomic DNA on a TProfessional Basic Thermocycler (Biometra GmbH, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Cycling parameters were initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 55.5 \u00b0C for 30 seconds and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 1 minute, and a final elongation step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. PCR fragments were stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and visualised in a 1.5% agarose gel. PCR products were purified using Exo-SAP-IT (USB-Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA) and the purified products were directly used as templates for sequencing using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (v.3.1; Applied Biosystems, Texas, USA) on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. DNA polymorphisms were identified by assembling the sequences with the reference sequence of the CR1 (NM_000573) using the Geneious v9.1.4 software (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) and reconfirmed visually from their respective electropherograms.",

Multiple comparisons were corrected using a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure applying a false discovery rate of 0.10 and raw p-values that remained significant after this correction were considered in the study. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the STATA software (v. 12.0, StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). Correlation analyses were performed by non-parametric Spearman\u2019s rank coefficient tests. Allele frequencies were obtained by direct counting. Genotype and haplotype frequencies were analyzed by gene counting and expectation-maximum (EM) algorithms and the significance of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the random-permutation procedure as implemented in the Arlequin v. 3.5.2.2 software (http://lgb.unige.ch/arlequin). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed using Haploview v. 3.2 (http://broadinstitute.org/haploview). Possible associations of CR1 alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes with different clinical forms were evaluated with two-tailed Fisher exact tests. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.",
