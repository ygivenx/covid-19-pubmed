            "text": "Macrodomain is a conserved protein fold, existing either as a single protein or embedded within a larger protein, that has been identified in viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (reviewed in [1\u20133]). Originally identified as X-domains in viruses [4], these conserved regions were renamed macrodomains due to their similarity to the C-terminal domain of the histone H2A variant called MacroH2A [5]. This protein domain typically consists of 130\u2013190 amino acids that adopt a distinct fold consisting of a central beta sheet surrounded by 4 to 6 helices. Most macrodomains bind to monomeric ADP-ribose (MAR) and its derivatives, including ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphate (Appr1p), O-acyl-ADP-ribose, and the terminal ADP-ribose of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), as well as protein-conjugated MAR or PAR (i.e., MARylated or PARylated proteins) [6\u20139]. A subset of macrodomains also possess enzymatic activity to hydrolyze these ADP-ribose derivatives. In this Pearl, we will use viruses as examples to discuss the significance of the macrodomain and its associated enzymatic activities in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The role of macrodomains from other pathogens will be briefly explored at the end.",

It was later demonstrated that the first structurally characterized macrodomain, archaeal Af1521, also possessed enzymatic activity towards Appr1p and specifically bound ADP-ribose, MARylated and PARylated proteins [6,9,10]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that some macrodomains, such as MacroH2A, possessed an affinity for free and protein-conjugated ADP-ribose but lacked hydrolysis activity [10\u201313]. Recent informatics analyses have revealed 6 macrodomain subclasses [1]. The MacroD subclass was identified in all kingdoms of life, including viruses [1], and this subclass was demonstrated in vitro to dephosphorylate Appr1p (e.g., [14]), deacetylate O-acyl-ADP-ribose [7], and hydrolyze ADP-ribose from MARylated proteins [12,13,15\u201318] and, in some cases, PARylated proteins [17,18] (the last activity against ADP-ribosylated proteins is termed ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity). However, the in vivo substrates of MacroD-type macrodomains in humans, viruses, and other species remain unclear.",

            "text": "MacroD-type macrodomains are present in the non-structural proteins of a subset of positive-strand RNA viruses, including alphaviruses, coronaviruses, rubella virus, and hepatitis E virus (HEV) [1,4]. The macrodomain sequence is highly conserved in the nsP3 non-structural protein of alphaviruses such as Sindbis virus (SINV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and coronaviruses such as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A role for nsP3 in virulence was first identified for the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) [19]. Characterization of the functions of viral macrodomains has been aided by crystallography studies that identified critical residues for binding ADP-ribose (e.g., CHIKV structure in Fig 2A). In general, viruses with mutations in the ADP-ribose-binding sites of the macrodomain are not impaired for replication in most tissue culture cells, but often exhibit attenuated replication in differentiated cells and decreased virulence in vivo (Fig 2B) [16,20\u201325]. Comparable mutations in different classes of viruses often yield varying phenotypes. For example, mutations targeted at the ADP-ribose-binding site of the alphaviral macrodomain (SINV N10A, N24A) did not affect replication in baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cells but impaired replication in neurons and attenuated neurovirulence for mice [20]. Mutation of the coronavirus macrodomain at a site comparable to the alphavirus N24A site attenuated virulence and replication in mice and affected induction of and sensitivity to interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines [16,21,22,24]. Mutation at the corresponding position in the HEV macrodomain results in reduced or no replication in liver cancer cell lines [17,25]. Biochemical studies have further identified residues responsible for enzymatic activities against various ADP-ribose derivatives [7,12,13,26,27]. Some mutations in the catalytic loop region in HEV and alphaviruses are not tolerated [15,25]. For example, G32E in CHIKV (Fig 2A, loop 1) rapidly reverts to the wild-type amino acid in both mammalian and mosquito cells that lack functional IFN responses, suggesting that the enzymatic activity may be critical for alphaviral replication in both the host and vector independent of an innate IFN response [15].",

Given that mutations in the active site of viral macrodomains likely affect enzymatic activity toward all of these substrates, it is difficult to assign mutant phenotypes to specific ADP-ribose derivatives. Other criteria for in vivo macrodomain specificity should, therefore, be considered. For example, how conserved are macrodomain enzymatic activities across different viruses? How does the decreased virulence of mutants correlate with the deficiency of these activities? If the hydrolysis activity of viral macrodomains is involved in virulence, do the host enzymes that synthesize these ADP-ribose derivatives have antiviral properties?",

While all macrodomain-containing viruses replicate in the mammalian cell cytoplasm, most tRNA splicing occurs in the nucleus, whereas sirtuin-based deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation are present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus [28,29,34]. In humans, TRPT1 localizes in the mitochondria, and only 1 of 7 sirtuins localizes in the cytoplasm, whereas nearly all ADP-ribosyltransferases (except PARPs 1\u20133) localize to a significant extent in the cytoplasm [28,29,34]. Lastly, several PARPs, but not TRPT1 or any sirtuins, are induced by IFN as part of the vertebrate antiviral response [35]. Taken together, macrodomain ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity is likely critical for viral pathogenesis.",

Given the lack of conserved sequences between different macrodomain subclasses, it leaves open the possibility for more macrodomains and their functions to be discovered. Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses a nonMacroD-type macrodomain, which removes ADP-ribosylation from DNA, rather than protein, and antagonizes the action of a mycobacterial toxin that ADP-ribosylates DNA at specific thymidines [49]. Lastly, besides the macrodomain family, there is another major class of ADP-ribosylation removal enzyme called DraG/ARH, and they are also found in all kingdoms of life, including viruses [42,50]. Unlike MacroD-type macrodomains, which remove ADP-ribosylation from acidic residues, ARH members remove ADP-ribosylation from arginine [51] and serine [43,52]. Therefore, one can speculate that pathogens may have multiple enzymes to remove ADP-ribosylation from specific classes of amino acids.",
