However, there is no description of the type of mask. Considering the results\npresented in this review as the size of the aerosols formed, suggests the use of N95\nmask (a mask that has the capacity to filter particles <3\u03bcm) in the mentioned\nareas\n2\n\n,\n\n13\n, although no studies have assessed the risk of disease transmission via aerosol\ngenerated in cleaning activities. It is known that, in the chain of transmission of\ninfections, there is need for interaction between the elements: host susceptibility,\npresence, source, input port and output of the infectious agent and a vehicle of\ntransmission, in addition to the amount of it. Therefore, the risk of CSD employees, or\nother areas of health services being infected by aerosols vary fundamentally according\nto the elements of infection transmission chain\n19\n. ",
