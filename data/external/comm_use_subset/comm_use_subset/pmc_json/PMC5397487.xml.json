            "text": "Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a member of the Ntaya virus group within the genus Flavivirus of family Flaviviridae (Yan et al., 2011). TMUV strains were firstly isolated from mosquitoes in Malaysia and Thailand, but their pathogenicity is not fully understood (Platt et al., 1975; Pandey et al., 1999). Sitiawan virus, a broiler-origin TMUV strain, was the first pathogenic virus causing encephalitis and retarded growth in broiler chicks (Kono et al., 2000). Since 2009, Chinese domestic poultry including ducks, chickens, and geese have been manifesting a new epidemic disease caused by a TMUV-related flavivirus, named as avian Tembusu virus (ATMUV). This outbreak was quickly spread to many provinces of China and several south-eastern Asian countries (Homonnay et al., 2014; Thontiravong et al., 2015). ATMUV genome consists of a single strand positive-sense RNA and encodes three structural proteins [capsid (C), pre-membrane (PrM/M), and envelope (E)] and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (Liu et al., 2013; Homonnay et al., 2014). ATMUV-infected adult animals showed symptoms of hemorrhagic ovaritis and acute egg drop syndrome, high fever, anorexia, diarrhea, ataxia, weight loss and paralysis, with a high morbidity (90\u2013100%), and mortality ranged from 0 to 30% depending on different management and weather conditions, leading to enormous economic losses to poultry industry in China (Cao et al., 2011; Su et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012, 2013; Chen et al., 2013). The young flocks are more vulnerable to ATMUV infection, characterized by similar clinical symptoms including anorexia, diarrhea, high fever and severe neurologic dysfunction, with a higher mortality than adult birds (Vaidya et al., 2012; Ti et al., 2015). ATMUV was easily detected in ovaries and theca folliculi of infected animals, suggesting that the reproductive tissues were the major targets for the viral infection and replication (Liu et al., 2012). Viral RNA was also detected in spleen, trachea, kidney, brain, and blood of infected host (Yan et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012). In addition, it was observed that ATMUV could infect various cell lines including DEF, CEF, DF-1, BHK-21, Vero, A549, 293T, and HeLa, resulting in a noticeable cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by cell shrinkage, rounding and detachment (Chen et al., 2016a; Wang H. J. et al., 2016).",

But a disease associated with ATMUV infection has not been found in human. Moreover, it was shown that ATMUV failed to cause any clinical manifestation or viremia in non-human primates, indicating that ATMUV is unlikely to emerge as a human pathogen for the time being (Wang H. J. et al., 2016). However, due to zoonotic nature of its genus Flavivirus relatives, ATMUV might be a potential threat to human health in the future (Bowen et al., 1975; Liu et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Host innate immune response serves as the first line of defense against the infection of pathogens at the early stages. Innate immune system recognizes viruses invasion via specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to sense pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by viruses. Activated PRRs then interact with adaptor proteins such as interferon-\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1), MyD88, and TRIF (Takeuchi and Akira, 2009). The ligations of PRRs with adaptor proteins result in the activation of the transcription factors, including NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factors (IRF3 and IRF7) (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010). IRFs and NF-\u03baB translocate to the nucleus where they stimulate the expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs). Then interaction between the IFNs and their receptors causes activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Phosphorylated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus and combine with interferon regulatory proteins to promote an abundant expression of a wide array of genes, including IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010; Tan et al., 2012; Bailey et al., 2014). These ISGs encode distinct antiviral proteins with diverse biological effects that block multiple stages of the viral lifecycle including viral entry, translation, replication, assembly, and spread (Diamond and Farzan, 2013).",

            "text": "The interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of small transmembrane proteins belonging to ISG superfamily and strongly induced by IFNs (Perreira et al., 2013). The IFITM proteins are the distinct restriction factors known to block viral entry, including restriction of virus fusion with the late endosomal or lysosomal compartments and penetration into the cytoplasm (Diamond and Farzan, 2013; Li et al., 2013). It has been shown that gene cluster IFTIM1, 2, and 3, the immune-related genes, are critically involved in immune defense against a broad variety of viruses, including influenza virus, dengue virus, filoviruses, coronavirus, hepatitis C virus, lyssaviruses, and West Nile virus (Brass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2013; Wilkins et al., 2013). Conversely, IFITMs have little or no effect on several other viruses, including human papillomavirus, human cytomegalovirus and adenovirus type 5, arenavirus, murine leukemia virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Warren et al., 2013; Bailey et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Despite the progresses in understanding of IFITM-mediated antiviral ability, host IFITM expression profiles in response to ATMUV infection are still not clear. Little is known about this immune-related ISG family in restricting ATMUV pathogenesis.",

Interestingly, we observed that ATMUV infection could trigger duck innate immune response including robust expression of particular type I and type III IFNs and IFITM family proteins. Using DF-1 cell system, we found that knockdown of endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) markedly enhanced ATMUV infection in host. However, silencing IFITM2 had no significant effect on ATMUV replication. Furthermore, overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 could strongly inhibit the replication of ATMUV. These results reveal that avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 but not IFITM2 serve as the critical components of host innate immune defense against ATMUV infection.",

            "text": "Our previous studies had shown that ATMUV infection effectively triggers the host innate immune response, including robust upregulation of type I and type III IFNs and some critical ISGs in chicken and CEF (Chen et al., 2016a). However, innate immune response against ATMUV infection in duck still remains to be determined. Importantly, the role of IFITMs in defending against ATMUV infection has not been well-defined in any avian species. Here, we examined the expression profile of IFNs and IFITMs in parenchymal organs of ducks infected with ATMUV using qRT-PCR and RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that ATMUV has higher replication in duckling spleen tissues, as indicated by obvious expression of viral E gene (Figure 1A; Supplementary Figure 1). Remarkably, the mRNA levels of type I and type III IFNs were gradually elevated and reached their maximum value on 24 hpi and then declined gradually. In particular, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 were greatly upregulated by 152- and 1,415-fold at 24 hpi, respectively (Figures 2A,B). The expression of IFN-\u03bb was modestly upregulated by 8.5-fold at 24 hpi (Figure 2C). The expression of duck IFITM1, 2, and 3 were gradually induced and reached their maximum value at 72 hpi. Strikingly, expression of duck IFITM1 was markedly increased by over 100-folds at 72 hpi (Figures 2D\u2013F). These observations were further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). Moreover, we examined the mRNA expression profile of IFNs and IFITMs in kidney and bursa of fabricius tissues. We found that in kidneys, the mRNA levels of IFNs and IFITMs were modestly upregulated until 48 hpi and then declined (Supplementary Figure 2). IFNs and IFITMs expressions in bursa of fabricius were slightly increased with the highest levels at 12 hpi and then declined (Supplementary Figure 3). Taken together, these data indicate that ATMUV infection can trigger innate immune response in ducklings, including upregulation of IFNs and IFITMs.",

For this, DEFs were prepared and infected with ATMUV, and the mRNA expression of particular IFNs and IFITMs were then analyzed using qRT-PCR. ATMUV replicated well in DEFs with an obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by cell shrinking, rounding and detachment at 48 hpi (Figure 3A). Analysis of IFA showed that viral antigens were detected in DEF cells at 24\u201348 hpi, indicating that DEF cells could be infected by the virus (Figure 3B). The mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03bb were significantly elevated in ATMUV infected DEFs during ATMUV infection as compared to mock-treated control. Expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 was increased by about 700- and 340-fold at 48 hpi, respectively (Figures 3C\u2013E). IFN-\u03bb expression was also significantly induced with a highest 4.5-fold at 48 hpi. These data were consistent with the in vivo studies presented above. Strikingly, duck IFITM1 was greatly induced and reached their maximum value (52-fold) at 12 hpi and then declined gradually (Figure 3F). Expression of duck IFITM2 and IFITM3 were enhanced modestly and reached their maximal levels by 6.8- and 6.3-fold at 36 hpi, respectively (Figures 3G,H). These results were further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Figure 4).

Furthermore, we tested that whether these IFITMs functioned in defense against the virus infection. For this, we generated stable DF-1 cell lines expressing specific shRNAs targeting IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, or luciferase control, respectively. These cells were then infected with ATMUV and harvested at indicated times (24, 36, and 48 hpi). Interference efficiency of the shRNAs was examined by qRT-PCR and viral load in cell culture supernatants was titrated via TCID50 assay. Compared with the control shRNA targeting luciferase, the specific shRNAs caused decreased expression of IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 after ATMUV infection, respectively (Figures 5A\u2013C). Interestingly, silencing endogenous IFITM1 or IFITM3 resulted in significant increase in viral load, as evidenced by higher viral titers in culture supernatants from the IFITM1 or IFITM3 knockdown cells than those in supernatants of luciferase control cells (Figure 5D). However, knockdown of IFITM2 only slightly enhanced ATMUV replication (Figure 5D). To confirm these findings, DF-1 cell lines expressing specific shRNA targeting each of these IFITMs were infected with ATMUV and harvested at 36 hpi, followed by qRT-PCR assay to detect mRNA expression of viral genes. Consistent with the results from TCID50 assay, data of qRT-PCR showed that mRNA expression of viral envelope and NS5 genes was clearly increased in IFITM1 or IFITM3 knockdown cells as compared to the control cells. However, no significant difference was observed in viral load between IFITM2 knockdown and luciferase control cells after infection with ATMUV (Figure 5E). This data suggests that disrupting the endogenous expression of chicken IFITM1 and IFITM3 but not IFITM2 can strongly enhance the ATMUV replication in DF-1 cells.",

DF-1 cells were then transiently transfected with constructs expressing chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 or empty vector, respectively and challenged with ATMUV. Virus titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by TCID50 assay at 24, 36, and 48 hpi. The forced expression of IFITMs in DF-1 cells was examined by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 6A, flag-tagged IFITM proteins were expressed well in DF-1 cells (Figure 6A).

To further confirm this observation, the DF-1 cells were infected with ATMUV and harvested at 36 hpi, followed by qRT-PCR to examine the viral gene expression.

BLASTX search showed that the chIFITM1 (KX811737) shared 100, 83.19, 45.11, 34.4, 30.7, and 35.48% amino acid identity to IFITM1 protein of chicken (KC876032.1), coturnix (XM_015863379.1), duck (KX811738), human (AK290480.1), mouse (XM_006536238.1), and sus scrofa (XM_003124230.2), respectively. chIFITM3 (KX811740) shared 99.27, 90.51, 75.18, 31.54, 32.21, and 33.78% amino acid identity to IFITM3 protein of chicken (XM001233949.4), coturnix (XM_015863375.1), duck (KX811739), human (BC070243.1), mouse (NM-025378.2), and sus scrofa (NM_001201382.1), respectively. Two putative transmembrane domains were obtained by using transmembrane prediction programs TMHMM 2 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) and TMpred (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html). Chicken and duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins could be divided into five domains reflecting their hydrophobicity and conservation as identified in other species (Figure 7A), including a variable, hydrophobic N-terminal domain (NTD), a conserved hydrophobic intramembrane domain (IMD), a conserved intracellular loop (CIL), a variable, hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD), and a short, highly variable C-terminal domain (CTD). Although significant divergence is seen between avian and mammalian IFITM1 and IFITM3 sequences, several residues are conserved and important for antiviral function, including important amino acids (Y20, C74, C75, K86, K91, and K107) in IFITM3 (Smith et al., 2013; Blyth et al., 2015). Phylogenetic analysis exhibited that avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 are distinct from those of mammalian species, but avian IFITM3 is more conserved than avian IFITM1 (Figure 7B).",

On the basis of typical clinical symptoms, ATMUV was initially described as duck egg drop syndrome virus (DEDSV). However, this virus exhibits a wide range of pathogenicity to avian species including ducks, chicken, geese, house sparrows, and racing pigeon, and its genome is closely related to Tembusu virus strains. Flavivirus isolates with a more than 84% nucleotide sequence homology in the NS5 region are considered to be the same species (Kuno et al., 1998). So we propose to name this novel flavivirus as \u201cAvian Temubsu virus, ATMUV.\u201d",

The previous studies have shown that ATMUV infection induced an effective antiviral immunity through MDA5 and TLR3-dependent signaling pathways (Li et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016a; Fu et al., 2016). However, our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of interaction between the virus and host antiviral immune system is very limited. In this study, we examined the expression profile of key IFNs and IFITMs following ATMUV infection in vivo and in vitro. We found type I, type III IFNs, and immune-related IFITMs, including IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were significantly upregulated in response to ATMUV infection. Strikingly, the spleen tissue had a high viral load and showed strong innate immune response as compared to other organs. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression levels in spleen were increased significantly at 24 hpi and decreased after this time point, and the mRNA levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2 were also upregulated. Similar results were shown in kidney and bursa of fabricius tissues in infected animals. Although IFN expression in DEFs was triggered and reached the maximum value at 48 hpi, DEFs displayed an apparent CPE by ATMUV infection at this time point. These data suggest that host innate immune response is triggered by ATMUV, but the virus has developed multiple strategies to evade host antiviral immunity. In a recent study, Wang and his co-workers found that ATMUV NS1 could markedly suppress virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 expression by inhibiting RLR receptor signaling (Wang J. et al., 2016). Most flaviviruses are potent in blocking the JAK-STAT pathway to evade the antiviral effects of the host innate immune system (Heim et al., 1999; Basu et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2004; Green et al., 2014). Thus, further studies are needed to address the precise mechanisms by which ATMUV circumvents the host innate immune response.",

Expression of IFITMs is strongly induced by IFNs (Smith et al., 2013). Consistent with previous studies (Smith et al., 2013), our data showed that stimulation of DF-1 cells with chicken IFNs significantly enhanced the expression of IFITMs. Interestingly, we observed that IFITM1 in ATMUV infected DEFs had a faster kinetic response than ATMUV-induced IFNs. Thus, we assessed whether IFITMs expression is totally IFN-dependent. For this, siRNA specifically targeting chicken interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (chIFNAR1-siRNA) and negative control siRNA (NC-siRNA) were employed in this study. 100 nM chIFNAR1-siRNA or NC-siRNA was transfected into DF-1 cell. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were infected with ATMUV and harvested at 24 hpi. Interestingly, disruption of endogenous IFNAR1 by siRNA greatly reduced IFITM2 mRNA expression, but only caused modest downregulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 (Supplementary Figure 6). The data suggest that chIFITM2 may not share the same IFN-dependent pathways with chIFITM1 and chIFITM3. Previous study has found that murine IFITM3 expression was not only induced by increased expression of type I or II IFNs, but also upregulated by other cytokines such as IL-6 (Bailey et al., 2012). Other groups also found that expression of IFI-56K, IFI-54K, and ISG56 was induced directly by virus and then triggered secondarily through virus-induced IFNs (Wathelet et al., 1988; Holzinger et al., 2007). These findings indicate that multiple signaling pathways might be involved in regulation of IFITM expression during the viral infection.",

In order to survive, some viruses such as arenavirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus have evolved multiple strategies to evade the antiviral effects of IFITMs (Bailey et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Furthermore, human cytomegalovirus could exploit IFITMs to facilitate morphogenesis of virion assembly compartment (Xie et al., 2014). To investigate the role of IFITM proteins in restricting ATMUV replication, we generated DF-1 cell lines stably disrupting chicken IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 expression. Indeed, disruption of endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 by shRNA greatly enhanced ATMUV infection. Furthermore, ectopic expression of chicken and duck IFITM1 or IFITM3 markedly inhibited ATMUV replication. Interestingly, chIFITM2 was significantly upregulated after ATMUV infection in vitro, but we found that altering IFITM2 expression had mild effect on ATMUV infection. A previous report showed that duck IFITM1 was greatly upregulated after highly pathogenic IAV infection but its antiviral activity was low in vitro (Blyth et al., 2015). The differences in viral entry mechanisms of IAV and ATMUV in the different types of host cells may account for the differential antiviral activity of IFITM proteins.",

This may be due to high basal expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the cells tested. In addition, we cloned and characterized chicken and duck species of IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes. Despite sharing low amino acid identity between chicken IFITM1 and duck IFITM1 (45.11%) and high amino acid identity between chicken IFITM3 and duck IFITM3 (75.18%), both chicken and duck origin IFITM1 and IFITM3 could effectively restrict ATMUV replication.
