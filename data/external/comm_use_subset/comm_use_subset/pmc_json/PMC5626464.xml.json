            "text": "Burkholderia pseudomallei causes the potentially fatal disease melioidosis in humans and animals [1]. Central to the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei is its ability to adopt a facultative intracellular life style involving lysis of the vacuolar membrane and escape into the cytoplasm of the host cell [2, 3]. After gaining access to the cytosol, the bacteria impose a cytopathic effect upon host cells by fusing the infected cell with one or more neighboring cells, leading to the formation of multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) [4]. While the ability to induce cell-cell fusions is unique for bacteria it is a common trait among enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency, measles and herpes virus [5\u20137]. The induction of host cell fusions is proposed to facilitate dissemination of the virus and escape from immune defenses, such as neutralizing antibodies [8, 9]. The same might apply for B. pseudomallei-stimulated MNGC formation, for which the biological function has yet to be determined. The type VI secretion system 5 (T6SS-5; also named T6SS1) present in B. pseudomallei and the closely related species Burkholderia thailandensis is specifically expressed inside host cells and is essential for the induction of MNGCs [10\u201314]. Importantly, the T6SS-5 is a major virulence factor in animal models of infection [10, 15, 16]. This finding suggests a central role of host membrane fusion during B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis infection although the T6SS-5 still awaits full functional characterization.",

The protein, VgrG-5, belongs to the group of specialized VgrG proteins that contain a variable C-terminal extension in addition to the ubiquitous domains that form the needle of the T6S apparatus. The C-terminal domain of VgrG-5 is required for MNGC formation and initiation of a lethal infection in mice but not for secretory activity of the T6SS-5 [12, 13].

Likewise, an injection device such as the T6SS-5 is a novel player in the field of cell-cell fusion. The plasma membrane rearrangements induced by the T6SS-5 are unknown. In addition, the role of proteins located on the surface of the host cell in MNGC formation has not been investigated. Surface-exposed components of the host cell such as membrane proteins are critically involved in membrane fusions induced by several viruses by specifically activating viral fusion proteins and determining viral host cell tropism [17\u201319]. Furthermore, the specific composition of the lipid membranes influences the fusion process. In particular, cholesterol, an abundant component of plasma membranes, can significantly affect membrane fusion by i) altering the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer, ii) direct interactions with fusion proteins or iii) formation of cholesterol rich membrane rafts clustering fusion proteins and host receptors [20\u201322]. In this study, we sought to gain insight into the mechanism of T6SS-5-mediated membrane fusion by investigating the role of host cell factors. We found that host cell surface proteins and cholesterol contribute to MNGC formation induced by B. thailandensis.",

As a control, we infected macrophages with a mutant lacking an essential component of the T6SS-5, TssK-5, which we will refer to as \u0394T6SS-5 [16]. This mutant is unable to induce MNGC formation in untreated RAW264.7 macrophages and other cells [23] (S1 Fig). To determine the role of host cell surface proteins in T6SS-5 mediated cell-cell fusions, macrophages infected with B. thailandensis wild type were incubated with 0.05% trypsin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C approximately 3 h before the onset of MNGC formation. Treatment of the macrophages with trypsin leads to detachment and requires agarose overlay assays to bring them back into contact with the plate surface and other macrophages for monitoring MNGC formation. To relate the effect of proteolytic treatment on host cell fusion to an appropriate control (i.e. to cells that underwent the same experimental procedure), we incubated infected macrophages with 0.05% EDTA, a treatment that also resulted in cellular detachment. Successful cleavage of surface proteins was confirmed by staining the cells with an APC-conjugated antibody against integrin \u03b2-2, an abundant surface exposed protein and subsequent analysis by flow cytometry. Trypsin treatment resulted in an approximately 14-fold reduction of mean fluorescence intensity of APC compared with EDTA treated cells indicating efficient break down of surface proteins (Fig 1A). Trypan blue staining showed that 99% of trypsin treated macrophages were viable (Fig 1B).",

The cells were collected, counted and seeded using agarose overlay to bring the macrophages into contact. Virtually no host cell fusions of EDTA and trypsin treated macrophages were observed 2 h after seeding (Fig 1C and S2 Fig). At 5 h post seeding, MNGC formation of cells incubated with EDTA and trypsin was detectable, which differed significantly in the extent between the two treatments. We found that B. thailandensis stimulated 26% MNGC formation in EDTA treated cells whereas proteolytic treatment reduced the number of cell-cell fusions to 12% (Fig 1C and S2 Fig). These results indicate that protein(s) located on the host cell surface contribute to the fusion process induced by B. thailandensis. MNGC formation of EDTA and trypsin treated cells was similar after an 8 h recovery from the respective treatment. This finding confirms that the observed difference in the number of cell-cell fusions at 5 h post seeding was not due to reduced viability of the macrophages treated with trypsin. Consistent with previous studies demonstrating a requirement of the T6SS-5 for MNGC formation of untreated cells, we did not observe cell-cell fusions in trypsin treated macrophages infected with B. thailandensis \u0394T6SS-5 at 5 and 8 h post seeding (Fig 1D and S2 Fig).",

These donor cells were mixed at equal ratios with uninfected and untreated cells and seeded using agarose overlay assays. A 49% and 24% MNGC formation efficiency was observed for EDTA and trypsin treated donor cells, respectively, when mixed with untreated recipient cells for approximately 3\u20134 h (Fig 2C and S3 Fig). To investigate the contribution of proteins located on the surface of recipient cells to T6SS-5 mediated host cell fusions, uninfected macrophages were incubated with trypsin or EDTA and mixed at equal ratios with cells infected with B. thailandensis at MOI 33 for 6 h but otherwise untreated. Proteolytic treatment of recipient cells with trypsin resulted in significantly reduced MNGC formation (40%) as compared with EDTA treatment (53%), although the decrease was less pronounced than that observed upon protein depletion of donor cells (Fig 2D and S3 Fig). These results suggest that trypsin sensitive surface protein(s) on both the infected and the neighboring uninfected cell might contribute to T6SS-5-stimulated cell-cell fusion.",

The T6SS-5 mutant is defective in induction of MNGC formation of M\u03b2CD treated cells (Fig 3D and S4 Fig).

Viability assays of macrophages following the same treatment showed no cytotoxic effect (Fig 4B). The influence of additional cholesterol on MNGC formation was investigated by adding cholesterol to macrophages at the same time when infection with B. thailandensis was initiated followed by a 10 h incubation period. Thus, to control for confounding effects of cholesterol on bacteria we determined the number of intracellular bacteria after treatment of macrophages with 4 \u03bcg/ml cholesterol for 10 h. The number of colony forming units was similar between treated and untreated host cells indicating that phagocytosis and intracellular survival of B. thailandensis was not affected by the addition of cholesterol (Fig 4C). Macrophages infected with B. thailandensis in absence of exogenously added cholesterol showed 13% MNGC formation (Fig 4D). Supplementing the medium with 4 \u03bcg/ml cholesterol significantly reduced the number of cell-cell fusions as compared with untreated cells (Fig 4D and S4 Fig).

Incubation of the cells with 50 ng/ml IL-4 alone or 50 ng/ml IL-4 and 4 \u03bcg/ml cholesterol did not result in significantly different MNGC formation (Fig 4E and S5 Fig).

Progress in elucidating the molecular basis of T6SS-5 induced cell-cell fusions is hampered by the circumstance that the activity of the potential effector protein VgrG-5 is unknown and the possibility that other as yet unidentified effector proteins participate in MNGC formation. Furthermore, the T6SS-5 is the first injection device and the first system of bacterial origin described to be involved in mediating membrane fusions. Thus, information on related systems to guide functional analysis of the T6SS-5 is absent. In addition, the host cellular location where T6SS-5 effector(s) are targeted to remains to be determined. These facts led us to investigate the role of host factors to gain insight into the mechanism underlying cell-cell fusions stimulated by the T6SS-5. To this end, we focused on cell surface proteins and cholesterol which are of critical importance in viral induced membrane fusions during virus entry or cell-cell fusion [30\u201334]. We found that acute depletion of host cell surface proteins and cholesterol from macrophages infected with B. thailandensis decreased T6SS-5 induced host cell fusions.",

Similar assays were performed to analyze the nature of the receptor of dengue and Ebola virus using trypsin and proteinase K incubation of target cells, respectively [35, 36]. Proteolytic depletion of surface proteins of infected macrophages markedly reduced MNGC formation ability of B. thailandensis indicating that T6SS-5 mediated membrane fusion requires a trypsin-sensitive protein(s) on the host cell. Likewise, the depletion of surface proteins specifically on infected donor cells or uninfected recipient cells decreased the number of cell-cell fusions. Whether the T6SS-5 is used by the bacteria to puncture the plasma membrane for delivery of effector proteins to the extracellular milieu or into the neighboring uninfected cell is currently unknown. Another possible scenario is that Burkholderia injects T6SS-5 effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell they infect. The potential involvement of a host protein(s) on the cell surface in MNGC formation suggests that it functions as a target or receptor of the T6SS-5 which might indicate exposure of T6SS-5 effector(s) to the external milieu. In this case, the effect observed for depletion of proteins on infected donor cells could be ascribed to degradation of the T6SS-5 effector protein(s) during trypsin treatment. Another possibility is that the T6SS-5 acts from the inside of the host cell on a surface exposed target. However, depletion of surface proteins on uninfected recipient cells caused a significant reduction in MNGC formation compared with the internal control EDTA. This result indicates that host cell protein(s) contribute to the fusion process. A potential role of one or more host surface proteins as a target of the T6SS-5 has to be elucidated in future studies. In fact, specific interactions of viral glycoproteins with cell surface receptors such as the binding of the HIV Env gp120 subunit with its primary host receptor CD4 is necessary to stimulate membrane fusion [37, 38].",

While this treatment did not exert adverse effects on the viability of macrophages and bacteria it diminished host cell fusion. In contrast, the exogenous addition of cholesterol did not influence MNGC formation of macrophages induced by IL-4. Together with the data on M\u03b2CD treatment these results suggest that T6SS-5 stimulated MNGC formation is influenced by cholesterol and, furthermore, that a certain cholesterol level is necessary for optimal MNGC formation. The latter is in line with a previous study demonstrating that both M\u03b2CD-based depletion of cholesterol and enrichment of cholesterol of host cells decreases internalization of Mycobacterium smegmatis into host cells [40]. Although entry of M. smegmatis into host cells does not involve membrane fusion it is based on the interaction of the bacteria with host surface proteins [41]. The authors of this study propose that membrane receptors implicated in M. smegmtatis entry require an optimal cholesterol content for conformation and function. Likewise, the effect of varying cholesterol concentrations on B. thailandensis-stimulated MNGC formation might be due to the interaction of a T6SS-5 protein with a host receptor that is located in cholesterol enriched membrane rafts or directly interacts with cholesterol. This assumption would explain the requirement of proteins on the host cell surface and optimal cholesterol levels for T6SS-5-induced MNGC formation. Indeed, it has been shown that the HIV gp120 receptor CD4 is associated with cholesterol enriched domains [42]. Additionally, it is conceivable that T6SS-5 effector protein(s) are targeted to cholesterol enriched domains and that altering cholesterol levels perturbs insertion or conformation of the protein(s). Assuming that T6SS-5 mediated cell-cell fusion involves bending of both membranes cholesterol could also affect MNGC formation by modulating firmness, fluidity or intrinsic curvature of the plasma membrane [43, 44].",
