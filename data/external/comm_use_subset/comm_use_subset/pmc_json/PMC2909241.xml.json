The notion k-noncrossing stipulates that the complexity of a pseudoknot is related to the maximal number of mutually crossing bonds. Indeed, most natural RNA pseudoknots are 3-noncrossing [30].",

In fact this is, on the level of entire folding maps, guaranteed by the combinatorics of the target structures alone. It has been shown in [31], that the numbers of 3-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures, satisfying the biophysical constraints grows asymptotically as c3n-52.03n, where c3 >0 is some explicitly known constant. In view of the central limit theorems of [32], this fact implies the existence of extended (exponentially large) sets of sequences that all fold into one 3-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structure, S. In other words, the combinatorics of 3-noncrossing RNA structures alone implies that there are many sequences mapping (folding) into a single structure. The set of all such sequences is called the neutral network of the structure S [33,34], see Figure 7. The term \"neutral network\" as opposed to \"neutral set\" stems from giant component results of random induced subgraphs of n-cubes. That is, neutral networks are typically connected in sequence space.",

Since LOCAL-SEARCH will stop (line 4) if Tstart = T (line 3), the remainder of LOCAL-SEARCH, i.e. lines 7 to 41 run for (fh - 1) times, each such execution having complexity O(\u2113h).
