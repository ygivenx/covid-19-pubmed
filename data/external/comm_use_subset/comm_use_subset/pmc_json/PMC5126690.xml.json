Overall arthritis severity in CIA mice was assessed by macroscopic clinical scoring. Administration of SM934 (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the clinical signs of arthritis since 4 days after treatment, indicated by the reduction in the mean arthritis score, the therapeutic effect was comparable with the methotrexate (MTX, 1 mg/kg), a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment control used in comparison with arthritic group (Fig. 1B). Representative photographs displaying morphological changes of left hind paws of mice from individual group on day 14 after treatment are shown in Fig. 1C, macroscopic evidence of arthritis such as erythema or swelling was markedly observed in saline-treated CIA mice compared with normal DBA/1J mice, while SM934 and MTX treatment significantly ameliorated arthritis severity in CIA mice.",

On the contrast, neither proportion of FAS+ GL-7+ GC B cells (Fig. 4C) nor the frequency of Th1 (statistical result in Supplementary Fig. S2) or regulatory T (Treg) cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) changed notably after SM934 treatment. In order to further confirm the effect of SM934 on Tfh and Th17 cells in vivo, we introduced the SRBC- and OVA-immunized mice treated with SM934 for 9 day and 7 day respectively. As expected, in both experiments, SM934 treatment significantly diminished Tfh population in comparison with saline-treated ones. SM934 treatment also significantly suppressed the Th17 expansion in OVA-immunized mice, whereas no statistical significance was observed between SRBC-immunized mice treated with SM934 and with saline (Supplementary Fig. S3).",

            "text": "It is well documented that the GC B cells are precursors of antigen-specific memory B cell and long-lived plasma cells (PC). As for the role of Tfh cells, GC B cells and Th cell-B cell interaction in an antigen-specific response, Hu and colleagues43 suggested a reasonable illustration, using a SRBC-challenged mice and co-culture experiment, that it was the generation of Tfh cells, rather than direct activation B cells by Tfh cells, should be the primary mechanism modulating IgG antibody production. Moreover, there are plenty of molecular and cellular underpinnings in the development of B cell memory and PC formation, including molecular interactions that organize at cellular interfaces of Th cells and GC B cells. Reports have identified numbers of surface molecules implicated in the checkpoint of GC B cell development: CD40-CD40L and ligation play an essential role in class switch recombination and GC formation44; ICOS-B7RP-1(ICOSL) costimulation is critical for production of cytokines lead to B cell activation and differentiation43; CD30-CD153 interactions have an inhibitory effect antibody production in vivo45. Together, during the formation of antibody-producing cells, Tfh cells provide necessary help to GC B cells in terms of costimulatory signals and differentiation factors. In current study, SM934 impeded the propagation of Tfh cells and controlled autoantibody production in CIA mice without altering the population of GC B cells. We speculated that the suppression on the generation Tfh cells and IL-21, the critical executor of B cell fate, should be responsible for this phenomenon. Nevertheless, what specific action would SM934 have on memory B cells and long-live plasma cells in RA status, could it regulate the expression of surface molecules on Tfh cells were unknown and required further investigation.",

Accumulating reports have indicated a distinct role of Th17 cells in supporting B cell responses. Bauquet et al.46 demonstrated that Th17 cells and Tfh cells shared several features, including the expression of ICOS and IL-21. Patakas et al.23 stated that Th17 cells have a significant role earlier in the initiation/development of the GC responses, by using T cell and B cell receptor transgenic mice specific for model antigens. Mitsdoerffer et al.24 found that even IL-17 on its own, could drive class switch recombination in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-immunized 2D2 TCR transgenic mice. As one of the major producer of IL-17 and IL-21, Th17 cells might not only act as proinflammatory characters47 but also incitement of excessive GC reaction and antibody production in RA pathology. In light of these properties, the subsequent effect of the suppression on Th17 cells by SM934, could facilitate the general repression of antigen-specific antibody production in CIA mice as well as in SRBC- and OVA-challenged mice.",

            "text": "IL-21 exerts pleiotropic actions on the immune system. Besides engagement in the function of T cells, natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells (DCs), IL-21 exerts profound influence on B cell biology. Our results showed that SM934 treatment inhibited the production of IL-21 from CD4+ T cells and abolished the downstream signaling of IL-21 through STAT3, coincided with the decreased level of antibodies and reduction of Tfh cells and Th17 cells. Actually, IL-21 serves as an autocrine factor secreted by Tfh and Th17 cells that promotes or sustains Tfh and Th17 lineage commitment in a STAT3-dependent manner2748. Moreover, STAT3 not only plays as the transduction element of IL-21 signaling, but also binds the Il21 promoter directly and modulates IL-21-responsive genes49. Therefore, SM934 treatment could interfere IL-21 circuit including IL-21 per se and STAT3 activation, which thus reinforce the inhibitory effects of SM934 on Tfh and Th17 cells. Furthermore, IL-21 can induce various fate on B cells, depending on the interplay with costimulatory signals and on the developmental stage of a B cell: in B cells that encounter antigen and receive T cell help, IL-21 induces survival, proliferation, isotype switching, and differentiation to antibody-secreting PCs; in those B cells receiving signals via BCR alone, as can be the case for some autoantigens, or via TLR, IL-21 costimulation causes apoptosis50. These features of IL-21 suggested that there might be a discrepancy between the mechanisms of SM934 on the spontaneous autoimmune diseases and antigen-induced immune responses, relevant to IL-21, which is worthy an attentive investigation in further studies.",
