It was first isolated from the blood and thoracic empyema of an alcoholic liver cirrhosis patient in Hong Kong [2]. In a prospective study, L. hongkongensis was shown to be associated with community acquired gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea [3],[4]. L. hongkongensis is likely to be globally distributed, as travel histories from patients suggested its presence in at least four continents: Asia, Europe, Africa and Central America [4]\u2013[6]. L. hongkongensis has been found in up to 60% of the intestines of commonly consumed freshwater fish, such as grass carp and bighead carp [4],[7],[8]. It has also been isolated from drinking water reservoirs in Hong Kong [9]. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing showed that the fish and patient isolates fell into separate clusters, suggesting that some clones could be more virulent or adapted to human [8],[10]. These data strongly suggest that this bacterium is a potential diarrheal pathogen that warrants further investigations.",

In view of its potential clinical importance, distinct phylogenetic position, interesting phenotypic characteristics and the availability of genetic manipulation systems [14]\u2013[17], we sequenced and annotated the complete genome of a strain (HLHK9) of L. hongkongensis recovered from a 36-year old previously healthy Chinese patient with profuse diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain [4]. Proteomes of L. hongkongensis growing at 37\u00b0C (body temperature of human) and 20\u00b0C (average temperature of freshwater habitat in fall and winter) [9] were also compared.",

In terms of genome size and number of predicted coding sequences (CDSs), rRNA operons and tRNA genes (Table 1), L. hongkongensis falls into a position intermediate between C. violaceum and the pathogenic Neisseria species. A similar intermediate status was also observed when the CDSs were classified into Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) functional categories, except for genes of RNA processing and modification (COG A), cell cycle control, mitosis and meiosis (COG D), replication, recombination and repair (COG L) and extracellular structures (COG W), of which all four bacteria have similar number of genes (Figure 2). This is in line with the life cycles and growth requirements of the bacteria. C. violaceum is a highly versatile, facultative anaerobic, soil- and water-borne free-living bacterium and therefore requires the largest genome size and gene number. The pathogenic Neisseria species are strictly aerobic bacteria with human as the only host and therefore require the smallest genome size and gene number. L. hongkongensis is a facultative anaerobic bacterium that can survive in human, freshwater fish and 0\u20132% NaCl but not in marine fish or \u22653% NaCl and therefore requires an intermediate genome size and gene number.",

This is compatible with its asaccharolytic phenotype and is consistent with other asaccharolytic bacteria, such as Campylobacter jejuni, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica, in that glucokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase are also absent from their genomes [18],[19]. On the other hand, the L. hongkongensis genome encodes the complete sets of enzymes for gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the glyoxylate cycle (Table S1). Similar to C. jejuni, the L. hongkongensis genome encodes a number of extracellular proteases and amino acid transporters. These amino acids can be used as carbon source for the bacterium. The genome encodes enzymes for biosynthesis of the 21 genetically encoded amino acids and for biosynthesis and \u03b2-oxidation of saturated fatty acids (Tables S2 and S3). The L. hongkongensis genome encodes a variety of dehydrogenases (LHK_00527\u201300540, LHK_01219\u201301224, LHK_02418\u201302421, LHK_00801\u201300803, LHK_01861, LHK_02912\u201302913 and LHK_00934) that enable it to utilize a variety of substrates as electron donors, such as NADH, succinate, formate, proline, acyl-CoA and D-amino acids. The presence of three terminal cytochrome oxidases may allow L. hongkongensis to carry out respiration using oxygen as the electron acceptor under both aerobic conditions [type aa3 oxidase (LHK_00169\u201300170, LHK_00173)] and conditions with reduced oxygen tension [type cbb3 (LHK_00995\u201300996, LHK_00998) and type bd (LHK_02252\u201302253) oxidases]. The genome also encodes a number of reductases [fumarate reductase (LHK_02340\u201302342), nitrate reductase (LHK_02079\u201302085), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) reductase (LHK_02496\u201302498) and tetrathionate reductase (LHK_01476\u201301478)], which may help carry out respiration with alternative electron acceptors to oxygen (fumarate, nitrate, DMSO and tetrathionate) under anaerobic conditions. This is supported by the enhanced growth of L. hongkongensis under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate (data not shown). Further studies are required to confirm if the bacterium can utilize other potential electron acceptors.",

            "text": "There were 441 transport-related proteins (13.6% of all CDSs) in the L. hongkongensis genome, comprising an extensive variety of transporters, which may reflect its ability to adapt to the freshwater fish and human intestines, and freshwater environments. According to the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) (http://www.tcdb.org/), all seven major categories of transporters are present in L. hongkongensis. Primary active transporters (class 3 transporters) were the most abundant class of transporters, accounting for 43.3% (191 CDSs) of all annotated CDSs related to transport, among which 104 belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily and 41 were oxidoreduction-driven transporters. Electrochemical potential-driven transporters (class 2 transporters) were the second most abundant class of transporters, accounting for 27.9% (123 CDSs) of all annotated CDSs related to transport, most of which (117 CDSs) are various kinds of porters including major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (19 CDSs), resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily (22 CDSs), amino acid-polyamine-organocation family (8 CDSs), dicarboxylate/amino acid\u2236cation symporter (DAACS) family (5 CDSs) and monovalent cation\u2236proton antiporter-2 family (3 CDSs), and various heavy metal transporters which may be involved in detoxification and resistance against environmental hazards. Three different types of class 2 transporters, belonging to the DAACS, tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter and C4-dicarboxylate uptake C family, are likely involved in the transport of malate, which can be used as the sole carbon source for L. hongkongensis in minimal medium [unpublished data]. The remaining class 2 transporters were ion-gradient-driven energizers belonging to the TonB family (6 CDSs). The third most abundant class of transporters was the channels and pores (class 1), with 39 CDSs including 12 \u03b1-type channels, 26 \u03b2-barrel porins. Among the 12 \u03b1-type channels, four were mechanosensitive channels which are important for mediating resistance to mechanophysical changes. The remaining transporters belong to four other classes, namely group translocators (class 4, 9 CDSs), transport electron carriers (class 5, 16 CDSs), accessory factors involved in transport (class 8, 9 CDSs) and incompletely characterized transport system (class 9, 54 CDSs). In line with their asaccharolytic nature, the genomes of L. hongkongensis and C. jejuni do not contain genes that encode a complete phosphotransferase system. The five families of multidrug efflux transporters, including MFS (6 CDSs), RND (8 CDSs), small multidrug resistance family (2 CDSs), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family (2 CDSs) and ABC transporter superfamily (5 CDSs), were all present in L. hongkongensis, which may reflect its ability to withstand toxic substances in different habitats [20]. 20 CDSs were related to iron metabolism, including hemin transporters, ABC transporters of the metal type and ferrous iron, iron-storage proteins and the Fur protein responsible for iron uptake regulation. In contrast to C. violaceum which produces siderophores for iron acquisition, but similar to the pathogenic Neisseria species, proteins related to siderophore formation are not found in L. hongkongensis genome. In addition to a TonB-dependent siderophore receptor (LHK_00497), a set of genes (LHK_01190, LHK_01193, LHK_01427\u20131428) related to the transport of hemin were present, suggesting that L. hongkongensis is able to utilize exogenous siderophores or host proteins for iron acquisition, which may be important for survival in different environments and hosts.",

A total of 47 CDSs are related to chemotaxis, of which 27 encode methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and 20 encode chemosensory transducer proteins. While most MCPs are scattered throughout the genome, the transducer proteins are mostly arranged in three gene clusters (Figure S1).

Unlike the genomes of C. violaceum and the pathogenic Neisseria species which encode genes involved in LuxR-I and LuxS/AI-2 systems respectively, the L. hongkongensis genome does not encode genes of these 2 systems. Instead, the AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine system, which is involved in inter-kingdom cross-signaling and regulation of virulence gene transcription and motility, best characterized in enterohemorrhagic E. coli\n[21],[22], is likely the predominant quorum-sensing mechanism used by L. hongkongensis. Several human enteric commensals or pathogens, including E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella, produce AI-3 [23]. A two-component system, QseB/C, of which QseC is the sensor kinase and QseB the response regulator, has been found to be involved in sensing AI-3 from bacteria and epinephrine/norepinephrine from host, and activation of the flagellar regulon transcription [21]. While the biosynthetic pathway of AI-3 has not been discovered, two sets of genes, LHK_00329/LHK_00328 and LHK_01812/LHK_01813, homologous to QseB/QseC were identified in the L. hongkongensis genome, suggesting that the bacterium may regulate its motility upon recognition of its host environment. The presence of two sets of QseB/QseC, one most similar to those of C. violaceum and the other most homologous to Azoarcus sp. strain BH72, is intriguing, as the latter is the only bacterium, with complete genome sequence available, that possesses two copies of such genes.",

In the L. hongkongensis genome, a cluster of genes, spanning a 12-kb region, related to acid resistance, is present. Similar to Helicobacter pylori, the L. hongkongensis genome contains a complete urease gene cluster (LHK_01035\u2013LHK_01037, LHK_01040\u2013LHK_01044), in line with the bacterium's urease activity. Phylogenetically, all 8 genes in the urease cassette are most closely related to the corresponding homologues in Brucella species (\u03b1-proteobacteria), Yersinia species (\u03b3-proteobacteria) and Photorhabdus luminescens (\u03b3-proteobacteria), instead of those in other members of \u03b2-proteobacteria, indicating that L. hongkongensis has probably acquired the genes through horizontal gene transfer after its evolution into a distinct species (Figure S3). Upstream and downstream to the urease cassette, adi (LHK_01034) and hdeA (LHK_01046) were found respectively. Their activities will raise the cytoplasmic pH and prevents proteins in the periplasmic space from aggregation during acid shock respectively [24],[25]. In addition to the acid resistance gene cluster, the L. hongkongensis genome contains two arc gene clusters [arcA (LHK_02729 and LHK_02734), arcB (LHK_02728 and LHK_02733), arcC (LHK_02727 and LHK_02732) and arcD (LHK_02730 and LHK_02731)] of the arginine deiminase pathway which converts L-arginine to carbon dioxide, ATP, and ammonia.

Comparison of the 2D gel electrophoresis patterns from L. hongkongensis HLHK9 cells grown at 20\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C revealed 12 differentially expressed protein spots, with 7 being more highly expressed at 20\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C and 5 being more highly expressed at 37\u00b0C than at 20\u00b0C (Table 2, Figure 3).

L. hongkongensis and wild type E. coli ATCC 25922, but not E. coli JW5553-1 (argB deletion mutant), grew in minimal medium without arginine, indicating that L. hongkongensis contains a functional arginine biosynthesis pathway. NAGK-20 is expressed at higher level at 20\u00b0C than 37\u00b0C, whereas NAGK-37 is expressed at higher level at 37\u00b0C than 20\u00b0C. Bacteria use either of two different pathways, linear and cyclic, for arginine biosynthesis. Similar to NAGK-20 of L. hongkongensis, NAGK of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Thermotoga maritima, which employ the cyclic pathway, can be inhibited by arginine as the rate-limiting enzyme for negative feedback control [34]\u2013[37]. On the other hand, similar to NAGK-37 of L. hongkongensis, NAGK of E. coli, which employs the linear pathway, is not inhibited by arginine [35],[36]. We speculate that L. hongkongensis can use different pathways with the two NAGK isoenzymes with differential importance at different temperatures of different habitats.",

The topology of the phylogenetic tree constructed using NAGK was similar to that constructed using 16S rRNA gene sequences (data not shown). This suggested that the evolution of argB genes in general paralleled the evolution of the corresponding bacteria, and argB gene duplication has probably occurred after the evolution of L. hongkongensis into a separate species. The requirement to adapt to different temperatures and habitats may have provided the driving force for subsequent evolution to 2 homologous proteins that serve in different environments. Notably, among all 465 bacterial species with complete genome sequences available, only Thermus thermophilus, Deinococcus geothermalis, Deinococcus radiodurans, Roseiflexus castenholzii and Roseiflexus sp. RS-1 possessed two copies of argB, whereas Anaeromyxobacter sp. Fw109-5 and Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans 2CP-C possessed one copy of argB and another fused with argJ (Figure 5). The clustering of argB in two separate groups in these bacteria suggests that argB gene duplication has probably occurred in their ancestor, before the divergence into separate species. The prevalence of T. thermophilus, Deinococcus species and Roseiflexus species in hot springs suggested that this novel mechanism of temperature adaptation may also be important for survival at different temperatures in other bacteria. Further experiments on differential expression of the two isoenzymes at different temperatures in these bacteria will verify our speculations.",

Briefly, 2 \u00b5l of cDNA was amplified in a 25 \u00b5l reaction containing 2.5 \u00b5l of 10\u00d7 TaqMan buffer A, 5.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.8 \u00b5M of each primer, 0.8 \u00b5M of gene-specific TaqMan probe with a 5\u2032-[6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM)] reporter dye and a 3\u2032-[6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)] quencher dye, 2.5 U of AmpErase Uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) and 0.625 U AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Primers and TaqMan probes were designed using Primer Express software, version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) (Table S4). Reactions were first incubated at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 min in duplicate wells. Reactions were then thermal-cycled in 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Absolute standard curve method was used for determination of transcript level for each gene. Standard curves were made by using serial dilutions from plasmids containing the target sequences with known quantities. Housekeeping gene RNA polymerase beta subunit, rpoB, was used as an internal control. Triplicate assays using RNAs extracted in three independent experiments confirmed that transcript levels of rpoB were not significantly different (P>0.05) at 20\u00b0C compared with 37\u00b0C (data not shown). The transcript levels of argB-20 and argB-37 were then normalized to that of rpoB. Triplicate assays using RNAs extracted in three independent experiments were performed for each target gene.",
