Metal-ion\u2013dependent enzymes (e.g. RNase P and RNase MRP) cleave single- and double-stranded RNA to produce RNA fragments with 5\u2032-phosphate and 3\u2032-hydroxyl termini. In contrast, metal-ion\u2013independent enzymes (e.g. RNase L, RNase A and IRE1) target single-stranded RNA exclusively, producing RNA fragments with 5\u2032-hydroxyl and 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate termini (Table 1). The specificity of metal-ion\u2013independent endoribonucleases for single-stranded sites in RNA is due in large part to the mechanism of RNA cleavage. A structurally flexible 2\u2032-OH, in the context of single-stranded RNA, functions as the nucleophile, resulting in the generation of the 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate at the site of RNA cleavage by metal-ion\u2013independent endoribonucleases.\n",

            "text": "Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is a well-studied endoribonuclease associated with lifespan (18), cancer (19,20), antibacterial defense (21) and antiviral defense (2,22,23). Based on its homology with IRE1 (24), a metal-ion\u2013independent enzyme that produces RNA fragments with 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate termini (1,25), RNase L is expected to produce RNA fragments with 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate termini (Table 1). RNase L cleaves host and viral RNAs predominantly at single-stranded UA and UU dinucleotides (26), although the structural context of UA and UU dinucleotides in RNA greatly impacts the magnitudes of cleavage by RNase L (27). Host and viral RNAs cleaved by RNase L function as ligands for RIG-I and MDA5 (28,29), amplifying type I interferon expression and antiviral responses. Several viruses encode mechanisms to directly counteract RNase L. Group C enteroviruses encode an RNA structure that functions as a competitive inhibitor of RNase L (30\u201333), whereas certain strains of coronavirus and rotavirus express a 2\u2032, 5\u2032-phosphodiesterase that destroys 2\u2032, 5\u2032-oligoadenylates [2-5A or px5\u2019A(2\u2019p5\u2019A)n; x = 1-3; n \u2265 2] (34,35), the allosteric activator of RNase L. Recently, the L* protein of Theiler\u2019s virus was shown to directly inhibit RNase L activity (36). Characteristic RNase L-dependent (37) and RNase L-independent (38) cleavage patterns are evident in ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) during virus infections; however, the precise cleavage sites in rRNAs have not been defined.",

We validated the methods using defined viral RNAs cleaved with purified RNase L and RNase A, as well as RNA from uninfected- and poliovirus (PV)-infected HeLa cells under conditions where RNase L was activated during the course of the virus infection (30). As described herein, we discovered discrete regions in HCV and PV RNA genomes that were profoundly susceptible to single-strand\u2013specific endoribonucleases, as well as regions that were largely resistant to cleavage by single-strand\u2013specific endoribonucleases. We identified a constellation of RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites in rRNAs and we mapped these cleavage sites onto the secondary and tertiary structures of the human 80S ribosome (42). In addition, we detected 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphates at the end of U6 snRNA, consistent with the enzymatic activity of C16orf57 (6,7). Lastly, and unexpectedly, our results suggest that 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphates are present at the end of 5S rRNA.",

Bovine pancreatic RNase A was obtained from Ambion. Viral RNAs (100 nM) were incubated at 30\u00b0C in reactions (50 \u00b5l of volume) containing cleavage buffer (25 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 7.4], 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 \u00b5M ATP, 7 mM \u03b2ME), RNase A (0.5 nM), or RNase L (25 nM), and 2-5A (25 nM). These reaction conditions were optimized empirically to give limited and increasing amounts of viral RNA cleavage over time. RNase A, even at relatively low concentrations, cleaved the viral RNAs readily (0.5 nM RNase A/100 nM viral RNA). Higher concentrations of RNase L (25 nM) were needed for optimal enzymatic activity, due in part to the required dimerization of RNase L following 2-5A binding (47). Increased amounts of RNase L (50 nM) and 2-5A (50 nM) were used in reactions containing PV RNA to overcome the competitive inhibitor of RNase L (30,32). Reactions were terminated after the indicated periods of time (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 min) with the addition of 150 \u00b5l of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) buffer (0.5% SDS, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 7.5], 1.25 mM EDTA [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl). After phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (P:C:I) extraction and ethanol precipitation, 2.5 \u00b5g of RNA from each reaction was fractioned by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose (MOPS-formaldehyde).

Pyrimidines were the most common nucleotides at the end of viral RNA fragments produced by RNase A (Figure 2), consistent with the known specificity of RNase A (52). RNase L and RNase A targeted single-stranded regions of viral RNA (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). A peak of cleavage was evident in the E2 gene of HCV RNA, with especially large amounts of RNase L cleavage at UA1755, UA4422 and UU4465 and especially large amounts of RNase A cleavage at UC1671, UC1682 and CU1754 (Figure 2A). Three independent peaks of cleavage were evident in PV RNA; region 1 (884\u20131042 nt), region 2 (1705\u20131827 nt) and region 3 (3088\u20133221 nt) (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S5). As highlighted in Supplementary Figure S5, UA961 was the most frequent RNase L cleavage site within region 1 (1108 UMI reads after 5 min of cleavage), UA1803 was the most frequent RNase L cleavage site within region 2 (4223 UMI reads after 5 min of cleavage) and UU3102 was the most frequent RNase L cleavage site within region 3 (5347 UMI reads after 5 min of cleavage).

This is most clearly presented in Supplementary Figure S4, focusing on four prominent RNase L cleavage sites in HCV RNA. The number of UMI-corrected cDNA reads at UA1755, UA4422, UU4465 and UU4466 increased coordinate with the time of incubation with RNase L (Supplementary Figure S4). Note that UU4465 and UU4466 are adjacent cleavage sites, where cleavage at UU4465 would preclude detectable cDNA reads at UU4466.

We previously established that RNase L activity, which requires 2-5A from dsRNA-activated oligoadenylate synthetase, is provoked during the course of PV infection in W12 HeLa cells, whereas RNase L activity remains undetectable during the course of PV infection in M25 HeLa cells (30). The kinetics and magnitudes of PV replication in W12 and M25 HeLa cells are similar (Figure 3A). When RNAs from the PV-infected cells were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, the accumulation of viral RNA was evident at 4\u20138 h post adsorption (hpa) (Figure 3B). rRNA fragments characteristic of RNase L activity were evident in RNAs from PV-infected W12 HeLa cells at 6 and 8 hpa, but these rRNA fragments were not detected in PV-infected M25 HeLa cells (Figure 3B, asterisks indicate the location of rRNA fragments characteristic of RNase L activity).\n",

One prominent RNase L-dependent cleavage site at UA1715 was evident in PV RNA isolated at 6 and 8 hpa from W12 HeLa cells (Figure 4A). A second potential RNase L-dependent cleavage site at UU3102 was evident in PV RNA isolated at 6 and 8 hpa from W12 HeLa cells (Figure 4A); however, there was substantial RNase L-independent cleavage at UU3102 in M25 HeLa cells (Figure 4C), making it uncertain as to the enzyme(s) responsible for cleavage at this site in cells. UA1715 and UU3102 are prominent RNase L cleavage sites identified using purified RNase L (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S5). Surprisingly, there were no other obvious RNase L-dependent cleavage sites in PV RNA isolated from W12 HeLa cells. The increased frequency of UA and UU dinucleotides in cDNAs from W12 HeLa cells at 6 and 8 hpa was consistent with the activation of RNase L at these times (compare Figure 4B and D). RNase L-independent cleavage sites in PV RNA from HeLa cells mapped to the same regions of PV RNA as the cleavage sites found using purified RNase L and RNase A, with notable peaks of cleavage in the 5\u2032-half of the open-reading frame (compare Figure 2B with Figure 4A and C). Potential reasons for these hypersensitive regions in PV RNA are considered in the discussion. Remarkably, PV cDNA reads from HeLa cells corresponded to cleavage sites exclusively within positive-strand RNA; no cDNA reads were found corresponding to cleavage sites within PV negative-strand RNA.\n",

The 8 base UMI sequence in RNA linkers, which corresponds to 65 536 unique molecules, allows for precise quantification of cleavage sites (49). UA1755, and a small number of other sites in HCV RNA, were consistently linked to large numbers of distinct RNA linkers (Figure 2A, Y-axis, UMI-corrected cDNA reads), whereas most other regions in HCV RNA were cleaved infrequently. These results are consistent with those obtained using primer extension (27); however, the quantitative data from 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing is more reliable than that obtained using primer extension. Quantitative analyses of RNase L cleavage sites in HCV RNA by primer extension were confounded by multiple factors: the use of multiple primers (30 primers across the HCV RNA genome), variable hybridization efficiencies for each primer and decreased sensitivity of cleavage site detection as the distance increased from the site of hybridization. In contrast, quantitative analyses of RNase L cleavage sites in HCV RNA using 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing are extremely precise. Because HCV RNAs from distinct genotypes have variably reduced frequencies of UA and UU dinucleotides (40), the potential role(s) of RNase L in HCV infections and interferon-based antiviral therapies deserves further examination now that a method has been developed to reliably detect and quantify RNase L cleavage sites in host and viral RNAs.",

The striking distribution of RNase L and RNase A cleavage sites in PV RNA (Figure 2B), with prominent amounts of cleavage in discrete regions of the genome, was not expected. The same discrete regions of PV RNA were targeted by endoribonucleases both in vitro (Figure 2B) and in vivo (Figure 4). Furthermore, one RNase L-specific cleavage site was reliably detected both in vitro and in vivo (Figures 2B and 4, UA1715 in PV RNA). We entertained two hypotheses as we considered these data. First, PV RNA may assume a secondary and tertiary structure that renders some portions of the genome particularly susceptible to single-strand\u2013specific endoribonucleases while rendering other regions resistant (Supplementary Figure S5). Second, antigenic variation in the capsid proteins, as a consequence of antibody selection, could render portions of the capsid genes more sensitive to cleavage by single-strand\u2013specific endoribonucleases, due to the counter-selective forces of antigenic variation and resistance to endoribonucleases (Supplementary Figure S6). The predicted secondary structures of HCV and PV RNAs do explain much of the data (55), as metal-ion\u2013independent endoribonucleases do not cleave dsRNA portions of viral RNA (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). In addition, atomic force microscopy of HCV and PV RNA genomes reveals globular structures, where some regions of the viral RNA genomes might be more exposed to endoribonucleases than others (56,57). Intriguingly, antibody neutralization escape mutations are found within and near endonuclease susceptible regions of PV RNA (58,59); however, the peaks of endonucleolytic cleavage in the PV capsid genes do not overlap exclusively with the location of RNA changes associated with antigenic variation (Supplementary Figure S6). A complete understanding of the discrete distribution of endoribonuclease cleavage sites in PV RNA awaits further investigation.",

Unlike many studies, which actively exclude rRNAs from deep sequencing experiments to enrich for other RNA populations, we intentionally retained rRNAs in our study to identify RNase L-dependent and RNase L-independent cleavage sites in rRNAs. Although we did not detect RNase L-dependent cleavage sites in 28S rRNA under the conditions of our experiment, others have reported RNase L-dependent cleavage of 28S rRNA (60,61). We did identify two RNase L-dependent cleavage sites in 18S rRNA, UU541 and UU743 (Figures 5B and 7A and B). Cleavage of 18S rRNA (1869 bases long) at these sites would produce rRNA fragments of 541, 743, 1126 and 1328 bases long, consistent with the characteristic rRNA fragments observed by agarose gel electrophoresis in this report (Figure 3B), and in previous studies by our lab and others (30,37). As expected for RNase L, the 18S rRNA cleavage sites, UU541 and UU743, are associated with single-stranded regions of 18S rRNA, on the surface of 80S ribosomes (Figure 7).",

The RNase L-independent cleavage sites of 28S rRNA occurred in core segments of the 28S rRNA, while little cleavage occurred in the GC-rich expansion segments (Figures 5A and 6A), despite the location of expansion segments on the surface of ribosomes (Figure 7). The paucity of cDNA reads in 28S rRNA expansion segments is likely due to the dsRNA-rich characteristics of expansion segments (42) (Supplementary Figure S13/dsRNA is resistant to metal-ion\u2013independent endoribonucleases) and to the reduced frequency of Illumina cDNA reads in GC-rich regions of RNA (62). The paucity of cDNA reads in rRNA expansion segments evident in our data (Figures 5 and 6) is similar to data from others (63).",

            "text": "The functional impact of rRNA cleavage at particular sites is yet to be determined. rRNA cleavage has been associated with RNase L-dependent (37) and RNase L-independent antiviral responses (38), ER-stress (64), apoptosis (65), oxidative stress (66) and the inhibition of translation during spermatogenesis (63). The RNase L cleavage sites identified in this investigation in 18S rRNA (UU541 and UU743) are distant from the mRNA decoding channel (Figure 7). It is unclear whether cleavage of 18S rRNA at these sites would affect translation. AG409 in 28S rRNA, one of the most prominent RNase L-independent cleavage sites in both uninfected and PV-infected HeLa cells (Figures 5A and 6A; Supplementary Figures S7 and S8 and Supplementary Table S4), is analogous to an oxidative stress-induced rRNA cleavage site identified in yeast (66). Yet again, there are no definitive data to indicate how cleavage of 28S rRNA at this site would affect translation. Nonetheless, because decreased translation is a common aspect of antiviral responses, ER-stress, apoptosis and oxidative stress, it is reasonable to speculate that cleavage of rRNAs at these sites might inhibit the translation activity of ribosomes. It is also important to consider the potential role of endonucleases in rRNA decay (67,68). RNase T2 has been implicated in rRNA decay pathways in plants (69) and vertebrates (70).",

Cyclic phosphates have been described at the 3\u2032-end of U6, 7SK and MRP RNAs, but not at the 3\u2032-end of 5S rRNA (71). Nonetheless, 5S rRNA was among the most common sequences detected in 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate cDNA libraries (Figure 3C and D and Supplementary Table S3), and almost all of the 5S rRNA signal was associated with the 3\u2032-end of mature 5S rRNA (Figures 5D and 6D and Supplementary Figure S12). The 3\u2032-ends of 5.8S and 5S rRNAs are on the surface of 60S ribosomal subunits (Figure 7C), consistent with the possibility that ribosomes contain RNAs with these terminal modifications. Alternatively, the mature 3\u2032-end of 5S rRNA, in the context of Mdmx complexes, could be modified with 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphates (72). Rex1p, a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease in the RNase D family, is involved with modifying the 3\u2032-ends of both 5S and 5.8S rRNA in yeast; however, RNase D family members are metal-ion\u2013dependent, and thus it is unlikely that a human homolog of Rex1p is responsible for the 2\u2032, 3\u2032-cyclic phosphate found at the end of these rRNAs (73,74).",

The cyclic phosphate at the 3\u2032-end of U6 snRNA facilitates interactions with Lsm proteins (75), which promote U6 snRNP maturation (8). Lsm proteins are also implicated in rRNA processing and maturation (76). Therefore, the cyclic phosphates found at the 3\u2032-ends of 5.8S and 5S rRNAs may contribute to their interaction with Lsm proteins and RNP maturation.",
