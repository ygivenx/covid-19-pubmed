The private sector mostly focused on urban areas providing the majority of advanced care services. The past decades were categorized by the enhanced capacity of the healthcare system and swiftly developing national health indicators including the increased rate of child immunization and infant mortality rate. However, the commencement of civil war led to the worsening of the healthcare sector through the broad destruction of facilities, shortage of medicines, and healthcare personnel along with lack of secure transportation and secure routes [1].",

The abrupt upsurge of refugee influx into these states has been a significant event that brought upon a severe negative impact on the world economy and ultimately generated strong economic and health pressures on Jordan [3].",

With the consideration of ongoing conflict in Syria as well as the nearby states, it is reflected that healthcare system in these zones has become one of the most defenseless and weak structures. It has been evaluated that healthcare facilities of Syria mostly involved the government public hospitals that focus and endow primary healthcare services, whereas private sectors are more inclined to provide advanced care services. The Syrian healthcare system has been incorporated throughout the civil warfare zone instead of endowing a secure region of health care and refuge [4]. Therefore, the study was aimed to examine the correlation between the Syrian crisis and the reemergence of infectious diseases in Jordan. The objectives primarily addressed the influence of Syrian conflict on infectious diseases, risks associated with the infectious diseases in Jordan, and status of infectious diseases in Jordan before the crisis, current situation, and future perspectives.",

Presently, Turkey is hosting the greatest number of Syrian refugees that is around 2.7 million [5]. Very few refugees are living in camps around the border, and others may be spread in Turkey. The unpredictable and explosive increase in Syrian population living in Turkey had negative influences on the social and health determinants. The lack of healthcare opportunities has enabled shortages in childhood immunization plans and less availability of clean water and food provisions. Approximately 7.5 million Syrians were found at outpatient clinics according to Ministry of Health data and 299,240 were hospitalized [5]. The hospitalized Syrians were mostly wounded and injured victims, who have been occupying intensive care units. The refugees commonly live in unsanitary and uncrowded conditions, which may lead to the spread of skin, respiratory, genital, and gastrointestinal infections. There are still many problems pending to be resolved for better living and health standards.",

One of the primary concerns has been the declining health status in these regions. The rising numbers of infectious diseases in the parallel years of migration have been one of the main parts of the major demographic transitions in the areas. For achieving the objective, the literature has focused on the records of Jordan. The transition, as observed in the days of migration, displayed a high shift in the mortality rates and modifications in conventional lifestyles of Syrian refugees in Jordan [9]. Several studies revealed a pattern of diversity in the utilization of healthcare facilities as pursued by care-seeking individuals among the host Jordanians and refugees [10, 11]. The review further focuses upon the spread of infections and put an attempt to identify any existing correlations.",

Other studies have demonstrated that the healthcare services have been severely declining in an incessant manner [13]. Before the emergence of the Syrian crisis and influx of infectious diseases in the state of Jordan, preexisting infections within this region were considered to be the dominant factor contributing to mortality. The causes of death were made compulsory to be recorded by the Ministry of Jordan; however, information in regard to the causes of mortality was insufficient and erratic [14]. In recent decades, a significant contribution has been made to control the reasons behind prevailing mortality rate that included measles, influenza, and malaria. Subsequent to the proper preventive measures and management, these epidemics have disappeared as considerable variables, influencing the mortality status of Jordan, have been employed [15]. It has been estimated that 630,000 Syrian refugees crossed borders of Jordan in October 2015 [16]. It has been observed that government of Jordan is in its midphase to control the entrance of refugees and overcome its impacts. However, no possible solution has been lined up yet to resolve the major debt crisis [17]. The economic adversity in Jordan has been attributed to the decision taken in favor of Syrian refugees. The population influx generated diverse burden on the economy. Likewise, high burden of noncommunicable diseases also occurred with higher prevalence rates throughout the refugee camps [15].",

Cookson et al. [23] further demonstrated that the rates of tuberculosis were high among the displaced persons, but increased detection is predictable. Higher rates of tuberculosis were observed among the Syrian refugees and would predictably persist as the Syrian crisis endures. Active screening is probable to detect tuberculosis earlier for the reduction of risk for transmission. However, this strategy requires justifiable funding to continue, and there is a need to realize more activities. A consistent Jordanian tuberculosis strategy was developed for the Syrian refugees, which has potential to control efforts and inform treatment for other regional nations influenced by the Syrian crisis [23]. According to Wells, the higher incidence rate of tuberculosis has been observed to be constructed over time that turned out to adhere with the Jordanian populace [24]. Syrian refugees, living in the state of crisis, have been found to be suffering from restriction regarding the cure of tuberculosis. The main factor behind the limitation is the inadequate availability of medical facilities. The inadequacy consequently accounts for the decrease in the treatment and management of the disease [25]. Furthermore, the decrease in the detection of the disease and lesser notification from the population is another reason for the higher prevalence of the disease among the Syrian refugees in Jordan [24, 26].",

Doocy et al. revealed that almost 40% infants and children have been detected with rotavirus in 2016 [10]. According to Richardsen et al. [32], diarrheagenic E. coli strains were considered to be the second most usual cluster detected among enteropathogens. The major reason for the emergence of infectious diseases has been indicated by the conventional Jordanian practice of utilizing cooked foods and boiled milk in the diet [33]. The infectious diseases, correlated with clinical symptoms, are presented with the most prevalent enteropathogens observed in Jordan. The clinical characteristics and collective predictive capacity of temperature were investigated to determine the association among existence of pathogens, particularly the diarrheal pathogens [33]. It has been identified that due to the fact that the etiologic agents are not helpful in diagnosing a large number of diarrheal patients, the undiagnosed illness might get classified from the enteropathogens [32].",

Nonetheless, as compared to other countries, the coverage rates have been lower in Jordan [34].

All efforts in Syria to rebuild the destroyed healthcare sector and quell humanitarian disasters will be greatly ineffective as long as the civil war endures to rage on. The end of war immediately is complex from efforts to control the global threat and spare the innocent lives from the infectious diseases. Healthcare circumstances are uncontrolled by the geopolitical borders, while the political borders of the conflict can be allocated. The spread of communicable diseases and refugees into Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon defines the prevailing consequences of the extended Syrian conflict. Additionally, the infections and diseases continue to influence the increasingly vulnerable population negatively. The international community has been insufficiently observed in response to the consequences of infectious diseases after the Syrian conflict. This failure may continue to increase until there are exhaustive and coordinated global efforts.",

It has been examined that advanced strategies have been developed to control the augmenting numbers of the infectious diseases. Major progress has been perceived in the healthcare services, while governance and coordination issues have been found to be on the verge of exposing the local populace in Jordan to the risk of contamination. The threat of major infectious diseases has been higher in extent as well as threatens an alarming medical situation in Jordan. Furthermore, the cost has been identified as a considerable constraint to the healthcare services in Jordan in spite of high levels of care-seeking. Development must also be made to control the disease surveillance along with the immunization coverage. Further strategies must be implemented to develop national policies and strong health promotion services to highlight prevention of infectious diseases among both the local population and sheltered refugees within the borders of the state.",
