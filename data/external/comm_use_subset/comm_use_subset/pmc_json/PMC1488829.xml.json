An association between viral upper-respiratory infections (URIs) and exacerbations of asthma has been reported [3,4]. The most commonly identified viruses in these studies include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5]. RSV is the predominant cause of URIs in infants below 2 years of age and infection may result in bronchiolitis, which is a risk factor for asthma [6-12]. RSV may constitute the earliest trigger for the development of a T-helper type 2 (Th2)-dominant immune response, which is the hallmark of immunopathology in allergic subjects including asthmatics, and also in rodent models [13]. URIs cause a decrease in peak flow that lags behind upper airway symptoms by 1\u20132 days, with 46% of subjects in one study reporting a two day lag in peak flow reduction [14].",

The combination is also significantly more effective than montelukast plus FP or monotherapy with inhaled budesonide [18]. The increased effectiveness of FPS has been attributed to increased activation and translocation to the nucleus of glucocorticoid receptors [19,20].

Since URIs induce exacerbations, \u03b22-agonists may be of specific value in reducing such exacerbations. In an in vitro study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, a combination of FP and Sal reduced infection and preserved ciliated cells to a greater degree than either alone suggesting synergy between the two agents [22]. Because 80\u201385% of asthma exacerbations in children are associated with viral infections, early intervention with a combination therapy should have beneficial effects on viral asthma exacerbations.",

This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of allergen sensitization and RSV infection using OVA as the allergen [1]. Mice with chronic or acute sensitization to OVA were RSV infected and then treated with FP or Sal or the two together (FPS). Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and pulmonary inflammation were measured five days after infection.

Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 in panel A and with OVA in panel B. FP increased the number of cells producing IL-10 and Sal increased cells producing IL-4, whereas FPS decreased the number of cells producing IL-10, IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3. Lung epithelial cells respond to inflammatory cytokines by expressing specific cell markers such as the intracellular adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, and the mucin gene, MUC-5A. Fig. 4 shows the results of an immunohistochemical analysis for ICAM-1 and Muc-5A in mouse lung sections. RSV infection increased the expression of ICAM-1 and mucin, whereas treatment with FPS decreased their expression compared to control mice. Another correlate of lung inflammation is the infiltration of T lymphocytes into the perialveolar tissue. A Th2-specific marker, T1/ST2, was used to stain lung sections, and both Sal and FPS appear to stimulate infiltration of T cells of the Th2 type into the lung (lower panel, Fig. 4).",

These results are in agreement with previous reports, where steroid or \u03b22-agonists alone was found to be partially effective in RSV infection and viral induced asthma [24-26]. Consistent with the AHR data, there was a substantial reduction in pulmonary inflammation irrespective of the frequency of RSV infection. Of note is that in experiments where mice sensitized with OVA received one RSV infection, there was a decrease in eosinophils but an increase in lymphocytes. In contrast, OVA-sensitized mice that had two RSV infections before FP showed an increase in neutrophils. This is probably due to the resistance of neutrophils to corticosteroids and to the generation of a greater number of infiltrating neutrophils by the repeated RSV infection. The former possibility is consistent with the findings that neutrophilic asthma is resistant to treatment by FP [27]. This suggests that addition of the long-acting beta agonist is the agent primarily affecting recruitment of neutrophils in the combination.",

Mice with a single infection showed an increased percentage of IL-10-producing cells perhaps indicative of greater stimulation of the innate immune system [29]. Treatment with salmeterol alone resulted in a significantly higher percentage of IL-4-producing cells characteristic of the Th2-type response observed in human infants suffering from acute RSV bronchiolitis [30] while FPS decreased both IL-10 and IL-4. The numbers of cytokine-producing cells in splenocyte cultures are in agreement with the increased number of Th2-like cells seen in lung sections from salmeterol-treated mice. In mice infected twice with RSV, FPS reduced IL-10 but not IL-4 compared to FP or salmeterol alone-. This is consistent with our previous finding that allergic mice with two RSV infections had an increase in the number of cells producing IL-4 and IL-13 [1].
