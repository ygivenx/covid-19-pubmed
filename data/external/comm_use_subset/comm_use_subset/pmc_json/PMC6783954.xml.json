MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory symptoms accompanied by high fever, cough, and severe pneumonia, and mortality rates can be as high as 35% [3]. The overall risk in areas outside Saudi Arabia, the country in which most of the cases have been reported, remains as significant as inside Saudi Arabia, and thus novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed.",

MERS-CoV is an enveloped RNA virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes structural proteins including the spike (S) protein and the nucleocapsid protein (NP) [4]. Like all coronaviruses, the S protein, present on the surface of the MERS-CoV virion, plays a critical role in the viral entry into host cells [5,6]. The S protein consists of two non-covalently associated subunits, S1 and S2, and trimerizes to form a prefusion spike [7,8,9]. Upon entry of the virus into cells, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit recognizes the host cell receptors dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) or CD26 [10,11,12], while the S2 subunit has a role in viral fusion with host cell membranes through the interplay of two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and a transmembrane domain on the S2 subunit [6,13].",

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are rapidly emerging as an alternative approach complementing vaccines against viral infections [14]. Due to its critical role in the interaction with host cell receptors, tremendous efforts have been focused on the discovery of neutralizing mAbs against the RBD of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit [15,16,17,18]. Strategies have included phage or yeast display library selection; immunization of animals, such as humanized mice and dromedary camels; and antibody isolation from human survivors of MERS-CoV infection. However, a drawback of the mAbs is their costly and time-consuming production in mammalian cell lines. Moreover, viruses can easily evolve to generate RBD variants with mutations that avoid immune responses [19,20]. However, such mutations are less common in the S2 subunit, which makes it an attractive target for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, the first MERS-CoV S2 subunit (MERS-S2P)-targeting antibody, called G4, was generated using mouse immunization and was demonstrated to recognize a variable loop in the S2 connector domain and to neutralize infection by the virus [13,21].",

Therefore, the importance of developing reliable diagnostic tests is rapidly becoming clear to manage and control a viral spread. Indeed, various diagnostic tests have been developed since the first description of the virus. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), accompanied with viral RNA sequencing, is the primary method used to detect viral infection, although there are obvious limitations of this test such as a long turnaround time [1,22,23,24,25,26,27]. Serological tests relying on antibodies specific to viral antigens, such as the NP, can also be used by either capturing viral antigens through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) [28,29,30] or by detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies through ELISA, indirect fluorescence antibody assay (IFA), Western blotting, and neutralization assays [31,32,33,34,35].

Briefly describing the MERS-S2P production, MERS-S2P (amino acids 752-1288 amino acids), tagged with C-terminal 6\u00d7 His, was expressed in insect Sf9 cells by using a recombinant baculovirus (AB vector, San Diego, CA, USA) and was purified using HisTrap HP Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). Briefly, to perform panning, t MERS-S2P was immobilized in immunotubes (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C for 18 h. After rinsing twice with tap water, the immunotubes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (RT). At the same time, the phage library was incubated in 2% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at RT. Blocked phages were transferred to the immunotubes coated with MERS-S2P and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C before washing three times with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Bound phages were eluted from immunotubes with 100 mM triethylamine for 10 min at RT, followed by neutralization with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Neutralized eluted phages were transferred to mid-log-phase Escherichia coli (E. coli) TG1 cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with gentle rotation (120 rpm). The infected TG1 cells were spread on 2\u00d7 YT agar plates supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin, and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The colonies were collected via scraping with 6 mL of 2\u00d7 YT medium. A total of 50 mL of 2\u00d7 YT supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin were inoculated with the scraped cells to yield an OD600, the optical density at 600 nm, of 0.05 to 0.1 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (220 rpm) until the OD600 reached 0.5. Then, the culture was infected with VCSM13 helper phage, a derivative of M13KO7 helper phage (provided by Dr. Hong from Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea) at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1. After incubation for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with gentle rotation (120 rpm), kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 70 \u03bcg/mL and the culture was grown overnight at 30 \u00b0C with shaking (220 rpm). Cells were then centrifuged at 24,793\u00d7 g for 30 min and the supernatant was passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. Phage particles were precipitated using one-fifth of the volume of the precipitation buffer (20% Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 15% NaCl) for 30 min on ice. The precipitated phages were pelleted using centrifugation at 24,793\u00d7 g for 30 min and resuspended in PBS. The phage suspension was used for the next round of panning. For stringent selections, the number of washing steps was gradually increased and the amount of antigen for immobilization was decreased: first round\u201410 \u03bcg/mL, second round\u20145 \u03bcg/mL, and third round\u20142.5 \u03bcg/mL in PBS (1 mL).",

For kinetic studies, S2A3 (IgG) and S2D5 (IgG) at concentrations ranging from 0.59 nM to 9.38 nM were diluted in HBS-EP+ buffer (GE Healthcare). The experiments were performed at 25 \u00b0C with an association time of 3 min and a dissociation time of 5 min at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/min. After each binding cycle, a regeneration solution (10 mM glycine, pH 1.5) was injected for 1 min at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/min to remove any non-covalently bound protein. Signal detection was at a rate of 10 signals per second. Binding constants were determined using a 1:1 binding model and the BIA Evaluation software version 1.0 (GE Healthcare).",

To address this, the 14 clones were further analyzed using phage ELISA on recombinant S proteins from SARS-CoV and hCoV-HKU1 (see Materials and Methods). The results showed that the Fabs did not bind other CoV spike proteins, and were monospecific to the MERS-S2P (Figure 1B). By analyzing CDR sequences of the 14 clones, three unique Fab clones (S2A3 (Fab), S2A6 (Fab), and S2D5 (Fab)) were identified. One clone, S2A6 (Fab), was dominantly selected via panning (86% of sequences), while the other two clones (S2A3 (Fab) and S2D5 (Fab)) were present at lower frequencies (7% each) (Figure 1C).

This suggests that its abnormal retention time on the size-exclusion chromatography seems not due to the degradation of S2A6 (Fab) protein leading to smaller fragments but rather due to its aggregating, sticky nature. The melting temperatures (Tm, \u00b0C) of the Fab proteins were measured using a protein thermal shift (PTS) assay. The results showed that S2A3 (Fab) was the least stable with a Tm of 61.5 \u00b0C, while S2A6 (Fab) and S2D5 (Fab) had higher Tm values (80.4 \u00b0C and 78.2 \u00b0C, respectively) (Figure 2C and Table 1).

To address this, we performed a \u201cproof of concept\u201d study based on a sandwich immunoassay using the ACCEL ELISA\u2122 system, a rapid and sensitive ELISA system developed by Plexense Inc.

            "text": "We report the selection of human mAbs specific to the MERS-CoV S2 subunit (MERS-S2P) using a human synthetic Fab phage display library. Phage display is a powerful tool that has been used for both the discovery of, and therapeutic applications against, infectious diseases [14,18,39,40]. In particular, phage display has been demonstrated to be highly effective for the selection of human antibodies against MERS-CoV, mostly in na\u00efve human antibody phage display formats generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [18]. Although, in general, human mAbs targeting the RBD of the S1 subunit have higher neutralizing potencies than those targeting other regions of the S protein, such as HR1 on the S2 subunit, it is still necessary to combine human mAbs that recognize different neutralizing epitopes due to the emergence of viruses carrying RBD mutations [19,20]. Mouse G4 mAb is the only mAb demonstrated to bind MERS-S2P with an affinity of 8.9 nM and to neutralize infection of pseudo-MERS-CoV bearing S protein [21]. Recently, it was revealed that the G4 mAb recognizes the connector domain present between the HR1 and HR2 domains of the S2 subunit. This region is variable in sequence and length among betacoronaviruses [13]. Although the two anti-MERS-S2P mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) selected from our phage display library failed to neutralize infection by MERS-CoV (data not shown), these represent the first human antibodies targeting MERS-S2P selected from a human synthetic phage display library. Moreover, they had desirable biophysical properties in terms of affinity, thermal stability, and non-aggregation, which are essential for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. Furthermore, the reformatting of the Fabs to IgGs highly increased their apparent affinity (KDapp) to MERS-S2P, seemingly due to the avidity effect. Thus, these antibodies represent valuable additional S2 subunit-targeting mAbs and it should be interesting to reveal where they bind on the S2 subunit through a structural study, which is currently ongoing.

            "text": "Based on the sub-nM apparent affinity of S2A3 (IgG) and its specificity to MERS-CoV, we tried to develop an anti-MERS-S2P-based antibody capture ELISA for the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Once again, this is the first ELISA-based assay employing an anti-MERS-S2P mAb. The ELISA was tested using ACCEL ELISA\u2122 (Plexense Inc.), which is a rapid and sensitive ELISA system in which each well of the ELISA plate is stacked with layers such that the surface area of the well is increased. This results in higher ELISA signals because more protein is immobilized on the surface, and also enables faster development (<20 min) with a smaller amount of reagents (\u224815 \u03bcL) due to the effects of stacking. Indeed, our proof of concept study with S2A3 (IgG), MERS-S2P and rabbit polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV IgGs demonstrated a detection limit of 0.33 ng/mL (\u22485 fmol/mL). Previously, we have tested S2D5 (Fab) to determine the feasibility of using this mAb on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) designed to capture MERS-S2P. We observed that the mAb worked effectively on the PAD and the detection limit for MERS-S2P was approximately 10.4 nM (\u2248160 fmol/mL) [41]. Due to the lack of MERS-S2P-based detection assays that are comparable with ours, it is not possible to evaluate our results directly. However, it is still possible to compare our results indirectly with those obtained from detection assays performed using nucleocapsid protein (NP) through an antigen capture ELISA-based method or an immunochromatographic test (ICT) [28,30]. Similar to SARS-CoV, the NP protein is preferable as a target to the S protein in MERS, simply due to the presence of a higher copy number of the NP protein than the S protein [30]. According to the previous NP-based studies, a recombinant NP capture ELISA-based method showed detection limits of 0.625 ng/mL (\u224813.6 fmol/mL) and of 5 ng/mL (\u2248108.7 fmol/mL) using an ICT [30], while another capture ELISA yielded a detection limit of 1 ng/mL (\u224821.7 fmol/mL) [28]. This highlights the fact that our MERS-S2P-based ACCEL ELISA\u2122 system performed better than previously developed methods, even though the target protein is different. Studies are currently underway to demonstrate whether the MERS-S2P-based ACCEL ELISA\u2122 can feasibly detect virions in anti-MERS-CoV serum, and if so, to identify the detection limit in TCID50/mL (TCID50, 50% tissue culture infective dose). This should provide a direct comparison with the NP capture ELISA-based assays. It would also be interesting to perform an ACCEL ELISA\u2122 with anti-NP mAbs to compare their performance in a more quantitative way.",

A drawback of this strategy is that, in general, antibodies against the virus appear within 10 days of the onset of illness; therefore, antibodies might fall behind the detection of viral genomic material using molecular methods such as RT-PCR [42]. Thus, the MERS-S2P-based ACCEL ELISA\u2122 assay should be performed in combination with molecular methods, thereby detecting the viral genome as the front line of the diagnosis, such that viral infection can be diagnosed by molecular methods using lower respiratory tract samples where the viral load is high. Later, or in case these methods fail to detect viral genomes in the respiratory samples, the MERS-S2P-based ELISA assay, alone or possibly in combination with an NP-based antigen capture assay, can be applied to confirm and diagnose viral infection. Another point to address in this strategy is that since our anti-MERS-S2P mAbs are human antibodies, they should be dehumanized to avoid false positives due to their binding to the secondary anti-human antibodies before they are applied in the assay. Given the high titers of antibodies against MERS-CoV in over 95% of adult dromedaries, the immediate reservoir for the MERS-CoV transmission to humans, namely the Middle East [43,44,45], the present MERS-S2P-based antibody capture ELISA may be potentially useful for detecting MERS-CoV in dromedary animal samples. It may also be useful for screening other animal samples for MERS-CoV as long as secondary antibodies detecting the animal-derived anti-MERS-S2P antibodies are available. ",
