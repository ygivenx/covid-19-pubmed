            "text": "From 2013 to 2015, three major outbreaks of a newly-emerged avian influenza A (H7N9) virus occurred in China, creating a serious human health threat [1\u20133]. The first outbreak of the deadly infectious disease took place in Shanghai [1], and then occurrences spread to eastern, northern, and southern China [3] and far west areas such as Xinjiang [4]. By the end of 2015, China had reported a total of 667 H7N9 human cases with 269 deaths from over 15 provinces [5]. Most patients suffered from severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [6]. The clinical manifestation of H7N9 was worse than previous human H7 cases where mild/moderate cases were reported [7]. Some H7N9 cases reported a history of exposure to live poultry [8], leading to immediate suspicion of an avian reservoir as the origin of human infections. Avian-origin was further proven by Gao et al. [6] who used polymerase-chain-reaction assays, viral culturing, and sequence analyses to confirm the association between human infectious cases and reassortant H7N9 viruses. Risk factors for zoonotic H7N9 infection included physical contact with infected poultry or breathing in of contaminated aerosols/droplets [9]. Common physical contact included slaughtering, defeathering, or preparing sick poultry for cooking, handling diseased or dead poultry, and consuming raw or undercooked fowl products [10].",

            "text": "This emerging avian influenza virus threatens human health in Guangdong, which is one of the provinces that have had H7N9 confirmed cases. From 2013 to 2015, Guangdong experienced severe H7N9 outbreaks, and coping strategies were launched in late 2014 after risk factors concerning the disease outbreak were studied. By the end of 2015, a total of 183 cases with 67 deaths were reported by the Health Department of Guangdong Province [11]. A risk factor of concern was the Cantonese preference for shopping at live-poultry markets for live fowl or its products [12]. Cantonese residents are the original or native-born residents in Guangdong and this population sub-group shares a similar culture, dietary habits, and social preferences when compared with populations in other parts of China [13]. Live fowl was usually slaughtered on site or brought back for home slaughter as Cantonese commonly believe that live poultry slaughtered upon purchase preserves freshness and flavour [14]. Live-poultry markets therefore play a crucial role in poultry-to-human transmission [15]. To validate this point, researchers have isolated H7N9 from environmental swab samples collected at live-poultry markets [16]. Laboratory tests then further confirmed avian influenza A virus\u2019s ability to sustain, replicate, and disseminate at these markets [17, 18]. Clinical and epidemiological results indicated that live-poultry markets serve as a possible reservoir for avian influenza virus [15] and have placed market workers [19] as well as consumers at risk for contracting the avian influenza virus [16]. Due to the severity of H7N9 outbreaks in 2013\u20132014, the local preference for purchasing live fowl, and the high risk of virus exposure, the government of Guangdong Province announced a new policy on the central slaughtering of live poultry in late 2014. The Central Slaughtering of Live Poultry Policy (CSLPP) was officially set to take effect in the 21 cities in Guangdong Province on January 15, 2015 [20]. The CSLPP is a comprehensive policy combining several previously-proven biosecurity measures with some unconfirmed measures. Though policy regulations are consistent across the entire province, their implementation is determined by prefecture-level governments. Implementation priorities are given to the cities within the Pearl River Delta region to set \u2018Leadership Cities\u2019 for the whole province (Fig. 1). However, broader knowledge of influential factors of attitudes toward policy is lacking at prefecture levels and thus it is important to address these issues before further implementation of the CSLPP is carried out. General information on the CSLPP can be found in Table 1 and on the government website [20].\n\n",

In sampling consumers, we adopted both field and online recruitment (Additional file 1: Table S1). Field surveys were carried out in Guangzhou, Foshan, and Shenzhen, where we deployed our trained interviewers at market entrances and randomly selected consumers as they entered. The markets were also randomly selected. Consumers were asked if they or their family had purchased live poultry before (screening question). We further investigated consumers who gave a positive reply and expressed willingness to participate in the survey. To recruit consumers in other cities, notices about the questionnaire were posted on WeChat, including a link to an external survey website where participants were able to click on and fill out the questionnaire. The trained interviewers used the same screening question above to identify potential participants in their chat-groups and randomly selected target participants. They sent WeChat notices to target participants. Interviewers also provided online survey instructions to participants to ensure the validity of the online surveys. In the end, 1506 consumers completed questionnaires, but only 1449 (96.2%) consumers lived in the selected cities and were thus considered appropriate for analysis.",

The third dimension explored the perceptions of the CSLPP including whether they had heard of the CSLPP and the source of their hearing about the policy. Other questions, depending on their respondent type, were included for background information on their perception with the CSLPP. The final dimension assessed influential factors on attitudes toward the CSLPP. The whether-or-not questions were either binary (yes/no) or ternary (yes/no/no idea).

Finally, poultry farm workers tended not to support if they: a) experienced a drop in trading volume; b) operated a poultry farm on a small to medium scale, and c) experienced inconvenience to their work due to the policy.\n",
