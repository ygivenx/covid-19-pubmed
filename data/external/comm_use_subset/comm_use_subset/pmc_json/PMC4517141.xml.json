The viral RNA is translated into a single polyprotein which is processed by cellular and viral proteases into three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane, and envelope) and the seven non-structural (NS) proteins NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 [1]. The NS proteins are not found in the mature virion but are crucial for viral replication. Synthesis of viral RNA takes place in replication complexes (RCs) that contain essential NS proteins, viral RNA and host cell factors [2]. Upon DENV infection, a complex and continuous network of ER membrane-derived vesicular structures and convoluted membranes is formed. These structures contain the viral replication complexes and the sites of virion assembly [3,4,5].",

Expression of NS4A lacking the 2k fragment alone is sufficient to induce membrane alterations that resemble the DENV-induced highly curved membranes that harbor the RCs [1]. Clearly, to induce these structures NS4A will have to closely interact with host membranes. However, the mechanism by which NS4A induces the curved morphology of these newly formed membranes is still unknown. Insertion of amphipathic helices into one leaflet of a membrane bilayer, as well as oligomerization of membrane proteins are among the mechanisms known to participate in the induction of membrane curvature [7]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that pTMS2 of NS4A could support membrane undulations upon stable association with the membrane [8]. Curved vesicular structures might also be induced via homooligomerization of NS4A [9,10]. While we have previously shown that the NS4A N-terminal cytoplasmic region is implicated in its oligomerization [10], a recent study demonstrated that pTMS1 is the major determinant in this process [9]. Introduction of two point mutations at the N-terminal of NS4A (L6E and M10E) reduced both the amphipathic character of this region and NS4A homooligomerization and abolished viral replication [10].",

Direct interaction of NS4A with the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was reported to be necessary for correct localization of the RC at the perinuclear site [11]. The vimentin binding site was found to be located at the N-terminal 50 residues of NS4A [11]. NS4A was also reported to bind NS4B, another component of the RC, via pTMS1 [9]. Mutational analysis suggests a functional relevance of this interaction for viral replication [9]. It was speculated that the interaction between NS4A and NS4B in concert with NS4A oligomerization and NS4B dimerization may play a role in the spatial and temporal regulation of distinct molecular complexes involved in the viral infection cycle [9].",

POPC bilayers have a mass density very close to 1 g\u00b7cm\u22123 [24] at room temperature. Thus, POPC liposomes will migrate to the top layer containing the lowest sucrose concentration in a step gradient of decreasing sucrose concentrations upon centrifugation. In contrast, a small protein of ~5 kDa molecular weight is expected to have a mass density well above 1.41 g\u00b7cm\u22123 [25] and thus will accumulate in a sucrose rich layer of high mass density. Alexa-488-labeled NS4A(1\u201348) apparently binds to small sonicated POPC liposomes and migrates with the liposomes to the top of the gradient (Figure 1A). In contrast, the mutated peptide NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E) remains in the high density layer with 35% (w/v) sucrose even after 14 h of centrifugation (Figure 1B), indicating that this peptide does not bind to liposomes. As a negative control, the Alexa-488 free dye was loaded to the 35% (w/v) sucrose layer with POPC liposomes. The free dye remained in the high-density region after centrifugation (Figure 1C) indicating a lack of association with the POPC SUVs. The fluorescent band of the free dye has a larger vertical extension than that of the labeled NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E) after 14 h of centrifugation (Figure 1B,C). This probably reflects the larger diffusion coefficient of the low molecular weight dye molecule (643.4 g\u00b7mol\u22121). In a second control experiment Alexa-488-labeled NS4A(1-48) was loaded to the 35% (w/v) sucrose layer without adding POPC liposomes. As expected, the peptide did not significantly migrate during the 14 h of centrifugation and remained almost completely in the 35% (w/v) sucrose layer (Figure 1D). The floatation results confirm the binding of the wild type peptide to small liposomes.",

The hydrodynamic radius of the POPC liposomes was ~26 nm based on DLS measurements. Backbone cross peaks for most of the 48 amino acid residues of NS4A(1\u201348) were identified in buffer without liposomes except for S1, L2, P14, M17, H32, N42 and H43. The observed cross peaks characterize the free peptide conformation. Addition of increasing amounts of sonicated POPC liposomes at constant peptide concentration caused gradual peak intensity reductions in a peptide region specific manner (Figure 2A). Interestingly, peak positions did not significantly change, except for R12, which showed a small shift. Such a behavior is typical for slow or intermediate exchange of the peptide between the free and liposome-bound state. Strongest peak intensity reduction is observed in the N-terminal region extending up to K20 (Figure 2A). Some peaks in this region completely disappear already at 2.5 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 POPC (N5, I7, E9, G11, K20) while the others are reduced to less than 40%. At the highest liposome concentration studied (10 mg\u00b7mL\u22121) only two cross peaks from this peptide region remain visible and show low intensity. It is likely, that a number of amino acid residues of the N-terminal region bind directly to the liposome. Binding will change the chemical environment and strongly reduce the rotational correlation time of the amino acid residues in direct contact with lipids. NMR signals of bound residues are likely broadened beyond detection. Exchange dynamics may differ somewhat among the amino acid residues in this region, explaining the variable intensity reduction of the free state cross peaks.",

Different scenarios might contribute to the reduction of the free state peak intensities. Peptides that are anchored with their N-terminal region in the liposome might retain their free state conformation in the central domain, albeit with a reduced overall rotational correlation time and thus lower peak intensities. In addition, amino acid residues of the central region of some NS4A peptides might bind directly to the liposome leading to the disappearance of the corresponding NMR signals. The uniform peak intensity reduction pattern in the central region may suggest a concerted binding of this amino acid stretch, e.g., as one secondary structure element, to the liposome.",

Almost no peak reduction is observed for the C-terminal region of NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E).

Furthermore, these mutations had a similar effect when inserted as single mutations [10]. We have previously shown that NS4A(1\u201348) interacts preferentially with highly curved liposomes. CD spectroscopy demonstrated that these two point mutations severely compromise this interaction [12]. The interaction of wild type NS4A(1\u201348) with highly curved membranes has been demonstrated for three different lipid compositions, i.e., pure POPC, a POPC/DOPS mixture at a molar ratio of 4:1, and a blend of synthetic lipids resembling the composition of membranes in the ER (ER lipid mix), but no dependence on lipid composition was detected [12]. Here, we confirm these results using a liposome floatation assay and NMR. Initial floatation experiments were conducted with pure POPC and with the ER lipid mix. Again, no influence of lipid composition on NS4A(1\u201348) binding was observed. The detailed analysis presented in the current manuscript was conducted with single component POPC SUVs. Liposome floatation experiments (Figure 1) clearly show that wild type NS4A(1\u201348) binds to highly curved POPC liposomes, this interaction was not observed with the mutant peptide. The interaction between NS4A(1\u201348) and liposomes was further characterized using NMR. These experiments indicate that the main lipid binding sites of the peptide are located at the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of NS4A(1\u201348). Residues A21 through L31 may also be involved in liposome binding while the remaining C-terminal residues are only weakly affected by liposome binding and do not seem to play a direct role in this process. The backbone resonance assignment of NS4A(1\u201348) and NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E) reported in this manuscript contains information on the secondary structure of the two peptides in lipid-free buffer. Analysis with the TALOS-N software [26] clearly shows the lack of secondary structure for both peptides in buffer. The NMR data on NS4A(1\u201348) recorded in presence of liposomes do not allow any straightforward conclusion on the structure of the liposome-bound peptide. However, interaction of NS4A(1\u201348) with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles induces the formation of two amphipathic helices (AH) encompassing residues N5 to E9 (AH1) and T15 to L31 (AH2) of NS4A(1\u201348) [12]. CD spectra of NS4A(1\u201348) recorded in presence of either SDS micelles or small POPC liposomes are very similar [12]. Therefore, it is conceivable that the two amphipathic helices AH1 and AH2 are also formed in the liposome-bound peptide. The N-terminal region of NS4A(1\u201348) that forms AH1, an interhelical linker and the N-terminal half of AH2 in SDS micelles seem to be crucial for peptide binding to liposomes. Interestingly, this region also contains the two mutations L6E and M10E, which abolished liposome binding in the floatation experiment (Figure 1). Moreover, mutagenesis of other residues in this region including P14A [10], R12A and K20A [9] was also shown to reduce or abolish DENV replication.",

A comparatively weak NMR signal intensity reduction is observed for both the N-terminal and central regions of NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E) (Figure 2B) indicating some residual interaction with liposomes. However, the liposome floatation assay clearly shows that this interaction of the mutant peptide with POPC liposomes is too weak for stable anchoring of the peptide at the membrane. The amino acid sequence of A21 through L31 is identical in both peptides. We conclude that this amino acid stretch A21 to L31 is not sufficient for stable membrane anchoring of NS4A(1\u201348).",

The N-terminal region of the cytosolic domain specifically binds to the convex surface of highly curved membranes [12] and may serve as a second membrane anchor. Therefore, one hypothesis might be that NS4A can bridge two adjacent membranes or connect separate patches of the same membrane that come into close proximity due to membrane convolution. We speculate that membrane bridging by NS4A might play a crucial role in stabilizing the complex morphology of DENV-induced ER-derived membrane structures, which include stacks of convoluted membranes (CM), double membrane vesicles and tubes [5]. The vesicles were described as invaginations of the ER, which are connected to the cytosol via pore-like openings [5]. NS4A may play different roles in the reorganization of these ER-derived membranes. Asymmetric insertion of pTMS2 into the luminal leaflet of the inner membrane of the vesicles as well as oligomerization of NS4A may induce concave membrane curvature required for vesicle formation [7]. Binding of the N-terminal region of NS4A to the saddle-shaped neck region connecting the vesicle and the pore may further stabilize the vesicular structures.",

However, the source of the membranes and the nature of the modifications vary (for review see [2]). In general, the role of these modifications is twofold; to provide a scaffold concentrating and correctly positioning the viral and host factors for efficient viral replication and to protect the replicating virus from detection by the host immune system. The mechanisms driving the formation of these structures are still incompletely understood. Convoluted membranes are a form of membrane modification induced by several positive-strand RNA viruses including, in addition to DENV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Kunjin virus (KUNV) [5,27,28], for example. In KUNV convoluted membranes are thought to be the site of polyprotein processing [27]. While in DENV the role of these structures is still unclear, they are thought to be a depot for factors required for replication [5].",
