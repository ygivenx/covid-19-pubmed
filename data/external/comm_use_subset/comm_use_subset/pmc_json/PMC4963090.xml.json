Young children and the elderly are especially at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection resulting in extensive morbidity and over 3.4 million hospitalizations per year [2\u20134]. The development of an RSV vaccine is thus a priority. To date, the most potently RSV-neutralizing antibodies recognize the RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein [5]. RSV F is a type I fusion glycoprotein, comprising an F0 precursor which is activated by furin cleavage to form a prefusion (pre-F) trimer of disulfide-linked F2 and F1 heterodimers [6]. The pre-F conformation of RSV F undergoes substantial structural rearrangements as it transitions to the post-fusion conformation, as part of its essential role in merging viral and host cell membranes during entry.",

            "text": "Among several antigenic sites on RSV F associated with neutralizing activity [7\u201312], antigenic site \u00d8, located at the membrane distal end of pre-F (head region), is recognized by several of the most potent RSV-neutralizing antibodies thus far identified [9, 13, 14] and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies elicited in RSV-infected humans [15]. As antigenic site \u00d8 is only present on the pre-F conformation of RSV F, and recombinant pre-F spontaneously rearranges to the post-fusion conformation [9], several variants of RSV F stabilized in the pre-F form have been created for use as immunogens. DS-Cav1 [16], DS-Cav1-Cys-zipper [17], SC-TM [18] and SC-DM [18], all of which preserve antigenic site \u00d8, have been shown to elicit high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice, cotton rats, and macaques. However, antigenic site \u00d8 comprises less than 10% of the surface area of the RSV F trimer glycoprotein [9], providing ample opportunity for antigenic competition from irrelevant or less neutralization-sensitive epitopes on RSV F. A vaccine that were to more specifically present antigenic site \u00d8 might thus have the potential to focus and to improve the quality of the antibody response.",

            "text": "Immune-focusing of the vaccine response, through the removal of extraneous epitopes from vaccine immunogens, has been observed to elicit targeted antibody responses in several studies. With RSV, incorporation of two RSV F helices from antigenic site II into a protein scaffold resulted in immunogens that could elicit binding antibodies to site II in mice [19] and\u2014with the addition of an intervening loop\u2014neutralizing antibodies to site II in macaques [20], though the macaque titers appeared to be much lower than those elicited by trimeric immunogens, such as the RSV F trimer. With influenza A virus, headless or stalk-only immunogens of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein induced significantly higher titers of protective HA stem-directed antibodies than the seasonal influenza trivalent inactivated vaccine in mice [21, 22] and ferrets [22], and HA stem-directed antibodies that reduced symptoms of disease in macaques [21]. Furthermore, with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, mice immunized with the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-containing S1 subunit elicited more RBD-reactive neutralizing antibodies than mice immunized with DNA for full-length spike (S) protein [23]. We therefore hypothesized that a \u201chead-only\u201d immunogen might more ably boost antigenic site \u00d8-directed responses than the complete F glycoprotein. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of RSV F immunogens comprising only the membrane-distal half (head region) of the RSV F glycoprotein, with antigenic site \u00d8 intact and the membrane-proximal half (stalk region) completely removed. Four \u201chead-only\u201d RSV F immunogens were evaluated in prime-boost mouse immunogenicity studies, with two of these boosting RSV-neutralization titers to levels that were comparable to those boosted by the RSV F DS-Cav1 trimer, although increased site \u00d8-directed antibodies.",

All assays were performed with agitation set to 1,000 rpm in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in order to minimize nonspecific interactions. The final volume for all solutions was 50\u201380 \u03bcl/well. Assays were performed at 30\u00b0C in tilted black 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, NC). RSV F head-only variants (50 \u03bcg/ml) in PBS buffer was used to load anti-His-tag probes (HIS1K) for 300 s. Typical capture levels for each loading step were between 0.6 and 1.2 nm, and variability within a row of eight tips did not exceed 0.1 nm for each of these steps. The nm unit is a measure of the change in the interference pattern of white light reflected from the surface of the biosensor tip compared to an internal reference. This was measured in real-time and correlates with a change in the number of bound molecules on the biosensor tip surface. This can also be defined as a change in response units measured in nm [25, 26]. Biosensor tips were then equilibrated for 90 s in PBS + 1% BSA prior to measuring association with antigen binding fragments (Fabs) in solution (0.016 \u03bcM to 0.5 \u03bcM) for 300 s; Fabs were then allowed to dissociate for 300\u20131200 s. Parallel correction to subtract systematic baseline drift was carried out by subtracting the measurements recorded for a loaded sensor incubated in PBS + 1% BSA. Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out using Octet analysis software, version 8.0 (Pall ForteBio LLC, CA). Experimental data were fitted with a binding equation describing a 1:1 interaction. Global analyses of the complete data sets assuming reversible binding (full dissociation) were carried out using nonlinear least-squares fitting allowing a single set of binding parameters to be obtained simultaneously for all concentrations measured in a single experiment.",

Sera neutralization titers elicited from the immunization prime followed by the first boost were measured once for each mouse. Neutralization titers elicited from the second boost were measured four times and averaged for each mouse, except for sera elicited from the final i-447 boost and from the 3\u00d7DS-Cav1 immunization, which were measured three times for each mouse before averaging.",

We therefore designed 70 variants of head-only RSV F constructs using three different approaches (Fig 1C and S1 Table). For the first approach, domain III was expressed as a simple monomer (30 designs); in the second approach, domain III was expressed as a tandemly linked dimer (18 designs); in the third approach, a trimerization domain was fused to domain III to enable the expression of a trimeric protein resembling the native pre-fusion RSV F head (22 designs). The topology of RSV F is such that removal of the RSV F stalk from the RSV F head results in two separate F1 and F2 polypeptides within each head protomer. Reconnection of both polypeptides to make a single polypeptide afforded an opportunity to permute circularly the domain topology, by linking either F2 to F1, or F1 to F2 (S1 Fig). Most designs also incorporated the disulfide bond from DS-Cav1 (S155C-S290C) as well as the DS-Cav1 cavity filling mutations (S190F and V207L) [16] to stabilize the pre-fusion conformation. Numerous additional mutations included repacking of the protein interior, the addition of disulfide bonds, and the alteration of surface mutations to replace hydrophobic residues with hydrophilic residues or glycans. Moreover, various lengths of glycine rich linkers were used to link the two polypeptides of domain III and to connect them to trimerization domains. Finally, a signal peptide for secretion and a cleavable His-tag and Strep-tag to aid in purification were added to each construct.",

As several of the most potently neutralizing RSV F antibodies target antigenic site \u00d8, three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for this site were used as readout: antibodies D25, 5C4 and AM22. Additionally, because soluble RSV F trimers are metastable and spontaneously convert to a post-fusion conformation, D25 binding was also evaluated after one week at 4\u00b0C, and AM22 and 5C4 binding were evaluated after two and five weeks, respectively, at 4\u00b0C. Out of 70 designs, 51 (73%) had D25 ELISA readouts of 1.5 OD450 or higher after one week at 4\u00b0C (S2\u2013S4 Tables). To further gauge the stability of these immunogens, D25 recognition was also evaluated after one hour at 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100\u00b0C. Fifty of the head-only designs retained the majority of their D25 antigenicity after one hour at 70\u00b0C, conditions under which the parent DS-Cav1 RSV F trimer completely lost D25 recognition [16]. At 80\u00b0C and above, we observed a substantial decrease in D25 binding for most of the head-only immunogens (S2\u2013S4 Tables).",

Addition of Fab D25 resulted in trimeric star-like structures, consistent with a 1:3 binding stoichiometry and our proposed i-447 quaternary arrangement (Figs 3N and S4N). Deviations from perfect three-fold symmetry indicated some trimeric flexibility, though not to the extent observed for i-210.

These results suggested either this configuration to be not easily viewed in two dimensions or one protomer to have additional flexibility upon motavizumab Fab binding.

In each instance, the prime interval was three weeks and the boost interval was seven weeks. Such a boost may mimic the boosting of individuals who have been previously exposed to RSV. Notably, week 12 sera showed head-only boosting to elicit geometric mean titers for i-693 and i-447 of 14,844 and 12,998, respectively, which were statistically comparable with the mean titers for the RSV F DS-Cav1 control of 10,548 (Fig 4B).

Thus the dimeric i-693 and the trimeric i-447 did not appear to prime as well as the full length DS-Cav1, but they did appear to focus and to boost the head-directed neutralizing response.",

With the homologous DS-Cav1 prime/boost sera, no significant difference was observed in binding to the three probes (Fig 5A).

In contrast, the site \u00d8-KO probe bound significantly less to both i-447 and i-693 boosted sera (P = 0.0015 and 0.0021 respectively) than to the DS-Cav1 probe (Fig 5A).

DS-Cav1 added to sera from each of the three groups of immunized mice (3\u00d7DS-Cav1, 2\u00d7DS-Cav1 + 1\u00d7i-693 and 2\u00d7DS-Cav1 + 1\u00d7i-447) competed for sera very efficiently as expected, resulting in significantly reduced neutralization (P = <0.0001) (Fig 5B). However, the site \u00d8 KO and site II KO probes competed much less effectively than DS-Cav1, highlighting the importance of these sites (Fig 5B). In the DS-Cav1 and i-693-boosted group, antigenic site II KO probe competed more strongly than the antigenic site \u00d8 KO probe (P = 0.0354 and 0.0431 respectively), indicating antigenic site \u00d8 to be the dominant target of neutralization by these sera. In the i-447-boosted group, however, there was no significant difference in neutralization competition between antigenic site \u00d8 and site II KO probes. Thus, with regards to site-specific induced responses, our results indicate the RSV-neutralizing response boosted by head-only immunogens i-693 and i-447 to indeed be more focused on head-specific sites \u00d8 and II, especially antigenic site \u00d8.",

            "text": "A major goal for RSV-vaccine development is to identify immunogens that can boost antibody responses to neutralization-sensitive epitopes in the setting of pre-existing immunity. Increasing serum-neutralizing activity in pregnant women would help to increase their protective response and to extend the period of maternally-acquired protection from RSV. Likewise, in elderly people who have experienced repeated RSV infections throughout life, but still have modest levels of serum-neutralizing activity, boosting the response to neutralization-sensitive epitopes could achieve greater than threshold levels of protective immunity. Therefore, we took a structure-based design approach to produce immunogens that focused immune recognition on the apical surfaces of the pre-F trimer. We removed the stalk portion from the RSV F trimeric glycoprotein to create 70 RSV F head-only immunogens. Fifty of these designs were recognized by antibodies to the metastable antigenic site \u00d8 (D25, AM22 and 5C4) and were stable for at least one hour at 70\u00b0C, a temperature at which DS-Cav1 rapidly inactivates (Table 1). The thermostable head-only immunogens included 26 monomers, 6 dimers, and 18 trimers. Four of these, a monomer (i-273), a dimer (i-693) and two trimers (i-210 and i-447), were expressed, purified, and characterized for antigenicity, overall stability, structural integrity, and immunogenicity. Although all four of these head-only immunogens displayed nanomolar affinity to antigenic site \u00d8-directed antibodies and had physical stability that was similar or exceeded that of DS-Cav1, only one of the immunogens (the i-447 trimer) was able to elicit RSV-neutralizing titers in mice that were comparable to those elicited by DS-Cav1 (Fig 4A). The lower overall immunogenicity of these head-only immunogens may relate to increased flexibility between protomers, as we recently found that the reduction of interprotomer flexibility in pre-F trimers yielded higher immunogenicity [42].",

This suggests that antigenic site II may potentially play a role in the overall effectiveness of the head-only immunogens, which is consistent with the neutralization competition data (Fig 5B). The small size and extensive surface mutagenesis of the i-273 monomer, and the greater structural heterogeneity and surface mutations of the i-210 trimer relative to i-447 may also have diminished the capabilities of these head-only immunogens.",

Indeed, full length RSV F protein has been successfully expressed in apples [51], tomatoes [52], and insect cells [53]. Furthermore, the successful use of live chimeric vectors such as Sendai [54] or human parainfluenza virus type 3 [55] or replication-defective vectors such as adenovirus [56, 57] or Modified Vaccinia Ankara [57] to express RSV F protein and elicit immune responses in vector-immunized animals suggests alternative delivery methods could also be applied to head-only RSV F immunogens in a vaccination setting.",

            "text": "The design of even smaller RSV F head-derived immunogens with less extraneous non-neutralizing epitopes could potentially focus the RSV F immune response still further. However, such immunogen designs could be complicated if both non-proximal antigenic sites \u00d8 and II were retained or if increased T cell help from the addition of universal T cell epitope peptides [58, 59] is required for the smallest immunogens. Although we did not observe a consistent correlation between oligomer size (i.e. monomer, dimer and trimer) and neutralization titers or immune focusing, increasing the immunogen oligomerization state in an ordered manner might also be expected to improve immune focusing since it would provide more opportunities for irrelevant epitopes to be masked by neighbor-neighbor interactions and the additional multivalency of the target epitope could lead to increased B cell avidity through antibody cross-linking, resulting in increased immunogenicity for the epitope [41, 60]. Therefore, additional multimerization by incorporation into nanoparticles [53, 61] might further improve both immune focusing and overall immunogenicity of the head-only RSV F immunogens.",
