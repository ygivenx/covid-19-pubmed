            "text": "Nucleotide skew analysis [1] provides a powerful tool to visualize compositional aspects of a DNA/RNA sequence. For instance, the minimum and maximum of a G vs C skew can be used to predict the origin of replication and the location of the terminus, respectively, in prokaryotic genomes [2\u20134]. The GenSkew algorithm [1] calculates ratio values of the six nucleotide combinations (C vs G, G vs A, U vs G, U vs A, C vs A, and U vs C) in predefined windows and steps along a sequence. Ratio values are calculated according to (N1-N2)/(N1+N2), and hence, a positive value indicates that N1 wins over N2. Skew graphs are generally created by plotting the subsequent windows as numbers on the X-axis against the corresponding cumulative skew values on the Y-axis. In this way, we demonstrated for a representative collection of RNA viruses that the skew plots can be interpreted as \u201cnucleotide compositional signatures\u201d of the viral genomes and that these characteristic signatures are more prominently observed in the single-stranded regions than that in the base-paired, double-stranded regions of a viral RNA genome [5]. Likewise, we demonstrated that purine enrichment in the Zika virus RNA genome [6] is a general property of most but not all Flaviviridae and, surprisingly, prominently observed at the first position of the codons and not the silent 3rd codon position (unpublished results). It is, however, difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative to compare different skew graphs with respect to similarities and dissimilarities. We therefore developed a simple mathematical addition to GenSkew analysis that converts skew data into a pairwise Euclidean distance matrix, which can be formatted by means of clustering into a neighbour-joining tree, facilitating the identification of putative relationships, e.g., between viral sequences. The key result of this study is that this Euclidean algorithm offers an easy and quantitative interpretation of nucleotide skew data of virus genomes. The construction of Euclidean distance trees based on skewed nucleotide compositions does not require a prior alignment of the sequences. In contrast, \u201cclassical\u201d phylogenetic trees are modelled after accurate nucleotide alignment of the sequences. As an additional result, we demonstrate that skew distance trees and phylogenetic trees are surprisingly similar but not identical.",

Flaviviridae were selected and classified according to [9, 10] (Berkhout and van Hemert, unpublished results). GenBank IDs are provided in the figures. Nucleotide skew analysis was done by means of the GenSkew algorithm [1], of which Dr. T. Rattei (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen) kindly provided a version that is not restricted by the length of a sequence. For normalization purposes, the overlapping window size was set 1% of the sequence length with a step size of 20% of the window size. The skew between two nucleotides N1 and N2 is defined by the ratio (N1 \u2212 N2)/(N1 + N2), and hence, a positive value of this ratio indicates that N1 proportionally exceeds N2. If the N1 versus N2 comparison results in a negative skew value, the same but positive skew value is true for these nucleotides in the reverse order (N2 versus N1). Algorithms converting skew data into a pairwise Euclidean distance matrix are provided as Additional File S1. The multiple sequence alignment of coronaviral, flaviviral, picornaviral, and HIV genomes was obtained by means of MAFFT [11]. Other alignments and Neighbor Joining (NJ) skew distance trees were built in MEGA v7 [12]. Phylogenetic histories were inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution in the viral genomes [12]. A discrete gamma distribution (5 categories) was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. Randomization of the rubella virus RNA genome (10 consecutive cycles to ensure complete nucleotide randomization) was performed by means of the BioWeb server (http://www.cellbiol.com/scripts/randomizer/dna_protein_sequence_randomizer.php). All calculations were performed in Excel.",

            "text": "We used the rubella virus with its G- and C-rich RNA genome (JN635295) to illustrate the skew plot analysis (Figure 1). Skew profiles are shown of the nucleotide sequence before Figure 1(a) and after 10 consecutive cycles of randomization Figure 1(b). The profiles are nearly identical because skew profiles are determined solely by nucleotide composition and not by the nucleotide sequence. The rubella virus RNA genome size is 9761 nucleotides, and hence, the window size and step size are set to 98 (1% of sequence length) and 20 (20% of window size), respectively, generating 489 overlapping windows from the 5\u2032- to the 3\u2032-end (X-axis) with the corresponding skew values cumulatively plotted on the Y-axis. The skew lines start by definition at the origin of the plot. It should be noted that, in skew language, CG does not represent a CG base pair but a comparison of the C with the G nucleotide proportions. We adopted the notation C versus G (C vs G) in the text and the figures. The nucleotides C and G win over A (steep positive slope), and the U-nucleotide loses from C and G (steep negative slope) by approximately the same proportion. C is slightly more prominent than G, and the proportions of U and A are close to equality. Importantly, the skew profiles are straight lines, which indicates that the virus-specific nucleotide bias is quite constant along the sequence of the RNA genome. Therefore, skew values at the ultimate 3\u2032 end of the genome (position 489) represent a reliable measure of the pairwise nucleotide compositional bias of the rubella virus genome. For instance, the skew endpoint values of C vs A (216.24) and U vs C (\u2212213.37) are very similar but with the opposite sign. The same is true for G vs A (169.79) and U vs G (\u2212168.02), and the skew endpoint values for C vs G and U vs A are 56.39 and 2.31, respectively. For the rubella virus genome, these values can be considered a characteristic signature of the nucleotide composition and presented as a vector in a six-dimensional Euclidean space (C vs G, G vs A, U vs G, U vs A, C vs A, U vs C) = (56.39, 169.79, \u2212168.02, 2.31, 216.24, \u2212213.37).",

The resulting vectors can be formatted into a pairwise Euclidean distance matrix and visualized by means of cluster analysis as a neighbor-joining tree. It should be emphasized that the branch nodes of the skew value trees predict equality of the nucleotide skew values among the viral species involved. In contrast, branch nodes of evolutionary trees derived by means of nucleotide substitution models mark the expectation of sequence equality\u2014the common ancestor\u2014of the taxa involved. Hence, only partial similarity between the two tree building methods can be expected. Here, we apply the procedure to collections of arbitrarily chosen genomes of picornaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and HIV-1 subtypes. First, we investigated whether the Euclidean skew algorithm is able to discern differences among the four families of viral genomes. Next, the four viral families are individually subjected to the Euclidean skew analysis.",

The picornaviruses (green) are significantly less resolved. Notably, HIV-1 genomes share A enrichment as the common feature of their nucleotide composition [13], coronavirus genomes typically tend to accumulate the U-nucleotide [14], and the Flaviviridae displays enhanced purine proportions in the first codon positions (unpublished results). The genomes of picornavirus species do not display such a prominent compositional feature. Apparently, the skew algorithm is able to discern viral families by giving credit to unique compositional features that are typical of a virus family. Viral genomes with a nucleotide composition that is more relaxed like picornavirus RNA are resolved poorly by the skew algorithm. A \u201cclassically\u201d constructed phylogeny of the viruses shows a similar grouping (Figure 2(b)). HIV (red), coronavirus (black), and flavivirus species (blue) are clustered in separated clades, whereas representatives of picornavirus are found scattered among the flavi- and coronaviruses. With respect to salivirus, aichivirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and hepatitis A virus, both trees show similar topological positions, but in general, this is not the case. In addition, construction of \u201cclassical\u201d phylogenetic trees relies a great deal on the accurate alignment of the sequences involved, which becomes less reliable as the evolutionary distance of the taxa increases.

The lower group with the human 229E, NL63, and OC43 coronaviruses displays U vs C skew values increasing from 140 to 201. Apparently, the opposite movement of the U and C proportions in coronaviral genomes is a distinctive feature, and hence, an important parameter in shaping coronaviral phylogenies is based on nucleotide substitution (Figure 3(b)). We included two unclassified virus isolates\u2014marked in italic\u2014to investigate whether the method can contribute to an initial virus classification. The unclassified Bat-Rousettus isolate is found near the Vespertilio coronavirus, and the unclassified Bat-BM48-31 isolate is at the root position of in the upper clade.",

The algorithm distinguishes related and unrelated sequences, particularly in case of compositional features that are characteristic for a certain virus family (e.g., A-accumulation in HIV, the U-C balance in coronavirus genomes, and the purine enrichment at the first codon position in flaviviral genomes). Within a family of viral genomes, the topology based on Euclidean skew distances is surprisingly similar (but not identical) to the topology based on regular evolutionary analysis (coronavirus, flavivirus, and picornavirus). This is remarkable because branch nodes in skew-based trees predict equal skew values of both sequences, and, in contrast, branch nodes in evolutionary trees mark nucleotide sequence equality of the two taxa. The resolving power of skew value analysis is diminished at high sequence similarity as shown for HIV-1 subtypes. This is due to the prominent A-pressure in all HIV genomes [15].",

In addition, we demonstrated similarity of skew data-based cluster trees with \u201cclassical\u201d maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed via a general time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution during evolution. Confidence of ancestral nodes in \u201cclassical\u201d trees is usually attained by means of bootstrap analysis, which requires repetitive resampling of sites in the original sequence alignment. Each bootstrap replicate generates a tree, and a consensus tree is constructed based on the collection of replicates. Each node in this consensus tree is decorated with the frequency number (%) that reflects the level of bootstrap support. It is evident that a skew-based pairwise distance matrix cannot be used for bootstrap analysis simply due to the absence of a sequence alignment. Also, resampling of sites in a sequence prior to skew analysis does not affect the skew data vector (Figure 1). Future investigation may reveal whether the building of skew-based trees may serve as a valuable addition to many sequence-independent methods of evolutionary tree reconstruction.",
