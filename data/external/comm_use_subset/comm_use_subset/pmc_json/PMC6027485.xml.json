Viruses are the leading causes of acute respiratory disease throughout the world. The most common viral etiologic agents of ARIs are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIV 1-2-3) and adenoviruses (AdV), human rhinoviruses (RV), human coronaviruses (CoV), enteroviruses (EnV), and human bocavirus (BoV) [7,8,9]. In addition, human polyomaviruses (KI, WU) have been detected in patients with respiratory infections [7,10]. Although ARIs have traditionally been thought to be caused by single viruses, an increasing number of reports have reported respiratory diseases occurring as dual or multiple virus infections [11,12,13,14,15,16]. There are suggestions that respiratory viral co-infections affect disease severity with some studies suggesting that dual and multiple infections increase the severity of respiratory disease [12,14,16], while dual or multiple infections may actually be protective [13].",

Medications cover almost all possible responses to the infectious process and often do not show the desired results [19,22], and the idea of fast elimination of a viral agent from the cells of infected body is still a topical issue [23]. The emergence of drug-resistant influenza variants has led to a decline in the efficacy such drugs as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), amantadine (Symmetrel), and rimantadine (Flumadine) [24,25,26]. Therefore, new therapeutics against respiratory viral infections with novel mechanisms of action and against new targets are urgently required.

Data presented in Table 2 shows that fever and intoxication duration was considerably shorter in ORNs-D-M-treated patients than in the same group of patients with ARI uncomplicated or complicated with pneumonia (p < 0.05). Duration of cough in the main group was only 5.1 \u00b1 0.4 days and 7.5 \u00b1 0.8 days in the control group (p < 0.05). In patients who did not receive ORNs-D-M all clinical signs lasted longer and they stayed longer at hospital. The virus elimination depending on different treatment methods was studied. The etiology of 40 people of the main group was deciphered during the admission according to PCR (43 positive results). In early convalescence, pathogens were found again only in 3 (7.5%) of these patients of the main group and in 22 (57.9%) of 38 patients of the control group (p < 0.001).",

Viral pathogens are the most common etiological agents of ARIs [13,15,37]. In the presented study, ORNs-D-M were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the PIV3, pandemic influenza CA709, and influenza virus PR834 in vitro. The study of ORNs-D-M antiviral effect against the PIV3 in vitro proved that the both forms of the drug can inhibit this virus infectivity. The injection form of ORNs-D-M had stronger anti-PIV3 effect than the capsule form. The degree of antiviral effect of both forms depends on the concentration of the drug. Analyses of available avian influenza viruses circulating worldwide suggest that most viruses are susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir [38]. However, some evidence of antiviral resistance has been reported in HPAI Asian lineage AIV (cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/prevention.htm). Therefore, it is important to search for the influenza antiviral drugs with a wide spectrum of antiviral action. The results of this research (Figure 2) proved that ORNs-D-M at concentration of 5.0 mg/mL have activity against the AIV, selectivity index >3. The obtained results suggest that ORNs-D-M can probably be used as an antiviral drug against an AIV. Whilst we found that ORNs-D-M have antiviral activity against the pandemic virus CA709, Figure 2.",

Previously, we proved that ORNs-D-M has specific antiviral effect due to its ability to inhibit the NA action of the influenza virus (FM147) in vitro [30]. After comparison of the results of previous research on NA action of the influenza virus (FM147) [30], we proved the effective inhibition of the receptor in both studies. The inhibition 40.5% of NA activity strain A/PR8/34 (H1N1) by injection form of ORNs-D-M takes place in concentration (Figure 3) that is 50 times less than in the research on the influenza virus (FM147). These results suggest greater efficiency of the injection form, as well as different sensitivities of different strains of NA to the inhibiting effect of ORNs-D-M. Our results also suggest antiviral activity in ORNs-D-M against the influenza CA709, PR834, AIV, and PIV3 in vitro. These antiviral activities of ORNs-D-M can be attributed to inhibiting the NA activity and HA\u2013glycan interaction of influenza viruses [30,31] and inhibiting the Toll-like receptors 3, 7, and 8, impairing the upregulation of genes induced by viruses [40].",
