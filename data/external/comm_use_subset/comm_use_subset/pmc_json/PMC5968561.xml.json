            "text": "One of the hallmarks of class I viral fusion proteins on the periphery of enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus is the triggered formation of an \u03b1-helical trimer-of-hairpins motif that is a critical prelude to the fusion between the virus and the target cell membrane.1 The trimer-of-hairpins of HIV-1 is arguably the most typical example of such a coiled-coil six-helical bundle (6-HB), where the N-terminal heptad repeats (NHRs) of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) gp41 subunit form the central trimeric coiled-coil inner core, and three C-terminal heptad repeats (CHRs) pack obliquely in an antiparallel manner (Fig. 1A).2 Previous studies have indicated that an extended pre-hairpin intermediate exists, in which the trimeric NHR coiled-coil or the CHR motif is exposed.3 Inhibition of the transitions and folding of the pre-hairpin intermediates into their fusogenic 6-HBs has significant biomedical potential in interrupting the process of membrane fusion and stopping viral infection.4 The first proof of concept came from the study of a peptide corresponding to the HIV-1 gp41 CHR region, i.e., T20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon), which was approved by the U.S. FDA as the first HIV-1 fusion inhibitor.5 The paradigm established by T20 for HIV-1 has launched the identification of a new line of analogous CHR peptide-based fusion inhibitors for other class I viral fusion proteins, with promising antiviral activity.6\u20139 In sharp contrast, peptides derived from the NHR region of the fusion proteins are generally much less potent inhibitors than CHR peptides, and their development as antiviral agents has been hampered because linear NHR peptides on their own aggregate under physiological conditions and cannot automatically form their naturally occurring trimeric coiled-coil structure, a prerequisite for interaction with the complementary CHR region.9\u201311 Therefore, efforts have been directed toward the preparation of stable and soluble N-trimer mimetics. These have included the construction of several chimeric molecules by introducing an exogenous trimerization motif to a portion of the N-helix and further stabilization of these trimeric oligomers through disulfide bonds.12\u201316 However, these modifications suffer from extra-large auxiliary protein domains, which may attenuate the antiviral activity of the NHR-trimer mimetics,10 and if used as antigens, the nonrelevant portion of the peptide chimera might induce undesired immune recognition.17 Moreover, the exogenous motifs might divert the real conformation of the NHR trimer in the prefusogenic state, thus thwarting their application as drug targets to screen small molecules18 or identify therapeutics via mirror image phage display.19",

This approach takes advantage of several rules-of-thumb for coiled-coil trimers and translates the isopeptide bridge-tethering structure from a designed simple sequence to the more challenging native protein coiled coil. We chose NHR peptide-based HIV-1 fusion inhibitors as templates for our study, based on their low capacity to sequester into a non-aggregating helical trimer conformation, which is a true reflection of the practical challenges for broader recapitulation of NHR trimers of class I fusion proteins.",

In the design of N36M, the 7th residue Gln and the 10th residue Leu of N36, located at positions a and d, respectively, were replaced with Ile residues. Then, the 6th residue Gln at the g position and the 11th residue Leu at the e position of N36 were further substituted by positively and negatively charged residues, respectively, to form favorable interhelical i to i\u2032 + 5 electrostatic interactions. Based on the structure of N36M, N36MEK1 and N36MEK2 were designed so that Glu\u2013Lys intra-strand salt bridges were introduced at i to i + 3 or both i to i + 3 and i to i + 4 positions of the helical conformation, respectively, to enhance stability of the coiled-coil assemblies.",

Strikingly, with the optimization of only four residues, N36M mostly displayed a trimeric form, as shown by a single peak using SVA at 1.61 s, with an obtained molecular mass of 13.4 kDa (Table S1 and Fig. S1, ESI\u2020). Next, we examined the nature and stability of the secondary structure in the trimeric NHR oligomers using CD spectroscopy. The relative helicity of peptides is typically extrapolated by the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. The N36 peptide formed partial helical structures with 27% helicity. Notably, the CD spectra of these trimeric assemblies were consistent with a dramatically improved \u03b1-helical content, ranging from 62% to 67%. The thermal unfolding transition (Tm) for N36M, N36MEK1, and N36MEK2 was determined to be 57 \u00b0C, 61 \u00b0C, and 67 \u00b0C, respectively, suggesting that stabilization of individual helices contributes significantly to the helical trimer stability (Table S1, ESI\u2020). In addition, their Tm values were dependent on peptide concentration, further demonstrating that they were self-associating species (Fig. S2, ESI\u2020). Together, these CD and SVA data are consistent with N36M, N36MEK1, and N36MEK2 folding to form thermally stable trimeric coiled-coils as designed.",

As evidenced by RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE, neither N36M(SBn)EK1 nor N36M(SBn) disappeared after incubation for 12 h, consistent with our previous data, indicating a positive correlation between oligomer stability and acyl transfer rates. To test the specificity of the acyl transfer reaction in N36M(SBn)EK2 and N36M(SBn)EK1, control peptides were generated in which the reactive Lys and its upstream Lys residues were mutated to Arg (Table S2, ESI\u2020).

We and others have previously shown that most of the T20-resistant HIV-1 variants contain mutations in the \u201cGIV\u201d motif (amino acids GIVQQQNNLL) located in the gp41 NHR region, which is the main target site of T20 and some other C-peptides.24 N-trimer-based HIV-1 fusion inhibitors inhibit HIV-1 entry by targeting the gp41 CHR region. The mutations in the viral gp41 NHR region are not expected to affect the binding of the N-trimer-based fusion inhibitors with the viral gp41 CHR region. Therefore, these well-folded N-trimer-based fusion inhibitors have the advantage over the C-peptide fusion inhibitors because they do not target the \u201cGIV\u201d motif-containing NHR region, thus avoiding cross-drug resistance with T20 and other CHR-based anti-HIV-1 agents. In addition, (N36M)3 exhibited dramatically increased in vitro metabolic stability over T20 in proteinase K (a broad-spectrum serine proteinase) solution, liver and kidney homogenates, as well as in rat plasma, suggesting that it is a good potential drug candidate for further development (Fig. 4).",

Harnessing bioactive peptides, e.g., T20, to target the coiled coil domain assembly in viral fusion for developing highly selective and potent antiviral agents with minimal systemic toxicity has been successful in clinical application. Unfortunately, T20 has only been relegated to a salvage treatment option, mostly due to accelerated emergence of T20-resistant HIV-1 variants, rapid proteolysis, and high cost of manufacture. The proteolytic shortcoming renders a dosage of 90 mg of T20 subcutaneously twice daily, resulting in increased cost of treatment and poor patient compliance. In our present work, isopeptide bridge-tethered NHR trimeric coiled-coils are totally different species compared with T20 in structure and binding target, thus effectively overcoming HIV drug resistance to T20. Although the cost of producing isopeptide bond-tethered N-trimers would be slightly higher than T20, their much higher resistance to proteolytic degradation should help to prolong the existence of the drug molecules in the circulatory system, which would dramatically decrease the cost of the treatment and improve treatment compliance and patients\u2019 quality of life. It is worth noting that the inhibition of protein\u2013protein interactions has been widely regarded as a challenging task due to their extensive flat and large interfacial areas, as well as noncontiguous binding regions.26 Compared with chimeric N-peptides, our recapitulated gp41 NHR helical trimers in the absence of auxiliary protein domains enable more interactions with the target that generate more effective antiviral activity. In addition, the isopeptide bond-tethered N-trimer mimetics may outperform disulfide-bonded chimeric N-peptides in terms of proteolytic stability because disulfides have a possibility to be cleaved via the extracellular thiol-containing molecules and oxido-reductases.27 Taken together, our constructed gp41 NHR-trimer mimetics have good potential in developing effective, safe, and long-lasting HIV-1 fusion inhibitors.",

Our study reveals that these NHR trimeric coiled coils homologous with naturally occurring protein sequences have extraordinary thermostability, which contributes positively to their promising inhibition of HIV-1 fusion against a broad spectrum of laboratory-adapted and primary isolates, including those resistant to clinically used T20. In addition, their tertiary structural integrity makes them less sensitive to proteolysis compared to the unstructured peptide T20. Given the common features underlying the class I fusion proteins, our coiled-coil recapitulation methodology shows a high potential for producing NHR-trimer mimetics for other class I enveloped viruses.
