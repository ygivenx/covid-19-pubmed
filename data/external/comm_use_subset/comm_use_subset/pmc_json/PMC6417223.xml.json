The WHO estimated that the worldwide health care workforce had a shortfall of seven million professionals in 2013, and predicted it would reach 18 million by 2030 [1]. Furthermore, the WHO views the unequal distribution of the health care workforce to be a major public health problem. The shortage of health care workers and their unequal geographical distribution are prominently evident in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The extremely rapid economic growth of the Gulf countries during the twentieth century, following the discovery of new energy sources, created opportunities but also presented challenges in managing health care systems [3, 4].",

The epidemic of chronic diseases in the GCC countries will require innovative approaches to management and treatment. Along with health care reform, there is therefore a need for a broad curricular reform to upgrade the existing health education programs within the GCC countries. Challenges associated with reforming education programs include a) the rapidly expanding base of medical knowledge, b) the conflict between \u2018top down\u2019 lecture systems and more flexible and innovative \u2018flipped\u2019 classroom teaching, and c) the growing disconnect between the traditional curricula with reductive biological basis and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, which have strong social determinants. Even when such challenges are identified, the cost, time, and effort required to upgrade the educational systems can present significant hurdles.",

As an example, for physicians, high quality training programs are of limited value if postgraduate training programs for students and continuing professional development (CPD) programs for professionals are not aligned, invested in, or simply do not exist. In the GCC countries, all health care professionals are required to pursue CPD or continuing medical education (CME) for re-licensure. The challenge is to develop appropriate programs that address the needs of the GCC countries with their unique demographics. For GCC countries to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 [10], it is essential to evaluate health care capacity in two critical areas: 1) adequacy of the health care workforce, and 2) profession and specialty specific undergraduate, postgraduate, and CME/CPD education programs.",

Broadly, capacity building efforts include three essential components: 1) acquiring requisite skills, 2) improving these skills over time, and 3) retaining updated skills [11\u201313]. These efforts should also focus on organizational development, resource allocation, building partnerships within and outside GCC countries, and developing leadership pathways [13, 14]. In this report we discuss the challenges and potential strategies for improving and strengthening capacity building efforts in health care professions in the GCC. Our discussion is presented in three parts: 1) planning and assessment, 2) infrastructure for health profession schools, and 3) health care workforce capacity building. In the section on health care work capacity building we discuss, debate, and make general recommendations concerning a) the adequacy of the health care workforce, b) CME and CPD, c) the role of regulatory authorities in training health care professionals, d) prominent examples of education-based capacity building efforts in the region, and e) present additional evidence suggesting that health care capacity in the GCC can be strengthened by developing links to non-GCC organizations.",

The WHO recognized four dimensions that define health care workforce performance: availability, competence, responsiveness, and productivity [2]. The findings of the meeting elaborated further that health care workforce competence, which encompasses the combination of technical knowledge, skills, and behaviors, could be positively influenced by supportive supervision coupled with audit, feedback, and lifelong learning [2]. Although, an adequately and appropriately trained health care workforce is essential, there is currently a lack of sufficient training capacity [17].",

This program also focuses on improving infrastructure, however less focus has been placed on health care professional education [19]. Gaps between training, knowledge, and skills of physicians and nurses, and the identified needs to address adolescent health issues, have been reported for Saudi Arabia [22]. These gaps must be addressed. Furthermore, the readiness of Saudi Arabia for health care organizational change has been questioned [19].",

Along those lines, establishing models of team-based training and diversifying health care curricula and CME/CPD programs are vital for capacity building endeavors. These steps will decrease the reliance on an expatriate health care workforce and improve the quality of health care in the region. Similarly, building capacity at undergraduate and postgraduate training levels are also steps in the right direction. CME/CPD programs are a vital component for capacity building in health care professions as they transform the existing health care systems by training the workforce to address identified population health needs.",
