In contrast to supernatant-based assays (such as ELISA or cytokine bead arrays/Luminex), the analyte is directly captured around the secreting T cell, before it evades detection by binding to receptors of adjacent cells, dilution in the supernatant, or degradation by proteases. With a general limit of detection at 1 in 100,000 PBMC (0.001%) ELISPOT is orders of magnitudes more sensitive than supernatant-based measurements [11]. Using a similar approach, antigen-specific T cells can also be detected by flow cytometry through intracytoplasmic cytokine staining (ICS). Typical ICS is less sensitive for detecting rare cells, however, due to its detection limit of 0.02% [14]. Furthermore, ELISPOT assays detect the actually secreted analyte in pharmacologically untreated cells while ICS does not account for post transcriptional regulation and requires treatment of the cells with Golgi inhibitors to prevent secretion.

When it comes to the detection of polyfunctional T cells, dual color ELISPOT assays permit the measurement of cytokine coexpression in individual T cells with the same sensitivity as ICS, however, low frequency responses that are difficult to detect by ICS can be readily detected by dual color ELISPOT [22]. After years of more or less successful experimentation with homemade dual color ELISPOT assays, kits recently have become readily available. These advancements have largely increased the versatility of the ELISPOT assay allowing monitoring of all major T cell effector lineages. Requiring only 100,000 PBMC per data point, ELISPOT needs less PBMC than flow cytometry-based assays which is important in the context of clinical trials where the number of PBMC that can be obtained is a critical limiting factor. This, coupled with the ease of validating and implementing ELISPOT [23], has made it one of the primary assays of choice for immune monitoring. ",

            "text": "The fact that antigen-specific T cells with a given specificity frequently occur at very low frequencies in PBMC continues to be a major challenge for immune monitoring. This is particularly true for chronic infections, long term immune memory, auto- and tumor-reactive T cells, and immune responses induced by subunit vaccinations. In these settings, the antigen-specific T cells can occur at or below the detection limit of even ELISPOT assays (0.001%). Therefore, one of the major goals of immune monitoring is to lower the detection limit of ELISPOT assays for antigen-specific T cells. Towards this goal, it has been reported that \u201covernight resting\u201d of cryopreserved PBMC after thawing before their utilization in ELISPOT assays would increase the sensitivity of the assay, that is, provide higher antigen-induced spot counts [24,25]. Because of the promise it holds, the resting strategy has been readily embraced and recommended by some immune monitoring panels [26]. Resting, however, comes at the cost of substantial additional work, longer assay duration, and loss of PBMC that are limiting in most clinical trials. It is assumed that during the resting period apoptotic PBMC contained within the thawed PBMC die leaving a higher frequency of viable, functional cells for the assay [27]. While this rationale holds for clinical PBMC samples in which the frequency of apoptotic cells is high, does it also hold for PBMC that have been frozen according to optimized protocols when the numbers of apoptotic cells are negligible? Currently no systematic study exists that compares the benefits vs. downsides of overnight resting. The study reported here was designed to fill this gap. ",

            "text": "Immune monitoring, in general, and ELISPOT in particular, aims at establishing accurately the frequencies of antigen-specific T cells in vivo. Ideally, T cell assays are performed with freshly isolated PBMC as soon as possible after the blood draw. During the 24 h duration of the ELISPOT assays antigen stimulation does not result in significant in vitro expansion of the antigen-specific T cells. Therefore, the frequencies measured in freshly isolated cells match the sought after in vivo frequency. Test results obtained with freshly isolated PBMC, therefore, can be considered as the baseline against which variations of PBMC handling, such as cryopreservation or resting, can be compared. When PBMC are cryopreserved and thawed according to protocols that we have established, the frequencies measured in freshly isolated PBMC \u201cex vivo\u201d, and in the thawed PBMC were shown to be identical for CD4 and CD8 cells [15] which established that PBMC can be cryopreserved without loss of T cell functionality. Notably, this equal performance of non-cryopreserved \u201cex vivo\u201d and of cryopreserved PBMC was seen without resting when the cells were plated into the assay right after thawing. In the present study, we selected CEF peptides to stimulate CD8 cells [28,29], and mumps antigen to stimulate CD4 cells. The CEF pool consists of 32 immunodominant peptides of cytomegalo-, Epstein Barr- and flu virus. Figure 1A,B shows cell separation experiments that confirm that CEF peptides activate CD8, and mumps antigen activates CD4 cells, respectively. Figure 1C,D also shows that for CEF- and mumps-antigen-elicited CD4 and CD8 cell recall responses similar IFN-\u03b3 spot counts were obtained when non-cryopreserved PBMC were tested ex vivo within 2 h after the blood draw, or after freeze-thawing, without resting. In this paper we refer to non-rested freeze-thawed cells as \u201cfresh\u201d to distinguish them from \u201crested\u201d and \u201cex vivo\u201d PBMC. In extensive subsequent studies we have confirmed for a multitude of other antigens that recall CD4 and CD8 memory cells in non-cryopreserved (\u201cex vivo\u201d) PBMC and freeze-thawed PBMC without resting (\u201cfresh\u201d) provide comparable results, and we have shown that in the thawed PBMC the numbers of apoptotic cells were less than 5% when measured within 30 minutes after thawing [30]. A basic assumption of this paper therefore is that freshly thawed non-rested (\u201cfresh\u201d) PBMC show equal performance to non-cryopreserved ex vivo PBMC and can be used to test the impact of resting in ELISPOT. The basic question that we address here therefore is, does \u201covernight resting\u201d reliably improve ELISPOT assay performance relative to test results obtained on freshly thawed PBMC? ",

These PBMC were obtained from healthy donors by leucapheresis, and cells of each donor had been frozen in hundreds of identical aliquots allowing replication of experiments using the very same cell material. Hundreds of HLA-typed and immune characterized donors constitute the library. The PBMC were tested \u201cfresh\u201d for reactivity to CEF peptide pool, and to mumps antigen. For both antigens, the response levels ranged from undetectable (defined as the difference between spot counts in triplicate medium control wells vs. triplicate antigen-stimulated wells not being significantly different based on t-test evaluation) to high, reaching up to 400 antigen-elicited spots forming units (SFU) per one million PBMC over a background that was typically zero, and in no sample exceeded 10 spots per million. Because the background was negligibly low for all PBMC samples when tested \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201crested\u201d, in the graphical representation of the data for this paper we will omit the background spots. Such a wide range of recall response levels to individual antigens within different human donors is typically seen for non-cryopreserved PBMC ex vivo [14,15,18,20], even when donors are vaccinated at the same time and are tested at a given time point after vaccination [18]. It is even characteristic for recall responses of inbred mice when all parameters of the immunization, the genetic background and environmental influences are kept constant [4,7,9,17]. For individual donors, the response levels for CEF and mumps were not linked: donors that displayed a high response level to CEF could be low or non-responders to mumps, and vice versa (examples are shown in Figure 4). In addition, donors that were low or non-responders to both antigens, responded vigorously to some others of the over 30 antigens for which all PBMC were tested (see ePBMC data base [31]\u2014the ePBMC library consists of a large selection of precharacterized PBMC samples with established HLA types and antigen reactivities). Therefore, when low response levels were detected to either CEF peptides or mumps antigen this reflects low frequency of CEF or mumps antigen-reactive T cells in the respective PBMC donor, and not a general lack of functionality in that particular PBMC sample caused by suboptimal freezing, storage, or thawing of the cells.

For five of the 11 donors the spot counts were decreased or equal.

In Figure 4 the results are shown for four donors that are representative of all 25 donors. First, it can be seen that a sample that is a low responder to CEF can be a high responder to mumps, and vice versa (donor 1 vs. donors 3 and 4). Donor 2, while being a low responder to both CEF and mumps is a high responder to candida and PPD (purified protein derivate) tuberculin (data not shown). Second, if a donor tested \u201cfresh\u201d as high or low responder to CEF or mumps in the first experiment, the same response level reproduced in the repeat experiment for both antigens. The inter-assay variation for the freshly thawed samples was not significant. Third, if after resting there was no significant gain seen for the CEF response in the first experiment, it was also not evident in the repeat experiment (donors 1 and 2), but if resting resulted in a moderate gain in the CEF response in the first experiment, a gain of similar magnitude was also seen in the repeat experiment (donors 2 and 3). Similarly, the decreased mumps response seen after resting for donors 1 and 3 reproduced in the repeat experiment, as did the unchanged mumps response levels for donors 2 and 4. Fourth, Figure 4 illustrates that the increase for one antigen after resting can result in unchanged or decreased response levels to another antigen. Fifth, this figure illustrates that in the low responder category resting does not predictably increase reactivity levels. Since increases and decreases of the antigen reactivity after resting were reproducible in the repeat experiment, they appear to be an inherent propensity of the respective PBMC.",

Resting PBMC in medium for 20 h represents such a stimulation-free culture period for the different cell lineages contained within PBMC. It is also conceivable that some cells/cell-lineages that appear viable directly after thawing have been injured during the freeze-thaw process and undergo apoptosis during the resting period. To establish how many cells are lost during resting, we compared viable PBMC counts within 1 h after thawing of the PBMC (\u201cfresh\u201d) to viable cells recovered after the 20 h resting period. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining was used to distinguish between live and dead cells. As shown in Figure 5, losses were seen for all but one of the 25 PBMC samples, and overall losses occurred at a similar rate, with about half of the cells lost after resting. The diminution seen was highly significant (p < 0.0001) as determined by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test. Because less than half of the originally seeded PBMC were recovered after resting for several samples, it is advisable to plan experiments that involve rested PBMC with two to three fold excess of PBMC than what is to be plated into the assay itself. Since PBMC are limiting for most clinical studies, these losses of PBMC need to be considered vs. possible benefits of assay results obtained through resting. ",

Increased responses to CEF in conjunction with decreased mumps responses after resting (e.g., donor 3 in Figure 4) might result from more rapid dying off of CD4 cells.

To evaluate this hypothesis directly, we plated unrested PBMC in two-fold serial dilutions and asked if observed CEF and mumps antigen-specific SFU show a linear increase proportional to the number of cells assayed. The data presented in Figure 7 suggest that in the 0.1 to 0.8 million PBMC per well range there is a high degree of linearity between the numbers of PBMC plated and the observed SFU both in the CD8 (Panel A) and CD4 (Panel B) compartments. This linear relationship between spot counts and PBMC numbers (in the range of 100,000\u2013800,000 cells/well) was confirmed in nine independent experiments using different antigens and PBMC of different donors (data not shown). Therefore, by doubling or tripling the numbers of freshly thawed PBMC plated into an ELISPOT assay one can predictably accomplish what resting does not, and in spite of the increased cell numbers needed, this strategy does not require more cells than resting does.

In the second study [25], data are shown for four healthy donors, who were assessed for responses to CEF and CMV. Of these, only one (D4) was in the low responder category by our definition\u2014no benefit of resting was seen for this donor. The remaining three donors were CEF or CMV high responders by our definition\u2014an approximately two-fold increase was seen in two high responders. Janetzki et al.

In another report resting was positively correlated with the detection of low frequency CD8 cells [26], but this study was inconclusive about resting itself because resting was just one of several assay parameters in which the compared results differed. Increasing the numbers of cells plated was another assay parameter in which the results differed, which in itself suffices to predictably improve the signal to noise performance of the assay (Figure 7 in our study). Overall, in that study PBMC of 7 donors were tested for reactivity to CMV and flu peptides of which three possessed CMV-specific CD8 cells, and five responded to the flu peptides.

Resting caused a predictable gain in assay sensitivity for CD8 responses of high-magnitude alone. This gain was on average less than two-fold, and while statistically significant, it might have limited significance in immune diagnostic terms as the responses that are enhanced through resting are already clear-cut without resting. Also, the added labor and increased need for sample material might not be justified. Importantly, the responses seen with freshly isolated (non-cryopreserved) PBMC correspond with responses seen with freshly thawed, unrested PBMC (Figure 1 C,D). Therefore the enhancement obscures the sought after ex vivo frequencies of antigen-reactive T cells. For low magnitude CD8 responses, and for CD4 reactivity of all magnitudes, resting had an unpredictable effect: decreased or unchanged reactivity was seen just as frequently as instances of increased reactivity. In contrast, doubling the number of freshly thawed PBMC predictably doubles the signal-to-noise performance of ELISPOT assays. Therefore, by doubling the number of freshly thawed PBMC plated in an ELISPOT assay one can reliably accomplish accurate monitoring of both high- and low magnitude responses derived from CD8 and CD4 cells alike, with less labor, and with the same amount of cell material.

The PBMC of the patients with Stage III and IV follicular lymphoma that in addition received chemotherapy [24] are likely to fall into this category. Furthermore, the numbers of apoptotic cells can be elevated if the samples were shipped under suboptimal conditions or requiring long transit periods, or were stored under suboptimal conditions before freezing. In our experience, human PBMC should never be chilled but shipped (as heparinized full blood) and processed (washed) warm. If apoptotic cells are present in PBMC in significant numbers, these, being still alive, will be stained and counted as live cells, but they will be dead by the time the functional assay is performed. Therefore, without accounting for apoptotic cells, one would plate fewer functional PBMC than the live cell count suggests, and the frequency of SFU will be accordingly decreased. After resting, with the apoptotic population gone, the relative frequency of functional T cells will be increased, and subsequently also the spot count. Apoptotic cells can be selectively stained by dyes such as Jo-Pro. Therefore, we support the CIMT (Association for Cancer Immunotherapy) suggestion to include counting of apoptotic cells into the immune monitoring routine [26].",

If they are passive, adjusting the counts of freshly thawed cells to functional cells (viable minus apoptotic) might accomplish in a simpler way what resting does. If apoptotic cells are inhibitory, however, selective depletion of such cells or resting will be required to improve the performance of PBMC samples that contain significant numbers of apoptotic cells. Unlike necrosis that triggers inflammation, apoptosis is an intrinsically non-phlogistic process [33]. Apoptotic cells can suppress proinflammatory responses of neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes, and can elicit an anti-inflammatory response by these cells [34,35]. The active secretion of lactoferrin by cells undergoing apoptosis is one of the key mechanisms by which apoptotic cells instruct the innate immune system [36]. Lactoferrin binds to receptors on phagocytes and inhibits their pro-inflammatory responses via NF-\u03baB [37]. Thus, lactoferrin can inhibit production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [37,38], and can induce the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines including TGF-\u03b2, IL-4 and IL-10 [39,40]. It will need to be established experimentally whether and how the presence of cells undergoing apoptosis in PBMC affect T cells in functional assays such as ELISPOT or ICS. ",

Similarly, resting might be of benefit if the serum contains cytokines that stimulate cells of the innate immune system to produce the analyte.

In such cases, the background in the medium control will be high. IFN-\u03b3 spots produced by antigen\u2011stimulated T cells are typically larger than IFN-\u03b3 spots produced by cells of the innate immune system and therefore can be identified by proper gating strategies during ELISPOT analysis. Because several of the above cell lineages of the innate system are plastic adherent, these will be depleted during the resting step, resulting in a lower background.

The cells were thawed following a protocol that we have established to provide the optimal recovery and functionality for cryopreserved PBMC [41]. Specifically, to rapidly warm up to 37 \u00b0C, the cryovials were placed for 8 minutes into a 37 \u00b0C bead bath (CTL-BB-001). The cryovials were inverted twice to resuspend the cells, and the 1 mL cell suspension contained in each cryovial (10 million cells) was gently aspirated utilizing a wide-bore 2 mL pipette and transferred into a 15 mL V bottom Falcon tube. To recover the residual cells, the cryovials were rinsed by adding 1 mL 37 \u00b0C warm CTL Anti-Aggregate Wash\u2122 Medium (CTL-AA-005) that contains benzonase. Additional 8 mL CTL Anti-Aggregate Wash\u2122 Medium at 37 \u00b0C were added to the 15 mL tube at a rate of 2 mL per 5 seconds. Before washing, an aliquot of these PBMC was counted by fluorescence microscopy using acridine orange and ethidium bromide (AO/EB) to stain live and dead cells respectively. Apoptotic cells were stained with Jo-Pro (Invitrogen) and counted similarly. PBMC were washed twice in 10 mL CTL-Test\u2122 Medium (CTLT-005) and resuspended at a final concentration of 3 \u00d7 106 PBMC/mL in the same medium. When testing the freshly thawed PBMC (we refer to such cells as \u201cfresh\u201d in this paper), these cells were plated onto an ELISPOT assay plate within 1 h of thawing. For resting, cells were incubated for 20 h at 37 \u00b0C at a concentration of 3 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in CTL-Test Medium, washed twice in CTL-Test Medium and readjusted to 3 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in this medium before plating into the ELISPOT assay.",

In contrast, considering that more than half of the cells are lost during resting, one can reliably double the signal to noise performance of T cell assays by doubling the number of freshly thawed cells plated into the assay, that is, using the amount of cells that resting would require. Doubling cell numbers when possible can both be a convenient and more accurate measure of T cell responses. While resting might be beneficial for special clinical conditions, the data presented here suggest it is clearly not advantageous or accurate in monitoring immune responses among healthy subjects, and might not be precise for samples derived from many disease states. From the unpredictable increase or decrease of T cell reactivity after resting relative to the T cell frequencies ex vivo, to potentially missing positive responses due to substantial cell losses, to the added labor and complexity of the protocol, investigators are well advised to establish whether resting indeed will benefit immune monitoring in their particular study population.
