            "text": "Molecular phylogenetics is commonly used to estimate the historical timing of evolutionary events (Yang and Rannala 2012). This is done by estimating branch lengths based on the inferred number of substitutions, and then converting these branch lengths into units of time under the assumption of a molecular clock (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965; Drummond et al. 2006). However, phylogenetic estimates of the divergence times of many viral lineages are clearly too recent (Duch\u00eane, Holmes, and Ho 2014; Ho et al. 2015; Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2016). For example, the integration of filoviruses into their host genomes indicate that Ebola and Marburg virus diverged from their common ancestor 7 to 12 million years ago\u2014but the estimate of this divergence time based on phylogenetic analyses of the viral sequences is only \u223c10,000 years ago (Carroll et al. 2013; Taylor et al. 2014). Similarly, the phylogenetic estimate of when major simian immunodeficiency virus groups diverged is almost 100 times more recent than the estimate based on the geographic isolation of their host species (Wertheim and Worobey 2009; Worobey et al. 2010). These examples, along with other similar discrepancies with measles virus (Furuse, Suzuki, and Oshitani 2010), coronavirus (Wertheim et al. 2013), and hepatitis B virus (Fares and Holmes 2002; Holmes 2003), indicate that phylogenetic methods have a systematic bias toward underestimation of deep branches.",

These genes evolve under purifying selection to maintain the structure and function of the proteins they encode. In general, these constraints are highly idiosyncratic among sites (Echave, Spielman, and Wilke 2016). However, most phylogenetic models try to account for these constraints using relatively simple approaches such as allowing the rate of substitution to vary across sites according to some statistical distribution (Yang 1994; Yang et al. 2000). These models of purifying selection are usually inadequate (Duch\u00eane et al. 2015a; Duch\u00eane, Di Giallonardo, and Holmes 2015b), potentially causing branch lengths to be severely underestimated (Halpern and Bruno 1998; Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond 2011).",

We find that ExpCMs estimate longer deep branches, and show that this extension of branch length is mostly independent and additive with that achieved by the more conventional approach of modeling rate variation. We also show that ExpCMs estimate similar branch lengths to a mutation-selection model that infers the amino-acid preferences from the natural sequence data rather than using values obtained in experiments. However, all of these mutation-selection models are limited by their failure to account for another feature of purifying selection: the fact that a site\u2019s amino-acid preferences shift over time due to epistasis. Therefore, truly accurate analyses of deep phylogenies need to account for the fact that amino-acid preferences vary across time as well as across sites.",

Standard codon models distinguish between two types of substitutions: synonymous and nonsynonymous. The relative rate of these substitutions is referred to as dN/dS or \u03c9. In their simplest form, codon substitution models fit a single \u03c9 that represents the gene-wide average fixation rate of nonsynonymous mutations relative to synonymous ones. Here we will use such substitution models in the form proposed by Goldman and Yang (1994). When these models have a single gene-wide \u03c9 they are classified as M0 by Yang et al. (2000). We will refer to M0 Goldman-Yang models simply as GY94 models (Equation 1). The gene-wide \u03c9 is usually < 1 (Murrell et al. 2015), and crudely represents the fact that many amino-acid substitutions are under purifying selection.",

For instance, in the M5 variant of the GY94 model (Yang et al. 2000), \u03c9 follows a gamma distribution as shown in Fig. 1a. We will denote this model as GY94+\u0393\u03c9.

            "text": "However, the increased realism of mutation-selection models comes at the cost of an increased number of parameters. Codon substitution models with uniform stationary states have only a modest number of parameters that must be fit from the phylogenetic data. For instance, a GY94+\u0393\u03c9 model with the commonly used F3X4 stationary state has 12 parameters: two describing the shape of the gamma distribution over \u03c9, a transition-transversion rate, and nine parameters describing the nucleotide composition of the stationary state. However, mutation-selection models must additionally specify 19 parameters defining the amino-acid preferences for each site (there are 20 amino acids whose preferences are constrained to sum to one). This corresponds to 19\u00d7L parameters for a protein of length L, or 9,500 parameters for a 500-residue protein. It is challenging to obtain values for these amino-acid preference parameters in a maximum-likelihood framework without overfitting the data (Rodrigue 2013). Here we will primarily use ExpCMs, which define the site-specific amino-acid preference parameters a priori from deep mutational scanning experiments so that they do not need to be fit from phylogenetic data (see Section 4 and Bloom 2014a, 2017; Hilton, Doud, and Bloom 2017). Because the amino-acid preference parameters in an ExpCM are obtained from experiments, the number of ExpCM free parameters is similar to a non-site-specific substitution model. An alternative strategy to account for site-specific amino-acid preferences is to formally consider them as random effects across sites, rather than parameters, and infer them using Bayesian methods (Lartillot and Philippe 2004; Rodrigue and Lartillot 2014). This strategy is discussed in Section 2.6.",

The transformation from sequence divergence to branch length is trivial when the sequence identity is high. For instance, when there has only been one substitution, then the sequence identity will simply be (L\u22121)/L for a gene of L sites, and even a simple exponential model (Zuckerkandl and Pauling 1965) will correctly infer the short branch length of 1/L substitutions per site. However, as substitutions accumulate it becomes progressively more likely for multiple changes to occur at the same site. In this regime, the accuracy of the substitution model becomes critical for transforming sequence divergence into branch length. Any time-homogenous substitution model predicts that after a very large number of substitutions, two related sequences will approach some asymptotic amino-acid sequence identity. For instance, if all 20 amino acids are equally likely in the stationary state, then this asymptotic sequence identity will be 120=0.05. If the substitution model underestimates the asymptotic sequence identity then it will also underestimate long-branch lengths, since it will predict that sequences that have evolved for a very long time should be more diverged than is actually the case.",

The GY94 model predicts the same behavior for all sites, since it does not have any site-specific parameters, with an asymptotic sequence identity of 0.062. While this predicted sequence identity is higher than 120=0.05 due to redundant codon and nucleotide biases favoring certain amino acids, it is much lower than the pairwise identity of even the most diverged HAs in nature. While it is of course possible that the identity of HAs in nature would become even lower given more time, it seems biochemically improbable that it would ever become as low as 0.062. The reason is that like many proteins HA has a highly conserved structure and function that imposes constraints that cause many sites to sample only a small subset of the 20 amino acids among all known HA homologs (Nobusawa et al. 1991).\n",

For instance, Fig. 2 shows that the GY94+\u0393\u03c9 model takes longer to reach the asymptote than GY94, but that the asymptote is identical for both models. This fact holds true even if we use experimental measurements of HA\u2019s site-specific amino-acid preferences (Doud and Bloom 2016) to calculate a different \u03c9r value for each site using the method of Spielman and Wilke (2015b) (see Equation 7). Specifically, this GY94+\u03c9r model predicts that different sites will approach the asymptote at different rates, but the asymptote is always the same (Fig. 2). The invariance of the asymptotic sequence identity under different schemes for modeling \u03c9 is a fundamental feature of the mathematics of this type of reversible substitution model. These models are reversible stochastic matrices, which can be decomposed into stationary states and symmetric exchangeability matrices (Nielsen 2006). The stationary state is invariant with respect to multiplication of the symmetric exchangeability matrix by any nonzero number. Different schemes for modeling \u03c9 only multiply elements of the symmetric exchangeability matrix. Therefore, no matter how \u2018well\u2019 a model accounts for site-to-site variation in \u03c9, it will always have the same stationary state as a simple GY94 model.",

However, there was no systematic underestimation of long branches by the ExpCM and ExpCM+\u0393\u03c9 models. The improved performance of the ExpCMs is due to their modeling of the site-specific amino-acid preferences: if we parameterize ExpCMs by amino-acid preferences that have been averaged across HA sites (and so are no longer site-specific), then they perform no better than GY94 models (Fig. 3).

The topology of HA phylogenetic trees makes these sequences an interesting test case for branch-length estimation. HA consists of a number of different subtypes. Sequences within a subtype have >68 per cent amino-acid identity, but sequences in different subtypes have as little as 38 per cent identity. However, HA proteins from all subtypes have a highly conserved structure that performs a highly conserved function (Ha et al. 2002; Russell et al. 2004). We used RAxML (Stamatakis 2006) with a nucleotide substitution model (GTRCAT) to infer a phylogenetic tree for 92 HA sequences drawn from 15 of the 18 subtypes (we excluded bat influenza and one other rare subtype). For the rest of this article, we fix the tree topology to this RAxML-inferred tree. Although the nucleotide model used with RAxML to infer this tree topology is probably less accurate than codon models, the modular subtype structure of the HA phylogeny (the tree is clearly divided into widely separated clades) means that most of the phylogenetic uncertainty lies in the length of the long branches separating the subtypes rather than in the tree topology itself. We note that other genes may have phylogenetic structures that are more prone to topological uncertainty. In such cases, the accuracy of the substitution model may be important for avoiding topological errors such as long-branch attraction (Felsenstein 1978; Lartillot, Brinkmann, and Philippe 2007).",

Table 1 shows that all ExpCMs fit the actual data much better than the GY94 models. The best fit was for the ExpCM informed by the average of the H1 and H3 deep mutational scans. For all models, incorporating \u0393\u03c9 rate variation improved the fit, although even ExpCMs without \u0393\u03c9 greatly outperformed the GY94+\u0393\u03c9 model (Table 1). As mentioned in the previous section, \u03c9 is generally < 1 when a single value is fit to all sites in a gene (Murrell et al. 2015), and this is the case for all the models we tested (Table 1). However, the ExpCMs always fit an \u03c9 greater than the GY94 model, suggesting that the site-specific amino-acid preferences capture some of the purifying selection that the GY94 models can represent only via a small \u03c9. Among the models with \u0393\u03c9, the GY94+\u0393\u03c9 model fits all four \u03c9 categories to values \u226a1, but the ExpCM+\u0393\u03c9 models fit one of the \u03c9 categories to a value > 1. This increase in \u03c9 values makes sense given the different interpretation of \u03c9 for each family of models. The ExpCM \u03c9 is the relative rate of fixation of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations after accounting for the functional constraints described by the amino-acid preferences. This more realistic null model gives ExpCMs enhanced power to detect diversifying selection for amino-acid change (Bloom 2017; Rodrigue and Lartillot 2017), which is known to occur at some sites in HA due to immune selection (Bedford et al. 2014).\n",

Figure 6 shows the subtrees containing each of these sets of HA sequences. For each subtree, we examined the congruence between site-specific natural selection and the amino-acid preferences measured in the deep mutational scanning experiment using the ExpCM stringency parameter \u03b2 (Bloom 2014b; Hilton, Doud, and Bloom 2017). Values of \u03b2 that are >1 indicate that natural selection prefers the same amino acids as the experiments but with a greater stringency, suggesting strong congruence between natural selection and the experimental preferences. In contrast, values of \u03b2 that are <1 flatten the preferences, suggesting that they provide a relatively poor description of natural selection on the protein.\n",

Crucially, this problem is more fundamental than the inability of a single deep mutational scanning experiment to measure amino-acid preferences in more than one genetic background.

This is a direct apple-to-apples comparison, since the pbMutSel model also draws \u03c9 from a gamma-distribution (Rodrigue and Lartillot 2014). First, we compared the amino-acid preferences inferred by the pbMutSel model to the preferences measured in the experiments. Figure 7a shows that the preferences inferred by pbMutSel are quite similar to the (H1+ H3 avg) obtained by averaging the deep mutational scanning measurements for the H1 and H3 HAs. Notably, the amino-acid preferences from the pbMutSel model are more correlated with the (H1+ H3 avg) than the H1 and H3 measurements are with each other (Fig. 7a). This strong correlation indicates that the ExpCM(H1+H3 avg)+\u0393\u03c9 is unlikely to be much different than a pbMutSel model that is parameterized only using the natural sequence data.\n",

As shown in Fig. 7b, these two models estimated similar branch lengths across the entire HA phylogenetic tree. However, the estimates are not identical, and the tension between local and global accuracy of the amino-acid preferences is still apparent. Specifically, the branches leading to the H1 or H3 sequences used in the experiments were estimated to be slightly longer by the ExpCM, while some other branches were estimated to be slightly longer by the pbMutSel model. The relatively longer branches leading to the experimental sequences when using the ExpCM(H1+H3 avg)+\u0393\u03c9 suggests that the \u2018tree average\u2019 amino-acid preferences inferred by the pbMutSel model are not as accurate as the preferences from the deep mutational scanning for sequences close to those used in the experiments. However, for sequences distant from those used in the experiments, the \u2018tree average\u2019 preferences inferred by the pbMutSel model appear to be slightly better than the experimental values. Therefore, while the ExpCM and pbMutSel models differ slightly in the extent to which they lengthen different branches, neither model can avoid the tension between the local and global accuracy of amino-acid preferences.",

We found that models that account for site-specific amino-acid preferences estimated deeper long branches, regardless of whether these preferences are measured experimentally or inferred from the sequence alignment.

There are now two ways to account for this fact: using models informed by deep mutational scanning experiments, or using models that infer site-specific amino-acid preferences from the natural sequence alignment. Combining either type of model with rate variation increases the inferred length of deep branches relative to models that only incorporate rate variation. We expect that further improvements could be achieved by also incorporating other factors such as host-specific substitution rates (Worobey, Han, and Rambaut 2014) that are known to be important for modeling the evolution of viral genes such as HA.",

In the case of the experimentally informed models, it is fairly obvious why this is true: the amino-acid preferences are measured in just one genetic background, and therefore provide only a single snapshot of preferences that shift over evolutionary time due to epistasis (Pollock, Thiltgen, and Goldstein 2012; Bazykin 2015; Doud, Ashenberg, and Bloom 2015; Shah, McCandlish, and Plotkin 2015; Haddox et al. 2018; Starr et al. 2018). As a result, experimentally measured amino-acid preferences are most accurate for sequences similar to the one used in the experiment, and so cause the largest increases in branch length in that region of the phylogenetic tree. However, this limitation is not unique to experimentally informed models, but is a general limitation of describing purifying selection using a single set of site-independent and time-homogenous amino-acid preferences. For instance, we showed that averaging experimental measurements on two protein homologs does a somewhat better job of capturing the \u2018average\u2019 constraint across the tree, and performs similarly to approaches that infer the \u2018average\u2019 preferences from natural sequence data (Rodrigue, Philippe, and Lartillot 2010; Rodrigue and Lartillot 2014).

            "text": "So while modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences is a clear improvement over most conventional models, the next step toward greater accuracy will require relaxing the assumption that these preferences are time homogeneous and site independent. Of course, many authors have pointed out the shortcomings of models that fail to account for the full site-interdependent complexity of purifying selection (Rodrigue et al. 2005; Choi et al. 2007; Pollock, Thiltgen, and Goldstein 2012; Goldstein and Pollock 2017). However, the challenge is to overcome these shortcomings with models that are tractable for real phylogenetic questions. There are two main issues: first, the Felsenstein pruning algorithm (Felsenstein 1981) that is typically used to evaluate phylogenetic likelihoods breaks down when sites are no longer treated independently. Some alternative algorithms have been proposed (Choi et al. 2007; Rodrigue et al. 2009, 2005; Bordner and Mittelmann 2014), but they are still in their infancy. Second, site-interdependent models require a realistic \u2018fitness function\u2019 that describes the interactions among sites. It appears that typical structural modeling programs are insufficient for this purpose (Rodrigue et al. 2009). But hope comes from experimental progress in measuring actual site-interdependent constraints on proteins (Olson, Wu, and Sun 2014; Li et al. 2016; Steinberg and Ostermeier 2016; Wu et al. 2016), combined with new methods for using these measurements to parameterize fitness functions (Sailer and Harms 2017; Otwinowski, McCandlish, and Plotkin 2018). Perhaps some day such truly realistic models might be useful for phylogenetic inference. Until that day, our work shows that modeling a single set of time homogenous amino-acid preferences provides at least some improvement.",

(a) The dN/dS parameter, \u03c9, can be defined as one gene-wide average (orange triangle) or allowed to vary according to some statistical distribution (blue line). For computational tractability, the distribution is discretized into K bins and \u03c9 takes on the mean of each bin (blue circles) (Yang 1994; Yang et al. 2000). A gamma distribution (denoted by \u0393) with K = 4 bins is shown here. (b) A substitution model\u2019s stationary state defines the expected sequence composition after a very long evolutionary time. Most substitution models have stationary states that are uniform across sites. However, substitution models can have site-specific stationary states. In the logo plots, each column is a site in the protein and the height of each letter is the frequency of that amino acid at stationary state. (c) Substitution models can incorporate neither, one, or both of these features. Here we will use substitution models from the Goldman-Yang (GY94; Goldman and Yang 1994; Yang et al. 2000) and ExpCM (Hilton, Doud, and Bloom 2017) families with and without gamma-distributed \u03c9 to represent all possible combinations.",

The logo plots at top show the amino-acid preferences for some sites in an H1 influenza HA protein as experimentally measured by Doud and Bloom (2016). The graphs show the expected amino-acid identity at that site for two sequences separated by a branch of the indicated length (Equation 9). For the GY94 model, the graphs are identical for all sites since this model does not have site-specific parameters; the same is true for GY94+\u0393\u03c9. The graphs do differ among sites if we calculate a different \u03c9r for each site r in the GY94 model using the amino-acid preferences (Equation 7; Spielman and Wilke 2015b). However, all GY94 models, including the one with site-specific \u03c9r values, approach the same asymptote since they all have the same stationary state. The ExpCM has different asymptotes for different sites since it accounts for how amino-acid preferences lead to site-specific stationary states.",

We then inferred the branch lengths of this tree from the simulated alignments. The inferred branch lengths for various models are plotted on the x-axis, and the actual branch lengths used in the simulations are on the y-axis. We performed 10 simulations and inferences, and gray points show each inferred branch length from each simulation, and black points show the average of each branch length across simulations.

We fit an ExpCM informed by the H1 or H3 deep mutational scanning experiments to trees spanning sequences with low, intermediate, and high divergence from the sequence used in the experiment. The ExpCM stringency parameter (\u03b2) is a measure of the congruence between natural selection and the experimental measurements (Bloom 2014b; Hilton, Doud, and Bloom 2017). Larger values of \u03b2 indicate that natural selection prefers the same amino acids as the experiments but with greater stringency. As divergence increases between the HA used in the experiment and the other sequences in the tree, the \u03b2 value decreases and the amino-acid preference \u2018flatten\u2019. Therefore, the preferences measured in each experiment are progressively less congruent with natural selection as we include increasingly diverged sequences.",

The pbMutSel amino-acid preferences are inferred from the natural HA sequences, while the ExpCM amino-acid preferences are experimentally measured and then rescaled by the stringency parameter in Table 1. (a) The pbMutSel preferences are more correlated with the re-scaled average of the H1 and H3 deep mutational scanning preferences than the individual re-scaled H1 and H3 deep mutational scanning preferences are to each other (Pearson\u2019s r: 0.74 versus 0.52). (b) The ExpCM(H1+H3 avg)+\u0393\u03c9 and pbMutSel models estimated similar branch lengths when fit to the entire HA tree. Points denote branch lengths between all pairs of tips on the tree. Blue and orange denote branches that lead to the H1 and H3 deep mutational scanning reference sequences respectively. The phydms program implementing ExpCMs and the PhyloBayes-MPI program implementing pbMutSel models give branch lengths in different units, so to facilitate direct comparison between the models, we have normalized all branch lengths returned by each program by the length of the branches separating the earliest (A/South Carolina/1918) and latest (A/Solomon Islands/2006) seasonal human H1 sequences on the tree.",
