            "text": "There are two major approaches to model the spreading of an infectious disease in a space-structured population that are mostly used in recent literature: the Individual Based Models (IBM) and the Metapopualtion Models. The first ones [1]\u2013[4] are obtained by coupling a transmission model with a highly detailed socio-demographic model, based on a thorough knowledge of the population structure and its distribution in age-classes, household size, school size, employments, etc. An appropriate set of social contact groups is associated to each individual according to her/his age. The epidemiological state of any individual is updated at each time step, typically assuming a homogeneous mixing within each context. The Metapopulation models [5]\u2013[12] are mainly focused on the role of human mobility, and involve a very accurate knowledge of the mobility fluxes between different sub-populations (transportation infrastructures, long-range airline connections, short range daily commuting pattern, etc.). In each sub-population, the disease typically propagates according to a discrete stochastic model with homogeneous mixing. Both these large-scale approaches are extremely fascinating, realistic and predictive. Comparative studies also prove the two approaches to be in good agreement with each other [13]. However, the price to pay for the realism of these models is the high computational cost and their non trivial generalizability, due to the huge amount of input data necessary to achieve a realistic description of the populations living in different geographic areas, and/or their connections at global level.",

Individuals typically have contacts with a finite number of other individuals and the number and identity of contacts change in time. Epidemic models formulated on networks naturally include heterogeneity. In these models, the disease transmission network is drawn over the underlying network of contacts (i.e. the socio-demographic model). The literature on the epidemic spreading on networks is extensive (e.g. [16]\u2013[22]) and it mostly consists of models formulated on static networks. Dynamic contacts are instead allowed in the neighbor exchange model of Ref. [23], where each individual has a fixed number of contacts, but the identities of contacts change in time. In Ref. [24], susceptibles can avoid contacts with infected individuals by rewiring their connections and changing the identity of their contacts. This is an example of adaptive behavior where the dynamics of contacts is induced by the epidemic itself. The epidemic spreading on dynamic small world networks is also discussed in Refs. [25]\u2013[27]. Comparative studies on the effect of dynamics on small world network [28] show that the risk of an outbreak on dynamic network is higher than in static models.",

[29], a SIRS model is formulated on a regular lattice, in which, each site is occupied by an individual, and all the individuals have the same number of contacts, with fixed identity. The dynamical variables of the model are those related to the infection, and change according to the state of the nearest neighbors. In our model, instead, the existence of empty sites allows heterogeneity in the number of contacts. Furthermore individuals change the number and identities of their contacts, by moving from a site to a nearest neighbor empty site according to certain mobility rules.",

This is the basic idea of the social contact hypothesis, which assumes that the age specific number of potentially infectious contacts is proportional to the self reported number of social contacts in each age-class [30]. In the Polymod project [31], a diary-based large scale survey of epidemiologically relevant contact patterns was performed in 8 EU countries. The country dependent contact matrices,  (i.e. the average number of daily contacts that an individual in the age-class j has with individuals in the age-class i) were obtained from the self reported number of social contacts in each age-class. The dominant feature of these contact matrices, all over Europe, is the large diagonal elements (larger in the 5\u201324 age-class than in the adult ones), which indicate that individuals prefer contacts with individuals belonging to the same age-class, i.e they have an assortative behavior. A strong assortative behavior is also found in Ref. [32], where authors generate synthetic contact matrices through an IBM model, by coupling information obtained from the Italian time-use data (carried out by the ISTAT - www.istat.it), and socio-demographic data, and compare the results with questionnaire-based contact matrices.",

Our crucial hypothesis is that a detailed microscopic knowledge of the population structure, although powerful and fascinating, is not strictly necessary in order to reproduce the spreading of an infectious disease, which is instead essentially regulated by the average contact patterns of individuals. Under this hypothesis, any model, which is able to reproduce such patterns, may in principle predict the epidemics dynamics, if some disease dependent parameters are provided. The focus on the contact patterns is a novelty with respect to Ref. [37], where the parameters controlling the dynamics were fixed a priori, and the daily numbers of contacts were not compared with experimental data. In the present paper, for different lattice topologies, the parameters, which regulate the pattern dynamics, are instead fixed in order to obtain the best agreement with the Polymod data. The socio-demographic model is then coupled with a SIR model with a nearest neighbor interaction for the spreading of the infection. The model is checked on the Italian epidemiological data for the influenza A(H1N1) during the 2009/2010 season. If the accordance between the contact numbers of the model and the Polymod data is satisfactory, a good agreement is also found between the numerical and the experimental epidemiological data.",

One should first observe that the Italian Government data we are comparing with, are those relative to the illness consultations and not to the ascertained cases. A direct and more reliable measure of the incidence of infection in the population would have been obtained by comparing the presence of antibodies in serum samples before and after the pandemic (e.g. [44]). However, in our knowledge such kind of analysis has not been performed for the Italian case and thus age-classes immunity data are not available. Moreover, also pharyngeal swabs on ILI cases have not been performed systematically, so that a reliable statistic on positive cases is not available. Illness consultations are of course a much more reliable estimate of the real epidemic diffusion during the epidemic peak (when the alert of population and public health system is utmost) but they are less significant at the beginning and at the end of the epidemic. Therefore, part of the disagreement at the beginning of the outbreak for the age-class 5\u201314 (that is the one mostly involved into the epidemic) may be due to an underestimation of the influenza diffusion at that time, since not all the cases of influenza like symptoms led to illness consultations, as instead it mostly happened during the peak. Part of the disagreement in the descendant phase for the age group 5\u201314 may be instead due to self-initiated health care measures carried out by many Italian families. Indeed, even if no closure of schools was decided by the Italian Government, the spread of fear during the peak (also due to a strong media campaign), induced many families to keep children at home, drastically reducing their scholar and extra scholar activities during that period.",

In particular, with this alternative procedure, there would be no constraints on the total number of contacts (unless introducing other fitting parameters to fix them) with the result that the total contacts could assume values very different from the Polymod data. We performed a set of such simulations and found an improvement in the assortativity of young people, and a worsening in that of adults and elderly people. However, no significant improvement of the agreement between the epidemiological data and the simulated ones were observed in this different setup, giving the two procedures essentially similar results.

Therefore, short episodes of contacts are on the same footing as long standing contacts. This simplification is quite reasonable for viral diseases, as influenza, for which even short contacts can be sufficient for the transmission process. For other kind of infections, as the bacterial ones, the time of exposure is relevant for the transmission and thus one should properly include it in the model. Moreover, in the present study, the infectivity of the individuals is assumed to be constant during the entire infective period. In principle, one should consider the reduction of the viral load during the manifestation of the disease. There are examples in literature, in which the infectivity is a function of the time elapsed from the beginning of the infective period, as in Ref. [2], where the infectivity is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution. Similarly, we do not consider the effect of the simultaneous presence of more than one infected individual in the neighborhood of the susceptible one: the probability of an individual to be infected does not depend on the number of her/his nearest neighbors, which are simultaneously infected, but only on the age-class of the susceptible individual. Both these simplifications correspond to disregard the effect of the viral load in the infection process, which is indeed entirely ascribed to the immunological status of the susceptible individual. To disregard the viral load in the transmission process is acceptable for highly infective disease, as the influenza pandemic. However, the model can be easily \u201cupgraded\u201d in order to overcome all the previous limits, introducing a susceptible-infector dependent transmission rate, a variable infectivity, and to make the transmission rate dependent on the number of simultaneously infected nearest neighbors.",

Our model belongs to the class of epidemiological models, which adopt the social contact hypothesis as the leading key to interpret and reproduce the contagion process. Being in countertrend with respect to the mostly used approaches in recent literature (I.e. IBM and Metapopulation models), which involve highly detailed socio-demographic/mobility models and require an huge amount of input data, we believe that such a simple model could open a valuable alternative perspective with respect to the mostly used \u201crealistic\u201d epidemiological models.",
