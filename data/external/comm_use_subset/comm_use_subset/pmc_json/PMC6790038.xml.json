For example, the proportion of patients who require mechanical ventilation during their ICU stay is 3-fold higher than the proportion of patients admitted for a respiratory condition [10, 11]. Because of this, the majority of patients admitted to the ICU undergo some form of chest imaging, typically a chest radiograph (CXR), early in their hospital course.

The upper and lower quadrants for each lung were determined by the level of the carina. Each quadrant was assigned a score from 0 to 4 with 0 = normal, 1 = hazy opacification of less than half the quadrant, 2 = dense opacification of less than half the quadrant, 3 = hazy opacification of more than half the quadrant, and 4 = dense opacification of more than half the quadrant. Opacification was considered dense if the rib margins were obscured by the infiltrate. The total score, ranging from 0 to 16, was the sum of the four quadrants (Fig. 2). If the subject initially presented to another facility and the only image available for the first 24 h was obtained there, then the image from the facility of presentation was used (n = 6).
