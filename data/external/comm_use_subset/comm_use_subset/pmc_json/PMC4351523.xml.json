Japanese macaques at KUPRI were kept separately according to where they originated and the letters (e.g., TH, AR, and HG) before each individual number represent the birthplace of the animal or its ancestors. Onset was determined on the basis of decreased PLT counts or the pathological findings at necropsy. The disease progressed extremely rapidly after the onset (death within zero to a few days), and in some macaques, the disease was detected only after death; thus, blood data were not available for these individuals. Severely decreased PLT counts and lowered WBC and RBC counts were found in all macaques that developed the disease, with PLT counts close to zero at the time of death in nearly all cases. Blood data from healthy Japanese macaques kept at KUPRI showed that the normal levels were PLT counts of 29.0 \u00b1 7.8 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl, WBC counts of 12.2 \u00b1 3.8 \u00d7 102/\u03bcl, and RBC counts of 505 \u00b1 37 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl. These data indicated that the macaques that contracted the disease had extreme anemia. The Japanese macaques that contracted the disease did not share any attributes such as sex, birthplace, age, or genealogy. Life prolongation was possible to some extent with blood transfusion, but treatments with any drugs or antibiotics had no effect at all. As a result, many diseased macaques were euthanized from November 2009 onward, and samples were collected from them. After the onset occurred, the fatality rate was extremely high and only one macaque survived each outbreak. PLT counts recovered in these two macaques.",

However, blood data were monitored in some macaques (ID: HGN155, HGN156, HGN161 and WK1649) that were kept in the same breeding rooms as the macaques that contracted the disease. These data showed that PLT counts were maintained at 10 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl or above from two weeks to ten days before the onset, after which they dropped rapidly. Furthermore, PLT and WBC counts dropped before RBC counts decreased. However, no remarkable changes were noted in any other serum biochemical values, and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, did not increase in any macaque that contracted the disease (data not shown).",

Both macaques died two days after the first examination by veterinarians. The progress of the disease was peracute in all macaques that subsequently contracted it. Excluding a few cases, all macaques exhibited systemic hemorrhagic symptoms such as those shown in Fig. 1, and they died within a few days of onset (Table 1). Only two macaques survived the two outbreaks. At the time of the first examination of the affected macaques by veterinarians, i.e., when their responsible caretakers first noticed clinical symptoms such as subcutaneous hemorrhaging or mucous and bloody stool, their PLT, WBC, and RBC counts had already dropped markedly and they had severe anemia (Table 1). Since PLT counts had dropped to below 1 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl, the clinical findings of subcutaneous hemorrhage, mucous and bloody stool, and gingival hemorrhage were considered to be consequences of their decreased PLT counts. On the other hand, five macaques (ID: AR2182, TH1439, HGN160, HGN267 and HGN165) that were kept in the same room as the affected macaques were euthanized when their PLT counts dropped below 10 \u00d7 104/\u03bcl, because we predicted that they had a poor prognosis. However, four of these macaques maintained their PLT counts to some degree at the time of euthanasia, and necropsy showed that the hemorrhage lesions were mild. It is possible that these macaques may not have progressed to onset, i.e. PLT counts may not have become near zero. Therefore it is doubtful whether these macaques should be included in the same category as the severely affected macaques. Because this is the first report of infectious thrombocytopenia in Japanese macaques, all data from the macaques that possibly developed the disease are shown in Table 1, but further investigations are needed to determine specific criteria for onset.",

However, all macaques were negative for the antibodies against those pathogens. The antibody tests for eight macaque pathogens indicated no clear correlations between the onset and control groups, and no cause-and-effect relationships could be demonstrated for any of the pathogens. All affected macaques were negative for the anti-SRV antibody. These same examinations were also performed on the seven macaques affected in the first outbreak, all of which tested negative for the anti-SRV antibody. It has been reported that anti-SRV antibodies may not have been produced in a small subset of cynomolgus macaques infected with SRV7. we could not assume that no affected Japanese macaques had produced such antibodies at all, and thus, we excluded SRV as a causative virus.

Therefore we handed the samples, which had been stored relatively in the large amount, to the several organizations and carried out the different examination at each organization. Although the results that each examination provided were not necessarily enough, we obtained the evidence suggesting a close association between SRV-4 and thrombocytopenia in the Japanese macaques. Our investigations demonstrated as follows: Large numbers of viruses with retrovirus-like morphology were present in the plasma of the Japanese macaques that developed thrombocytopenia. In addition, SRV-4 genomes were confirmed in the plasma of all affected macaques and SRV-4 was isolated from PBMCs at the Corporation for Production and Research of Laboratory Primates. Later, SRV-4 was also isolated from the plasma, feces, and bone marrow cells of a Japanese macaque that exhibited severe thrombocytopenia at the Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University (unpublished data). In contrast, SRV-4 genomes were not detected in macaques that were raised at the second campus and who had no contact at all with the affected macaques. Furthermore, no candidate pathogens other than SRV-4 could be detected in the affected macaques despite the use of the RDV method, electron microscopy and virus isolation. Since the RDV method is used to comprehensively detect viral genomes, it is extremely significant that RDV could not detect any other candidates. Metagenomic analysis for RNA also only detected SRV-4 in the affected macaque (ID: TBN201), which was not used for above-mentioned examinations. This fact strongly supports that SRV-4 is the causative agent of thrombocytopenia in Japanese macaques. Additional research is required to determine whether this disease occurs with SRV-4 alone or whether some co-factors are associated with thrombocytopenia; however, it is clear that SRV-4 was the principal agent responsible for this disease.",

Various species of macaques, including cynomolgus macaques, have been kept at KUPRI since their introduction from other facilities; thus, we assume that these translocated macaques brought SRV-4 to KUPRI. More than one species of macaque has sometimes been kept in the same room depending on the research purpose, and injured or diseased macaques may have been hospitalized in the same room for medical treatments, although they were kept in different cages. It is likely that SRV-4 was transmitted from a carrier cynomolgus macaque to a Japanese macaque in the past, and that only Japanese macaques developed severe thrombocytopenia as a consequence.",

            "text": "SRV has been identified as the etiology of an infectious immunosuppressive syndrome, so-called Simian AIDS, in several species of macaques at primate research centers in USA such as the Washington National Primate Research Center and the California National Primate Research Center8. It was also reported that SRV-induced immunosupression brought on neoplastic diseases in infected macaques. For instance, SRV-2 is specifically associated with a proliferative condition called retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF) of infected macaques, including pigtailed macaques, crab-eating macaque, rhesus macaques, and Celebes macaques. In these, pigtailed macaques are most susceptible and their clinical symptoms are severe. It is suspected that RF is due to a gammaherpesvirus acting as cofactors secondary to SRV infection and immune suppression. Recently pathogenicities of SRV-4 have been reported4513. SRV-4 is usually asymptomatic when it infects cynomolgus macaques, but may cause immunosuppression marked by chronic diarrhea and some macaques may exhibit mild thrombocytopenia. However, thrombocytopenia in cynomolgus macaques is not inevitable and the disease can also progress chronically. In this way, no cases of the peracute thrombocytopenia seen in the Japanese macaques have been reported. We consider that the virus in the cynomolgus macaque crossed the so-called species barrier and infected and spread to Japanese macaques, causing severe thrombocytopenia. It is a well-known fact that crossing the species barrier increases pathogen virulence14. Viruses such as the avian influenza virus15 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus16 exhibited strong pathogenicity after crossing the species barrier from their natural hosts to humans. In NHPs, herpesvirus saimiri can spread from naturally infected squirrel monkeys to other new world monkeys, causing serious lymphoma17. After crossing the species barrier into new hosts, the virus exhibits unexpectedly severe symptoms that are not observed in the original hosts. In most cases, the new hosts are distantly related to the original host1516. In the case of SRV-4, however, although the virus spread from cynomolgus macaques to Japanese macaques, which are closely related and both belong to the fascicularis group of the genus Macaca (hybridization may also occur between the two species), extremely severe acute symptoms developed. This disease merits attention because it has changed our concept of the relationship between species barriers, genetic distance and virulence.",

Nearly 30 years have passed since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the development of an animal model was urgently required at the time of its discovery1819. As mentioned above, SRV causes immunosuppression in infected macaques; thus, it was used as a model of AIDS2021. Indeed, a large amount of research was conducted using SRV from the mid-1980s to the 1990s, and many reports have been published822. Serotypes 1 to 5 were also discovered at an early stage23. However, after it was discovered that HIV was the result of a cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)2425, interests of researchers were immediately shifted from SRV to SIV, and a few reports on SRV have been published recently. SRV is a relatively small RNA virus with a full length of just over 8,000 base pairs, but the full sequence of the SRV-4 genome was only reported in 20104. Thus, the reason why we required a long period of time to detect the cause of the disease was not only the fact that the affected macaques did not produce antibodies but also because an effective molecular diagnosis method had not been developed.",

Thus, we have held the biased view that \u201cSRV could not cause such a severe disease.\u201d Many cynomolgus macaques are imported into Japan every year for experimental purposes; however, SRV is not included among the items in the imported quarantine inspection and few facilities can screen for it independently. In animal facilities in Japan, several species of macaques are often kept in the same room because of lack of space and other reasons. Moreover, Japanese macaques and cynomolgus macaques are also often kept in adjacent cages in zoos in Japan. Nevertheless, similar disease outbreaks have not been reported at other facilities. These facts, as well as the severe symptoms, led us to believe that an unknown pathogen was involved. The article that introduced this disease in Nature mentioned that, \u201cBecause Japanese laboratories tend to have excellent diagnostic capabilities, the illness is probably not due to any of the known agents\u201d2. We still have reservations about why this thrombocytopenia occurred only at KUPRI and whether SRV-4 alone can actually cause this disease. In light of this, it may be said that the metagenomic analysis and the RDV method, which objectively detected the viral genome, are epoch-making diagnostic techniques.",

However, experimental infection would be dangerous in this case because the symptoms of this disease are extremely severe and no treatment has been established. More than eight hundreds of Japanese macaques are reared in KUPRI, but we don't have a suitable facility for experimental infection of viral pathogens in KUPURI. Therefore, our colleagues in Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, have performed experimental infections at the P3A level animal facility in their Institute. SRV-4 from one of the affected Japanese macaques as well as an infectious molecular clone derived from isolated SRV-4 were inoculated into Japanese macaques. As a result, the isolate induced severe thrombocytopenia in all four macaques within 37 days. Infectious molecular clone-derived virus could also develop same symptoms (unpublished data).",

The pathology, mechanism of onset, and natural host of this disease must be clarified. In addition, the establishment of the diagnostic method and construction of the quarantine inspection system should be done urgently. ELISA is usually a simple, easy and extremely effective diagnostic method for infectious disease. However it is revealed that no specific antibody against SRV-4 was detected in affected macaques. Therefore molecular diagnosis for SRV, such as PCR for proviral DNA or RT-PCR for viral genome, is effective. The pathogenicity for Japanese macaques of SRV-4 variants or other serotypes is still unclear, but the molecular diagnostic methods that can detect them will be necessary. As described above, Japan is importing more than 5000 cynomolgus macaques every year from Southeast Asia where the prevalence of SRV may be quite high. However SRV is not included among the items in the imported quarantine inspection. Unrecognized co-infection with SRV in the biomedical model may severely compromise the integrity of toxicology studies. SRV infection is a threat not only against the Japanese macaque but also against biomedical researches. Importers and researchers using cynomolgus macaques should carry out inspection of SRV absolutely. In future, some kind of legal regulation may be necessary.",

There is no report on SRV-associated thrombocytopenia of humans even from Southeast Asia, where wild macaques are naturally infected with SRV and humans may come into close contact with those macaques regularly. Therefore SRV-4 is less likely to cause thrombocytopenia in humans. In this study, however, we isolated SRV-4 using the Raji cell line, which is the continuous human cell line from hematopoietic origin.
