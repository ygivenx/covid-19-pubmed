Despite the great importance of RV to public health, the molecular mechanisms underlying RV pathogenicity remain poorly understood. Only humans are the natural hosts for RV, but cell lines from monkeys, hamsters and rabbits such as Vero, BHK, and RK-13, respectively, are commonly used for isolation or propagation of RV, because RV replicates most efficiently in these cell lines2\u20134. Understanding the cell types targeted by RV and the molecular basis for determining viral tropism is an important step for understanding the pathophysiology of rubella and CRS. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) has been recently identified as a receptor for RV5. However, MOG is expressed mainly in cells of central nervous system, and its expression is very low or undetectable in the cells from other organs or tissues. Since RV generally causes a systemic infection, the pathology of rubella and CRS cannot be simply explained by the distribution pattern of MOG. Previous studies have indicated that membrane phospholipids and glycolipids, rather than cellular surface proteins, support RV infection, suggesting a functional role for membrane lipids in RV infections6, 7.",

            "text": "Measuring the infectivity titer of a virus is fundamental in virus research. However, infectivity titers are not absolute values and are dependent on the host cells used to determine such titers. The host cells must be both susceptible and permissible for virus infection establishment. Therefore, even when the viral titer of a particular sample is measured in different cell lines, it may differ greatly. In this experiment, we have determined the 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID50) by using a limiting dilution method, in which multiple rounds of infection is allowed. However, the CCID50 in this method is basically expected to show the first cell numbers infected with RV. Indeed, even when the second round of infection was blocked by NH4Cl, similar results were obtained (Supplementary Figure 1). The infectivity titer of a stock of the recombinant RV rHS strain was determined using various human cell lines and a monkey kidney-derived cell line, Vero. Vero cells are most commonly used to determine the infectivity titer of RV. The infectivity titer of the rHS stock was 5.17 \u00d7 106 CCID50/cell when Vero cells were used. The titer was set to 100% to simplify comparison (Fig. 1A, B). When NJG, JAR and JEG3 cells were used, the infectivity titers of the same stock of rHS were 56.1%, 56.7%, and 146%, respectively (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the three trophoblast-derived cell lines were susceptible and permissible to RV infection similarly to Vero cells. In contrast, the titers were reduced to only ~4 and 18%, respectively, when HSQ89 and A549 cells were used (Fig. 1A). The titers were very low (~0.01 to 0.1%), when the other ten non-immune cell lines (SH\u2013SY5Y, SK\u2013N\u2013MC, 293T, HUEhT\u20131, Caco\u20132, HeLa, FLC\u20134, Huh7, FaDu, and Detroit562) were used (Fig. 1A). Therefore, these cell lines are almost non-susceptible or non-permissible, or both, to RV infection. The titers of the viral stock were also determined using immune cell lines. The titer was ~12% when MT2 cells were used, whereas the titers were very low (~0.01 to 0.1%) when the other five immune cell lines (U937, THP-1, Raji, M8166, and Jurkat) were tested (Fig. 1B). Therefore, RV infection is established efficiently in only some non-immune cell lines, particularly trophoblast-derived cell lines.\n",

            "text": "Data from the experiments with RV indicated that many cell lines were nearly non-susceptible or non-permissible, or both, to RV infection. To assess the susceptibilities of individual cell lines to infection with RV, pseudotype VSVs bearing RV envelope proteins were generated. The VSV pseudotype virus genomes lack the G gene, which is replaced with a reporter protein gene, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase (FLuc) gene8, 14, 18, 19. The pseudotype viruses were thus expected to show similar behaviors to RV during the process of virus entry, and the subsequent processes of gene expression are dependent on the VSV replication machinery. In the initial experiment, only RV envelope E2 and E1 proteins were provided in trans to generate the GFP gene- and FLuc gene-encoding pseudotype viruses, VSVGFP-RV/E2E1 and VSVFLuc-RV/E2E1, respectively, like other VSV pseudotype viruses13, 19\u201330. The infectivity titers for VSVGFP-RV/E2E1 and VSVFLuc-RV/E2E1 were 10-fold higher than those of the counterpart control viruses, VSVGFP-\u2206G and VSVFLuc-\u2206G, respectively, which lack envelope glycoproteins, in Vero cells (Fig. 2A, B). Although this suggests that RV envelope proteins contribute to the infectivity of the pseudotype viruses, they seem to have little practical application because of their low infective titers. Co-expression of the Capsid (C) protein resulted in production of the pseudotype viruses, VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 and VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 and these pseudotype viruses showed higher infectivity titers than VSVGFP-RV/E2E1 and VSVFLuc-RV/E2E1, respectively (Fig. 2A, B). The infectivity titers for VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 and VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 were 50\u2013200-fold higher than those of VSVGFP-\u2206G and VSVFLuc-\u2206G, respectively. An experiment indicated that the RV C protein promotes fusion activity in RV envelope (E1 and E2) proteins by supporting the maturation or stabilizing either E2 and E1 or their interactions during intracellular transport to the cell surface31. We have confirmed the enhance effect by the C protein on fusion by RV envelope proteins. The surface expression level of the E1 protein with the C protein was similar to that without the C protein (Fig. 2C). The total amounts of the E1 protein in cells were also similar between cells co-expressed with or without the C protein (Fig. 2D). Nevertheless, the level of cell-to-cell fusion was increased by ~two-fold by co-expressing the C protein (Fig. 2E). Although the detailed mechanism was unclear, the data demonstrated that the RV envelope protein expressed on the cell surface showed a better fusion activity than that expressed without the C protein. Thus, in the following experiment, the C protein was provided together with RV envelope E2 and E1 proteins. However, it should be noted that co-expression of the C protein with the E1 and E2 proteins may produce empty non-infectious RV-like-particles (RVLP). Indeed, an electron microscopic assay revealed both bullet-shaped (~61 \u00b1 7 nm \u00d7 173 \u00b1 18 nm; n = 5) and spherical particles (~73 \u00b1 12 nm in diameter; n = 8), which were corresponding to VSV and RV virions, respectively9, 32. This suggests that pseudotype VSV and RVLP were contained in the VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 stocks (Fig. 2F). No particles showed a combined shape of the bullet and spherical forms. Although the VSV pseudotype virus genome was expected to be incorporated into the bullet shaped particles, it was confirmed by the following experiment. Stock solutions of VSVFLuc-G, VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 and RVLP were independently prepared and concentrated and fractionated by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. In this experiment, RVLP, which contains a subgenomic replicon RNA in which the structural genes are replaced with DNA sequences encoding the puromycin N-acetyl-transferase protein, the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2 A self-cleavage domain, and the Renilla luciferase33, was used as a marker for RVLP fractionation pattern. VSVFLuc-G, VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1, and RVLP in individual fractions were detected by infecting Vero cells with the fractions and measuring the relative light unit (RLU) from the cells. The peak infectivity of VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 was at ninth fraction similarly to that of VSVFLuc-G, with no peak or shoulder at seventh fraction where RVLP indicated the peak infectivity (Fig. 2G-I). The profiles demonstrated that the pseudotype VSV particles, but not RVLP, incorporated the genome.\n",

RV enters cells through receptor\u2013binding-mediated endocytosis and subsequent low pH\u2013triggered viral\u2013host membrane fusion34\u201336. To analyze the entry process of VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1, the effects of endosomal acidification inhibitors on VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1-infections were examined. Vero cells were pretreated with various concentrations of bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine, and infected with VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 and three control pseudotype VSVs bearing envelope proteins of VSV, murine leukemia virus (MLV), and measles virus (MV) (VSVFLuc-G, VSVFLuc-MLV/Env, and VSVFLuc-MV/FH, respectively). Similar to RV, entry of the authentic VSV occurs in endosomes under low pH conditions37, while MLV and MV enter cells in the plasma membrane under neutral pH38\u201340. As expected, the inhibitors blocked VSVFLuc-G infections in a dose-dependent manner, but did not block VSVFLuc-MLV/Env and VSVFLuc-MV/FH infections (Fig. 3C, D). The effect of the inhibitors on VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 was similar to that on VSVFLuc-G. Another feature of RV entry is its Ca2+ dependency35. Hence, the Ca2+ requirements of VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 infection were assessed. The number of VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1-infected cells declined severely when the level of CaCl2 in the culture media was lowered (Fig. 3E). VSVGFP-MV/FH infectivity, which was used as a control, was reduced by only ~20% at a maximum. All these data suggest that VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 undergoes a similar entry process to the authentic RV.\n",

            "text": "We analyzed VSV-RV/CE2E1, VSV-G, and VSV-\u2206G for their infectivity levels in various human cell lines and Vero cells. To compare the different pseudotype viruses, the infectivity titers were standardized by the genome copy numbers in the virus stocks. The genome copy numbers in VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1, VSVGFP-G, and VSVGFP-\u2206G stocks used in the experiments were 5.02 \u00d7 1010, 1.15 \u00d7 1011, and 4.29 \u00d7 1010, respectively, per milliliter. Also the genome copy numbers in VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1, VSVFLuc-G, and VSVFLuc-\u2206G stocks used in the experiments were 9.35 \u00d7 109, 2.81 \u00d7 1010, and 1.21 \u00d7 1010, respectively, per milliliter. VSV-G infectivity titers were generally much higher than those of VSV-RV/CE2E1 (Fig. 4). Not surprisingly, these data suggest that RV envelope proteins were less efficiently incorporated and/or less functional in VSV-based pseudotype virions than the authentic VSV G glycoprotein. Nonetheless, the VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 infectivity titers were significantly higher than VSVGFP-\u2206G in many cell lines (Fig. 4). VSVGFP-G infectivity titers in 293T, Huh7, NJG, JAR, and JEG3 cells were similar to that in Vero cells (Fig. 4A), as were the infectivity titers of VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 in 293T and NJG cells in Vero cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the infectivity titers of VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 in Huh7, JAR, and JEG3 cells were ~10-times greater than they were in Vero cells (Fig. 4A). Vero cells are commonly used for propagating RV and it is well accepted that this cell line is susceptible to RV. These data therefore suggest that these non-immune cell lines (293T, Huh7, NJG, JAR, and JEG3) are similarly or more highly susceptible to RV than Vero cells. VSVGFP-G infectivity titers were reduced by 10 to 1,000-fold in HeLa, FLC-4, FaDu, Detroit562, HSQ89, and A549 cells, when compared with the titer in Vero cells (Fig. 4A, B). Therefore, these cell lines may be less susceptible or less permissible to VSV infection. Even when considering these observations, the infectivity titers of VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 in these cells were significantly higher than those of VSVGFP-\u2206G (Fig. 4B), suggesting that these cell lines are also susceptible to RV. Similar experiments were performed using VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1, of which the infection was highly sensitively quantified by the luciferase activity. In these experiments a VSV G protein-specific antibody, which neutralized VSVFLuc-G infection efficiently, was used to eliminate the possible effect by the residual VSVFLuc-G used for the production of VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1. Data with VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 and the VSV-G neutralizing antibody confirmed the negligible or small effect by the residual VSVFLuc-G and the high susceptibility of non-immune cells to VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 (Fig. 4C).\n",

Unstimulated control cells were also infected with VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 or VSVFLuc-G. The positive effect on VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 entry by PMA stimulation was evident in THP-1 cells. The infectivity of VSVFLuc-G was unchanged by PMA stimulation, but the infectivity of VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 was increased by ~30-fold (Fig. 5). Similar effect was also observed in U937 cells. The infectivity of VSVFLuc-G and VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 were increased by ~10-fold and ~200-fold, respectively (Fig. 5). Therefore, the increase in VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 infection was possibly in part due to the positive effect by PMA for VSV replication. However, further increase in VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 suggested that the VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 entry by RV envelope proteins was promoted by PMA stimulation. These data suggested that immune cells become susceptible to RV infection after stimulation, although the levels are still much lower than those in non-immune cells.\n",

Pseudotype viruses are useful tools for analyzing the susceptibility of specific viruses separately from their intracellular replication processes. A pseudotype virus with RV envelope proteins has been reported previously31. This is a lentiviral pseudotype virus based on the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). However, the SIV vector failed to incorporate the intact forms of RV envelope proteins31. Therefore, the SIV pseudotype virus bearing modified RV envelope proteins with the cytoplasmic tail of the VSV G protein was used in the study31. In the present study, a new pseudotype virus bearing the intact forms of the RV envelope proteins was generated using a VSV pseudotype system. Although the E1 protein alone causes membrane fusion and supports virus entry, the E2 and C proteins play roles in RV entry. After E1 protein binding to a receptor, RV enters cells by endocytosis44. Exposure to the low pH environment in early endosomes induces conformational changes in the E1 and E2 proteins and membrane fusion34, 36 concomitantly with a solubility change in the C protein36. The C protein also has a supportive role in membrane fusion31. The mechanism of fusion enhancement by the C protein is still unclear, but the C protein likely supports the maturation or stabilizes either E2 and E1 or their interactions during intracellular transport to the cell surface31. As expected, co-expression of the C protein promoted the production of infectious VSV pseudotype virus with RV envelope proteins (VSV-RV/CE2E1). Infection by the novel VSV-RV/CE2E1 pseudotype virus was indeed mediated by RV envelope proteins, and the virus underwent a similar entry process to that of the authentic RV as previously reported35, 44.",

Therefore, inefficient infection of immune cell lines with the authentic RV is explainable in part by the poor susceptibility of these cell lines to RV. However, previous studies have demonstrated that immune cells can become infected with RV41\u201343, 45, 46. RV replicates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), of which macrophages are the main target by RV42. Consistent with these observations, RV is isolatable from the PBMCs of patients naturally infected with RV46. Unstimulated lymphocytes poorly support RV infection42, but are able to support RV infection upon stimulation by mitogen41\u201343. Additionally, a previous study showed that Raji and Cess human B-cell lines and the U937 monocyte line all supported RV infection45. Our data do not necessarily contest these previous observations, because a basal level of RV infection was observed in all the immune cell lines, although the efficiency was very low. In addition, our data further demonstrated that the infection of immune cell lines was increased to a certain level by stimulation of the cells. The key point about our data is that the entry efficiency of RV was generally high in non-immune cell lines but not in immune cell lines. These observations are important in terms of understanding more about the pathology of RV.",

These data suggest that the permissibility to RV infection differs considerably among non-immune cell lines. One possible factor modulating the RV infectivity is the host innate immune system. RV is highly sensitive to interferon (IFN)3, 47, 48, and the infectivity of individual cell lines with RV is affected by their capacity for IFN production and response to IFN. Vero cells are defective in IFN production49, 50, and JEG3 and JAR trophoblast cell lines, which support RV infection most efficiently, are refractory to IFN51, 52. Therefore, the activity of innate immunity in individual cells at least partially determines the cell or tissue tropism of RV infection. CRS is a major concern in RV infections. The high infectivity of RV in trophoblast cell lines is an interesting observation that could open a door towards understanding the establishment of RV infection in the fetus after it crosses the placenta. In the fetus, persistent infection of the endothelial cells of the fetal vessels with RV is probably a cause of CRS, because it may induce vascular abnormalities, resulting in dysfunctional or abnormal development of multiple fetal organs or tissue53. Perelygina et al. have shown that human fetal endothelial cells are persistently infected with RV54, 55. Further studies on the cell and tissue tropism of RV and the molecular mechanisms involved in such tropism are essential if we are to understand the pathophysiology of rubella and CRS. The new RV pseudotype system established in the present study will make a positive contribution to these additional studies.",

At 32 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with VSVGFP-G at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3.013, 16, 22, 30, 63. The VSVGFP-G genome lacks the G gene, which is replaced with the GFP gene13. On the viral envelope the VSVGFP-G particles contain the G protein, which is provided in trans using the pC-VSV-G expression plasmid13). The cells were washed four times with DMEM and incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the culture supernatants containing VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 were harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove the cell debris. VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1 was generated similarly to VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 using VSVFLuc-G, which encodes the FLuc gene, instead of the GFP gene14, 28, at a MOI of 0.3. VSVGFP-RV/E2E1 and VSVFLuc-RV/E2E1 were also generated similarly to VSVGFP-RV/CE2E1 and VSVFLuc-RV/CE2E1, respectively, using pcDNA3.1-E2E1 instead of pcDNA3.1-CE2E1. VSVGFP-G, a gift from Dr. M. A. Whitt (University of Tennessee, TN), and VSVFLuc-G were propagated as reported previously13, 14.
