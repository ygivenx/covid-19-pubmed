It is widely distributed and predominant in many countries around the world\n[5]. The Massachusetts strain can infect different organs and some of the isolates could be recovered from gastrointestinal tract especially from the cecal tonsils\n[6,7]. First IBV QX infections characterized by swelling of stomach in chicken flocks were reported in Qingdao China in 1996\n[8]. Following the years the IBV QX viral infections was associated to either proventriculitis or renal infections in IBV vaccinated flocks in China\n[9,10]. The decreases in egg production and false layers in mature hens in chicken flocks were also reported with QX infections\n[10,11]. Later on Chinese QX of IBV was isolated from a backyard flock in Russia where the prevalence of Chinese QX-like genotype was common\n[12,13]. Subsequently there have been increasing reports of QX-like cases in Europe, where the involved virus bearded sequence similarities to QX-like viruses, such as the cases in Belgium, Denmark, France, Hungry, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and UK\n[7,14-19]. These IBV viruses were termed as European QX-like viruses symptoms associated with bad egg quality, false layers in mature hens\n[2].",

            "text": "The spike glycoprotein of the virus is translated as a pre-cursor protein (SO) that is later cleaved into the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 glycopolypeptides. The spike gene is highly variable, especially the S1 part, due to insertions, deletions, substitutions and recombination events\n[14,20,21]. The S1 part of the spike glycoprotein contains serotype specific virus neutralizing epitopes and is responsible for the hemagglutinating activity and for infectivity\n[22]. Due to this variability in nucleotide sequences, the cross protection between serotypes is low. Changes as little as 5% in the S1 sub-unit have been able to alter the protection ability of a vaccine\n[23]. The spike glycoprotein cleavage site motif has been described in bovine coronavirus, turkey coronavirus and human coronavirus, however, it is not found in all coronaviruses\n[24]. The cleavage recognition site in the spike glycoprotein of IBV consists of five basic amino acids, which is cleaved by host cell serine proteases\n[25]. Serine proteases are hydrolases that cleave peptide bonds\n[26,27]. The cleavage recognition site sequence is not involved in pathogenicity because attenuated and pathogenic strains (same virus) possess identical cleavage recognition site sequences\n[26]. The spike glycoprotein of IBV is involved in induction of protective immunity, neutralization and attachment to the host cell\n[28,29]. It contains crucial virus neutralizing epitopes and serotypic specific sequences that are involved in, induction of protective immunity, tissue tropism and attachment into host cells\n[22,25,30-32].",

This could be due to co-habitation of their host species. The appearance of a bat coronavirus branch close to these gammacoronaviruses suggests a possible common origin during earlier evolution of these viruses. The diversity of these viruses could have arisen from strong selective pressure resulting from mutations and recombinations that has been shown to occur in spike gene\n[14,50,51].",

The mammalian beluga whale coronaviruses branched closer to the avian coronaviruses and two avian thrush and munia coronaviruses were related to the mammalian coronaviruses suggesting interspecies transmission. Furthermore, findings of the present study suggest that genetic diversity and molecular variation in sequences of spike glycoprotein of viruses made feasible the adaptation to new host species. Previously it has been reported that the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase gene and the whole genome of the beluga whale coronavirus was distantly related to IBV\n[52,53]. Also a shift of tissue tropism in the virus has been reported\n[54,55] resulting in infection of a wide range of avian host species especially those reared close to domestic fowl. For example, IBV cases were found in guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), Chinese peafowl (Pavo), teal (Anas) and partridge (Alectoris)\n[56].",

The identification of these characteristics will be foundation for the better understanding of epidemics, molecular mechanisms of infections, evolution and basis for development of effective vaccines.
