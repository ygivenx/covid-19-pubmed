This has been largely afforded by the widespread availability of social media (SM) and has been facilitated by the increase in mobile phone ownership. SM has become a valuable tool for communication and it has been utilized in many areas, such as education [1], marketing [2], and health communication [3]. For example, in the field of health communication, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [4] and local health departments in the United States [5] have used Twitter to communicate to people during epidemics. Another example is from the United Kingdom and Norway, where health authorities used Twitter to inform their citizens during the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014 and 2015 [6].",

Thus, various SM platforms and apps can play a vital role in health communication and in the promotion of good health [7]. Despite the advantages that SM potentially offers for health communication, it also faces certain challenges. For example, during a health crisis, there is only a limited amount of time for authorities to respond in an efficient way and inform people, while simultaneously helping to eliminate uncertainty on a topic. If this does not occur promptly, it is much more likely that rumors will spread, possibly through SM; when this happens, the negative effects of SM, such as confusion and misinformation, are the probable results [8].",

In Saudi Arabia, SM rumors prevented some people from going to emergency departments when they were in an acute condition, resulting in the cancellation of their surgical procedures [9]. In Africa, rumors were found on SM that drinking a huge amount of salt water was a cure for Ebola; it has been reported that this may have caused the deaths of several people [10]. Notably, these misinformation issues seem to affect developing countries more deeply; studies have suggested that 4.5% of Twitter posts (ie, tweets) in the United States are misinformed [11], however, Oyeyemi et al [10] found evidence showing that 50% of tweets in West Africa are misinformed.",

In addition, most health-related studies on SM focus on the English-speaking population and the United States [15,16] and not on other cultures. Specifically, Hagg et al [17] reported the absence of literature analyzing SM data for health-related purposes in the Middle East. This is particularly surprising because recent statistics from Statista indicate that Saudi Arabia has the fourth-highest number of Twitter users in the world [18]. Furthermore, when assessing the ratio between Twitter users and populations for each country [19], Saudi Arabia has the highest number of users on Twitter relative to its population. These findings are also supported by other researchers who reported on the elevated prevalence of Twitter usage in Saudi Arabia [20,21]. That being said, only one study\u2014Alnemer et al\u2014has analyzed Saudi health tweets [22].",

It was determined that almost 25% of the analyzed tweets were speculative. Their findings suggested that verified users were more likely to interact with credible hashtags; on average, the number of followers for accounts that posted tweets with credible hashtags was 7000, compared to 2700 for accounts that posted tweets with speculative hashtags in their dataset.

In addition, there are no studies on the general factors that affect the dissemination of trustworthy health-related tweets, besides the credibility of the author and the presence of hashtags and links. We believe that the identification of such factors may help health organizations in better disseminating trustworthy information during an outbreak-related health crisis.

It is important to note that the incorrect selection of indicative health keywords could bias the results [75]. Therefore, two separate methods of analysis were utilized to generate this lexicon. The first method consisted of asking three medical doctors with active Twitter accounts to provide 100 health-related words. The doctors we asked are skilled in different disciplines and differ from each other in their age, background, and gender. They were asked to provide an initial list of health-related words that they think would be used in tweets related to health. The second method involved the usage of 110 health care keywords that were independently identified by an annotator with a college degree in linguistics. As this study concentrates on Saudi Arabia, the annotator identified these keywords by examining a set of tweets with geolocation that indicated a Saudi Arabian origin, although people who enable geolocation are likely to represent a specific demographic group [76,77]. As such, the words chosen by the annotator might have limited generalizability with respect to the wider demographic group. Thus, the annotator also reviewed health-related accounts and hashtags to identify different health-related words. A complete list of keywords is attached in Multimedia Appendix 1.",
