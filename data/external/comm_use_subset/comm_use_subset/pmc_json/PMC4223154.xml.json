            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that circulates in a bird-mosquito enzootic cycle with humans and horses as incidental hosts [1]. It belongs to the Japanese encephalitis subgroup that also includes Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), St Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus [1]. The genome of WNV consists of a single-stranded, positive sense mRNA-like RNA molecule of \u223c11,000 nucleotides which serves as template for a complementary negative sense RNA. Translation of the positive sense viral RNA produces a single polyprotein that is cleaved during and after translation into 3 structural proteins (C, prM/M, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [1]. The structural proteins are part of immature and mature virions while the C protein is the sole protein component of the nucleocapsid [1], [2]. Non-structural proteins perform many vital functions of the virus lifecycle including replication (NS1, NS2A) [3]\u2013[7], protein processing (NS3, NS2B) [8]\u2013[10] and virus assembly [11], [12]. Additionally, NS proteins are shown to be involved in modulation of the host cell antiviral responses including inhibition of interferon a/b (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) induction (NS2A) [13], IFN\u03b1/\u03b2/signalling [14]\u2013[18], TLR-3 signal transduction (NS1) [19], and complement activation (NS1) [20].",

The NS1\u2032 was detected 25 years ago in JEV infected cells [21] but the mechanism of its synthesis was only recently discovered. Firstly, the occurrence of programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) in the 5\u2032 terminus of the NS2A gene was established by computational modelling of viral RNA structures by Firth and Atkins [22]. Later, the NS1\u2032 protein synthesis, its amino acid sequence, and RNA sequence requirements for PRF were experimentally demonstrated in mosquito cells, mammalian cells, and cell-free settings [22], [23]. PRF occurred in \u223c50% of translational events and led to the production of NS1\u2032 protein containing the entire NS1 sequence, the first 9 aa of NS2A protein, and 43 aa unique to NS1\u2032 (Figure 1A). Translation of NS1\u2032 protein culminated with a stop codon which impeded any further translation in the \u22121 open reading frame (Figure 1A).",

            "text": "Although the specific function(s) of NS1\u2032 have not been determined several studies had investigated potential roles for NS1\u2032 protein [23]\u2013[27]. We reported that WNVKUN mutants (e.g. A30A\u2032) carrying silent mutations abolishing PRF (and NS1\u2032) without affecting viral accumulation showed attenuated virulence in a mouse model of encephalitis [23]. Interestingly, the JEV strain SA14-14-2 recommended for use as live attenuated vaccine by the World Health Organization contains the single mutation G66A in the NS2A gene which ablated production of NS1\u2032 and reduced neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness in mice [28]. G66A and G67A mutants in NS2A of another strain of JEV, JaOArS982c, abolishing NS1\u2032 production, have also shown reduced replication in avian DF-1 cells and in embryonated chicken eggs [25]. Interestingly, NS1\u2032 protein produced by the wt JaOArS982 virus was shown to co-localize with NS5 protein [25], indicating a role for NS1\u2032 in RNA replication. Furthermore, Winkelmann et al. demonstrated that mutations eliminating PRF/NS1\u2032 enhanced trans-encapsidation of WNV replicons suggesting a role for NS1\u2032 in virion assembly [26]. Our group previously demonstrated that NS1\u2032 co-localized with NS1 and dsRNA and rescued replication in trans of a replication-deficient WNVKUN genome containing large deletion in NS1 gene [27]. More recently studies in other laboratories also showed successful complementation of NS1-deleted WNV genome by the WNV NS1\u2032 protein expressed from an alphavirus replicon vector [29]. These data from different laboratories strongly suggest that NS1\u2032, like NS1, may be one of the components of viral RNA replication complex and therefore plays a role in viral RNA replication.",

Since the viral polyprotein is translated as a single molecule (Figure 1A top panel) in the absence of PRF all proteins should be produced in equimolar amounts. It is logical to assume that in the presence of PRF (during WT infection) proteins located upstream of the PRF will be produced in excess to those proteins located downstream of the PRF site (Figure 1A). Since expression of all NS proteins (with the exception of NS1\u2032) is affected by PRF, the viral polyprotein expression event when PRF occurs is essentially separated into structural and non-structural proteins (Figure 1). Conversely, if our hypothesis is correct, in infections with PRF-deficient mutants, such as A30A\u2032 and A30P mutant viruses, all viral proteins would be produced in equimolar amounts and the ratios of structural to non-structural proteins would differ from those observed during WT/PRF-competent infections.",

We inoculated groups of ten HOSPs with 1500 PFU of WT WNVNY99 and A30A\u2032 mutant WNVNY99 viruses and collected serum daily for 7 days after infection to analyze virus titers by plaque assay on BHK cells. WT WNVNY99 virus reached peak average titers of 4.4 log10 PFU at day 3, while A30A\u2032 mutant WNVNY99 virus reached an average titer of 3.7 log10 PFU at day 2 after infection (Figure 6). WT WNVNY99 titers remained higher than A30A\u2032 WNVNY99 virus titers until day 4 after infection and both viruses were then essentially cleared by 7 dpi (Figure 6). It should be noted that significant variations in susceptibility to WNV infection are common between individual wild-caught HOSPs [40]. Although the differences in virus titres between WT and A30A\u2032 WNVNY99 infections did not reach statistical significance by two way ANOVA comparison, the A30A\u2032 WNVNY99 virus nevertheless showed noticeable attenuation at the peak time of infection (Figure 6), suggesting a role for PRF/NS1\u2032 in WNVNY99 virulence in avian hosts.",

The ability for the virus to infect and disseminate from the midgut was assessed in both experiments, while the ability for mosquitoes to transmit the viruses was also assessed in experiment 2. In both experiments, the body infection rates were higher in the mosquitoes exposed to WT WNVKUN viruses than either of the mutant WNVKUN viruses, with the difference being significant (P<0.001) in experiment 2 (Figure 7A). Similarly, the virus disseminated at lower rates in the mosquitoes exposed to the A30A\u2032 and A30P viruses than the WT virus, with the difference not being significant (P = 0.3915) for A30A\u2032 in experiment 1 only. Infection and dissemination rates were lower in mosquitoes exposed to A30P than those exposed to A30A\u2032, although the difference was not significant. Finally, both the A30A\u2032 and A30P viruses were transmitted at significantly lower rates (P<0.005) than the WT virus. The lack of PRF/NS1\u2032 affected the ability for the virus to replicate in the mosquito body and the quantity of virus expectorated, with the titers in the bodies and saliva expectorates being significantly lower (P<0.0001) in mosquitoes infected with A30A\u2032 and A30P, than those in the WT viruses (Figure 7B).",

Despite the high rates of infection for the 3 viruses, the titers of virus within the bodies were significantly lower in the mutant viruses than the WT virus (Figure 7C).

This is in contradiction to the findings of Winkelmann et al. who found that abolishment of PRF and NS1\u2032 production impacted the ability of the mutated replicon to be encapsidated into virus-like particles [26]. However, it is possible that the effect observed in those experiments was due to the use of a heterologous trans-encapsidation model where WNV replicon RNAs were packaged by dengue virus structural proteins since when WNV structural proteins were used for packaging WNV replicons, the difference in packaging efficiency between PRF-competent and PRF-deficient replicon RNAs was greatly reduced [26].",

Changes in the global gene expression induced by infections with WT or A30A\u2032 viruses were similar with only a small number of genes differentially expressed and also with relatively small differences in their levels of expression. These differentially expressed genes included transcription factors, protease inhibitors, and ER stress response elements.

These differentially expressed genes in response to A30P infection include transcription factors, anti-apoptotic signals, and thermo-tolerance factors.

On the other hand, the A30A\u2032 swarm did not contain mutations to revert to WT sequence at position 3615 (proportion column, 0.999 = 0.1%) indicating that A30A\u2032 had lost the need and/or ability to revert to WT through \u201cerror-prone\u201d replication events. The significance of the 3615 position, and the PRF events, was underscored by our observations in position 3618. In our initial study [23], we introduced the extra G to A change at position 3618 of the A30A\u2032 mutant with the purpose of minimizing a chance of reverse mutation(s) back to the WT sequences; this position per se does not play a role in pseudoknot formation and PRF. In contrast to the \u223c11% of WT population reads containing a mutation at position 3615 less than 1% of reads showed mutations at position 3618. This suggest the intriguing possibility that during WT infection a significant proportion of the genomes produced (\u223c11%) are PRF-deficient, a de-facto compensation for at least a proportion of the \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting events occurring during WT infection [23]. Further studies will be required to elucidate the true meaning of the existence of this virus sub-population, however it is likely that regulation of PRF frequency is employed by the virus to maintain the right balance between higher and lower replication efficiencies as the result of more or less efficient PRF event.",

We hypothesize that such \u201cexcess\u201d of structural proteins may lead to an increase in prM-E particles and/or act as an elegant modulator of viral protein expression, which may indirectly regulate host responses to viral infections. Pseudoknot formation and \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting in coding regions of viral genomes have been described previously [41], [42]. In retroviruses, precise ratios of frameshifting allows expression of the viral Gag-Pol polyprotein and sets an optimal Gag\u2236Gag-Pol ratio for virion assembly and packaging of reverse transcriptase [43]. Similarly, in SARS-CoV pp1a and pp1ab, which are expressed by frameshifting, are predicted to form a heterodimer with a stoichiometry of 8/1 as part of the replication machinery [44], [45]. In both examples maintaining precise ratios of frameshifting is crucial for virus accumulation and we would argue that similar mechanisms might be required during infection of mosquitoes and birds with WT and PRF-deficient WNVs. Indeed, we demonstrated that PRF affects virus infectivity and/or spread in mosquito vectors and in the generation of elevated viremias in an avian host species, HOSPs. PRF-deficient mutant (A30A\u2032) showed lower titers in birds and mosquitoes and also reduced ability to be transmitted by mosquitoes as shown by lower percentage of infected saliva for these mutants. A role in replication of PRF/NS1\u2032 in birds and mosquitoes would explain the phenotypes observed despite this and other reports where differences in replication in several cells lines infected with PRF-deficient mutants [23], [30] were not observed. The difference between in vitro and in vivo results is often seen for the bird phenotype [39]. Interestingly, in contrast to our results in avian DF-1 cells, JEV PRF mutant virus replicated significantly less efficiently than wild type JEV virus in DF-1 cells [25], suggesting that difference exists also between different albeit closely related flaviviruses in their ability to replicate in the absence of PRF in vitro.",

Our data suggest the existence of interactions between NS1\u2032 protein (or an effect of PRF) and host response pathway(s)/factors that are efficient (present) in whole mosquitoes but not in cellular models of infection, including mosquito cell lines, some of which are known to be deficient in a host factor, e.g. C6/36 cells are deficient in dicer 2 [51]. In this context, the role of insect gut barriers and its interaction with the flavivirus genome is critical. Increased viral accumulation in the gut has been reported to correlate with the ability of the arboviral infection to spread throughout the mosquito and determine its capacity to transmit infection by bite [52]. Efficient infection of the midgut is likely to trigger a robust innate response by the host including, but not limited to, stimulation of enzymes involved in the oxidative stress response and re-epithelialization of damaged cells of the midgut wall [53], [54]. It is intriguing that the PRF motif is highly conserved among the JEV serocomplex viruses that utilize both Culex mosquito vector and avians as their primary vertebrate replication hosts while other flaviviruses that utilize primate and Aedes vectors such as Dengue virus 1\u20134 and Yellow fever viruses or rodents and ticks have not demonstrated to encode PRF. The results presented herein show the role of PRF as mechanism for modulation of the stoichiometric ratio of structural to non-structural genetic determinants that could be involved in modulating mosquito RNAi responses or potentially avian innate immune responses.",
