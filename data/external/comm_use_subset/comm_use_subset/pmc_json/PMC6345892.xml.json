            "text": "Bats are reservoir hosts of a large number of zoonotic viral infections, including some of the recently emerged severe infectious diseases affecting humans1\u20134. They are implicated as reservoirs and vectors for transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, lyssaviruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses1,2,4. Recently a novel lineage of influenza A virus was discovered in bats in Central America5. A comprehensive analysis of known mammal-virus associations determined that bats harbor a significantly larger proportion of zoonoses compared to all other mammalian orders6. Pathogen spillovers from bats to domestic animals and humans may thus represent a serious threat to public health, biodiversity and global security7. For this reason, considerable scientific and public health interest is invested into identifying the mechanisms and conditions for cross-species transmission leading to a potential pandemic episode8,9. A key step to reach this goal and reduce the risk for humans from pathogens of bat-origin requires the understanding of how bat ecology may influence the infectious disease dynamics, and thus elucidating those aspects that are most critical to the circulation of viruses in bats.",

Here we focus on lyssaviruses (Rhabdoviridae family, Lyssavirus genus), the agents of rabies diseases. Bats are considered to be the ancestral hosts of lyssaviruses, before the viruses progressively diverged from this common ancestor to many recipient host species11\u201313. To date, bats were found to serve as reservoirs of 15 of the 17 lyssavirus species currently known14,15. In Europe, four different lyssavirus species have been isolated in bats, namely European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2, respectively), Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV), West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) and one tentative species, Lleida bat lyssavirus13,16\u201319. Reported in Europe for the first time in 195420, EBLV-1 is the most commonly found species in the continent with a wide distribution across Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Spain16,20\u201324. It has the potential to cross the species barrier and infect other domestic and wild mammals20,22,25,26, as well as humans19,24,27, where it causes fatal encephalitis, indistinguishable from other lyssaviruses.",

Colony size and species richness were found to be associated with an increased EBLV-1 seroprevalence in Spanish bats33,35. Population density and proximity of bats in the same cave provide indeed higher chances for mixing and transmission between individuals. A large number of species in the same roost might not only increase the rates of contact between bat populations, but also provide paths for cross-species diffusion and subsequent seeding events in other caves thanks to individual mobility. This suggests that infection cycles may be maintained among different host species, facilitating transient epidemics through extinction and recolonization events in a spatially structured environment, and overall potentially contributing to the spatial circulation of the virus at the regional scale.",

Findings from passive and active surveillance suggest that bats may be capable of being exposed to lyssaviruses without dying29. No evidence has however addressed so far this aspect in a satisfactory or definitive way, mainly because of the scarce available knowledge on bat immunology40. Experimental infections in the primary host of EBLV-1 highlighted a strong dependence of the efficiency of transmission and probability of causing rabies disease on the virus transmission route41. The absence of virus-neutralizing activity in all sera under all transmission conditions is however in sharp contrast with field data from Spain, France, and Germany25,30,33,35,42. The presence of EBLV-1 neutralizing antibody response in healthy individuals appears to be relatively common and have been documented in E. serotinus and in other bat species including M. myotis and M. schreibersii in various regions30,33,35,42,43. While its interpretation remains rather difficult, previous work suggested this response may result from bats recovering from the infection following EBLV exposure30. Direct evidence of transmission during abortive or subclinical infection under natural conditions is indeed difficult to achieve with active surveillance as lyssaviruses are excreted only for short periods25,30. A recent longitudinal survey of E. serotinus colonies in France42 found for the first time viral RNA in bats saliva concomitant with virus excretion, and later followed by seropositivity, suggesting that transmission may occur during subclinical infection. In addition, individual waves of seroconversion and waning of immunity were reported in the same colony, similar to previous results obtained for M. myotis in Spain44.",

Such cross-disciplinary integrative modeling was previously suggested as a relevant research avenue to provide additional insights into the infectious disease dynamics with implications for our understanding of zoonotic disease emergence and associated risk for humans2. Here we develop a data-driven mechanistic metapopulation model for EBLV-1 spatial diffusion in the Miniopterus schreibersii and Myotis myotis non-synanthropic bat species in a system of caves in Catalonia, a region in the North-East of Spain. The model builds on existing data from a long-term field survey of EBLV-1 infection in natural bat colonies in the region33,35,38. M. myotis live as a single colony of few hundred individuals in the cave called Can Palomeres. M. schreibersii is a regional migratory species following a complex annual migration from cave to cave in the region. The two species share the same habitat in Can Palomeres during summer months. Through the use of spatially-resolved demographic and migration data, we explore several hypotheses regarding unknown epidemiological (transmission potential), immunological (lethal infection, immunity) and ecological aspects (cross-species mixing, seasonality in mixing, migratory behavior) to identify the mechanisms responsible for the reported EBLV-1 persistence in the two species. Given the current limitations of global surveillance for zoonotic diseases, focusing on the dynamics of bat infectious diseases and improving our understanding of the mechanisms driving their persistence may provide useful information to complement the available scarce resources to predict epizootics and potential risk for humans.",

Even a low probability of developing lethal infection together with bats migration and reseeding through cross-species mixing would not be able to sustain the epidemic, regardless of the loss of immunity. While Lyssavirus infections are known to be generally lethal for mammals and for some bat species52,53, current knowledge from experimental and natural studies is not sufficient to accurately and satisfactorily define EBLV-1 disease progression in bats in natural conditions30,33,35,40,42,43. This is further complicated by biological and regulatory aspects. First, despite recent evidence for E. serotinus bats in France42, detecting a subclinical infective state in healthy bats in natural colonies is rather unlikely because of the short duration of the excretion period, and no such evidence exists yet for M. schreibersii or M. myotis. Second, the legal framework protecting European bats54 makes field studies particularly difficult to implement, as for instance marking bats is forbidden in Europe and special authorizations need to be requested to conduct these studies. Little but precious available field data are providing however an increasing body of evidence pointing to the possibility that various bat species may experience an infective subclinical state after being exposed to EBLV-1, followed by recovery and loss of immunity, with no associated increased mortality25,30,35,42,44, in agreement with our model results. A constant survival rate despite recurrent EBLV-1 epidemic cycles was reported for M. myotis44, supporting the findings of our model. Additional field data is needed to confirm our numerical predictions on EBLV-1 infection in M. schreibersii.",

The importance of cross-species transmission of lyssaviruses was also reported in other ecological settings, identifying phylogenetic distance as the key determinant for cross-species transmission of rabies virus in North American bat species11,56. No study of this kind has been performed yet on EBLV-1 hosts species, and while the mixing intensity between M. schreibersii and M. myotis in Can Palomeres is unknown, our persistence estimates remain quite robust against this assumption.

We find that transmission among M. schreibersii bats in Can Palomeres (i.e. under the highest mixing conditions) is similar to what was previously estimated for M. myotis (R0 = 1.7) in natural colonies in Spain44. These conditions of transmissibility are associated to other caves being in close-to-critical or sub-critical conditions for efficient epidemic transmission. Persistence is thus mainly supported by transmission in Can Palomeres, though this cave only is not sufficient to maintain endemicity in M. myotis. The modeling predictions for the M. schreibersii immunity period are in the ballpark of previous empirical estimates of the maximum length of seropositive status observed in M. myotis (2\u20133 years)35 and in E. serotinus (4 years)42. Individuals are predicted to be immune on average for more than a year, thus hindering virus survival because of the slow replenishment of susceptible hosts. This effect is however counterbalanced by the migration of hosts that occurs on an annual timescale, providing opportunities for seeding events in na\u00efve populations, a mechanism already identified by theoretical works to sustain viral circulation62. A rather large confidence interval is obtained for the estimate of the immunity period, indicating that the available serological data are not sufficient to significantly discriminate between approximately 1 year and 2 years of duration of immunity. Also, the likelihood of persistence is predicted to vary quite considerably within this range, as the system is found in the transition between null or negligible persistence and very high probability of viral maintenance. Additional cross-sectional studies in this colony and at higher temporal resolution may help improve our estimates.",

For instance, through a comparative approach across bat species and lyssavirus types, it may become possible to isolate host-pathogen specific drivers (e.g. the difference in pathogenicity between bats hosting rabies virus59 and EBLV-1) from commonalities (such as spatial structure and introductions) that would represent the key mechanisms for disease persistence across a range of lyssavirus systems. Understanding those, as well as the impact of possible anthropogenic changes on the infection dynamics in bats (e.g. a cave refuge for bats transformed into a touristic park), is essential for assessing bats capacity to serve as lyssavirus reservoirs in different geographic areas of the world and predicting the associated pathways for spillover events9.",

Given the large geographic distribution of M. schreibersii, and the critical role of its migratory behavior for pathogen persistence examined here, the discovery of a novel and potentially deadly filovirus in Western Europe is a significant concern.

            "text": "With human-wildlife interactions still difficult to quantify9, considerable attention has shifted to animal populations. Spurred by outbreaks of high-impact viral zoonoses causing severe disease in human population, this paradigmatic shift has led to a remarkable increase in wildlife disease surveillance for early recognition of potential threats to humans (e.g. avian influenza in wild birds66, coronaviruses in bats67\u201369, etc.). Even after controlling for confounding factors such as investment in surveillance and research, bats were identified as carrying the highest proportion of zoonotic viruses across all mammals6. Moreover, hotspots of missing zoonoses were predicted for bats in Latin America and some parts of Asia, suggesting that pathogen diversity in bat species may be even larger than what currently known. Within such diversity, lyssaviruses still represent the only group of pathogens naturally circulating in bats for which a direct causal link between an infected bat and humans is well recorded19,24,27,70\u201383. Though the largest majority of rabid cases in humans is transmitted by rabid dogs, humans can develop rabies diseases after contact with a bat infected with a lyssavirus, leading to invariably fatal cases. Moreover, accurate human morbidity estimates for infections transmitted by bats are generally hard to achieve because standard diagnostic tests cannot readily resolve the causative lyssavirus14. Rabies vaccination is generally recommended in specific contexts to prevent and mitigate occupational hazards, often leading to a heavy financial burden on public health infrastructure84.",

We did not consider E. serotinus bats in our model, the host species associated with the large majority of EBLV-1 cases detected in Europe19,20,28. While present in the region under study, its synanthropic behavior (i.e. living close to humans populations) likely precluded interactions with M. schreibersii and M. myotis, which instead clearly exhibit a non-synanthropic behaviour, roosting in natural caves and in abandoned mines35. Moreover, our model considers the two host populations to be closed and isolated in the region under study. While contacts with other non-synanthropic bat species of smaller population sizes may occur in Can Palomeres, our findings show that 2 host species are enough to self-sustain the epidemic given cross-species mixing and 1-species migration, with no need for additional introductions from other sites. This may appear to be in contrast with was found in other contexts, e.g. in a rabies virus model in vampire bats where persistence was largely dependent on immigration of infected individuals51. Our model however already accounts for seeding events from one patch to another thanks to the migration of M. schreibersii. Similarly to the study by Blackwood et al., we find indeed that the virus would not be maintained in a single population only.",

An important fraction of the population (estimated 60%) continues the migration further north to other refuges composed of breeding or summer colonies (\u201cSummer refuges\u201d, SR, in Fig. 1a), where they stay approximately all summer. During the same period, the remaining bats stay in Can Palomeres where they share the refuge with M. myotis. Once summer is over, the entire M. schreibersii colony returns to Avenc Dav\u00ec following the northern route in the opposite direction: from Summer refuges to Can Palomeres, to Castanya, to Avenc Dav\u00ed for hibernation to conclude the annual migration. Bats following the southern route from Avenc Dav\u00ed reach a set of caves near the coast (\u201cOther caves\u201d, OC) and return to Avenc Dav\u00ed for hibernation, reuniting with the bats following the northern route.
