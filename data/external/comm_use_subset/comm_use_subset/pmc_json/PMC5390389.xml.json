Persistent existence of HBV replication is an independent risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1, 2]. Antiviral therapy based on current options, recombinant interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and nucleotide/nucleoside analogs, has markedly reduced the incidence of liver cirrhosis and HCC [3, 4]. However, it hardly eliminates HBV infection and the suppression of viral replication below the limit of detection does not completely prevent HCC development although liver fibrosis can be stopped [4, 5]. For examples, during nucleoside analog lamivudine treatment, the cumulative HCC rate at 5 years is 3% in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and up to 30% in those with liver cirrhosis, and even for the more effective and lower resistant entecavir (ETV), five year-treatment only reduces HCC risk from 13.7 to 3.7% in patients with CHB or advanced liver fibrosis [6, 7]. As for the cumulative HCC rates at 10 years, the situation is even worse. No matter ETV or lamivudine is used, such rates are up to 29.6 and 53.4% in patients with CHB and liver cirrhosis, respectively [8]. Thus, it remains imperative to search for new therapeutic targets against HBV infection or HCC development.",

            "text": "HBV is a hepatotropic enveloped virus with 3.2-kb partially double-stranded circular viral genome. The viral genome is packaged inside the capsid that is assembled by viral core protein (hepatitis B core antigen, HBcAg) to generate nucleocapsid in cytosol. The viral envelope mainly consists of small-surface protein (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg). Some small surface protein has additional extensions of pre-S2 (middle surface protein) or pre-S1 and pre-S2 (large surface protein) in N-terminus. These proteins are cotranslationally integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. While penetrates into the ER lumen, the viral nucleocapsid is packaged with these trans-membrane proteins to generate mature virions [9]. During the life cycle, HBV also synthesized a secretory core protein that finally matures into hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). During synthesis, the nascent peptide chain is directed to the ER by a signal sequence, and develops into HBeAg precursor after the signal sequence is removed. HBeAg precursor is further digested by furin in the Golgi apparatus to generate mature HBeAg [10, 11]. HBeAg precursor detained in the ER or undigested by furin is retro-transported to cytosol or expresses on the surface of hepatocytes [12, 13]. HBeAg released into bloodstream serves as an immunotolerance inducer [14\u201316]. In contrast, HBeAg precursor on the cell surface has chance to initiate antiviral immunity and in cytosol can inhibit HBV replication via formation of capsidation-incompetent capsids with HBcAg [17\u201319].",

            "text": "Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78/BiP) constitutively expresses in the ER. It is involved in the major functions of the ER by translocating newly synthesized polypeptides across the ER membrane, facilitating the folding and secretion of proteins, targeting misfolded or unnecessary proteins for ER-associated protein degradation, and serving as the ER stress sensor to release cells from the stress conditions [20, 21]. With regard to HBV infection, GRP78 is at least involved in four important processes, viral replication, viral secretion, HBeAg secretion and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinogenesis. GRP78 has been reported to inhibit HBV replication by facilitating HBV transcript degradation via activation of IFN-\u03b21-2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L pathway [22], to promote virion secretion via guiding posttranslational ER translocation of the HBV large envelope protein [23, 24], to enhance the retro-transportation of HBeAg precursor from the ER into cytosol [12], which may affect HBeAg secretion, and to facilitate the migration and invasion of HCC via reduction of ER stress-induced apoptosis, expression on cell-surface or conferring drug resistance [25\u201328]. The effect of HBV replication inhibition suggest that GRP78 up-regulation is of therapeutic potential for chronic HBV infection, but the rest effects on promoting virion secretion and HCC invasion argue against the above potential. Those contradictory effects let us not know the overall effect of GRP78 on HBV production and how to make a choice to utilize the anti-HBV effect of up-regulation or the cancer-preventing effect of down-regulation of GRP78 in the future.",

Though both reports used siRNA to down-regulate GRP78, the decrease and increase in supernatant HBV particles were observed, respectively. This discordance may result from the difference in cell models. Compared with HepAD38 cells, HepG2.2.15 cells produce HBV particles in a continuous manner, which better mimics the persistent infection state of patients. For this reason, HepG2.2.15 cells were used in this study to clarify the overall effect of GRP78 on HBV production. GRP78 was successfully up-regulated and down-regulated by transfections of the recombinant expression plasmid and the siRNA of GRP78, respectively (Fig. 1a). GRP78 overexpression reduced supernatant and intracellular core-associated HBV DNA and GRP78 knockdown showed the opposite effect (Fig. 1b and c). GRP78 was regularly detected as two bands, perhaps due to splice variation. Though the same cell model was used, the effect of GRP78 here was opposite to that reported in the published literature [24], which may result from the uses of different observation time, 72 h in this study and 24 h in literature. To test this possibility, supernatant core-associated HBV DNA was detected 24 h after transfections (Fig. 1d). As result, GRP78 indeed moderately increases the supernatant level of HBV particles. Furthermore, GRP78 was found to inhibit HBV production slightly 48 h and significantly 96 h after transfections. The above results suggest that the HBV replication-inhibiting effect of GRP78 time-dependently overwhelmed its viral secretion-promoting effect and that GRP78 mainly inhibits HBV production in patients with persistent infection.\n",

Based on the findings in HepG2 cells (parent cells of HepG2.2.15), GRP78 has been reported to inhibit HBV replication through the activation of the IFN-\u03b21-2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L pathway [22]. Here, we wonder whether GRP78 similarly inhibits HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. Unexpectedly, GRP78 overexpression or knockdown did not significantly affect the mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b21 and RNase L genes (Fig. 2a) or the protein level of IFN-\u03b21 (Fig. 2b) in HepG2.2.15 cells. To clarify the reasons behind the deviation in HepG2.2.15 cells, we further compared the expression levels of those genes of interest between these two cell lines. As results, the mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b21and RNase L genes in HepG2.2.15 cells were only about 1/10 and 1/100 of those in HepG2 cells, respectively (Fig. 2c). Similarly, the protein level of IFN-\u03b21 in HepG2.2.15 cells was much lower than that in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2d). These results ascertain that the IFN-\u03b21-dependent pathway has been blocked and GRP78 does not inhibit HBV replication by this pathway in HepG2.2.15 cells.\n",

In addition, the enhanced retro-transportation of HBeAg precursor may reduces HBeAg synthesis, which is meaningful for HBeAg seroconversion in clinical practice. Indeed, GRP78 overexpression resulted in the increase in cytosolic HBeAg precursor and the decreases in HBeAg secretion (Fig. 3a and b). In contrast, GRP78 knockdown showed the opposite effects.

As results, GRP78 overexpression was found to promote wound healing 48 h after transfection (Fig. 4a and b).

Based on its characteristics to inhibit HBV secretion and cancer invasion, GRP78 down-regulation may be a promising supplement for current antiviral options. However, GRP78 down-regulation significantly increased HBV replication and HBeAg secretion (Figs. 1 and 3). Our previous study has shown that ETV, a broadly accepted antiviral drug in clinical practice, combined with D6R, a furin inhibitor that moderately inhibits HBeAg secretion but is unlike the other common furin inhibitor to enhance HBV replication [13], inhibits HBV replication and HBeAg secretion simultaneously [30]. For these reasons, we here examined whether ETV and D6R coped with those unpleasant effects. Fortunately, ETV completely abolished the HBV replication-enhancing effect of GRP78 knockdown though its own effect was moderately reduced (Fig. 5a and b). Similarly, D6R completely abolished the HBeAg secretion-enhancing effect (Fig. 5c).\n",

It also suggests that GRP78 knockdown may be favorable for HCC prevention. However, GRP78 knockdown was found to increase HBV replication and HBeAg secretion.

It is well-documented that cytosolic HBeAg precursor can inhibit HBV replication by formation of HBV encapsidation-incompetent capsids [18, 19].

Perhaps due to the persistent existence of HBV, HepG2.2.15 cells was unlike other hepatoma cell line in which HBV is inhibited through the IFN-\u03b21-dependent pathway. However, based on wound healing tests, the effect of GRP78 on the mobility of HepG2.2.15 cells was similar to that of HBV-free cell lines. In addition, GRP78 usually highly expresses in HCC tissues, and the expression level is positively correlates with portal and intra-hepatic invasions [33, 34]. The HCC-contributing mechanisms of GRP78 include alleviating the ER stress, mediating by loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN and enhancing the activation and activity of FAK [35\u201337]. Thus, it is ascertained that GRP78 is substantially involved in HCC tumorigenesis. Because HCC is a fatal complication of chronic HBV infection, the possibility of GRP78 up-regulation as an anti-HBV strategy seems to be dismissed unless GRP78 up-regulation can lead to the rapid elimination of chronic HBV infection in early stage. Unfortunately, it is well known that the elimination of chronic HBV infection is an ambitious expectation currently.",

The on-treatment cumulative HCC rate at 10 years is about 30% in patients with CHB and up to 50% in those with cirrhosis. In view of the effects of GRP78 on HCC, GRP78 down-regulation may be a potentially supplementary measure to improve the HCC prevention efficacy of current antiviral therapy. Indeed, GRP78 knockdown may decrease the invasion capability, reduce the risk of resistance to sorafenib and enhance the adenosine-induced apoptosis [27, 38, 39]. However, some articles report the opposite effect. GRP78 down-regulation enhances migration ability in some cell lines of HCC, perhaps due to their unique pattern of GRP78 expression [40, 41]. In addition, GRP78 down-regulation enhanced HBV replication and HBeAg secretion though these unpleased effects were abrogated by ETV and furin inhibitor, respectively. Therefore, GRP78 as a therapeutic target is of potential, but has substantial limitations, which urges for more intensive studies in the future.",

HepG2.2.15 cells were regularly cultivated, transfected with siRNA targeted GRP78 (siGRP78) or its control (siControl) and treated with or without ETV (20 nmol/L) or furin inhibitor II (D6R, 100 \u03bcmol/L). a ETV abolished the enhancing effect of GRP78 down-regulation on supernatant core-associated HBV DNA. Results are expressed as n-fold times the supernatant HBV DNA level of test groups over those of controls. * P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. b. ETV abolished the enhancing effect of GRP78 down-regulation on intracellular core-associated HBV DNA. Relaxed circular (RC) HBV DNA was the HBV genome, and single stranded (SS) HBV DNA, other bands and the smear were the replication intermediates (RI) of HBV. c Furin inhibitor abolished the enhancing effect of GRP78 down-regulation on HBeAg secretion. Results are expressed as n-fold times the supernatant HBeAg level of test groups over those of controls. * P < 0.05",
