Since December 2010, massive outbreaks of PED have occurred in China, with 80\u2013100% morbidity and 50\u201390% mortality in suckling piglets (2, 3). The recent research provides evidence for airborne transmission of PED virus (PEDV) (4), which has greater transmission potential than other seasonal diarrhea viruses (5, 6). The small intestine, especially the jejunum and ileum, is the target tissue of PEDV infection (7). The M Protein and the N protein, being the most abundant envelope component and a structural basis for the helical nucleocapsid of PEDV, respectively, are commonly used in the clinical diagnosis of PED (8\u201310). To date, no feed additive is available to effectively inhibit the replication of PEDV.",

Puerarin (PR) is an isoflavonoid isolated from Gegen, which is a traditional Chinese herb medicine (12). PR has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (13\u201315) and has been proven to be an effective antimicrobial agent (16). PR significantly prevented human alveolar epithelial A549 cells from Staphylococcus aureus-induced injury and may be considered as a potential candidate for the development of anti-virulence drugs in the treatment of S. aureus-mediated infections (17). A recent study found that pre-treatment with PR protected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cells) from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection through inhibiting bacterial adhesion and inflammatory responses (18). Another study found that PR had a moderate ability to reduce hepatitis B virus production in vitro (19). Additionally, Kudzu root-extracted PR inhibited HIV-1 replication by blocking the initial attachment of the viral particle to the cell surface in primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages (20). Lin et al. found that the water extract of Pueraria lobata Ohwi has anti-viral activity against human respiratory syncytial virus in human respiratory tract cell lines (21). Therefore, these results suggest that PR could be a promising supplement for antiviral therapy. However, little is known about its effectiveness against PEDV infection.",

Bioinformatics analysis has been applied to explore the mechanisms of interaction among the host, pathogen, and drug. In recent years, the quantitative proteomic analysis has been used to investigate the pathogenic mechanism of PEDV infection (24, 25). However, most of these studies are performed in vitro with a label-based quantitative proteomic (LQP) approach. Previous studies have indicated that the label-free approach by far outperforms the LQP method for the proteome coverage, as up to threefold more proteins are reproducibly identified in replicate measurements (26). It is of great importance to study the interaction between PEDV and the host in vivo, which could provide more biologically relevant insights into the pathogenesis of PEDV.",

Twenty-four 7-day-old crossbred (Duroc \u00d7 Landrace \u00d7 Large White) healthy piglets (half male and half female), initially weighing 3.17 \u00b1 0.25 kg, were purchased from a PEDV-negative farm. They were randomly allocated into one of three treatment groups (Control, PEDV, PEDV + PR; eight replicates per group). The experimental basal diet (a liquid milk replacer), which was formulated to meet the requirements of all nutrients for suckling piglets, was purchased from Wuhan Anyou Feed Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). Piglets were housed in clean pens with strict control of cross-infection. The entire trial period was 12 days. During day 5 to 9 of the trial, the piglets in the PEDV + PR group were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight; dissolved in the liquid milk replacer), and the piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of the liquid milk replacer. On day 9 of the trial, PEDV at a dose of 104.5 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig was orally inoculated to pigs in the PEDV and the PEDV + PR groups, while the Control group was mock inoculated in parallel with the same volume of sterile saline. Pigs were observed daily to record the health status and diarrhea incidence. On day 12, all piglets were weighed and sacrificed to obtain the jejunum, ileum, colonic chyme, and mesenteric lymph nodes. All samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at\u221280\u00b0C until analysis. The protocols of PEDV infection and sample collection were described previously (27).

The soluble protein was collected after the removal of tissue debris by centrifugation (12,000 \u00d7 g, 20 min, 4\u00b0C). The protein concentration was quantified by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (25). Approximately 200 \u03bcg of proteins from each sample was subjected to filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) trypsin digestion to generate peptides. Briefly, protein samples were diluted to 100 \u03bcl with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and disulfide bonds in protein were reduced by treating the sample with 2 \u03bcl of 500 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 150 min at 37\u00b0C (the final concentration of DDT was 10 mM), and then alkylated with 14 \u03bcl of 500 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature (25\u00b0C) for 40 min in the dark (the final concentration of IAA was 60 mM). The detergent, DTT, and other low-molecular-weight components were removed by repeated dilution in 100 mM Tris-HCl UA buffer (containing 8 M urea, pH 8.5), followed by filtration through 10-kDa ultrafiltration units (Pall Corporation, USA). The filters were washed three times with 100 \u03bcl of UA buffer, followed by twice washes with 100 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were then digested using mass spectrometry-grade trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate by incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C and 800 rpm. The enzyme:substrate ratio was 1:50. The effluent was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min and filtered twice with 50 \u03bcl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The effluent was combined and then acidified with 10% trifluoroacetate (TFA) to stop the reaction (the final concentration of TFA was 0.4%). The resulting peptides were desalted using a Pierce C18 Tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and vacuum-dried. Prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, peptide samples were re-suspended in 40 \u03bcl of 0.1% v/v formic acid (FA) and 5% v/v acetonitrile (ACN) solution.",

Peptide separation was carried out in a C18 capillary column (75 \u03bcm \u00d7 150 mm; Acclaim PepMap RSLC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 300 nl/min. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents: 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water (solvent A) and 0.08% FA in 80% acetonitrile (ACN, solvent B). The following gradients were used: 0\u20133% B in 8 min, 3\u20138% B in 2 min, 8\u201328% B in 76 min, 28\u201345% B in 17 min, 45\u201399% B in 2 min, 99% B in 5 min, 99\u20133% B in 1 min, 3% B in 14 min. Then the separated peptides were analyzed in the Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer operated in the positive ion mode (nanospray voltage was 2.0 kV and source temperature was 250\u00b0C). The MS data were acquired using the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. The mass spectrometer was operated in the Top-20 data-dependent mode with automatic switching between MS/MS and the full-scan MS mode (350\u20132,000 m/z) that was operated at a resolution of 70,000 with automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3 \u00d7 106 ions and a maximum ion transfer (IT) of 20 ms.

The M and N proteins were analyzed similarly on the basis of PEDV CV777 strain database (seven total entries, downloaded 11/10/18). The following parameters were applied for the search: enzyme, trypsin; missed cleavages, 2; minimum peptide length, 7; de-isotopic, TRUE; fixed modification, carbamidomethyl (C), variable modification, oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N-terminus); decoy database pattern, reverse; label-free quantification (LFQ), TRUE; LFQ minimum ratio count, 2; iBAQ, TRUE; match between runs, 2 min; peptide false discovery rate (FDR) \u2264 0.01; protein FDR \u2264 0.01. MaxQuant output files were analyzed with standard settings in the Perseus software (v.1.6.2.3, http://www.perseus-framework.org) (36). LFQ intensity values were used as the quantitative measurement of protein abundance for subsequent analysis. The data matrix was first filtered for the removal of contaminants and reverse decoy data. Each of the confident protein identification involves at least two unique peptides. LFQ intensity values were log2 transformed (37), and each sample was assigned to its corresponding group (Control, PEDV, or PEDV + PR). Proteins were filtered based on valid values (Min. number of values: four, Mode: in total). A data-imputation step was conducted to replace missing values with those that simulate signals of low abundant proteins (38). The latter were chosen randomly from a distribution specified by a downshift of 1.8 times the standard deviation (SD) of all measured values and a width of 0.3 times the SD. Two sample t-tests were performed for all relevant comparisons using a cutoff of P < 0.05 on the post imputation datasets to identify statistically significant differentially regulated proteins (DRPs).",

Traditional vaccine strategy cannot either provide a full protection for piglets or ensure a satisfying control of PEDV infection and spreading. Therefore, the development of safe, effective, and inexpensive antiviral drugs remains a great challenge to modern medicine. PR is a natural isoflavonoid extracted from Gegen in the traditional Chinese herb medicine. As a potential antiviral drug, effects of PR on PEDV infection are unknown. To date, although the proteomic technique has been widely applied to virus\u2013host interaction studies, little information is available about the protein profiles of piglets infected with PEDV.

Although the reduction in diarrhea rate was not statistically significant due to the small sample size, the decreasing trend in diarrhea rate and the weaker clinical symptoms indicated that the piglets in the PEDV + PR group were recovering better from illness. Similarly, dietary supplementation with soy isoflavone increased ADG and reduced the incidence of diarrhea in weaned piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide (45). These results support the notion that isoflavonoid could be used to treat diarrhea (46).

Similar results were found for the N and M protein levels, which were determined by the proteomic analysis (data not shown). These results indicated that PR could inhibit the replication of PEDV at different stages of its life cycle. Nevertheless, additional comprehensive studies are needed to verify this notion. In the current work, in vitro studies were performed with monkey cells and in vivo studies with piglets. Although they are different species, both of them are highly susceptible to PEDV, and PR could inhibit the replication of PEDV in both species. This suggests that PR was effective against PEDV in vitro and in vivo. Jejunal and ileal villus enterocytes are the main targets of PEDV replication (47), and PEDV also appears in feces and mesenteric lymph nodes (48). Consistently, we found that the piglet small intestine was the main target of PEDV. Intriguingly, the mRNA levels of N and M genes were extremely high in the ileum of piglets, even higher than those in the jejunum. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of N and M genes were also high in colonic contents. Importantly, PR administration decreased the expression of the viral genes in the ileum, jejunal, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes, indicating that PR plays an antiviral role in a large part of the gut. Previous studies showed that PR inhibited HIV-1 replication and human respiratory syncytial virus activities in vitro (20, 21). Some medicinal herbal extracts, such as oleanane triterpenes from the flowers of Camellia japonica, Sophorae radix, Acanthopanacis cortex, Sanguisorbae radix, and Torilis fructus, can inhibit PEDV replication (49, 50). To date, there is little information regarding an anti-PEDV effect of PR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that PR inhibited PEDV replication both in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "Cluster analyses are usually used to build groups of functionally related genes or proteins, thereby interpreting and identifying DRPs among different groups. In this study, nearly all of the overlapped DRPs (29/31) between the PEDV and Control groups or between the PEDV + PR and PEDV groups were reversely regulated by PR intervention, which could be clearly visualized by the heat-maps. Several functional enrichment analyses highlighted the importance of the interferon signaling pathway. Specifically, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and several ISGs were selectively upregulated at mRNA or protein levels in response to PEDV infection. This result is inconsistent with the previous report that PEDV antagonized interferon response (10, 55). Because almost all of the previous studies were conducted in vitro, the inconsistency may be attributed to the fact that results of in vitro experiments may not accurately reflect the situation in vivo. Moreover, an in vivo study performed by Annamalai et al. (56) demonstrated that serum IFN-\u03b1 could be augmented at the early stage of PEDV infection. Of particular interest, PR administration appeared to regulate the interferon signaling pathway by maintaining the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and ISGs at their normal physiological levels. It is noteworthy that GBP2, interferon-inducible guanylate-binding protein 2, was markedly upregulated in the PEDV + PR group. GBPs play an important role in antiviral infection (57). Further studies are warranted to determine whether PR exerts an antiviral effect by regulating GBP2 expression. Overall, these results indicated that PR regulated the interferon signaling pathway in PEDV-infected piglets.",

Such a function of NF-\u03baB in PEDV infection is supported by several lines of evidence (32, 43, 58). Our results showed that PEDV induced NF-\u03baB activation in vivo and that PR supplementation inhibited the NF-\u03baB activation, which may contribute to the decrease in the expression of interferon-related genes and the production of cytokines. This is consistent with the previous findings that PR has an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro and in vivo (59, 60). Therefore, we suggest that PR is beneficial for restoring immune homeostasis after PEDV infection by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation.",
