While the transmission routes for some diseases are well documented, the precise mode of transmission is uncertain for many infections, particularly for those pathogens that cause health\u2010care\u2013acquired infections (HCAIs). Although it is probable that the majority of transmission occurs via contact routes (Sax et al., 2009), there is increasing recognition that the air plays an important role in disease spread (Li et al., 2007). Understanding the role that ventilation airflow plays in the dispersion of infectious microorganisms is tantamount to assessing exposure to pathogens and hence infection risk. This study aims to provide an analytical link between airborne hospital infection spread, ventilation design, and outbreak management.",

Examples include Influenza A (e.g. H5N1 and H7N9) (Reed & Kemmerly, 2009), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Escombe et al., 2010), measles (Atkinson, Chartier, Pessoa\u2010Silva, Jensen, & Li, 2009), and norovirus (Teunis et al., 2008). One of the most infamous examples occurred in 2003 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong. Analysis of airflow patterns and outbreak data demonstrated that ventilation routes were critical in the short\u2010 and long\u2010range spread of aerosolized coronavirus (Li, Huang, Yu, Wong, & Qian, 2005). Ventilation is recognized as an important infection control approach in health\u2010care design, with strategies such as mechanical ventilation and pressure zoning set out in international (Atkinson et al., 2009) and national guidance (Department of Health, 2007).",

Liao, Chang, and Liang (2005) presented a probabilistic transmission dynamic model to assess indoor airborne infection risks and Ko, Burge, Nardell, and Thompson (2001) and Ko, Thompson, and Nardell (2004) developed models for tuberculosis spread incorporating a zonal ventilation model. A number of authors have also looked at control strategies, including Wein and Atkinson (2009), who modeled infection control measures for pandemic influenza; Brienen, Timen, Wallinga, Van Steenbergen, and Teunis (2010), who analyzed the effect of mask use on the spread of influenza; and King, Noakes, and Sleigh (2015), who developed a stochastic model to link airborne and contact transmission. It is also worth mentioning the recent work by Carruthers et al. (2018), where a zonal ventilation model similar to the one considered in this article is linked to a dose\u2013response approach to estimate the risk of infection after an accidental release of bacteria Francisella tularensis in a microbiology laboratory.",

While the previous approach enabled exploration of the basic interaction between the ventilation and the outbreak, there are a number of limitations:\nThe epidemic dynamics are represented through a simple SI epidemic model, not accounting for relevant factors such as the discharge and admission of patients, or the detection and declaration of the outbreak.Results reported by Noakes and Sleigh (2009) have high variability, which is related to the fact that they were obtained by means of stochastic simulations of the epidemic process.The large number of parameters associated with each ventilation scenario makes it difficult to identify, from stochastic simulations, the specific factors of the ventilation air distribution that facilitate or mitigate epidemic spread. We refer the reader to Keeling and Ross (2007) where the limitations of analyzing this type of epidemic processes by simulation are discussed in more detail, and where the benefits of following exact analytical approaches instead are highlighted.",

The air is assumed to be uniformly mixed within each zone; however, there is incomplete mixing between the zones and unbalanced zone boundaries allow for the effect of directional flow to be examined. In particular, the per capita infection rate \u03bbk for susceptible individuals at zone k is defined as \u03bbk=pkCk, where Ck is the concentration of infectious material at zone k and pk is the pulmonary rate of these individuals. We note that this concentration could depend on the number of infected individuals, ij, in every zone 1\u2264j\u2264M, due to airflow. In Noakes and Sleigh (2009), the spatial distribution of infectious material is represented through the differential equation:\n(2)VkdCkdt=qkik\u2212Qo,kCk\u2212\u2211j\u03b2kjCk+\u2211j\u03b2jkCj,1\u2264k\u2264M,where Vk is the volume of zone k, qkik is the generation rate of infectious quanta, Qo,k represents the extract ventilation rate in zone k, and \u2211j\u03b2kjCk and \u2211j\u03b2jkCj amount to the volume flow of air between zones k and j.

Once this procedure for computing infection rates is proposed, stochastic simulations for the SI epidemic dynamics are carried out in Noakes and Sleigh (2009) by following steps (i)\u2013(iv) (Noakes & Sleigh, 2009), which assume exponentially distributed interevent times and make use of the property depicted in Equation (1).",

In Section 2.2, we now go on to exploit this, to link the zonal ventilation model with a multicompartment SIS model with detection, to evaluate the infection spread dynamics within the hospital ward until detection of the outbreak. Instead of carrying out stochastic simulations, we present an exact approach for analyzing a summary statistic of the outbreak: the total number of infections occurring until the outbreak ends or is detected and declared. This exact approach does not only allow us to compute this quantity of interest, but it also allows one to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, so that the impact that different characteristics of the ventilation setting has on this summary statistic can be evaluated.",

Moreover, we consider that the nosocomial outbreak will go undetected by health\u2010care workers for some time, and incorporate this fact into our model by considering that each infected individual in zone i can be discovered/detected at some rate \u03b4i. The reciprocal \u03b4i\u22121 represents the average time until some symptoms arise that alert health\u2010care workers to a patient's infection, or the average time until the infected individual is detected through screening policies put in place at this hospital ward.

For example, norovirus causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that are common to many diseases and conditions. The National Guidelines on the Management of Outbreaks of Norovirus Infection in Health\u2010Care Settings (National Disease Surveillance Centre, 2003), issued by the National Disease Surveillance Centre in Ireland, requires for D=2 patients to show these symptoms in a hospital ward for a potential norovirus outbreak declaration.

Corresponding mean values E[R] are reported in Table IV. We note that zones 3a and 3b are equivalent to zones 1a and 1b, for all ventilation settings in Fig. 2, and thus we do not test them. For zones near the corridor (i.e., 1b and 2b), ventilation setting B is identified as the best one, while D is identified as the worst one. We note that ventilation setting B has no extract ventilation in zones 1b and 2b (Qo,1b=Qo,2b=0), but it directs the airflow instead toward corridor areas. In this setting B, corridor areas have no patients and significant ventilation, with airflow unbalance from bays to corridor areas acting in practice as an infection control measure. Thus, our results suggest that the spread control ability of a given ventilation setting depends on the location of the patient starting the outbreak as well as the airflow direction. However, from results in Fig. 4 and Table IV, ventilation setting D seems to perform poorly regardless of the initial infective location, suggesting that some ventilation settings might be inadvisable regardless of this location (i.e., if this location is unknown).",

On the other hand, when the initial infective patient is located in zone 1a, results in Table X can be compared to those in Table III for (\u03b4\u22121,\u03b20)=(12h,9m3/ min ). For zone 1a, values of E[R] are larger in Table X than in Table III; if the nosocomial outbreak is initiated by an infective patient in zone 1a, more infections during this outbreak should be expected under ward overoccupancy. This might not be only related to having more patients in the ward under overoccupancy (21 instead of 18), but also to the potential of patients in the corridor to act as infection links between bays. For example, under overoccupancy, an infective individual in zone 1a might infect individuals in bay 2 by, as a first step, infecting individuals in the corridor areas. These people then might more easily infect individuals in bay 2, before being discharged, due to being in closer proximity and depending on the particular ventilation setting in place in the ward.",

On the other hand, less advantageous ventilation schemes are dependent on the value of q.

The interplay between ventilation of the hospital ward and location of the initially infective patient starting the outbreak implies that recommendations on where to locate potentially infected (e.g., newly admitted) patients in a given hospital ward could be issued depending on the ventilation in place in the ward.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this link is carried out by defining in detail the CTMC for the infection spread, where infection rates at each ventilation zone are in fact functions \u03bbj(i1,\u22ef,iM) of the number of infectives in each zone at any given time, and where (i1,\u22ef,iM) represents in fact a state of the CTMC under study.

The results demonstrate that the ventilation flow settings may influence the dispersion of airborne pathogens and hence the risk of transmission; however, these should be interpreted with caution. We assume a steady\u2010state ventilation scenario with the flow pattern replicated exactly between neighboring bays 1, 2, and 3. In reality, the flows will not be exactly identical for every bay, and other factors such as heat sources and movement of people will alter the mixing with and between zones. In particular, corridor ventilation often has a directional flow due to wider spacing of ventilation supply/extract grilles, which may hinder or improve the control of infection. However, the analysis we have carried out gives some clear insight into why particular directional flows influence risk, and the relative importance of detection strategies, ventilation control, and occupancy.",

This is similar to the model recently proposed by L\u00f3pez\u2010Garc\u00eda and Kypraios (2018), as a unified framework for modeling the spread of nosocomial infections. We note that this epidemic model structure would be especially relevant for pathogens with no or short (i.e., negligible compared to the average patient's LOS) noninfectious or latent periods, and where the infectious period is long enough so that recovery of patients does not occur before discharge (or detection). Depending on the hospital ward under analysis and the average LOS of patients in this ward, this could be the case for influenza or norovirus. Pathogens with nonnegligible incubation periods (e.g., 7\u201321 days for measles) might require more complex stochastic epidemic model structures such as the SEIR (susceptible\u2013exposed\u2013infective\u2013recovered). On the other hand, when analyzing hospital wards with longer average patient LOS, so that individuals may become infected and recover during their stay, SIRS\u2010type epidemic models would be required to represent the recovery of patients (I\u2192R) before discharge (R\u2192S) occurs. We note here that in principle, the methodology outlined in Section 3 can be extended to any of these compartmental\u2010based epidemic models for the disease spread dynamics, where the link between the deterministic zonal ventilation model for the airflow dynamics and the stochastic epidemic model for disease spread dynamics would still be as in Section 2. In a similar way, more complex epidemic model structures could allow one to study the infection spread dynamics after outbreak detection and declaration occurs. In this article, we have focused instead on the impact of ventilation on disease spread until the end or declaration of the outbreak. Considering these alternative compartmental\u2010based epidemic model structures could be the aim of future work.",
