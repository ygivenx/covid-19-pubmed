The unique digestion of dsRNA by Lassa virus NP probably removes this pathogen-associated molecular pattern, and allows the virus to replicate without strong interference by the innate immune system. Structural features that confer this unique enzymatic specificity to NP were not apparent from previous crystal structures of the NP exonuclease, in which no substrate was bound. Here we present the crystal structure of the exonuclease domain of Lassa NP in complex with eight bases of dsRNA. This structure demonstrates that the unique substrate specificity is conferred by an extremely limited number of residues outside the enzymatic active site.",

Structure determination of LASV NP\u0394340/E391A\u2013dsRNA by molecular replacement was carried out in PHENIX[15] using the uncomplexed NP\u0394340 structure as a search model. One copy of NP\u0394340 was found in the asymmetric unit. Initial Fo-Fc difference maps and 2Fo-Fc maps generated from the molecular replacement solution showed clear density for NP\u0394340, as well as additional density for the dsRNA, which was not present in the search model (Figure 1). The dsRNA was built manually. Iterative cycles of model building were performed using Coot [16] and subsequent rounds of refinement were carried out using PHENIX. 5% of the reflections were set aside for R\nfree calculations. Simulated annealing was employed early in refinement to reduce model bias of the molecular replacement search model and simulating-annealing omit maps were used to confirm the RNA density. Custom hydrogen-bonding restraints between base-pairing nucleotides were generated using the \u2018PDB to 3D restraints\u2019 server [17] to maintain proper RNA base hydrogen-bonding distances. Initial models were uploaded to the server to identify hydrogen-bonding base pairs and to generate weighted ideal distance restraints of 2.9 \u00c5 between hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors of opposing nucleotide bases, which were then added to the refinement. The final NP\u0394340/E391A\u2013dsRNA structure has an R\nfree of 19.70% and Rwork of 25.44% using all data to 2.9 \u00c5 (Table 1).",

The single all-purine and all-pyrimidine strands were annealed to yield dsRNAs that each contain one all-purine and one all-pyrimidine strand. Digestion of dsRNA by Lassa NP is sequence-independent, and thus, there is equal likelihood for either the purine-containing or the pyrimidine-containing strand to be digested. Correspondingly, the electron density does not distinguish between the two. Hence, we have arbitrarily modeled the strand leading into the active site (the substrate strand) as the purine-containing strand and the complementary, non-substrate strand as the pyrimidine-containing strand (Figure 1 and Figure 2).",

Alignment of the Lassa NP-dsRNA complex, with structures of ISG-20 [5] and \u03b5186 [6], each in complex with a mononucleotide, shows that the positional arrangement of the active site nucleotide is extremely similar amongst all three DEDDh exonucleases (Figure 3b). In ISG-20 and \u03b5186, the site B metal ions are coordinated by four water molecules. The site B ion Lassa NP may also be coordinated by water in a similar fashion, although water molecules are not visible at this resolution (Figure 3c). The site A metal ion missing in this mutant structure would likely be coordinated by the carboxylate oxygens of D389, E391 and D566, as was observed in our wild-type structure, and may also be coordinated by the phosphate oxygens of RNA base G8, as these exist in close proximity to the wild-type position of the site A metal.",

However, among the DEDDy family, which has a tyrosine residue rather than a histidine in the active site, the exonuclease domain of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF) has been crystallized with a longer, 12 bp double-stranded DNA [19]. Comparison of Lassa NP in complex with dsRNA and KF in complex with dsDNA demonstrates a different mode of binding between the two exonucleases. The dsRNA bound to Lassa NP remains base-paired throughout the entire length, including the final residue bound into the active site.

These exonucleases contain a basic loop motif adjacent to the active site that may facilitate melting of duplex DNA in order to provide a suitable single-stranded 3\u2032 end for the active site [6], [9], [19]. Certainly, mutation of this basic loop in KF and Trex2 reduces exonuclease activity [9], [21], suggesting a role for the motif in binding nucleic acid, particularly the non-substrate strand as it extends from the active site [9], [21]. We note that in Lassa NP, the site that is positionally equivalent to the basic loop of the other exonucleases is neither basic nor loop-shaped, but is instead much shorter and mostly hydrophobic (Figure 7). However, Lassa NP does encode a different basic loop located on the opposite side of the active site. Mutation of the basic residues in this loop also disrupts exonuclease activity [3]. This loop is in the correct position to interact with the non-substrate strand as it is \u201cfreed\u201d from the duplex as the exonuclease reaction proceeds. Importantly, the \u201crelocation\u201d of the basic loop motif in Lassa NP may account for the differential mode of binding of duplex substrates seen between Lassa NP and the other exonucleases.",

Processive exonucleases such as Lassa NP require the stepwise procession of the substrate into and the subsequent removal of the product out of the active site. It is possible that interaction between Y429 and the RNA may facilitate this action. This is supported by the fact that mutation of Y429 to alanine or leucine permits binding, but greatly inhibits the digestion of RNA. Interestingly, other DEDDh exonucleases such as ISG-20 [5], Trex 1 [7], Trex 2 [18] and \u03b5186 [6] do not contain a Tyr or other aromatic residue equivalent to Y429 of Lassa NP, and as previously mentioned, no other DEDDh exonuclease has been shown to have strict specificity for a double-stranded substrate. Thus, biochemical analysis and comparison to other exonuclease structures suggests that the specificity of Lassa NP for double-stranded substrates over single-stranded substrates is likely derived from the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between the tyrosine ring and the RNA base that previously complemented the one cleaved off in the active site.",

            "text": "Further, a hydrogen bond between the RNA-specific 2\u2032OH and the G392 in the active site could explain why the exonuclease activity of Lassa NP is specific for RNA over DNA in the substrate strand. This additional hydrogen bond, which would only be present in RNA, may help anchor the nucleotide within the active site. Although the contact is to the main-chain nitrogen and G392 is not part of the DEDDh motif, previous work demonstrated that mutation of G392 to alanine disrupts both the exonuclease function and the immunosuppressive function of NP [3]. The position of the main-chain nitrogen afforded by the uniquely flexible glycine seems to be important for proper orientation of the 3\u2032 nucleotide of an incoming RNA strand relative to critical residues of the active site. Mutation of this residue to anything other than glycine would result in \u03c6 and \u03c8 backbone dihedral angles outside allowable regions, unless several surrounding residues, including the active site D389 and E391, rearrange to accommodate it. Hence, mutation of G392 may force the active site into a non-functional arrangement. Curiously, the coronaviruses are the only other viruses known to encode a DEDDh exonuclease. SARS-CoV nsp14 was recently shown to be involved in RNA synthesis and genome fidelity [22], [23]. Notably, nsp14 will digest ssRNA and dsRNA, but not DNA, and also has a conserved glycine in the same position as Lassa NP G392. Although structural information is not yet available for nsp14, it is possible that in this enzyme as well, the \u03c6 and \u03c8 backbone dihedral angles uniquely available to a glycine residue dictate the strict specificity for RNA over DNA.",

Y429 appears to be important for the processive motion of the RNA, and is conserved among close relatives of Lassa such as LCMV and Lujo virus. Other arenaviruses, such as Junin and Machupo have a histidine at this position, which could provide a similar interaction with the RNA as a tyrosine.",
