However, none of these have yet been approved by FDA for clinical treatments. Therefore, it is imperative to develop more new FTIs.",

Many reports have indicated that computational method is a time-saving and effort-saving approach to discover new candidates including molecular docking [10], virtual screening [11], and 3DQSAR [12, 13]. Virtual screening (VS) has emerged as a powerful approach to complement the array of existing high-throughput screening technologies [14, 15]. Using computer-aided VS, potential leads can be rapidly identified in silico in order to narrow the range of molecules to be tested in vitro and in vivo. In this study, virtual screening was used as a 3D query in an in-house chemical database over 900 compounds screening to retrieve potential FTIs.",

Molecular docking technology which has been increasingly used in the course of drug research and development is the representative of receptor-based virtual screening [16, 17]. In this paper, molecular docking experiments were carried out using Discovery Studio 2.5 software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with fully automated docking tool using \u201cCDOCKER\u201d protocol [18\u201322] employing CHARMm force field to investigate the possible inhibitors for farnesyltransferase. The CDOCKER energy (-(protein-ligand interaction energies)) of best poses docked into the receptor of all the 900 compounds was calculated and compared with that of Compound 4 which is a new potent farnesyltransferase inhibitor based on the ethylenediamine scaffold. As a result, IMB-1406 was found to have the highest CDOCKER energy and similar structural framework to the crystallized inhibitor (Compound 4) [23] of farnesyltransferase, as shown in Figure 1.",

In Figure 2B, there are three hydrogen bonding interactions between the N22 and O33 positions of IMB-1406 and R202\u03b2.

The uptake of 5,5\u2032,6,6\u2032-tetrachloro -1,1\u2032,3,3\u2032- tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1), a lipophilic cationic fluorescent dye accumulated in mitochondria, is positively correlated with the mitochondrial membrane potential [27]. HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 8 \u03bcM) of IMB-1406 for 72 h prior to staining with JC-1. Then the numbers of cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential in different cell groups were determined by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Figure 5, the percentage of cells with typical apoptotic morphology increases in a dose-dependent fashion (0.53%, 6.14%, 13.8% and 34.92%, respectively). Our results reveal that incubation with IMB-1406 increases the number of cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane potentials and induces apoptosis.",

The mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, which induce the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in the activation of the caspase cascade and the induction of apoptotic cell death [28, 29]. To explore the possible role of a mitochondrial-related pathway in IMB-1406-induced apoptosis, the effects of IMB-1406 on the levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6, IMB-1406 treatment shows concentration-dependent effects in upregulating the expressions of Bax and downregulating Bcl-2. In addition, caspase-3 is activated in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with IMB-1406 at 2 \u03bcM, 4 \u03bcM and 8 \u03bcM for 72 h. These results reveal that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells via a mitochondria-dependent pathway.",

Moreover, preliminary study on mechanism revealed that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the S phase, altering anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. Meanwhile, molecular docking study suggested one of the possible targets for IMB-1406 was protein farnesyltransferase. Together, IMB-1406 is a novel conjugate with potent antitumor activity, and it could contribute to a better understanding of structure-based drug design to facilitate drug discovery. Based on this, further structural modifications, SAR studies and enzyme inhibitory activity of IMB-1406 are currently in progress.",
