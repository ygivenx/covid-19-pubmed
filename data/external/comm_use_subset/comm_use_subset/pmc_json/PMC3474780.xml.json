Excessive signaling through TLR2 can cause a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, leading to excessive inflammation and tissue damage resulting in a potentially lethal outcome [7], [9], [10], [11]. In response to HSV-1 infection, TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice show both dramatically enhanced survival and attenuated intracranial generation of CCL5 (Rantes), CCL2 (MCP-1) and IL-6; levels of these cytokines are directly correlated with the severity of HSV-1 infection and the development of immunopathology [9], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Therefore, survival from HSV-1 encephalitis is determined not only by lytic viral infection but also by the balance between pro-inflammatory and down-regulatory anti-inflammatory mechanisms (as well as anti-viral signaling pathways) that limit the pro-inflammatory TLR2 response to infection. However, down-regulatory pathways that interface with TLR2 signaling are poorly described. The HSV-1 model of encephalitis is an ideal model to probe the role of how down-regulatory pathways impact TLR2 biology.",

            "text": "Mouse CD200R1 is a 326 amino acid glycoprotein expressed on the surface of myeloid and glial cells [16]. CD200R1 interacts with CD200, which is expressed on the surface of neurons, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and lymphocytes [17], . CD200R1 has a 67 amino acid intracellular domain with a unique inhibitory tyrosine motif. Stimulation of CD200R1 by CD200 leads to the phosphorylation of these tyrosines, which recruit the adapter proteins Docking Proteins (Doks) 2 and 1 and SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) to initiate inhibitory signaling and suppress cytokine and chemokine generation [19], [20], [21]. In contrast to CD200R1, the small cytoplasmic domain of CD200 lacks a signaling motif [16], [17]. The interaction of CD200 with CD200R1 down-regulates innate and adaptive immune responses in models of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), arthritis, transplantation, and acute pulmonary inflammation [16], [17], [18], [22]. However, the specific pro-inflammatory signal transduction pathways in macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells that are down-regulated by CD200R1 [19], [20], [21], are poorly described. Specifically, how CD200R1 impacts TLR2 signaling, particularly in macrophages, is not known.",

To date, they have employed CD200\u2212/\u2212 mice, limiting their scope to probing the entire CD200:CD200R1 axis and not capable of detecting other roles for CD200R1 in myeloid cells, i.e., intrinsic functions of CD200R1 independent of CD200 ligand interaction. In the case of influenza and meningococcus, CD200\u2212/\u2212 mice are prone to the effects of inflammation/sepsis [18], [23]. This is also the case for Toxoplasma encephalitis [24]. In regards to Leishmania, redox defense mechanisms used by the host are suppressed by the CD200R1:CD200 axis in L. amazonensis, which induces CD200 expression in host cells, so that CD200\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from the pathogen. However L. major grows more slowly in macrophages and does not induce CD200 expression in host tissue [25]. More recently studies of mouse hepatitis corona virus [26] have shown that the release of inhibition by disrupting the CD200:CD200R1 axis leads to an augmentation of pro-inflammatory signaling and increased recruitment of leukocytes leading to the rapid clearance of virus.",

This strategy was therefore distinct from that of a previously generated CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mouse in which only exons 2\u20134 (the extracellular domain) were targeted [32]. The targeting vector (Figure S1A) was constructed by using a 1.3 kbp DNA fragment as the short arm. The long arm was a 10 kbp genomic fragment, which starts from EcoRV to SpeI. In this strategy, 1.2 kbp upstream of the ATG start codon, exon 1, and 2.9 kbp of intron 1 were replaced by the Neo gene cassette, resulting in a frame shift mutation and the generation of stop codons in each of the 3 reading frames. To confirm successful gene targeting, DNA was prepared from tail veins and analyzed by both PCR and Southern blot. For Southern blotting, tail vein genomic DNA was digested with Nsi1, resolved by 0.7% agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed with a 550 bp genomic fragment localized within intron 1 to distinguish targeted and CD200R1+/+ DNA. As shown in Figure S1B, DNA from CD200R1+/+ mice gave a predicted single band of 7.8 kbp. CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 DNA showed a single band of the predicted size of 2.7 kbp. Both bands were detected in DNA from heterozygote mice. When analyzed by PCR, tail vein DNA of CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a characteristic 1.5 kbp band that was absent in CD200R1+/+ DNA (Figure S1C), whereas CD200R1+/+ tail vein DNA showed only a 1.4 kbp band. DNA from heterozygous mice showed both bands. Finally, when analyzed by flow cytometry, CD200R1+/+, but not CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 elicited peritoneal macrophages expressed CD200R1 (Figure S1D).",

We therefore examined the interaction of HSV-1 with CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Elicited macrophages from both CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with HSV-1 (multiplicity of infection; MOI = 10), or challenged with Pam2CSK4 (100 ng/ml), or LPS (100 ng/ml), and levels of IL-6, CCL5 (Rantes), or CCL2 (MCP-1) were measured at 24, 48, and 72 h. HSV-1 infected CD200R1+/+ macrophages produced 35,000 pg/ml IL-6 24 h after stimulation, which rose to 60,000 pg/ml by 48 h and 72 h (Figure 1A). In contrast, CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages only generated between 20,000 to 30,000 pg/ml IL-6 in response to HSV-1 stimulation. Pam2CSK4 stimulated IL-6 levels averaged 70,000 to 80,000 pg/ml over the 3 day experiment in CD200R1+/+ cells, whereas CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages generated only 10,000 to 20,000 pg/ml. Similar to the IL-6 response, the generation of CCL5 (Rantes) by CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages stimulated with HSV-1 was blunted when compared to CD200R1+/+ macrophages. To address whether the decrease in CCL5 (Rantes) was a property of signaling by TLR2, or secondary to low levels of IFN, we determined whether CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 peritoneal macrophages exhibit a blunted CCL5 (Rantes) response to stimulation with the TLR4 ligand LPS. In contrast to the attenuated response to TLR2 stimulation, there was only a modest decrease in the levels of IL-6 at 24 h and 48 h and no difference in the levels of CCL5 (Rantes) generated in response to TLR4 stimulation via LPS in CD200R1+/+ or CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 cells at any time point (Figure 1A). In the case of CCL2 (MCP-1) generation, no difference was found between CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 and CD200R1+/+ with any stimulant; though LPS induced a marked increase in CCL2 (MCP-1) expression in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 cells.",

Expression of pro-IL-1\u03b2 is regulated at the transcriptional level by NF-\u03baB, which, for HSV-1, is activated downstream of TLR2 signaling. The second signal activates assembly of the inflammasome complex and cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 into its mature secreted form, IL-1\u03b2. This can be triggered by a variety of mechanisms, including extracellular ATP acting on the P2X receptor, reactive oxygen species, or potassium efflux triggered by the antibiotic Nigericin [35]. The interaction of double stranded DNA and viral replication intermediates with intracellular DNA sensors can also induce inflammasome assembly [3], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. The assembly and function of the inflammasome is therefore dependent on the quantity of viral replication intermediates within cells. We therefore hypothesized that if CD200R1 was required for efficient viral replication, then CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages should show lower levels of inflammasome formation and impaired conversion of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1\u03b2.",

The expression of CD200R1 on the surface of WT and TLR2\u2212/\u2212 elicited macrophages was determined by flow cytometry 24 h after infection with HSV-1 (Figure 2A). As an internal control, CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 cells were also included. There was no difference in CD200R1 expression levels between TLR2+/+ and TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Interestingly, the surface expression of CD200R1 decreased 24 h after HSV-1 infection in both WT and TLR2\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Figure 2A). This was contrasted with the effect of CD200R1 on TLR2 expression. Following HSV-1 infection, TLR2 expression levels increased 12-fold in WT cells, but TLR2 expression was not increased in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Figure 2B). These results indicated that CD200R1 directly controls the inducible surface expression of TLR2 either directly or secondary to decreased viral replication and that it may play a role in the amplification of HSV-1 infection.",

When combined with the observation that CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice had lower levels of IFN-\u03b2 in brain and serum, the results suggest that there is decreased replication of HSV-1 in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 brains. To test this conclusion, CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected intracranially with 105 PFU HSV-1, and virus titers in whole brain homogenates were determined by plaque assay using Vero cells on days 1, 3, and 4 post-infection (Figure 5C). On day 1, brain titers were comparable between CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Though viral titers increased in both mice on day 2, CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significantly lower titers than CD200R1+/+ mice (not shown). HSV-1 titers were negligible in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 brains by day 3, with 60% of CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice having brain titers that were below the limit of detection. In contrast, HSV-1 titers from CD200R1+/+ brains were unchanged from day 1 to day 3. On day 4, viral titers from CD200R1+/+ brains had dropped slightly compared to their titers on day 3 but this was not statistically different. CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice, however, continued to have a high percentage of animals (42%) that had completely cleared the infection. Overall, the HSV-1 titers in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice were lower compared to CD200R1+/+ mice on day 4 but the difference in titers did not reach statistical significance. Importantly, approximately 50% of the CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice had cleared the infection by days 3 and 4, while HSV-1 continued to replicate at high levels in 100% of CD200R1+/+ mice.",

A majority of the CD8+ cells are directed to a single dominant gB498\u2013505 peptide and will specifically bind a MHC-gB-peptide-pentamer that can be monitored by flow cytometry [29], [30], [47], [48], [49]. CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with 104 PFU HSV-1 by intraperitoneal injection. The development of HSV-gB pentamer-specific CD8+ peripheral blood T cells was monitored up to 9 days post-infection (Figure 5E). In CD200R1+/+ mice, the percentage of gB-pentamer positive cells peaked 7 days after infection at approximately 14.4%, which decreased by half by day 9 (Figure 5E). In contrast, CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a blunted and delayed response that gradually rose to approximately 6.5% by day 9. This blunted CD8+ response is consistent with reduced HSV-1 replication in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice and provide additional evidence that CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice either more efficiently eliminate HSV-1 or lack the ability to support its sustained replication.",

This was consistent with the results seen in MEFs. Thus HSV-1 infection was attenuated both in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages and fibroblasts. We confirmed that both elicited peritoneal macrophages and MEFs expressed CD200R1 by immunofluorescence (Figure 6C). Furthermore, neither macrophages nor MEFs express CD200 message or protein (not shown); therefore the impact of CD200R1 on HSV-1 infection was independent of CD200R1:CD200 interaction but was dependent on CD200R1 expression itself. Overall, our findings indicate that CD200R1 plays an important intrinsic role in regulating TLR2 expression and signaling. In a TLR2-dependent viral model like such as HSV-1 infection, lack of CD200R1 expression leads to decreased inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production as well as a failure to upregulate TLR2, thus suggesting a link between TLR2 signaling and decreased viral titers.",

In models of EAE, Toxoplasma encephalitis, experimental autoimmune retinitis, collagen-induced arthritis and influenza-induced pneumonitis, CD200\u2212/\u2212 mice show enhanced inflammatory responses [17], [18], [24]. In the case of mouse hepatitis corona virus, the increased survival was attributed to release of inhibition, increased inflammation, and increased viral clearance. Therefore, the dramatic increase in survival of CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to CD200R1+/+ mice in response to intracranial HSV-1 appears to be paradoxical, or potentially explained by the same process. Though a large component of the mortality seen in HSV-1 encephalitis in C57BL/6 WT mice (with an intact type I IFN response) is secondary to the inflammatory response [6], [8], [9], our results emphasize that viral replication, as opposed to inflammation, can also be a key component of the lethal effects of HSV-1 encephalitis in mice. This was supported by the observation that no difference was found between brain chemokine/cytokines levels (with the exception of interferon-\u03b2, a marker for viral load) or in leukocyte recruitment into the brains of CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, our data strongly support a requisite role for CD200R1 in supporting the replication of HSV-1, and implicate decreased viral replication as the reason for increased viability of CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, although brain titers of HSV-1 in CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice were similar on day 1 post-infection, sustained virus infection was found only in wild type and not in knockout mice. A large proportion of CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice were essentially free of replicating virus by day 3\u20134 post-infection in contrast to CD200R1+/+ mice which continued to produce infectious HSV-1 virions in their brains over the entire 4 day course of the study.",

The decreased ability of HSV-1 to infect and/or replicate in tissues outside the brain in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice was supported by the blunted HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cell response to intraperitoneal HSV-1 infection. Finally, a role for CD200R1 in supporting viral replication was found by comparing elicited peritoneal macrophages and MEFs from CD200R1+/+ and CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice, in which viral infection was decreased in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 cells.",

            "text": "A unique role for CD200R1 in supporting (licensing) pro-inflammatory signaling by TLR2 was also found. This role was revealed by studies with elicited peritoneal macrophages in which the generation of IL-6 and CCL5 (Rantes) in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages was blunted by \u223c80% in response to TLR2 ligands and HSV-1; this was not observed in response to LPS suggesting a specific defect in TLR2-driven responses. Furthermore, CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages lacked the ability to assemble a functional inflammasome. It is unclear why IL-6 and CCL5 (Rantes) but not MCP-1 levels were reduced in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. It may be that there is differential regulation of IL-6 and CCL2 (MCP-1) generation via TLR2 signaling. Although these cytokines are both NF-\u03b2B driven, there are distinct transcription factors that drive expression of IL-6 or MCP-1. In previous studies we have noted that HSV-induced IL-6 is strictly dependent on TLR2 expression while some MCP-1 secretion still occurs in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 cells, albeit at reduced levels compared to TLR2+/+ macrophages [9]. Currently, the mechanism(s) are not known. It is also possible that CD200R1 regulates IL-6 and CCL2 (MCP-1) differently. It is also unclear why the expression of CCL5 (Rantes) but not CCL2 (MCP-1) is decreased in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 mice. It is possible that CCL5 (Rantes) secretion is secondary to decreased IFN, though ultimately this also is a consequence of the control of TLR2 signaling by CD200R1. An additional defect in TLR2 function, the inability to up-regulate the expression of TLR2 in response to HSV-1 infection, may contribute to the inability to perpetuate and amplify HSV-1 infection, though this may be secondary to the role of CD200R1 in regulating viral replication.",

            "text": "The role of CD200R1:CD200 interaction in determining the host response to pathogens is complex, and, when considered in the context of our current studies, is likely to be dependent on the mechanisms that the host uses to kill the specific pathogen. In the case of influenza and meningococcus, CD200\u2212/\u2212 mice are prone to the effects of inflammation/sepsis [18], [23], indicating that CD200R1:CD200 interaction is not likely to be involved in the regulation of cellular anti-viral mechanisms. As described above, this is also the case for Toxoplasma encephalitis [24]. In regards to Leishmania, redox defense mechanisms used by the host are suppressed by the CD200R1:CD200 axis in L. amazonensis, which induces CD200 expression in host cells, so that CD200\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from the pathogen. However L. major grows more slowly in macrophages and does not induce CD200 expression in host tissue [25]. In the case of HSV-1 and other members of the Herpesviridae family, the situation is somewhat analogous, but is more complex and involves a clearly distinct mechanism. In HSV-1, CD200R1 supports infection at or before the stage of early gene expression, which in turn regulates the surface expression of TLR2. Whether additional CD200R1-independent or CD200R1-dependent (intrinsic) intracellular mechanisms controlling viral replication are involved are not yet known, but would not be surprising. The decreased infection of HSV-1 at all time points in CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs as well as macrophages indicates that the situation is more complex than simply the suppression of a virus-toxic metabolite such as NO, which can be driven or amplified by TLR2. The effect of CD200R1 on HSV-1 infection in MEFs and macrophages occurred in the absence CD200 expression suggesting that CD200R1 intrinsically regulates virus replication. Because HSV-1 is a neurotropic virus and neurons express CD200 but not CD200R1 on their surface [50], [51], how the macrophage-specific mechanisms elucidated by our work function to exert their profound impact on HSV-1 replication and host survival in vivo are not straightforward. Even though macrophages and dendritic cells are relatively resistant to HSV-1 infection [52], our data indicate that they have the potential to be infected, and therefore could be important in mediating intraneuronal transmission or to serve as a reservoir of virus. As CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages would be deficient in these processes, the lack of CD200R1 could potentially slow the spread of virus within the brain. Alternatively or concomitantly, CD200R1+/+ macrophages may generate a factor that is required to sustain viral replication in neurons, or CD200R1\u2212/\u2212 macrophages may contribute to increased viral killing. Furthermore, how the impact of CD200R1 on TLR2 signaling affects viral replication in vivo is not fully elucidated. HSV-1 is known to target components of the TLR2 signaling pathway via expression of the viral protein ICP0, suggesting that TLR2 biology and HSV-1 biology are linked [53].",

CD150 contains a TxYxxV/I motif in its cytoplasmic tail that can bind SH2-containing molecules, ranging from tyrosine and inositol phosphatases and Src family kinases to adaptor molecules. The function of CD150 can vary depending on the molecule with which it interacts [27]. CD200R1 has neither a conventional ITIM nor an ITSM domain, and the range of potential interactions with its cytoplasmic tail is not known. Another example of a dual role for inhibitory receptors is the fact that for their activation receptors to become activated, NK cell inhibitory receptors must first interact with their cognate self-MHC ligands [54]. In fact, the role of CD200R1 in supporting the synthesis of IL-6 and CCL5 (Rantes) may not be direct. The blunted generation of IL-6 and CCL5 (Rantes) was determined after 24 h, so signaling by CD200R1 could impact the synthesis of other cytokines, which in turn regulate the generation of IL-6 and CCL5 (Rantes). However, the role of CD200R1 in regulating the surface expression of TLR2 expression suggests a direct link between these pathways.",
