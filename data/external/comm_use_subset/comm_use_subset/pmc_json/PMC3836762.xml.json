The disease is thus named hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The cases of HFRS in China account for nearly 90% of all HFRS cases worldwide [1]. During 1950-2007, 1,557,622 HFRS cases and 46,427 deaths from HFRS (a death rate of 3%) were reported in China [2], and HFRS cases are reported in most provinces and cities (28/31) of mainland China annually [2,3], making HFRS a notable public health problem. Shaanxi province, which is located in northwest of China, is one of the most seriously afflicted areas [4]. Over the past decade (2001-2010), the majority of HFRS cases (65%) occurred from October to December annually [4]. The composition of the population of HFRS cases has changed with the rapid development of society and the environment in recent years; however, the infected population is primarily 16- to 59-year-old farmers [4].

            "text": "HTNV (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. HTNV was the first hantavirus described and was isolated in 1978 [5]. The virion encloses three gene segments named L (large), M (medium), and S (small), which encode different proteins [6]. The L segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the M segment encodes two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and the S segment encodes a nucleocapsid protein (NP) [7]. Variation in the S and M segments may alter the virulence and antigenicity of hantaviruses [8]. The transmission pathway of hantavirus within rodents and from rodents to humans includes inhalation of aerosolized excreta (i.e., saliva, urine and feces), the consumption of contaminated food, or rodent bites [9]. Seven species of hantaviruses have been identified in China, but only HTNV, which is carried by Apodemus agrarius, and Seoul virus (SEOV), which is carried by Rattus norvegicus, are associated with HFRS [10\u201312]. However, the disease caused by HTNV is more clinically severe than that caused by SEOV [3]. HTNV has been reported to be the predominant etiological agent for HFRS in the Xi\u2019an district of Shaanxi province, and SEOV and other hantavirus species are seldom detected [4]. ",

Incorporation of a T7-promoter sequence onto the forward primer was essential for performing in vitro transcription with the T7 RNA polymerase, and the addition of oligo-(dT) at the end of the reverse primer allowed for the generation of a cRNA sequence with a poly(A) tail at its 3\u2019-end for stabilization. The use of two primer pairs ensured that the nucleotide sequences of the HTNV cRNA standards were identical to those in the HTNV genome.
