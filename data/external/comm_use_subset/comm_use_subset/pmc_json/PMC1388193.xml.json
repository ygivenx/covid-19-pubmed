Histologic determination was less specific in that it revealed only marked angiectasic-edematous phenomena of the stroma and eosinophil lymphoplasma cell inflammatory infiltration. That the finding was aspecific is obvious given the characteristics of the respiratory mucosa epithelium, which is composed of a pseudostratified pavimentous epithelium, with nuclear cells arranged at various heights; hence, epithelial cytomorphology does not permit the detection of multinucleation in histologic specimens. This aspect can be easily visualized by exfoliative cytology for the study of the specific morphology of each single cell.",
