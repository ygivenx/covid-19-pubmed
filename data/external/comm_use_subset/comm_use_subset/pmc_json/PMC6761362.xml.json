Patients having viral respiratory infections were identified through the hospital MedMined surveillance system. Patients were eligible to participate if they were adults, fluent in English or Spanish, and had a positive respiratory pathogen panel test within 3 days prior to the day of observation. Eligible patient participants were recruited in the patient room and provided written informed consent and authorization to use and disclose health information for the study.

Differences of contacts among groups were tested with the Kruskal-Wallis test (KW), followed by pairwise Wilcoxon test (W) to compare 2 groups, with P values adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Observations of HCWs were treated as independent because the small number of HCWs who participated repeatedly performed different care activities and the number of replicates was small. To evaluate the potential effect of different observers, total environmental fomite contacts and self-contacts by HCWs were compared between observers using the KW test.",

We found that the patient was the most commonly touched surface, contacted in 91% of the visits, which is consistent with the work of others [8, 9, 12, 13]. Bed surfaces, bed rail, IV pole, computer station, and tray table were among the most highly touched fomites by both HCWs and patients in this study, which is consistent with the work of others [8, 9]. The median contact rate on all fomites by HCWs was 37.8 contacts per hour, which is lower than the 93.1 contacts per hour reported by Cheng et al [9]. As many of these surfaces have been found to be contaminated with respiratory viruses and multidrug-resistant bacteria [5\u20137, 14], transmission via environmental surfaces is very plausible. The number of contacts by HCWs with patients and fomites and the performance of respiratory care activities have been associated with bacterial contamination on the gloves and hands of HCWs after patient care [15, 16]. This should motivate HCWs to reduced fomite contacts, improved cleaning and disinfection, and hand hygiene to reduce the potential for disease transmission.",

The difference in range may be due to the nature of care activities, which were not described in the previous studies. Furthermore, the higher median in this study may be due to the fact that we intentionally did not observe HCW-patient encounters anticipated to be very short and to not involve contacts with the patient or fomites. In our study, HCWs performed >1 healthcare activity in 22% of the observations, but the number of activities was not associated with the duration of the visit. The combinations of activities performed, however, did not necessarily coincide with defined roles of HCWs.",

These results were consistent with the findings of Smith et al [13], in which blood pressure stands and computer stations were handled in patient rooms during 13% and 26% of the HCW visits, respectively. Computer stations in the hospital we studied are permanently present in the patient room of the ICU and CDU wards, but could be portable (on wheels) in the other wards. A simulation study in a long-term care facility using a DNA marker showed that pathogens could disseminate from a television remote control to the hands of patients, to the room surfaces, and to the vital signs machine and medication cart [18]. Therefore, portable medical devices could transmit pathogens within and between patient rooms if they are not properly cleaned. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that \u201cnoncritical\u201d surfaces should be disinfected after use on each patient at the minimum [19]. At the hospital in which this study was conducted, the policy is that reusable medical equipment is disinfected between patients, but cleaning behaviors and efficacy was not observed in this study. Jinadatha et al [8] observed that portable medical devices were cleaned 17 times over 274 observations, though it is not clear if this cleaning is sufficient or insufficient. Cleaning of portable medical devices should be further explored as an infection prevention strategy.",

To our knowledge, self-contact patterns of HCWs during patient encounters have not been previously explored. In our study, providers and respiratory therapists, who often performed a physical examination and respiratory treatment, had a significantly higher number of self-contacts than HCWs with other roles. The mask and torso were the body parts most commonly touched by HCWs. Bacterial pathogens, including multidrug-resistant organisms, have been found on the gloves, gown, scrubs, and hands of HCWs working in ICUs [20, 21]. Brady et al [22] found that, upon contact during doffing, filtering face piece respirators contaminated with bacteriophage and fluorescein via droplets and droplet nuclei transferred materials to hands; a similar effect can be expected for masks. Doffing of PPE ensembles used for contact-transmissible diseases has been found to result in contamination of HCWs\u2019 hands and, less commonly, faces with surrogate materials placed on the PPE to simulate contamination by pathogen-containing body fluids [23\u201325]. Our observations of self-contact by HCWs highlight the potential for pathogen transfer between clothing, PPE, and hands.",

Mechanistic mathematical modeling describes how pathogens move through the environment, to estimate the magnitude of exposure among HCWs and patients, while quantitative microbial risk assessment estimates the probability of infection given an exposure in a susceptible person. Previous applications of this approach have characterized the contribution of different transmission routes to influenza risk [26] and the burden of occupationally acquired influenza in acute care hospitals [4]. Data collected about contact patterns in this study can inform the design and parameter values in such mechanistic exposure models, and will be explored in future work in conjunction with measured pathogen values.",

First, patient contact patterns were not fully characterized because we did not record patient contacts when a HCW was not present or when patients were in the bathroom. While we did observe that 10% of patients were walking during the HCW encounter, patients observed in bed may or may not have been mobile at other times, and we did not consider patient mobility in this analysis. Second, our findings did not take into account the activities of visitors, who have been found to touch many of the same environmental surfaces touched by HCWs and patients [9]. Third, there are some items in the far patient zone that may contact the patient or move into the near-patient zone when not observed (ie, stethoscope, pulse oximetry). Finally, this is an observational study, so it may be subject to the Hawthorne effect, in which participants change their behaviors because they know they are being observed. The impact of the Hawthorne effect, however, is likely to be small as HCWs continued to provide care as needed by patients, and during this study we observed poor compliance with the use and doffing of PPE [10].",
