As compared to mice, humans are naturally exposed to their own pathogens, often through recurrent infections, and are therefore a better source of antibodies that target the most relevant antigens and can reveal mechanisms of host\u2013pathogen interaction. Furthermore, given the genetic variability of the human population and the idiosyncrasies of the immune response, some individuals may generate antibodies with unusual potency or breadth. Finally, studies of the antibody response in humans can shed light on basic aspects of the immune response, such as the role of somatic mutations and the mechanisms that underpin the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies or autoantibodies, and possibly uncover examples of such mechanisms that may be uniquely developed or better identified in humans.",

            "text": "In the last decade, several methods have been developed to isolate human monoclonal antibodies. In principle, they come down to two basic approaches. The first approach consists of the isolation of single antigen\u2010specific B cells using a fluorescently tagged antigen as a bait, followed by cloning of immunoglobulin genes and expression of the recombinant antibodies in a cell line. This method is very effective, but requires that the target antigen is known and available in a purified form. In my laboratory, we developed an alternative approach based on high\u2010throughput screening of the antibodies produced by cultured B cells or plasma cells (Fig 1A). Memory B cells from selected donors are immortalized with high efficiency (>30%) by combining Epstein\u2013Barr virus (that delivers signal 1 and signal 2) with a TLR7 or TLR9 agonist (that delivers signal 3 required for potent activation of memory B cells) (Traggiai et al, 2004). The immortalized B cells proliferate and secrete large amounts of antibodies in the culture supernatant. Antigen\u2010specific plasma cells recovered following a booster immunization have lost proliferative capacity, but can be kept alive in cultures supplemented with IL\u20106 and stromal cells. In these cultures that mimic the survival niches of the bone marrow, a single plasma cell secretes antibodies at a constant rate of 100 pg/day (Corti et al, 2011). To facilitate the isolation of specific antibodies and the cloning of the VH/VL genes, both immortalized B cells and plasma cells are seeded in clonal conditions and cultures are handled with an automated liquid handling system. There are distinctive advantages in screening the repertoire of secreted antibodies. The first is that the approach is target\u2010agnostic, since screening can be done using functional assays, such as virus neutralization, without a priori knowledge of the target antigens, using even whole bacteria or parasites. Second, it is well suited to identify antibodies that cross\u2010react with different antigens, since parallel screenings can be performed against multiple targets. Third, it bypasses the need to sequence and express large numbers of antibody sequences since cells of interest are selected based on the initial screenings.",

By screening for the capacity to neutralize the wild\u2010type virus, we isolated antibodies that were 1,000\u2010fold more potent than antibodies to the fusion protein gB and identified their viral target as a pentameric complex formed by gH, gL, pUL128, pUL130 and pUL131A. We then produced a soluble form of this pentamer and found that it can elicit, in mice, neutralizing antibody titres that exceeded by more than 100\u2010fold those induced in humans by natural infection (Kabanova et al, 2014). These studies illustrate a general approach of \u201canalytic vaccinology\u201d where the neutralizing antibodies are used for the identification of the target antigen and for the quality control of the recombinant vaccine.",

            "text": "The interrogation of the memory B\u2010cell repertoire offers the opportunity to investigate, in biologically and medically relevant settings, fundamental aspects of the human immune response, such as the relative contribution of germ line V\u2010gene polymorphism, VDJ junctional diversity and somatic mutations to antigenic specificity. An interesting example comes from the study of antibodies that neutralize group 1 influenza viruses and that are produced by most individuals following infection or vaccination. As reported by several laboratories, these \u201cpublic\u201d antibodies use VH1\u201069 and bind, exclusively through the VH, to a conserved region in the HA stem. By isolating a large number of sister clones and by performing a genealogical analysis of different clonal families, we found that the unmutated common ancestors (UCA) have low affinity for group 1 HA and do not neutralize infection (Fig 1B and C). Remarkably, the first branch points acquire through a single P52aA mutation in HCDR2, high affinity and neutralizing activity, comparable to that of the antibodies isolated from memory B cells that carried up to 15\u201330 amino acid substitution (Pappas et al, 2014). These findings demonstrate that affinity maturation can be achieved rapidly, through a single mutation, and that numerous and redundant somatic mutations continue to accumulate, providing an extensive diversification within the proliferating clone. Interestingly, in these antibodies, a critical contact residue, F54, is germline\u2010encoded, but this position is dimorphic, with different alleles carrying either F or L. Consequently, individuals who lack a F54\u2010encoding allele cannot produce the public VH1\u201069 antibody response, while individuals that have a F54 allele have a high frequency of precursors, with the only additional requirement being a 13\u2010amino acid HCDR3 with a Y98 that makes a critical contact site with the antigen. These findings underline the impact that VH\u2010gene polymorphism can have on the antibody response and suggest that certain alleles may play the role of immune response (Ir) genes and become positively selected in the population exposed to a given pathogen.",

These findings are consistent with a model where pan\u2010influenza neutralizing antibodies arise from the priming of high\u2010affinity precursors by a group 1 virus (in this case H1N1), followed by somatic mutations and generation of a variant with broader reactivity to group 2 viruses that can be boosted by a group 2 virus such as H3N2 (Fig 1D). Importantly, the isolation of cells producing the identical FI6 antibody for 4 consecutive years in response to vaccination or infection indicates that secondary antibody responses are to a large extent independent from germinal centres, a factor that allows the antibody to retain the original specificity. The genealogical analysis of the neutralizing antibody MPE8 revealed a similar mechanism, with the UCA possessing high affinity for RSV only and MPE8 acquiring cross\u2010reactivity to MPV through somatic mutations (Corti et al, 2013).",

Thus, it is tempting to speculate that these autoantibodies may have been generated by somatic mutations in B\u2010cell clones responsive to a foreign antigen in the absence of structural mimicry. Importantly, the mechanisms of deletion or anergy that restrain na\u00efve autoreactive B cells may not apply to activated/memory B cells, which have different triggering requirement and can traffic to peripheral tissues.",

Surprisingly, all the broadly reactive antibodies had a unique structure, since they carried a large insert between the V and the DJ segments. The inserts, of approximately 400 bp, comprised the exon encoding the extracellular domain of the collagen\u2010binding inhibitory receptor LAIR1/CD305, encoded in the leucocyte receptor cluster on Chr. 19 (Tan et al, 2016). Given the insertion between V and DJ, the LAIR1 domain is positioned at the tip of the HCDR3 (Fig 2A and B). The target antigens of LAIR1\u2010containing antibodies were identified in some members of the RIFINs, a family of polymorphic VSAs expressed on the surface of IEs (Fig 2C). Importantly, the inserted LAIR1 domain was both necessary and sufficient for binding to RIFINs, as demonstrated by its insertion into an irrelevant antibody or by the production of LAIR1\u2010Ig fusion proteins.",

This insertion leads, by exon shuffling, to the production of the original antibody and of a bispecific antibody containing the LAIR1 domain precisely placed at the elbow between the VH and CH1 domains (Fig 2A and B).

As exemplified by LAIR1, the insertion of a domain encoding a pathogen receptor can generate public antibodies that are effective against the pathogen. Distinctive advantages of these receptor\u2010based antibodies lie in the broad recognition of all pathogen variants, leaving no room for the selection of escape mutants, and in the possibility of diversifying the receptor domain through somatic mutations to increase binding to pathogen and decrease self\u2010reactivity. The new antibodies are reminiscent of Ehrlich's \u201cside\u2010chain\u201d theory of antibody production, where the antibody was essentially a secreted form of the receptor for the pathogen. We predict that other examples of receptor\u2010based antibodies will be found in response to a variety of human pathogens. Besides LAIR1, other candidates for the generation of receptor\u2010based antibodies to P. falciparum are ICAM1, an adhesion molecule that binds to IEs, and LILRB1, an inhibitory receptor that, like LAIR1, has been shown to bind to RIFINs.
