However, the differentiation of Treg cell was promoted in CIA induced mice injected with PTEN overexpression vector (Fig. 2A). It is well documented that T cell activation is involved in the pathogenesis of RA18. In mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), the alloreactive T cell response was decreased in LBRM transfected with PTEN overexpression compared to that in the control (Fig. 2B). Additionally, PTEN overexpression decreased the number of IL-17 producing CD4+p-STAT705+ or p-STAT727+ T cells. However, the number of CD4+p-Foxp3+ T cells in the spleen tissues of CIA induced mice was significantly upregulated compared to that in the spleen tissues of mice treated with mock vector based on immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C,D).

Cells isolated from WT or p53 deficient mice were cultured under the condition of Th0 or Th17. IL-17 production in p53\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly increased compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 3C,D). Gene expression of IL-17 and CCL20 which causes recruiting of IL\u201317 expressing cells20 in WT mice splenocytes was increased after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6. But, mRNA expression of IL-17 and CCL20 was reduced significantly by p53 activator, nutlin-3a. In contrast, bPV(HOpic), the inhibitor of PTEN, promoted gene expression of IL-17 and CCL20 (Fig. 3E). Gene expression of PTEN was enhanced significantly by nutlin-3a. However, pifithrin-\u03b1, the inhibitor of p53, significantly decreased the mRNA level of PTEN in mice splenocytes (Fig. 3F). These results suggested that the inhibition of p53 under inflammatory milieu of RA might have enhanced inflammation. Additionally, PTEN expression could be regulated by p53 dependent manner.",

To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide evidence that PTEN could be used for RA therapy through regulating Th17/Treg balance. Previously, a number of documents have demonstrated that imbalance between Th17 and Treg can contribute to RA124. Modulation of Th17 and Treg cells has an important role in RA therapy1025. The activation of STAT5 prolongs Foxp3 production in Treg, while STAT3 activation increases the differentiation of Th17 cells26. Moreover, binding of p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 can competitively regulate IL-17 transcription27. Our results demonstrated that Foxp3+ T cells were induced by PTEN overexpression while p53 deficiency significantly induced p-STAT3+ T cells. This could be due to the diminishment of T cell transcriptional regulators such as Foxp3 and SOCS3 and the enhancement of ROR\u03b3t, RUNX1, and BATF. In addition, PTEN decreased the number of Treg cells while Th17 differentiation was promoted in RA mice model. Hence, PTEN might be another efficient mechanism regulated by which p53 through controlling Th17/Treg balance.",
