Human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 circulate in humans and cause mild respiratory diseases [2]. However, the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012 showed that coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and emerge as highly pathogenic viruses [3]. The high fatality rate and wide spread of these new emerging coronaviruses indicate that they are a severe threat to global health.",

            "text": "The spike (S) glycoprotein of the coronavirus is a class I viral fusion protein located on the outer envelope of the virion that plays a critical role in viral infection by recognizing host cell receptors and mediating fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [4]. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor protein consisting of ~1,300 amino acids that is then cleaved into an amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit (~700 amino acids) and a carboxyl (C)-terminal S2 subunit (~600 amino acids). Three S1/S2 heterodimers assemble to form a trimer spike protruding from the viral envelope. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide and two heptad repeat regions. Triggered by receptor binding, proteolytic processing and/or acidic pH in the cellular compartments, the class I viral fusion protein undergoes a transition from a metastable prefusion state to a stable postfusion state during infection, in which the receptor-binding subunit is cleaved, and the fusion subunit undergoes large-scale conformational rearrangements to expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide, induce the formation of a six-helix bundle, and bring the viral and cellular membranes close for fusion [5]. Coronavirus S glycoprotein features two distinct protease cleavage sites. The S1/S2 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is located after residue 667 of the precursor protein, whereas the S2\u2019 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is on the S2 subunit and is 130 amino acids from the N terminus of the S2 subunit [6\u20138]. The S1/S2 cleavage site is located in a flexible loop of residues 660\u2013675 that is completely exposed in the prefusion S1-S2 trimer spike. The S2\u2019 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is completely buried in the prefusion SARS-CoV S glycoprotein [6\u20138]. Cleavage of the S2\u2019 site by host cell proteases is required for successful infection by SARS-CoV [8, 9]. However, the mechanisms involved in exposure and cleavage of the S2\u2019 cleavage site are not well understood. Structural biology studies, especially recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, have advanced our understanding of the role of the coronavirus S glycoprotein in virus entry. S glycoprotein structures in the prefusion state have been reported for members from the Alphacoronavirus genus (HCoV-NL63), Betacoronavirus genus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), Gammacoronavirus genus (IBV), and Deltacoronavirus genus (PdCoV) [7, 10\u201317]. Prefusion S glycoproteins adopt a similar mushroom-like homo-trimer architecture, of which the stem is mainly composed of three S2 subunits, and the top cap consists of three interwoven S1 subunits. A recently reported cryo-EM structure of the MHV S glycoprotein in its postfusion state shows an elongated cone-shaped structure that is significantly different from the prefusion structure and suggests that dramatic conformational changes occur during the prefusion to postfusion transition [18].",

Similar observations of a protruding \u201cup\u201d CTD1 have also been reported for MERS-CoV S glycoproteins [7, 16]. Although crystal structures of CTD1 in complex with ACE2 have been reported [19, 20], the structure of the trimeric coronavirus S glycoprotein in complex with the cellular receptor has not been reported.

The ACE2-bound states showed that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein binds one ACE2 receptor utilizing only the \u201cup\u201d CTD1 (Fig 1, S5 and S6 Figs). The \u201cup\u201d CTD1 and the bound ACE2 are flexible, as shown by a 3D classification analysis that yielded three major ACE2-bound conformational states, in which the \u201cup\u201d CTD1s had different \u201cup\u201d angles (the angle between the long axes of the \u201cup\u201d CTD1 and the horizontal plane) of 51.2\u00b0, 73.3\u00b0 and 111.6\u00b0 (Fig 1A\u20131C). The structure of one of the two ACE2-free states had one CTD1 in the \u201cup\u201d position and was determined at a resolution of 3.9 \u00c5 (Fig 1D). This conformation was designated as the unbound-up conformation, which is ready for receptor binding and represents a receptor-binding active state. The structure of the other ACE2-free state was determined at a resolution of 3.6 \u00c5 with C3 symmetry imposed (Fig 1E). This ACE2-free state had all three CTD1s in the \u201cdown\u201d position and was designated as the unbound-down conformation that is not accessible for receptor binding. We also prepared a complex consisting of ACE2 and the trypsin-cleaved SARS-CoV S glycoprotein without low-pH treatment. Cryo-EM analysis showed similar ACE2-bound, unbound-up and unbound-down conformations (S7 Fig). Collectively, these results showed different conformational states of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and confirmed that the \u201cup\u201d conformation of CTD1 is required for ACE2 binding. Decreasing the pH does not induce significant conformational changes of the S glycoprotein, even after complete cleavage of the precursor S glycoprotein. Interestingly, only one of the three CTD1s in the S glycoprotein was observed in the \u201cup\u201d position in all analyzed structures.",

The CTD2s of the unbound-up and ACE2-bound conformations exhibited a hinge motion away from the spike axis compared to CTD2 in the unbound-down conformation (Fig 2C).

Fitting of the SARS-CoV postfusion S2 trimer model onto the EM map showed good agreement (Fig 3C). The uninterpreted density at one distal end of the dumbbell-shaped density map should be the exposed fusion peptide that is disordered and mediates the aggregation of the postfusion S2 trimers into the rosette-shaped particles.

The elution position of the peak indicated a protein or protein complex with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. Subsequent biochemical and cryo-EM analyses of the peak showed a complex of one S1 subunit monomer and one ACE2 molecule (Fig 4B\u20134D, S10 Fig), suggesting that binding of ACE2 to the S glycoprotein could trigger the dissociation of one S1 from the trimer together with ACE2. Analysis of the S trimer structure in the prefusion state showed that the \u201cC\u201d-shaped loop (residues 787\u2013796) covering the S2\u2019 cleavage site was clipped by the linker downstream of the S1/S2 cleavage site of an adjacent protomer (Fig 4E). Disassociation of one S1-ACE2 complex from the spike would release the clipping linker and could induce conformational changes of the \u201cC\u201d-shaped loop, exposing the S2\u2019 site for protease cleavage and promoting the formation of a postfusion S2 trimer (Fig 4E). Of note, we observed a similar size-exclusion chromatography profile and rosette-shaped particles in the EM image of the complex consisting of ACE2 and the trypsin-cleaved S glycoprotein without low-pH treatment (S11 Fig). This finding indicates that low-pH treatment of the cleaved S glycoprotein is not required for the disassociation of S1-ACE2 or for the formation of rosette-shaped particles of the postfusion S2 trimer. We also incubated the S glycoprotein with ACE2 first and then used low-pH buffer and trypsin to treat the sample. Size-exclusion chromatography analysis of the sample showed a similar elution profile with four peaks consisting of S2, S-ACE2, S1-ACE2 and excess ACE2, respectively (S12 Fig).",

Unlike the S glycoproteins of MERS-CoV and MHV, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is not cleaved at the S1/S2 site during virus packaging in cells and, hence, remains uncleaved on mature virions [22, 23]. However, cleavage of the precursor S protein at the S1/S2 cleavage site by extracellular or endosome proteases is required for a functional SARS-CoV S glycoprotein [24]. Previous studies showed that blockage of the pH decrease in endosomes slightly reduced SARS-CoV infection, which indicated that low pH is not an essential factor for virus entry [25, 26]. Here, our results showed that the prefusion architecture, either in the unbound or ACE2-bound state, was retained in the cleaved S glycoprotein, and the conformational heterogeneity of CTD1s still existed. Similar results were also obtained for the cleaved with/without low-pH treatment S glycoproteins. Therefore, although cleavage at the S1/S2 site is required for a functional S glycoprotein, it does not significantly affect the overall architecture and conformation heterogeneity. However, we did observe significant differences between the mutant and wild-type cleaved S glycoproteins in binding ACE2, indicating that the S1/S2 cleavage site might affect CTD1 receptor binding, although the mechanism is still under investigation.",

Our complex structures confirmed that the conformational switch of CTD1 from the \u201cdown\u201d to \u201cup\u201d position is a prerequisite for receptor binding. Structural comparisons showed that binding of the receptor further opens CTD1. In addition, observations of the S1-ACE2 complex and the postfusion S2 assembly in the receptor-present sample suggested that receptor binding can open one CTD1 and trigger the release of all the S1 subunits from the spike. We did not observe S glycoprotein particles with two remaining S1 subunits in any sample, which suggests that disassociation of one S1-ACE2 from the S trimer could cause sequential disassociation of the S1 subunits from the spike trimer. A similar disassociation of the S1 subunits from the spike was also observed for MERS-CoV, even without binding the receptor [7, 16]. Although the virus uses a similar CTD1 \u201cup\u201d mechanism for receptor binding, the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein, which can have all three CTD1s of a trimer spike in the \u201cup\u201d conformation, is significantly different from the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, in which only one \u201cup\u201d CTD1 was observed. In addition, disassociated trimeric S1 particles were observed for MERS-CoV [16], suggesting simultaneous disassociation of all three S1 subunits from the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. Structural modeling showed that sufficient space exists for the other two CTD1s in the \u201cdown\u201d position to point \u201cup\u201d and to bind with ACE2 for most of the S-ACE2 complexes (S13 Fig). However, we did not observe more than one ACE2 or more than one \u201cup\u201d CTD1 in one spike. We speculate that a conformational switch producing more than one \u201cup\u201d CTD1 may destabilize the cleaved S glycoprotein and trigger immediate disassociation of the S1 subunits and the S1-ACE2 complex. Additionally, disassociation of the SARS-CoV S1 subunit should be receptor binding-dependent, since no free S1 was observed when ACE2 was missing.",

The postfusion S2 subunits are a six-helix bundle with a 160 \u00c5-long central helix core. The pre- to postfusion transition of the S2 subunits requires a 180\u00b0 flip of prefusion helix fragments H1 (residues 902\u2013920) and H2 (residues 928\u2013948) that fuse with helix fragment H3 (residues 970\u20131015) to form the postfusion central helix core. Helix linker 2 is critical for the formation of the postfusion helix core, as has been shown in a previous study, which indicated that substitution of the residues in this region with prolines retains the S glycoprotein in the prefusion conformation and prevents conformational rearrangement [7]. The \u201cdown\u201d CTD1s are located immediately above the S2 subunits and have direct contact with helix linker 2 (Fig 5, left). The direct contact should stabilize the prefusion S2 subunit and prevent it from transitioning into the postfusion state. Opening of CTD1, especially by binding the receptor, would remove the steric restraints on helix linker 2, triggering the release of the S1 subunits and probably simultaneously allowing the extension of prefusion S2 helixes to form the postfusion S2 long helix bundle (Fig 5).",

Fitting of the atomic models to the cryo-EM densities was performed by maximizing the density value around the fitted atoms [37]. The separately fitted models were combined to yield a complete model. The model was then refined using PHENIX real-space refinement with secondary structure restraints and geometry restraints and adjusted in COOT. CTD1 was defined as a rigid body during the refinement. The models of the ACE2-S complex were generated in a manner similar to that used for the unbound-up S glycoprotein model. The crystal structure of the CTD1-S complex (PDB ID: 2ajf) was used to build the initial model by fitting the structure as a rigid body into the EM density.
