            "text": "Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection, caused mainly by Bordetella pertussis and less frequently by Bordetella parapertussis [1]. In the pre-vaccination era, infants and children contracted pertussis in their first years of life, with a clinical course characterized by uncontrollable coughing attacks, often accompanied by paroxysms, post-tussive vomiting, and inspiratory whooping. Consistently high vaccination coverage has substantially decreased pertussis in the population [2, 3], but newborns too young to be vaccinated remain at high risk for severe complications including apnea, cyanosis, pneumonia, encephalopathy or even death [4]. This risk is increasing due to the worldwide pertussis reemergence in the 1990s, even in areas of high vaccination coverage in all age groups, with transmission of disease from household members to newborns. Today, high pertussis incidences in infants are observed, with incidence peaking every two to three years [3, 5, 6]. Worldwide in 2014, an estimated 24 million cases and 160,000 deaths from pertussis occurred in children younger than 5 years, with the African region contributing the greatest share [7]. In the Netherlands, each year approximately 150\u2013180 children <2y are hospitalized and one infant, in general too young to be vaccinated, dies due to pertussis [8]. For this reason, many countries are discussing prenatal pertussis vaccination of mothers to protect newborns, and a growing number of countries now recommend it [9]. This measure is effective in preventing pertussis in the first months of life and has decreased the pertussis disease burden in young infants [10, 11]. In the Netherlands, the Health Council advised that 3rd trimester maternal pertussis vaccination be offered. This is overall very effective in prevention of pertussis in early infancy, but preterms may benefit less due to a smaller time-window for mother-to-child transfer of antibodies before delivery [12, 13]. However, vaccine effectiveness (VE) is reportedly lower after 2nd trimester pertussis vaccination [14]. Given the introduction of a maternal vaccination strategy against pertussis in The Netherlands, we sought to gain more insight into the current pertussis burden among hospitalized infants, with special attention to preterms.",

In Switzerland, hospitalized infants < 6 m of age had higher frequencies of coughing attacks (93%), whooping (69%), vomiting (59%) and complications (24%) [28, 29]. As active designs usually profit from more structured clinical observations and documentation in the medical record, the frequencies found in retrospective studies probably underestimate the pertussis burden in terms and preterms [30].",

Likewise, studies have shown a decreased immune response after immunization at 2 months in preterms compared with terms [38, 39] while finding an equal response at 3 months [40]. The fact that the Scandinavian countries saw no difference in VE between term and preterms might be explained by the interplay between maternal antibodies that reduce a first response and an immune response that is ineffective in preterms at age 2 months but may have improved by age 3 months [41]. For the 2nd dose, we found no VE difference between terms and preterms.",

Results might have been influenced by the incomplete reporting of hospital diagnoses at discharge, assessed in a recent capture-recapture analysis [8]. We could not stratify this underreporting by GA, but the good representation of tertiary, top clinical, and local hospitals in our study probably led to inclusion of a representative variety in the spectrum of pertussis disease.

While this strategy is overall very effective, preterms may benefit less due to less protective maternal antibody transfer before delivery [12, 13]. They probably will benefit more from 2nd trimester immunization. Especially for infants born of unvaccinated mothers, a timely first post-natal dose remains important, as it greatly reduces cases of pertussis and decreases disease severity. Our study underlines the need for more in-depth surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases in relation to GA and more insight into optimizing the vaccination program for all children but in particular for preterms, the most vulnerable group.",
