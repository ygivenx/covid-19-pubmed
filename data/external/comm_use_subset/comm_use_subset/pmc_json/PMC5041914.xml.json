XB130 protein expression was not associated with the postoperative prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [11]. By contrary, XB130 expression was an independent prognostic factor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [12]. In gastric cancer, reduced XB130 protein expression is a prognostic biomarker for shorter survival and a higher recurrence rate [13]. On the other hand, in human ductal breast cancer, XB130 was present in the cytoplasm of malignant cells, but not in the normal breast cells, and positive XB130 expression was an independent risk factor for overall survival and recurrence free survival [14]. XB130, thus, may play different role in tumorigenesis depending upon the types of cancers.",

Recently, there is a report that translocation of XB130 from cytoplasm to micro-filamentous structure is involved in NNK (a cigarette smoking component) induced migration of normal human bronchial epithelial cells [8]. Moreover, the interaction between XB130 and another adaptor protein, Tks5, mediates EGF and serum-induced proliferation and survival of human bronchial epithelial cells [15]. To determine the physiological function and tumorigenesis of XB130 in vivo, XB130 knockout (KO) mice have been generated. XB130 deficiency could slow down the differentiation of proliferating basal cells to ciliated epithelial cells during the repair process in trachea [16]. XB130 also promotes bronchioalveolar stem cell and Club cell proliferation in small airway repair and regeneration [17]. The objective of the present study is to determine the role of XB130 in septic response and acute lung injury.",

To determine if XB130 plays a role in systemic septic response, we challenged animals with LPS intraperitoneally. We observed significant differences between Xb130 KO and WT mice, in terms of body weight loss and composite disease score after LPS treatment. Moreover, the serum levels of several cytokines at Day 2 of LPS treatment were significantly higher in Xb130 KO mice. MCP-1 is a CC chemokine for the recruitment of monocytes and other inflammatory cells to the sites of tissue injury and infection [23, 24]. The pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) can activate neutrophils, which adhere to the affected capillary endothelium and migrate into air spaces, leading to severe lung injury [25, 26]. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays protective roles in controlling immunopathology during ALI [27, 28]. The expression of IL-10 can be rapidly induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 [27, 28]. In this study, the levels of these cytokines in serum increased at 2 and 6 hours after LPS treatment in both groups, and then decreased in WT mice at Day 2, but remained significantly higher in the Xb130 KO mice. The XB130 deficiency may not affect LPS challenge-induced rapid systemic inflammatory response, but may delay the recovery. At Day 2, the histology of spleen, kidney and liver appeared relatively normal, which may be due to the recovery of these critical organs from LPS challenge. The gene expression of XB130 is relatively higher in the spleen [6], which is important for immunological response. However, we did not see morphological differences between KO and WT in the spleen, kidney and liver. Therefore, why serum cytokine levels in KO mice remaining high should be further studied.",

In the present study, severe lung injury with more apoptotic cells, and higher W/D weight ratio and less cell proliferation were observed in Xb130 KO mice at Day 2 after LPS treatment. Cell death and inflammation may contribute to increased vascular permeability and tissue damage [29, 30]. Xb130, as an upstream regulator of PI3K/Akt pathway, specifically binds p85\u03b1 subunit of PI3K and leads to its activation [6]. Knocking down Xb130 with siRNA in thyroid or lung cancer cells reduced cell survival, increased susceptibilities of cells to extrinsic and intrinsic signal-induced cell death, which was associated with increased cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9. Down-regulation of XB130 also reduced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, together with reduced phosphorylation of p21, p27, GSK-3\u03b2 and FOXO3\u03b1 [3, 7, 31]. XB130 is also required for cAMP-induced amplification of IGF related mitogenicity in thyroid cells [9]. We did not specify the cell types that undergoing apoptosis or proliferation, however, we did show expression of XB130 in the alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, we would like to propose that the lack of XB130 in lung epithelial cells may contribute to apoptotic cell death in the lung after LPS stimulation, and subsequently increase the pulmonary permeability and edema. The reduced cell proliferation may explain the delayed repair of lung epithelium.",

The staining of these proteins was very weak on the alveolar wall in both WT and KO animals (data not shown). After LPS treatment, Xb130 mRNA level was significantly reduced in the lung of WT mice, and the staining for XB130 was also extremely weak in alveolar cells. LPS and TNF-\u03b1 treatment reduced XB130 protein level in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (unpublished data); LPS may inhibit XB130 expression and reduce the protective effects of XB130 in ALI. This may also explain the weak staining of phosphorylation of p85\u03b1 and Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 on alveolar wall.",

GSK-3\u03b2 is a serine threonine protein kinase, and a downstream target of PI3K/Akt pathway. Human monocytes stimulated with E. coli LPS demonstrated increased Ser 9 phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 [32]. The higher numbers of p-GSK-3\u03b2 positive macrophages and neutrophils may be due to prolonged injury and delayed the repair of lung epithelial cells. The accumulation of macrophages in the lung tissue in Xb130 KO mice may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALI [33\u201335].",

Its deficiency reduces cell survival, promotes the infiltration of inflammatory cells into alveoli, increases pulmonary permeability, reduces cell proliferation, and slows down the repair process. XB130 expression can be inhibited by LPS challenge. Other ALI animal models should be used to further explore the roles of XB130. Moreover, the role of XB130 should be addressed directly in human ALI.",
