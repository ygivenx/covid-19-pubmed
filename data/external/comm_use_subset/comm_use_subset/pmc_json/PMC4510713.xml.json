For residues 83\u2013290, homology modelling predicted a GDSL/SGNH-like \u03b1/\u03b2-fold that forms the scaffold for a catalytic triad composed of S94, D270 and H273, with S94 as part of a conserved GDS sequence motif (Fig. 1a). The acronyms of the family name GDSL/SGNH reflect the presence of four invariant residues, namely S in a GDS(L) motif, G located after strand S2, N placed in a GxND motif after strand S3 and H found in a DxxH motif N-terminal to the last helix38. However, the N-terminal domain of CASD1 differs from the canonical GDSL/SGNH fold by lacking the conserved residues G and N, and is therefore grouped into pfam family PF13839 (GDSL/SGNH-like acyl-esterase family found in Pmr5 and Cas1p)39.",

The orientation of the epitope tags was determined by selective membrane permeabilization and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1b,c). Under conditions that allowed antibody access to all cellular compartments (0.2% Triton X-100), both tags were detectable and showed co-localization with the Golgi marker \u03b1-mannosidase II (\u03b1-Man II). Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with low concentrations of digitonin (5 \u03bcg ml\u22121) allowed visualization of the N-terminal V5-tag, but not the C-terminal Myc-tag, demonstrating cytosolic and luminal orientation of N- and C-terminus, respectively. The integrity of the Golgi membrane was demonstrated by parallel staining with an antibody specific for the luminal domain of \u03b1-Man II40. Staining was observed exclusively in Triton X-100, but not in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Identical results were obtained on staining with an antibody against the SGNH-like domain of CASD1 (pAb 500), demonstrating that this domain faces the Golgi lumen (Fig. 1c). On the basis of these results and on our predictions for the CASD1 transmembrane domains (Supplementary Fig. 1), we propose a topology model encompassing a luminal catalytic domain flanked by one N-terminal and 12 C-terminal transmembrane domains (Fig. 1a).",

            "text": "To analyse the enzymatic activity of CASD1 in vitro, we generated a construct that allowed the expression of a soluble secreted form of CASD1 (termed sCASD1), which encompassed the SGNH-like luminal domain and a C-terminal Myc-His6-tag (Fig. 2a\u2013c). This form was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, either as wild-type variant (sCASD1-wt) or as active site serine mutant (sCASD1-S94A). Affinity purified proteins were then used as an enzyme source for in vitro assays. First, we analysed whether sCASD1 possesses esterase activity, since the GDSL/SGNH fold is usually found among hydrolytic enzymes38, including the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase domains of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of influenza C and bovine coronavirus (BCoV)414243. However, under conditions that displayed high O-acetyltransferase activity for BCoV-HE, no activity was observed for sCASD1-wt, neither towards the synthetic acetylesterase substrate para-nitrophenylacetate (pNP-acetate; Fig. 2d) nor towards natural O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates (not shown). Thus, while the N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 displays the characteristic fold of an esterase39, it does not appear to function as such. We therefore tested whether sCASD1 might catalyse the reverse reaction and act as a SOAT. Indeed, in the presence of [3H]acetyl-CoA, sCASD1-wt showed acetyltransferase activity, resulting in the formation of radiolabelled protein, even in the absence of acceptor substrates (Fig. 2e). No radioactive incorporation was seen in parallel experiments with the mutant sCASD1-S94A, demonstrating that the observed acetyl transfer was enzyme catalysed. SOAT activity of sCASD1 towards its own N-glycans was improbable. Although sCASD1 is N-glycosylated (Fig. 2c), glycoproteins that are produced in Sf9 cells typically bear pauci mannosidic N-glycans lacking penultimate galactose and terminal Sia residues44. Consequently, we asked whether sCASD1 can catalyse the formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate that could be trapped in the absence of acceptor substrate. Therefore, purified sCASD1 was incubated in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA, digested with trypsin and analysed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). After incubation of sCASD1-wt with acetyl-CoA, the peptide containing the active site residue S94 (87-HIAFIGDSR-95) occurred as a mixed population of unmodified and modified peptide with a mass shift of 42 Da (shift by m/z=21 for the doubly charged ion), consistent with the formation of an acetyl adduct (Fig. 2f; note that the sequence of the peptides was confirmed by tandem MS/MS; see Supplementary Fig. 2). Analysis of the peak areas in the extracted ion chromatograms revealed that about 19% of the peptide population was acetylated (Supplementary Fig. 3). In parallel experiments with sCASD1-S94A, only the respective unmodified peptide (87-HIAFIGDAR-95) was found (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Figs 2 and 3), indicating that the hydroxyl group of S94 serves as attachment site for the acetyl group.",

After the reaction, Sia was released by acidic hydrolysis to allow derivatization with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxy-benzene (DMB) at the free reducing end. The obtained fluorescent Sia derivatives were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Fig. 3a-e). SOAT activity was clearly detected towards CMP-Neu5Ac (as indicated by an additional peak in the HPLC profile, which eluted at the same retention time as DMB-derivatized 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac2) of the reference panel; see Fig. 3a,c). The additional peak was not detected in samples obtained from parallel reactions without enzyme (Fig. 3b) or from reactions with sCASD1-S94A (Fig. 3d). Compared with free Neu5Ac or sialoglycoconjugates, CMP-Neu5Ac was by far the best acceptor substrate (Fig. 3e). The identity of the product peak obtained with CMP-Neu5Ac was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, which showed the expected parent ion mass of DMB-labelled mono-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and a fragmentation pattern characteristic for DMB-Neu5,9Ac2 (ref. 45; Fig. 3f,g). Together, these data demonstrate that the isolated SGNH-like domain of CASD1 displays SOAT activity in vitro and transfers acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to CMP-Neu5Ac, resulting in the formation of CMP-Neu5,9Ac2.",

As a detection tool, we made use of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of BCoV. BCoV uses 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans as host cell receptors and the HE contains both a lectin domain and a receptor-destroying sialate 9-O-acetylesterase domain4246. Inactivation of the esterase activity by S40A mutation (HE0) and fusion to the Fc part of human IgG gave rise to a soluble virolectin (BCoV-HE0-Fc) that selectively recognizes 9-O-acetylated Sias42, as confirmed by glycan array screening47. Immunofluorescence analysis with BCoV-HE0-Fc revealed that several mammalian cell lines express 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes exclusively in the Golgi apparatus (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the underlying carrier structures were N- and O-glycans, since blocking O-glycosylation sufficiently abrogated 9-O-acetylation only in cells that additionally lacked complex and hybrid N-glycans (Supplementary Fig. 5).",

In fact, we found only a single cell line, the murine fibroblast cell line LM-TK\u2212, that was devoid of both (Supplementary Fig. 4). Transfection of this naturally occurring O-Ac-negative cell line with CASD1 complementary DNA (cDNA), but not empty vector, led to the formation of Golgi-resident 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes as shown by virolectin staining (Fig. 4a). De-O-acetylation, by either alkali treatment or the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase activity of BCoV-HE, completely abolished the virolectin signals and was used as specificity control (Fig. 4a). After stable expression of wild-type CASD1, 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes were detected in all cells and co-localized with the Golgi marker \u03b1-Man II and Golgi-localized V5-tagged CASD1 (Fig. 4b). Introduction of the S94A exchange into full-length CASD1 (CASD1-S94A) resulted in a loss of function. Although the mutant protein was expressed and localized to the Golgi, virolectin staining was seen only in <1% of the cells (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that CASD1 mediates sialate 9-O-acetylation in LM-TK\u2212 cells and that this function is impaired by alanine exchange of S94.",

The obtained knockout cell line (HAP1\u0394CASD1) harbours a 16-bp frame shift mutation in exon 3 of CASD1, allowing only the production of a truncated polypeptide that already lacks S94, the most N-terminally located residue of the catalytic triad (Fig. 5a-c). Whereas parental HAP1 cells expressed 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans in the Golgi apparatus, 9-O-acetylation was completely lost in HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells (Fig. 5d). This was further confirmed by DMB-HPLC analysis revealing the presence of DMB-derivatized Neu5,9Ac2 in parental but not in HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). Transfection with CASD1 cDNA, but not empty vector, resulted in successful complementation of the loss-of-function defect and restored 9-O-acetylation of Golgi-localized sialoglycotopes (Fig. 5e). Of note, a genetic knockout carried out in parallel in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells showed the same outcome (Supplementary Fig. 7) and thus provided independent evidence for the essential role of CASD1 in Sia 9-O-acetylation.",

To do so, we made use of a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that distinguish between GD3 (CD60a) and 9-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60b). HAP1 cells lack GD3 but can generate the disialo ganglioside after expression of the sialyltransferase ST8Sia I (Fig. 6a; mAb R24). ST8Sia I converts GM3 to GD3 by adding an \u03b12,8-linked Sia residue, which in turn can carry an O-acetyl group in C9 position (Fig. 6c)49. In HAP1 wild-type cells, expression of ST8Sia I resulted in the formation of both CD60a and CD60b antigens, as shown by additional staining with mAb UM4D4 (Fig. 6a). As described for other anti-CD60b antibodies, UM4D4 recognizes 9-O-acetylated GD3 and similar gangliosides possessing a terminal 9-O-acetylated disialo group such as 9-O-acetylated disialo neolactotetraosylceramide and 9-O-acetylated disialo neolactohexaosylceramide (see Supplementary Fig. 8c for details on ganglioside structures)50. However, binding of mAb UM4D4 strictly relies on the O-acetylation of the carbohydrate epitope and no cross-reactivity towards the unmodified epitope is seen (see refs 50, 51 and Supplementary Fig. 8b). Newly synthesized CD60a and CD60b epitopes were both detected at the cell surface, as demonstrated by respective signals on non-permeabilized cells. In HAP1\u0394CASD1 cells, expression of ST8Sia I alone led to the formation of GD3 (Fig. 6b; mAb R24) but not 9-O-Ac-GD3 or other 9-O-acetylated gangliosides of the neolacto series (Fig. 6b; mAb UM4D4). Ganglioside modification was only detected after co-expression of ST8Sia I with CASD1, demonstrating that CASD1 is crucial for the formation of 9-O-acetylated CD60b epitopes (Fig. 6b; middle images). Again, alanine exchange of the active site residue S94 drastically impaired CASD1 function (Fig. 6b; right images).",

This phenomenon, described only by one previous study37, highlights that 9-O-acetylation is much more common than anticipated from cell surface staining. The finding that Golgi-confined 9-O-acetylated Sias were attached to N- and O-glycans suggests Golgi-resident glycoproteins as underlying carriers and interestingly, 9-O-acetylated Sia was recently found on the N-glycans of a human sialyltransferase52.",

This indicates that parental HAP1 cells lack detectable cell surface 9-O-acetylation, because cell surface sialoglycotopes amenable to 9-O-acetylation are either absent or present in very low quantities. Regulation of cell surface 9-O-acetylation by the action of specific sialyltransferases is consistent with data from CHO cells, showing that cell surface 9-O-acetylation could be induced by ST8Sia I or ST6Gal I, two sialyltransferases that are normally not expressed in CHO cells53.",

Although the situation may be more complex in vivo, this result suggests that CASD1 may not directly 9-O-acetylate sialoglycoconjugates, but instead provides 9-O-acetylated CMP-Neu5Ac (CMP-Neu5,9Ac2) for sialyltransferases. In this scenario, the sialyltransferases would play a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates that carry 9-O-acetylated Sia. In support of this, CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 was detected in bovine submandibular glands54 and biochemical data obtained with human colon mucosa showed a Golgi-associated SOAT activity that utilized CMP-Neu5Ac as acceptor and a sialyltransferase activity that transferred 9-O-acetylated Sia from CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 to endogenous and exogenous acceptors3355. Moreover, the use of CMP-Neu5,9Ac2 has been shown for several sialyltransferases and is exploited for chemo-enzymatic synthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialosides56.

Even under physiological conditions, O-acetyl groups at the Sia side chain can spontaneously migrate from C7 and C8 to an unsubstituted hydroxyl group at position C9, where the O-acetyl group is more stable5758. Moreover, 7-O-Ac-specific SOAT activity has been detected in several tissues315960 and studies on microsomal fractions from bovine submandibular glands provided evidence for an enzyme that accelerates the migration of O-acetyl groups from C7 to C9 in vivo59. In line with previous studies on 7-O-Ac-specific SOAT activity, Arming et al.35 observed a role of CASD1 in 7-O-acetylation but not in 9-O-acetylation of GD3 as shown by FACS analysis with anti-CD60c and anti-CD60b mAbs35. The stability of O-acetyl groups at C7 might thus be cell-type-specific and could explain the discrepancy with our data.",

Transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to a serine placed in a Ser\u2013His\u2013Asp catalytic triad is reminiscent of what we found for the polysialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferase OatC of Neisseria meningitidis61 and suggests a ping\u2013pong mechanism as described for other members of the SGNH-hydrolase family6263. Consistently, we propose a mechanism in which the catalytic triad of CASD1 forms a charge relay network to activate S94, allowing nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl donor. This leads to the transfer of the acetyl group to S94, followed by transfer to CMP-Neu5Ac during the second half reaction. Alanine exchange of S94 in sCASD1 prevented the formation of the acetyl-enzyme intermediate and resulted in a complete loss of SOAT activity in vitro.",

Detection of residual virolectin staining in cells expressing full-length CASD1-S94A may indicate that the C-terminal part contributes to CASD1 activity in vivo. First indication for this scenario is given by a bioinformatics analysis of the cryptococcal Cas1 protein (Cas1p)39. This study highlighted that the multi-TM domain found in Cas1p and its animal orthologue CASD1 shares homology with bacterial multi-TM O-acetyltransferases that are involved in the modification of cell surface or periplasmic biopolymers such as polysaccharides and peptidoglycan39. Of note, several of the bacterial multi-TM proteins work in concert with an SGNH-like O-acetyltransferase, with the latter being expressed either as separate protein or fused to the multi-TM part as in CASD1 (refs 62, 64, 65).",

Purified sCASD1-wt was analysed before (0 h) and after partial (0.5\u20133 h) or complete (18 h) Peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) digest by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and western blotting using an anti-Myc mAb. Partial removal of N-glycans by PNGaseF resulted in five bands with reduced molecular mass, indicating the presence of five N-glycans. (d) Potential esterase activity of sCASD1-wt was monitored using the acetylesterase substrate pNP-acetate. BCoV-HE-Fc harbouring an active esterase domain was used as positive control and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as negative control (mean\u00b1s.d., n=3 experiments). (e) Formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate monitored by radioactive incorporation. Purified sCASD1-wt and sCASD1-S94A were incubated with [3H]acetyl-CoA and the radioactivity incorporated into protein was measured by scintillation counting. BSA was used as negative control (mean\u00b1s.d., n=4 experiments). (f) Verification of the acetyl-enzyme intermediate by mass spectrometry. Purified sCASD1-wt and sCASD1-S94A were incubated with or without acetyl-CoA. After separation by SDS\u2013PAGE and tryptic digestion of the excised protein bands, each sample was analysed by LC-ESI-MS. Theoretical m/z values are given for the twofold charged tryptic peptides containing the active site serine S94 or the corresponding S94A mutation. Spectra were acquired by accumulating scans within\u00b10.1 min around the respective peak maxima in the extracted ion chromatograms of the given m/z values (Supplementary Fig. 3). The identity of each peptide variant was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS/MS (Supplementary Fig. 2). Please see Supplementary Figs 9 and 10 for uncropped versions of gel and blot shown in b and of the blot shown in c, respectively.",

Asterisks denote that the indicated Sia species are labelled with DMB. (b-d) HPLC elution profiles of DMB-derivatized samples obtained after incubation of CMP-Neu5Ac and acetyl-CoA without enzyme (b), with sCASD1-wt (c) or with sCASD1-S94A (d). In all profiles, the retention time corresponding to DMB-Neu5,9Ac2 of the reference panel is highlighted by a grey box. (e) SOAT activity of sCASD1 towards different acceptor substrates. Purified sCASD1-wt and sCASD1-S94A were incubated with acetyl-CoA and the indicated acceptor substrates. Product analysis was performed by DMB-HPLC analysis and the amount of DMB-Neu5,9Ac2 was quantified by integrating the corresponding peak areas. Parallel HPLC runs of reactions without CASD1 were used to measure the background, and data are presented as background subtracted data with the values obtained for CMP-Neu5Ac in the presence of sCASD1-wt and acetyl-CoA set to 100% (mean\u00b1s.d., n=3). (f) Scheme showing sCASD1-catalysed 9-O-acetylation of CMP-Neu5Ac, subsequent DMB labelling of the reaction product, and the calculated m/z value ([M+H]+) for DMB-derivatized Neu5,9Ac2.
