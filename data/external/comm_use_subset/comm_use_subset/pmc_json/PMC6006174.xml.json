Asthma and COPD are severe and disabling diseases of the respiratory tract and hence represent a serious global health problem affecting different age groups. Acute pre-school wheeze and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are other common causes of emergency visits with possible viral etiology. There is an increasing prevalence of these airways diseases, rising treatment costs, and therefore virus-induced respiratory illnesses are a heavy burden for patients and the community4,5. Respiratory viral infections, mainly due to rhinovirus (RV), are responsible for approximately 80% of wheeze and asthma exacerbations in children6,7. Moreover, infants with rhinovirus-induced wheeze have a significantly increased risk for subsequent development of recurrent wheeze and childhood asthma8. Since exposure to RV does not lead to wheezing illness in all children, additional factors such as the host genotype, defects of the respiratory epithelial barrier, and/or atopic predisposition have been suggested to play important roles in asthma9\u201311.",

In fact, there are also several preventive and therapeutic strategies for RV infections under development which require a precise knowledge of the clinically relevant RV species to be targeted. For example, several approaches for developing vaccines based on polyvalent inactivated RV, synthetic RV-derived peptides and recombinant RV proteins have been reported20\u201325. The formulation of a broadly protective vaccine obviously requires the inclusion of the clinically most relevant and common RV species. Furthermore, it has been shown that blocking of the viral receptor on respiratory epithelial cells (e.g., ICAM-1) can prevent RV infection26. Again therapeutic approaches targeting the viral receptors require knowledge which RV species are the most frequent and relevant ones. Finally, it is important to investigate the role of the different RV species for exacerbations of severe bronchial obstruction in different populations and for different age groups and manifestations of respiratory illness (e.g., pre-school wheeze, asthma, COPD, asthma-COPD overlap: ACO, CAP). While RV is well established as an important trigger factor for childhood wheeze and asthma, less is known regarding the role of RV infections in exacerbations of COPD and in respiratory disease exacerbations of older subjects3. Furthermore, the causal relationship of RV with CAP is also unknown27.",

            "text": "Currently, the detection of RV in the course of respiratory infections is mainly based on reverse transcription of viral RNA and DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)28. Such tests can demonstrate the presence of virus-derived nucleic acid but they do not necessarily indicate that the particular virus had caused an infection and is indeed responsible for clinical symptoms in the patient29. In fact, rhinovirus RNA has been found in a high proportion of asymptomatic infants and children30\u201332. Furthermore, little is known about levels and epitope-specificities of natural antibody responses capable of neutralizing rhinoviruses, and thus protecting individuals against RV infections. Such information would be helpful for the development of new immunological strategies for the treatment and prevention of RV-induced exacerbations of respiratory diseases. Therefore, there is a huge and so far unmet need for high-resolution serological detection of rhinovirus infections. We have previously identified the capsid protein VP1 and an N-terminal VP1 peptide as major target for the natural antibody response of RV-infected subjects33. Then we have demonstrated that in vivo inoculation of subjects with RV16 indeed induced increases of VP1-specific antibody responses which were best detected with the VP1 protein of the corresponding species33. Similar increases of RV-specific antibodies were found in pre-school children after asthma attacks using complete recombinant RV capsid proteins34. In a recent study performed in pre-school children with acute asthma attacks, we observed that increases of RV-specific antibody responses reflected the severity of respiratory symptoms35.",

Recombinant capsid proteins (VP1-VP4) and fragments thereof representing RV-A, B, C species as well as non-structural proteins from RV89 were included (Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). Based on our previous finding that antibodies from RV-infected patients react preferentially with the N-terminus of VP1 (ref. 33), we included synthetic N-terminal VP1 peptides from 30 RV strains which were selected in a rational, multistep process to represent distinct RV strains (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 2). Starting with 107 VP1 sequences retrieved from the NCBI database (RV-A: 76; RV-B: 25; RV-C: 6), multiple sequence alignments were performed to identify clusters of peptides with high degrees of sequence identities (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 2: Clusters A1\u2013A17; B1\u2013B9; C1\u2013C3). In a next step, peptides were re-clustered into groups taking the chemical properties of amino acids into consideration (Supplementary Table 2: AI\u2013AXVIII; BI\u2013BIX; CI\u2013CIII). From these groups 30 peptides with the most distantly related sequences were selected (Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). For a further refinement of VP1, VP2, and VP3 antibody responses, VP2 and VP3 fragments as well as peptides spanning the complete VP1 sequence from RV89 were included (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). For control and calibration purposes we added recombinant allergens and control proteins (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 6) to the PreDicta chip.",

Figure 2a, b show the frequency and intensity of IgG and IgA antibody reactivity of the children to the 30 N-terminal VP1 peptides representing RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C species. The most frequent and highest IgG responses were directed to RV-C-derived peptides followed by RV-A peptides whereas IgG reactivity to RV-B peptides was less frequent and intense (Fig. 2a). Similar results were obtained for IgA responses which in general were lower than the IgG responses (Fig. 2b). The analysis of IgG reactivity to structural and non-structural proteins and to recombinant fragments and synthetic peptides spanning VP1, VP2, and VP3 from RV89 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a for all 120 children and in Supplementary Fig. 2b for those children (n = 41) who had shown increases of RV89-specific antibody responses in follow-up serum samples taken after recovery. Results obtained thus confirmed our earlier observations showing that the majority of RV-specific antibody responses are directed against the N-terminus of VP1 as represented by the 30 peptides from the N-terminus of VP1 proteins from the different RV species33. Some children showed an IgG response against VP2 and in particular to a fragment representing the middle portion of VP2 whereas VP3 and VP4 showed no relevant IgG reactivity (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Among the non-structural proteins, 2C, 3A, and 3C showed some IgG reactivity (Supplementary Fig. 2).",

Supplementary Figure 5 shows a color-coded map of the peptide-specific antibody responses for the acute phase and follow-up of each of the children demonstrating species-specific IgG increases. Next, we compared the peptide-specific increases in relative numbers for each child (Fig. 3a). According to these peptide-specific IgG increases, children could be identified who responded preferentially to RV-A-derived peptides (n = 41), RV-C-derived peptides (n = 33), RV-B-derived peptides (n = 23), and some with a mixed response pattern (n = 7) (Fig. 3a). For 16 children no increases of peptide-specific IgG responses were found (Fig. 3a, bottom). The same analysis was performed for increases of antibody responses against complete recombinant VP1 proteins from the three RV-A strains (i.e., RV89, 16, 2), the RV-C strain YP, and the RV-B strain 14 (Fig. 3a) but the results were less clear and negative for several children because only few strains were covered with the recombinant proteins. We have also included in Fig. 3a (right column) results from the PCR testing performed using VP4\u2013VP2-specific primers in 108 of the 120 children35, which showed that the nucleic acid-based detection of virus strains was negative for approximately 25% of children with increases of RV peptide-specific IgG levels which may indicate a higher sensitivity of serology vs. PCR in these children. Moreover, PCR results did not correspond well with the specificities of the antibody responses. There were also 14 children without increases of RV peptide-specific antibody responses who had positive PCR results (Fig. 3a, bottom).",

We then analyzed the sum of days with symptoms and medication and found that RV-A and RV-C antibody increases were associated with the highest number of days with symptoms and medication (Fig. 4, bottom panel).

            "text": "Within the European Union-funded project PreDicta (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96868_en.html) we developed the PreDicta chip which is based on 130 micro-arrayed RV-derived proteins and peptides selected to represent the three RV species (RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C). Using the PreDicta chip we could demonstrate in a cohort of 120 pre-school children with acute wheeze and a follow-up visit that the RV-specific antibody response (IgG > IgA) is directed against an N-terminal peptide of the major capsid protein VP1 which confirms earlier results obtained by the mapping of RV89-specific antibody responses33. Since the PreDicta chip was designed to contain a panel of 30 synthetic peptides which represented the most diverse RV strains of the three genetic RV species in terms of sequence identity and physicochemical properties we were able to perform a high-resolution mapping of RV species-specific antibody responses by serology. In a cohort of clinically well-described Swedish pre-school children from whom sera were available from an episode of acute wheeze requiring an emergency room visit and from a follow-up visit after convalescence, peptides from RV-A and RV-C species were most frequently recognized whereas RV-B species were much less commonly recognized. Interestingly, we found that older children (i.e., children older than 2 years of age) recognized peptides from more RV strains than younger children. This result would indicate that children encounter in their life different RV strains and thus may broaden their IgG reactivity profiles later in life but this needs to be confirmed in longitudinal studies with samples taken from the same children at different ages, as has recently been done in the analysis of the evolution of IgE reactivity profiles in allergic children in birth cohorts37\u201340. One of the important findings of our study was that we could demonstrate that IgG reactivity to peptides from certain RV strains increased in the children which may allow identifying the culprit RV species responsible for the acute wheeze by serology. Furthermore, it turned out that increases of IgG responses to RV-A and RV-C species were significantly associated with more severe illness as compared to IgG increases to RV-B. The PreDicta chip thus seems to be not only suitable for identifying the culprit RV species responsible for an exacerbation of respiratory illness by simple serology but also allows to determine those RV species giving rise to severe symptoms. Since we also had results from PCR-based testing of nasal swab samples from the same children we could compare the detection of strain-specific nucleic acid with antibody results. In fact, we found that all children without species-specific antibody increases were also negative in the PCR test. However, there was poor correlation between the PCR results from the nasal samples and the chip-based serological results. Furthermore, with the exception of four children (#3, #61, #65, #72) for which a positive PCR result has been obtained at the follow-up visit, all PCR results were negative at both the acute and follow-up visit in approximately 25% of the children for whom species-specific antibody increases could be clearly demonstrated. Several possibilities for the discrepancies may be considered. For example, it may be possible that the time interval after acute infection chosen for serology was not optimal. However, we have previously investigated the time interval required for the appearance of VP1-specific antibody increases in a controlled infection study36 and it is therefore very unlikely that the time interval used in our study was too long and responsible for discrepancies between PCR testing and serology. We also do not think that cross-reactivity among strains or the original antigenic sin41 is responsible for the observed differences because we have taken care to include on the chip sequences from several different RV strains and the results in Fig. 3a clearly show that the serological results obtained with the chip allow a bona fide discrimination of RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C infections because we have used a large panel of RV peptides on the chip. Finally, we found that older children recognized more RV peptides from different strains than younger children (Fig. 2c\u2013e), which indicates that the children develop antibodies against new viruses and thus the concept of the original antigenic sin does not seem to apply here. One limitation of our study is, however, that we cannot exclude that infections with additional RV strains have occurred in the time window between the first and second blood sampling and thus are responsible for the discrepancy between PCR results and serology. Nevertheless we think that the discrepancy between PCR results and serology is rather due to the fact that not every virus detected by PCR causes an infection with a consecutive immune response. In fact, studies performed in young children report that up to 35% of asymptomatic subjects have positive PCR results30,42. One more likely possibility for the poor correlation of PCR results and antibody results could be that we used a PCR strategy based on primers specific for VP4- and VP2-encoding regions of the viral genome, which may be less specific than PCR strategies based on the amplification and sequencing of the VP1-encoding region or of the complete RV genome12,28,43,44. In general, nucleic acid-based strategies for virus detection only demonstrate the presence of virus-specific nucleic acid but provide no evidence that an infection has taken place which gave rise to a specific immune response. We therefore think that the PreDicta chip and future versions of it containing an even larger repertoire of N-terminal VP1 peptides from more RV strains will be a complementary tool in addition to PCR testing and eventually turn out to be even superior. The antibody test is actually fast and economical: It takes only few hours and requires only microliter amounts of serum. Furthermore, serological analysis is robust and can be easily performed without need for PCR cyclers and subsequent sequencing. However, more prospective studies will be needed to investigate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the RV chip. The PreDicta chip may be extremely useful to determine RV species-specific antibody responses in serum samples from existing cohorts world-wide to define the most common and relevant RV species involved in respiratory illness. Chip-based measurements will allow exploring in prospective studies the role of RV infections in a variety of respiratory disease exacerbations. For example, it will be possible to discriminate whether asthma exacerbations have been triggered by an RV infection or by allergen exposure because it has been shown that both factors (i.e., RV infections as well as allergen exposure) induce increases of specific antibody responses when serum samples collected at the acute visit and during a follow-up visit are compared35,36,45,46. The identification of the culprit factors triggering asthma attacks becomes increasingly important in respiratory medicine due to availability of selective treatments of allergic asthma such as anti-IgE antibodies and a variety of other biologics such as anti-cytokine antibodies targeting different forms of asthma47,48. Furthermore, it will be possible to use the PreDicta chip to study by serological analysis the possible contribution of RV infections in exacerbations of other respiratory diseases such as COPD and ACO. Further studies are also necessary to perform a multiple monitoring of the presence of RV strains and other respiratory viruses by PCR and the immune reaction by serology in close intervals and for extended periods after exacerbation.",

Multiple sequence alignments of the VP1 N-terminal peptides (aa 1\u201340) were performed using ClustalW2 software available at the EMBL-EBI website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/clustalw2) to determine amino acid sequence identities among the peptides. Peptide sequences showing sequence identities greater than 87.5% (i.e. differences of \u22645 aa) were grouped together into clusters (Fig. 1). Sequences among the clusters (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, A1\u2013A17, B1\u2013B9, C1\u2013C3) were re-aligned using GeneDoc software (http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/ibmpc/genedoc-readme.html) and each amino acid mismatch was analyzed regarding physicochemical properties of the amino acids. This procedure led to re-clustering of the peptides (Supplementary Table 2, AI\u2013XVIII, BI\u2013BIX; CI\u2013CIII). From each re-clustered group one representative RV strain peptide was selected for printing onto the chip (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3: RV-A: n = 18; RV-B: n = 9; RV-C: n = 3). An enterovirus-derived peptide was also included (Fig. 1). For the set of peptides to be printed a multiple sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW2 and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the Neighbor-Joining (N-J) method using MEGA 6 software (www.megasoftware.net) (Fig. 1c). The evolutionary distances between sequences were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter model with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 replicates. Additional 36 peptides spanning the RV89VP1 protein (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 4) were selected to detect antibodies towards VP1 epitopes other than the N-terminal portion.",

Recombinant proteins were purified by Nickel-affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions as previously described (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Refolding of recombinant proteins was achieved by a stepwise dialysis against 10 mM NaH2PO4 for structural and non-structural proteins and 20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA for MBP fusion proteins, respectively. The purity of recombinant proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and the identity by immunoblotting using a monoclonal mouse anti-His-tag antibody 1:1000 diluted (Cat: DIA-900, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany).

This cohort and the genotyping of RV strains in the nasopharyngeal swab samples of 108 of the 120 children by nested PCR and sequencing have been previously described35. A molecular diagnostic platform for the rapid detection of 15 respiratory strains was used in 118 of the 120 children. The following respiratory viruses were found: Adenovirus: 7 children; Bocavirus: 8 children; Coronavirus: 6 children; Influenza A/B: 1 child; Metapneumovirus: 3 children; Parainfluenzavirus: 4 children: RSV: 22 children52. For 108 of the 120 children nasopharyngeal swabs had been available for the RV PCR targeting VP4/2 sequences. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or by the legal guardians and the study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Peripheral blood samples had been obtained within 24 h of presentation in the emergency unit and sera were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. In addition to blood samples, nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained at the acute visit and again at the follow-up visit by the research nurse and stored in the biobank at the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital35. Follow-up samples were obtained between 6 and 30 weeks after the initial recruitment (median 11 weeks) at a scheduled visit after recovery. Although this study was not planned as a prospective study for the assessment of increases of RV-specific antibodies, the time interval of 6\u201330 weeks was suited for this purpose because we found in an earlier study that increase of RV-specific IgG responses emerge 42 days after experimental inoculation36. At the follow-up visit, the guardians also filled out a standardized questionnaire concerning the number of days the child had suffered from respiratory symptoms at home (i.e., \u2018cough and/or wheeze\u2019), use of medication (i.e., \u03b22-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonist), as well as about any emergency visits between the acute and follow-up visits.

Results were reported in ISAC standardized units (ISU)50,52. Background reactivities of fluorescence-labeled \u03b1-huIgG antibodies towards all microarray components were determined by testing six replicates of a sample diluent alone. For the characterization of the assay variability, one calibrator serum and three normal sera were profiled at 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, and 1:1000 in order to find a dilution at which the broadest spectrum of reactivity levels were covered. To assess intra-assay (i.e. within experiment) variability, six replicates of four serum samples were used to measure IgG reactivities towards all microarray components on the same day. To assess inter-assay (i.e. between experiments) variability, four serum samples were evaluated in experiments conducted on five consecutive days. The evaluation of four different samples allowed determining whether the inter-assay variability was sample-dependent. For each microarray component, the mean ISU-G, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV% = SD/mean ISU-G) across the six replicates and five different experiments, respectively, were calculated for each sample. Microarray components were classified according to the ISU-G level (>50, 25\u201350, 1\u201325) and averages across all components within these groups on the array were also calculated for each of these quantities.",
