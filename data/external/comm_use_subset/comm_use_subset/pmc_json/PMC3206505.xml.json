            "text": "In the last two decades, as many countries have broadened their network of trading partners, moved quickly to adopt previously unimagined technologies, and hastened the pace of economic migration, it has become increasingly apparent that health too is a global matter that commands a global perspective. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic (There was and is still disagreement as to whether or not SARS was a pandemic. By the Center for Disease Control (CDC) standards, SARS was a pandemic (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no11/04-0797_02.htm). The simplest WHO definition of a pandemic at the time was \u201ca worldwide epidemic of a disease\". Although the World Health Organization (WHO) did indeed declare that we had entered the early phases of a pandemic, the official declaration of the highest stage of a pandemic, Phase 6, was never made) in 2003 accentuated this point, as did the Influenza Type A/H1N1 outbreaks of 2009. But before one jumps to the erroneous conclusion that globalization is the new demon, we need to recall that there have long been global movements of disease with devastating consequences such as the smallpox epidemic brought upon the Aztecs by invading Spanish Conquistadors in the 1500s [1]. No doubt the infrastructural differences in today's world mean the risk of a pandemic is greater than 500 years ago but so too are our defenses, particularly in terms of scientific technologies, research and knowledge transfer capacity, and institutional coordination. This paper outlines a broad approach to framing a strategy for managing and improving global health. For a global health management strategy to be effective, we argue that tactics must take place in at least three essential forms: actions of a directly focused nature, institutional coordination, and disciplinary integration in approaches to health management. We illustrate each level of action with current examples from the livestock sector in Asia including village level interventions to increase food security in Bangladesh, an example from Vietnam of improved institutional integration and cooperation to control emerging infectious disease, and improved capacity of researchers and other health personnel to adopt an ecosystem approach to health management in Asia.",

Root problems may show themselves as poverty and hunger as a result of low incomes and lack of market access in remote villages in northern Bangladesh, lack of awareness or concern for environmental contamination resulting from factors (there are of course innumerable factors, but they include attitudes and preferences, sociocultural beliefs, and the cost of change) including low education or inappropriately distributed market power among stakeholders in livestock producing villages in Southeast Asia, or high institutional transaction costs that prevent collaboration or integration of high-level health management strategies in Vietnam. But regardless of the nature and complexity of the root problems, responses to the challenges of addressing health issues of concern to the global population require improved knowledge, expanded capacity, and determined collaboration of individual stakeholders including end users, researchers, and local-to-regional governments and health related institutions.",

Over the last ten years, these and other nEIDs have appeared in either Bangladesh or Vietnam and sometimes both countries, resulting in significant impact on the health and livelihoods of communities through increased morbidity and mortality of humans and livestock. Furthermore, hundreds of millions of dollars of economic damage has been caused from disruptions in local and regional trade, as well as enforced cessation of livestock production.

The impact and implications of these changes on the health of small-scale livestock producers can be severe, most particularly where zoonotic diseases are involved.

More than 50% of rural livelihoods depend on livestock for nutrition and cash income in both Vietnam [6] and Bangladesh [7], and because the majority of small-scale livestock keepers are women, livestock also generates employment for women and offers them economic decision making power. The importance of this last point is often not fully appreciated with respect to decisions for the welfare of the household. When women who raise livestock are able to decide how and when the income is spent on the household, then they have control over varying and balancing food inputs for children and infants, increasing food security and improving the health of their family.",

This is a major precipitating factor for health problems among the rural poor, leading to low birth weight, delayed physical and mental development, and susceptibility to infections [10]. The use of livestock and horticulture has been accepted as a suitable intervention by some villagers in the Chars area [11] with initial success. Extending this intervention, integrated agriculture (the incorporation of sustainable crop and livestock practices) in an ecohealth (ecohealth can be defined as the field of study and practice that uses systemic and participatory approaches to understanding and promoting health and well being in the context of complex socialecological interactions) framework has been introduced as an additional option to address these extreme problems [12]. Preliminary results indicate that household income increased 60\u201370% when farmers invested in dairy cattle, allowing for economic decisions to be made (and increasing the role of women in making those decisions) regarding purchases of food, clothing, and medicine, and allowing for children to attend local schooling. The result has improved nutrition and economic power of inhabitants, reducing poverty and hunger and increasing child health and employment (For a more thorough example of integrated health management in an ecohealth framework employed to reduce risk of disease, refer to Joshi and associated papers: Durga Datt Joshi and Minu Sharma.

This then is a good example of the first of the three essential forms of tactics in a global health management strategy (and surely the most common): action at the grass roots level, or perhaps more politely termed directly targeted interventions. Regrettably, the other two essential forms of tactics are in relatively early stages in Bangladesh. Disciplinary integration in approaches to health management is rare, and institutional coordination is the exception rather than the rule, largely due to financial, educational, and to some extent political barriers at the level of institutions. Early progress has been made in the form of a National Livestock Policy that advocates these concepts with an action plan although this policy is yet to be ratified by the Government of Bangladesh [14]. This is an important step towards policy support for an integrated approach that will include improved access to health and agricultural services and targeted technical interventions intended to address poverty while leaving intact options for small-scale backyard livestock keeping.",

This could include integrated agriculture rather than focusing on single species of plants and animals, managing water resources to reduce contact of animal species with each other and with humans, developing alternative methods of livestock housing to prevent the transmission of pathogenic organisms, and following simple steps when raising livestock to ensure the health of those livestock and subsequently the health of the families around those livestock.

Although the use of a multidisciplinary team is a giant step in a positive direction, we believe that part of the reason for low adoption may well be the focus on a single species outcome rather than an integrated outcome that balances environmental sustainability with community partnership and free choice of economic activities. In other words, results from adopting integrated agriculture and ecosystem approaches to health management have to be driven by basic understanding of the transdisciplinary issues and by free choice to engage in economic activities.",

The JP is a solid example of multi-institutional effort to address nEIDs and national health inequities using the resources of numerous government ministries and international nongovernment agencies. The JP initially addressed the immediate emergency support needed to control the outbreaks of HPAI that started in 2005. The programme has continued to a new phase in which design and implementation has included international coordination/technical assistance, communication, agriculture (livestock production and animal health), and human health involving the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the Ministry of Health (MoH), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The overall objective of the program is \u201cto reduce the health risk to humans from avian influenza by controlling the disease at source in domestic poultry, by detecting and responding promptly to human cases, and by preparing for the medical consequences of a human pandemic.\u201d More specifically, the program aims at reduced risk of a global pandemic of HPAI emanating from Viet Nam and enhanced national and local capacity to manage outbreaks of diseases of epidemic potential caused by human and animal pathogens.",

However, the concept of sustainable ecosystem health to prevent emerging infectious disease is present in bits and pieces of activities throughout the JP (e.g., surveillance, training of community animal and human health workers, communication, vaccination, and restructuring) but is not a major pillar of understanding behind many of the activities (and was not intended to be). It was also recommended that although an ecohealth philosophy is evidently emerging in the JP strategy, wider knowledge of an ecohealth approach is needed, particularly at lower administrative levels, in order to appreciate the integrated roles of managing the interfaces of animals, humans, and the environment. Most importantly, this must be directed at nEIDs in general, rather than (e.g.,) HPAI or Influenza Type A/H1N1. Expanding this concept, as a broader theme is current being considered in the development of the new phase of the JP.",

In the particular case of an ecohealth approach that includes livestock within an integrated agriculture system, the goal of improving livelihoods through increased food security will be achieved through healthier livestock and humans, leading to improvements in productivity, increased incomes, and a greater degree of control over economic decision making at the household and community level. Ultimately this means less risk of health inequities in agricultural communities in poor countries and a reduction in global poverty and hunger.",
