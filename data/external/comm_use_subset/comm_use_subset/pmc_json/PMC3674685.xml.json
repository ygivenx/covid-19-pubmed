Avian vaccines are an important component of protecting the value of commercial poultry. However, many commercial birds are not vaccinated because of the cost, labor, and difficulty in differentiating infected from vaccinated animals.",

Low pathogenic strains cause a disease that is seldom fatal but results in slower growth and lower egg production. The highly pathogenic form of the disease results in systemic morbidity and a high mortality rate (90\u2013100%). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a significant public health concern because of recent highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks causing human deaths in Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa. According to the world health organization (WHO) update, since 2003 until February 2013, there were 620 confirmed cases of human infection with H5N1, of which 367 died due to disease complications. Although there are avian influenza vaccines approved in the USA for use in commercial poultry, they are subtype specific and costly to administer because they require parenteral delivery (intramuscular or subcutaneous).",

Various heterologous bacterial and viral antigens have been expressed from L. lactis, and antigen-specific immune responses have been reported [4\u201312]. The efficacy of lactococcal vaccines has been validated in many reports that have shown protection from infectious challenge of vaccinated animals [4, 12\u201315]. In mammals, L. lactis does not colonize the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract but remains metabolically active and survives passage after oral administration [16\u201319]. It is thought that noncolonizing bacteria may be preferred over commensal bacteria for vaccine delivery because they may avoid antigen tolerance [20]. Little is known about L. lactis in chickens, but the closely related Streptococcus genus is abundant in chicken gastrointestinal contents [21, 22].",

Six seventeen-day-old Neo Brown chickens were each vaccinated subcutaneously on the back of the neck with a 1 : 1 mixture of Titermax Gold adjuvant and 50 \u03bcg M2e equivalent KLH-M2e conjugate in a total volume of 400 \u03bcL. The subcutaneous vaccination was repeated 2 and 4 weeks later. A negative control group of six seventeen-day-old Neo Brown chickens was not vaccinated. L. lactis control was not used in the experiment because of two reasons: (1) previous data in our lab [8, 14] and previous publications have suggested that L. lactis does not elicit acquired immune response [4\u201315], and (2) the HEPA-filtered primary containment cage within the animal biosafety laboratory-3+ (ABSL-3+) could accommodate only 12 birds at a time and it was decided by investigators and Oregon State ethical committee members to use vaccinated and nonvaccinated groups only. Serum was collected before vaccination and 1 week after the last vaccination. Fecal samples were collected before and after vaccination, mixed with 0.3 mL 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, and 1x protease inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) in PBS, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until assayed.

Current vaccines and natural infection induce a humoral response to two immunodominant viral surface antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, HA and NA undergo intense selective pressure due to the host immune response and are constantly changing. The use of M2e as antigen would avoid the problem of genetic drift and shift that characterizes both HA and NA because M2e is genetically stable. Even under prolonged selective pressure, only a single amino acid (proline to leucine or histidine at position 9) has been found to change in M2e [40]. It is likely that the genetic drift in the highly conserved M2e would be low [26, 41], which suggests that M2e vaccines would be universally effective against many subtypes and would not require seasonal modification like the current influenza vaccines.

Most of the vaccinated chickens developed an M2e-specific serum IgG response. The lack of robust M2e-specific fecal IgA or CD4+ T lymphocyte response could be due to differential processing of antigen by the immune system, which needs to be explored further. This indicates that LL-M2e induced mainly humoral response, but less significant cellular response.",

Previous studies present conflicting results on the mechanism of protection provided by M2e vaccines. Some studies show that antibodies to M2e provide protection [32, 44, 45]. Another study showed no correlation between M2e-specific titer and protection from infectious challenge [46]. Some reports show that M2e vaccines can induce an M2e-specific CD4+ T-cell response that may contribute to protection [47, 48]. Still other reports suggest that M2e-specific antibodies may bind to infected cells and direct natural killer T cells, macrophages, or other host immune cells to kill the infected cell [26, 49\u201351]. A recent article by El Bakkouri et al. [52] has suggested that alveolar macrophages and Fc receptor-dependent elimination of influenza A virus-infected cells are essential for immune protection by anti-M2e IgG. Our results are consistent with a mechanism of protection that depends on an M2e-specific serum IgG response. ",
