The virus was detected in two children from adjacent counties in southern California presenting with febrile respiratory illness [1,2]. These cases were not epidemiologically linked and neither child had exposure to swine. Subsequent phylogenetic characterisation of H1N1/2009 from the U.S. index case (A/California/04/2009) showed that the virus had a unique genome composition that had not been previously identified. Six genes (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) were similar to viruses previously identified in triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses in North American pigs. The remaining two genes (NA and M) were derived from Eurasian swine influenza viruses. This particular gene constellation had never been previously identified in humans or other reservoirs.",

The initial public health response to the outbreak was a containment exercise aimed at preventing the spread of infection, detecting cases and taking action to prevent these cases from infecting others [6]. The exercise was initially based on clinical and epidemiological criteria (table 1). Patients who met these criteria were immediately given treatment and isolated while a rapid real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) for H1N1/2009 was initiated. Contact tracing was undertaken in order to treat those who had been in contact with confirmed cases. Soon after the first detections, person to person transmission was confirmed as having occurred in Scotland. Consequently, the epidemiological criteria were no longer useful and the containment exercise was then based on clinical criteria only. Testing continued to be carried out during this period.",

Consequently, the large number of negative results are unlikely to have been caused by the pathogens already tested for in the screen. However, the respiratory screen does not include an internal control. Consequently, false negatives due to inhibition may have occurred. Nevertheless, the number of samples affected is likely to be small, since a recent in-house audit found that inhibition occurs in ~1% of throat and nasal swabs submitted to our laboratory. Poor sampling may also have led to false negative results. However, as with the case of inhibition, the contribution of this factor is likely to be minimal.",

In future, the use of a larger testing panel either by further developing the existing service or by using an alternative method (e.g. microarray) would be useful to examine negative samples. Another possibility is that other infective and non-infective agents could have been present. For example, the previously-mentioned audit of patients presenting at infectious disease units found an alternative non-respiratory diagnosis in ~40% of patients initially clinically diagnosed as having H1N1/2009 [8]. Another explanation could be that a number of samples were actually from the worried well, or from asymptomatic contacts of known or suspected cases of H1N1/2009. An audit similar to the one outlined in the publication above [8] would help to clarify this issue.",

Consequently, certain patient groups either with or at risk of severe infection may be over-represented in the final data. Whether or not this is the case, the present study shows that numerous respiratory pathogens were being misdiagnosed as H1N1/2009. The misdiagnosis of H1N1/2009 would have had many undesirable consequences. For example, potentially serious conditions may have been wrongly diagnosed as H1N1/2009 [8]. In addition a large number of individuals are likely to have been unnecessarily treated with oseltamivir [10]. This involves unnecessary cost, and would also have exposed individuals to the side effects of oseltamivir [11]. It should further be noted that there could well have been emotional costs in being wrongly labelled as having \"swine flu\", especially at the early stage of the pandemic, when the severity and outcome of the illness was still largely unknown. In hospitalised patients, unnecessary infection control procedures may have been implemented [10-12]. Disease surveillance may also have been inaccurate, affecting public health measures and leading to increased panic/concern in the general public.",

This would no doubt reduce the amount of unnecessary treatment and isolation, and would ensure that surveillance data was more accurate. Such a test would need to be very rapid, sensitive, and specific. Although a number of methods have been described, these can be expensive and - in comparison to PCR-based methods - can be insensitive and non-specific [13]. As a result, PCR methods may be required to investigate influenza negative samples and in low prevalence periods, such as the time period examined in this study, PCR may also be required to confirm positive results.",
