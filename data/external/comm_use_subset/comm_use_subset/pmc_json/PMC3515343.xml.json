            "text": "Ectodermal organogenesis involves the development of many ectodermal organs including hair, feathers, scales, teeth, beaks, nails, horns and several eccrine glands. Despite diverse forms and functions, ectodermal organs exhibit common developmental features. Originating from adjacent layers of epithelial (ectodermal) and mesenchymal (mesodermal or neural crest) tissues, the first visible sign of most ectodermal organs is a local epithelial thickening termed an ectodermal placode. Next, a condensation of mesenchymal cells, or papilla, forms under the placode. The ectodermal placode then buds into or out of the papilla in a process called epithelial invagination. Subsequent morphogenesis drives further development of the epithelial and mesenchymal components and is associated with epithelial folding and branching. This ultimately determines the final shape and size of ectodermal organs; however, it is epithelial invagination that regulates when and how ectodermal organs develop, a fact with important implications for future organ engineering and regeneration [for review see [1]].",

The complex developmental progress at different time points involves sophisticated spatial and temporal regulation of growth factor superfamilies including the Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Tumour necrosis factor (TNF), Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt superfamilies [for review see [2-4]]. Hence, future study requires a more accurate model. The multipotency of embryonic stem cells makes creation of a non-invasive, non-inductive environment for the observation of specific growth factor functions within ectodermal organ development challenging.

Studies have shown that FGF-8 and FGF-9 are expressed within the murine molar epithelium: FGF-8 has a specific role in multicuspid odontogenesis [13,14]; therefore, in this study, we investigated the role of FGF-9, also present within the oral epithelium of the first branchial arch at stage E10. FGF-9 expression is restricted to the dental epithelium until epithelial budding at E11. Although not expressed in the mesenchyme, FGF-9 appears in the cap-stage enamel knot of the E13\u2013E15 mouse embryo, spreading within the inner enamel epithelium until E18 [14]. This suggests that FGF-9 is an important factor during the initiation of tooth germ development. However, tissue slicing and staining cannot provide a real-time model for further investigation and, as FGF-9 is critical to embryonic development, a conventional transgenic approach could cause early defects, or even embryonic demise, interfering with in-depth study.",

It is a real-time, label-free, impedance-based method to study the activities of cells including morphological changes, locomotion, and other behaviors of cells directed by the cytoskeletons. When cells were added to the ECIS Arrays and attached to the electrodes, they play the roles as insulators and increased the impedance. As cells grow and cover the electrodes, the current is impeded in related with cell number, cell morphology, and cell attachment. When cells are stimulated, cell function and cell morphology will be changed and the impedance of cell-to-microelectrode will be changed. The data generated is impedance versus time. The high frequency impedance is caused by the increasing of cell numbers, whereas the low frequency impedance indicates the increasing of spaces between the cells. Previous study had reported that ECIS can be used to identify significant, real-time changes in organ layers caused by the invasive activities of cultured metastatic cells [16]. Because epithelial invagination is also related to the invasive activities of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, which indicated that ECIS would be a good method for detecting epithelial invagination in ectodermal organogenesis. The purpose of this study is to establish a combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model for investigating the real time effects of fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) on epithelial invagination in bioengineered ectodermal organs.",

These findings were concurrent with the gene expression of mesenchymal origin cells, such as odontoblasts, during the early stage of tooth development [19,20]. In addition, FGF-9 can induce early expression of the homeobox protein Msx genes Msx-1 in mesenchymal cells (Additional file 1), which is consistent with previous research [14]. The experimental group also exhibited earlier epithelial differentiation in molar tooth germs at 1 and 10 days in vitro (x 2 and 3).

The absorbance of this colored solution can be quantified by measuring at a certain wavelength (usually between 500 and 600 nm) by a spectrophotometer. The absorption max is dependent on the solvent employed.

We inferred that the well of the 8W10E kit did not provide enough space for further cell proliferation, making it pointless to continue the ECIS study beyond this time point (5, Figure 4B). The impedance data showed that the bioengineered organ increased in thickness approximately fourfold within 7 days. During this period, electrical resistance increased from <400 \u03a9 to >1400 \u03a9 (Figure 4B). Although well size was limited during organ development, we attempted to improve the culture environment by changing the medium in the last 80 h. No further changes in impedance occurred in either the control or FGF-9 groups after this (Figure 4B), indicating that only epithelial thickening occurred.",

Owing to very low Amelogenin expression, we also detected Amelogenin expression at 1 h (Figure 5B) to determine why early impedance is lower in the FGF-9 than the control group. Ameloblastin was significantly elevated by FGF-9 at 12 h (Figure 5A) relative to the control group. Peak Ameloblastin expression was evident at 60 h in the FGF-9 group (Figure 5A). This suggests that FGF-9 accelerates early Ameloblastin expression and induces early accelerated epithelial invagination within 72\u201374 h. FGF-9 also accelerated and sustained Ameloblastin expression during the observation period (Figure 5A). Even at 150 h, the FGF-9 group exhibited significantly higher Ameloblastin expression. Combined with the comparatively lower impedance data of the FGF-9 group (Figure 4B), the evidence suggests that addition of FGF-9 induces early Ameloblastin expression, some early phenotypic characteristics of ameloblasts existed within the epithelial layer and accelerated epithelial invagination.",

            "text": "MTT data suggested that FGF-9 facilitates early mesenchymal cell proliferation (Figure 3A), possibly also increasing endogenous FGF-10 in mesenchymal cells during proliferation. FGF-10 is known to stimulate proliferation in epithelial cells [23], potentially creating larger tooth germs. MTT data also suggested that FGF-9 can stimulate epithelial cell proliferation at 183 h (Figure 3B). Resent research indicates that a TGF\u03b2-FGF9-PITX2 signaling cascade regulates cranial neural crest cell proliferation in palatal mesenchyme during palate formation [24]. It seems FGF-9 can regulate the proliferation and integration within mesenchymal cells in a more specific route, which also control the interaction between ectodermal epithelium and mesenchyme. Previous research [5,25] demonstrated using a bioengineered organ culture system similar to ours that epithelial invagination occurred after 1 week of in vitro culture: if dissociated epithelial cells recombined with intact dissected mesenchymal layers directly, new tooth germs formed faster than that with reaggregated mesenchymal cell layers [5,25]. Our FGF-9 group exhibited faster mesenchymal cell integration in the first 3\u20134 days than previous studies (Figure 4B) [5,6,25]. These results suggest that FGF-9 functions in assisting mesenchymal cells to closely re-integrated, similar to a tissue layer. This might also explain how FGF-9 accelerates epithelial invagination in murine odontogenesis: by facilitating cross-talk and reunion between mesenchymal cells and stimulating epithelial cell layer differentiation, creating an ameloblast layer. Thus, FGF-9 may play a significant role in future stem cell organ regeneration.",

            "text": "Some authors have suggested that Wnt-7b restricts dental organ development to within the maxillary and mandibular arches [26]. Ectopic epithelial Wnt-7b expression, achieved through murine retrovirus infection, downregulates Shh expression within dental organs, completely abrogating their development; however, subsequent local Shh overexpression through beads revives tooth germ development [26]. This suggests that FGF-9 counterbalances Wnt-7b through the Shh pathway. Previous evidence [27] demonstrated that suppressing Shh created a similar phenotype to BMP4 overexpression in the feather model. We propose that FGF-9 plays a significant role in modulating the BMP-Shh \u2018signalling module\u2019 regulating skin appendage morphogenesis [27-29] by accelerating epithelial invagination. Our preliminary results show that FGF-9 upregulates Msx-1 expression within a mesenchymal cell culture (Additional file 1). Previous studies [30] showed that FGFs and BMP4 induced both Msx1-independent and -dependent signalling pathways in early odontogenesis. These results suggest that FGFs and BMPs might influence the same regulatory systems functioning in multiple developmental areas and time points. A significant, proximal\u2013distal pattern exists within the lower jaw epithelium of the mouse embryo [13]: FGF-8 and FGF-9 are expressed in the lateral molar field whereas BMP4 is expressed over the medial incisor area. This specific pattern suggests that FGF-8 and FGF-9 correlate with multicuspid odontogenesis whereas BMP4 correlates with unicuspid odontogenesis. Recent research [31] showed that both BMPs and FGFs target the Notch signalling pathway through the Jagged 2 (Jag2) gene, regulating tooth morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. However, Jag2 expression is downregulated by BMPs but upregulated by FGFs within the dental epithelium. This suggests a specific, counterbalanced relationship exists between FGFs and BMPs. If BMP overexpression suppresses Shh expression, then FGF overexpression may promote Shh expression, accelerating epithelial invagination. We propose an \u2018FGF-BMP balancing system\u2019 (Figure 6), [32] which determines the cusp number in odontogenesis and may similarly regulate feather or skin appendage morphogenesis. These topics are interesting issues for further discussion and require future research.",

(A) Real-time PCR Ameloblastin expression at different time points in the bioengineered organ culture. Ameloblastin expression peaked at 60 h. Ameloblastin expression was significantly higher at 72, 84 and 150 h in the FGF-9 group compared with the control group. (B) Real-time PCR Amelogenin expression at different time points of the bioengineered organ culture. Amelogenin expression was significantly higher in the FGF-9 group compared with the control group at 1 h and peaked at 72 h, coinciding with a significant change in ECIS assay (Figure 4B) and due to epithelial invagination. These two graphs show that the peak Ameloblastin expression at 60 h is followed by a peak Amelogenin expression at 72 h, in agreement with previous research [21]. Significantly higher Amelogenin expression also coincides with early lower impedance data (Figure 4B) and earlier differentiation of tooth germ evident in early organ culture (Additional file 2). These results indicate that FGF-9 can initiate early phenotypic and morphological characteristics of ameloblasts within the epithelium, which coincides with epithelial invagination evident from the ECIS assay (Figure 4B). After invagination, the FGF-9 group still exhibits higher Ameloblastin and Amelogenin expressions than the control group. Because of the clear differences, no mark is necessary to specify the results of the FGF-9 group.",
