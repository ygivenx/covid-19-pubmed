In the United States, mortality arising from respiratory disease is 50% higher in winter than in summer [1]. One contributor to this excess winter mortality is influenza [3], the timing and severity of which can vary significantly from year to year. The association between the annual influenza peak and winter weather in temperate locations has lead to the hypothesis that weather variability could influence influenza mortality variations [4], [5].",

Airborne transmission of Influenza A/Panama virus between guinea pigs was more likely at low temperatures and relative humidities [4]. Because temperature is physically/mathematically linked to relative humidity and thus confounds interpretation, a mass-based humidity measure (such as specific humidity or vapor pressure) provides a stronger relationship to influenza transmission [5]. Given the cold-season decline in specific humidity in temperate climates, a retrospective study [6] showed an association between year-to-year humidity variations and the timing of the influenza seasonal onset in U.S. states. This differs from tropical locations which generally lack a seasonal influenza peak [7]. One theory is that tropical climates are dominated by direct contact transmission which, unlike airborne transmission, is not influenced by air temperature and humidity [7].",

Low temperatures enhance viral stability [4], reduce mucosal blood flow [11], and/or diminish mucociliary clearance [12]. Correlations exist between the number of upper respiratory infections and cold-air outbreaks [13]. It is commonly assumed that winter indoor crowding enhances influenza virus transmission, though direct evidence is lacking [8]. Low humidity conditions, which are often but not always accompanied by low temperatures, enhance survival times of viral aerosols [14], [15], [16]. If correct, these relationships suggest that indoor winter heating without humidification could enhance influenza transmission [8], as indoor absolute humidity tends to be correlated with outdoor values and thus is typically lower in winter [6].",

The virulence of the influenza virus changes constantly as the virus undergoes antigenic shift and antigenic drift [8].

Our study examines daily mortality, and statistical robustness is enhanced when the daily sample size is sufficiently large. Weather obviously has a high spatial variability, so it is important that the observed weather be representative of the environmental conditions likely experienced by the decedents. In addition, New York City's mid-latitude location provides a high degree of both interannual and intra-annual variability in weather and climate, so this variability provides a wider range of sample conditions. Thus, New York City has both a large enough population to provide a consistent daily mortality signal while the population density is high enough that the weather observed at a single station is sufficiently representative of conditions experienced throughout the metropolitan area.",

These diseases are commonly combined as an endpoint because of specific challenges associated with influenza. First, the number of deaths attributable to influenza is difficult to estimate directly because of a lack of virologically-confirmed infections. Second, many influenza-associated deaths occur from secondary complications when influenza viruses are no longer detectable by laboratory means [6], [23], [24], [25]. Third, the use of P&I mortality in the study of influenza also reflects the problems associated with other measures of prevalence of influenza. Reporting of cases of influenza through routine channels is unsatisfactory because mild influenza may be under-diagnosed and the use of laboratory confirmation is skewed by the impact of variable testing patterns based on prevalence of disease [26]. Finally, multiple studies have shown that there exists a relationship between influenza morbidity and P&I mortality that can be mathematically described and used in epidemiological studies [3], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31].",

This procedure adjusts for temporal changes in age demographics over the period of record based on data for each county using U.S. Census archives, thereby allowing for consistent comparisons of mortality rates over time. After age standardization, the long-term mean for each day (within ICD period) was subtracted from that day's standardized P&I mortality to remove the inherent seasonal signal from the time series.

The time between infection and a resulting mortality event (i.e. \u201clatency\u201d) varies between individuals depending on age, overall health, co-morbid conditions, and other factors. Thus, lags must be estimated to best fit the overall data structure. Similarly, the high frequency variability in the variables requires some smoothing to elucidate relationships, and the selection of appropriate smoothers is somewhat subjective. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with several others. For example, there is evidence supporting a two-week lag between rising influenza virus and pneumonia mortality [28]. Other research showed fairly convincingly the existence of a 2\u20134 week lag between laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza and increased incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease [43]. The weather variables used in this study do not directly account for the ambient conditions experienced by the influenza victims while indoors, but cold and/or stormy weather could result in the decedents spending more time in heated indoor environs with low humidity, thereby enhancing infection opportunities [8].",

Identifying periods of low dew point temperatures a few days or even weeks in advance is well within the skill of existing weather forecast models.
