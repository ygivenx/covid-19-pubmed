In recent years, the 2001 anthrax attacks, the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the extraordinary destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the pandemic from the novel H1N1 influenza virus have provided vivid examples of how natural and man-made phenomena can wreak havoc on the health and well-being of a community. Public health agencies have received increased attention and visibility following these events, which have been met with public investments in preparedness, as well as heightened expectations of the public health system\u2019s ability to prevent, detect, and contain health threats to communities [1], [2].",

            "text": "As expectations have expanded, the need to strengthen public health systems\u2019 capacity and capabilities to respond to any hazard has been at the center of many policy discussions [1], [2]. However, the evidence base for how to achieve this priority has lagged behind. There is still little agreement on how to measure, let alone improve, public health response performance [3], [4]. A number of challenges have been cited as barriers to research advancement in this field, including: the infrequent nature of large-scale public health emergencies [3], [5]\u2013[7], the heterogeneity of emergency events and of public health delivery structures [3], [6], the challenges with access to incident leadership during real-world emergencies [7], the limited ability for standardized surveys to measure complex agency and system processes [6], and the difficulty of identifying a comparison group or constructing a counterfactual of what might have occurred if particular public health interventions had not taken place [8], [9]. As a result, outside of statistical modeling, researchers have often been limited in their use of statistical methods to test hypotheses, reach generalizable conclusions, and isolate factors that are likely to have the greatest impact on response capacity [8], [10]. Additionally, because catastrophic events are infrequent, the majority of the measurement literature in this field has focused on preparedness rather than on response -- on identifying and measuring the inputs to preparedness rather than the variations in response performance. What is known about public health emergency response is largely derived from simulated emergencies (e.g. exercises or drills), with a primary focus on bioterrorism or pandemic influenza [3]. By relying on an evidence base that draws from a narrow set of threats, we run the risk of overemphasizing the capabilities and resources required for those incidents while neglecting those that may be essential in other scenarios [11]. Furthermore, simulated emergencies introduce artificialities that do not reflect real-world response situations [12].",

First, we concentrate on characterizing responses to real-world events rather than preparedness and response efforts for hypothetical scenarios. Second, we broaden the case material to include acute public health events, not just disasters. And third, we compare response features across incidents rather than identifying lessons learned from single isolated incidents. The methodological basis for this approach is that while each event is unique, the number and type of response activities are finite; therefore, through comparative analysis, we can learn about commonalities in the response patterns that could improve understanding of the resources and capabilities required to respond to future acute events.",

For this study, we collected highly-structured data on more than 120 real-world acute incidents, representing the broadest examination of events that have stressed the local public health system in the United States. By pooling data across diverse incident contexts and types, we increase the number of opportunities for learning [13]\u2013[15]. This study serves as a starting point for the development of evidence-based forecasts of public health system response behavior that will help shape researchers\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 expectations for public health activity during urgent events and identify situations in which a governmental public health response has deviated from these expectations. Such deviations or \u201csurprises\u201d can provide opportunities to improve and update our understanding of response performance by pointing either to a lack of sophistication in our predictive models, adaptive response behaviors or promising practices that could be applied in other situations to beneficial effect, or unnecessary variation associated with inefficiencies that may affect the health of a community or the reputation of public health agencies.",

The domains selected for this investigation were informed by a study of the organization and delivery of local public health services during normal operations by Mays et al. (2009), which employed similar measures in the expectation that they could reasonably be expected to influence performance and outcomes [16], [17].

As a result, after approximately one-quarter of our sample had been recruited, we shifted our outreach strategy and targeted either (1) the preparedness coordinator, or (2) the communicable disease director or epidemiologist, in an effort to identify a range of infectious and non-infectious disease events. Each round of recruitment lasted six weeks, during which, individuals were sent the initial email invitation and study description, a reminder postcard by mail, three email reminders, and a telephone or voicemail follow-up. Individuals were also informed that they could forward the invitation to another person within the health department who might be better positioned to participate, and that multiple people could participate in a single interview.",

In contrast, a non-adaptive response system would engage similar functions and partners regardless of incident type. Accordingly, our predictor variable was the type of event. Each incident was assigned to one of six specific event type categories, as defined by the CDC Emergency Preparedness and Response website, including: infectious disease outbreaks and incidents, natural disaster or severe weather events, bioterrorism events, mass casualty events, chemical emergency events, or radiation emergency events\n[21].

The Capabilities framework identifies and defines 15 types of services that public health systems might be expected to deliver during emergencies. We deviated from this framework for the purpose of data collection in three key ways. First, we added four categories that emerged as important public health response activities through previous related work and pilot-testing but that are not emphasized in the PHEP Capabilities document. These categories included: environmental investigations, evacuation, consulting subject matter experts, and assessing medical and public health response capacity. Second, we eliminated the \u201cpreparedness\u201d category from the list of public health response activities included in the interview since pilot-testing proved it was a confusing concept in the context of a specific response effort. Finally, we collected \u201cother\u201d activities that participants felt were important aspects of the response that had not otherwise been captured in the interview. Interviewers described each of the 19 response activity categories (14 original PHEP Capabilities, four additional categories, and an \u201cother public health response activity\u201d category) and asked participants to indicate whether any related activities were initiated during the response to their selected event. Additionally, participants were asked to identify which of the response activities were \u201cabsolutely necessary to the overall response.\u201d A summary score was calculated by summing the total number of public health response activities initiated during an event (between 0 and 19 activities).",

First, our results demonstrate that public health response systems are adaptive to the nature of the threat. Our study response profiles reveal differential activation - in both number and type - of functions and partners based on the type of incident. For example, we found that the public health response to severe weather events involved a much larger and more diverse set of organization systems when compared to infectious disease events. Within the field of public organization theory, these non-infectious disease systems would be expected to elicit a number of predictable challenges to effective communication and coordination [30], [31]. With a more explicit recognition of these complex systems, researchers and practitioners may be able to better able to predict associated challenges, their consequences, and strategies for avoiding critical failure points during urgent events. Second, our study system profiles also provide an indication of the frequency and circumstances with which particular organizations might become involved in public health response activities \u2013 information that is of the greatest importance when developing and fostering relationships with potential partners in the community. We found that some entities are likely to take part in a public health response of any nature, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, and members of the general public, whereas many other organizations are either infrequently involved in public health responses or typically have a role only under specific event circumstances. The American Red Cross provides a good example of an organization that was almost universally active in our severe weather and mass casualty events, but rarely took part in infectious disease or bioterrorism events. Furthermore, the partner agencies described in our study, with few exceptions, lent their expertise or resources to a very limited proportion to the overall public health response activities. One interpretation of this finding is that only a fraction of response efforts will be salient to those organizations. Alternatively, this could suggest opportunities for expanded roles of organizations in response efforts. Lastly, we found that the role of public health varied tremendously by type of event. Public health departments were ten times more likely to serve in a lead role for infectious disease events compared to events involving severe weather. Recognizing these response patterns can have an impact on planning and exercising with partner agencies, particularly with respect to setting expectations and developing a mutual understanding about the roles and responsibilities of public health agencies in various situations, an issue that has repeatedly been recognized as an area needing improvement [3], [32].",

For example, while far from comprehensive or validated, our data identified three conceptual models of response. In the first model of response, most typical of infectious disease events, public health agencies serve in the lead role to the overall response; response activities and partners are more limited in number and type; the number of cases define event severity; and the epidemiology and surveillance function is considered most essential to the response. In the second model of response, most typical of severe weather and natural disasters, public health agencies serve in a joint or supporting role to the overall response; response activities and partners are more numerous and diverse; disruption to community infrastructure defines event severity; and environmental health and mass sheltering and care activities are considered most essential to the response. In the last model of response, typical of events involving chemical exposure or biological agents, public health agencies serve in a joint or supporting role to the overall response; response activities are moderate in number; response systems involve atypical partners; number of persons exposed defines event severity; and information and incident management activities are considered most essential to the response. An approach that uses \u201cprototypical\u201d models for response, such as this, could provide the basis for a new avenue of planning that builds on the strengths of those currently used. Like planning based on single scenarios (e.g. aerosolized anthrax), response models are grounded in concrete real-world incidents, making it easier to conceptualize the likely functional and structural aspects of a response. This allows for the development of detailed response protocols, which can be used to guide the training of staff and purchase of resources needed to test, implement, and improve these plans [11]. At the same time, the conceptual models are general enough that insights and skills gained from planning for one threat can be expected to be applicable, although not identical, to other hazards with a similar profile, increasing the efficiency of planning.",

This planning model, based on an assumption that preparedness can be achieved by directing resources towards building, testing, and improving defined priority areas, is at the core of the CDC \u201cpreparedness capabilities\u201d that were used to characterize the response activities described by our informants. Consequently, our results complement the PHEP Capabilities by highlighting the circumstances in which related activities or functions might have particular relevance in practice. Not surprisingly, our study finds that certain types of events were much more likely to elicit response activities related to particular capabilities, and that the frequencies with which capability-related activities were performed did not necessarily equate with how \u201cessential\u201d that capability was to the overall event. For example, the epidemiology and surveillance capability was almost universally activated. However, it was more likely to be considered \u201cessential\u201d for certain types of incidents, particularly infectious disease events. Linking our results to the CDC PHEP Capabilities framework may be of particular value to preparedness planners, for example, by guiding the selection of exercise scenarios that would be most likely to trigger activities related to the capabilities they seek to assess or improve. In addition to the original PHEP Capabilities, we also asked participants about four additional categories of activities that were identified through our previous research and pilot testing as (1) important and (2) of a different character than the PHEP Capabilities. These activities included: environmental or product investigation, consulting subject matter experts, assessing public health or medical capacity, and evacuation. While each of these proved to have relevance in certain contexts, environmental and product investigations stand out because informants mentioned these activities with such frequency, and considered these activities as essential in more than one-third of infectious disease, chemical, and severe weather incidents.",

This study was also strengthened by the availability of organizational data, provided by the 2010 Profile of LHDs, which provided a sampling frame of local health departments, allowing us to better understand the representativeness of our sample and interpret our findings, and affording us the opportunity to examine how characteristics of a health department influence our outcomes of interest [18]. Finally, our approach also draws strength from the application of a systems-based and functions-based approach, both seen as essential features of high-quality research in this field [3]. By using the CDC PHEP Capabilities as a framework for conceptualizing public health activities, we hope to be able to contribute to the scientific literature in a way that is standardized, and thus allows for comparison with future research.",

            "text": "While our results describe the responses to a wide range of incidents, our method of event-finding did not draw from a sample that is statistically representative of all health departments or urgent public health incidents across the United States. Representativeness was not a cornerstone of our sampling goal; however, in order to appropriately interpret the findings of this study, we believe that it is important to recognize the ways in which our findings are not representative. First, while we were able to achieve the desired number of events for comparison, we had a fairly low overall response rate (35%). Based on the reasons for not participating provided by a subset of our non-participants, a significant proportion of health departments in this group may not have experienced an incident that met our study criteria. Therefore, we believe that the true response rate of eligible LHDs was considerably higher. Nonetheless, we recognize that participating agencies systematically differed from those who did not participate: they were significantly more likely to serve a larger population, have higher public health expenditures per capita, and have more full-time staff. Non-participants health departments\u2019 capacity or inclination to participate may be related to a specific response profile that is underrepresented in our results. Second, we allowed participants to select a single event, which is one of many from which they could have potentially chosen. We do not claim to know anything about the events that were not selected; therefore, it is not possible to know how representative our set of events really is. We do know that the distribution of event types in our sample is similar to that found in other research [18]. Furthermore, certain types of events occur more frequently in our dataset, such as norovirus outbreaks and hurricanes. As a result, each event profile is disproportionately influenced by these more frequent events. Lastly, health departments that served a population of fewer than 50,000 individuals were excluded from our sampling strategy. The response system attributes of these health departments, which often have very limited staffing, warrant additional study.",

As an extension of this work, we recommend that future studies examine the types of events that were less commonly reported in our sample, including mass casualty and chemical events, and suggest continued use of standardized data gathering to ensure that future guidance, policy, and research is grounded in the best evidence learned through real-world events.",
