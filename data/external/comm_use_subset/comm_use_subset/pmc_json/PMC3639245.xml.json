These include a) an intra-molecular duplex (formed via sequence complementarities) having to be unwound for decoding, and b) one of three potential reading-frames having to be maintained for faithful protein synthesis. The ribosome possesses helicase activity that allows for the unwinding of RNA duplexes [1], [2] while reading-frame maintenance is closely coupled with translocation [3]. However, unwinding of specific RNA structures can pause or stall the ribosome for further elongation regulation [4]. In particular, specific mRNA signals can program a ribosome to switch reading-frames during elongation, with the ribosome slipping backward (toward the 5\u2032-direction) or forward (toward the 3\u2032-direction) by a single nucleotide. It then continues translation in the new\u22121 or +1 reading-frame. Such\u22121 or +1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) has been characterized in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and is usually related to specific cellular functions [5].",

Most models of\u22121 PRF stimulation propose that a specific structural or mechanical feature of the stimulator resists the unwinding activity of ribosomal helicases [2]. This is done either passively by serving as a roadblock to pause ribosomal movement or actively by creating tension/strain to communicate with transfer RNA (tRNA)-mRNA linkages to destabilize the P site codon-anticodon helix in the 0-frame (XXY). It also eventually facilitates re-pairing of tRNA with the\u22121 frame mRNA (XXX) [2], [3], [8], [9], [10].",

In particular, an optimally placed internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in prokaryotic mRNA may serve as a \u22121 PRF stimulator by pairing with the anti-SD element in 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the 70S ribosome [11]. In addition, \u22121 frameshifting efficiency can be affected positively or negatively by flanking sequences upstream of a slippery site [12], [13]. Previously, we identified a 170-nucleotide RNA element (ATT), upstream of the\u22121 PRF slippery site of SARS-CoV mRNA, capable of down-regulating viral\u22121 PRF [14]. Recently, ATT was shown to optimize viral replication and was suggested to act by causing a fraction of the elongating ribosome to fall-off in front of the ATT [15]. Understanding how\u22121 PRF attenuation is achieved would not only shed light on how a \u22121 PRF stimulator promotes\u22121 frameshifting and provide insight into the mechanism governing reading-frame control, but also may have potential for antiviral applications because\u22121 PRF efficiency is crucial for the replication of several human viral pathogens, including HIV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [15], [16].",

Additionally, we show that attenuation efficiency is not sensitive to E site sequence variation, suggesting flanking-sequences effect is not the main cause of attenuation. We further demonstrate that this minimal element acted through a hairpin form with attenuation efficiency determined by hairpin stability and spacing to the slippery site. Importantly, this potential hairpin also enhanced +1 frameshifting in yeast, indicating that in addition to being a \u22121 frameshifting attenuator, it can serve as a +1 frameshifting stimulator. Together, these results indicate that the upstream RNA hairpin functions as a cis-acting RNA motif in programmed frameshifting regulation. Finally, our findings also indicate base-pair reformation involving the terminal sequences of the 3\u2032-half of the hairpin stem as being crucial for attenuation. This implies the existence of a refolding hairpin stem in close proximity to the ribosomal E site.",

            "text": "In the past, the refolding pathway of unwound RNA structures within ribosome cores has not been comprehensively investigated. Interestingly, the crystal structure of an elongation mode of the 70S ribosome indicates that nucleotides within the first codon upstream of the E codon are flexible [17]. The implication being that these nucleotides are accessible for base-pair formation. Therefore, we disrupted two potential AU base pairs in the lower stem of the predicted hairpin to generate two AC mismatched mutations at the 13363\u201313520 construct. We found that the resultant 5\u2032CC-WT construct lost two-thirds of its attenuation activity compared with an intact hairpin (Figs. 2B and 2C). Because both 5\u2032CC-WT and 13363\u201313520 constructs share 27 identical nucleotides upstream of their slippery sites, the attenuation activity difference is not likely to be caused by an E-site flanking sequences effect [12], [13] but rather by the disruption of the two potential AU base pairs. Similar results were observed for GC-SB-WT and 6BPGC hairpins when potential Watson-Crick base pairs were disrupted (Figs. 2B and 2C). Together, these results suggest that base-pair formation and the composition of the predicted hairpin stem are crucial for efficient attenuation. Next, we swapped six GC base pairs for six corresponding wild-type base pairs in the predicted hairpin stem within a longer SARS-CoV viral sequence (13318-WT) (Fig. 3A) and found that the attenuation activity of the chimera was further enhanced both in vitro and in 293T cell cultures (Fig. 3B and 3C), indicating that the predicted stem-loop is a major determinant of \u22121 PRF attenuation activity in SARS-CoV ATT.",

In particular, the formation of two base pairs involving 3\u2032- flanking UU invaded the 0 frame E site of the ribosome when the slippery sequence occupied ribosomal P and A sites. This invasion could interfere with the proposed reading-frame maintenance function of the E site [18]. However, mutagenesis analysis indicates that in vitro attenuation activity of the 6BPGC hairpin is not sensitive to base-pair formation involving 3\u2032- flanking UU sequences (Figs. S1A and S1B). On the other hand, disrupting potential base pairs at 3\u2032- flanking CG impaired attenuation activity by a third (Fig. S1B compares UUCG-6BPGC with GAAA-6BPGC). Especially important is the disruption of two GC base pairs at the bottom of the hairpin stem (6BPGC12AG). Such a disruption dramatically reduced attenuation activity. This evidence seems to show that two extra GC base pairs involving 3\u2032- flanking CG lead to an extended stem and contribute to attenuation activity. However, only one potential GC base pair exists in the corresponding region of wild-type SARS-CoV viral RNA sequences (Fig. 3A), suggesting that this extra base pair is not essential for attenuation activity by the wild-type SARS-CoV attenuator hairpin. To see if these observations are valid and applicable to a different stimulator in other biological systems, selected 6BPGC 5\u2032-flanking sequence mutants were placed upstream of a distinct \u22121 PRF stimulator, the DU177 pseudoknot [19], and examined for their attenuation activity in 293T cells. The results (Fig. S1C) indicate that the two potential base pairs involving E-site sequences are not the main cause of observed attenuation activity in 293T cell cultures.",

To address this issue, we created mutants by inserting different numbers of nucleotides between the two extra GC base pairs of the extended 6BPGC hairpin stem and the slippery site (Fig. 5A). When the spacing was increased from 2 to 5 nucleotides, attenuation activity was reduced by about a half. It was reduced further by the insertion of additional nucleotides (Figs. 5B and 5C). The spacing dependency of attenuation activity in yeast and a construct containing the DU177 pseudoknot stimulator was also examined and confirmed (Fig. 5D). Varying the ratio between mRNA and ribosomes in in vitro assays so that the amount of ribosomes available for each mRNA was different did not affect attenuation activity significantly (Figs. 5E and 5F). This result indicates that the lower attenuation activity attributable to a distant hairpin is not likely due to hairpin unwinding by an adjacent marching ribosome. Cumulatively, these results establish the following: 1) attenuation activity of a hairpin depends on its spacing to the slippery site; 2) attenuation functions are preserved among distinct eukaryotic systems; and 3) attenuators down-regulate distinct \u22121 PRF stimulators.",

As E site sequences can affect the potency of downstream stimulators [12], [13], we ask whether the potency of attenuators can be affected by either proximal E site sequences or downstream stimulators. A weakened M1 attenuator hairpin, derived from a 6BPGC hairpin with a disrupted GC base pair (in the middle of the hairpin stem (Fig. 6A)), and a potent DU177 \u22121 PRF stimulator were used to address these issues. They were chosen because a potent 6BPGC hairpin attenuated a weaker SARS \u22121 PRF stimulator so efficiently that the resultant intensity of radioactivity in in vitro assays gave uncertain results (data not shown). Consistent with flanking sequences effects, changing sequences in the \u22121 frame E site led to variations in \u22121 frameshifting efficiencies. These were promoted by the same stimulator regardless of the absence or presence of an M1 attenuator. However, calculated \u22121 PRF attenuation efficiencies of the M1 attenuator remained virtually unchanged among different E-site sequence variants (Fig. 6B), indicating that the attenuator down-regulates \u22121 PRF to a similar extent under flanking-sequences effects. By contrast, attenuation efficiencies of the M1 attenuator were different among constructs containing DU177 or SARS \u22121 PRF stimulator (Fig. 6C), implying discrimination toward distinct stimulators.",

It is caused by a ribosomal pause at the AGG codon due to the low expression levels of decoding tRNA in yeast. Mutating AGG to CGG partially impairs +1 frameshifting activity [21]. We reasoned that a partially functional CUUCGGC sequence represented an ideal platform for evaluating the properties of an upstream 6BPGC hairpin (Fig. 7). Indeed, a reporter construct of AGG-containing hepta-nucleotides possessed high +1 frameshifting activity (compared with random-sequence negative controls) whereas the +1 frameshifting activity of a reporter with CGG-containing hepta-nucleotides decreased significantly (Fig. 7). In this study, the smaller difference in +1 frameshifting efficiency between AGG and CGG constructs compared with that of Ty1 retrotransposon may result from a difference in E site sequence identity (CGC versus CAC) [22]. Importantly, we found that an upstream 6BPGC hairpin with 5\u2032-flanking sequences designed to prevent direct E site invasion stimulated +1 frameshifting of the CGG-containing shift site (Fig. 7). By contrast, mutants carrying mutations to disrupt base pairs at the hairpin stem (5\u2032-WT construct of Fig. 7) lost the ability to stimulate +1 frameshifting. Therefore, this upstream 6BPGC hairpin may act as a +1 frameshifting stimulator and is indeed a programmed reading-frame switch regulator.",

Comparison of the encoded amino acids between constructs 13363\u201313520 and 5\u2032CC-WT (Fig. 2) in mutation sites that disrupts 2 AU base pairs reveals a leucine to proline change.

Thus, reduced \u22121 PRF attenuation activity in 5\u2032CC-WT is not caused by the replacement of encoded leucine with proline in the mutation sites. Additionally, amino acid compositions encoded by 6BPGC, r-Bulge, and 6GC hairpin (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2) are changed further (Table S1) with the maintenance of substantial \u22121 PRF attenuation activity.

Our observation of a positive correlation between hairpin stability and attenuation efficiency (Fig. 4D) strongly suggests that base-pair reformation of the upstream hairpin stem plays a crucial role in the reduction of \u22121 PRF efficiency. Furthermore, mutating two nucleotides (27 nucleotides upstream of the E site) to disrupt Watson-Crick base pairs in the lower hairpin stem dramatically impairs attenuation activity (Fig. 2), indicating that attenuation is not caused by primary sequence-mediated flanking-sequences effects [12], [13]. Together, these observations support the idea that a ribosomal unwound hairpin stem can partially reform when the final codon in the 3\u2032-half of the lower stem leaves the E site. The proposed ribosomal fall-off hypothesis that has original ATT impeding ribosome processivity [15] could work here. However, such a mechanism should decrease the observed efficiencies for both +1 PRF and \u22121 PRF. Additionally, the 6GC hairpin used in this work is not likely to cause a ribosome to fall off because the ribosomal helicase is capable of unwinding a duplex of 27 base pairs [1]. This raises the question of what the other potential mechanisms responsible for programmed reading-frame regulation by a refolding hairpin are.",

            "text": "Although final proof of the existence of a refolding hairpin stem proximal to the ribosomal E site during \u22121 PRF stimulation awaits direct physical evidence such as ribosome crystallography and mRNA : rRNA cross-linking analysis, the available 70S ribosome structure mimicking the elongation stage of translation indicates that duplex formation between SD and anti-SD can exist 5 to 6 nucleotides upstream of the P site [17] and overlaps the region where the cis-acting hairpin stem reforms. Additionally, Cryo-EM structures of the 80S ribosome-bound viral internal ribosomal entry site indicate that a folded structure can be accommodated in the space surrounding the mRNA exit site [24], [25]. In this context, SD\u22c5anti-SD duplex formation has been shown to change the mRNA exit channel pathway and create numerous ribosomal interactions [26]. Thus, formation of a refolding cis-acting hairpin stem could create contacts with the 80S ribosome to modulate the E site network and regulate a programmed reading-frame switch. In a non-mutually exclusive model, the +1 frameshifting stimulation and \u22121 PRF attenuation properties of a refolding hairpin can be explained by a pulling force in the 5\u2032-direction generated by hairpin stem closure. This explanation is consistent with proposed mechanical tension triggered by a \u22121 PRF stimulator [2]. In agreement with this active role, a refolding GC-rich hairpin has been shown to exert a 5\u2032-pulling force on RNA-DNA hybrids at the active site of RNA polymerase [27]. Alternatively, the upstream hairpin may serve as a wheel chock that blocks \u22121 ribosomal movement during late stage of hairpin refolding. Thus, a stable hairpin upstream of the slippery site represents a cis-acting RNA motif for \u22121 PRF attenuation. This is in contrast to the downstream \u22121 PRF stimulator. These revelations should be of much interest when further studies on the programmed frameshifting mechanism are being planned. By contrast, a much more stable structure, such as the original ATT in SARS CoV, could still affect viral \u22121 PRF efficiency by serving as a translational attenuator as previously proposed [15]. However, deletion of six nucleotides to disrupt the minimal upstream hairpin stem in an ATT-containing construct (construct 13318\u201313520 \u03946 in Fig. 4B) restored \u22121 PRF efficiency to that of the ATT-lacking 13390\u201313520 construct in vitro (compare lanes 1 and 4 of Fig. 4B and Fig. 1B).",

However, moving the cis-acting attenuator hairpin 5\u2032 further reduced its \u22121 frameshifting attenuation activity (Fig. 5), whereas moving the internal SD\u22c5anti-SD duplex further upstream of the slippery site converted the duplex into a \u22121 PRF stimulator [11]. A possible reason is that the 16S rRNA component of 70S ribosome is part of the functional duplex, whereas the eukaryotic ribosome does not have an anti-SD sequence. It will be interesting to see if an in-cis acting RNA hairpin can replace the functionality of internal SD\u22c5anti-SD interaction in the 70S ribosome.",

Attenuation efficiency of an upstream hairpin was defined as the difference in frameshifting efficiency between two constructs with or without an upstream hairpin, divided by the frameshifting efficiency value of the construct without the upstream hairpin. Experiments were performed in triplicate and reported as one standard deviation from the mean.",
