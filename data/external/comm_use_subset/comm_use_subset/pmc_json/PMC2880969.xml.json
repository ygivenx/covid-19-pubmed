Other members of the genus include measles virus (MV) and rinderpest virus (RPV). The genome of CDV is approximately 15,690 nucleotides (nt) in length, containing several genes encoding N, P, M, F, H, and L proteins. Only one serotype has been characterized [1].",

Previous studies[3,4] have reported that vaccinated dogs were infected with CDV in Europe and Japan. Harder et al. also reported that there are marked differences between wild-type and vaccine strains of CDV[5], thus whether CDV vaccine strains are able to provide protection from the current strains of CDV remains a question. It is difficult and necessary to discriminate between wild-type and vaccine strains because the attenuated CDV vaccine is used widely in China. So a method to specifically detect the wild-type CDV strains is necessary. The multiplex reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) method could be used to effectively detect and differentiate between wild-type CDV-infected dogs from dogs which were vaccinated with CDV vaccine, which would make it useful in clinical diagnosis and epidemiological monitoring.",

Complementary DNA and RNA probes have been used to detect RNA and mRNA of the CDV genome with improved specificity and sensitivity[6,7]. Primers P1 and P4 (specific for CDV and conserved among CDV species), primer P2 (specific for CDV wild-type strain), and primer P3, P5 (specific for CDV vaccine strain), were selected from the well-conserved regions of the gene encoding matrix protein. A fragment of 600 bp was consistently amplified by RT-PCR with P1/P4 for either CDV vaccine strain or wild-type strain. The nested PCR with P2/P4 generated a 247 bp fragment only for the wild-type strain, while P3/P4, P5/P6 generated a same 177 bp fragment only for the vaccine strain, and both fragments could be amplified from the mixture of CDV vaccine and wild-type strains. No amplification was obtained for NDV and other common canine viruses, such as CCV, CPV, CAV, RV, and uninfected cells control, indicating the high specificity of the method. The method was sensitive, in that it could detect as little as 0.1 TCID50 of the virus. The selected two samples were classified into a branch which belongs to the wild-type strain, but constituting a genotype different from that of CDV vaccine strains, as revealed by phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the H gene region, which is believed to be the most reliable classification and genetic typing. RT-nPCR was used to detect the 30 field samples in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces; 20 of the field samples were CDV-positive, among which 15 were wild-type strain, and 5 were vaccine strain.",
