Viruses are responsible for 30-70 % of ARI where respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), human Bocavirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus and Coronaviruses account for the majority of these cases [1, 2]. The 2009 influenza pandemic had highlighted the need for more global data on severe influenza disease, so the WHO recommended conducting surveillance for hospitalized severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), as well as influenza-like illness (ILI) in outpatients [3\u20136]. SARI surveillances are now conducted in many countries around the world; however, because of limited resources, they are only conducted in limited settings in the Middle East and Egypt [7\u20139]. Furthermore, the role of individual viral or atypical bacterial infection in causing ARI is not usually documented [10, 11].",

Due to an annual review by dedicated investigators and updates to WHO guidelines, the case definition for SARI has evolved over the study period. Before February 2010, as a global-surveillance case definition of SARI did not exist, the definition for SARI was adapted from the WHO protocol on rapid response for persons \u22655 years old [3]. Whereas, for children <5 years old, SARI definition was adapted from the program for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness [4]. After March 2011, the global standards and tools for influenza surveillance developed by the WHO were adopted [5]. As of January 2014, the WHO surveillance case definitions for SARI was implemented [6] as follows, acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of \u2265 38 C\u00b0; and cough; with onset within the last 10 days; and requiring hospitalization [6]. An enrollment form was used to collect data from enrolled eligible patients including patient demographics, medical history, clinical signs and symptoms, comorbidities, reported influenza vaccine status, recent travel history, treatment, clinical course, and outcome. Patients with incomplete medical records were excluded.",

For all samples, the human RNase P gene (RP) was tested as an internal positive control to ensure proper sample collection and nucleic acid extraction. Samples were considered positive to the viral target if the amplification curve crossed the threshold line before cycle 40. All clinical samples should be positive to RP with cutoff value \u2264 37, as prescribed previously [8].

Indicators of severe disease were assessed for each pathogen of interest using Mantel-Haenszel estimates to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals and the Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test to assess statistical significance [13]. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between viral respiratory pathogens and severe outcomes, defined as illness requiring ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) or resulting in death while controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. Only variables with statistically significant univariate association with severe outcomes were included in multivariate regression analysis.
