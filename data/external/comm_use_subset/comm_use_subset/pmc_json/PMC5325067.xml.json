            "text": "To simplify the infectious cycle of rabies, exposure is direct, not by environmental deposition, but rather individual-to-individual intra- and inter-specific transmission, usually occurring via bite. Millions of highly neurotropic virions are excreted intermittently in the saliva of a rabid host, days to weeks before overt morbidity and eventual demise, entering the peripheral nervous system of a bite recipient.\nIn vivo, from local depots and centripetal transit in the axoplasm, primary replication occurs within neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Thereafter, centrifugal passage occurs from the CNS to a number of highly innervated sites, including the salivary glands. Oral, mucosal, or transdermal delivery of virions occurs by normal daily mammalian interactions. Failing these routine modus operandi pathways, altered unusual behaviors offer a variety of options for secondary contacts. These may range from mania to paresis and paralysis, with deliberate transmission options of agonistic encounters and biting, increased movement outside of normal home range/territories, or acute death, with predation by others upon virion-laden tissues and organs of the affected host. If a productive infection ensues, the entry-reproduction-exit cycle is poised to begin anew after initiation, taking days, weeks, months, or (rarely) years of incubation before excretion or obvious clinical manifestation. Such obligate, parasitic virions ensure elegant self-transfer by exploitation of the normal through to the bizarre. Relatively distant viral familial relatives hail among invertebrates and plants, but warm-blooded vertebrates are the rabies-prone hosts. Although these agents predated\nHomo sapiens, their current distribution, abundance, and diversity likely exceed pre-historic comparisons, especially mediated during the Anthropocene period.",

Within the Mammalia, a virtual alphabet soup of cases has been recorded, from the armadillo to the zebra. Rabies is a significant disease of domestic and wild mammals alike, yet its zoonotic aspect is the cause of major historical infamy. Few and privileged were the civilizations that did not describe the ravages of an entity akin to rabies, such that this infection has impacted art, literature, and cultural practices for millennia. By one small measure, during the time taken by a typical reader to peruse this article, more than 1,300 people will have been exposed to rabies virus (RABV). Annually, tens of thousands of persons will succumb, the majority children. Most are poor, have no access to modern medical care, and will die unreported, frequently at home in a rural village. If among other scales\u2014on the basis of disability-adjusted life-year scores or health economic measures\u2014rabies ranks within the top-ten list of neglected viral zoonoses, one would anticipate that the degree of philanthropic input would be roughly equivalent among such pathogens. Unfortunately, such is not the case. For example, several other neglected viral diseases may have a somewhat smaller presumed impact yet receive far greater attention for international support (\nTable 1). Not rooted entirely in science, a more holistic transdisciplinary philosophy assists in a better partial understanding of why such biomedical disparities persist between need and assistance, provoking a bootstraps approach in the field out of frustrated necessity in the face of apparent contradictions.",

Management, control, prevention, elimination, eradication, and so on are often freely bandied about together in today\u2019s lexicon of disease deliberations but are not synonymous terms. Unlike smallpox or rinderpest, rabies is not a candidate for actual eradication today, given the extent of host breadth and diversity. However, rabies has at least three major attributes in common with those other two extinct viral pathogens: validated diagnostic protocols, safe and effective vaccines, and the epidemiological insight to apply those laboratory tools and licensed biologics for sound prevention and control practices. Somewhat paradoxically, based upon a century of experience, modern rabies management accomplishes, in a truly One Health capacity, what no other comparable zoonosis program can achieve in tandem: human cases prevented by avoiding defined exposure and seeking prophylaxis after exposure; primary canine and secondary species infections eliminated, by mass immunization; and significantly, wild carnivore viral perpetuation interrupted via oral vaccination efforts on a landscape scale. Building upon such apparent progress, this review aims to provoke renewed discussions on several of the current issues and challenges related to modern lyssavirus taxonomy, phylogeny, surveillance, prevention, treatment, control, and elimination, based in part upon the opinions of the authors, representing more than a century of collective person-years of introspective knowledge, skills, and abilities in the field\u2014not as an historical aside alone, but rather within the context of evidence from the peer-reviewed literature, focusing upon relevant publications primarily within the past few years\n1\u2013\n115.

            "text": "Recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) moved toward a partial appropriation of binomial species nomenclature, which exists in other fields of taxonomy. However, the ICTV applied such naming inversely, so the genus name appears after the species name\n2. An objective rationale for this change is somewhat difficult to fathom unless the ICTV is trying to underline the fact that \u201creal\u201d virions and the concept of viruses and viral species are totally different entities. Although virions are observed by electron microscopy, no one has ever seen a \u201cvirus\u201d. Virions are particulate, whereas viruses are conceptual populations of microorganisms, and more so virus species are \u201cpolythetic classes\u201d (or fabricated \u201ccontainers\u201d) in which certain agents are placed artificially on the basis of their genetic, morphological, and physio-chemical properties\n3. In other fields of biology, one would use the scientific name of an organism as the synonym for its species, but in virus taxonomy this is not the case. For example, now RABV belongs to the type species of the\nLyssavirus genus, termed\nRabies lyssavirus. So speaking in general of the virus as an organism, one still uses the former, whereas the latter is employed in a taxonomic context only. Inherited operational difficulties of use\u2014for example, RABV (a virus) but\nRabies lyssavirus (a species); Mokola virus (a virus) but\nMokola lyssavirus (a species) and so on, also noting that virus names, but not species names, can be abbreviated\u2014may lead to further changes of this binomial nomenclature in future years\n4.",

Phylogroup I includes\nRabies lyssavirus,\nAravan lyssavirus,\nAustralian bat lyssavirus,\nBokeloh lyssavirus,\nDuvenhage lyssavirus,\nEuropean bat lyssaviruses,\ntype 1 and\ntype 2,\nIrkut lyssavirus,\nKhujand lyssavirus, and the new Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus. Phylogroup II includes\nLagos bat lyssavirus,\nMokola lyssavirus, and\nShimoni bat lyssavirus. The remaining\nWest Caucasian bat lyssavirus,\nIkoma lyssavirus, and Lleida bat lyssavirus are not included in either phylogroup. Although phylogenetically they do appear related, the amount of genetic divergence and absence of cross-neutralization do not allow placement in a single phylogroup on the basis of existing demarcation criteria\n8. Genetic distances between lyssaviruses from different species are significantly shorter than those in other rhabdovirus genera. Therefore, other characters, such as antigenic reactivity patterns with monoclonal antibodies and ecologic properties (including distribution and host range), are used imperfectly for demarcation between the viral species\n9. This demarcation is based on expert opinion of a well-qualified taxonomic study group. With increasing ICTV debate toward unification of virus taxonomy based on genetic distances, in the near future there may be a re-classification attempt, in which all phylogroup I viruses are segregated into one species (for example,\nRabies lyssavirus?) and all phylogroup II viruses are segregated into another. Of course, such re-classification would miss important characteristics used for species demarcation at present and may have potential socio-economic or bio-political consequences for certain areas. For example, some places where RABV is not thought to circulate, such as in Australia or Western Europe (but where other lyssaviruses are present among bats), might lose their self-defined \u201crabies-free\u201d status, on the basis of viral taxonomic re-organization, creating greater confusion, with potential public health, veterinary, or economic repercussions, if suddenly recast into the same disease status as Africa, Asia and the New World. Arguably, the term \u201crabies\u201d appears to garner greater weight and seriousness than the less familiar designation \u201cbat lyssavirus\u201d.",

In general, evolutionary rates observed in a set of sequences exhibit time dependency and are increased toward the present because of the transient mutations yet to be removed by purifying selection. Therefore, substitution rates estimated during long time frames will be lower systematically than those obtained during short time frames. This effect is as strong as, or stronger than, purifying selection, which shapes virus evolution\n25,\n26,\n27. In other words, timescale estimations based on substitution rates are useful only for the time frame encompassed by the sampling period but cannot be extrapolated easily for longer periods of time.",

            "text": "Present distributions, diversity and compartmentalization of lyssaviruses, and the empiric observation of viral genome conservation reveal great contrast to the suggested recent age of their MRCA. If one entertains that the published suggested timescale estimates of lyssaviruses are fallacious, restricted by analysis of limited sets of available isolates, one can use several other lines of evidence to hypothesize their origin and longer-term evolution. All the diversity of lyssaviruses is represented in bats (except for MOKV and IKOV, for which the reservoir hosts are yet to be established definitively), whereas carnivores maintain perpetuation of several lineages of RABV only. As such, it is commonly accepted that bats are the primary evolutionary hosts of lyssaviruses\n8,\n12,\n28. Lyssaviruses of multiple species (with the notable exception of RABV) circulate in Old World bats, but only RABV circulates in New World bats. Furthermore, RABV lineages present in New World bats, along with a few lineages circulating in skunks and raccoons (the so-called \u201cindigenous American\u201d RABV), are paraphyletic to the RABV lineages circulating in carnivores in the Old World and to the \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d canine lineage, which (as believed) was dispersed worldwide with human migrations across the globe\n29. Nevertheless, all RABV lineages are monophyletic when compared with lyssaviruses of other species and demonstrate a greater sequence identity between each other than to lyssaviruses of other species\n30. From this evidence, it is tempting to speculate that an ancient RABV ancestor (already distinct from lyssaviruses of other species) circulated in early bats in the territory of Gondwana, as bats presumably originated in the region of modern Africa\n31. A bat morphologically similar to extant bats,\nOnychonycteris, lived about 52.5 million years ago\n32. Other related species might have existed earlier. Molecular inferences suggested that the MRCA of present bats existed at least 80 million years ago, potentially pushing bat origins into the Cretaceous period\n31,\n33. Such an ancient chiropteran origin of RABV might explain the existence of the independently evolved \u201cindigenous American\u201d virus lineage and the absence of similar RABVs in related bat species between the Americas and the Old World (for example, in\nMyotis spp. and\nEptesicus spp.). South America and Africa split from each other between 100 and 84 million years ago and were separated by the South Atlantic Ocean. Ancient bats are hypothesized to have spread from Africa to South America slightly later, via island hopping or direct intercontinental flight\n31. Perhaps, at that time, bats were already infected with a progenitor of the \u201cindigenous American\u201d RABV (\nFigure 2). This virus might be well adapted to bat hosts (for example, owing to substitutions such as S\n242 in the viral G protein) and compartmentalized in numerous bat species, such as the indigenous phyllostomatids, across the Americas, with a later host shift to other bat species, skunks, and raccoons. Phylogenetic analysis suggested rapid diversification of bats, with all families having evolved before the late Eocene epoch\n31, and the same might be true for the viruses that co-evolved with their hosts, followed by millions of years characterized by stasis and slow genetic drift under constraints of purifying selection. Possibly, RABV lineages that continued to evolve in the Old World did not obtain such favorable substitutions and could not colonize multiple bat species as in the Americas but rather switched to carnivores as a comparatively recent event. Of course, this hypothesis does not explain the absence of RABV in Old World bats. However, given the less-than-ideal level of surveillance in the Old World tropics, it is possible that bat RABV does exist there but is undiscovered. Considering that four new lyssaviruses were described during the last decade (including Bokeloh bat lyssavirus in Western Europe, where surveillance is quite adequate) and that the most recent of these, Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus, was described in Sri Lanka in 2016 only\n6, one should expect further discoveries of lyssaviruses in the Old World. The absence of non-RABV lyssaviruses in the Americas can be explained at least in part by the fact that even at present these viruses have a limited geographic distribution and host ranges compared with RABV. If these characteristics were similar in the past, such viruses might not spread to the territory of the present Americas once Africa and South America drifted further apart (\nFigure 2).",

Pre-exposure vaccination is highly efficacious for those at risk of exposure, such as veterinarians, laboratory workers, and certain travelers\n46,\n47. After exposure, the prompt and proper application of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)\u2014consisting of wound care, infiltration of rabies immune globulin (RIG), and administration of modern rabies vaccines\u2014virtually ensures survival\n48. Nevertheless, the majority of persons at risk do not receive pre-exposure vaccination and most RABV-exposed patients are never provided adequate PEP. This discrepancy between Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices/World Health Organization (ACIP/WHO) recommendations and reality has sparked strong debate and translational research for more novel, less expensive products; simplified schedules; and improved ease of use\n49\u2013\n58. Outstanding questions for resolution include the following: Can PEP be performed safely without RIG (given that limited availability means more than 90% of persons do not receive it)? Are heterologous (for example, equine) RIG products equivalent to human RIG in regard to safety and effectiveness? If so, how should their production be increased? Is the dose of RIG critical in terms of international units per kilograms or is local infiltration more important, regardless of absolute dose? Does administration of vaccine directly into exposure sites improve survivorship if RIG is not available? Could PEP completion be reduced to one week or less? What is the role for rabies pre-exposure vaccine inclusion into childhood schedules? When will GAVI add human rabies vaccine to its portfolio? Will monoclonal antibodies help to resolve the issues with RIG availability and distribution? Should new biologics be developed to increase the breadth of reactivity against non-phylogroup I lyssaviruses? Is there a role for new adjuvants or attenuated RABV vaccines to obviate the need for RIG? Should genes involved in the innate immune response (for example, interferons) be incorporated into genomes of recombinant RABV vaccine strains? Although the field will always profit from relevant advances, much attention is often spent on academic research on new biologics and less on translational research for the appropriate use of existing products and protocols to prevent rabies now (\nTable 3).",

Cumulatively, since the 1970s, reports of very rare, non-fatal human cases (most with a history of vaccination) and the occasional spontaneous \u201csurvivor\u201d during animal rabies studies suggested that clinical rabies may not always end in death, prompting the administration of aggressive anti-viral therapy\n60. As a case in point, in 2004, a Wisconsin teenager bitten by a bat became the first unvaccinated survivor after intensive medical care, coma induction, and administration of anti-viral drugs\n61. Over the next decade, few additional survivors who received the \u201cMilwaukee protocol\u201d were added to the registry (\nhttp://www.mcw.edu/Pediatrics/InfectiousDiseases/PatientCare/Rabies.htm). Nevertheless, the drive to act is understandable; such undertakings are compassionate and heroic attempts at treating the incurable.

Although there has been sharp debate over the dangers of therapeutic coma and the merits of the Milwaukee protocol, the often-heated discussion has reinvigorated the field in a direction toward consideration of potential treatment administered to the patient with rabies\n62. Asklepios is but one example of such a renaissance by a consortium of scientists whose focal research aims include the following: the identification of drugs that would inhibit RABV replication, the testing of molecules that may minimize detrimental host responses during RABV infection, the determination of whether alteration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability could improve treatment effectiveness, and validation of the potential success for such an approach\nin vivo (\nhttp://asklepiosfp7.eu/). Regardless of technical insights, required expertise, the associated expense and related ethics of effort issues, there is also the prospect of survivorship with sequelae and the need for lengthy, potentially lifelong, rehabilitation and quality-of-life considerations\n63. To make progress, whether in veterinary or human medicine, a more complete approach to rabies treatment should be taken, combining insights on rabies pathobiology gleaned from both experimental animal research and individual human case studies\n64. Excellent clinical care by a dream team of specialists, anti-viral drugs incorporated from other RNA virus research, targeted immune modulation, the tincture of time, and a healthy dose of luck for appreciable self-cure in a patient with the ideal age, genetic pre-disposition, and clinical staging parameters may offer future hope to a more prescriptive treatment of rabies (\nTable 4).",

To prevent rabies in humans, manufacturers from the Northern Hemisphere and an increasing number of producers from emerging markets (for example, China and India) produce enough vaccine annually to deliver approximately 28 million rabies PEP courses in dog rabies-enzootic countries of Africa, Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region, preventing nearly 98% of human rabies deaths. Unfortunately, easier access to rabies vaccine, particularly in urban centers of Africa and Asia, has been accompanied by an increasing proportion of PEP (sometimes up to 70%) administered to people who are not at high risk of developing rabies, necessitating greater education and outreach to the public and professionals alike\n70. Such issues are not uncommon in Europe and North America, where human rabies caused by dogs has been eliminated.",

Objectives were to discuss forecasting needs, vaccine and RIG quality, and funding and procurement issues, and to estimate quantities of human and dog vaccines needed in the medium and long term at both the country and regional level\n74. During this meeting, manufacturers of canine rabies vaccines stated that production capacity shortages were not an issue and that output could be increased easily should accurate, financially supported, medium-term vaccine forecasts become available. However, current annual production capacities of major manufacturers are estimated to be near 100 million doses, and maximum capacity is about 150 million doses\n75. This rabies vaccine production is meant to satisfy the most profitable Northern Hemisphere (for example, USA, Canada, and Western and Eastern Europe) markets, where there are about 170 million owned dogs, whereas only a small share of the 411 million owned and community dogs are vaccinated each year in the defined WHO African, Asian, Eurasian, and Middle Eastern regions (\nTable 5). The vaccine requirements of Latin American countries, where dog-mediated human rabies has almost been eliminated (mostly through dog rabies immunization), are estimated at about 42 million doses annually and often are covered largely by local manufacturers based in Mexico and Brazil\n76,\n77. Together, dog rabies-enzootic countries of Central Asia belonging to the European (EU), South-East-Asian (SEA), and Western Pacific (WP) WHO regions account in nearly equal proportions for almost 74% of the total number of canine vaccine doses used.

Theories on lyssavirus and host co-evolution will be complemented by methodological improvements and pathogen discovery. With enhanced, de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance and focused detection efforts, additional lyssavirus species and host shifts are expected. Stockpiling of vaccine and RIG, attention to existing recommendations, and careful risk assessments will increase the use of pre-exposure vaccination, maximize appropriate use of biologics in those truly exposed, and reduce PEP failures. Eventual application of the growing knowledge base on rabies pathogenetic mechanisms, pronounced intensive clinical skills in managing encephalitis, and the abilities to intervene with combinations of biologics and anti-viral drugs will gradually result in additional rabies survivors in human and veterinary medicine without losing the critical focus upon disease prevention. Ideally, under a progressive global business plan (with the minimum application of estimated biologics to the populations at risk, new champions, and dedicated sponsorships without vaccination fatigue), human rabies mediated by dogs should be eliminated in Latin America over the next 5 years, in Asia within a decade, and in Africa by 2030. Although eradication is not the aim, given a diversity of wildlife reservoirs and a lack of strategies to break the chain of perpetuation among the Chiroptera, the time is long overdue to accomplish such other ambitious goals against an ancient and insidious but neglected killer.",
