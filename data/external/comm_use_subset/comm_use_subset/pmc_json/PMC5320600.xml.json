The method is widely applicable to aid in generation of hypotheses for experimental work and to pinpoint plausible candidates for further study and data acquisition.

However, the pace of sequence accumulation generally exceeds the pace of experimental studies of protein function. This relationship holds not only for recently emerged pathogens (Cotten et al., 2013; Gire et al., 2014), but also for intensively studied pathogens, such as influenza (Gong & Bloom, 2014; Worobey et al., 2014). Tools to analyse such large datasets and provide targeted guidance in inferring phenotypically meaningful groups can therefore be useful to identify amino acid sites and proteins that play critical roles in pathogen biology and evolution. These sites are potential targets for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.",

When the datasets comprise hundreds to thousands of sequences, trees become increasingly crowded and identifying meaningful information is difficult. In contrast, basic statistical procedures such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering or k-means (Hastie et al., 2009) can provide a compressed view into the data with relative ease. However, the use of such unfocused methods for extracting information is problematic when the biologically relevant signals are masked by noise introduced due to sequencing errors or functionally neutral variation. This is the situation for fast-evolving organisms where many changes rapidly accumulate across proteins but only a subset of them actually show signs of selection.",

For microbial proteins one important question is which isolates or strains constitute phenotypically distinct groups, distinguished by specific amino acids fixed by selection. It is also useful to know which positions and amino acids are probably directly under selection. Statistically, these questions correspond to the task of simultaneously clustering a protein sequence alignment in two ways, by the rows to identify the relevant groups of strains and by the columns to identify which amino acid positions define the clusters. As both the number of groups and the relevant sequence positions are often unknown, statistical inference is required. Bayesian modelling is particularly well suited for such model selection problems, as by specifying probabilistic prior information for the unknowns in the model, one can efficiently focus the search and avoid overfitting.",

Our approach is based on a two-way clustering model inspired by an earlier method (K-Pax) for clustering single protein sequence alignments from distant homologues to identify substructure within a protein superfamily (Marttinen et al., 2006). Our current method possesses two significant improvements over the original K-Pax, one related to accuracy and the other to the technical specifications of the priors and model. These changes permit the method to be used to study a large number of closely related sequences as well as several proteins simultaneously. A useful feature of our model definition is that it enables an analytically obtainable Bayesian score of model fitness. This feature permits the use of parallel computation in model optimization, as the scores are directly comparable from independent optimization runs without approximation errors caused by, for example, Monte Carlo methods.",

However, there is also evidence of positive selection at CD4+ and CD8+T-cell epitopes (Suzuki, 2006) and for the addition of N-linked glycosylation sites (Suzuki, 2011).

We assume that the non-synonymous mutations that do not induce fitness changes will occur at a constant rate throughout the population. This can be translated into the statistical approximation that for the n sampled strains, functional neutrality corresponds to a fixed probability of observing a particular residue in a given sequence position across all the K clusters:for all i \u2208  wk and for all , K. Thus, from the clustering perspective, any column  in X is considered as \u2018noise\u2019 if the above probability is constant across groups. Conversely, we define a column j to represent a putative \u2018selection signal\u2019 if there are at least two groups for which the corresponding probability is different:for all i \u2208  wk, and i\u2032 \u2208  wk\u2032 and for some k \u2260  k\u2032. Such signals are only putative, as random drift could still explain a difference in the residue composition between two clusters. In addition, more rigid probabilistic restrictions must be imposed on the model structure to ensure that the grouping W and the identities of the selected sites become jointly identifiable and convey a biologically meaningful extraction of information from the alignment S. Note that residues that remain unchanged in the whole virus population over long periods of time ostensibly due to strict functional constraints on the protein structure are also uninformative for the purpose of identification of sequence clusters, as they correspond to fully conserved sites in the alignment S.",

For a discrete posterior distribution over a space of such high cardinality and complex topology, it is unlikely that any standard Markov chain Monte Carlo approach would be able to efficiently explore the distribution and estimate the mode using a reasonable amount of computational time. Therefore, we have developed a greedy optimization algorithm for fitting the model to a multiple sequence alignment. An advantage of the analytical tractability of the model is that any two model structures can be compared using the difference in log posterior, and hence estimates from multiple independent parallel or sequential algorithm runs can be ranked in a straightforward manner. Similarly, posterior uncertainty around the mode estimate can be easily numerically summarized, for example using Bayes factors against neighbouring model configurations.",

This reflects the dominant role of the B-cell epitopes in contrast to T-cell epitopes (Suzuki, 2006). To quantify the distribution of these changes over time, we calculated unadjusted estimates of mutation rates in each epitope and elsewhere in HA1 (Table 1). Antigenic drift is thought to occur when an average of four amino acid changes accumulates over time (Koel et al., 2013). Many of the cluster transitions in Fig. 5 agree with this definition, but some carry fewer substitutions, which illustrates the usefulness of more flexible, statistical model-based rules to pinpoint potential targets for further attention and experimental work. The inferred changes are not uniformly distributed over the five epitopes (chi-squared test, \u03c72 = 19.665, df = 4, P < 0.001); instead changes in epitopes B and A are over-represented (in decreasing order), which matches well with current understanding of their relative functional importance (Koel et al., 2013).",

Video S1 displays the characteristic amino acid changes in core clusters mapped to the 3D structure of HA. The most comprehensive transition occurs in the 1996 group where changes occurred in all five epitopes, shown as a pronounced jump in antigenic space (Fig. 6). Interestingly, sequential changes in core characteristic sites rarely occur in close proximity, even when within the same epitope. This raises the possibility that selection tends to favour alternation across the protein surface, even within a single domain. Such patterns are consistent with the idea that HA evades immunity through sequential mutations that enable escape from different subpopulations (Linderman et al., 2014; Sato et al., 2004).",

Like most statistical methods, the model-based clustering can be affected by sampling biases of various kinds. Highly uneven sampling over space and time will both reduce the power to detect novel variants and inflate the false positive rate of functionally critical residue changes. Furthermore, certain evolutionary processes such as episodic selection can create a pattern that resembles those implied by positive selection, and hence the inferred clusters may lack meaningful interpretation in phenotype space. Furthermore, hitchhiking phenomena due to genetic linkage may confound the identification of the causal variants as characteristic sites.",
