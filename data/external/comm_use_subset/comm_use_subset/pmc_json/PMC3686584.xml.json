The PA value (PFU/mL) equivalence, when compared to ICC-RT-qPCR values (GC/mL) immediately after the concentration of water samples and after a series of decimal dilutions (100 to 10-8), is shown in Figure 1. The average equivalence of a PFU unit for GC was 3.4 logs, which means that 102 PFU is equivalent to 105 GC.

Our findings corroborate those of other studies that reported the prevalence of HAdV-2 in the aquatic environment and in stool samples [34-36].
