This process is catalyzed by intracellular poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) also known as diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTDs), although extracellular cholera toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTCs) and some sirtuins also catalyze ADP-ribosylation [1]. Humans encode 17 PARPs, while mice encode 16. Four (PARP1, PARP2, PARP5a, and PARP5b) are PARylating, while the rest are MARylating or nonenzymatic [2]. Like many post-translational modifications, ADP-ribosylation is reversible by enzymes such as poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), ADP-ribosylhydrolases (ARHs), and macrodomains [3\u20137].",

For instance, PARylating PARPs, such as PARP1/2 and PARP5a/b regulate several nuclear processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and Wnt pathway activation [9, 10]. Mono-ADP-ribosylating PARPs also play a variety of roles in cell biology. For example, PARP16 is required for activation of ER-stress pathways [11], PARP14 binds to STAT-6 and enhances IL-4-dependent gene expression [12\u201315], PARP9 augments IFN\u03b3-dependent gene expression in macrophages [15], and an unknown ADP-ribosylating enzyme inhibits RNAi following stress responses or poly(I:C) treatment [16\u201318]. In addition, two sirtuins, SIRT4 and SIRT6, use ADP-ribosylation to inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase and promote DNA repair respectively [19, 20].",

            "text": "PARPs have evolved rapidly, which may reflect their involvement in virus infections [21, 22]. Consistent with this, several PARPs are known ISGs (interferon stimulated genes), and many PARPs have been shown to be antiviral. PARP13, also called zinc antiviral protein (ZAP), inhibits replication of multiple classes of viruses, including retroviruses [23, 24], alphaviruses [22, 25, 26], and filoviruses [27] by binding to viral RNA and recruiting the RNA-degrading exosome complex [28]. ZAP was also found to be required for the ADP-ribosylation and subsequent degradation of influenza A virus proteins PA and PB2 despite being catalytically inactive [29]. Atasheva et al. demonstrated that exogenous expression of PARPs 7, 10, and 12 had inhibitory effects on protein translation and on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) virus replication using ADP-ribosylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms [30]. This group and others demonstrated that PARP12 could also inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [31, 32]. PARP12 has been further shown to restrict Zika virus replication by promoting the degradation of viral proteins in an ADP-ribosylation-dependent manner [33]. PARP9 has been shown to complex with the DTX3L ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate the host histone H2BJ to enhance IFN signaling, resulting in the inhibition of RNA virus replication [34]. This complex also targets the EMCV 3C protease for ubiquitination and degradation [34]. While PARP9 was important for these activities, whether its ADP-ribosylating activity is required is unclear. In other cases, ADP-ribosylation is important for efficient virus replication as PARP1 inhibitors restrict the replication of several viruses such as herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and HIV [35\u201337]. PARP7 has both anti- and pro-viral activities as it binds to and induces degradation of Sindbis virus RNA [30, 38] but also promotes influenza A virus infection by ADP-ribosylating TBK1, which inhibits type I IFN (IFN-I) production [39]. Finally, sirtuins 1\u20137, including the ADP-ribosylating sirtuins SIRT4 and SIRT6, were shown to inhibit the replication of a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses in MRC-5 cells [18]. However, the mechanism of viral inhibition by sirtuins and whether ADP-ribosylation is involved remains unknown.",

Recombinant alphaviruses and hepatitis E virus (HEV) with mutations in these residues generally do not replicate well, while macrodomain-mutant coronaviruses generally replicate normally in tissue culture cells but are highly attenuated in vivo [40, 41, 44\u201350].

Some, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine delta coronavirus, cause severe disease in agriculturally important animals, while others, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, cause lethal human diseases [51]. Mouse hepatitis virus strain JHMV (termed MHV herein) causes acute and chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis and is the prototypical CoV used in many studies [52]. CoVs maintain several proteins that are important for blocking the innate immune response, including enzymes such as an O-methyltransferase (nsp-(nonstructural protein)16), a deubiquitinase (DUB) (nsp3), an endoribonuclease (nsp15), and an ADP-ribosylhydrolase, the aforementioned macrodomain (nsp3) [53\u201357]. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV macrodomain-mutant virus was shown to induce a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine response following infection both in vitro and in vivo [40]. In addition, SARS-CoV and human CoV 229E macrodomain-mutant viruses had increased sensitivity to IFN-I treatment in cell culture, demonstrating that the CoV macrodomain counters antiviral activities of ISGs [48]. Together, these studies suggest that IFN-stimulated ADP-ribosylation is countered by the conserved CoV macrodomain. Here, we show that PARP inhibitors specifically enhance the replication of MHV and decrease IFN production during macrodomain-mutant virus infection, further implicating the macrodomain in countering IFN-induced PARP-mediated antiviral ADP-ribosylation.",

The location of the macrodomain within nsp3 of MHV and the specific location of this mutation have been previously reported [40, 58]. This asparagine residue is present in all enzymatically active macrodomains, and the asparagine-to-alanine mutation either reduces (CHIKV, HEV) or abolishes (SARS-CoV) the ADP-ribosyl hydrolase activity of viral macrodomains [40\u201342]. Structurally, the location of this residue within the protein is highly conserved among CoV macrodomains and appears to coordinate the 2\u2019 OH of the distal ribose to influence ADP-ribose binding, catalysis, or both [59, 60].",

To directly assess replication of the mutant virus in macrophages in vivo, we purified CD11b+ cells (80\u201390% purity, S1A Fig) from the brains of mice infected with wild-type (WT) or N1347A MHV containing eGFP in place of ORF4 [50]. Of note, ORF4 is not required for optimal virus replication in vitro or in vivo [62]. Herein, WT virus refers to the previously described revN1347 virus where the WT macrodomain sequence was reinserted into the N1347A MHV BAC clone [50]. Similar to results found in whole brain [50], N1347A virus replication, measured by viral genomic RNA (gRNA) content, was reduced compared to that of WT virus in isolated brain CD11b+ cells (S1B Fig). Because the macrodomain is predicted to counter PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation, we also analyzed whether PARP expression changed after infection. Consistent with a role for ADP-ribosylation, several PARPs were highly upregulated in these cells following infection with either WT or N1347A virus (S1C Fig).",

To this end, we harvested murine bone marrow cells, differentiated them into macrophages, and infected these BMDMs with WT and N1347A virus at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Fig 1). At 20 hours post infection (hpi), BMDMs infected with N1347A virus had >10-fold lower titers and gRNA levels than those infected with WT virus (Fig 1A and 1B). Furthermore, total viral protein levels were noticeably decreased in N1347A virus-infected cells when measured by immunoblotting for nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig 1C) or by visually analyzing virus-encoded GFP expression and syncytia formation by fluorescence microscopy (Fig 1D). Unfortunately, the large syncytia formed by infected cells made quantitative flow cytometric analysis of GFP-expressing cells unfeasible.",

            "text": "To determine if restriction of N1347A MHV replication is due to mechanisms upstream or downstream of IFN-I signaling, we infected BMDMs isolated from WT, MAVS-/- (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein), and IFNAR-/- (interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor) mice with WT and N1347A MHV. Loss of MAVS or IFNAR greatly reduced IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels compared to those in WT cells (Fig 2A). Furthermore, the N1347A MHV-mediated increase in IFN\u03b2 mRNA seen in WT cells was ablated in MAVS-/- cells (Fig 2A). However, while the replication deficiency of N1347A virus in WT BMDMs was retained in MAVS-/- cells, it was largely rescued in IFNAR-/- cells as measured by genomic RNA levels, viral titers, and visualized by GFP expression (Fig 2B\u20132D). To determine if these in vitro findings correlate with virulence, we infected WT, MAVS-/-, and IFNAR-/- mice intranasally with WT and N1347A virus (S2 Fig). N1347 virus-infected WT and MAVS-/- mice exhibited 100% survival and minimal differences in weight loss. In contrast, 60% of IFNAR-/- mice infected with N1347A virus succumbed to the infection and exhibited weight loss similar to that induced by WT virus. To further confirm that the factor(s) limiting N1347A MHV replication is downstream of IFN-I, we pretreated WT BMDMs with different doses of IFN\u03b2 for 8 hours and then infected cells with WT or N1347A virus (Fig 2E). Increasing amounts of IFN\u03b2 further reduced N1347A virus titers compared to that of WT, demonstrating that ISGs restrict N1347A MHV replication.",

            "text": "The macrodomain is an ADP-ribosylhydrolase, raising the possibility that PARP enzymes are responsible for the attenuation of the N1347A virus. PARPs are known ISGs, and the lack of upregulation of these proteins in IFNAR-/- cells or mice could explain the restoration of N1347A MHV-specific phenotypes. First, we determined whether PARPs were upregulated during infection by measuring PARP mRNA levels in BMDMs infected with WT and N1347A virus (Fig 3A). Several PARP family members, including PARPs 7 and 9\u201314, were upregulated in both WT and N1347A virus-infected BMDMs compared to mock-infected cells. Of note, our PARP13 primers were designed to detect all isoforms of PARP13, and we were unable to detect PARP2 or PARP6. Furthermore, the expression of these upregulated PARPs were also increased in infected MAVS-/- cells, while the expression of PARPs 9\u201312 and 14 were not increased in infected IFNAR-/- cells (Fig 3B), suggesting these PARPs are ISGs, consistent with previous reports [31, 32, 63, 64]. We confirmed this by treating WT and IFNAR-/- BMDMs with IFN\u03b2 and measuring PARP mRNA levels (Fig 3C). As expected, PARPs 9\u201312 and 14, in addition to PARPs 3, 4, and 5a, were upregulated following IFN\u03b2 stimulation in WT but not in IFNAR-/- BMDMs, consistent with previous studies [31, 65]. Interestingly, PARP7 and PARP13 were induced by IFN\u03b2 but were also induced in infected IFNAR-/- cells, demonstrating that, while these PARPs are ISGs, they are also regulated by additional mechanisms during infection (Fig 3B and 3C). We conclude that most PARPs are ISGs in primary murine macrophages and that PARPs 7 and 9\u201314 are highly expressed following CoV infection.",

These inhibitors did not affect cell growth or metabolism at the concentration used in this study but diminished cellular PARylation, demonstrating efficacy (S3A & S3C Fig). Importantly, both inhibitors significantly increased N1347A virus replication compared to vehicle treatment as visualized by GFP expression or measured by viral titers or genomic RNA levels (Fig 4A\u20134C). Further, levels of IFN\u03b2 transcript produced in N1347A virus-infected cells treated with inhibitors were reduced to levels seen in WT virus-infected cells (Fig 4D). Importantly, neither inhibitor had a significant effect on replication or IFN production in WT virus-infected cells, suggesting that PARPs are potentially counteracted by macrodomain activity during WT infection. As these inhibitors are known to target the PARP catalytic site [66], these data indicate that PARP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is responsible for decreased replication and increased IFN\u03b2 production during N1347A MHV infection.",

We were unable to reliably knockdown PARP13 expression, so this PARP was excluded from our analysis. Knockdown of all other tested PARP mRNAs in both WT and N1347A MHV-infected BMDMs was observed (S4 Fig). Knockdown of PARPs 7, 9, 10, and 11 did not significantly increase WT or N1347A virus gRNA levels over that of control siRNA-transfected N1347A virus-infected cells (Fig 5A, top row). In contrast, two independent siRNAs directed toward PARP12 and PARP14 significantly rescued N1347A virus gRNA levels without having a significant effect on WT virus (Fig 5A, bottom row). Viral titers were also increased in cells transfected with siPARP12.2 or with siPARP14.1, although the increased replication of N1347A virus in PARP14 knockdown cells did not reach statistical significance (Fig 5B). To further examine the role of PARP14 in N1347A MHV infection, we infected BMDMs harvested from PARP14-/- and PARP14+/- mice (S5 Fig). N1347A virus replication was not significantly different in PARP14-/- and PARP14+/- cells (Fig 5C), suggesting that other PARPs or factors important for restricting replication may have compensated for or were lacking in the congenital absence of PARP14. In an effort to resolve these differences, we utilized a recently developed PARP14 inhibitor, compound 8K, which targets the MARylating catalytic site of PARP14 (Fig 5D) [67]. While compound 8K did not affect cell viability or metabolism or inhibit global cellular PARylation (S3B & S3C Fig), it significantly restored replication of N1347A virus in BMDMs (Fig 5E). In general, these results support a role for PARP12 and PARP14 in blocking N1347A MHV replication. However, whether or not the catalytic domain of PARP12 is required for this role will require further validation.",

Consistent with these results, PARP14-/- in contrast to PARP14+/- cells showed no increase in IFN expression following infection with N1347A virus (Fig 6B). Notably, overexpression of PARP14, but not of GFP, was also sufficient for IFN induction in delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells, which normally express very low, if any, IFN (Figs 6C & S6). Overexpression of a PARP14 mutant with inactivating mutations H1698F, Y1730N, and E1810K in the catalytic triad of the PARP domain (CM, described in [68]) also induced IFN expression in DBT cells following transfection (Fig 6C).

We engineered six PARP14 knockout (KO) clones of A549 cells and a pool of PARP14 KO cells in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) using lentiCRISPR/CAS9-v2 (Figs 6D & S7A). These cells were transfected with poly(I:C) for 6 hours, at which point the supernatant (conditioned media) was collected and transferred to na\u00efve A549 cells. After a 2-hour incubation, we then infected these cells with an eGFP-expressing mutant recombinant VSV (VSV M51R) that is unable to suppress the innate immune response [69] and measured virus replication by plaque assay on Vero cells to quantify the amount of antiviral cytokines in the conditioned media (Fig 6E). As expected, treatment with conditioned media from poly(I:C)-transfected WT A549 (Fig 6F and 6G) or WT NHDF cells (S7B and S7C Fig) induced a substantial decrease in VSV M51R replication compared to media from mock-transfected cells. In contrast, conditioned media harvested from stimulated PARP14 KO A549 (Fig 6F and 6G) or PARP14 KO NHDF (S7B and S7C Fig) cells showed only partial antiviral activity, resulting in ~3-fold enhanced replication of VSV M51R compared to cells that received conditioned media from stimulated WT cells. To confirm the antiviral activity in the conditioned media is due to IFN-I, we engineered cells functionally knocked out for IFNAR1 and tested whether the conditioned media had any effects on VSV M51R replication in these cells. The addition of exogenous IFN\u03b1 to IFNAR KO A549 cells had no effect on VSV M51R replication, whereas 10 units of IFN\u03b1 restricted VSV replication in WT cells, confirming that the IFNAR KO cells were defective for IFN-I signaling (S7D Fig). Conditioned media from both WT and PARP14 KO cells treated with poly(I:C) still had a mild inhibitory effect on VSV M51R replication in IFNAR KO cells, suggesting that antiviral cytokines in addition to IFN-I were present in the media. However, a smaller difference in VSV replication between WT and PARP14 KO conditioned media-treated cells was observed in IFNAR KO recipient cells compared to WT recipient cells (Figs 6G and S7C), indicating that the primary antiviral factor produced by stimulated cells was IFN-I. Taken together, these data indicate that PARP14 is necessary for efficient IFN-I production during CoV infection and poly(I:C) stimulation in both mouse and human cells respectively.",

Previous reports have shown that CoVs were unable to cause disease in the absence of viral macrodomain ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity and that this attenuation was associated with reduced viral loads and changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in vivo [40, 47, 50]. However, it has been difficult to elucidate the details of CoV macrodomain function due to the lack of a cell culture system that recapitulates these phenotypes. Our results showed that BMDMs are useful for this purpose since N1347A MHV replicated poorly and induced a robust IFN response in these cells (Fig 1). BMDMs provide several advantages over other primary cells in that they are easily cultured, can be obtained in large numbers, have a fully functional innate immune response, and are productively infected by MHV [70].",

            "text": "PARPs have both antiviral and immunomodulatory roles [8]. Here we found that pan-PARP inhibitors both decreased IFN production and enhanced the replication of MHV lacking ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity but had no significant effect on WT virus (Fig 4). The antiviral properties of PARPS were dependent upon their ADP-ribosyltransferase activity since these inhibitors target the catalytic site of PARPs. These results suggest that the conserved CoV macrodomain functions to directly counter the activity of cellular PARP enzymes; however, this conclusion will require further validation. In addition, utilizing siRNA knockdown and a PARP14 specific inhibitor, we provide evidence that both PARP12 and PARP14 are necessary to restrict N1347A virus replication (Fig 5A, 5B and 5E). PARP12, which has high sequence similarity to PARP13 (ZAP), has previously been shown to block both cellular and viral protein translation and inhibit virus replication by both ADP-ribosylation dependent and independent mechanisms [30]. On the other hand, PARP14 was not previously shown to inhibit virus replication but rather was shown to modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses [15, 63, 68, 71]. Both proteins are known components of stress granules where they interact with a variety of proteins, including Argonaute 2 and PARP13 (ZAP) [16]. Interestingly, PARP14 was recently shown to ADP-ribosylate PARP13 in human cells [72]. It will be intriguing to determine: i) if PARP12 and PARP14 localize to stress granules during a CoV infection, ii) whether PARP13 is involved in restricting N1347A MHV replication, and iii) how these PARPs specifically impact the CoV lifecycle. Most important will be to identify those proteins that are ADP-ribosylated by PARPs and targeted by the macrodomain during infection to fully understand this important host-virus interaction. Since the macrodomain is a subunit within a large transmembrane viral protein (nsp3), it is likely that the targets for de-ADP-ribosylation are cellular proteins in close vicinity to nsp3. These include proteins located in replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) or other subcellular structures such as P-bodies or stress granules.",

These data are consistent with a recent report detailing a role for PARP14 in IFN-I induction following LPS stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells and BMDMs [63]. In that study, the absence of PARP14 did not affect IRF-3 translocation to the nucleus but rather altered histone modification and reduced pol II recruitment to specific ISG promoters in the nucleus. Consistent with these data, we also showed that PARP14 overexpression induced IFN-I transcription in DBT cells (Fig 6C). PARP14 with three inactivating mutations in the catalytic triad also induced IFN expression (Fig 6C), suggesting that PARP14 uses both ADP-ribose-dependent and independent mechanisms to regulate the IFN response during CoV infection. This result may not be surprising since a PARP14 fragment without the catalytic domain has been shown to activate STAT-6 dependent transcription, but the catalytic domain was required for maximal activation [12].",

Recently, several of these proteins have been demonstrated to be regulated by PARPs as well [13, 15, 39, 63, 75, 76]. These findings, along with our data, unveil previously unknown mechanisms of innate immune regulation and suggest that PARP-dependent ADP-ribosylation will impact several proteins in these pathways. Clearly, the next step will be to identify the targets of individual PARPs and determine precisely how ADP-ribosylation regulates the innate immune response.",
