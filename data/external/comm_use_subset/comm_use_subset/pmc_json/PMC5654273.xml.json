However, image quality is suboptimal and the radiation dose from 67Ga is high. The positron-emitter 68Ga allows PET imaging, which has a better spatial resolution and a higher detection efficiency than standard gamma-camera imaging. Furthermore, the shorter half-life of 68Ga (67.7 min versus 78 hours for 67Ga) reduces the radiation dose. In the body, the Ga3+ ion acts as an analogue of iron (Fe3+), associating with transferrin; for more details, see [7].

Methionine (natural or labelled) is transported into cells via the L-type amino acid transporter 1. It is crucial for the formation of proteins and is involved in the synthesis of phospholipids. The accumulation of methionine therefore reflects amino acid transport and protein synthesis. During cell replication, the demand for essential amino acids increases, as do protein and phospholipid synthesis. Although primarily used to detect malignant tumours [11], methionine is known from brain studies to accumulate in inflammatory tissue [12, 13]. Furthermore, a high uptake of [11C]methionine has been observed after acute myocardial infarction, indicating that this tracer may be a good marker of inflammatory reactions during the phase of tissue repair [14].",

The injection was performed into the right femoral artery, allowing for selective infection of this hind limb while leaving the contralateral left hind limb as a noninfected control. Osteomyelitis was allowed to develop for one week, after which the pig was scanned and then euthanized. If a pig reached predefined humane endpoints, it was then euthanized (and not scanned). A refinement of the model, combining reduced body weight of the pigs (from 40 kg to 20 kg) with administration of penicillin at the onset of the first clinical signs of disease, proved effective in reducing systemic infection [21].",

Using full FOV data ensures that the statistical noise is low. Restricting this fit to the early data has several advantages. First, this focuses on the part of the study where the input function changes fast and the delay therefore is important. Second, this means that physiological differences in uptake (e.g., bladder versus nonbladder, infection versus noninfection) will only have had little time to manifest; thus the full FOV data will be dominated by the bolus passage in this anatomical part of the animal, rather than by a mix of physiologies. Third, the possible metabolism effects will not yet dominate the input function, for which reason the uncorrected input function can be considered representative, even if the tracer over time is metabolized.",
