Many potential mechanisms have been suggested to explain the potential beneficial effect of Zn against virus infections. For example, Zn mediates antiviral effects through the inhibition of nidovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases or other proteins essential for the different phases of the viral life cycle [5,6]. In addition, Zn participates in initiating and maintaining robust immune responses, in particular cytokine production and modulation of the activity of immune cells [7]. Zn induces the production of innate interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and also immune IFN-\u03b3, and can potentiate the antiviral action of IFN-\u03b1, but not of IFN-\u03b3 [8]. Clearance of viral infections requires cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which are also highly dependent on the presence of Zn [7]. Antibody production during both the first and an immunological memory response is disturbed by Zn deficiency [9,10], indicating that Zn is necessary for optimal results following vaccination.",

Diarrhea is caused by impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function, which most likely leads to malnutrition and decreased uptake of micronutrients, including Zn. It was shown that oral Zn supplementation with high doses was able to counteract this loss, improve intestinal mucosal integrity as well as absorption of water and electrolytes [12,14]. Furthermore, it leads to a faster regeneration of the gut epithelium [15]. However, because of environmental concerns, the maximum level of Zn allowed in pig diets was set up to 150 ppm in the European Union, irrespective of the Zn formulation [16].",

High levels of dietary Zn provided as ZnO have been recently shown to outbalance Zn homeostasis with increased accumulation of Zn in various organs including the small intestine of piglets [18,19]. Since intestinal Zn uptake can also take place through passive diffusion, it is likely that very high dietary Zn levels would indirectly increase the intestinal barrier function as a protection mechanism of the epithelium. In addition, metallothionein that is induced by Zn accumulation in intestinal tissue may also protect the tissue from oxidative damage.",

No further changes in villus morphology in the Znhigh group (n = 6) could be detected (Figure 4A and B). In piglets from the Znlow group, the majority of jejunal enterocytes was caspase-3-positive while being morphologically altered, whereas in Znmed jejunal tissue the number of caspase-3-positive cells were drastically reduced and there was a further reduction of apoptotic cells in Znhigh animals (Figure 5A and B). The epithelial architecture of Znmed and Znhigh jejunum was apparently not impaired. The crypt epithelium was not affected by TGEV infection at any Zn concentration.",

TGEV infection causes villus atrophy with severe and frequently fatal diarrhea in newborn pigs, while the clinical signs in older piglets or in adult pigs are milder or inapparent because of a higher replacement rate of enterocytes compared to newborn piglet [22-24]. However, asymptomatic older piglets may serve as carriers, and the high mutation rates of coronavirus genomes may lead to the generation of more virulent genotypes. For this study we infected weaned piglets with a cell-culture adapted TGEV strain, for which direct antiviral effects of Zn were proven in vitro[5], and tested if direct antiviral and/or systemic effects of different Zn levels could be observed in vivo. Critical factors for the reduction in the mortality and morbidity of piglets from TGE include a reduction in the infectious agent, and oral rehydration therapy for the treatment of dehydration and metabolic acidosis associated with acute diarrhea [12].",

            "text": "In this study, TGEV infection caused only mild clinical symptoms, which can be explained by the piglets\u2019 age and by the use of a tissue-culture adapted virus strain, which was chosen on purpose in order to directly compare results from this study with previous in vitro results [25]. Furthermore, in our study the piglets were provided with a relatively comfortable environment to minimize stress other than that induced by infection. It should be stressed that our experimental conditions vary substantially from those in commercial farming conditions. This could also contribute to the absence of severe clinical signs after infection. However, this study demonstrated that feeding the Znhigh diet improved the fecal score and led to higher body weights after infection in comparison to the Znmed and Znlow groups. Several studies demonstrated that feeding high levels of Zn reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhea and improved fecal consistency [26,27]. Our results are consistent with these findings showing that the Znhigh group had higher fecal scores compared to the Znmed and Znlow groups after infection. There was also a direct correlation between Zn levels and histological changes. TGEV infection in the Znlow group led to destruction of the enterocytes of jejunal villi as reflected by marked villus atrophy. It has been reported that Zn plays a fundamental role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and function. For example, supplementation of Zn reduced methotrexate-induced intestinal damage and resulted in faster recovery [28], while it reduced intestinal permeability in Bangladeshi children with acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea syndrome [29]. Furthermore, feeding supplemental Zn to rats with experimental colitis improved mucosal repair by regulating tight junction permeability [30]. In agreement with these data, higher Repi, corr values in the Znmed and Znhigh group indicate that Zn may prevent epithelial barrier loss induced by TGEV. The dramatic increase in \u2206ISCFSK, corr observed in the Znlow group despite the reduced surface area may be interpreted as a protective mechanism. Chloride secretion is the basis of secretory diarrhea and might be regarded as a mechanism to rapidly extrude pathogens. The increase in \u2206ISCGlc, corr observed in some of the animals from the Znlow group may be a compensatory effect and is in agreement with the observation that, even in the Znlow group, animals gained weight at a normal rate. This considerably larger variance in the Znlow group indicates that some animals were able to compensate reduced glucose uptake due to the loss of villi by increasing glucose transport capacity.",

In agreement with such finding, TGEV-specific serum antibody titers were detected earlier and at higher levels in Znhigh when compared to Znlow piglets. This finding may be the result of multiple effects of Zn on antigen-presenting cells, T-cells and antibody-producing B-lymphocytes. IgA is the primary immunoglobulin isotype induced at the mucosal surface. Secretory IgA (sIgA) in mucosal secretions provides protection against bacterial and viral pathogens and neutralizes microbial toxins [32]. Zn can influence sIgA levels by altering the cytokine profile of stimulated immune cells residing in the gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) [33]. Furthermore, sIgA responses are mediated through activated Th2 cells producing, among other, abundant amount of IL-6 [34]. In this study, there was an increased sIgA levels from 1 to 18 dpi, indicating that adaptive mucosal immune responses were induced by TGEV infection but not influenced by the diet. This finding is in accordance with results from Broom and colleagues [33], who also showed only slight differences of intestinal IgA concentrations between animals either receiving low or high levels of dietary ZnO. In accordance with these findings, the expression of IL-6 in the intestinal tissues also showed no difference between the dietary groups at 1 dpi. Therefore, it is questionable if Zn plays a role in enhancing intestinal IgA concentration.",

As reported previously, this indicates an outbalanced Zn homeostasis although the expression of Zn transporters in the jejunum was regulated to reduce Zn uptake (ZIP4) from the gut lumen and increase the export of Zn from epithelial cells (ZnT1, ZnT5) in the Znhigh group. However, an increased level of Zn in intestinal tissue and the induction of metallothionein may explain our observations of improved intestinal mucosal integrity and histological changes, which are in line with other studies [12,14].

            "text": "The paracellular epithelial barrier is highly regulated both under normal conditions and in disease. During infection, TNF-\u03b1 is a mediator between the immune system and the intestinal epithelial barrier by altering tight junction proteins and their cellular localization. More specifically, the cytokine up-regulates the pore-forming protein claudin-2 [40] and redistributes the tightening protein claudin-1 [41]. This leads to an impaired barrier function which is associated with increased paracellular permeability. However, our in vitro work [25] and the in vivo study presented here did not find any up- or down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 after TGEV infection in any of the experimental groups. The outcome is, however, in accordance with the data set of permeability to fluorescein (PFLUcorr), as paracellular permeability was not affected. The data could, therefore, be interpreted as a result of a different pathological mechanism, possibly mediated by IFN-\u03b1, rather than by TNF-\u03b1, as up-regulation of the former in Znlow piglets was clearly evident.",

Diets either contained no additional ZnO (Znlow: 50 mg Zn/kg diet), or were supplemented with analytical grade ZnO (>98% purity) to contain 150 mg Zn/kg diet (Znmed) or 2,500 mg Zn/kg diet (Znhigh). The Znlow diet represents the regular feed of the animals and the Znlow group, therefore, represented the control group for this experiment. At 26 days of age, animals were moved to a containment facility (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Risikobewertung, Berlin, Germany) where they were randomly allocated to 6 pens per group. The piglets were fed the respective diet ad libitum in a pelleted form, water was also provided ad libitum by nipple drinkers. The pens were of equal size (2.8 m2), equipped with a feeding automate with 5 feeding places and a nipple drinker. The floors were covered with rubber mate and a red light lamp was placed above to provide additional heat. Room temperature was kept at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with humidity of 50 - 60% and constant air volume exchange. The pens were thoroughly cleaned by brushing the floors and walls with consecutive flushing with lukewarm water in the mornings. Superficial flushing of the floors was additionally performed in the late afternoon. At day 28 of age, all piglets were challenged orally with 2 mL TGEV with a titer of 1.0E+07 PFU/mL. In each group, half of the piglets (n = 10 per group) were sacrificed 1 day post infection (dpi) in order to examine acute infection, since piglets reportedly display strong symptoms of gastroenteritis within 20 h post-infection [42], and the other half (n = 10 per group) were sacrificed 18 dpi to see the effect of Zn on adaptive immune response.",
