Within the nucleus, nucleoli are key compartments that contribute to a growing number of cellular processes [1-10]. As such, nucleoli carry out ribosome biogenesis and sequester or associate with key molecules that regulate cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, apoptosis and the stress response [1-12]. All of these processes are directly relevant to human health and make the nucleolus a potential target for therapeutic intervention [11-14].",

As dynamic compartments, nucleoli are characterized by a constant flux of macromolecules, in part due to their shuttling between nucleoli and the surrounding nucleoplasm. Advanced fluorescence microscopy and photobleaching techniques revealed the highly dynamic nature of the nucleolus which is characterized by the transient association of many nucleolar proteins with this compartment [15,16]. This feature is further emphasized by the short residence time of some of the nucleolar components; for example, fibrillarin may spend less than 40 seconds in the nucleolus of BHK cells [17]. Such a dynamic organization enables the nucleolus to rapidly respond to alterations in cell physiology, coordinate the responses to these changes and communicate them to the rest of the cell [1,2,4-6]. To understand the functional organization of nucleoli, accurate, reliable and fast techniques are required which can reveal subtle differences in the molecular makeup and activities of this compartment.",

            "text": "Recent advances in proteomics indicate that up to several thousand different proteins could be associated with nucleoli [18-22]. However, despite the universal use of proteomic analysis and its success in identifying nucleolar proteins, it is still challenging to study the highly dynamic nucleolar proteome or the processes located in this compartment. As such, the detection of proteins that transiently associate with nucleoli is technically difficult for several reasons [21]. For instance, disruption of the cell integrity, which is necessary to isolate subcellular organelles or compartments, may lead to partial or complete disassembly of the fragile, membrane-less nucleoli. Ultimately, this may cause the loss of some nucleolar components, in particular those that are mobile and shuttle in and out of the nucleolus. On the other hand, the isolation of nucleoli from lysed nuclei by density gradient centrifugation may be complicated by cross-contamination with components that share a similar density or associate with nucleoli due to the lack of a nucleolar membrane [21]. These difficulties instigate the demand for additional techniques that can be combined with proteomic studies and generate new insights into the structural and functional organization of nucleoli. The procedures described by us provide powerful tools that serve this purpose. In particular, we present quantitative methods that rely on computer-based image analysis to measure fluorescence intensities in nucleoli. These assays employ several functions of the analysis software to first identify nucleoli and then quantify fluorescence signals that are located in this compartment. The protocols developed by us can be easily combined with automated high throughput screening (HTS) platforms, making it possible to obtain large data sets and analyze many of the biological processes that are linked to nucleoli.",

            "text": "Measurements of organellar or compartment-specific concentrations of molecules frequently depend on a marker that identifies the subcellular structure of interest. It further requires that the marker detects a specific organelle or compartment under a variety of experimental conditions. However, in the case of nucleoli this approach is challenging, since several of the nucleolar \"marker\" proteins relocate in response to environmental or disease-induced changes. This is demonstrated in Figure 1 for two prominent nucleolar proteins, B23 (also known as nucleophosmin, NPM) and fibrillarin. Both proteins redistribute in response to stress, and their concentration in nucleoli can vary between different cells. Thus, B23 and fibrillarin cannot always serve as a reliable marker to define the nucleolar compartment. To overcome this obstacle, we present several distinct methods that measure pixel intensities in nucleoli (summarized in Figure 2). These procedures depend on recent advancements in computer-based image analysis and do not require a specific nucleolar marker protein. The different protocols developed by us accommodate a wide variety of experimental settings. They have been applied successfully to measure nucleolar pixel intensities for GFP-tagged reporter proteins, immunostained endogenous proteins and de novo synthesized RNA. These protocols measure the nucleolar fluorescence in multiple steps that involve three main operations (Figure 2): (1) Detection and demarcation of nucleoli. (2) Reduction of noise and false positives. (3) Segmentation and quantification of fluorescent signals. To perform each of these operations, different functions of the analysis software can be employed. The choice of the appropriate function is dependent on the image to be analyzed (see Methods).",

We combined several functions of this software in an ordered fashion to delimit the nucleolar compartment.

Using this information, dark \"holes\" are identified within the nucleoplasm by applying the morphology filter Detect dark holes.

In additional measurements, carried out with more than 20 cells under nonstress conditions, we used DAPI combined with Pol II staining to quantify the pixel intensities for the nucleolar protein RPA194 (a subunit of RNA polymerase I). We chose RPA194 for the quantification, because it is not uniformly distributed in nucleoli and therefore particularly challenging to locate and quantify. For this experiment, the pixel intensities/area obtained for RPA194 with the Detect light holes filter operation was defined as 100%. Using DAPI and the Detect dark holes filter, 67% of the pixel intensities were measured, whereas the quantification based on Pol II and the Detect dark holes filter measured 74% of the fluorescence signal. The combination of the DAPI and Pol II images improved the detection of the RNA polymerase I subunit RPA194 to 80%. Taken together, Method 3 provides an improvement in the signal detection; however, one of the drawbacks of Method 3 is that it reduces the number of additional fluorochromes that can be employed in the same experiment.",

Thus, we examined whether heat stress altered the nucleolar/nuclear ratio of B23 or fibrillarin (Figure 5e). With these analyses, no drastic change in the nucleolar/nuclear ratio was detected for B23, whereas the ratio decreased significantly for fibrillarin. Since heat stress reduced the amount of B23 in nucleoli, but not the nucleolar/nuclear ratio, this may suggest that B23 relocated to the cytoplasm or was degraded upon heat shock. We tested this idea by quantifying the nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence in control and heat-stressed cells following published procedures [23]. This quantification showed a reduction of pixel intensities in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment. However, there was no significant change in the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescence, which was 1 \u00b1 0.05 (SEM, n = 26) for control and 1.13 \u00b1 0.06 (SEM, n = 26) for heat-shocked cells.

Additional file 3 shows the double staining of Pol II and RPA194 in heat-treated cells. The staining pattern obtained for Pol II was useful to define the nucleolar compartment under these conditions, and we were able to demarcate nucleoli based on Pol II alone or by the combination of DAPI and Pol II staining. Notably, although RPA194 is less affected by heat stress than other nucleolar proteins, RPA194 relocates within the nucleus in response to other treatments. Therefore, RPA194 is not suitable as a universal marker for nucleoli. By contrast, the non-nucleolar protein Pol II is useful to demarcate nucleoli under these conditions.",

In addition to the results shown in Figure 3, we monitored under different physiological conditions the distribution of GFP-hsc70, a valid model to analyze the chaperone hsc70 in growing cells [26]. Using the quantification protocols developed by us, Figure 7 demonstrates that in transiently transfected cells the nucleolar accumulation of GFP-hsc70 significantly changes during the recovery from heat stress. Since the data in Figure 7 were obtained with cells that were only transiently transfected, we did not test the suitability of this assay for high throughput screening (see below).

One step towards this goal is the development of protocols to quantify individual components of the nucleolus in a fashion that is fast, accurate and applicable to a large number of experimental settings. Although fluorescence microscopy can be used to visualize molecules in nucleoli, this method remains rather qualitative and subtle changes in the concentration of nucleolar components can be easily missed. As an alternative method to examine the nucleolar proteome, quantitative mass spectrometry has addressed different aspects of nucleolar organization [15,30,31]. One disadvantage of this technique is the necessity to purify nucleoli, possibly leading to the loss of components that are not tightly bound. Thus, for the accurate quantification of molecules located in nucleoli, alternative strategies are needed that circumvent these limitations. To this end, we developed protocols that combine microscopy with computer-based image analysis to measure pixel intensities in nucleoli in a quantitative and reliable fashion. The methods described here keep the structural integrity of cells and nucleoli intact, they are easy to use and applicable to nucleolar molecules that are present in very low abundance or only loosely associated with this compartment. We demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques by monitoring the dynamic association of proteins B23 and fibrillarin with nucleoli under different physiological conditions. Furthermore, we showed the usefulness of our protocols to detect proteins in nucleoli that are fused to a fluorescent reporter, and to quantify newly synthesized RNA that is associated with nucleoli. Among the protocols discussed here Method 1 is the simplest, and we applied it successfully to several different cell lines. Additional methods described by us are valuable to measure nucleolar fluorescence under more specialized conditions.",

Although the Erode filter will miss some of the nucleoli, it has the advantage that the number of false positives is low. Since the Erode filter demarcates an area that is smaller than the authentic nucleolus, the Dilate filter is applied on the Erode image (see Additional file 6 for details). This operation ensures that the regions identified by the software colocalize with the actual nucleolus. The Dilate filter uses the same principle as the Erode filter, however, it assigns to black pixels the value 1 (white), depending on the number of white pixels in the neighborhood.
