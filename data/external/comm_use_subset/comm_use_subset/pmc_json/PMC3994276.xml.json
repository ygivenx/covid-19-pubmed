            "text": "The presence of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is known to trigger innate immune reactions, especially the stimulation of genes downstream type I interferon (IFN)\n[1]. Among the variety of IFN-stimulated gene products, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a key executor of this antiviral response\n[2]. As a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) for viral dsRNA, PKR is considered to be significant for type I IFN production\n[3]. The ubiquitously expressed PKR is usually present in an inactive form at a low abundance, but is activated by conformational change and autophosphorylation upon binding of dsRNA, generated during viral genome replication\n[4]. PKR activation leads to the phosphorylation of its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) on serine residue 51, which increases the affinity of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 for eIF2\u03b2, which is required for protein translation, leading to the cessation of translation and consequent inhibition of viral replication\n[5,6]. PKR has been demonstrated to serve as a PRR in the mediation of IFN production in West Nile virus (WNV) infection\n[7]. Consistent with WNV infection, PKR is also required for IFN production in response to other RNA viruses, including encephalomyocarditis virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)\n[8]. However, HCV infection arrested PKR-activated cap-dependent protein synthesis, thereby suppressing the translation of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) preventing the IFN-\u03b2 induction\n[9].",

Six transcriptional units encode two surface glycoproteins, the fusion protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase, the matrix protein, and the ribonucleoprotein complex, composed of the nucleocapsid protein (NP), a phosphoprotein, and large polymerase, which is necessary for viral transcription and replication. As is often the case, for its genomic replication, NDV first generates a full-length positive-strand antigenomic RNA and then, in turn, serves as a template for the synthesis of new negative-stranded RNA genome, which forms a dsRNA intermediate\n[12].",

NDV infection can also induce PKR autophosphorylation and subsequently limit protein synthesis\n[14]. Previous reports also showed that PKR is not required for induction of IFN\u03b1 upon NDV infection\n[15]. However, there is little information available in the literature regarding PKR inhibitory mechanisms in the context of NDV infection. In the current report, we found that the NDV lentogenic strain LaSota and velogenic strain Herts/33 both triggered PKR activation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated the antiviral effects of PKR and explored the role of eIF2\u03b1 in response to NDV replication. Our results indicated that the PKR-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is responsible for the antiviral effect against NDV. Notably, NDV-induced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were decreased in PKR knockdown HeLa cells using specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) for PKR, indicating that PKR was necessary for NDV-induced IFN synthesis.",

Furthermore, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, the substrate of phosphorylated PKR, was observed at 12 and 24 hpi. To further verify this finding, we explored the NDV-induced phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2\u03b1 at a dose of 0.5, 1, or 2 MOI for 12 h. Notably, western blot analysis results showed that PKR and eIF2\u03b1 could be phosphorylated by NDV strains LaSota (Figure \n1C) and Herts/33 (Figure \n1D) in a dose-dependent manner.",

Recently, PKR-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation followed by translation inhibition has been shown to play a role in inhibition of viral replication\n[17]. To investigate whether eIF2\u03b1 was involved in NDV replication, we established eIF2\u03b1 knockdown cells by transfecting siRNA specific to eIF2\u03b1 or non-targeting siRNA into HeLa cells, followed by infection with NDV strain Herts/33. The efficiency of siRNA and the content of eIF2\u03b1 and NP proteins were analyzed by western blot analysis. Transfection of sieIF2\u03b1 resulted in a reduction of eIF2\u03b1 protein level by 4.5 folds in mock-infected cells (Figure \n4A, B). As shown in Figure \n4A, viral NP protein was decreased by approximately 80% in eIF2\u03b1 knockdown cells compared to that of control cells. Consistent with this finding, eIF2\u03b1 knockdown resulted in a 2.6-fold increase in extracellular virus yield, indicating that eIF2\u03b1 knockdown significantly impaired NDV replication (Figure \n4C). Okadaic acid (OA) was defined as a protein phosphatase inhibitor, promoting eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation\n[18]. To further confirm the function of eIF2\u03b1 in NDV replication, we augmented eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in HeLa cells through OA treatment. PKR and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation were significantly increased in OA-treatment cell, compared with that in mock cells (Figure \n4D-E). To intuitively confirm whether eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation plays a role in NDV infection, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing NDV ZJ1 strain (ZJ1-GFP) was utilized\n[19]. As shown in Figure \n4G, in contrast to untreated cells, in the presence of OA, the percentage of GFP-positive cells was significantly decreased. Analysis of the spotlights under the fluorescence microscope showed that interfering with eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation pharmacologically led to an approximate 3-fold decrease in intracellular ZJ1-GFP replication. Above all, these results indicated that eIF2\u03b1 is required for NDV replication and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by active PKR induces an antiviral effect in NDV-infected cells.",

Many viruses have evolved various inhibitory mechanisms targeting PKR\n[25-27]. Viral proteins counteract the PKR pathway at different levels by sequestering dsRNA, inhibiting PKR activation, synthesizing PKR pseudosubstrates, inhibiting PKR dimerization, degrading PKR, or activating antagonist phosphatases\n[2]. The correlation between PKR and NDV has been suggested by the fact that NDV infection induces PKR phosphorylation and subsequently inhibits host gene translation\n[14]. A later study showed that the expression of the NDV nonstructural protein V decreased PKR activation\n[28]. Although these studies primarily indicated the interaction between PKR and NDV infection, detailed evidence for its antiviral mechanism remains limited.",

The fact that both the lentogenic strain La Sota and velogenic strain Herts/33 could induce the PKR/eIF2\u03b1 signaling cascade indicated that this response is likely to be a general anti-NDV mechanism. It seems that Herts/33 is able to increase the fraction of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 compared to LaSota. One hypothesis assumed that no trypsin was added in the supernatant of LaSota-infected cells. Therefore LaSota was not able to re-infect after one round of virus replication. The other proposed that the differences of nonstructural protein, such as V, between velogenic Herts/33 and lentogenic LaSota strains contribute to the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. PKR and eIF2\u03b1 were not phosphorylated in the cells treated with UV-inactivated viruses, indicating that NDV replication is required for PKR activation (Figure \n1E). PKR is activated by intracellular dsRNA generated by various viruses, such as WNV\n[8]. On the other hand, Sendai virus C protein restricted PKR activation by limiting dsRNA generation\n[14]. To verify whether dsRNA is involved in PKR activation during NDV infection, mAb J2 recognizing the dsRNA molecules was used to confirm the generation of dsRNA in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells infected with either lentogenic or velogenic NDV strains, but not UV-inactivated NDV, which was consistent with the activation of PKR after NDV infection. Since UV treatment impairs the ability of NDV to replicate, leading to the inhibition of viral dsRNA generation, subsequent PKR-eIF2\u03b1 signaling was blocked (Figure \n2).",

            "text": "In the present study, dsRNAs were presented as punctuate dots accumulated in NDV-infected HeLa cells, suggesting that dsRNAs might interact with cellular PRRs that recognize dsRNA to form dsRNA-PRR complexes and then mediate downstream signaling, such as the IFN pathway or nuclear translocation of nuclear factor \u03baB\n[32,33]. As a critical PRR recognizing virus dsRNA, PKR primarily acts as a viral antagonist through activation of the type I IFN signaling pathway. Since the role of PKR in type I IFN production during viral replication varies, we next evaluated the effect of PKR on IFN-\u03b2 production after NDV infection. Our results showed that IFN-\u03b2 production coincided with PKR/eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation during NDV infection. Moreover, PKR knockdown reduced IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels after NDV infection (Figure \n5), which was contrary to the findings in previous reports that PKR deficiency did not prevent IFN-\u03b2 responses to NDV infection in mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n[34]. In addition, as mentioned, previous report has shown that PKR is not required for induction of IFN\u03b1 upon NDV infection\n[15]. Subsequently, the PKR requirement for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production might be virus- and strain-specific\n[8]. Also, there is a reasonable possibility that these observations might be related to the different cell models used in various experiments. In addition to PKR, other PRRs, such as toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), RIG-I, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), could also be recognized by dsRNA. Therefore, we could not rule out the possibility that other PRRs evoke IFN-\u03b2 production through recognition of dsRNA generated by NDV infection\n[35-37]. To elucidate the mechanism of cross-talk between PKR, TLR3, and RIG/MDA5 during NDV infection, further studies are needed.",

Inhibition of the PKR/eIF2\u03b1 signaling cascade significantly impaired NDV infection, indicating the critical role of PKR in restricting NDV infection. The fact that PKR knockdown suppressed IFN-\u03b2 production in NDV infection indicated that PKR plays an anti-NDV role via IFN-\u03b2 upregulation.
