In the 2015/2016 season, several European countries reported a high number of severe cases and outcomes in the groups at risk and healthy young adults; these events were associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 clade 6B.1 infection5,6. Since 1999, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has established a nationwide surveillance system requiring contract virologic laboratories to perform continuous virologic surveillance for respiratory viruses, particularly influenza and enteroviruses; this system was established after an epidemic of enterovirus 71 in 19987. The long-term National Influenza Surveillance Network described the epidemiologic pattern of circulating viruses, and it has successfully identified the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus and adenovirus8,9. Moreover, it also identified the novel H7N9 and H6N1 influenza viruses10. Following the large magnitude of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity from July 2009 to January 2010, a second A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic, evidenced by a sharp increase in the number of hospitalized patients and fatal cases, occurred in the winter of 201011. Subsequently, A(H1N1)pdm09 has persisted at varying levels in the 2015/2016 season, when another A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic occurred. The 2015/2016 outbreak included a sudden increase in the number of clinical cases with severe complications in adults aged 50\u201364 years.",

Independently, we conducted a retrospective cohort study at Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital to analyze the clinical characteristics and complications of patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in the five A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant seasons (2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015) as identified by the National Influenza Surveillance Network.

The percentages of patients included in each department were significantly different between each season (Table 1). A phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) sequences recovered in these epidemics, along with geographically diverse global influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 viral sequences, has revealed that the sequences are members of clades 1, 2, and 8 in 2009/2010; clades 3, 4, 5, and 7 in 2010/2011; clades 7 and 6C in 2012/2013; clade 6B in 2013/2014; and clades 6B, 6B.1, and 6B.2 in 2015/2016 (Fig. S1A).

The effect of 6B/6B.1/6B.2 season on the total number of influenza-related complications was not significant in children aged \u22645 years. However, it was significantly stronger among individuals aged \u22656 years (Table S1).",

Early antiviral treatment that reduces influenza-related complications, including lower respiratory tract infection, was evaluated14. In the present study, the association between antiviral treatment and the occurrence of complications should be attributed to the antiviral treatment frequently used in patients with influenza-related complications. Furthermore, we observed that the severity of influenza differed significantly, especially in individuals aged \u22656 years, during the 6B/6B.1/6B.2-predominant and 6B/6B.1/6B.2-non-predominant seasons.",

            "text": "After the 2009 pandemic, when the 2009 H1N1 virus became a regularly circulating seasonal influenza strain, the WHO recommended the use of the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus as a vaccine strain. In the face of a cumulatively established population immunity, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus would need to exhibit antigenic changes to avoid suppression by the host immune system. To date, eight genetic virus groups have been identified15. In 2013/2014, clade 6B appeared, achieving general dominance over other influenza viruses4. During the 2013/2014 season, an unusually high hospitalization rate in adults aged 50\u201364 years was observed in the United States and Mexico3,16. The increased morbidity in middle-aged adults during the 2013/2014 season had been attributed to the low vaccination rate in this age group16. However, that hypothesis cannot explain the unusual number of severe cases because the vaccination rate had already been low during the previous years16,17. An interesting study has shown that up to 42% of middle-aged adults born between 1965 and 1979, who had been exposed to seasonal H1N1 viruses circulating in 1977, had reduced serologic reactivity with the 2013/2014 A(H1N1)pdm09; notably, the 2013/2014 virus harbors the distinctive K163Q HA antigenic mutation18. In the cohort of individuals born between 1965 and 1979, HA-specific antibodies with activity against A(H1N1)pdm09 must have been produced and shaped by exposure to prior-season H1N1 viruses (the so called \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d)19. Nonetheless, the HA-specific antibodies in this cohort failed to recognize the 2013/2014 A(H1N1)pdm09 genetic variant18. This explains the high susceptibility of the members of this middle-aged cohort to the 2013/2014 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruse. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating globally in the 2015/2016 season are members of the phylogenetic clade 6B.1/6B.2, which prevailed in Eastern Europe and Western Asia, resulting in widespread influenza activity and severity20\u201322. In Russia and Israel, 6B.1/6B.2 caused increases in influenza-associated morbidity and mortality5,21. The present study showed that individuals in the 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons compared with non-clade 6B/6B.1/6B.2 seasons were 1.6-, 1.78-, 2.6-, and 5.5-fold at greater risk for any complications, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and the development of ARDS, respectively. Clinically, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is associated with a greater risk of lower respiratory tract infection23,24. The 2013/2014 clade 6B and 2015/2016 A(H1N1)pdm09 clade 6B.1/6B.2 variants are more likely to cause severe pneumonia and acute life-threatening respiratory failure in a range of individuals.",

A potential bias may exist due to the exclusion of all cases with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection for 7 years. Nonetheless, no change was observed in terms of admission or management procedures during these outbreaks. The surveillance and reporting system in Taiwan has long been established. Taken together, the increased frequency of complications in 2013/2014 and 2015/2016 is unlikely due to detection bias. In addition, the major drawback of this study was the lack of documentation about the history of influenza vaccination in the records used to generate this study. However, a study by Taiwan CDC has reported that 95% of patients with complications in the 2015/2016 season had not received the influenza vaccine26. The vaccine coverage rate in non-elderly adults and elderly individuals would have been low during each of the outbreaks, particularly during the first wave, given that no A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was available in 2009/2010. Thus, the increased severity of influenza during the 2013/2014 and 2015/2016 seasons is unlikely to reflect a decreased rate of vaccination. The study has shown that Taiwan experienced the greatest burden of influenza-related complications due to A(H1N1)pdm09 clades 6B/6B.1/6B.2 in the sixth year of its circulation. The reasons for the increased impact of influenza-related complications remain uncertain. Aspects related to the antigenic change of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, immune response of the host, and environmental factors required further investigation. This report shows the importance of influenza disease surveillance and requires that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus should always be considered.",

The Taiwan Influenza Express, a weekly online influenza surveillance report, has been published by the Taiwan CDC from July to May of each year since 2005 (http://www.cdc.gov.tw/english/submenu.aspx?treeid = 00ED75D6C887BB27&nowtreeid = 8F1E239D0FD8877A)10,27. This report includes the total number of respiratory specimens; isolate number of influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B; and case number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in intensive care units (ICUs), a class of events that is considered a category 4 nationally notifiable disease. However, data on weeks 19\u201337 are not available annually. A confirmed case involved a patient who had acute influenza-like illness (temperature \u2265 38 \u00b0C with either cough or sore throat) and nasopharyngeal/throat or bronchoalveolar lavage samples harboring influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as detected using real-time (RT) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or via viral culture11,28. For the purposes of the present study, each season was defined as extending from July of the same year to May of the following year. The annual population figures provided by the Department of Household Registration Affairs of the Interior Ministry were used for the calculation of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases in the ICU.",

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective observational cohort study for the 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2015/2016 seasons. This study was performed at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH), a 4000-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital that is located in northern Taiwan and provides both primary and tertiary care. In addition, CGMH is one of the 8 regional commissioned laboratories of the Taiwan CDC. Patients who had acute influenza-like illness (temperature \u2265 38 \u00b0C with either cough or sore throat) and had influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as detected using RT-PCR assay or via viral culture using respiratory specimens were included in the study. Patients whose data are not available were excluded. The institutional review board of CGMHT approved the study, and it was carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was waived due to the study\u2019s retrospective nature. All medical records of the enrolled patients were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, clinical course, antiviral treatment (oseltamivir or zanamivir), mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU, and death were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI), a measure of obesity, was calculated for patients whose height and weight data were available. Obesity was defined as follows: 1) body weight \u2265 95th percentile in children < 2 years of age; 2) BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2 in patients aged between 2 and 18 years; and 3) BMI > 28 kg/m2 (Chinese criteria) in patients > 18 years29. Medical conditions associated with a high risk for influenza complications were defined based on those listed by the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices30. Patients with confirmed pneumonia on radiography, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute onset of cardiovascular, neurologic condition, respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation; those who were admitted in the ICU; and those who died were considered to have influenza-related complications. Pneumonia on radiography was diagnosed based on the presence of a consolidation, infiltrate, or opacity31. ARDS was defined according to the standard criteria32. The primary study outcome was the occurrence of (any) influenza-related complications. The secondary study outcomes were pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality.",

The RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qigen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RT-PCR and primer pairs used for sequencing HA and NA genes were performed, as previously described33. Sanger sequencing of the viral HA and NA genes was performed to establish clade designation and to detect differences in amino acid33. The obtained amplicons were assembled into a full-length 1,701-bp span for HA and 1410-bp for NA using DNASTAR Lasergene (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Newly reported sequences in this study were deposited at the GenBank database under the accession numbers shown in Fig. S1 for HA and NA genes. The evolution history was inferred by the maximum likelihood method based on the Hasegawa\u2013Kishino\u2013Yano model34. The percentages of replicate trees (1,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test. Phylogenetic analysis in this study was conducted using MEGA735.",
