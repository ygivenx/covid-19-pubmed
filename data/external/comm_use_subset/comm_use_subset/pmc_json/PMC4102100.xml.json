Transmission of highly infectious diseases from infected patient to other patients and HCWs occurs constantly in hospitals and healthcare centres and has been well documented [1\u20133]. Although HCWs are aware of infection control measures, low levels of compliance with standard precautions by this group are frequent [4, 5]. HCWs are less willing to adhere to infection-control practices when they work for extended hours [6], with probable reasons for low compliance being insufficient time, scarcity of equipment, lack of knowledge and low perception of risk [5].",

For any pathogen, more than one transmission route may occur, but many pathogens are known to be transmitted by one predominant mode. In droplet transmission, pathogens or droplets which are larger than 5 \u03bcm, such as influenza virus and Bordetella pertussis are transmitted from an infected patient to HCWs through breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing, as well as through performing high-risk procedures (HRPs) [2, 7, 8]. However, influenza virus has also been documented to be transmitted by the airborne route, which results in infectious particles being present in the air for longer periods of time [9\u201312].",

            "text": "Respiratory infectious diseases, even those with limited airborne transmission, are more likely to be transmitted from patients to HCWs during HRPs such as suctioning and intubation which generate respiratory aerosols [13]. Many studies suggest that both invasive and non-invasive procedures are likely to increase the probability of HCWs being infected [13, 14]. Some studies have reported that non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) can be a risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) transmission to HCWs [15\u201317]. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation, bronchoscopy and suctioning have also been documented to increase the risk of HCWs being infected with SARS and tuberculosis (TB) [18\u201321], while tracheal intubation has been significantly associated with risk of SARS transmission to HCWs [17]. While it has been well documented that TB and SARS can be transmitted to HCWs during aerosol-generating procedures, there are some data suggesting H1N1 can transmit via such procedures [13]. Seasonal influenza also causes outbreaks in healthcare settings [22]. HCWs are one of the most vulnerable groups likely to be infected with influenza infection in acute-care facilities due to the high exposure rates in such settings [23]. An attack rate of nosocomial influenza could reach 11\u201359% in HCWs in a healthcare environment [24]. As such, HCWs are a priority group for preventive strategies such as influenza vaccination [25, 26].",

Details of laboratory methods have been described in a previous publication [27]. We also tested for bacterial colonization. A multiplex PCR (Seegen Inc.) was used to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, B. pertussis, Legionella spp, Chlamydophilia and Haemophilus influenza type B. After preheating at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, 40 amplification cycles were performed under the following conditions in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR system 9700, Applied Biosystems, USA): 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 1\u00b75 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1\u00b75 min. Amplification was completed at the final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The multiplex PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gel.\n",

This has occupational health and safety implications for HCWs routinely engaged in HRPs. More than 10% of HCWs performed a HRP during a 1-month period, and the majority of those performed more than one HRP. This suggests that interventions to reduce transmission of respiratory infections may be more efficient if targeted to HCWs performing HRPs. There may be certain settings such as emergency wards, intensive-care units and respiratory wards where HRPs are more commonly performed, making these important targets for interventions.",

There are variations in infection control practices from hospital to hospital, even within China. However, the quantification of risk for HCWs who perform HRPs has implications for HCWs everywhere. The fact that this was a control group in a larger trial is a strength, rather than a limitation, in that this group had rigorous follow-up and documentation of incident infection as well as risk factors (including HRPs). This provides more robust data than, for example, an observational study such as a case-control study, because it was prospective and measured infection in a group that went about usual practice. To date, there is much policy debate and direction about HRPs, but no data whatsoever to inform the actual risk associated with HRPs.

We have shown in two large randomized controlled trials that the risk of respiratory infection in HCWs can be reduced with the use of N95 respirators [27, 31]. We also show that in high-risk wards, targeted use in situations of self-identified risk, such as when performing HRPs or barrier nursing a patient, is less effective than continuous use of a respirator in that ward while on shift [31]. This suggests that HCWs are unable to identify all situations of risk when left to decide whether or not they should wear a respirator.",
