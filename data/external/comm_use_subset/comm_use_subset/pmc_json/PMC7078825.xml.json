A laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined a patient with positive real-time RT-PCR to SARS-CoV-2, while a suspected case was defined as a patient with history of travelling to Wuhan City or in contact with COVID-19 cases in the 14 days before onset of symptoms and with clinical manifestation of fever, respiratory illness, pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) scan, and/or reduced white blood cells count, but no RT-PCR results. The study period was set between 16 January and 11 February 2020, because the diagnosis criteria were set on 16 January 2020.

It is important to predict the development of this outbreak as early and as reliably as possible, in order to take action to prevent its spread. Our data showed that the two popularly used Internet search engines, Google and Baidu, and the social media platform, Sina Weibo, were able to predict the disease outbreak 1\u20132 weeks earlier than the traditional surveillance systems. The role of Internet surveillance tools in early prediction of other epidemics has been reported previously, including for influenza [4], dengue fever [5], H1N1 [6], Zika [7], measles [8] and Middle East respiratory syndrome [9]. The availability of early information about infectious diseases through Internet search engines and social media will be helpful for making decisions related to disease control and prevention.",

However, our results showed a much longer lag time for reported new laboratory-confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases compared with digital surveillance data. There are several explanations. Firstly, COVID-19 is a novel disease just recently recognised. The first version of a guideline for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 was announced on 16 January 2020. It took time for the medical professionals to learn about the virus and the disease in order to make correct diagnosis. Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases. Thirdly, the supply of laboratory testing kits may have been insufficient in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, which would have limited the number of patients that can be confirmed. Finally, the Internet searches and social media mentions are not only initiated by the patients and their family members, but also globally by the general public who are concerned about this rapidly spreading disease.

A possible explanation is that the Google is not a major search engine used in China, where Baidu and Sina Weibo are widely used. The peak in the Sina Weibo Index was reached earlier than in Google Trends and Baidu Index. This suggests that Sina Weibo, which also serves as a social medium, disseminated the information faster than traditional websites.",

On 8 January 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of this disease. The disease was first named Novel coronavirus pneumonia by the NHC of China on 8 February and later \u2018coronavirus disease 2019\u2019 (abbreviated \u2018COVID-19\u2019) on 11 February by the WHO. Our search period was defined from January 16 to February 11. Therefore, we think that the two keywords \u2018pneumonia\u2019 and \u2018coronavirus\u2019 were sufficient to include most Internet content related to COVID-19 in this period. We also used other terms such as \u2018\u65b0\u51a0\u2018 (novel coronavirus), \u2018\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e\u2019 (novel coronavirus pneumonia) as keywords but they returned much smaller numbers of queries and posts and we did therefore not include them in the analysis.",

We found the same pattern in the Baidu Index and Sina Weibo Index. An explanation could be that \u2018coronavirus\u2019 is linked to the viral pathogen which should be investigated by a laboratory test, while \u2018pneumonia\u2019 is a clinical term and should link stronger to the suspected cases that are based on clinical and imaging evidence.",
