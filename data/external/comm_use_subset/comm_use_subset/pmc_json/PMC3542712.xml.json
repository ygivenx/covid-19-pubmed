Consequently, research into bat viromes is intensifying and results obtained from those investigations show that viruses in bat populations exhibit significant genetic diversity. Marked diversity of lyssaviruses (Delmas et al., 2008), coronaviruses (Tang et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2006), astroviruses (Chu et al., 2008) and, more recently, adenoviruses (Li et al., 2010) and circoviruses (Ge et al., 2011) has been reported. In some cases, this diversity has led to speculation that chiropterans have ancient relationships with these viral families, and consequently act as reservoirs for emergence (Badrane & Tordo, 2001; Gouilh et al., 2011). Bats are known to harbour multiple paramyxoviruses, including rubulaviruses and henipaviruses that have spilled over into humans and/or domestic animals (Calisher et al., 2006; Chant et al., 1998; Lau et al., 2010).",

Plastic sheeting was laid out underneath the tree approximately 1 h before dawn (adapted from Chua, 2003). On return from foraging, bats urinated and defecated on the sheets and 1 ml pools of neat urine were collected by pipette and divided equally between two vials for PCR analysis and virus isolation. Care was taken to avoid contact with faeces but it is possible that small amounts of faecal contamination were present in the samples. Samples were stored and transported at ~4 \u00b0C before freezing and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further processing. RNA was extracted from 500 \u00b5l neat urine from each pool using the MagMAX viral RNA isolation kit and a MagMAX Express-96 automated extraction unit (Life Technologies \u2013 Applied Biosystems), using a 1 : 2 ratio of sample to lysis buffer.",

Both the PMV-PCR and RMH-PCR assays were highly effective at detecting novel paramyxovirus sequences and consequently will likely continue to be used in other field studies. However, they were not equivocal in their results and these analyses provide important insights into their differential capabilities that are likely applicable across other species and sites. The assays differed in their specificities, with the PMV-PCR detecting sequences throughout the Paramyxovirinae phylogeny (with the notable exception of sequences closely related to avulaviruses) and the RMH-PCR being restricted to respiro-, morbilli- and henipa- viruses. This is likely caused by the greater redundancy of the PMV-PCR primers and is further evidenced by the results from 10 samples in which sequence was detected using PMV-PCR but not using RMH-PCR. The sequences derived from these 10 samples showed phylogenetic clustering (Fig. 1), with the majority within the genus Rubulavirus. The broader specificity of the PMV-PCR is also what likely allowed this assay to detect intrasample diversity more frequently than was observed with the RMH-PCR. It should be noted, however, that sequences derived from the same sample could be derived from different viruses and/or bats due to the nature of the sampling method.",

Thus, it is likely that the uniquely detected samples in the case of the RMH-PCR are the result of increased assay sensitivity as reported in the original in vitro studies (Tong et al., 2008). Due to differences in phylogenetic tree topology produced by different polymerase regions, and the differing sensitivity and specificity of the assays, it is difficult to comment on the relationships of sample sequences generated by different PCRs. However, sample U6 notably generated unique and poorly placed clusters in phylogenetic analysis of both regions.",

This demonstrates that neat urine pools are a robust sample type for investigation into paramyxoviruses in bat populations. Indeed, novel paramyxoviruses have since been isolated and characterized from this population (K. S. Baker and others, unpublished data). Not only is collecting urine from underneath roosts highly efficacious for qualitative virus population studies, but the non-invasive nature of the collection method would facilitate the study of infection dynamics free from sampling-induced stress. However, one disadvantage is that the viral sequences detected here cannot be absolutely confirmed as having been derived from E. helvum. Although co-roosting with other species has not previously been observed, and sheeting was supervised throughout the sampling period, detection of these sequences in samples directly collected from individual bats would be required to confirm their origin.",

Furthermore, their close relationships with previously detected paramyxovirus sequences in Ghanaian E. helvum (Drexler et al., 2009) and sequences detected in urine collected from E. helvum roosts in Uganda and Tanzania (A. J. Peel and others, unpublished results) supports these findings and increases our understanding of the diversity of paramyxoviruses in Africa. Indeed, the sequences described here support the further expansion of the genus Rubulavirus, which appears to have commenced with the detection of other bat-derived paramyxoviruses namely menangle, tioman and tuhoko viruses. Also, our data give rise to numerous phylogenetically distinct, but poorly placed clusters of viral sequences, perhaps indicating that viruses belonging to novel genera may be circulating in the study population. Such diversity and expansion of the paramyxovirus phylogeny within a single population implies that adaptive mutations required for emergence may be present in the reservoir host, and also may suggest that a co-evolutionary relationship between Chiroptera and Paramyxoviridae exists, as has been proposed for other viral families (Badrane & Tordo, 2001; Gouilh et al., 2011). The presence of intrasample diversity is intriguing and may reflect co-infection of an individual, or alternatively may have resulted from the pooling of co-circulating viruses from different bats. Further studies, such as examination of urine samples from individual bats would be required to differentiate between these possibilities.",
