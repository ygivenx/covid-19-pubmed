            "text": "Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, which are characterized by segmented negative sense RNA genomes. The viral RNAs (vRNAs) are bound by nucleoprotein (NP) and three viral polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, and PA) to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, the minimal replication unit [1\u20133]. Influenza vRNAs have conserved 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminals that contain all the signals necessary for transcription, replication, and packaging [4, 5]. vRNAs with precise 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends are generally obtained using the RNA polymerase I (PolI) promoter [6, 7]. Viral polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein are synthesized under the regulation of the RNA polymerase II (PolII) promoter [8]. To generate influenza virus, pure plasmid-based reverse genetics systems are developed using 12\u201317 plasmids [9, 10]. Invention of the PolI-PolII bidirectional transcription vector results in a more robust 8-plasmid system [11, 12]. Due to the fact that PolI promoters are species-specific [13], different reverse genetics systems are developed for primate, avian, and canine cells [9, 14\u201316]. A universal T7 promoter-based system has been built, but shows less efficiency than the PolI-based bidirectional transcription system [17]. Through tandem ligation of multiple viral gene cassettes, influenza virus is reconstituted using a 3-plasmid system [18], and a single DNA construct [19, 20].",

            "text": "An important application of reverse genetics is the generation of influenza vaccine seed viruses [21\u201323]. Usually, seasonal influenza vaccine is composed of two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus. Using the reverse genetics method, each seed virus is generated with HA and NA from a circulating strain, and the remaining six segments from a high-yield strain or an attenuated strain [24\u201326]. Nonetheless, manufacture of the vaccines still heavily relies on embryonated hens\u2019 eggs or cell culture to grow the viruses [27], two time-consuming processes which are unlikely to provide adequate vaccines for a sudden influenza pandemic. The majority of vaccines are administered through intramuscular injection or by individually nasal spray, two labor-intensive ways which further increase the cost of current vaccines in vaccinating huge flocks of birds. To develop a quick-manufacturable and low-cost influenza vaccine, we proposed that an influenza viral genome-encoding plasmid could be delivered in vivo by a bacterial carrier, resulting in production of attenuated influenza viruses to induce protective immunity against influenza [19]. In a feasibility study, we constructed a chicken PolI-driven plasmid expressing all vRNAs, NP and polymerase from a influenza A virus (A/WSN/33) [19]. Generation of influenza virus was found in cultured avian cells infected by auxotrophic Salmonella strains carrying the plasmid or its derivatives, but not in chickens inoculated with the recombinant Salmonella [28]. The study proved that a single plasmid could be constructed to reconstitute influenza virus and stably maintained in engineered Salmonella strains. The engineered Salmonella could deliver the plasmid into host cells resulting in generation of live influenza virus. Nonetheless, to make the hypothesized influenza vaccine, the one-plasmid reverse genetics system still needs to be improved in virus generation efficiency, and the Salmonella carrier has to be engineered to deliver plasmid efficiently, especially in vivo.",

Some rodent cell lines, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, are widely used for research and vaccine development [29\u201331]. BHK-21 cells synthesize \u03b1-2, 3 and \u03b1-2, 6 sialic acid (SA) linked receptors [32], and support the growth of influenza A and B viruses [32, 33].

EGFP expression was observed in BHK-21 cells only when pYA4924 has been cotransfected with plasmids encoding influenza polymerase and NP (Data not shown), suggesting that the cloned MPI is functional in hamster cells. By combining MPI with the SV40 polyadenylation sequence (SV40 pA, 131 bp), truncated mouse PolI terminator (MTI, 41 bp), and functional truncated CMV promoter (188 bp), a bidirectional CMV/MPI-driven transcription vector, pYA4963, was constructed. Two BsmBI sites were designed between MPI and MTI to allow precise insertion of influenza cDNA. A BamHI site was designed between the two BsmBI sites. By inserting a prokaryotic GFP-expression cassette at the BamHI site, an easy-to-use bidirectional vector pYA4964 was constructed (Fig. 1). Substitution of the GFP cassette with influenza cDNA resulted in loss of green fluorescence in bacterial host cells.

Unique restriction enzyme cleavage sites were designed at each end of the cassette to allow insertion of the other cassette. A prokaryotic GFP cassette was first inserted between two adjacent enzyme sites, followed by selection of green colonies under excitation with 488 nm light. The GFP cassettes were then substituted with influenza cassettes by selecting non-fluorescent colonies. These steps resulted in four 2-unit plasmids, with each unit representing a bidirectional influenza cassette. The GFP cassettes were again inserted into three of the 2-unit plasmids. Each of the two 2-unit plasmids were combined to obtain two 4-unit plasmids, pYA4988 and pYA4989. Combination of the 4-unit plasmids resulted in the all-in-one plasmid pYA4990 which was further confirmed by sequencing. The all-in-one plasmid was designed to transcribe all eight vRNAs and eight mRNAs (10 mRNAs after spliced) in rodent cells. The HA and NA cassettes in pYA4990 were deleted to form a 6-unit plasmid that composes a \u201c1 + 2\u201d plasmid system with the HA and NA plasmids (pYA4969 and pYA4970).",

Homologous DNA recombination among these repetitive sequences impairs plasmid stability. To stably maintain and amplify the plasmid, an E. coli strain with a recA mutation was used. As shown in Fig. 3, plasmid pYA4990 was electroporated into E. coli strain EPI300 (RecA\u2212). A single colony was first inoculated in 3 ml of growth media, and passaged at dilution ratio of 1:1000. DNA recombination was monitored by restriction enzyme digestion of plasmid DNA isolated from different passages. At the fourth passage, there was apparent change in the restriction map of pYA4990, indicating significantly impaired plasmid structure. Qualitative evaluation of the DNA bands on agarose gels suggested that the plasmid structure was stable for the first 3 passages in E. coli strain EPI300. From three independent assays, we observed consistent results. We also tested pYA4490 recombination in another E. coli strain Stbl3 (RecA\u2212) and got similar result (data not shown). In theory, three passages could result in 3 \u00d7 109 ml of bacterial culture for plasmid preparation. Therefore, DNA recombination does not represent a big problem with the all-in-one plasmid when an E. coli strain with a recA mutation is used during cloning and plasmid amplification processes.",

The time-consuming manufacture process and labor-intensive immunization methods of current vaccines render them suboptimal for an influenza pandemic or huge flocks of birds. Recently, we proposed a novel influenza vaccine which composes a bacterial carrier harboring an influenza plasmid [19, 28]. The vaccine can be quickly propagated in simple media in large scale, and potentially be orally administered. In vivo delivery of the influenza plasmid results in generation of attenuated influenza virus which in turn induces protective immunity. The feasibility study showed that such a form of recombinant bacteria could be constructed and used to mediate generation of influenza virus [28]. As expected, there are limiting factors still needing to be overcome, such as inefficient virus generation from the influenza plasmid. In this study we aimed to construct a mouse PolI-driven plasmid for reconstitution of influenza virus, so that we can determine the factors limiting virus generation in the future using well-characterized rodent cell lines.",

Synthesis of these proteins requires four more copies of PolII promoter and terminator sequence. This increase in plasmid size, however, has a negative effect on the nuclear import of plasmid DNA and virus production [19, 36]. To solve this problem, we used a short PolII terminator (SV40 pA) and a truncated less-active CMV promoter (data not shown). With these changes, we made the 21-kb all-in-one plasmid, which is 2.6 kb less in size than the 8-cassette influenza plasmid described previously [19].

The CHO cells, another hamster cell line, only yielded merely detectable influenza virus. One reason is that CHO cells do not have \u03b1-2, 6 SA-linked receptor to support influenza virus propagation [37, 38]. These two hamster cell lines may help determine the mechanism limiting nuclear import of the large size plasmid and the factors inhibiting virus generation.

Since the backbone encoding segments remain the same every year, they can be used to make a 6-cassete plasmid. The 6-cassete plasmid forms a 3-plasmid reverse genetics system with the two plasmids encoding HA and NA genes. This \u201c1 + 2\u201d approach was proven successful in the BHK-21 cells (Table 2). We then tested virus generation in CHO cells which have been used to produce human vaccines and other therapeutics for many years [31]. The all-in-one plasmid could reconstitute low titers of influenza virus in CHO cells, but the \u201c1 + 2\u201d strategy was not successful. This may be overcome by using CHO cells expressing influenza receptor [41\u201343], or coculture of CHO and MDCK cells. On the other hand, it also suggests that a more comprehensive system yields higher titers of virus [18]. The 3-plasmid system should reconstituteseed virus more efficiently than an 8-plasmid system in CEF, Vero cells and MDCK cells [44]. In other circumstance, if one needs to generate a large number of influenza viruses merely different in one gene, such as NP, a 7-cassette plasmid may be constructed to compose a 2-plasmid system with the NP plasmid. If just numerous influenza viruses need to be generated, it is not worth the time to construct a complicated plasmid, and an 8-plasmid system should be used.",

The mouse PolI promoter was found to be active in hamster cell lines, but showed very poor or no activity in MDCK cells. The results suggest that it is an inefficient process to produce the first viral particle in MDCK cells transfected by the all-in-one plasmid as a result of poor vRNA transcription. However, once a live influenza viral particle is generated, it can replicate rapidly in MDCK cells. Like the finding with CHO cells, the 3-plasmid system did not reconstitute influenza virus in MDCK cells. This is because cotransfection of three plasmids into MDCK cells is less efficient than a plasmid, and leads to even less vRNA production in canine cells.",

During gel purification of vector and fragment DNA, UV transillumination causes cross-linking of nucleosides and profoundly reduces transformation frequencies of ligation product, especially for large DNA constructs [48].
