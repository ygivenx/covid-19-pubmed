Underreporting of influenza cases in early stages poses problems in estimating both pandemic severity and transmission intensity. Underreporting stems from the short infectious periods of influenza infections; thus, individuals may recover before seeking treatment from their healthcare provider or before being tracked in a surveillance system. Asymptomatic or mild cases may not even be reported at all. A previous study has shown that official surveillance only reveals a small proportion of actual infections during influenza pandemics [1] \u2013 in some instances the consultation rate in influenza-like illness case-patients was no more than 50%. Furthermore, cases increase exponentially during the initial stage of an outbreak and the limited capacity of surveillance systems, such as limited serological tests, can also lead to underreporting [2].",

From a policy perspective, underreporting can lead to officials underestimating public health risk which in turn affects planning and the implementation of systematic control and prevention activities. For example, there may be a delay in implementing entry screening for travellers or inadequate warning to local and national health departments. The underestimation of incidence and pandemic severity can also reduce education and health notices to the general public about the influenza virus, causing the public not to take measures to protect themselves through vaccines, hand washing, or other control measures. On the other hand, the case-fatality rate would be overestimated as being higher than it actually was due to the missing calculation of asymptomatic and mild cases from the rate denominator [3]. If there is an insufficient system for pandemic control, this situation can place unexpected, unnecessary financial and human resource demands on a healthcare system. Therefore, reliable methods to estimate the reporting rate during early influenza epidemic outbreaks are critical to good public health and infectious disease response systems.",

Although it was not a peak season for an influenza outbreak, routine influenza surveillance identified an unexpected increase in cases of an influenza-like illness in mid-April 2009 [4]. An acute respiratory illness was discovered in two children and further confirmed as a new strain of H1N1 virus. Subsequently, on 26 April 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) notified the public of the new H1N1. Additional cases were soon discovered in the USA [5], and the WHO had raised the H1N1 pandemic alert level to phase 5 by the end of April. At the time, governments and the public still lacked sufficient knowledge about the early stages of the outbreak. At this time, according to H1N1 surveillance data from the Ministry of Health in Mexico, cumulative incidence was measured to be as low as 0\u00b7003% in Mexico's population [6].",

Because surveillance at the borders was quite thorough for influenza-like illness cases even before the H1N1 virus had spread globally, data on early cases such as time of import from the source country is relatively more complete and timely than other available data. For estimating the size and local expansion of the influenza pandemic, this is a valuable data source that also provides a perspective on how the disease is spread.",

Using S, E, I, and R to represent each compartment, the SEIR model has four differential equations describing the rates of subject movement for each time step:In this compartmental model, once a susceptible individual (including local residents and travellers) in compartment S(t) is infected, they move to compartment E(t) and remain there for the latent period. When that latent period is over, they move to compartment I(t) during the infectious period. When the infectious period is over, individuals in compartment I(t) recover and move to compartment R(t). SL is the local susceptible size and ST is the number of travellers from the source country. As ST is far smaller than SL i.e. SL \u226b ST, we approximate",

Since the numbers of asymptomatic and non-severe cases may not have been presented for the observed surveillance time-series data U(t), we used ft(.) to represent a functional form of reporting rates. Therefore, ft(.) is defined as (reported cases/actual cases), ft(.) = U(t)/\u03b1E. The \u03b1E is generated from the SEIR model. We considered two forms of ft(.) in the estimation:\n(1)Constant reporting rate: ft(r) = r,(2)Linearly increasing reporting rate:For parameter estimation, we first iterated the parameters by fixing their values within a grid search. Thus the reproduction number R0 can be fitted into the SEIR model using the least-squares method. We then adopted the earliest times of infected cases imported from Mexico (Ti) and the daily rate of travel (mi) to particular country i. Assuming the travelling cases had the same daily risk of exposure to the influenza virus as local cases, the average imported cases to a country i will be \u03b2miI(t) for time t with mi the daily rate of travel using the fitted SEIR model. Assuming a Poisson event, we assume the probability of importing at least one case from the source country at time t as pi,t =  (1 \u2212 qi)(1\u2212exp[\u2212\u03b2mi\nI(t)]), where qi is the entry screening sensitivity for case detection of country i. Therefore, the estimated time of the first imported case can be simulated as . Iterations were repeated for ranges of fixed values within the grid search. Optimum parameters in ft(.) were obtained with the minimum square root of the sum of standardized squared errors (RSE) between observed data (Ti) and the simulated estimate times of the first cases imported () from Mexico, i.e.We also developed a bootstrap method to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Supposing pairs of resample (Ti*, mi*) were randomly drawn from the original pairs of Ti and mi with replacement, the bootstrapped RSE for the jth iteration of bootstrapping was:One thousand bootstrapped RSE[j] was generated with corresponding fitted parameters. The 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles of the fitted parameters were the lower and upper limits, respectively, of the non-parametric 95% CI over the 1000 samples.",

Even though the strain of pH1N1 virus had been further confirmed in mid-April 2009, the Mexican officials' reporting rates still did not increase. This situation masked the actual growth of pH1N1, leading to a reduction of public awareness and potentially more rapid disease transmission. Inaccurate estimates overstating the risk can provide misleading information to the public and potentially raise levels of anxiety or panic [30].",

In our study, we introduced such a method using existing information available to countries during a pandemic, the time at which imported cases may be arriving from a source country, to estimate reporting rates. According to our results, the estimated epidemic size was larger than officially reported in 2009; we found an estimate of 0\u00b77% cumulative incidence (about 691 000 individuals) in the Mexican population compared to the 0\u00b7003% reported from the Ministry of Health of Mexico [6]. In terms of the epidemic size, our estimates were in line with other studies [2, 31] but were higher than that of Fraser et al. [28]. The reason for the difference is that our approach adopted time-series data for reported incidence, which can help better validate results when using traveller data. Several studies have employed a cross-sectional set of travel data to estimate actual epidemic size but those approaches did not aim to project the epidemic curve or address trends of reporting behaviour.",

With the use of the SEIR model and the estimates, we were also able to estimate that around 0\u00b7005% of the Mexican population was infected prior to the first case being detected by the surveillance system. Therefore, there is a possibility that undetected cases from Mexico, in other countries before the first global case was reported, could have affected our estimates. By using the mathematical model, the probability of having imported case from Mexico for at least one listed country (Table 1) was about 0\u00b721 (results not showed) prior to 14 March 2009. Hence, the early \u2018missing\u2019 detection of imported cases from Mexico was not unexpected.

In our study, we only found 12 countries that reported their confirmed cases with known travel history in Mexico.
