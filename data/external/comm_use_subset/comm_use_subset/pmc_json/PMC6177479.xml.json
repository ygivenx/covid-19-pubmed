As a member of the Arteriviridae family, PRRSV is an enveloped, linear, single positive-stranded RNA virus, and it is similar to the equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus2. PRRSV can be classified into two distinct genotypes: type 1 (European type) and type 2 (North American type)3,4. In vivo, this virus mainly infects pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs)5\u20137, whereas in vitro, MARC-145 cells are a good platform to study viral replication, pathogenesis, and host response8\u201311.",

Signals regarding antisense RNA transcription and regulation were named the antisense pathway, in which PSF (Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated-splicing factor), P54 (Non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) and MATR3 (matrin-3) are major proteins15\u201317. PSF is a DNA- and RNA- binding protein, involved in regulation of signal-induced alternative splicing and homologous DNA pairing18. The PSF-P54 heterodimer associated with MATR3 may play a role in nuclear retention of defective RNAs19. PSF also binds to and represses gene promoter region, such as CTBP1, P53, SMAD3 and P2120,21.",

However, mRNA abundance is not always consistent with protein expression levels23. In recent years, proteomics analysis has been used to identify cellular protein expression profiles related to PRRSV infection24\u201326. Most reports of the proteomics analysis of PRRSV have described two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) approaches24,25,27. In this study, we performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with 2D/LC (liquid chromatography)\u2013MS/MS analysis to detect the comparative protein profile of MARC-145 cells infected with different PRRSV strains28. Three differential virulent strains were used in this study, which are all belong to genotypes: type 2. SX-1 was a highly virulent strain which characterized with a 30aa deletion in nonstructural protein 2 (Nsp2) and isolated from domestic pigs in 200829. The moderate virulent ZCYZ strain with a 54aa deletion in Nsp2 was isolated from hybrid wild boars in 200930. The SD1 strain was a classic PRRSV strain with no deletion in Nsp2 which was mild virulent to pigs and isolated from domestic pigs in 200431. This new method provided novel information regarding the proteomics of MARC-145 cells infected with different PRRSV strains.",

Therefore, MARC-145 cells were transfected with PSF siRNA duplexes designed to specifically silence the expression of the PSF gene. As shown in Fig. 5A, MARC-145 cells transfected with PSF siRNA exhibited an approximately 82% decreased level of endogenous PSF protein compared with the cells transfected with scrambled, noneffective siRNAs (Fig. 5B). The reduction in PSF protein concentration resulted in a significant decrease in viral yield through the TCID50 quantitative method; particularly, a 12.7-fold decrease at 60 hpi was observed in SiPSF-transfected groups compared with scramble-transfected groups (Fig. 5C). However, no significant effect on the viral yield of the ZCYZ or SD1 strains was noted, indicating that PSF has a different effect on the various virulent strains of PRRSV. Taken together, these results revealed that PSF has a unique upregulated expression and is required for the effective infection of the highly virulent PRRSV SX-1 strain.",

            "text": "In Group I (SX-1 vs. MARC-145), the differentially expressed proteins were mostly involved in morphogenesis, protein synthesis, metabolism, stress response, the receptor complex, and endocytosis. FLNB, FLNA, LMNA, and LMNB1 were supposed to involve an alteration of cytoskeletal networks and cellular communication. HSPD1, HSPA8, HSP90AA1, and HSPE1 were related to stress response37. In addition, they acted as molecular chaperones facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes, participating in the translocation of polypeptides across cell membranes and to the nucleus, and aiding in the proper folding of nascent polypeptide chains. HSPA8, also known as HSP70, is mainly found in both the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian cells, playing key roles in the cytosolic endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial import machinery38. The upregulated expression of HSP70 can protect PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells against apoptosis and be conducive to the replication and spread of the virus, indicating that HSP70 is associated with the pathogenesis of this virus. As a member of the annexin family, ANXA2 is highly expressed in eukaryotic cells and localizes in the cytosol39. Precious reports have implicated ANXA2 in the replication of certain viruses39\u201341. Regarding PRRSV, ANXA2 can interact with the PRRSV Nsp9 protein and be incorporated into virions42. Importantly, ANXA2 is beneficial for PRRSV replication in vitro43. The cytoskeleton protein of vimentin (VIM) acts as the receptor complex of PRRSV and forms a complex with Nsp2 by using the viral N protein as an intermediate44,45. CLTC (clathrin) is a major protein component of the cytoplasmic face of intracellular organelles, the so-called coated vesicles and coated pits. It has been reported that the entry of PRRSV into cells occurs by specific binding to the outer cell membrane, followed by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. First, the PRRS virions bind to cell-surface receptors; then, they are delivered intact into the endosome through clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. The entire process was demonstrated and proven using confocal microscopy46\u201348.",

This pathway is the major nonlysosomal process responsible for the breakdown of most short-lived and long-lived proteins in mammalian cells. In addition, this pathway controls various major biological events\u2014avoidance of host immune surveillance, viral maturation and viral progeny release, oncogenesis, transcriptional control, signal transduction, receptor downregulation, and antigen processing\u2014via the breakdown of specific proteins49. Many viruses have been reported to evolve different strategies to utilize this pathway for their own benefits. For example, the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system has been suggested to be required for p53 inactivation, apoptosis suppression, viral transcription, and regulation of the human T-cell leukemia virus 150,51. Adenovirus and coronavirus can also make use of the UPP for ubiquitination52,53. Recently, the ovarian tumor domain of PRRSV Nsp2 was reported to possess ubiquitin-deconjugating activity, which inhibits NF-\u03baB activation through the prevention of i\u03baB\u03b1 degradation by interfering with its polyubiquitination process54. Nsp11 protein, which has a unique and conserved endoribonuclease, inhibits NF-\u03baB activation by specifically removing lysine 48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitin chains55.",

After infection with the PRRSV SX-1 strain, PSF and P54 protein expression was upregulated (Fig. 2A), and the antisense pathway was the most variable of all the significant signaling pathways for the highly virulent SX-1 strain; however, this finding was not observed in the signaling pathways for the moderately virulent ZCYZ strain or the mildly virulent SD1 strain (Fig. 2A). Hence, target-specific RNA interference was used to decrease endogenous PSF protein levels to verify its function in PRRSV infection. After decreasing PSF protein concentration, the viral yield of SX-1 significantly decreased, whereas the viral yield of the ZCYZ and SD1 strains were not significantly affected (Fig. 5), indicating that PSF protein has different functions in various virulent PRRSV strains. As a major protein of the antisense pathway, the silencing of PSF expression is expected to affect antisense pathway function. Accordingly, the molecular mechanism of PSF and antisense pathway function in the infection of different virulent PRRSV strains will be assessed in further research.",
