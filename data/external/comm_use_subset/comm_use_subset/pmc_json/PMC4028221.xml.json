However, the use and misuse of in-feed antibiotics have resulted in serious complications due to drug residues in animal products and increased bacterial resistance. The recognition of these dangers prompted the ban on sub therapeutic usage of antibiotics in many developed countries and some of the developing countries are seriously considering a similar ban. Therefore a viable alternative strategy to antibiotics is essentially needed to combat drug-resistance microorganisms and also to treat the diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy (viral infection) and for individuals with impaired immune systems who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines [3].",

Recently, passive immunization using chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) has become an attractive approach with considerable attention as it possesses a variety of advantages over mammalian IgG such as convenience, high yield and cost-effectiveness. Oral administration of specific chicken IgY has been shown to be effective against a variety of intestinal pathogens especially diarrheal pathogens in different animal classes and humans such as bovine and human rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Salmonella spp. [4]. Although the beneficial effects of chicken IgY in controlling or preventing the diarrheal disease in animals have been known for more than two decades and reported by many researchers globally, it still remains a difficult task to use chicken IgY as an alternative to conventional treatment with strong scientific conclusion. At this juncture, a meta-analysis is necessary and helpful to summarize the previous research findings and provide a comprehensive conclusion and proper direction for further research. The objective of this SR and meta-analysis is to determine the effect of chicken IgY for the treatment and control of diarrhea in domesticated animals using available research reports on IgY against diarrhea in different animal classes like piglets, mice, poultry and claves.",

Normally these diseases are being controlled by administering antibiotics. Nevertheless, the problem of antibiotic resistance has increased dramatically during the past three decades; this may turn into successful treatment more difficult or sometimes impossible and prompted the ban on sub therapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock. Noticeably the sale of antibiotics used in veterinary medicine declined worldwide, for instance 16% of the decline in the sales from 2010 to 2011was reported by European surveillance of veterinary antimicrobial consumption, whereas the Swissmedic declared the fall of 8% in veterinary antibiotics sale in Switzerland during 2012 [74], [75]. Further, the development of novel antimicrobial agents has drastically declined, nevertheless only two new systemic classes of antibiotics (oxazolidinones and cyclic lipopeptides) and two topical classes of antibiotics (pseudomonic acids and pleuromutilins) were introduced in the market during the past 30 years [76]. As a result, the recent scientific publications are pointing out the need for next generation antibiotics. Therefore, new treatment approaches to substitute antibiotics are currently indispensable for combating pathogens. At this juncture, the beneficial effect of IgY likely to be considered for further investigation as a viable alternative to antibiotics. In addition to the bacterial and viral diarrheal diseases in live stock, some economically important intestinal diseases are caused by several different protozoan species; for instance, avian coccidiosis is caused by Eimeria protozoa in the poultry worldwide. In recent years, IgY has also been focused as an alternative control method for the prevention and treatment of protozoan diseases by oral passive immune therapy. Reports on this approach are also clearly evidence the significant protective effect of IgY against Eimeria tenella and Eimeria maxima in chicks. This provide a strong suggestion, that the passive immunization using IgY could be extended to many other gastro intestinal tract diseases caused by microorganisms irrespective of their types and groups [77]\u2013[79].",
