The first wave of infections in spring 2013 (W1, weeks 7/2013\u201340/2013) included 135 cases; whereas 319 cases were reported during the second wave (W2, weeks 41/2013\u201340/2014), 223 cases during the third (W3, weeks 41/2014\u201340/2015), and 121 cases in the fourth wave (W4, weeks 41/2015\u201340/2016). A fifth wave of infections started in October 2016 (W5, week 41/2016), with 235 cases reported as of 24 January 20173. During the first four epidemics, 88% of patients developed pneumonia, 68% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 41% died4. During the ongoing fifth wave, 460 human IAV(H7N9) infections have been reported, including 453 in mainland China; six associated with travel to mainland China from Hong Kong (four cases), Macao (one) and Taiwan (one); and one in an asymptomatic poultry worker in Macao1. Previous analyses indicated that IAV(H7N9) viruses have diverged into two distinct genetic lineages, including the YRD and PRD clades5.",

From Feb-24 to Mar-7, there were 57 cases, with 75.4% (43/57) known to have avian contact2. Therefore, avian contacts are considered to be closely related to human IAV(H7N9) cases. Previous findings have also hinted that live poultry markets (LPMs) play a key role in multiple subtype AIV infecting humans10, 11. We therefore have recently conducted a survey of AIV infections among chickens, ducks, geese and pigeons sold in a LPM in Guangdong province and have found that 2 samples from chickens were positive for AIV. Importantly, our phylogenetic analysis has shown that these novel avian viruses are reassortants of the two distinct genetic lineages of the YRD and PRD clades and that their HA proteins contain the KGKRTAR/G motif with insertion of poly-basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, which has previously been shown to be among the sequences of HP human influenza virus strains. We therefore propose that this HA sequence change observed in the novel AIVs in our study might serve as a potential precursor to those found in HP human H7N9 viruses.",

These birds showed no significant clinical signs. After real time RT-PCR, 2 samples were found to be H7 HA gene positive. These two swab samples were collected from chickens kept in separate cages and sold by different vendors that showed no significant clinical signs.

Q226L/I and G228S substitutions in the HA protein, which are the two main mutations contributing to the high-affinity binding of viruses to human receptors, were not identified in the two novel AIVs. However, several substitutions that may increase the binding ability of the viruses to the human \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor in HA were detected, namely S138A, T160A, and G186V. NS1 E172K, which induces viral replication in mammalian cells, was found in both chicken and human influenza viruses12. Virulence-related signatures P42S and D92E substitutions in the NS1 protein, were also identified. M2 S31N, which confers resistance to amantadine and rimantadine, was found in all these viruses. However, mutations of the NA protein that may cause Oseltamivir resistance, such as E119V and I222L, were not detected in these viruses. Different from human strains, the two AIVs found in this study still harbored known avian influenza virus signatures, e.g. the PB2 E627K mutation was found in 3 human strains, but not in CK/J1 and CK/J2. Meanwhile, PA K356R did not occur in CK/J1 but harbored by the CK/J2 and 3 human viruses (Table 1).\n",

The two novel AIVs CK/J1 and CK/J2 also had similar insertions in the cleavage site of HA protein, but they slightly differed from the human strain signature. The chicken viruses carried the PEVPK\nGKR\nTAR/GLF sequence with only 2 basic amino acid residues inserted (KR) (Fig. 1a). Such amino acid mutations corresponded to nucleotide changes. Specifically, 12 additional nucleotides (AACGGACTGCGA) were found in CK/J1, CK/J2 and the 5 new human isolates, but not in the first 4 epidemics (W1 to W4) strains (Fig. 1b). A nucleic acid mutation G1012A (H7 numbering) was also found in the human strains, but not in CK/J1, CK/J2 and other H7 viruses with the LP cleavage site (Fig. 1b). The HA sequence peak map on the cleavage site regions of CK/J1 and CK/J2 showed a single peak for each nucleotide, which indicates that sequencing results are trustworthy (Fig. 1c). This was the first demonstration of such a molecular sequence-signature characteristic in chicken IAV(H7N9) viruses since their emergence in 2013, according to the alignment of viral HA sequences available in the GISAID database.\n",

            "text": "Analysis was performed based on sequences of each CK/J1 and CK/J2 segment, and those retrieved from the database of GISAID. The sequences of representative IAV(H7N9) viruses sampled during epidemic waves 1 to 5 (Feb 2013 to Jan 2017) from different geographical regions of China originated from avian and human specimens (Supplementary Table S1). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for each gene segment (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) of IAV(H7N9) viruses (Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S4). On the phylogenetic trees, these viruses formed two main distinct genetic clades, including YRD and PRD. As indicated by the trees, some viruses originated from other regions (OR), such as Beijing, Hebei, Jilin, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi and Xinjiang et al., formed small clades among the YRD and PRD lineages (Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S4). Two glycoprotein genes, HA and NA, of the novel AIVs (CK/J1 and CK/J2) and human strains recently found in Guangdong province, all belong to the PRD lineage. As for genetic relationship, these viruses closely related to W3 strains (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). The polymerase tripartite genes (PB2, PB1 and PA) of CK/J1 and CK/J2 were derived from the YRD clade, and close to W3 and W4 viruses. Similar with the two chicken viruses, PB2 of the five Guangdong human isolates also originated from the YRD clade in W3 to W4. However, PA genes of the 5 human strains and PB1 of GD/SP440, GD/HP001 and GD/17SF003 were located in the PRD W3-like lineage, while QY/GIRD1 and GD/17SF006 were located in the OR clade W3-like branch (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). NP genes of the two avian and five human strains were closely related to W3 to W5 strains. Except QY/GIRD1 and GD/17SF006 strains, which derived from PRD, the NP genes of other 5 strains originated from the YRD clade (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure S3). The M and NS genes of all 7 viruses derived from the YRD clade. The M genes of avian and human strains had close genetic relationship with W3 to W4 viruses (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure S4). Although all NS genes originated from the YRD clade, they derived from different epidemic periods. CK/J1 was genetically closely related to the W3 viruses, and CK/J2 to the W1 to W2 strains. NS genes of the 5 human viruses were from W4 strains. As a common ancestor of IAV(H7N9) virus, all segment genes of A/Shanghai/1/2013(H7N9) (termed as SH/1) derived from the YRD clade. From the phylogenetic trees, polymerase tripartite and NS genes were close to avian strains instead of human ones (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figures S1, S2 and S4).\n",

From W1 to W5, both HA and NA genes were clustered into two big clades, namely Clades I and II. The HA and NA genes which clustered into Clade II originated from the YRD and OR regions. The TMRCA of two glycoproteins genes in Clade II was estimated from March 2012 to July 2012 with the mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were 2012.573 and 2012.346, respectively, and 95% HPD of HA and NA genes were 2012.333~2012.737 and 2011.988~2012.618, respectively (Figs 3A and 4A). Most viruses clustered in this clade were of the avian source strains. Two genes which clustered in Clade I were in all affected regions (YRD, PRD and OR). TMRCA of both two genes in Clade I was estimated to be Jan 2012 to May 2012 with the mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were 2012.3803 and 2012.2024, respectively, and 95% HPD of HA and NA were 2012.123~2012.635 and 2011.793~2012.491, respectively (Figs 3C and 4C). In Clade I, IAV(H7N9)\u2019s HA genes developed into two lineages, i.e. Clade I-A and Clade I-B. Similar with the HA genes, after April 2012, most of the NA genes of IAV(H7N9) in Clade I formed two main lineages (also termed as Clade I-A and Clade I-B). Both HA and NA genes of most viruses included in Clade I-A were from the PRD region, with most of avian source. This lineage was estimated to start around May 2012 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were, 2012.4597 and 2012.4256, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA were 2012.261~2012.623 and 2012.425~2012.426, respectively) (Figs 3D and 4D). The Clade I-B was estimated to start around June 2012 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were 2012.498 and 2012.529, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA were 2012.305~2012.616 and 2012.456~2012.550, respectively) (Figs 3E and 4E).

However, from the estimated time from August to October of 2013 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were, 2013.9618 and 2013.8686, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA were 2013.383~2014.000 and 2013.732~2013.900, respectively), a small branch virus began circulating in the PRD region (Figs 3F and 4F). Importantly, all the HA and NA genes of novel HP mutant strains, including human and chicken strains, originated from this branch. The TMRCA of HP mutant strains was estimated at around July 2015 to March 2016 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were 2016.0987 and 2015.8818, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA were 2015.612~2016.561 and 2015.341~2016.279, respectively) (Figs 3F and 4F). According to overlap of the 95% HPD range of HA and NA genes, the two novel AIV strains CK/J1 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were, 2016.0987 and 2015.8818, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA genes were 2015.612~2016.561 and 2015.341~2016.279, respectively) and CK/J2 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were, 2016.2525 and 2016.0375, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA genes were 2015.794~2016.664 and 2015.584~2016.431, respectively) were estimated to appear earlier (the CK/J1 strain was estimated to appear from July 2015 to March 2016, while CK/J2 appeared from September 2015 to May 2016) or had 3 months of overlapped time period (March-May 2016) with the human strain GD/17SF003 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were, 2016.5776 and 2016.6254, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA genes were 2016.107~2016.882 and 2016.312~2016.83, respectively) which was estimated to appear from March to September 2016 (Figs 3F, 4F and 5). According to the molecular clock analysis results of both HA and NA genes, those two novel AIV strains appeared significantly earlier than the human counterparts, such as QY/GIRD1 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were 2016.9366 and 2016.4983, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA genes were 2016.708~2017.000 and 2016.115~2016.769, respectively) and GD/17SF006 (mean TMRCA values of HA and NA genes were 2016.9366 and 2016.6254, respectively; 95% HPD of HA and NA genes were 2016.708~2017.000 and 2016.312~2016.83, respectively), with estimated TMRCA from August to September 2016 (Figs 3F, 4F and 5). Together with the results of molecular clock analysis of HA and NA genes of the novel HP IAV(H7N9), we further confirmed that the avian HP strains appeared months earlier than those human strains during the evolution process.\n",

Since we only collected samples from one LPM, this finding does not necessarily represent the entire situation of the ongoing 5th epidemic of influenza virus infections in China, but it still reveals a potential threat on public health. In this study, all the sampled birds, including the sources of CK/J1 and CK/J2, showed no significant clinical signs. It is known that occasionally an H5 or H7 virus causes only mild illness in chickens and turkeys, although it has a genetic signature that classifies it as an HPAI virus14\u201316. According to the amino acid signature analysis in our study, this may be related to the non-continuous basic amino acid insertion in the HA cleavage site, different from human HP strains; a further study is required to verify the relationship between such differences and viral pathogenicity17. The 226Q and 228G amino acids in the HA protein and/or the 627E and 701D in the PB2 protein indicate that such viruses may still adapt to the avian species18, 19. However, these viruses also show some human or mammalian receptor binding characteristics, such as the 138 A, 160 A, 186 V in the HA proteins, indicating their potential adaption to human 2,6-linked sialic acid receptor20\u201322. A study on the recent human HP H7N9 strains GD/17SF003 and GD/17SF006, which both carried the amino acids insertion on HA cleavage site suggested their preference for both avian- and human-type receptors23. Considering the LPM plays a critical role in AIV spread to humans, birds with no significant clinical signs may still shed viruses during breeding and growing in farms, transportation and sale in LPMs, which may not be easily noticed. This would increase the risk of AIV spreading to humans and other animals10. In such conditions, annual systematic and comprehensive monitoring of IAV(H7N9) should be conducted in LPMs in Guangdong province and potentially elsewhere.",

The avian strains harbored two surface glycoprotein genes (HA and NA) from PRD clades while the other six internal genes were from the YRD clade (Fig. 2). Different from chicken strains, the human strains in Guangdong province during the fifth wave carried two different genotypes; QY/GIRD1 and GD/17SF006, which contained genes from three clades (PB2, M and NS from YRD; PA, HA, NP and NA from PRD; PB1 from OR). GD/SP440, GD/HP001 and GD/17SF003 contained genes from two clades (PB2, NP, M and NS from YRD; the remaining genes from PRD)13. These results indicate that the two main IAV(H7N9) sources were YRD and PRD, corroborating previous findings13. In addition, the results suggest that IAV(H7N9) viruses with different genotypes are co-circulating in avian and humans7, 13. Moreover, the surface glycoprotein genes, HA and NA of the two avian and five human strains derived from wave 3 are similar to the PRD lineage viruses. According to Wu and colleagues, genes located in such lineage began to circulate in central region of Guangdong province in wave 224. Some genes of the two novel AIVs CK/J1 and CK/J2, such as HA, NA, NP and M, were closely related to human strain lineages20\u201322, 25. However, unlike genes of those 5 human strains, the polymerase tripartite and NS genes of CK/J1 and CK/J2 were closely related to avian strains, indicating that such genes may still circulate and undergo adaptation in poultries of Guangdong.",

Such results suggest that the newly identified IAV(H7N9) with HP status may have obtained some of the HP mutations in chicken before adaptation to humans26. As shown by the molecular clock study, nine of thirteen viruses in the branch containing the HA gene of novel HP IAV(H7N9) strains were of human sources; only four viruses were avian, including CK/J1 and CK/J2 (Fig. 3F). Taken together, molecular clock analysis, molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the two novel AIV strains may constitute an intermediary virus during IAV(H7N9) spread among avian and humans. However, direct evidence to show that these novel AIVs transmit from avian to humans remains to be demonstrated.",

However, since their full genomes have been obtained, these novel AIV can potentially be reconstructed through reverse genetics (e.g., in collaboration with researchers with a BSL-3 lab) for further basic virology research. Secondly, sample collection was carried out in a single day at one LPM; therefore, the results could not be generalized to the whole region and for a longer period of time. Additional surveys with longer time frame and in more sampling sites (e.g., in poultry farms and LPMs in southern China, including but not necessarily limited to Fujian, Hunan, Guangxi and Hainan provinces besides Guangdong province) are being planned. The results from these additional studies will be described in subsequent reports.",

According to the divergence time scale, these two AIV strains seemed to have appeared months before the isolation of the human HP strains in Guangdong province. Therefore, the acquired poly-basic insertion in the novel AIVs may be attributed to persistent circulation in poultry species and may serve as intermediary viruses to human infections. Further investigation is required to determine whether the poly-basic HA cleavage site of the IAV(H7N9) virus is associated with increased avian and/or human disease severity. The molecular characteristics of these novel chicken AIV strains highlight challenges in risk assessment of IAV(H7N9) infections at the human-animal interface.",
