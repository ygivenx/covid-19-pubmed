            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected more than 8 thousand patients in 22 countries causing 774 deaths between July 2002 and September 2003 [1]. SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the causative agent [2]. Typical clinical manifestations include fever, cough, dyspnea and rapid progression of pulmonary infiltration or consolidation [3]. The mean mortality rate is 9.6% [1], mostly attributed to hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the acute phase, typical pathological findings in the lungs include mononuclear cells infiltration, alveolar cell desquamation and hyaline membrane formation [4]. Those mononuclear cells may develop into multinucleated giant cells [4]. Proinflammatory cytokines released by alveolar macrophages may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis in SARS [5]. Marked elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12, of the Th1 cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, and of chemokines IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IFN-\u03b1-induced protein-10 (IP-10) have been reported [6]. High resolution Computed tomography (HRCT) findings at presentation include as unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral or bilateral areas of consolidation [7-9]. Such residual abnormalities have been described also after discharge from hospital at 36.5 days and at 6-months [10,11]. However, limited information is available on recovery of inflammatory abnormalities during recovery from SARS, particularly at 60 days and beyond..",

These patients received variable therapy regimens, including oral ribavirin (1 g twice a day for 5\u20137 days), or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 1 g/kg body weight/day for 2 days), pulse steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 500 mg twice a day for 3 days and then prednisolone 1 mg/kg body weight/day for 5 days), or maintenance corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 10 mg twice a day for more than 3 weeks). Pulse steroid therapy was administered within 3 days of the onset of fever in some patients, depending on the attending physicians' decision irrespective of severity of presentation. Some patients who did not receive pulse steroid therapy were given a short course of corticosteroid therapy (hydrocortisone 100 mg 3 times/day for 3 days) if there was rapid deterioration of pulmonary infiltration or hypoxemia. Maintenance steroid therapy (prednisolone 10 mg per day for one week) was given after pulse or short course corticosteroid therapy in all patients.

The extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of three zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below carina up to the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein). Each lung zone (total of 6 lung zones) was assigned a score, modified from previously described [9], based on the following: 0 when no involvement, 1 when <25% involvement, 2 when 25 <50% involvement; 3 when 50% <75% involvement and 4 when 75% involvement.

Despite the relatively low numbers, our observations indicate that there are persistent important inflammatory and radiological abnormalities in some patients who have recovered from acute SARS at 60 days after the illness. These changes were those of ground-glass or/and consolidation abnormalities which may be overlooked on examination of plain chest radiographs. The BAL fluid examination performed for the first time in recovering SARS patients confirmed the presence of an on-going active inflammatory process in most patients with increased macrophages, NK cells and T cells, and augmented levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory responses may be elicited by the persistent presence of coronavirus in alveolar macrophages, since the patients with the highest HRCT changes had coronaviruses present and there was no evidence of bacterial or other viral infection in these patients.",

The CXC-chemokines, such as IL-8 or GRO-\u03b1, are major neutrophil chemoattractants [23]. MIG/CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9 and IP-10/CXCL10, both inducible by interferon-\u03b3, are ELR-negative CXC chemokines and are potent chemoattractants for mononuclear cells, specifically activated T lymphocytes and NK cells [24]. In this report, we demonstrated elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES and IL-8 in BAL fluid in SARS patients compared to those of normal subjects. Increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 may be derived from virus-infected macrophages or from CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, and these cytokines may promote T-lymphocyte extravasation and macrophage activation [19], but such processes may not be sufficient on their own to recruit and activate mononuclear cells in virus-infected lungs. The increased levels of MCP-1 and RANTES in BAL fluid of all SARS patients may be responsible for the generation of mononuclear infiltrates observed after coronavirus infection. IP-10 and MIG, whose levels are also increase in SARS patients, recruit monocytes and macrophages, NK cells and activated, but not resting T lymphocytes [25,26].",

The absence of neutrophil infiltration in influenza A virus or respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) infection is attributed to the suppression of neutrophil attracting CXC-chemokines or by induction of IL-10 [27]. However, IL-8 production can be induced by measles virus infection of fibroblasts [28] and by influenza A virus, RSV and rhinovirus in pulmonary epithelial cells or AM [28-31]. The reasons for the lack of neutrophil recruitment in response to elevated IL-8 levels in SARS patients are not known and this deserves further investigation.",

The HRCT and the clinical course until the 90th day of illness did not suggest any evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in SARS patients. This was in accord with the low level of cytokines and growth factors responsible for tissue repairing and fibrosis [32], such as IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2, IGF-1, and EGF detected in BAL fluid. However, evidence of fibrosis on HRCT has been obtained on HRCT scans particularly in patients with very severe disease during the acute phase of SARS [33].",

Pulse steroid therapy was reported to lead to less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood to require rescue pulse steroid therapy than their counterparts [34]. However, corticosteroids have been shown to increase mortality of pneumovirus-infected mice by accelerating replication of virus [35]. Pulse steroid therapy was also reported to be associated with residual abnormality on HRCT in SARS patients after discharge from hospital [10]. In the current retrospective, non-randomized series, pulse steroid therapy appeared to be associated with delayed resolution of pneumonitis. We have planned a prospective future study on investigating the effect of pulse steroid therapy in case of future outbreaks of SARS. This is because this issue is extremely important in outcome from SARS.",

This was associated with persistent inflammatory response characterized by macrophages, T cells particularly CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, and by increase in cytokines and chemokines. This host inflammatory response against SARS-CoV infection may contribute to persistent HRCT abnormalities during recovery phase of SARS. On the other hand, we found no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in SARS patients during recovery. At day 90, many of the abnormalities have disappeared. Patients recovering from SARS need to be followed up for at least 3 months after the infection.",
