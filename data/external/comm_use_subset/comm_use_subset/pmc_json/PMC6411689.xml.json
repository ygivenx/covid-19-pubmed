            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), which was first identified in 1977\u20131978, causes acute gastroenteritis and leukopenia in dogs. A new antigenic variant (CPV-2a) completely replaced the originally identified CPV-2 virus between 1979 and 1980. Additional antigenic variants, CPV-2b and CPV-2c, were identified in 1984 (Parrish et al., 1991) and 2000 (Buonavoglia et al., 2001), respectively. Novel antigenic variants of CPV-2a/2b are still being identified, including new CPV-2a, new CPV-2b (Ohshima et al., 2008), Asp-300(2a), and Asp-300(2b) (Ikeda et al., 2000). Today, the CPV-2 variant originally identified in 1977 can only be found in some vaccine strains. The primary determinants of the CPV-2 genotype are codons 84, 87, 101, 297, 300, 425, and 426 in the VP2 protein (Decaro et al., 2006a,b,c; Yoon et al., 2009; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012; Bingga et al., 2014).",

Furthermore, these live vaccines may replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and are shed along with the feces of vaccinated dogs (Gizzi et al., 2014), which has been suspected to interfere with diagnostic tests for clinical signs of acute gastroenteritis. As variants of CPV-2 emerged, the CPV-2 vaccine appeared to provide relatively lower and shorter immunity against heterologous CPVs (Decaro et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010). This observation can lead to a diagnostic dilemma when pups that have been administered with a CPV-2 vaccine recently present with clinical signs of acute gastroenteritis (Decaro et al., 2007). Based on these findings, CPV-2 variants need to be identified effectively for diagnosis and epidemiological monitoring.",

            "text": "Several approaches have been employed to type CPV-2 based on serological assays, such as the hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test using monoclonal antibodies (Nakamura et al., 2003) and by molecular methods, like multiplex amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) (Chander et al., 2016), mini-sequencing based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis (Naidu et al., 2012; Pavana Jyothi et al., 2016), peptide nucleic acid-based (PNA) array (An et al., 2012), multiplexed tandem PCR (MT-PCR) (Meggiolaro et al., 2017), probe based minor binding groove assays (MBG assay) (Decaro et al., 2006a,b,c), high resolution melting curve analysis (HRM) and sequence analysis. However, HI testing needs at least four monoclonal antibodies (Nakamura et al., 2003) to identify CPV-2 variants, and most of the molecular methods need at least two reactions (Decaro et al., 2006a,b,c; An et al., 2012; Naidu et al., 2012; Bingga et al., 2014; Chander et al., 2016; Pavana Jyothi et al., 2016) or/and two technologies (An et al., 2012; Naidu et al., 2012; Bingga et al., 2014; Pavana Jyothi et al., 2016; Meggiolaro et al., 2017); Sequence analysis is regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for CPV-2 genotyping, it is still time consuming, and labor intensive; In our previous study, PCR coupled with high resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis has been developed to genotype CPV-2 variants (Bingga et al., 2014). HRM is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for CPV-2 genotyping; however, it is not feasible for detecting multiple mutation sites of CPV-2 variants in a single test tube using DNA binding dye. In addition, due to the very small melting temperature difference (0.2\u00b0C), genotyping CPV-2 variants had to be performed by generating heteroduplexes in HRM analysis (Bingga et al., 2014). Probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA), however, could overcome those limitations mentioned above.",

With the probe-based FMCA method, the large range of melting temperature difference, 4\u201310\u00b0C, can be caused by only one or two SNPs and by using different fluorescence channels, it is possible to detect significantly greater mutation sites in one reaction tube (El Housni et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2018). Thus, to increase the discriminatory power comes from the melting temperature for genotyping CPV-2 variants, probe-based FMCA method was developed to detect the same mutant sequence in this study.",

Compared with TaqMan probe-based FMCA, HRM is a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method for SNP testing. In our laboratory, PCR coupled with HRM curve analysis has also been developed to genotype Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) variants (Bingga et al., 2014). However, HRM analysis encounters technical difficulties when different CPV-2 genotypes from one sample need to be detected simultaneously in a single reaction tube. This problem can be solved using probe-based FMCA. The advantage of probe-based FMCA is its ability for multiplex detection using probe with specific melting temperatures. When the template DNA fully matches with the probe sequence, the probe will bind at the specific melting temperature. If the template DNA has a mismatch with the probe, the melting temperature will decrease remarkably compared with the matched hybrids. Thus, the Tm difference (\u0394Tm) between the fully matched hybrid and the mismatched hybrids allows researchers to detect SNP variations in a single reaction tube.",

In solution, the randomly coiled conformation enables fluorescence quenching because the quencher and the fluorophore remain in proximity to each other. Thus, a non-hybridized TaqMan probe is only weakly fluorescent. When the probe hybridizes with its target, strong fluorescence occurs because the quencher and fluorophore are separated by the length of the probe. After denaturation from the probe-target hybrid, the probe returns to its weakly fluorescent, randomly coiled conformation.",

This probe allows a 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the CPV-2b VP2 gene region (A4062G), and a 2-bp mismatched hybridization with CPV-2c (A4062G and T4064A). The result of FMCA showed that the melting temperature differences (\u0394Tms) between the fully matched hybrid and the mismatched hybrids were 6.85 \u00b1 0.22\u00b0C and 9.86 \u00b1 0.29\u00b0C for 1- and 2-bp mismatched hybridization, respectively. Therefore, the \u0394Tm values were sufficient to classify the three melting temperatures clearly in a single detection experiment for CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c. However, one limitation was that using only the FAM-labeled probe, the assay could not discriminate CPV-2a from the original CPV-2, as both strains have similar nucleic acids at the target sequence (Figure 1A). Thus, a HEX-labeled TaqMan probe was produced to distinguish the original CPV-2 from CPV-2a strains, based on the melting temperature difference. The HEX-labeled TaqMan probe was designed to perfectly match with the target sequence of original CPV-2, in which other strain of CPV-2 variants have a 1-bp mismatch (A3045T). This mismatched hybridization resulted in a \u0394Tm of 5.35 \u00b1 0.18\u00b0C between original CPV-2 and CPV-2a. In addition, two attenuated live vaccine strains (CPVpf and CPVint) were also successfully identified using the two TaqMan probes, because of mutations A4061G and A3038G in the corresponding target sequences (Figure 1).",

In our laboratory, co-infection sample CPV-js11, containing CPV-2a and CPV-2b, was detected by HRM analysis in a previous study (Bingga et al., 2014). In the present study, two strains from the mixed sample of CPV-js11 were readily distinguished using the probe-based FMCA method. In comparison with the HRM method, the co-infected sample was directly identified by probe-based FMCA without using a mixing control, only a pure control is required (Figure 2). This is because the mixed sample contains both heteroduplex and homoduplex species after PCR, and the melting curve of the co-infected sample is a combination of their melting profiles (Montgomery et al., 2007). In the HRM assay, the higher melting temperature peak was a combination of two homoduplex melting profiles, and the lower melting temperature peak was also a combination of two heteroduplex melting profiles. In the probe-based FMCA, however, the higher melting temperature peak was derived from one duplex melting profile, which was perfectly matched with the probe; the lower melting temperature peak was derived from one duplex melting profile, which was mismatched with the probe. Thus, the components of the mixed sample were detected by the labeled probes directly from the four duplexes in the probe-based FMCA assay; however, it is not feasible to identify the ingredients in the co-infected sample using the intercalating dyes-based HRM assay without using a mixing control.",
