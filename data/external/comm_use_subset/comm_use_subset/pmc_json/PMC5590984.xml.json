Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the only domestic animals that can be definitive hosts for T. gondii.

In this method, possible immunoglobulin M antibodies are denatured by 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were diluted 1:40, and samples that tested positive were defined as seropositive. All plates contained the positive and negative controls provided with the kit in two dilutions (1:40 and 1:4000), and antigen control. We read the results after 18 hours of incubation.

A similar proportion of kittens was included in this study as in the Finnish study [24], whereas the larger proportion of kittens included in this study than in the Estonian study [25] could partly explain that difference. All these estimates of seroprevalence are conservative and likely underestimate T. gondii infection prevalence, because the method used is indirect and detects only immunoglobulin G antibodies. Recently infected cats have not produced these antibodies yet and appear seronegative. Moreover, using a single dilution, we expected few cats with high antibody titers to test seronegative because of the prozone phenomenon [24].",

The lynxes that originated from the south-west of Finland had a significantly higher T. gondii seroprevalence than the lynxes from north-east [27]. Similarly, the seroprevalence in moose and sheep was higher in south-western and lower in northern parts of Finland [28]. It is unknown whether the gradient in T. gondii prevalence is present also in small prey that domestic cats that are allowed to hunt could catch, but the seroprevalence in cats living near the capital city, located in the south, was similar to that in cats from other parts of the country [24]. For each cat included in this study, in addition to breed, we had data on the known major risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity: age, whether the cat was receiving raw meat, and whether the cat had outdoor access. Because the infection is usually acquired and seroprevalence increases with age (as shown also in this study), these risk factors were relevant to include in the analyses. In particular, raw meat given to the cats by the owners is a major lifestyle risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity in Finland [24]. In this study, in addition to the breed of the cat, the age of the cat and whether it was receiving raw meat were statistically significant variables in the final multivariable model for T. gondii seropositivity.

The only wild felid living in Finland is the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), which has not been shown to shed T. gondii oocysts [27]. The domestic cat is considered to be the most important host species of T. gondii evolutionarily and also epidemiologically for example in regions where domestic cats outnumber the other definitive hosts [2, 24, 27]. Most seropositive cats are considered to have previously shed oocysts in their feces [1]. From serology results, we can thus retrospectively conclude that a high proportion of cats of a breed with high T. gondii seroprevalence has shed T. gondii oocysts, while the proportional potential contribution to the environmental oocyst contamination by cats of a breed with lower seroprevalence has been smaller. It is unknown whether shedding of T. gondii oocysts (length of the shedding period, number of oocysts shed) differs by domestic cat breed.",
