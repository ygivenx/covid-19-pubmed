            "text": "Regulation of protein degradation plays a key role in many cellular processes ranging from cell cycle progression, innate immunity, and antigen presentation to the turnover of misfolded or oxidized proteins. Most degradation is carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Ubiquitin is added to proteins by a cascade of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, resulting in a polyubiquitinated protein which is subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. As a means to regulate protein function, it is no surprise that many viruses have co-opted the UPS for their own benefit. Viruses can promote proteasome degradation of antiviral host proteins either by encoding their own E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting proteins to a cellular E3 ligase, or even inducing ubiquitin-independent degradation of targets. Examples of viral E3 ligases include the herpes simplex virus-1 protein ICP0 [1] and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus proteins K3 and K5 (for a review, see [2]). Viral proteins that can hijack a cellular E3 ligase include human immunodeficiency virus-1 vpr and vif (for a review, see [3]), paramyxovirus V [4], and human papillomavirus E6 and E7 (for a review, see [5]). Finally, the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein pp71 uses a ubiquitin-independent mechanism to target the Rb and hDaxx proteins [6], [7]. In fact, pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome blocks multiple stages of the viral life cycle, suggesting that viruses rely on activities of the UPS for their replication [8]\u2013[12]. On the other hand, viruses must also modulate cellular E3 ligase activity in order to replicate because ubiquitination regulates many important cellular processes central to virus infection. The SV40 large T antigen inhibits the SCFfbw7 ubiquitin ligase to increase cyclin E levels [13], and influenza virus NS1 inhibits TRIM 25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I, thereby attenuating interferon production [14].",

It has at least eleven subunits and two co-activator proteins (CDC20 (cell-division cycle protein 20) and Cdh1 (CDC20 homologue 1)), which are separated into three sub-complexes. These include the cullin-ring ligase domain (composed of APC2, 10, and 11), the specificity arm (composed of APC3, 6, 7, and 8), and the bridge (composed of APC1, 4, and 5). Cdh1 and CDC20 activate APC activity to prevent premature entry into S phase and to promote progression through mitosis, respectively. The APC complex ubiquitinates more than 40 proteins, including A- and B- type cyclins, to regulate their stability. It also regulates degradation of its own coactivator proteins, Cdh1 and CDC20, as a form of feedback regulation. Due to its central role in cell cycle progression, the APC is also a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics [16].",

This virus stimulates cell cycle progression of quiescent cells into an S phase-like environment but concurrently blocks host DNA synthesis [25]. HCMV promotes cell cycle progression likely in part by inactivating Rb [6], [26] and regulating the APC [24], [27], [28]. It has been reported that HCMV has two means to regulate the APC. The multifunctional viral kinase pUL97 phosphorylates the APC coactivator Cdh1, thus likely inhibiting its activity [24]. Nonetheless, abrogation of UL97 alone only results in a modest increase in APC activity during infection [24]. Independent of UL97-mediated Cdh1 regulation, HCMV also induces degradation of two APC subunits, APC4 and APC5, leading to the dissociation of the complex during infection [24]. The viral factor and associated mechanism responsible for regulating degradation of the APC subunits have not been identified.",

Expression of pUL21a dissociates the APC cullin-ring ligase subcomplex from its specificity arm. This regulation alters APC activity and increases levels of a subset of APC-regulated cell cycle proteins. We have identified residues proline-arginine (PR109-110) in pUL21a to be critical for its ability to bind and regulate the APC. A mutant virus in which the viral ability to regulate the APC is abrogated by both alanine substitution of proline-arginine residues in pUL21a and UL97 deletion is markedly more defective compared to the pUL97 deletion virus alone. This suggests that HCMV has evolved an invasive strategy of using both viral factors to regulate the APC to facilitate its infection. Our study has identified the HCMV protein pUL21a as a novel APC regulator and elucidated a unique mechanism to subvert APC activity.",

One identified function of this protein is to facilitate efficient viral DNA synthesis [30]. However, this protein shares no significant homology with any known protein. To provide mechanistic insight into its activity, we used a proteomics approach to identify interacting partners of pUL21a during infection. We created a recombinant virus (ADgfpUL21a) in which the UL21a coding sequence was tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence. This virus grew with wild-type kinetics, and the tagged protein was fortuitously much more stable than native pUL21a [29]. A GFP tag can stabilize certain fusion proteins [31], and made it possible to detect interacting proteins in our study. We infected fibroblasts with either ADgfpUL21a or control HCMV (ADgfp) that expressed free GFP only. At 48 hours post infection (hpi), we isolated the protein complexes from infected cells by a rapid one-step immunoaffinity purification on magnetic beads coated with GFP antibody-coupled protein A. Electrophoresis analysis revealed multiple protein bands that were specific to the pUL21a-containing sample (Figure 1A). We analyzed pUL21a-specific protein bands by mass spectrometry and identified the proteins depicted with arrows as APC specificity arm subunits, APC3, APC7, and APC8 (Table S1).",

We created a series of truncation mutations targeting each region in the GFP-tagged pUL21a, and tested the ability of mutant UL21a proteins to interact with the APC in 293T cells (Figure 2B). All mutants were expressed at similar levels and were efficiently immunoprecipitated by the GFP antibody (Figure 2C, and data not shown). As expected, full-length gfpUL21awt co-immunoprecipitated both APC3 and APC8 while the gfpUL21astop mutant did not. Importantly, while the carboxyl-terminal fragment of pUL21a consistently co-immunoprecipitated APC3 and APC8, the amino-terminal and middle fragments were unable to do so.

Substitutions of the adjoining non-conserved residues (PH111-112AA) had no effect on APC binding. To validate the result in the context of infection, we constructed recombinant HCMV viruses expressing GFP-tagged or native forms of PR109-110AA or PH111-112AA pUL21a variants (ADgfpUL21aPR-AA, ADgfpUL21aPH-AA, ADpmUL21aPR-AA, and ADpmUL21aPH-AA).

To test if pUL21a was required for these events, we first examined APC subunit accumulation during infection with or without pUL21a. Levels of APC4 and APC5 proteins were markedly reduced during wild-type infection relative to mock-infected cells at 24 hpi (Figure 3A). However, no reduction was observed in APC4 and APC5 levels during infection with the UL21a-deletion virus. The pUL21a-deficient virus fails to express late viral genes due to a defect in viral DNA synthesis [30]. To rule out any role of late genes in APC4 and APC5 degradation, we treated infected cells with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) to block viral DNA synthesis and late gene expression. APC4 and APC5 levels were reduced during infection with wild-type virus but remained elevated during infection with the UL21a-deletion virus, even following PAA treatment. Furthermore, there was no appreciable difference in APC4 and APC5 transcript levels between wild-type and deletion virus infections (Figure 3B). These data suggest that the changes in APC4 and APC5 protein levels occur at the level of protein stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, MG132 enhanced APC4 and APC5 protein levels during infection with wild-type but not deletion virus (Figure 3C). Thus, pUL21a-mediated loss of APC4 and APC5 was due to proteasomal degradation. Moreover, the APC binding mutant virus ADpmUL21aPR-AA was unable to degrade APC4 and APC5 while the ADpmUL21aPH-AA virus was as efficient as the wild-type control virus. These data support the conclusion that pUL21a binding to the APC promotes proteasomal degradation of APC4 and APC5.",

In this experiment, we used APC3 and APC10 as the marker for the specificity arm and cullin-ring ligase subcomplex of the APC, respectively. These two subcomplexes sit on opposite sides of the APC. APC10 has been proposed to bind APC substrates along with coactivator proteins, including Cdh1 [32]. APC10 associates with APC2 and APC11 of the ligase subcomplex, but its location in the inner cavity of the APC allows for contact with APC3 and APC6 of the specificity arm. In cells infected with ADpmUL21aPR-AA, total levels of APC3 and APC10 were similar to those in cells infected with ADpmUL21aPH-AA, allowing for a direct analysis of the efficiency of their association with the complex (Figure 3D). APC3 could not co-immunoprecipitate APC10 in ADpmUL21aPH-AA-infected cells, consistent with dissociation of the complex in the presence of functional pUL21a. In cells infected with ADpmUL21aPR-AA, APC3 was able to pull down APC10 efficiently, indicating that the two subcomplexes remained associated. Finally, the integrity of the APC during ADpmUL21aPH-AA infection was largely restored upon addition of MG132, even though total protein levels were reduced likely due to MG132-induced cell death (Figure 3D, and data not shown). These data were recapitulated during infection of wild-type and UL21a deletion viruses (Figure S3). Our data provides strong evidence supporting the model that binding of pUL21a to the APC induces degradation of the APC bridge arm resulting in complex dissociation.",

To test this, we depleted APC8 in these cells by shRNA knockdown (Figure S4). Following shRNA depletion of APC8, the APC4 and APC5 levels remained reduced in cells infected with wild-type virus compared to those with UL21a-deletion virus, even though APC knockdown did seem to affect the overall stability of APC4 and APC5 in pUL21a-independent manner (Figure S4).

The geminin transcript accumulated to wild-type levels even without pUL21a, providing evidence that the difference in protein accumulation was not due to transcriptional regulation (Figure 4B). PAA treatment had no effect on substrate accumulation, ruling out pUL21a-mediated late gene expression as the source of the observed phenotype (Figure S5A). MG132 largely restored substrate levels during UL21a deletion viral infection, indicating that the difference is likely due to increased proteasome degradation (Figure 4C).

Importantly, APC8 knockdown restored geminin and Cdh1 levels in cells infected with ADpmUL21aPR-AA or ADsubUL21a virus to those with ADpmUL21aPH-AA or ADgfp virus. Likewise, Cdh1 knockdown restored geminin levels in cells infected with the pUL21a-deficient viruses.

In fact, Cdh1 from both wild type and UL21a mutant virus infected cells migrated slower in an SDS-PAGE gel compared to that from mock cells, which was previously shown to be due to phosphorylation (Figure 4E) [28].

We constructed a HeLa cell line stably expressing a GFP-tagged TetR (tetracycline repressor) gene. We then transduced this cell line with lentiviruses expressing pUL21astop, pUL21aPH-AA, or pUL21aPR-AA under a CMV-TetO (tetracycline operator) promoter. pUL21a protein accumulation was only detected in the presence of tetracycline, suggesting tight regulation of pUL21a expression (Figure 5A), although its levels were significantly lower than those expressed in transiently transfected cells (Figure S7A). Importantly, the addition of tetracycline significantly reduced APC4 and APC5 protein levels in cells expressing pUL21aPH-AA, but not pUL21astop or pUL21aPR-AA. To assess the consequence of pUL21a on APC activity, we synchronized cells expressing pUL21aPH-AA (i.e. wild-type pUL21a) in mitosis with nocodazole and then assayed their ability to progress out of mitosis after release from nocodazole treatment. In the absence of tetracycline and pUL21a, cells readily progressed through the mitotic phase following release. In the experiment shown in Figure 5B, 26% and 48% of cells entered the next G1 phase by 2 and 4 hours, respectively. In the presence of tetracycline where pUL21a was expressed, progression through the mitotic phase was clearly delayed. As the result, only 5% and 24% of cells reached G1 by 2 and 4 hours, even though by 8 hours most of pUL21a-expressing cells were able to enter G1, likely due to low expression of pUL21a in these cells as compared to those in transiently transfected cells. Additionally, following nocodazole withdrawal, APC substrates geminin and cyclin B1 remained elevated in the presence of tetracycline while their levels were reduced in its absence (Figure 5C). Our results provide strong evidence that pUL21a expression alone is sufficient to regulate APC activity.",

We first tested if the ability of pUL21a to regulate the APC would be responsible for its previously reported role in promoting viral DNA replication [30]. We compared the growth of ADpmUL21aPR-AA mutant virus (i.e. pUL21a APC-binding deficient) to that of wild-type, ADpmUL21aPH-AA (i.e. pUL21a APC-binding competent), or UL21a deletion viruses in multi-step growth curve analysis. We found that ADpmUL21aPR-AA grew indistinguishably from wild-type and ADpmUL21aPH-AA viruses in both cycling and G0-synchronized fibroblasts, whereas the UL21a deletion virus had a 100-fold defect (Figure 6A) [29]. Furthermore, knockdown of Cdh1 and APC8 was unable to enhance UL21a-deletion virus replication (data not shown). This suggests that pUL21a has at least two independent activities. One is to facilitate viral DNA replication via an unknown mechanism and is responsible for the growth defect of UL21a deletion virus. The second activity is to regulate the APC, whose impact on virus replication is not apparent under the aforementioned experimental conditions.",

            "text": "As two HCMV proteins, pUL97 and pUL21a, are capable of regulating the APC, we hypothesized that one of these two proteins acted to compensate for the loss of the other during infection. Consistent with this hypothesis, HCMV appeared to retain the ability, at least to some extent, to regulate the APC even when pUL21a or pUL97 is absent (Figure 4E, and data not shown) [24]. To test this hypothesis more directly, we created recombinant HCMV viruses ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL97 and ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL97. The two viruses were derived from ADpmUL21aPH-AA and ADpmUL21aPR-AA, respectively, and both contained an additional deletion in UL97. Both recombinant viruses grew slower than wild-type virus due to lack of the multifunctional pUL97 protein (Figure 6C). However, reconstitution of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL97 that lacked pUL21a APC-binding activity following BAC transfection was markedly slower than that of ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL97 (Figure 6B). At day 25 post transfection, while cells transfected with the BAC clone of ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL97 showed nearly 100% of CPE indicated by virus-driven GFP expression, GFP-positive foci in cells transfected with the BAC clone of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL97 were distinctly smaller. Furthermore, multi-step growth curve analysis showed that titers of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL97 were 13- and 14- fold lower than that of ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL97 at 14 and 21 days post infection (dpi), respectively (Figure 6C). As a control to show that this phenotype was not due to general viral attenuation resulting from the UL97 deletion, we also constructed double mutant viruses ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL117 and ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL117. These two viruses were derived similarly from ADpmUL21aPH-AA and ADpmUL21aPR-AA, but also contained a deletion in viral gene UL117. We chose UL117 as the control because its mutation attenuated virus growth but not viral early or early-late gene expression so UL97 expression was unlikely affected [34]. BAC transfection reconstituted both mutant viruses at similar efficiency and produced viruses with similar titers (data not shown). Multi-step growth analysis demonstrated that ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL117 and ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL117 replicated at similar kinetics (Figure 6D). At 14 dpi, the titer of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL117 was slightly lower (e.g. 1.5-fold) than that of ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL117. However, growth of mutant virus carrying only the UL117 deletion tracked with ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL117, suggesting that the difference between the PH and PR mutants at 14 dpi, if any, is minimal. Together, our data provide evidence that disruptions of both pUL97 and the APC regulatory activity of pUL21a are synthetically lethal to HCMV replication. This is consistent with a working model that these two functions enable HCMV to cope with APC activity to promote virus replication (Figure 7).",

            "text": "HCMV has been shown to have two different means to regulate the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) during infection [24], [27], [28]. It can induce phosphorylation of APC co-activator Cdh1, and it induces dissociation of the complex by promoting proteasomal degradation of two components of the bridge subcomplex, APC4 and APC5. The viral protein pUL97 appears to be responsible for Cdh1 phosphorylation [24]. However, pUL97 is an HCMV-encoded kinase that has many reported roles [26], [35]. How this particular pUL97 activity impacts HCMV infection remains elusive. Importantly, the viral factor or precise molecular mechanism mediating APC4 and APC5 degradation has not been identified, and how APC disruption contributes to HCMV replication is not known. Here, we have identified the HCMV protein pUL21a as the viral factor that mediates APC disruption. It does so by interacting with the APC and inducing proteasome-dependent degradation of APC4 and APC5, which results in complex dissociation. This is the first identified viral protein that modulates the APC in this manner. We also show, for the first time, the impact of viral modulation of the APC, particularly by pUL21a, on HCMV replication. Loss of pUL21a-mediated APC regulation has minimal impact on virus replication but the combined loss of both pUL97- and pUL21a-mediated regulation markedly attenuates growth of the virus relative to single loss of pUL21a- or pUL97- mediated regulation. Our studies support a working model in which HCMV uses pUL97-mediated Cdh1 phosphorylation and pUL21a-mediated complex disruption to control APC activity for efficient virus infection (Figure 7). Why has HCMV developed these two distinct mechanisms that seemingly lead to a similar biological consequence? It is possible that these two mechanisms have differential roles in HCMV infection under different conditions or in particular cell types, even though either one seems sufficient and can compensate for loss of the other in fibroblasts. Alternatively, it is possible that these two mechanisms serve as the fallback for one another or act synergistically to maximize the ability of the virus to acquire a complete control of the APC during infection. In any event, the fact that HCMV uses multiple means to subvert the APC underlines its critical role in HCMV infection. This is particularly true for large DNA viruses such as HCMV, which often encode multiple viral factors to regulate the same or related cellular targets central to their infection [36]. However, it is often challenging to dissect these intertwined viral mechanisms during infection because of the presence of other factors targeting the same process. The regulation of the APC represents one such critical but complex viral regulatory strategy, and our studies shed light into its role and mechanism during HCMV infection.",

The chicken anemia virus (CAV) protein apoptin can bind to the APC at the bridge and cause its dissociation using an unknown mechanism [19]. The fact that proteins from both HCMV and CAV target the APC bridge subcomplex suggests that viruses have evolved regulatory strategies converging on this sub-complex as an efficient means to disable APC activity. It is intriguing to speculate that modulating the APC complex by dissolving the bridge may allow viruses to alter substrate specificity of the APC instead of completely abolishing its activity, as the enzymatic portion of APC is known to have activity in vitro\n[23], [38]. HCMV does not appear to directly destroy the enzymatic subcomplex of APC, so it is of interest to determine if the APC retains some activity or is directed to target different substrates during virus infection.",

Deletion of the parapoxvirus PACR or CAV protein apoptin markedly attenuated virus growth in tissue culture even though their ability and role in inhibiting the APC during infection has not been clarified [23], [39]. Recently, the UL97 kinase of HCMV has been shown to phosphorylate Cdh1 and partially inhibit the APC during infection but with unknown consequences for viral replication [24]. Our study elucidates the mechanism by which pUL21a regulates APC in the context of virus infection and indicates a role of this pUL21a activity in viral replication. Mutation abolishing the APC binding activity of pUL21a had no impact on viral growth in tissue culture, but the loss of both pUL21a-APC binding and pUL97 markedly attenuated viral replication relative to the loss of pUL97 alone. Our data suggest that HCMV has evolved a sophisticated strategy by encoding both pUL97 and pUL21a to overcome APC activity. However, further experiments are needed to unequivocally demonstrate the vital role of APC regulation in HCMV replication and provide mechanistic insight into how this regulation impacts its biology.",

Currently, we also do not know which subunit of the APC complex that pUL21a directly binds to so the precise mechanism that it uses to degrade APC4 and APC5 remains elusive. It is certainly possible that pUL21a may bind to a subunit neighboring to APC4 and APC5 so it can disrupt the APC structure leading to APC4 and APC5 degradation, or recruit a protein degradation enzyme (e.g. E3 ubiquitin ligase) to destabilize the subunits. However, knockdown of APC8 does not abrogate the ability of pUL21a to degrade APC4 and APC5, suggesting that APC8 is not involved and the presence of the entire complex is not required. Intriguingly, pUL21a itself is a highly unstable protein and likely degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner [29], [40]. It is tempting to speculate that pUL21a may directly bind APC4 and APC5 and target them for degradation in a ubiquitin-independent manner. One focus of future work is to identify the APC component that pUL21a directly binds to and elucidate the mechanism of how pUL21a targets APC4 and APC5 to the proteasome.",

            "text": "What would be the benefit for the virus to alter APC activity? The APC may restrict HCMV replication via several mechanisms. The APC not only promotes cell cycle progression through M phase, it also prevents cells from prematurely entering S phase. Thus virus-mediated APC regulation may help HCMV maintain an S phase-like cellular environment for viral replication. The APC targets more than 40 proteins for degradation, so it may deplete host factors critical to viral replication. Consequently, viruses may need to alter the substrate specificity of the APC or allow accumulation of APC substrates critical for viral replication. Interestingly, the only viruses within the poxvirus and herpesvirus families that are known to modulate the APC (e.g. parapoxviruses and HCMV) are those that do not encode viral thymidine kinase (TK) and ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2). Both enzymes are APC substrates and critical for the production of deoxyribonucleotides. It is tempting to speculate that this viral regulation of the APC may provide viruses a means to produce sufficient nucleotides to replicate their genome [23], [27]. Nonetheless, the APC also targets proteins involved in cellular DNA synthesis, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, and cell cycle progression, all of which could impact viral replication [41]. Moreover, the APC may also promote ubiquitination and degradation of viral proteins to restrict infection [42]. Several HCMV proteins contain a putative destruction Box (D-box) motif, an APC recognition signal commonly found in its substrates [24]. Future work is needed to differentiate these possibilities and unravel the APC substrates that may be critical for viral replication.",

Due to its essential role in cell cycle progression, the APC is a promising target for novel anti-cancer therapeutics [16], [43]. In fact, we found in this study that overexpression of pUL21a essentially prevented the proliferation of a transformed cell line (Figure S7), suggesting that pUL21a regulation of the APC could inhibit cancer cell growth. Furthermore, several recent studies have also highlighted a vital role of the APC in neuronal development (for a review, see [44]). HCMV infects neuronal cells and congenital HCMV infection leads to neuronal disease and severe complications such as blindness, hearing loss, and mental retardation. It is reasonable to speculate that inhibition of the APC by pUL21a may play a role in promoting neuronal disease in congenitally infected infants. Therefore, an understanding of pUL21a-APC interaction may reveal novel mechanisms of APC assembly and regulation, give further impetus to target the APC for anti-cancer therapies, and uncover new insights into the molecular basis of HCMV pathogenesis.",
