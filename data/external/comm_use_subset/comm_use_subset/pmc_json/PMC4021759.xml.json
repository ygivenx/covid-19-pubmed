Engagement of non-ASEAN stakeholders is also vital considering that infectious diseases and NTDs are emerging in European countries and other Western states. In Europe, a surprisingly high incidence of NTDs was recorded among more than 150 million Europeans, especially those living below the poverty line [16,17].",

This is consistent with the GSPA-PHI goal of making a network of networks wherein the ASEAN-NDI can partner up with other NDIs (ANDI, China-NDI, India-NDI, etc.) that have been established and form the nucleus for South-South collaboration [6]. With a number of NTDs and vector-borne diseases which affect both the African and Asian regions [20-22], network collaboration will be helpful in developing and conducting R&D projects which result in programs and policies which address such public health threats.
