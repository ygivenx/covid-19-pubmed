While PrimerExplorer is very useful for LAMP signature design, as demonstrated by its widespread use, it has several limitations that reduced its usability for our high-throughput whole-genome analysis. First, PrimerExplorer doesn't support IUPAC characters other than \"ATCG\" in the input sequence, which are often used in MSA representations, because it was not built to handle MSA representations. Second, PrimerExplorer only runs in Windows operating systems, in a specific web browser. Third, PrimerExplorer cannot design signatures with loop primers, as discussed in Nagamine et al. [4] in a single execution, instead requiring two serial executions, which can prevent more optimal primer combinations from being identified. And fourth, PrimerExplorer is less suited for high throughput analysis since it is limited to a single execution process on a computer, accepts only up to 2,000 bp sequences, and outputs only HTML.",

For combinations of primers, the penalty also includes factors for for inter-primer spacing. The assessment of the primer by the PrimerAnalyzer is returned as PrimerInfo objects, which are used to provide primer sequence information for signature output. This may appear redundant because the primers already contain the original sequence information, but since different scores can exist for the same primer in different roles, and some analysis methods may impose context-sensitive sequence restrictions as part of score calculation, relying on PrimerInfo guarantees that the correct sequence is associated with the analysis result for each context.",

Primer3 output can also be limited by explicitly setting a maximum number of primers for Primer3 to generate. The second option is to set stricter primer overlap limits. Stringent overlap limits may make it possible to perform the comprehensive dimerization checks discussed above within reasonable processing times.",

In general, calculations based on a \"TTTT\" linker sequence predict a slight increase in sensitivity in many of the likely hybridization configurations, because of a slightly longer and more stable base pairing at the 5' end of the hybridization. However, in one instance, this linker greatly increased predicted primer self-hybridization because of an unfortunate co-incidence of self-similar sequence. The chance of this being a problem increases if the number of consecutive identical bases in the designed primers cannot be limited. Improper choice of linker sequence can also increase predicted primer dimerization. A more context-aware linker design should yield better results than always using a single linker sequence. One day, we hope LAVA will suggest the most appropriate linker sequence, or omission of the linker, for each designed signature, to help support desired assay behavior. One potential approach is to design linkers that are the least complimentary to the loop regions adjacent to the F1 region in the LAMP dumbbell structures as possible. Another potential approach is to design linker-free primers like Poon et al [11], which is currently the default behavior of LAVA.",

The fundamental difference in approach for designing primers with degeneracy, is that primers are enumerated based on all the sequences of the MSA, instead of based on only the first sequence. Our proof of concept requires different internal representations of sub-sequence MSAs, but is built using the existing OligoEnumerator and PrimerAnalyzer interfaces.",
