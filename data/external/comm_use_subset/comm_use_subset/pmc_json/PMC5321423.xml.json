Outbreaks of adenovirus infection had been reported worldwide and are recognized as the leading cause of febrile illness and respiratory diseases [2]. Based on serology, genome sequencing, and biological characteristics, HAdVs have been classified into seven species (HAdV-A to G), which include more than 64 serotypes [3]. Different genotypes have been associated with distinct clinical symptoms. For instance, respiratory diseases have been linked mostly to HAdV-B serotypes 3, 7, and 14, and HAdV-C serotypes 1, 2, 5, and 6 [4, 5]. Among these serotypes, HAdV-7 is frequently associated with severe respiratory disease [6]. Numerous reports have covered the consequences of HAdV-7-induced epidemics among children and in crowded spaces. These include febrile pharyngitis and pneumonia accompanied by acute respiratory disease, some of which have been associated with fatal outcomes [7].",

With the application of whole genome sequencing, two HAdV-7 strains identified in separate ARD outbreaks contained a 12-bp deletion in the VA RNA II gene, even though hexon, fibre, and other genes were highly conserved [12]. Nevertheless, there is no clear evidence whether the VA RNA II gene mutations contributed to past HAdV-7 outbreaks.",

The hexon, fibre, and VA RNA I genes clustered quite intensely within serotype 7 in the phylogenetic trees, suggesting the conserved prevalence of HAdV-7 in China in recent years.

Interestingly, the HAdV VA RNA genes are located right in front of the L1 52/55K gene [26], which plays an important role in forming mature, infectious virions [27, 28]. In fact, we show that the start codon of L1 52/55K mRNA is located only two nucleotides after the terminal region of VA RNA II (Fig 2). We first tried to measure the expression ratio between the VA RNA II and L1 52/55K gene of different HAdV-7 strains. However, given the possibility that the mutation in the VA RNA II gene might alter the expression of the gene itself, we chose instead to assess the expression of L1 52/55K against that of E1A. Being the first expressed early gene [29], E1A could reflect the expression of HAdV genes and avoid being influenced by late genes. We show that L1 52/55K mRNA was up-regulated compared with strains CDC228 and XY1, confirming the possibility that deletion in the terminator of VAII could exert an effect on this adjacent gene. The terminal region of VA RNAs is characterized by a cluster of T surrounded by a GC-rich stretch [30]. This region is transcribed by RNA polymerase III [31], which is prone to misreading the termination sequence and read through the next genes [30]. Accordingly, the loss of T in the terminator might destabilize the secondary structure of the terminal stem and increase the chance of continued transcription of L1 52/55K by RNA polymerase III. Considering the role of L1 52/55K protein in promoting the formation of infectious virions, the up-regulation of L1 52/55K might explain the rapid growth of the Wuhan strain and this outbreak. In addition, a previous report suggested that the L1 52/55K gene, which recombined from HAdV-B16, was a reason for the virulence of HAdV-7 strains predominated in China [32]. The WH strain identified in this outbreak shared 100% identity with this reported L1 52/55K gene. Thus, the up-regulated expression of this L1 52/55K gene could lead to increased virulence of WH strain.",

The latter promoted faster growth of the HAdV-7 strain, thus providing a causal link between the VA RNA II gene and a severe clinical outcome. Taking into account the phylogenetic results on the conserved nature of HAdV-7 hexon and fibre genes in China in recent years, VA RNA genes represent a new determinant factor for HAdV-7 virulence upon infection. However, further work, such as functional verification of the missing T bases by constructing a deletion mutant of strain CDC228 or reverse mutant of the WH strain, should be done to elucidate the function of the VA RNA II gene and its relationship to the increased growth capacity of the HAdV-7 strain.",
