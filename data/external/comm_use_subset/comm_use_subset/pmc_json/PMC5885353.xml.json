Enteric diseases in newborn piglets are often endemic, but may also occur as outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality [2, 3]. Although the latter ones have a major economic impact in the short-term, the economic consequences of endemic and recurrent neonatal diarrhoea can also be substantial. In studies conducted in Sweden and Denmark, diarrhoea was estimated to account for 5\u201324% of the overall pre-weaning mortality [4] and for a reduction in average daily gain (ADG) by 8\u201314 g/day in the first week of life [5, 6]. Based on these production losses, the cost of neonatal diarrhoea was recently estimated to be 134 \u20ac per sow per year in affected herds [7].",

Therefore, acute diarrhoea in the newborn pig should always receive immediate attention [10].",

RVA is often detected as the sole infectious agent, but the majority of studies are based on qualitative detection of RVA without histologic verification; this fact implies that the causative significance of this virus is often unknown. Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus (TGEV) and Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus (PEDV) can also cause diarrhoea in piglets [15]. TGEV is a cause of disease in most pig-producing areas of the world [16], but the clinical impact of TGEV in Europe is low since 1980s\u201390s due to the extensive spread of the closely related Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PCRV), which resulted in immunological cross-protection [16]. PEDV was recognized for the first time in Europe during the seventies, but a major concern re-appeared in the European swine production in 2014 when the virus was detected in several countries causing high piglet mortality and significant economic losses [17]. Outbreaks of PED in suckling piglets are clinically indistinguishable from outbreaks of TGE [18].",

Escherichia coli is probably the most important one, responsible for a range of different diseases in both man and animals [19]. The main pathotype of E. coli responsible for intestinal disease in pigs is enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) [20]. However, there are other E. coli pathotypes also linked with piglet disease, such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and those known as attaching-and-effacing (A/E) E. coli [21]. Clostridium perfringens is another important diarrhoeagenic pathogen, which is classified into five groups (A to E) based on the production of the major toxin types alpha, beta, epsilon and iota [22]. C. perfringens type C produces \u03b1- and \u03b2-toxin and can cause high mortality rates in newborns [23]. C. perfringens type A produces \u03b1-toxin and \u00df2-toxin; besides being considered a cause of neonatal diarrhoea, it is also considered part of the normal intestinal microbiota of piglets [24].",

Major determinants for the manifestation of neonatal diarrhoea include factors such as passive immunity transferred by colostrum and milk [30], environmental temperature [31] and humidity [21], management [32] and infection pressure by specific pathogens of the herd [32]. The present study focused on different enteric pathogens able to cause neonatal diarrhoea in piglets in an important European pig producing country such as Spain, with specific focus on frequency of infections and co-infections.

In consequence, it was not possible to assess in which number of submissions the primary cause was a pathogen. Noteworthy, infectious diarrhoea in newborn piglets is usually related to the presence of a single pathogen and mixed infections are considered less common [33].

Rotavirus is among the most prevalent pathogens in cases of neonatal diarrhoea, and is often detected as the sole infectious agent [34]. In fact, several recent studies have described such high prevalence in pigs in Europe and North America [13; 14]. In contrast, only 4 submissions were positive to PEDV. After the 1980s, problems with PEDV in Europe declined and disease outbreaks have been occasionally seen during the last decades [17]. In 2013, PEDV was introduced for the first time on the American continent and resulted in severe outbreaks of disease in the na\u00efve population [17]. Recently, PEDV isolates similar to the S-INDEL variants described in America have also been detected in Europe [35, 36]. Regarding the occurrence of PED in 2014\u20132015 recorded by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Network, countries voluntarily reported 245 cases of pig herds meeting the PED case definition and 71 pig herds with RT-PCR confirmation of PEDV-genome; such PEDV-confirmed cases were found in Austria, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany (EFSA, 2015). As expected, TGEV was not found in any of the submissions. TGEV is a cause of disease in most pig-producing areas of the world [16]. However, outbreaks of TGE in Europe are rare, probably due to immunological cross-protection induced by PRCV, which is apparently ubiquitous in the continent [16].",

Pathogenic pathotypes of E. coli were found only in 10% of the submissions in the present study which may reflect such a decrease in prevalence. Anyway, it is known that the major pathotype of E. coli responsible for intestinal disease in pigs is ETEC [20] and these data fit with the results of the current work, since 9 out of 11 E. coli pathotypes were ETEC (with major virulence factors being STII and STI toxins and F4 fimbriae). Curiously, two of the E. coli isolates consisted of EPEC strains, which are usually related with post-weaning diarrhoea [21]. However, EPEC isolates from neonatal diarrhoea have been already described [38, 39]. In contrast, all tested submissions yielded non-pathogenic E. coli strains, which is in line with other published works. In a Danish study on neonatal diarrhoea in four commercial swine herds, non-haemolytic E. coli were the most predominant isolate obtained after aerobic culturing of both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets [40]. This was also the case in a similar Swedish study on neonatal diarrhoea, where non-haemolytic E. coli was found in all piglets [41]. The prevalence of classical porcine ETEC in both Scandinavian studies was very low in diarrhoeic piglets (less than 3%). This fact can be associated to modern swine production, in which pre-farrowing vaccination of sows against E. coli fimbriae antigens (F4, F5 and F6) is common.",

            "text": "C. perfringens type A was found in most of the submissions (89.9%), with detection of the cpb2 gene by PCR in the majority of cases. Moreover, in 88 cases such results were reinforced with the production in vitro of the \u03b22 toxin by immunoblotting. This result fits well with a recent report from Poland [42], who found a 91.4% prevalence of C. perfringens type A at herd level. Such a high rate of detection raises the question of this bacterium as a true cause of diarrhoea or part of the microbiota, which may be up-regulated in enteric disease scenarios. In fact, the impact of \u03b1 and \u03b22 toxins on disease pathogenesis has not been conclusively answered [43]. In contrast, C. perfringens type C was not detected in any of the samples. This bacterium causes disease in piglets in many areas of the world, but in a global perspective, it is considered much less important than other enteric pathogens [22]. In the same Polish survey, for example, they found a 1.4% herd prevalence of this bacterium [42]. Probably, during recent years, C. perfringens type C infections are rare in cases of neonatal diarrhoea due to sow vaccination [34]. Indeed, in Spain, routine vaccination of sows pre-farrowing with beta toxoid vaccines is usual.",
