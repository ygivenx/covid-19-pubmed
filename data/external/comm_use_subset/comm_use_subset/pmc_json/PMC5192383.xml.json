Zika virus was first isolated from a sentinel monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947 [1]. Since then, ZIKV has been isolated from humans and mosquitoes throughout Africa and Southeast Asian countries. Phylogenetic analysis of the nonstructural protein 5 encoding region has disclosed three ZIKV lineages: East African, West African, and Asian [2]. Sequences from Uganda and Senegal belong to the East African cluster, while sequences from Nigeria and also some sequences from Senegal are clustered on the West African lineage [3]. Most of the viral sequences recovered from recent outbreaks, from 2007 until now, belong to the Asian lineage, such as strains isolated in American, South Asian, and Pacific countries. In utero exposure to Asian lineage ZIKV might lead to microcephaly and other developmental malformations including calcifications, arthrogryposis, ventriculomegaly, lissencephaly, cerebellar atrophy, and ocular abnormalities [4,5,6,7,8]. Although all ZIKV lineages can infect humans, these severe manifestations reported after in utero infection have only been associated with Asian lineages, including Brazilian isolates [6,9]. ",

Mild symptoms such as headache and low-grade fever were reported by a human volunteer during infection with the African ZIKV strain [13]. However, in rare instances, infection with the Asian ZIKV is associated with cases of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome [14] and meningoencephalitis [15]. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat ZIKV infections. With the alarming increase in the number of countries affected and the potential for viral spread through global travel and sexual transmission [16,17], there is an urgent need to find a treatment capable of lessening the effects of the disease and inhibiting further transmission.",

These cells were cultured in DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 20% FBS. The C6/36 cell line is derived from Aedes albopictus. C6/36 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in Leibovitz L-15 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 2.95 g/L tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma Aldrich, Boston, MA, USA), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (GIBCO), 1X non-essential amino acids (GIBCO) and 5% FBS.

Briefly, the medium was changed every other day until day 7, when initial NSCs are split and grown on neural expansion medium (Advanced DMEM/F12 and neurobasal medium (1:1) with neural induction supplement; GIBCO). NSCs were used after four passages in neural expansion media. Mouse central nervous system (CNS) cells were harvested from Swiss mouse embryos at embryo day 14 (E14) and grown for 72 h as free floating neurospheres in neurobasal culture media (GIBCO) supplemented with 1X B27 (GIBCO).",

Viral infectivity was assessed using the 4G2 antibody, which detects flavivirus envelope E protein. We observed that chloroquine treatment decreased the number of ZIKV-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed a reduction of 35% and 65% in ZIKV-infected cells when cultures were treated with 25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM chloroquine, respectively, compared to untreated infected cells (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence staining corroborated these results (Figure 1B) and additionally, chloroquine decreased the production of infectious (Figure 1C) and total (Figure 1D) virus particles, including defective viral particles, by ZIKV-infected cells. To confirm that viral inhibition is independent of chloroquine cytotoxicity, the viability of uninfected cells treated with chloroquine (1.56 to 200 \u03bcM) for 5 days was analyzed. Chloroquine did not impact cell viability at concentrations of 50 \u03bcM or lower (Figure 1E). We further analyzed whether chloroquine treatment could protect Vero cells from ZIKV infection as assessed by cell viability. Chloroquine, ranging from 12.5 to 50 \u03bcM, increased cell viability from 55% up to 100% (Figure 1F).",

To evaluate which step of the viral cycle was susceptible to inhibition, chloroquine was added to Vero cells at different time points post-infection with ZIKV MR766. The supernatant was collected 30 h post-infection and virus production was evaluated by relative quantification of viral RNA over the untreated control by RT-qPCR. Virus titers were also determined by plaque assay in Vero cells. Incubation of Vero cells with chloroquine at 0 h post-infection had a greater impact on the production of ZIKV particles, decreasing viral RNA 64-fold over the controls (Figure 3A). The addition of chloroquine from 30 min to 12 h post-infection was able to reduce virus release 9\u201320 fold over untreated, infected-cells. However, chloroquine added at 24 h post-infection had only a minor effect on viral production (Figure 3A). These results were confirmed by quantification of ZIKV infectious particles released after chloroquine treatment (Figure 3B).

            "text": "Although chloroquine has shown antiviral activity against a large spectrum of viruses in vitro, few clinical studies have been performed to evaluate chloroquine effects on patients with viral infections. Two clinical trial studies of chloroquine have been conducted to assess chloroquine treatment in patients infected with DENV [37,38]. One of the trials evaluated the benefits of chloroquine treatment for 3 days in patients infected with DENV and showed no reduction in the duration or intensity of DENV viremia or nonstructural 1 protein (NS1) antigenemia clearance [37]. However, a trend towards a reduction in the number of dengue hemorrhagic fever cases was noticed in the chloroquine-treated group [37]. A more recent clinical trial of chloroquine administration to DENV-infected patients, also for 3 days, showed that 60% of the patients in the chloroquine-treated group reported feeling less pain and showed improvement in the performance of daily chores during treatment [38]. Moreover, the symptoms returned after medication withdrawal. However, chloroquine treatment did not reduce the duration and intensity of the fever or duration of the disease [38]. The antiviral effect of chloroquine may be insufficient to produce a decrease in viral load or improvement of the disease progression when chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine is used in monotherapy. However, chloroquine may produce a significant antiflaviviral effect when used in combination therapies, as recently shown in a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine plus ribavirin and interferon alpha in individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [39]. In regard to the potential antiviral therapeutic combinations for Zika, a freshly published screening of drugs already approved for other clinical indications has resulted in the identification of more than 20 candidate drugs [40]. Of note, one of these is mefloquine, a compound related to chloroquine. In terms of safety for pregnant women, however, mefloquine is included in the B category, i.e., a drug for which the animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Be that as it may, the aforementioned study corroborates our results using chloroquine, and provides new anti-ZIKV drugs that could be tested in combination with chloroquine.",

Chloroquine inhibits acidification of the endosome, consequently inhibiting the low pH-induced conformational changes required for the fusion of the envelope protein of flaviviruses with the endosomal membrane [52]. Chloroquine was also effective in decreasing virus release, although less pronouncedly and not statistically significant, when added after the early stages of virus infection (from 0.5 to 24 h post-infection), suggesting that later stages of the ZIKV replication cycle might also be affected (Figure 3).

Using the mouse neurospheres model to study neural stem cell differentiation into neurons, another process that might be disturbed in microcephaly, we observed that chloroquine inhibited the infection of neuronal progenitors and partially protected the ability of these cells to extend neurites (Figure 6). The protective effect of chloroquine on stem cells and committed progenitors is potentially a groundbreaking feature of this compound, as it would be prescribed to women at childbearing age that are traveling to affected countries and women planning pregnancy in endemic areas.
