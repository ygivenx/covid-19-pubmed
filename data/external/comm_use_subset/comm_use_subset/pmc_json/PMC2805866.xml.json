            "text": "The late 1990s heralded the development of several important technological advances in molecular biological research. DNA microarray and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) were introduced allowing comparisons of global gene expression utilizing differing conditions in laboratory experimentation. This has allowed the relatively new field of comparative genomics to flourish (43, 54). With respect to the brain, patterns of gene expression have been reported as early as 1999 with comparative libraries generated between malignant glioma tissue and normal brain for SAGE, and between sleep\u2013wake cycles for microarray (40, 55). From this point there has been an explosion of genomic information with steadily increasing reports generated during development and aging (38, 94, 106), malignant brain processes (37, 101), neurodegenerative disorders (41, 58), behavioral (12, 45) and anatomical studies (18). Studies into epileptogenesis have also expanded since the first global gene expression studies into epilepsy in 2001 (29, 42). For this reason we will review the published papers and discuss the usefulness of global transcriptome analyses with regards to epileptogenesis.",

It includes seizures occurring in the absence of a recognized cause as well as events occurring in patients with antecedent stable (non-progressing) central nervous system insults (unprovoked seizures), but excludes seizures occurring in a close temporal relationship with an acute systemic, toxic or metabolic insult, which is expected to be the underlying cause (provoked seizures) (28).",

            "text": "Within the broad classification of epilepsy, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common location-related epilepsy. This may be lesional or non-lesional, with the great majority of non-lesional MTLE being associated pathologically with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). There remains much debate in the neurological world regarding HS as a cause or consequence of seizures. Pathological evidence has shown the presence of HS in brains of dementia patients without clinical epilepsy (19, 104). In addition, MTLE patients with dual pathology may have HS that is: (i) a non-specific result of the primary epileptogenic lesion and not in itself epileptogenic; (ii) secondary to the primary epileptogenic lesions but also epileptogenic; or (iii) a primary HS that coexists with another epileptogenic lesions (109). Proponents of the initiating hit theory of epilepsy argue that the progressive nature of MTLE demonstrates HS as a consequence of the seizure process. Typically a variable latent period between the initial precipitating incident and habitual unprovoked seizures is present, followed by a silent period between the first habitual unprovoked seizure and the onset of intractability. This strongly suggests that the pathology is progressive (5). Worsening HS creates a cycle whereby increased seizure severity and frequency lead to further neuropathological changes and hence worsening clinical seizures. Several theories for the cause of HS have been proposed, with the most commonly quoted being febrile convulsions. Other theories include vascular injuries and developmental abnormalities. It is this process of progression to seizures of worsening severity with increasing frequency that is termed epileptogenesis (Figure 1).",

It is a pathological diagnosis although advances in neuroimaging through magnetic resonance imaging had allowed the use of radiology as a supporting or diagnostic tool. The pathological diagnosis consists of atrophy of the hippocampal formation with loss of neurones and reactive gliosis in CA1, CA4 and the dentate gyrus. In CA4, there is a loss of polymorphic neurons and pyramidal neurons. CA3 shows some neuronal loss, but CA1 always shows significant neuronal loss that may be very severe. There is a variable degree of gliosis seen in these subregions and occasional vessel sclerosis has been described. Loss of granule cells in the dentate gyrus is variable, as is gliosis. Granule cell distribution is often disrupted and various patterns including dual lamination or dispersion are described. Sprouting of the mossy fiber system in the dentate gyrus is apparent with Timm's stain with many believing that this sprouting leads to aberrant reinnervation resulting in the hyperirritable lesion that constitutes the epileptogenic hippocampus. Within all these changes, CA2 is relatively spared (68) (Figure 2).",

A high amount of starting mRNA is required that is often prohibitive and not feasible, especially in difficult to obtain human specimens or complex experimental procedures. In addition, the cost of SAGE is high and may preclude repeat experimentation to verify collected data. Although SAGE studies the entire genome, the use of a four-base pair anchoring enzyme relies on the fact that the majority of mRNA sequences contain an anchoring site on average every 256 base pair stretch (44 = 256). The reality is a small proportion of mRNA will not include this anchoring site, leading to a loss of some small fraction of mRNA from the analysis that is extremely difficult to quantify. Clearly the use of a 10-base pair sequence to map gene assignment may cause issues in terms of specificity and sensitivity. It is not uncommon for multiple genes to share the same tag or for a single gene to be mapped by multiple tags.",

It becomes a useful model of chronic epileptogenesis with the appearance of spontaneous seizures at a time point distant to the initial convulsive event. This model demonstrates the classical progression of human temporal lobe epilepsy with an initial convulsive event leading to seizures and status epilepticus before a latency period of varying length and appearance spontaneous seizures following this. Advocates of this model point to the presence of a latency period as the period of opportunity, whereby interruption of the epileptogenic process during this time may bring about a stop in the progression of spontaneous seizures. The difficulty lies in measuring the duration of each animal's individual latency period and hence the optimal time point for intervention and study. The duration of latency is known to be related to the convulsant dose with higher doses yielding shorter onset latencies (39). Current figures suggest a mean onset latency of around 40 days; however, shorter periods have been described (32). As such, estimates of latency periods used in research studies vary from 8 to 50 days.",

With repeated application of the electrical stimulus once or twice a day for only seconds at a time, electrical afterdischarges were observed to appear and gradually lengthen, and recordable after-discharges were observed to broaden in origin from adjacent brain regions to more distant regions and eventually the opposite hemisphere. In addition to this electrical progression, a behavioral progression of seizure activity occurred commencing with focal seizure activity typically manifested as initial facial clonus contralateral to the side of stimulation after a short delay. Progression through a stepwise series of more overt and eventually generalized seizures follows. This behavioral progression has been assigned a grading system, from grade 1 to 5 by Racine (81) in his study of amygdala kindling in rats. An animal may be regarded as fully kindled after manifesting a number of grade 5 seizures.",

Stimulation paradigms are also spaced over minutes to days and may take months to reach the fully kindled state. The ideal animal model for human temporal lobe epilepsy would consist of similar pathology, a latent period after the initial insult appropriate for the species, a state of chronic hyperexcitability and the emergence of spontaneous seizures after a latent period (107). The absence of a true latent period in electrical kindling is in opposition to this. Latency is seen from the first kindling stimulation to the eventual appearance of seizures; however, additional insults in the form of further electrical stimuli are being provided leading up to and merging with the evoked seizures. Electrical kindling also does not produce spontaneous seizures, unless prolonged kindling is performed. This is coined the \u201cover-kindling\u201d model (79). In this model continued electrical stimulation is given beyond the standard stage-5 criterion of the fully kindled state. The number of additional stimulations is extremely variable with recent reports suggesting at least an additional 90 to 100 kindled seizures required in rats for recurrent spontaneous seizures to occur (71, 87).",

This suggests a multifactorial mechanism of injury for kainic acid induced seizures that mimics or utilizes the same pathways as those associated with ischaemia, hypoglycemia or hemorrhage (95). Whether seizures themselves primarily induce these genomic changes or secondarily act through periods of ischemic or hypoglycemic during seizure episodes remain unclear. What is clear, however, is the similarities in histological changes seen in these conditions with marked neuronal loss, fibrillary gliosis with vacuolation and enlarged reactive astrocytes variously reported following severe hypoglycemia and ischemia, with or without associated status epilepticus (1, 13, 51, 52).",

Identification of highly represented functional classification as well as individual genes that appeared across data sets was performed with cell death and survival, neuronal plasticity and immune response as the most prominent. Seventy individual genes were identified to be consistently regulated across at least three studies using specific time-point analyses (64, 65). Our data indicates only 22 genes consistently regulated across at least three studies. This difference is explained by the inclusion of animal models of traumatic head injuries in the analysis by Lukasiuk et al that we did not include. The justification for their inclusion is the initial hit theory whereby an early insult, be it ischemic, traumatic or infective, sets into motion a series of molecular changes that lead into the latency period before chronic epilepsy. However, recent figures suggest only 2% to 5% of traumatic brain injury cases will develop epilepsy (75). Second, post-traumatic seizures are more commonly a result of cerebral contusions leading to scarring and altered neuronal circuitry rather than the classical MTLE syndrome. Filtering out the head injury papers from Lukasiuk et al's study leaves only four consistently regulated genes, three of which are included in our list of regulated genes (Gadd45a, Ctsd, Ctss, Zfp36). The last gene, zinc finger protein 36 (zfp36) is only reported differentially expressed in different arms of the same study by Becker et al and was excluded from our analysis.",

The use of stereo dissection or laser microdissection to accurately isolate different hippocampal subregions as performed by Becker et al, Datson et al and Torres-Munoz et al have challenged these notions. This technique has been described to allow direct microscopic identification of specific cell types without appreciable loss of their DNA or RNA. Furthermore microarray analysis was able to be performed on the limited amount of mRNA extracted using double round amplification to provide sufficient material (4, 17, 99). Marked differences (>700 genes) were found in the hippocampal response to chronic glucocorticoid exposure between CA3 and the dentate gyrus; however, 79 genes reliably identified in individual subfields were virtually undetectable when looking at whole hippocampal specimens.

It is well documented that SAGE may inconsistently detect low abundance transcripts leaving small genomic expression changes induced by the experimental model or disease undetected. This is evident in examining the epilepsy studies discussed above with each generated database containing 5000 to 14 000 unique tags only, a significant decrease from the estimated size of the entire hippocampal transcriptome being over 30 000 (16, 26). Furthermore, the sequencing error of SAGE is estimated at an average of 1% per base because of the fact they utilize a single-pass sequence in data processing. This accumulates to roughly 10% per 100 base pairs, leading to lower correct tags counts and artificially inflate the tag counts of already established tags or establish a count of a tag that does not exist. Microarray studies have also been shown to demonstrate significant variations even under the same experimental conditions. As such, validation of global expression profiling results by independent methods, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Northern/Western blotting and immunohistochemical methods, is crucial. In our experience, a significant decrease in the number of differentially expressed genes is demonstrated when validating SAGE results using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with a custom-made, low-density array chip of 94 significant genes as indicated by SAGE (82).",

It demonstrates specific genomic changes operating in concert with the entire molecular environment, thereby opening the doors to further research into possible causative pathways and functions through gene ontology annotations of cellular components, biological processes and molecular functions. In addition, the availability of large-scale libraries produced using uniform protocols allows the comparisons of commonality genes within other disorders apart from epilepsy potentially identifying reactive general genomic changes, shared pathways of action or specific causative genes. There is also the potential for discovery of novel genes not previously described with SAGE resulting in new hypotheses and theories into the pathogenesis of epilepsy as well as the potential to guide new therapeutic treatments in epilepsy as well as other disorders, neural or non-neural.",

Focusing genomic profiles into specific anatomical regions may enable causative molecular pathways to be identified and allow greater understanding of the histological changes, particular in the situation of HS associated MTLE whereby disagreement remains over the cause or effect of the pathological changes.",
