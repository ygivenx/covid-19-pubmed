Specifically, SGLT1 mediates the Na+/glucose cotransport function of the kidney and intestine as a secondary active transporter, while GLUT2 serves as a facilitated diffusion system for transport through lipid bilayers [4\u20136]. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was previously reported to transiently increase glucose transport [7, 8]. Moreover, a recently study suggested that EGFR may act as another receptor for TGEV, in addition to porcine aminopeptidase (pAPN) [9]. EGFR-dependent regulation of glucose uptake has been observed in tumor cells, and EGFR has been shown to prevent autophagic cell death by maintaining intracellular glucose levels through interaction with and stabilization of SGLT1 [10]. However, the involvement of EGFR in virus-induced effects on glucose uptake has yet to be evaluated.",

The remainder of each sample was then used to determine protein expression levels of glucose transporters. The radioactivity counts of each sample were normalized with respect to the protein and corrected for time uptake per milligram of protein. All uptake measurements were carried out in triplicate.

EGFR kinase activity regulates the peak glucose uptake and total EGFR may likely be maintaining basal glucose uptake [7, 8]. Therefore, we first examined whether EGFR expression was stimulated by TGEV infection. Western blot analysis showed that TGEV infection not only increased total EGFR expression (Fig 2A) but also revealed that more phosphorylated EGFR was present in TGEV infected relative to control cells (Fig 2B). Taken together, these results indicated that TGEV infection increased the total and phosphorylation protein expression of EGFR at 48 hpi. Together, these results indicate that TGEV infection promoted the total and phosphorylation protein expression of EGFR at 48 hpi.",

As shown in Fig 3A\u20133C, treatment with the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 suppressed glucose uptake and markedly decreased EGFR and p-EGFR protein expression, indicating that AG1478 regulated glucose uptake in mocked-infected cells. Furthermore, cells treated with AG1478 exhibited markedly lower levels of SGLT1 protein expression than the control cells; in contrast, there was no effect on GLUT2 protein expression.

Conversely, pLVX-EGFR transfection resulted in significantly increased EGFR and p-EGFR protein expression and glucose uptake. These data demonstrate that modulation of EGFR and p-EGFR expression affects glucose uptake in the absence of TGEV infection. Furthermore, transfection with shEGFR and pLVX-EGFR resulted in decreased and increased SGLT1 protein expression, respectively; in contrast, GLUT2 protein expression was unaffected by either treatment.

As shown in Fig 3H and 3J\u20133L, IPEC-J2 cells transfected with three SGLT1-specific shRNAs for 48 h exhibited reduced SGLT1 expression and reduced EGFR protein expression. Furthermore, we choose phlorizin as SGLT1 inhibitor because phlorizin's principal pharmacological action is to block intestinal glucose absorption through inhibition of the sodium\u2013glucose symporters located inmucosa of the small intestine [19, 20]. IPEC-J2 cells treated with phlorizin for 48 h showed downregulation of SGLT1 expression without inducing cell death, as demonstrated by CCK8 assay analyses (data not shown). Similarly, western blot analysis showed that IPEC-J2 cells treated with phlorizin exhibited lower EGFR expression than DMSO-treated cells. In conclusion, inhibition of SGLT1 by shRNA or phlorizin treatment disrupted EGFR expression. Notably, these treatments also resulted in decreased glucose uptake (Fig 3G and 3J). Consistent with these findings, IPEC-J2 cells transfected with shEGFR or treated with AG1478 also exhibited lower SGLT1 expression (Fig 3B and 3E).

Consistent with this conclusion, we found that TGEV enhanced glucose uptake in IPEC-J2 cells. Because glucose is the main energy source for cellular metabolism, TGEV replication in IPEC-J2 cells requires large amounts of glucose/energy. Thus, we explored whether high glucose uptake in TGEV-infected cells affected TGEV replication. TGEV contains a 27.6\u201331.3-kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome; the virion RNA functions as an mRNA and is infectious. The N protein, in particular, is a critical component of the replication-transcription complex [24\u201326]. Thus, we treated TGEV-infected cells with medium containing 0.1, 1, 10, or 25 mM glucose and harvested the virus at 48 hpi. As shown in Fig 5A, glucose absorption concentrations were 0.1, 1, 1.8, and 5.2 mM for medium containing 0.1, 1, 10, and 25 mM glucose, respectively. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that TGEV N protein was more abundant when TGEV-infected cells absorbed more glucose, particularly in medium containing 10 or 25 mM glucose (Fig 5B). Consistent with this finding, there was a concurrent increase in the copy number of the TGEV N gene as glucose absorption levels increased (Fig 5C). As described above, in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, higher glucose concentrations promoted TGEV replication. To exclude the possibility that cell viability and proliferation affect TGEV replication, flow cytometric analysis of CFSE-labeled cells was performed in the presence of 0.1, 1, 10, and 25 mM glucose. As shown in Fig 5D\u20135F, high glucose concentrations did not significantly affect proliferation and viability.",

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication suppresses cellular glucose uptake through downregulation of cell surface glucose transporters [29], while rotavirus infection impairs rabbit intestinal brush-border membrane Na+-solute cotransport activities [30]. However, the effects of coronaviruses (including TGEV) on glucose uptake have not been reported. we found that TGEV infection increased glucose uptake of IPEC-J2 cells and the protein expression of SGLT1, GLUT2 after 48 hpi (Fig 1), while TGEV infection in IPEC-J2 cells reached a peak at 48 hpi [31], we just provided foresight to explore the interaction between TGEV infection and glucose uptake, which is still worth exploring.",

            "text": "Most of the glucose absorbed in the intestine is transformed to glutamine [32], which was reported to promote the replication of many viruses, such as porcine circovirus (PCV) and HCMV, in vitro [33, 34]. Because viral replication requires a lot of energy, we examined the effects of glucose absorption on TGEV propagation. Our results demonstrate that increased glucose absorption enhanced TGEV replication, suggesting that glucose may be transformed into glutamine in infected cells. In this study, increases in SGLT1 and GLUT2 protein expression directly stimulated glucose uptake in vitro. Although the role of other transporters cannot be ruled out, as SGLT1 and GLUT2 dominate intestinal glucose transport, they may play important effect on glucose uptake in TGEV infection. However, no significant changes were observed in SGLT1 or GLUT2 mRNA expression levels, indicating that TGEV infection primarily affects the protein expression of SGLT1 and GLUT2. These findings were consistent with previous reports demonstrating that TGEV infection influences protein translation. Additionally, SGLT1 and GLUT2 have been shown to mediate intestinal glucose uptake through de novo synthesis of mRNA and protein [35]. Within the last decade, the mechanisms of passive or diffusive components of intestinal glucose uptake have come under debate [36]. The current paradigm describing intestinal uptake is that glucose enters the absorptive cell through SGLT1 in the brush-border membrane and exits into the blood through GLUT2, a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family, located in the basolateral membrane. We have now provided evidence for an alternative mechanism for the passive component of absorption, i.e., rapid trafficking of GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane was found to be controlled by the SGLT1-dependent activation of a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway and also by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling pathways [37\u201339]. GLUT2 exhibits a >10-fold-higher glucose transport capacity than SGLT1 and provides a major route of glucose absorption with rapid absorptive capacity [40, 41]. GLUT2 plays an important role in glucose absorption across the brush border membrane in normal jejunum [42]. Although our experiments did not directly demonstrate the rapid trafficking of GLUT2, we found that TGEV infection significantly increased glucose uptake at 48 h, indicating accelerated glucose absorption. Thus, TGEV infection might promote glucose trafficking through GLUT2. Moreover, because the TGEV increased the protein expression of p-EGFR (Fig 2B) and TGEV spike protein is capable of binding to EGFR, thereby activating the downstream PKC-dependent and MAPK intracellular signaling pathways [9], the trafficking of GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane could be stimulated, allowing rapid transport of glucose.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that glucose transport plays an important role in viral invasion. GLUT1-mediated glucose transport regulates HIV infection [43] and is a receptor for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV). Additionally, perturbations in glucose metabolism resulting from interactions between HTLV envelope proteins and GLUT1 are likely to contribute to HTLV-associated disorders [44]; thus, analysis of the relationship between viral infection and glucose uptake is critical. Notably, in mock-infected cells, EGFR mediate SGLT1 protein expression. Indeed, previous literatures reported that EGFR maintains intracellular glucose levels through interaction with and stabilization of SGLT1 [10] [18]. Importantly, we found that EGFR modulated SGLT1 expression during infection, but it cannot be concluded unfortunately that the cellular effect of TGEV infection on SGLT1 is mediated via EGFR. Because the drug treatment and knock down/overexpression against SGLT1 had similar effects with EGFR (Figs 3 and 4). In other words, it could also be direct effect on SGLT1, which in results in similar effect on EGFR. In fact, EGFR and SGLT1 are co-expressed in many other type cells [45, 46]. Moreover, previous studies have shown that EGFR is a target receptor for viruses and bacteria, including TGEV and Escherichia coli [9, 47]. Thus, because EGFR also interacts with SGLT1, this protein might comprise another ubiquitous target receptor.",
