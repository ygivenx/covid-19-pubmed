We screened for exposure to canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus type-1 (CAV-1), canine distemper virus (CDV), and canine herpesvirus (CHV), all of which can inflict morbidity and mortality in canids (Table S1) [13]\u2013[19]. In wolves, we also screened for exposure to Neospora caninum, a protozoan parasite whose life cycle includes canids, the definitive hosts where sexual reproduction takes place, and ungulates, the intermediate hosts [20], [21]. N. caninum is transmitted between canids and ungulates when a canid consumes infected ungulate tissue. N. caninum reproduces in the canid\u2019s intestines, and oocysts are shed in feces and then consumed by ungulates through contaminated forage and water. N. caninum infection can cause high rates of abortion in cattle, and thus is a pathogen of special interest to the local ranching community.",

Year effects were evaluated to test the evidence for temporal variation in exposure, location effects to determine whether NR wolves, living at higher densities, exhibited a higher risk of exposure compared to Interior wolves, and a year*location interaction to allow for the possibility that pathogens circulate at different times between the NR and Interior regions of the park. Among coyotes, we asked whether behavioral differences between residents and transients might contribute to differences in their risk of infection.

This high seroprevalence suggests low levels of disease-induced host mortality [50], [51] and high rates of transmission, perhaps aided by the stability of CPV in the environment [52]. We did not detect evidence for CPV-induced wolf-pup mortality, contrary to reports of suspected or confirmed CPV-induced mortality in the 1980s and early 1990s [53]\u2013[55], including among coyote pups in YNP [47]. Furthermore, CPV seroprevalence offered no explanation for pup-survival patterns because there was no annual variation in exposure to CPV among wolves or coyotes. However, it is possible that CPV either causes a constant, low level of mortality or periodic mortality when combined with other factors such as nutritional stress or co-infection with other pathogens, both scenarios of which our current methods would fail to detect.",

As hoofed-stock-to-canid transmission occurs through ingestion of infected tissue, livestock is likely not the source of canid exposure to N. caninum in YNP. While there is no information on N. caninum prevalence among YNP ungulates, other studies have detected N. caninum antibodies among deer (Odocoileus virginianus) [61], [62], bison, and moose (Alces alces) [63]. Thus, wild ungulates are suspected to be intermediate hosts and the source of exposure for YNP wolves. While wolves have not been shown to shed N. caninum oocysts, given the wolf\u2019s genetic similarity to dogs and coyotes, both of which shed oocysts [20], [64], infected wolves probably shed them as well. Although we had insufficient quantities of coyote and fox sera to screen for N. caninum, we suspect that exposure levels in at least coyotes would be similar to that of YNP wolves. We did not sample wild canids outside of YNP, and thus future research could employ a combination of serologic and genetic tools to look at the relationships between N. caninum in wild and domestic canids and ungulates in regions where N. caninum is of concern to local livestock producers. However, at this time, there is no evidence to suggest that N. caninum has been or will be significantly impacting either domestic or wild ungulates or canids in the GYE.",

For example, none of the Interior wolf pups handled in 1999 and 2005 had been exposed to CDV in contrast to the high levels of exposure found among the limited samples of Interior adults and NR adults and pups. These inconsistencies may be the result of small samples or differences in case-fatality rates across sampling locations. If all infected pups in the Interior died due to disease, those available for sampling would all be negative. It is also possible that the timing and point of disease introduction into YNP could account for these differences. CDV is generally thought to move quickly through populations as it is highly contagious, infected individuals shed virus for a relatively short time (mean duration of infectiousness  = 14 days, maximum 90 days), and the virus rapidly degrades in the environment (within hours at \u226520\u00b0C, and within several weeks at 0\u20134\u00b0C) [15], [16]. Thus, if CDV had entered from the south before pup birth or weaning, it could have swept through the Interior adults, sparing the young Interior pups protected by maternal antibodies but arriving on the NR when pups would be most vulnerable.",

However, there may be reason to suspect false positives in this particular case. In 2002, the two positive Interior pups had antibody titers just over the positive titer cutoff value (Positive antibody titer: \u226516), in contrast to marked increases in the titers observed among NR pups in 1999 and 2005 (Figure S1). Adult titers in the Interior and NR were not particularly high in 2002, either.

Once a wild or domestic canid is infected with CDV, the animal either recovers rapidly (mean time from infection to recovery [including latency and infectiousness]  = 21 days, maximum 120 days) with life-long immunity or dies [15], [16]. Thus, CDV requires a large population of susceptibles to persist, a population likely larger than YNP\u2019s canid community [69]. The low seroconversion between epizootics, if representative of true positives, suggests re-exposure from some wild or domestic host outside YNP or mistaken assumptions about the disease. For example, although no evidence exists for carrier states, loss of immunity, or imperfect protection against novel strains of CDV among canids, loss of CDV immunity has been documented in raccoons (Procyon lotor) [70]. If any of these factors pertained to canids, that could help explain the apparent persistence of CDV in YNP. Perhaps more likely, as there are multiple competent hosts for CDV within the GYE (e.g. short and long-tailed weasels, American martens, striped skunks, and raccoons), multi-host transmission might allow localized CDV persistence within the GYE.",

Although \u22658 young wolf-pup carcasses were located in 2005, all were too degraded for CDV isolation. We found several pup mandibles (n = 4) and handled two live pups during the winter of 2005\u20132006 displaying the distinctive tooth-enamel hypoplasia diagnostic of CDV [12], [71], [72]. Furthermore, several coyote dens appeared to experience high pup loss in 2005, with pups displaying neurologic symptoms consistent with late-stage CDV infection (E. Almberg, personal observation) [16]. More recent data suggests that CDV swept through the park again in 2008, and in addition to observing the same patterns of high CDV seroprevalence and very low wolf-pup survival, we recovered CDV ribonucleic acid via PCR from 3 dead wolves, all of which had been born after 2005 and thus presumably had no acquired immunity against CDV (Almberg, unpublished data). Despite the negative correlation between CDV exposure and pup survival, however, the ultimate causes of death could have been due to synergistic effects of CDV and another pathogen (e.g. CPV, CAV-1, canine coronavirus, or protozoan or helminth infections), such as with CDV and Babesia in Serengeti\u2019s lions [73]. Population impacts of pup mortality were short term, for the wolf population rebounded in both years following the 1999 and 2005 lows [27].",

Aside from the hypothesis that the timing of CDV introduction into the Interior either happened to be too early (e.g. 1999 and 2005) or too late (e.g. in 2002) to cause significant pup mortality, other plausible explanations for this lack of relationship include 1) that there was no CDV outbreak in 2002, and thus insufficient variation in exposure to detect a relationship with survival, and 2) that we failed to detect pup mortality due to bias in our sampling methods. The Interior packs\u2019 dens were remote and only visible from the airplane, and thus, on average, we made our first pup observations and obtained our first high counts of pups over a month later than those made on the NR (First pup observations, NR: \u03bcdate = 5/24, sd = 21 days, Interior: \u03bcdate =  6/26, sd = 27 days; First high pup count, NR: \u03bcdate = 6/19, sd = 34 days, Interior: \u03bcdate = 7/22, sd = 37 days). Because much microparasite-induced (e.g., viruses and bacteria) pup mortality takes place following weaning (i.e., at 10\u201312 weeks of age) in late June through early July, it is quite possible that we failed to detect most Interior pup mortality, yielding artificially high survival estimates.",

Also, cougars in YNP appeared to experience isolated outbreaks of CDV in 1991 and 1999 [74], lending support to the pattern of discrete, multi-host, CDV epizootics. Our own extremely limited fox data at least did not contradict the pattern of discrete CDV outbreaks; the single positive animal sampled in 1996 was \u22655 years old and thus could have been exposed as a kit during the 1989/90 outbreak, and the only other two positive animals were sampled in 2005. Furthermore, mustelids are highly susceptible to CDV, and the badger population on the NR appeared to have crashed in 2005 (E. Almberg, personal observation).
