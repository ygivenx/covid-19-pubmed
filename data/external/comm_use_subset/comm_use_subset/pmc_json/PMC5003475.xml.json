In particular, due to the mitochondrial genome\u2019s limited intra-specific variation but significant inter-specific divergence, partial nucleotide sequencing (barcoding) of certain mitochondrial loci for the purpose of species discrimination has gained widespread acceptance [2,3]. Two mitochondrial loci, cyt b (cytochrome b) and COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I), have gained particular prominence in this role [2,4]. Based on the pioneering work of Hebert and colleagues [5,6], the international barcode of life (IBOL) consortium, which seeks to generate millions of DNA barcodes for thousands of species world-wide, has adopted COI barcodes as the standard for studies on biodiversity throughout the animal kingdom [7].

With approximately 1,240 species worldwide, the chiroptera is the second largest order of mammals, comprising more than 20% of the species in the class Mammalia [10,11,12]. Moreover bats are now recognized as important hosts involved in the emergence and spread of animal and zoonotic viruses belonging to a wide range of families including the Rhabdoviridae (e.g., Rabies virus), Paramyxoviridae (e.g., Nipah and Hendra virus), Coronaviridae (e.g., SARS-CoV), and Filoviridae (e.g., Ebola and Marburg virus) [13,14,15,16]. Indeed many bat species figure prominently as the reservoirs for members of the Lyssavirus genus, family Rhabdoviridae, a group of negative strand RNA-viruses that are the causative agents of the zoonotic disease rabies [15,17].

            "text": "Rabies virus (RV) is the type species of this genus and the only Lyssavirus known to circulate in the Americas [17]. Throughout the continent, including Canada, multiple RV strains are maintained by specific wildlife hosts, of both carnivora and chiroptera orders, within discrete but overlapping geographic areas and there is a need for tools that discriminate both host species and viral strains [18,19,20]. Currently, hundreds of confirmed rabid bats are reported annually in North America [17] and the persistence of RV in a broad range of native bat species continues to be a public health hazard due to the high fatality rate of this disease and frequent failure of the public to associate bat contact and even superficial bites with potential rabies exposure [21,22]. While timely post-exposure or pre-exposure vaccination can prevent rabies in humans and other mammals, after onset of clinical disease the prognosis is extremely poor with almost 100% mortality [23]. Additionally, the persistence of RV in chiropteran hosts provides a source of potential cross-species infection for domestic animals and can, on rare occasions, result in the establishment of bat RV variants in terrestrial wildlife [24], events which have the potential to undermine rabies control activities in non-flying RV reservoir species. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology and geographical distribution of bat-associated RVs, including the species responsible for disease maintenance, would facilitate better risk management of this disease and limit its impact on the health of humans and domestic animals.

            "text": "In Canada, rabies diagnosis is routinely performed by the Rabies Centre of Expertise of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Large numbers of bats are submitted annually and species determination is currently based on traditional taxonomic methods in which the specimen is visually examined for anatomical features consistent with each species [25,26,27]. Although 17 species of bats are considered indigenous to Canada [28] three species, the spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii), and the western small-footed bat (Myotis ciliolabrum) rarely come in contact with humans due to their scarcity and/or their very limited ranges within Canada. As a result they are virtually never submitted for rabies testing. The pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) is also uncommon and very infrequently submitted so the vast majority of submitted specimens represent just 13 species. The bat samples received are often in poor condition due to decomposition or injury, or in some cases are incomplete (e.g., head only), thereby making species identification difficult or even impossible. In addition, some species (particularly of the Myotis genus) share highly similar physical features which further challenge species identification of these samples. To address these issues a recent study, which generated barcodes for 260 bat specimens representing 13 Canadian bat species, proposed the use of COI barcoding methods to improve species identification of submitted specimens [29]. Similar strategies involving sequence determination of other mitochondrial loci have been applied to confirm the nature of rabies reservoir species in Latin America [30], and to expand knowledge of the epidemiology of bat lyssaviruses in Europe [31]. However, to facilitate routine use of such an approach in a diagnostic setting it was determined that a highly automated method which could be applied by analysts not expert in complex molecular biology techniques would be highly valuable.",

A number of studies have combined microarray and DNA barcoding methods for identification of mammalian [34,35], insect [36], fish [37], bird [38], and fungal [39] species. Using these same principles this report describes the development of a universal PCR for amplification of the COI gene and the development of a microarray for differentiation of 14 Canadian bat species that represent virtually all specimens submitted to the CFIA for rabies diagnosis for the past 20 years. This study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach as a first step in the development of a novel user-friendly molecular method for bat species identification, a tool which will be invaluable in supporting bat rabies surveillance in Canada.

A previous study of the variation of the COI gene in 13 Canadian bat species required the use of four separate PCR reactions for successful amplification of the COI gene from all the species [29]. Refinement of this PCR to facilitate target amplification by a single universal primer set was a prerequisite for efficient microarray analysis. Accordingly, an alignment of all available 685 Canadian bat COI gene sequences was examined to assist with primer design. This revealed gaps in the required sequence information. Thus multiple sets of PCR primers flanking the COI gene were designed and used to amplify the entire COI gene of single specimens for 13 of the 14 targeted Canadian bat species, and the majority of the COI gene of the remaining species (tricolored bat). The information obtained from sequencing the COI amplicons allowed design of a single primer pair for partial amplification of the COI gene of all 14 species. These COI primers were AECOX-1TAG FWD-3.0 (5\u2032-TAGRTTTACAGYCTAATRCCTACTC-3\u2032) and AECOX-R1A (5\u2032-ACYTCAGGRTGRCCAAARAATCA-3\u2032).",

While many of the DNA samples included in this study were of poor quality based on analysis by gel electrophoresis (data not shown), all but one specimen were successfully amplified, including multiple samples from each target species. Thus these results indicate that for the vast majority of samples that were encountered, the universal PCR primers designed in this study can successfully replace the four separate PCRs [29] previously used to amplify the partial COI gene of the targeted bat species. The one sample that failed to amplify was badly decomposed and a weak product was only generated after switching to alternate primers that produced a slightly different amplicon of approximately the same size (data not shown). As shown in the following sections and Table 2, for the purpose of this application a sufficiently large COI sequence which encompasses significant genetic diversity to allow use of multiple capture probes is necessary for accurate species identification. However given the possibility that other suboptimal field specimens are likely to be encountered, reduction in amplicon size may improve PCR product yields as described in other studies which used smaller microcodes [45,46]. Thus amplification of this region of COI as two smaller multiplexed PCRs each <400 bp could be entertained. ",

Sequencing of the amplicon from sample #116 revealed that the KE1 probe binding region had a single mismatch with the penultimate nucleotide of the KE1 probe, while the amplicon from the other eight REB specimens had an additional mismatch with a nucleotide near the center of the KE1 probe (Table 3). Only four out of 42 COI sequences from REB in the custom database had the same sequence as sample #116 in the KE1 probe binding region while 38 out of 42 (90.5%) had two mismatches in the KE1 binding region. The observation that the majority of the REB CO1 sequences present in the database have two mismatches with the KE1 probe suggest that most REB specimens will likely not react with this probe.

However, in a previous study of Canadian bat barcoding, specimens of these three species were clearly assigned to discrete phylogenetic clades with the exception of just one specimen that could not unequivocably be designated as M. keenii or M. evotis [29]. The present study has employed a subset of the collection examined previously so that the phylogeny of all of these samples was already known. Unfortunately the unclassified specimen was not available for inclusion in this study but interrogation of its sequence revealed that it contained no mismatches with probe LE2, one mismatch with KE2 and two mismatches with both LB probes; accordingly it would most likely have been identified as M. evotis. Apart from this single sample, at least from a Canadian perspective, identification of these three species by barcoding and microarray analysis appears to be straightforward and a relatively large number of specimens belonging to these species have been tested in the current study. However, further COI characterization of specimens of these species throughout their ranges would be helpful in further defining the degree of inter-specific and intra-specific sequence diversity exhibited at this locus.",

This method could complement traditional taxonomic methods of species assignment especially when specimens are deteriorated, incomplete, or are of species that share highly related morphological features. Although only 14 of the 17 indigenous bat species were included in this study it is anticipated that as genetic information on the three remaining species is acquired, extra probes will be added to the microarray to allow their detection. Moreover, it is quite possible that climate change will result in the future northwards movement of bat species from the USA into Canada such that expansion of the array to enable identification of additional bat species will be required. One of the advantages of the microarray is the large number of capture probes that can be incorporated to provide additional redundancy and to increase assay resolution for differentiation of a larger number of species. This feature could potentially broaden the application of this technology to areas such as wildlife survey and conservation. Iatrogenic incursions of bats from further afield is also possible though probably highly infrequent; such specimens would likely give negative or inconclusive results with the microarray described and will likely require traditional barcoding or high density resequencing arrays for sequence characterization.",

            "text": "A number of prior studies have combined barcoding and microarray methods, mostly by employing traditional glass slide microarrays, to facilitate species identification. The scope of these prior studies varied widely. In one study Affymetrix technology was used to develop methods for the identification of a wide range of mammalian species [35]; another study targeted a range of European fish species [37]. Some studies have focused on more limited numbers of species restricted to specific regions and/or animal orders [34,38] while others have explored the utility of microarrays to identify species likely to transmit infectious disease agents [36,38]. While the present study has used a similar approach to design and validate a tool for a very specific purpose, further development of this technique could enlarge its applicability. One possibility is to expand the array for use in other jurisdictions by adding probes for the differentiation of a larger number of species, e.g., the 39 species of indigenous North American bats for which cases of rabies have been reported [49]. The principle could also be extended to the analysis of the much larger number of bat species that inhabit tropical regions of the Americas, many of which harbor RV variants [50]; indeed an array that identifies many neotropical bat species from Guyana based on their barcodes [8] has been described previously [35]. Alternatively, the adaptation of this method to novel far less labour intensive microarray platforms could be beneficial. For example, use of a single instrument that fully integrates and automates a complex molecular assay from nucleic acid extraction and gene amplification to array-based detection would yield a highly user-friendly microarray platform with a much more streamlined workflow. An instrument that uses an inexpensive bio-contained disposable reaction cartridge to perform such a workflow has recently been developed and applied to the detection of viruses responsible for human sexually transmitted diseases [51]. A fully automated and integrated assay for molecular species identification that does not require user handling after sample addition may be more cost-effective and rapid than DNA sequencing for applications described in this study. Thus, future work will focus on the adaptation of the methods described in this report to such highly automated platforms. As a result genetic-based tools for bat species identification will become more accessible, not only for laboratory based analysis but also for studies of bats in the field where live specimens could be rapidly and unequivocally identified using wing-punches or hair buds.

A microarray-based method for identification of chiropteran specimens to the species level was also successfully developed and validated with 153 field samples. This chiropteran PCR and microarray assay would allow unequivocal identification to species of most, if not all, bat specimens diagnosed as rabid in Canada. This new test for species assignment of rabies positive bats can be used in conjunction with existing methods for rabies virus typing to provide scientific information into the host range and host association of various rabies virus variants in bat species in Canada. The associations made between bat species and rabies virus variants will improve knowledge of rabies epidemiology and provide much needed information to support ongoing surveillance of rabies and to assess the public health risk to Canadians. Further planned expansion of this barcoding microarray assay to include more probes for redundancy and allow differentiation of additional species, and adaptation to a fully automated platform would make this technology accessible to a wider group of potential users such as those involved in wildlife conservation.

A cutoff of two times the standard deviation of the fluorescent intensity for all probes plus the mean fluorescent intensity of all probes was selected for each sample for positivity. Specific probes for each sample are indicated by a yellow box. All specimens were accurately assigned. The outlying signal with the KE1 probe is due to cross-reactivity with an eastern red bat (REB) specimen with a polymorphism which resulted in just a single mismatch to the Keen\u2019s bat probe (KE1). Panel\nB: Heat map of microarray results for 25 big brown bat (BBB) field specimens within the panel.
