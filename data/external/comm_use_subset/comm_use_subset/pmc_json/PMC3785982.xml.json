The threat of a global pandemic posed by outbreaks of influenza H5N1 (1997) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, 2002), both diseases of zoonotic origin, provoked interest in improving early warning systems and reinforced the need for combining data from different sources. It led to novel ideas, for example, the use of search query data from search engines such as Google [1,2] and Yahoo! [3] as an indicator of when and where influenza was occurring. This methodology has subsequently been extended to other diseases and has led to experimentation with new types of social media for disease surveillance as they have become available. Despite the emergence of disease surveillance as an innovative use of social media and search engine technologies, there is limited knowledge regarding the scope and efficacy of this novel application. With the potential to greatly improve disease surveillance and mitigation, there is a significant need to understand key chronological developments of the tools and methodologies in order to inform future endeavors and to assess this technology application for potential end-users.",

Scoping reviews are a structured and formal knowledge synthesis method that can be used to rapidly identify, characterize, and contextualize existing knowledge and gaps in research [6-8]. They represent a relatively new methodology that has increasingly been adopted in health and various other sectors [6], including recent applications in food safety and zoonotic public health [8-10]. The objective of this scoping review was to formally assess the current state of knowledge regarding the use of online search queries and social media for disease surveillance in order to inform and encourage future work on early detection and more effective mitigation of the effects of foodborne illness. We used structured scoping review methods to identify, characterize, and evaluate all published primary research, expert review, and commentary articles investigating or discussing the use of social media in surveillance of infectious diseases. The results are presented and discussed within the context of existing research knowledge, as well as the surveillance and policy needs, gaps, and opportunities.",

The search was limited to 2002 and onward to coincide with the wide use of Web 2.0 applications. A Scopus and Google Web search were also conducted to identify grey literature (eg, reports and newspaper articles); both were limited to the 100 most relevant hits. The Scopus Web search used the same search strategy as above, while the Google search used the query \u201csocial media for disease surveillance\u201d.

The first theme relates to the methodological aspects of the programs. In general, a variety of ontologies and search algorithms is used to synthesize and filter unstructured information from a variety of Web-based sources [15-21]. These sources can include news aggregates (eg, ProMed-mail), social media platforms (eg, Twitter), blogs, and search engine queries (eg, Google). Data sources can be characterized further as supply-based (eg, blogs and social media) or demand-based (eg, search behaviors) [18]. The overall principle behind these programs is that they aim to make sense of the public\u2019s \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d for purposes of early detection and effective control of infectious disease [15,18].",

A multidisciplinary and multijurisdictional approach is needed to allow adequate data collection, exchange, and evaluation and communication across multiple jurisdictions and wide geographical areas [18,20,21]. Social media programs can allow international networks of food safety, public health, and other professionals to communicate via virtual networks, which can facilitate collaborations and support public health response infrastructure [19-22]. One example is virtual situation rooms using a three-dimensional interface, where public health professionals can collaborate and discuss surveillance data in real-time [20]. However, government and public health officials must be adequately trained and skilled in order to utilize these tools for disease surveillance in an effective and timely way [15,21].",

One of the most important challenges relates to the validity and reliability of the data analysis. For example, several authors discussed the need to properly filter out background noise (eg, people searching out of curiosity rather than illness) to ensure that the surveillance data reflect actual disease trends and are not a result of heightened media exposure or other biases [15,17,19,21,23,25,26]. In addition, there are still certain segments of the population that do not regularly use the Internet or social media programs, particularly in developing countries, so the users of these programs may not accurately represent the general population [20,24,25,27]. Another challenge relates to the ownership of the data and the issues surrounding user information privacy and confidentiality [21,27]. Most authors agreed that more evaluation, validation, and development of these programs is needed before they should be widely used in practice [17,20,25,26,28].",

Eysenbach devised a clever method to circumvent this restriction and acquired data on searches related to influenza through a strategic combination of bids for targeted Google keywords and placement of an influenza-related advertisement. He then developed a model for detecting influenza outbreaks in Canada based on changes in Canadians\u2019 searches for information on influenza. When evaluated against the gold standard for influenza surveillance (reports by sentinel physicians of clinical encounters with influenza-like illness), the model proved to be more timely, accurate, and inexpensive [1].

Whereas there is a lag of 1-2 weeks in tracking influenza, most foodborne disease outbreaks are not detected for several months after they occur, by which time the outbreak and opportunity for intervention are virtually over. A Chinese study by Zhou et al in 2010 [30] used both Baidu search queries and Baidu news articles to track infectious diseases including dysentery. They were able to reduce the distorting effect of disease-related news reports by using a combination of search frequency data and news count data.

Unofficial reports were first taken into consideration by the moderated mailing list ProMED-mail, which was launched in 1994 [15]. Detection and investigation of \u201crumors\u201d from news feeds and websites formed the basis of the Global Public Health Intelligence Network in 1997: a joint project of the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization [1,15]. These examples set a precedent for the adoption of search queries and social media as a supplement to existing surveillance activities, in keeping with the reported recommendations of the scoping review (Table 2). Adoption, even as supporting systems for existing surveillance, will entail a high level of familiarity with the tools and collaboration across organizations and jurisdictions.",

Computers can learn to distinguish useful messages based on word associations providing an automated method to deal with millions of tweets, using tools such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifier [31,34]. The potential for false positives and false negatives was identified as one of the most commonly reported weaknesses by this scoping review (Table 2). One of the primary challenges is to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise.

Just as influenza can be transported around the world in a matter of hours, our increasingly complex global food-supply chain presents a growing challenge to governments attempting to ensure a safe food supply in the face of dwindling budgets. Foodborne outbreaks can be notoriously difficult to detect as they can be widely distributed geographically and may be due to an ingredient that is found in a number of foods. Foodborne illness is also vastly underreported since most people who are affected do not seek medical attention nor receive laboratory confirmation of the causative agent (necessary steps to trigger declaration of an outbreak). Newkirk et al [41] make the case for using real-time data from social media to bypass significant delays in traditional foodborne surveillance activities, estimating a potential savings of 5-19 days in the reporting timeline for salmonellosis.",

Both the tools themselves and the methodologies for exploiting them are evolving over time. The growing evidence base regarding the utility of social media for disease surveillance will hopefully encourage academia, industry, the public service, and international organizations to consider social media in a serious light, particularly as a means of engagement rather than just disseminating information. While their accuracy, speed, and cost compare favorably with existing surveillance systems, the primary challenge is to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise. Further developments in digital disease surveillance have the potential to improve sensitivity and specificity: passively through advances in machine learning and actively through engagement of users. Although learning to use and adapt these new tools will take some time and effort, the greater challenge will be the multilevel collaboration among local, regional, national, and international authorities that will be required to use them most effectively.",
