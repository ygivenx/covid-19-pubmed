The publication by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of estimates for the burden of very many diseases in very many countries drew sharp responses, in two waves. The first wave focused largely on technical issues. Academics and health officials from several countries were confronted with estimates they found hard to reconcile with the facts as they saw them; this led to many questions about data sources [6\u201310]. Experts working globally on specific disease areas questioned methods, complaining that they could not see the workings inside the \u2018black box\u2019 of IHME models [3,11]. Rumbling under both of these areas of concern was a larger discomfort, which built into a second wave of responses, questioning power relationships in global health.",

Who is making the estimates, and by what right? How \u2018robust\u2019 are they, and how \u2018legitimate\u2019 [12\u201320]? Several contributors to this debate recognised that data and concepts in global health are institutionally and politically constructed: a health issue rises up the international agenda because people deemed to be experts have used accepted methods to demonstrate its importance, and have communicated that in forums which entrench that importance (and which influence funding decisions). But there has been less discussion of how these constructions come about. Who designates the experts? Which methods are considered robust? Which forums confer legitimacy to communicated data? Whose funding decisions are influenced?",

We believe that health data and estimates at any level are only useful if they are demonstrably used to improve the health of individuals other than those (including ourselves) who make a comfortable living out of the health estimates industry.

(Phrases in italics are verbatim quotes from discussants.) We argue that health estimates are deeply embedded in specific social, economic, political and ideational contexts that differ at different levels of the global health architecture [22].

These surveys, like routine data collection, are generally carried out by government staff. This creates an institutional imperative to use the data: they are locally owned, produced by colleagues who may be directly involved in communicating results and who can help explain anomalies in the data and their meaning in the specific local situation [25]. These empirical data are seen as robust in that they are concrete, easy to interpret and directly relevant to the local context [26].

One year, national health ministries will be bombarded with requests for data about drowning. Another year, the demand may be for data about dental or mental health [27\u201329].

It depends also on whether and how data are communicated to users; on whether and how those users trust the source of, understand and accept the data; and on the extent to which they have the capacity to combine data with existing knowledge and give meaning to them for their specific aims in their specific local situation [37,40]. These processes are in turn shaped on the demand side by the political and institutional cultures of potential users and their perceived need for the data. On the supply side, they are shaped by the constellation that is calling the shots intellectually, financially and institutionally.",

We contend that the two are not opposed, because we believe there is nothing productive about pumping out technically credible data that are not used to improve health. Social and political engagement are not substitutes for technical validity, but are an integral component of data and knowledge that are widely accepted and used.",

To do that well, they must by definition engage with both the policy-makers and the local communities; effective local knowledge-generation processes are thus inherently the most socially robust among those who make key decisions. Much locally produced data can be aggregated upwards to meet national and international needs. This is not always the case, however. (Brazil, for example, reports the percentage of women who have had seven antenatal visits rather than the globally standardised indicator based on four visits.) In this case engaging international actors can lead either to acceptance by supra-national bodies of local standards or to technical and/or financial support for new data collection efforts, where these would represent a benefit to local actors also.",

The WHO and other international organisations are wary of prolonged consultation in part because it disrupts the production schedule demanded by their paymasters, and in part because ministries of health often pressure them to publish estimates deemed politically acceptable. We believe that\u2019s an argument for more consultation, not less. The widest possible engagement, including with academic institutions and civil society organisations at the national level, protects against lopsided political pressure. It also makes use of local knowledge; that\u2019s generally an improvement on the knowledge generated by a globally standardised computer programme. The experience in developing national and sub-national HIV estimates, described by Mahy and colleagues in this volume, provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of this approach.",

This requires ongoing interaction, trust and a communicative infrastructure that support genuine consultation and dialogue, not just between producers of global estimates and national health authorities, but within countries, between those who have knowledge to contribute \u2013 very often groups with a stake in the outcome, who are also in a position to promote appropriate action.",
