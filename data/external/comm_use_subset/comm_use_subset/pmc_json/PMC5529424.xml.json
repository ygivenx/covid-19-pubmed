            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious disease caused by the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). IB causes substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. IBV affects chickens of all ages causing upper respiratory disease, nephritic syndromes, and decreased egg production1. IBV has been circulating in China since 1982. The epidemiology of IBV in China is complicated due to the large geographical area, and multiple IBV genotypes and serotypes are known to coexist2. Our previous epidemiology monitoring during 2004 to 2012, found at least seven genotypes of IBV circulating. In that study, the QX-like IBV genotype that causes nephritis had become predominant in China3\u20136. Although IBV vaccines are widely used and most commercial chickens have been vaccinated, there are still frequent outbreaks of IB that cause clinical disease and production problems7\u20139. For example, widespread use of vaccines derived from Massachusetts (Mass) serotypes such as H120 and H52 did not prevent frequent outbreaks of IB in chicken flocks10, 11.",

Its genome is linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is approximately 27.6 kilobases (kb) in length. As with other coronaviruses, the IBV S1 glycoprotein contains virus neutralizing epitopes and serotype-specific sequences12, 13. The S1 protein is involved in infectivity and plays an important role in attachment to the host cell, as well as induction of neutralizing antibodies14. Given the importance of the S1 protein virus/host interactions, IBV genetic analysis and research of IBV has been primarily based on the S1 gene15.",

S1 variability is due in part to the lack of proofreading by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) that introduces mutations into the viral genome during replication. Variation is also introduced by the specific template switching mechanism used by coronaviruses, which frequently leads to genetic recombination17, 18. At least 30 serotypes of IBV have been identified worldwide. Vaccine cross-protection between serotypes is minimal19. Therefore, phylogenetic and genetic analyses have become tools for monitoring the molecular evolution of IBV and provide a fast and accurate method for genotype classification. In some studies, the genotype analyses have been used to predict IBV serotype and used to inform vaccine selection20.",

Different from the Orthomyxovirus and Paramyxovirus, the cleavage site motifs of IBV were not related to host cell, serotype and pathogenicity, but more likely related to geographic origin21. However, the cleavage site motifs of IBV has become complex and diverse in many regions with the spread of IBV in worldwide. Similarity analyses showed the similarities of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences ranged from 63.1\u201399.9% and 60.2\u2013100%, respectively. These results indicated that the S1 gene of the field isolates was highly variable.

All the QX-type reference strains in this study including the classical strains QXIBV, A2, and LX4 were grouped in Cluster I. While 48 isolates were grouped to Cluster I, they were in different terminal evolutionary branches from the classical QX-type reference strains (QXIBV, A2 and LX4).",

Therefore, all the newly isolated QX-type strains deviated evolutionarily from the classical strains. Sequence alignment of 95 QX-type strains with reference strain QXIBV was performed. The result showed that there were large variations in some nucleotides universally between the two sub-genotype strains (Supplement Table S2).

The five field isolates and the pathogenic 4/91 strain has the same nucleotides in positions 283, 1522, and 1589. In contrast, the vaccine 4/91 strain has mutations at these three positions that lead to attenuating amino acid substitutions (95, 508 and 530)25. The membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes from the field isolates located in phylogenetic clusters and shared high nucleotide similarity with Chinese reference strains rather than 4/91 vaccine or pathogenic strain (Supplement Fig. S2).

The results of RDP analysis were confirmed by a SimPlot analysis (Fig. 3).

One hypothesis is that the development and use of a QX-type attenuated vaccine has reduced the level of infection in some areas31\u201333. The two clusters of S1 genes for the QX-type strains collected here were variable and evolutionarily distinct from the classical strains (QXIBV, LX4, and A2). This may be attributable to the accumulation of mutations, including insertions and deletions, and recombination of small segments of the S1 gene. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these genetic changes influence the antigenic characterization of QX-type strains.",

Due to the geographical separation between Taiwan and mainland China, the IBV strains found in Taiwan are evolutionarily distinct from IBV genotypes in mainland China and other countries34. The TW-type is divided into the TW I and TW II subgroups. The strains isolated from Taiwan before 1990 were primarily TW II genotypes associated with respiratory symptoms. The TW I genotype strains isolated after the 1990s were primarily associated nephritis. Vaccination with Mass-type (H120, H52, and Ma5) and 4/91 vaccines is common in Taiwan, but TW I-type IBV continues to break out frequently35. Prior to 2009, the TW-type strain was rare in mainland China5, 23. However, since 2009 the prevalence of TW I-type IBV has been increasing in mainland China from 7.5% (2009\u20132010) to 16.1% (2011\u20132012), and TW II-type isolates are also being found6. In this study, the TW I-type strains accounted 27.4% of isolated strains. More isolates of this genotype had been reported in China mainland36, 37. Notably, the prevalence of TW I-type strains was greater than QX-type strains in Guangdong Guangxi, and Fujian, and was the predominant genotype in all three provinces. Geographically, these three provinces are all on the southeast coast of China and close to Taiwan. It is possible that migrating birds introduced the TW-type strains to these areas. The TW I-type strain might be increasing in prevalence due to selective pressure from vaccination on other genotypes and the lack of vaccine efficacy against the TW I-type strains. Currently, there is little known about the biological characteristics of TW I-type IBV in mainland China.",

We found evidence that the pathogenic 4/91 strain is actively involved in recombination with native Chinese strains, suggesting that 4/91 has become an important gene donor in the genetic evolution of IBV in China. While the 4/91 vaccine is not officially approved for use in China, it is widely used on chicken farms. There is a risk that the recombination between the 4/91 vaccine strains and other virulent native Chinese strains (such as QX-type) and formed recombinant virulent strain.

In this study, serotype classification was determined based on a two-way cross-neutralization assay performed in SPF chicken embryos. Relevant for vaccination control, the viral genotypes and serotypes of the vaccine strains were distinct from those of the most prevalent Chinese strains. We also observed a marked inconsistency between the viral genotype and serotype. This may be attributable to mutation of antigenic epitopes in S1 or immunity elicited to other IBV proteins such as S2 or N. Identifying the antigenic profile of emergent IBV isolates is important for vaccine development and effective control of disease outbreaks caused by variant strains. Antigenic cartography has been widely used to understand antigenic variation of the influenza A virus27. In this study, 3D antigenic cartography was applied to IBV. The results of the 3D cartography analysis were consistent with serotype classification by ARV. 3D antigenic cartography has the advantage of being intuitive and can be more easily visualized.
