            "text": "Hantaviruses are enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Bunyaviridae family, which are pathogenic to humans and are having a growing impact on global public health (1). In Europe and Asia, Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), Puumala virus (PUUV), Seoul virus (SEOV), and Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. By contrast, in North and South American, Sin Nombre virus (SNV), Andes virus (ANDV), and New York virus are major pathogenic species that lead to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) (also called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, HPS) in humans (2\u20134). Each of the species gives rise to diseases with a broad spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute fever and hemorrhage, and even life-threatening shock and acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute respiratory injury (ARI) (5\u20137). In China, HTNV is the common pathogenic species causing severe HFRS. A total of 1,625,002 cases were reported during 1950\u20132014, accounting for approximately 90% of the total global cases, with a case-fatality rate as high as 15% (5, 8). In the United States, approximately 4,000 HCPS cases have been reported since 1993 and showed a higher case-fatality rate of approximately 36% (3, 9). Of note, rapid evolution and genetic reassortment between different hantavirus strains promote novel hantavirus expansion and the emergence of new epidemic characteristics, which introduces more challenges to prevent and control infection (10\u201314). Due to the limited understanding of the disease pathogenesis, no specific therapy is currently used. Vaccination is the most appropriate way to protect humans against virus infection, and although several vaccines have been generated by inactivation of the hantavirus, only a few of them are commercially produced and licensed for application in humans (8). In China, individuals immunized with HTNV-inactivated vaccine may still develop HFRS disease (15\u201317). There remains an urgent need to generate more effective vaccines to better prevent HTNV infection.",

            "text": "The HTNV genome consists of S, M, and L segments, which encode nucleocapsid protein (NP), precursor of Gn and Gc glycoproteins (GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively (13). The two structural proteins NP and GP give rise to the primary antigenicity of HTNV and are responsible for the vigorous humoral and cellular immune responses. Our previous results showed that T-cell responses during the acute phase of HFRS in patients are characterized by multifunctional T helper (Th) cell responses and vigorous cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses (18\u201321). Patients with mild/moderate severity show vigorous HTNV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against HTNV, while patients with severe/critical severity tend to have weak T-cell responses (19\u201321). Araki el al. found that HTNV infection was maintained in the presence of high titers of neutralizing antibodies, indicating that antibodies alone cannot eliminate the virus. Notably, NP was undetectable after adoptive transfer of HTNV-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that HTNV-specific CD8+ T cells are the major effector cells against the virus and contribute to the clearance of HTNV (22, 23). Moreover, individuals who had been infected with PUUV or HTNV maintained virus-specific memory CTLs many years after acute infection, revealing the importance of CTLs in preventing a second infection (24\u201326). Therefore, further identification of the CTL epitopes and exploration of the mechanism of CTL responses against HTNV infection are very desirable for the development of an effective vaccine for HFRS.",

            "text": "To date, most HTNV-specific CTL epitopes identified are distributed on NP (6, 27, 28). Early research identified three CTL epitopes on HTNV NP (25, 29). Recently, we also reported eight HTNV NP-specific CTL epitopes that were restricted by various HLA alleles including A2, A11, A24, B7, and B35 (6, 20, 30). It has been demonstrated that GP are the major antigens involved in the induction of neutralizing antibodies and play an important role in eliciting humoral immune responses to protect infected animals and humans against lethal hantavirus infection (17, 31). However, Kilpatrick et al. discovered that patients with HPS during early SNV infection showed higher frequencies of Gc epitope-specific CD8+ T cells than those of NP epitope-specific CD8+ T cells (32). Tobias et al. found that ANDV Gn-derived peptides were the immunodominant epitopes eliciting specific CD8+ T responses compared with those from NP and Gc. While NP-specific responses declined, Gn-specific responses remained readily detectable up to 13 years after infection (33). Hence, we assumed that HTNV GP-derived peptides may function as epitopes to induce effective CTL responses against HTNV infection. Recently, an HTNV Gn-derived H-2Kb-restricted CTL epitope (ITSLFSLL) was identified (34), confirming our hypothesis that there are specific CTLs against HTNV GP-derived epitopes. However, H-2Kb-restricted CTL epitopes may not induce parallel responses in humans, screaming HLA class I allele-restricted epitopes could provide additional help for better understanding of the recognition of HTNV by human CTLs. Importantly, Chinese Han populations in different regions have a similar allelic diversity, among which HLA-A*02 is the most common HLA class I allele (35, 36). Hence, the identification of HLA-A*02-restricted HTNV GP-specific CTL epitopes could be a promising, broadly applicable approach to the prevention of HTNV infection.",

T2 cells are transporter-associated cells with antigen processing (TAP)-deficient and defective for endogenous MHC class I presentation. Although T2 cells express a very low level of the HLA-A*0201 molecule under normal culture conditions, they express HLA-A*0201 molecules at much higher levels after binding to appropriate peptides that stabilize the expression of HLA-A*0201 on the cell surface (40). To further determine the binding capability of predicted HTNV GP nonapeptides to HLA-A*0201 molecules, the T2 cell binding assay was performed as described elsewhere (41). Briefly, T2 cells were incubated with 50 \u00b5mol/L peptides and 1 \u00b5mol/L human \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22 m, Sigma) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 18 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.

Seven nonapeptides were successfully used to synthesize tetramers, whereas the nonapeptide VPV9 could not form a stable peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramer complex. Thus, we used the seven peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers to determine whether the nonapeptides could be recognized by CD8+ T cells and quantify the frequencies of the nonapeptide-specific CD8+ T cells. HLA-A*02+ patients with a different severity of HFRS were tested at the acute phase during hospitalization. HLA-A*02+ subjects who were seronegative for HTNV served as NC. Epitope-specific tetramer+ CD8+ T cells could be detected in PBMCs, indicating that seven nonapeptides could be recognized by TCRs of CD8+ T cells (Figure 2A). The frequencies of HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in PBMCs are presented as medians with their corresponding IQRs.

Notably, the frequencies of seven HTNV GP nonapeptide-specific CD8+ T cells in the patients with mild/moderate disease were significantly higher than these in the patients with severe/critical disease and NC (p < 0.05, Figure 2B), indicating that the seven HTNV GP-derived epitopes might induce protective CTL responses in HLA-A*02+ HFRS patients. In addition, epitopes VV9-, SL9-, LL9-, and VI9-specific CD8+ T cells revealed higher frequencies compared with other epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in patients with mild/moderate disease and showed significantly higher frequencies in patients with severe/critical disease than these in NC (p < 0.05, Figure 2B), while no significant difference was found between VFV9-, SV-, and FL-specific CD8+ T cells of patients with severe/critical disease and NC. This may due to the better capability of epitope VV9, SL9, LL9, and VI9 to stimulate proliferation of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells.",

Thus, we used single peptide or a peptide mixture (including the seven nonapeptides) to stimulate PBMCs of HLA-A*02+ patients with HFRS, and detected the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells by ELISPOT assay. Notably, the results showed that either the peptide mixture or single peptide could induce IFN-\u03b3 production from the PBMCs of HFRS patients in vitro (Figure 3A), indicating that each of the seven HTNV GP epitopes could effectively elicit epitope-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting T-cell responses. Next, we analyzed the positive responses at the single-peptide level. For the limited ELISPOT data of each peptide, we could not perform the statistical analysis between different severity groups. Here, we showed the numbers of epitope-specific CTLs and make a comparison between HFRS patients and NC. The numbers of epitope-specific CTLs are presented as medians with their IQRs. There were 73 (35\u2013114) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope VFV9, 41 (8\u2013112) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope VV9, 57 (32\u2013164) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope SV9, 61 (35\u201390) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope SL9, 33 (6\u2013101) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope FL9, 62 (51\u201387) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope LL9 and 33 (2\u201372) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope VI9 in HFRS patients, and 9 (1\u201315) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope VFV9, 15 (11\u201320) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope VV9, 10 (4\u201310) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope SV9, 12 (8\u201313) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope SL9, 10 (7\u201313) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope FL9, 9 (7\u201315) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope LL9, and 10 (7\u201317) SFC/106 PBMCs for epitope VI9 in NC. The numbers of epitopes VFV9-, SV9-, SL9-, and LL9-specific CD8+ T cells were larger in HFRS patients than these in NC (p < 0.05, Figure 3B). Notably, when remove the data of patients with severe/critical disease (red dots), the numbers of epitope VV9-specific CD8+ T cells were also significantly larger than that in NC (p < 0.05, Figure 3B), indicating patients with milder disease may have higher VV9-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. The median numbers of epitope-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting CTLs in different disease severity group also showed the same tendency that patients with milder disease severity had more epitope-specific IFN-\u03b3-secreting CTLs than these in patients with severer disease severity (Table S1 in Supplementary Material).",

In this study, we first identified seven HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes based on their high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules, ability to bind to TCRs and ability to elicit IFN-\u03b3-producing CTL responses. Importantly, the frequencies of seven epitope-specific CTLs were higher in patients with mild/moderate severity than in those with severe/critical severity. Notably, epitopes VV9, SL9, and LL9 showed higher binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 molecules and frequencies of epitope-specific CTLs in PBMCs of HFRS patients. Further evidence indicated that immunization with epitopes VV9, SL9, and LL9 successfully generated protective CTL responses to inhibit HTNV infection after HTNV challenge in HLA-A2.1/Kb Tg mice. Especially, immunization with epitope LL9 dramatically inhibited HTNV replication in all target organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) of Tg mice, which suggested that epitope LL9 might be a good candidate for use in the design of effective HTNV peptide vaccines against HTNV.",

            "text": "Vaccination is the most effective means for preventing viral infection. However, individuals immunized with HFRS vaccine may still develop HFRS disease due to limited neutralizing antibodies secreting or cellular immune responses (15\u201317). Thus, the development of more effective HTNV vaccines is necessary. Emerging results have revealed that vaccines that strictly elicit immunodominant epitope-specific CTL responses could be more effective against viruses. Vaccines that induce both immunodominant and subdominant epitope responses were significantly less protective than vaccines that only elicited immunodominant epitope-specific responses, suggesting that the increased breadth of T-cell epitope recognition may prevent the induction of optimal protective CTL immunity and reduce the efficiency of host immunity against pathogens (43, 44). The secondary CTL expansion in vaccinated mice competes for antigen accessibility on antigen-presenting cells, suppressing the priming of other protective pathogen-specific CTLs (45) and potentially explaining how subdominant epitope vaccination could reduce immunodominant epitope-induced CTL responses. Since HFRS vaccines have the potential to elicit both immunodominant and subdominant epitope-specific CTL responses, immunization with the inactivated vaccines may restrict the induction of optimal CTL responses. Notably, peptide vaccines are available for targeted prevention by eliciting epitope-specific CTL responses. The identification of protective immunodominant epitopes from HTNV may be feasible for the design of safer and more effective vaccines against HTNV infection. The Chinese Han population has developed stable gene polymorphisms of the HLA -A, -B and -DRB1 loci over a long evolutionary process in which HLA-A*02 alleles predominate as much as 29.7% (35, 36). Thus, we focused on HLA-A*02-restricted immunodominant epitopes.",

Interestingly, our results showed that patients with mild/moderate HFRS severity during the acute phase had higher frequencies of HTNV GP epitope-specific CTLs than patients with severe/critical severity, suggesting that these epitope-specific CTLs might play protective roles to reduce the severity of HFRS at early time points by recognizing the epitopes presented on HTNV-infected cells. The tetramer+ results of 0.1% or less, which were approximate to the frequencies of NC, were mainly in patients with severe/critical HFRS, also suggesting that patients with lower frequencies of HTNV GP-specific CTLs during the early time of HTNV infection may develop severer HFRS. These results are consistent with our previous studies showing that increased and vigorous HTNV NP-specific CTL responses correlated with milder HFRS (19, 20). Other studies also indicated the protective effect of CTL responses. In a hamster model, activation of T-cell immune responses was not responsible for the immunopathogenesis of HPS-like disease, but perhaps the innate immune responses, either elicited from infected endothelial cells, macrophages or neutrophils, contributed to the disease (46). In a mouse model of persistent infection, almost no IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells were detected, while mice with transient infection showed increased functional HTNV-specific CTLs (23, 47). HTNV-specific T-cell responses in patients with severe HFRS were heavily impaired at the early stage of infection, indicating that an initial failure to mount strong T-cell responses may be the primary cause of the progression of acute HTNV infection into severe HFRS (27). In our study, when remove the ELISPOT data of patients with severe/critical disease, the numbers of epitope VV9-specific CD8+ T cells were significantly larger than that in NC, indicating patients with milder disease may have more functional epitope-specific CD8+ T cells. Thus, functional HTNV epitope-specific CTLs at early time points of HTNV infection are important for HTNV clearance and prevention of HFRS development. We demonstrated that the seven HTNV GP nonapeptides were able to induce IFN-\u03b3-producing CTL responses. Considering that patients with milder severity had higher frequencies of epitope-specific CTLs during the acute phase of infection, we speculated that HTNV GP epitope-specific CTLs might have been generated at an early time point after HTNV infection and elicited effective protective IFN-\u03b3-producing CTL responses against HTNV in patients with milder HFRS rather than in those with more severe infection.",

There are some important factors that influence the balance between protective CTL responses that contribute to viral clearance and intense activation of CTLs that may trigger immunologic injury. Different HLA allele restrictions and virus species may be the considerable factors that impact CTL responses and disease outcome, which should be taken into account in studies of CTL responses against virus infection. Notably, in Kilpatrick\u2019s study, the total frequencies of three SNV epitope-specific CTLs reached 44.2% in patients with severe HPS, while those in patients with moderate HPS did not exceed 10% (32). In the present study, the frequencies of each HTNV GP epitope-specific CTL maintained a relatively lower range (0.02\u20131.17%). Our previous study also showed that HTNV NP epitope FA9-specific CTLs, which also contributed to milder HFRS, maintained a lower frequency (0.01\u20130.70%).

Tuuminen et al. also found that PUUV NP epitope-specific CTLs measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT were lower in acute PUUV infection, indicating that increased epitope-specific CTLs which can be visualized by direct tetramer staining may not readily detectable by an in vitro functional assay such as IFN-\u03b3 ELSIPOT (48). Both tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay met validation criteria, while the tetramer staining showed better precision (49, 50). Tetramer staining mimics the molecular interaction between peptide-HLA complexes and TCRs that initiate T-cell activation in vitro. ELISPOT assay relies on a functional readout of cytokine secretion in situ to enumerate responding T cells (51). The overwhelming amount of antigen and different thresholds of peptide stimulation may drive the T cells into apoptosis by activation-induced cell death and lead clonal exhaustion (52, 53). Exhausted and terminally differentiated cells could die during lengthy incubation (24\u201348 h) before producing enough IFN-\u03b3 to be measured by ELISPOT assay. As to tetramer staining, the unresponsive cells could be measured, which may explain why the frequencies of epitope-specific CTLs tested by ELISPOT were lower (54). CTLs in a dysfunctional state could be restored after incubation with IL-2, suggesting that cytokines produced by Th cells may maintain the function of the CTLs (55), However, antigen-specific CTLs may lack effector activity in vitro for loss of other stimulation in vivo and could not be detected by ELISPOT, which could also contribute to the differences between tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay. Hobeika et al. set the mean + 2 SDs of response of CMV seronegative subjects as cutoff values and found that both tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay had a high sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 95\u2013100% (56). In our study, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff value for a positive versus negative tetramer score. When set the optimal operating point, which showed the largest positive likelihood ratio, as the cutoff value of each tetramer staining, the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 57.7 to 100% and from 60 to 90% (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Among them, LL9/HLA-A*0201 tetramer staining had a high sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90% with the cutoff value 0.09%, which may have the potential to be applied to clinical assistant diagnostic of HTNV infection.",

Humanized mice, which are mice engrafted with human tissue and/or engineered to express human genes, can mimic human immunity against species-restricted pathogens in vivo. The humanized HLA-A2.1/Kb Tg mice, which express a chimeric gene consisting of the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of HLA-A*0201 molecule and the \u03b13 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of H-2Kb, can be a powerful tool to establish an HTNV replication model and explore the effect of immune responses primed by HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes in vivo (6, 57). Here, vaccination with HLA-A*0201-restricted HTNV GP epitopes VV9, SL9 and LL9 significantly reduced HTNV antigen levels and RNA loads in target organs of HLA-A2.1/Kb Tg mice compared with Tg mice injected with PBS or immunized with the control peptide VY9 after HTNV challenge, indicating that three HTNV GP epitopes all could induce protective CTL responses to inhibit HTNV replication and might elicit similar effects in humans. Although the proteomes of pathogens contain abundant peptides that have the potential to act as MHC I-restricted epitopes, CTL responses tend to be focused on some limited dominant epitopes, which are considered to be good candidates for vaccines (58). LL9-immunized Tg mice had lower HTNV antigens and RNA loads levels compared with LL9- and SL9-immunized Tg mice and even showed equivalent levels in kidneys compared with HTNV vaccine-immunized mice, suggesting that LL9 might function as an immunodominant epitope to induce optimal CTL responses against HTNV infection.",

In our study, the immunodominant epitope LL9 (aa358\u2013aa366) also derives from Gn (aa19\u2013aa648), while the subdominant epitopes VV9 (aa8\u2013aa16) and SL9 (aa996\u2013aa1004) are located in a region of the signal peptide (aa1\u2013aa18) and Gc (aa649\u2013aa1135), respectively. Thus, the immunodominance of Gn is an interesting finding. Hantaviruses contain conserved tyrosine residues near the C-terminus of Gn that form an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) (aa611\u2013aa634 for HTNV), which could promote polyubiquitination of the Gn polypeptide to facilitate its degradation via the proteasome (46, 59). The proteasome generates the epitopes presented on MHC I molecules that elicit CTL responses (60). After hantavirus infection, increased Gn epitopes produced by enhanced ITAM-regulated degradation are presented on the cell surface with MHC I molecules, and then the epitopes are recognized by specific CTLs and induce high-frequency CTL responses against target cells, which might explain the more effective Gn-related vaccine-induced CTL inhibition of virus replication after virus challenge in vivo.",

The specific consensus peptide motif for HLA-A*0201 is a 9-mer peptide with dominant anchor residues of leucine (L) at position 2 and valine (V) or leucine (L) at the C-terminus (39). Interestingly, the LL9 sequence LIWTGMIDL is relatively conserved in SEOV (LIWRGLIDL) and DOBV (LIWEGYIDL) and is characterized by invariable primary anchor residues and few substitutions of the internal sequence. Although the internal sequence contexts of individual peptides would affect the binding affinity to MHC I molecules (either increase or decrease the binding affinity), substitutions of the secondary anchor amino acids at positions (3, 6, and 7) seems to have a limited effect on the immunogenic properties of peptides (39). More encouragingly, it has been demonstrated that HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides derived from influenza A virus proteins could elicit broad protection against distinct strains based on the induced-fit molecular mimicry of the TCR effectively targeting mutated peptides (61). Hence, it is possible that LL9 may induce CTL responses against SEOV and DOBV, which are also major causative agents of HFRS (3, 4).",

Mixtures of synthetic peptides derived from cat allergen epitopes have been successfully used to induce tolerance in clinical phase 2 tests (62). A peptide vaccine targeting angiotensin II was recently developed as a novel treatment for hypertension and the prevention of heart failure (63). Applications of immunodominant-epitope-based cancer vaccines combined with other strategies have significantly enhanced the specificity and safety of T-cell responses targeting to tumors (64\u201368). HLA-restricted epitopes used to induce epitope-specific CTL responses that eliminate infected cells represent a promising vaccine strategy against dengue and influenza virus infection (69, 70). Identification of the HTNV GP epitope LL9 that can induce protective immune responses against HTNV infection in HLA-A2.1/Kb Tg mice may promote the development of a novel HTNV vaccine or related therapeutic methods for HFRS. Notably, the human kidney, as the major target organ of HTNV, is frequently injured after HTNV infection, and the injury may progress to lethal AKI (5). Higher levels of HTNV-specific CTLs have been associated with lower levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, suggesting that HTNV-specific CTLs may help reduce the risk of progression to acute renal failure caused by HTNV infection and contribute to the reduction of disease severity (71, 72). Considering the prominent protective effect of epitope LL9 in kidneys of HLA-A2.1/Kb Tg mice, which is possibly attributable to the tendentious distributions of epitope-specific CTLs (73), LL9-based vaccination may induce effective CTL responses for the prevention of kidney damage caused by HTNV infection in humans.",

The T2 cell binding assay was used to quantify the peptide-binding affinity of 34 predicted HTNV GP nonapeptides to HLA-A*0201 molecules. T2 cells incubated with each peptide and \u03b22-microglobulin were then stained with phycoerythrin-labeled HLA-A*02 monoclonal antibody and detected by flow cytometry. The orange curves indicate HLA-A*0201 stabilization with HLA-A*0201-restricted HTNV NP FA9 (aa129\u2013aa137, FVVPILLKA) peptides serving as positive controls. The red curves indicate T2 cells incubated without peptide serving as negative controls. The blue curves indicate T2 cells incubated with each HTNV GP nonapeptide. The overlay of the three conditions in histograms clearly show that the curve of T2 cells incubated with each of the eight HTNV GP nonapeptides was shifted more to the right with a higher fluorescence intensity of HLA-A*0201 molecules than those incubated without peptide, indicating that these nonapeptides have a high binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule.

The PBMCs from HLA-A*02+ HFRS patients in the acute phase of HFRS were stained with HLA-A*0201 tetramer preloaded with seven high HLA-A*0201-binding affinity peptides, respectively (including VLIEGKCFV, VMASLVWPV, SLFSLLPGV, SLTECPTFL, FLLVLESIL, LIWTGMIDL, and VIGQCIYTI). HLA-A*0201/peptide tetramer+ cells gated from CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes were considered epitope-specific CTLs.
