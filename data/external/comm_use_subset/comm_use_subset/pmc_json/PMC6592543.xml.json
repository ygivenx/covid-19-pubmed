Lesions found include necrotizing vasculitis, lymphoid necrosis, granulomatous inflammation and necrosis of intestinal crypts and Peyer\u2019s patches. Some characteristics of the disease observed in dogs (enteritis, pneumonia, lymphadenitis) were also present in pigs infected with porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), which was found to be genetically related [7].",

Additionally, coinfection with other viral pathogens, mainly canine parvovirus (CPV), but also canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, and canine influenza virus is present in CanineCV positive dogs with clinical symptoms at rates between 50 to 100% [4, 6, 8\u201311].

DNA from one of these tissues (lymph node) was randomly selected for further analysis with the remaining primer sets in order to assemble the entire CanineCV genome sequence, which was concluded to be of 2063 bp (Fig 1). PCR analysis detected the presence of CPV in all samples, except for the stomach (Fig 2A).

The complete genome of strain UBA-Baires was 2063 nt in length with a GC content of 51.5%. Genome characteristics include two putative ORFs synthesized from both DNA strands and two intergenic regions. These ORFs encode a putative viral replicase (Rep) and a capsid protein (Cap), which are 303 and 270 aa long, respectively. The 5\u2019 intergenic region, located between the start codons and encompassing 135 nt, contains a conserved stem-loop structure and a 9 nt sequence (TAGTATTAC) for initiation of rolling cycle replication. The overall nt identity of strain UBA-Baires ranged from 98% (strain Bari/411-13) to 85% (isolate UCD3-478). When compared to other CanineCV, both Rep and Cap ORFs were, as expected, highly conserved including sequences related to rolling circle replication (FTINN, TPHLQ and CSK) and dNTP binding (GCGKS) in the non-structural gene (Rep). However, four aa changes within the Cap gene and one within the Rep gene were found, which have not been previously reported for other CanineCV sequences being unique to strain UBA-Baires (Table 3). These mutations were confirmed after two independent sequencing runs directly from PCRs amplicons. No mutations were observed in the intergenic regions.",

We found only one unique mutation in the rep gene, but surprisingly, four unique aa substitutions in the Cap protein, after two independent experiments using different sequencing facilities. Very recently, nine major variable regions have been proposed to exist within the cap gene of CanineCV [12]. Only one of the four mutations present in the cap gene of strain UBA-Baires is encompassed at these proposed locations (residue 95), suggesting that, until sequences from more extent geographical areas are analyzed, these variable regions need to be taken cautiously. Point mutations in the cap gene have been described for PCV2 and are a potential source of virus evolution, especially due to selective pressure caused by vaccination [23]. In the case of CanineCV, where vaccination has not been used, the mechanisms behind these aa substitutions are unclear; virus variability under natural infection has been shown to be very complex for PCV-2 [24]. In addition, the relevance of these changes, if any, is difficult to be evaluated at this moment when it is still under investigation the role of CanineCV as a sole cause of disease [25].",

            "text": "In the case of PCV2, coinfection with other pathogens has been associated with different clinical outcomes [14]. Special attention was given to coinfection with porcine parvovirus and the syndrome could be reproduced experimentally [26, 27]. Similarly, CanineCV has been found in most cases accompanying other viral pathogens. In hemorrhagic enteritis, it is often associated to CPV, but also canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus with coinfection rates of 100% [4, 6], 70\u201380% [8, 9, 11] and 50% [10]. Only one report so far has found CanineCV as a primary agent [3]. Case-control studies carried out in different population of dogs suggest a high association between diarrhea and CanineCV, but CanineCV is still found in feces and serum from healthy dogs [8\u201311]. Nevertheless, one study showed that mortality rate was higher when CanineCV was found together with CPV [8]. Interestingly, in dogs with respiratory symptoms from Thailand, CanineCV was detected together with respiratory pathogens (canine influenza virus, canine parainfluenza virus, and canine respiratory coronavirus)[5]. In our case, all organs tested except for stomach, were also positive for CPV. Unfortunately, no histopathology was performed on these cases in order to confirm the presence of some of the lesions observed in previously described cases involving CanineCV, in particular vasculitis [25]. Surprisingly, in our case, sick animals had been vaccinated against CPV. This phenomenon was also described in a breeding colony in the USA where two severe outbreaks of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis occurred among animals vaccinated against CPV [4]. Again, the role of CanineCV in the context of vaccine efficacy against co-infecting viruses is still unclear and needs to be carefully analyzed. ISH studies carried out with clinical samples show that CanineCV infects mainly lymphoid tissues and cells [2, 5] suggesting that Infection with circovirus could cause immunosuppression and allow infection with CPV even in the case of vaccinated animals. Nevertheless, further experimental infections are necessary to elucidate the pathogenic involvement of CanineCV in disease pathogenesis.",

Phylogenetic analysis using a partial sequence from Rep revealed that the Brazilian virus seemed to be related to strains from China and the USA, among others. The tree topology is somehow different form the one we present in this study based on the full-length genome, in which the Argentinian strain grouped closer to European viruses.
