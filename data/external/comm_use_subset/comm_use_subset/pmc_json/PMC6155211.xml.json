To date, numerous autophagy-related (ATG) proteins have been characterized in yeast, many of which have known orthologs in mammals8. ATG proteins are required for virtually every step of autophagy and autophagosome biogenesis, starting with nucleation of the initial autophagosome precursor, the phagophore9. Subsequent membrane expansion, closure of the autophagosome as well as intralysosomal degradation depend on the concerted action of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, which include ATG5 and ATG710,11. Well-described marker proteins for monitoring autophagy progression are members of the LC3/GABARAP protein family12. Soluble LC3/GABARAP is constitutively processed by ATG4 proteases and, upon onset of autophagy, becomes conjugated to the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) present in autophagosomal membranes through the action of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems8,13.",

On the one hand, it is well-described that autophagy serves to adapt to stressful conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, oxidative damage or accumulation of misfolded proteins and, thus, promotes cellular survival14\u201316. On the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting a cell death-promoting role of autophagy, referred to as type II cell death or ACD17. Enforced hyperactivation of autophagy has been described to trigger massive cellular self-digestion beyond the point of allowing cellular survival18,19. Moreover, autophagosomes can serve as signaling platforms that facilitate the activation and integration of different cell death pathways, such as necroptosis, through caspase-8 activation on autophagosomal membranes20. Furthermore, selective degradation of specific proteins, like the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger catalase, can induce ACD as well21.",

Using next-generation sequencing we identified the heterozygous gain-of-function mutation ENSP00000391127:p.Arg248Trp within the TP53 gene of MZ-54 cells, which has been reported to render cells less sensitive towards apoptosis-inducing drugs27,28. We previously described the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 ATG5 KO cells derived from the MZ-54 cell line29 (Fig. 1a). Of note, the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate was found to be absent not only in ATG5 KO, but also in ATG7 KO cells (depicted by asterisk), which is in line with the notion that ATG7 is required for the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5 during autophagosome maturation30. Importantly, among the tested compounds we identified loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 to induce ATG5- and ATG7-dependent cell death in MZ-54 cells at various concentrations, as loperamide-, pimozide- or STF-62247-triggered cell death was significantly reduced in ATG5 or ATG7 KO compared to control cells (Fig. 1b\u2013d). As a positive control, we used the antidepressant drug imipramine hydrochloride (IM) in combination with the anticoagulant drug ticlopidine (TIC), since this combination has previously been reported to induce ACD in GBM cells24. As expected, treatment with IM and TIC triggered cell death in a concentration-dependent manner in parental MZ-54 cells, which was significantly decreased in ATG5 or ATG7 KO MZ-54 cells (Fig. 1e). As a negative control, treating MZ-54 cells with the apoptosis-inducing compound ABT-737 and etoposide induced cell death in WT MZ-54 cells to a similar extent as in ATG5 or ATG7 KO cells (Suppl. Fig. S1)31.",

Addition of the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk failed to protect MZ-54 cells from loperamide-, pimozide- or STF-62247-induced cell death and only partially rescued cells from IM/TIC-induced cell death, whereas it completely blocked ABT-737/etoposide-induced apoptosis used as a positive control for caspase-dependent cell death (Fig. 3a). Consistently, no caspase-3 activation was detected upon treatment with loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247 or IM/TIC in contrast to staurosporine (STS) as a positive control (Fig. 3b), indicating that loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247 and IM/TIC induced cell death largely in a caspase-independent manner. In addition, the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) failed to block cell death by loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247, or IM/TIC, whereas it efficiently blocked cell death induced by the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 (Fig. 3c) that was used as a positive control for ferroptosis32. Similarly, addition of the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)1 inhibitor necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s) failed to block cell death induced by loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247 or IM/TIC, whereas Nec-1s profoundly protected HT-29 colon carcinoma cells from cell death induced by a combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, the Smac mimetic BV6 and zVAD.fmk (Fig. 3d), a well-described model of necroptosis33.

It inhibits this pathway by phosphorylating few ATG proteins35. mTORC1 itself can be activated through phosphorylation at Ser2446 by protein kinase B (PKB), which leads to inhibition of autophagy36,37. Since this phosphorylation site acts as a switch controlling the activity and function of mTORC1, we investigated whether loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce dephosphorylation of mTORC1 at Ser2446, as this would allow for activation of autophagy37. Indeed, loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247, and IM/TIC markedly reduced phosphorylation of mTORC1, similar to the well-described autophagy inducer rapamycin38 (Fig. 4). In addition, we assessed the phosphorylation status of ribosomal protein S6 kinase I (S6K), one of the downstream targets of mTORC139. In line with the observed dephosphorylation of mTORC1, all compounds caused dephosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 4). Since rapamycin has been reported to induce autophagy by preventing phosphorylation of mTORC1 at Ser244634, we tested whether this drug could also induce autophagy-dependent cell death. Rapamycin, however, did not induce cell death in MZ-54 cells (Suppl. Fig. S4 A-C) at a concentration that inhibited phosphorylation of mTORC1 and S6K (Fig. 4). Together, this set of experiments indicates that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 negatively regulate mTORC1, which in turn may lead to increased autophagy.",

In contrast to the untreated control, treatment with IM/TIC, loperamide or pimozide induced massive formation of heteromorphous degradative compartments (DGC), which include lysosomes, amphisomes (i.e. autophagosomes fused with endosomes) and autolysosomes (Fig. 6a\u2013e). In most cases, these DGC contained electron-dense material that likely reflects the presence of cytoplasmic material being degraded. In addition, we also observed a significant increase in autophagosomes per cell section upon treatment with IM/TIC, loperamide and pimozide (Fig. 6b, c, e). Notably, the increase of DGC was shown to be more pronounced than the increase in autophagosomes, pointing to a rapid fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes that is indicative of an enhanced autophagic flux. Together, this ultrastructural analysis highlights that treatment with IM/TIC, loperamide and pimozide triggers morphological hallmarks of autophagy.",

This system is based on the expression of the GFP-LC3B-RFP-LC3B\u0394G fusion protein, composed of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to WT LC3B and red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to the LC3B Gly120 mutant (Fig. 7b). Upon ectopic expression, this fusion protein is intracellularly cleaved by the ATG4 proteases into equimolar ratios (Fig. 7b). GFP-LC3B localizes to autophagosomes and eventually becomes partly degraded in autolysosomes upon induction of autophagy. However, the mutated RFP-LC3B\u0394G cannot be conjugated to autophagosomes and remains cytosolic without being turned over by autophagy, thus serving as internal control (Fig. 7b). We therefore assessed GFP and RFP protein levels by Western blotting upon the induction of autophagy by loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247. Importantly, all three compounds led to a decrease of GFP protein levels, whereas RFP levels remained stable (Fig. 7c). In contrast, both GFP and RFP levels remained stable upon compound treatment of ATG7 KO cells (Fig. 7c).",

Second, we demonstrated that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induced an increase in the autophagic flux of MZ-54 cells that was potentiated by inhibition of lysosomal maturation and reduced by loss of ATG5 or ATG7 expression. Third, loperamide- and pimozide-treated MZ-54 cells were characterized by distinct and prominent ultrastructural hallmarks of autophagy, which are generally considered as a gold standard for the analysis of autophagy23. Fourth, we demonstrated that cell death induced by loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 was not primarily mediated via apoptosis, necroptosis or ferroptosis, as typical pharmacological inhibitors of these cell death modalities largely failed to prevent cell death.

Pimozide is an FDA-approved diphenylbutylpiperidine that targets D2 dopaminergic receptors58.

            "text": "In several studies, Ca2+ channel antagonists have been associated with autophagy regulation; however, their exact effects on autophagy are still being controversially discussed62. For instance, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ has been shown to inhibit mTORC1 signaling through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CAMKK2/CaMKK\u03b2) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to accumulation of autophagosomes63. On the other hand, an inhibitory role of enhanced intracellular Ca2+ levels on autophagy has been reported as well. Increases in Ca2+ activate calpains and adenylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of 3\u2032-5\u2032-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)64. cAMP stimulates inositol triphosphate (IP3) production that activates inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (ITPRs) on the ER membranes to secrete Ca2+, resulting in autophagy inhibition by maintaining enhanced mTORC1 activity65. Moreover, Ca2+ release from the ER and the subsequent decrease in intra-ER Ca2+ levels were shown to promote misfolding of the lysosomal proton pump vATPase, leading to impaired lysosomal acidification and autophagy66,67. According to this scenario, inhibition of Ca2+ channels through loperamide and pimozide may enhance autophagy indirectly through a release from autophagy inhibition. Interestingly, apart from enhancing autophagy through lowering IP3 levels, inhibition of voltage-gated channels has also been shown to induce autophagy through inhibition of calpain-mediated cleavage of ATG568.",

Indeed, our present study shows that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induced a strong accumulation of LC3B-positive autophagosomes and autolysosomes prior to cell death over a period of 48 h, hence supporting the hypothesis of a threshold effect which possibly turns autophagy into a detrimental process.
