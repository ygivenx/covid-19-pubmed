            "text": "Overlapping gene pairs are found in many viruses and organisms1\u20135. In higher organisms, the overlapping regions usually involve introns, 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-untranslated regions, or very short protein coding segments. Few examples of long, overlapping, protein coding segments have been described in bacteria, yeast, or mitochondria1,2,6. Thus, a survey of prokaryotic genomes found just six pairs of genes with overlaps of 30 amino acids or more1. Only in viruses is it common to find protein coding segments that overlap extensively. Indeed, coding two proteins on one stretch of DNA severely limits the coding possibilities. If the proteins are coded on the same strand in different reading frames, each nucleotide is part of two overlapping codons; if they are coded on opposite strands, the codons used for each protein must base pair. These constraints affect the rate of genetic drift, limit the ability to become optimally adapted, and presumably explain the counterselection of such sequences.",

In viruses, it is presumably a response to selective pressure for a reduced genome size, compatible with a fixed capsid volume. It also leads to constraints on protein regulation and expression. Indeed, two proteins coded on opposite strands would be hard to transcribe at the same time because of collisions between the two polymerases, and the transcript of one would be able to base pair with the transcript of the other to form double-stranded RNA. It may be that the few observed bacterial, yeast, and mitochondrial instances have survived because of such specific regulatory properties1,2,4,6.",

            "text": "It has also been proposed that new genes could appear through a scenario where an alternate reading frame within an existing gene acquires the ability to be transcribed and translated into a polypeptide, which could eventually become functional1,7,8. Later, gene duplication would create a second copy of the overlapping pair, and within each copy, one of the genes would become defunct. In particular, viruses are thought to use alternate reading frames, either on the antisense or the sense strand, to generate new genes9, a mechanism known as \u201coverprinting\u201d10. A special case of transient dual genes could be when horizontal transfer of an overlapping gene pair occurs from a virus to a cellular organism. The hypothesis of spontaneous antisense gene appearance has found support in the structure of the genetic code11. It has been pointed out that with both the usual and the mitochondrial genetic codes, the nucleotide triplets that encode polar (respectively, nonpolar) amino acids are complementary to antisense triplets that encode nonpolar (polar) amino acids. In addition, the secondary structure preferences of the sense/antisense amino acids are similar. This complementarity could facilitate the folding and gain of function of a hypothetical antisense polypeptide. A special case of this hypothesis is that peptide ligands might have arisen for some proteins from the antisense strand complementary to their coding region11,12.",

In particular, a synthetic organism where several genes overlap would have fewer available neutral mutations, since each mutation in the overlapping region would affect more than one protein. Thus, the organism would undergo reduced genetic drift and remain closer to its original, designed genotype. An example of a designed overlapping gene was produced recently, where each DNA strand coded for a simplified but functional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase \u201cUrzyme\u201d13\u201316, with the two enzymes being homologous to the two modern synthetase classes.",

Indeed, to evaluate their role in evolution, we should have a precise idea of the difficulty to create them. The rarity of contemporary examples and the stringent overlap constraints suggest that it is very difficult. To quantify in a general way the difficulty to create overlapping genes, we have examined the possibility of encoding an arbitrary pair of protein domains in a single DNA segment, as a fully-overlapping dual gene. We considered three possible reading frames for the second protein, relative to the first: two on the antisense strand and one on the sense strand. Indeed, sense and antisense overlap schemes have different implications for the biological hypotheses above and different capabilities to code a variety of amino acid types11,17. One sense:antisense overlap scheme placed the third, wobble base in each codon opposite the central nucleotide of another codon (Fig. 1). Given the structure of the genetic code, this is expected to be the most favorable scheme, as confirmed below. Another scheme placed the central bases of the sense and antisense codons opposite each other (F = 0 scheme, Fig. 1). This is less favorable, since each central base constrains the other. The two sense:sense overlap schemes are similar and we chose one of them.\n",

For each (X, Y) pair, we searched for two homologs (X\u2032, Y\u2032) that can be encoded in a fully overlapping manner. We required that the coding sequence of the smaller domain be completely embedded within that of the larger one. For each pair, we explored three possible overlap schemes, where X\u2032 and Y\u2032 are encoded either on the same DNA strand in two different reading frames or on opposite strands. The search used a dynamic programming scheme19, presented here, that provably maximizes a total X/X\u2032 and Y/Y\u2032 similarity score. The method\u2019s cost is proportional to the length of the shorter protein, allowing a large-scale study. Considering all three reading frames, we found that over 16% of the (X, Y) pairs have homologous pairs (X\u2032, Y\u2032) that can be encoded in a fully overlapping manner, with a level of X/X\u2032 and Y/Y\u2032 homology corresponding to Blast E-values of 10\u221210 or less and a match length of at least 85% of the total sequence length. The success rate was 14% for pairs of non-viral proteins and 52% for pairs of viral proteins. None of the 502 viral pairs were natural pairs occurring within the same virus. Thus, it appears that many pairs of protein domains have close homologs that can be encoded by a fully-overlapping dual gene and the tendency is especially high for viral proteins. This is in striking contrast to naive expectation. Differences between the proteins that do or do not allow overlapping schemes are analyzed and discussed.",

It has also been proposed that triple overlaps may have existed in ancestral ribosome sequences22.

Statistical evidence for such an ancestral dual gene was found by analyzing the DNA sequences of modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases32. A hypothetical dual gene that exhibits a weak similarity to both synthetase classes was discovered in the mold Achlya klebsiana and several other organisms33,34. The recent design of two overlapping synthetase genes13\u201316 also provides some support for this hypothesis.",

This could be of technological interest, for example to produce a very compact plasmid or to prevent the fixation of mutations and genetic drift in a plasmid or a synthetic organism. Given the surprising ease with which a dual gene can be designed, we also considered and verified the possibility of creating 200 triple genes that use not two, but three of the six possible overlapping reading frames. With additional effort, other triple genes with even better E-values could be obtained. This could be a way to reduce genetic drift even more drastically, constraining an artifical organism to stay close to its original genotype.",
