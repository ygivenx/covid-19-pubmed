Interactions between Tregs and non-Tregs result in modifications of the function of both cell types, with the goal of minimizing detrimental side effects of pro-inflammatory immune responses while maximizing the efficacy of processes such as pathogen clearance. Further, the function of both cell types and the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses may be affected by cytokines and other molecules produced by cells such as dendritic cells, in the inflammatory milieu.",

Thus, Tregs express T-bet and IRF4 at sites of Th1 and Th2 inflammation, respectively [5]\u2013[7]. Additionally, we and others have shown that Foxp3+ Tregs express IFN-\u03b3 during infections [5], [8]. Unfractionated populations of Tregs harvested from inflammatory sites, which include cells expressing IFN-\u03b3, remain immunosuppressive. Suppression can be demonstrated in T cell proliferation assays after stimulation with either anti-CD3 mAb or virus-specific peptides [8]. In contrast, other studies suggest that a pro-inflammatory milieu may result in diminished Treg suppressive function [9]\u2013[11]. In a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CNS-derived epitope MOG35\u201355-specific Tregs showed reduced ability to inhibit proliferation of Tconv of the same specificity isolated from the inflamed CNS [9]. This reduction in inhibitory function was IL-6 and TNF-dependent.",

In other studies, IL-12 was shown to induce IFN-\u03b3 production by Tregs in vitro and in vivo\n[5], [13]; IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tregs may indicate that these cells are transiting to Th1 effector cells [13]. Thus, in apparent conflict with the results using suppression assays, these data suggest that IFN-\u03b3 expression is a marker for reduced immunosuppressive ability. However whether IFN-\u03b3 expression actually affects Treg suppressive function has not been assessed experimentally. Collectively these results suggest that IL-12 has independent effects on Tconv and CD8 T cells as opposed to Tregs. Consequently, the effect of IL-12 (or other cytokines) on the T cell response in a total lymphocyte culture will reflect the summation of effects on the different cell types.",

Treatment with IL-12 induced IFN-\u03b3 expression by both Tconv and Tregs and reduced Treg frequency and Foxp3 expression. We also demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3+ Tregs are as immunosuppressive as IFN-\u03b3- Tregs. Our results showed that IL-12 functioned, in part, by diminishing IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells in the mixed cultures and by down-regulating IL-2 receptor expression on Tregs but up-regulating it on non-Treg T cells.",

To address this question, we treated spleen and lymph node-derived lymphocytes isolated from Foxp3gfp mice with anti-CD3 mAb in the presence or absence of IL-12. GFP+ Tregs were then sorted from the mixed cultures.

We observed diminished suppression of CFSE-labeled CD4 T cells in the presence of IL-12, in agreement with published results (Fig. 5).

            "text": "Treg development, homeostasis and suppressive function are dependent upon IL-2 [25]\u2013[29]. Further, IL-12 diminishes IL-2 expression by CD4 T cells [30]. Initially, we showed that IL-2 expression by Tconvs was modestly reduced after 48 hr with more substantial effects noted after 72 hr of IL-12 treatment (Fig. 8A). More strikingly, IL-2 production by CD8 T cells was greatly reduced after both 48 and 72 hr (Fig. 8A). In agreement with this diminished expression, levels of IL-2, measured by ELISA, were reduced in IL-12-treated cultures at 48 hr (Fig. 8B). T cell proliferation is augmented by IL-2, especially in tissues at sites of inflammation [31]\u2013[33], yet the results in Fig. 1 show that Tconv proliferation is increased by IL-12 treatment. One possible explanation for these results is that IL-12 preferentially induces IL-2R expression on Tconvs; IL-12 was previously shown to enhance IL-2R expression on CD8 T cells [34]. As shown in Fig. 9 (A\u2013B, D\u2013E), this is indeed the case. Treatment with IL-12 in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb induced up-regulation of both the \u03b1 (CD25) and \u03b2 (CD122) chains of the IL-2R on Tconv and CD8 T cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, IL-12 treatment diminished CD25 expression on Tregs while not affecting CD122 expression, reducing the ability of Tregs to compete for IL-2 in the culture. Of note, even though IL-12 induced increased IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells, IFN-\u03b3, by itself, was unable to induce diminished expression of IL-2 (Fig. 8B) or IL-2R upregulation on non-Treg T cells (Fig. 9C).",

Similarly to IL-12, IL-27 diminished IL-2 production by Tconvs and CD8 T cells (Fig. 10A) and down-regulated Foxp3 expression by Tregs (Fig. 10B). However, unlike IL-12, IL-27 decreased proliferation of Tconvs and Tregs and had no effect on CD8 T cell expansion (Fig. 10C, D) resulting in a relatively slight decrease in Treg frequency (Fig. 10E). The effects of IL-12 were mediated both by diminished IL-2 expression and changes in the relative amounts of IL-2R on Tregs and Tconvs and CD8 T cells. IL-27 reduced CD25 and CD122 expression on Tregs but only marginally affected expression on non-Tregs (Fig. 10F). Collectively, these results suggest that Tregs are better able to compete for IL-2 in IL-27 compared to IL-12-treated cultures.",

Here, we extend these observations to analyze the effects of IL-12 on T cells in unfractionated lymphoid cultures and identify a basis for at least some of the effects of IL-12. We show that IL-12 decreases IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells and differentially modulates IL-2R expression on Tregs and non-Tregs. IL-2R is up-regulated on Tconv and CD8 T cells and down-regulated on Tregs. When coupled with decreased IL-2 production, this results in a milieu that favors non-Treg proliferation. The effect of IL-12 on CD25 expression by CD8 T cells is especially notable. In the absence of IL-12, levels of CD25 are much greater on Tregs than CD8 T cells, but treatment with IL-12 at 1 ng/ml results in levels of CD25 on CD8 T cells that exceed those on Tregs in the same culture (Fig. 8B, C). Levels on CD8 T cells are substantially higher than those on Tconv cells, explaining why IL-12 more readily relieves Treg-mediated suppression of CD8 T cell proliferation. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that IL-2R is down-regulated on Tregs in inflamed tissues in the setting of infectious or autoimmune diseases and that IL-2 levels are reduced at these sites, resulting in the outgrowth of non-Treg T cells [5], [36], [37].",

            "text": "Another consequence of IL-12 treatment is the induction of IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tregs. Tregs express IFN-\u03b3 at sites of inflammation under conditions of Th1-type lethal and non-lethal infections [5], [8]. It has been difficult to determine whether IFN-\u03b3 affects Treg suppressive function, since Tregs in these settings include both IFN-\u03b3+ and IFN-\u03b3- cells. Here we showed that IFN-\u03b3 expression did not diminish Treg suppressive function. These results are in agreement with others showing that in vitro-generated IFN-\u03b3+ and IFN-\u03b3- Tregs were equally suppressive in a mouse model of colitis [13]. In other experimental settings, loss of Foxp3 and gain of inflammatory cytokine expression suggested that Tregs converted into effector T cells [22], [47]. If Tregs at sites of inflammation can generally express IFN-\u03b3 and still remain suppressive, these results raise the possibility that IFN-\u03b3+ Tregs, instead of entering the effector T cell pool, could lose IFN-\u03b3 and revert to a classic Treg phenotype. Whether these cells would preferentially re-express IFN-\u03b3 on repeat exposure to antigen remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Several studies including this one demonstrate an important role for IL-12 in IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells and Tregs in vitro\n[5], [13]. Further, IL-12 is critical for IFN-\u03b3 production by Tregs in mice with autoimmune colitis [13]. However, the requirement for IL-12 in IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells or Tregs in virus-infected animals is less clear. To investigate whether IL-12 signaling is critical for IFN-\u03b3 production by Tregs in virus-infected mice, we infected IL-12R\u03b22\u2212/\u2212 mice with the mildly neurovirulent rJ2.2 strain of MHV [48]. We detected slightly lower frequencies of virus-specific IFN-\u03b3 expressing Tregs and Tconv in IL-12R\u03b22\u2212/\u2212 mice, consistent with a previous report showing that IL-12 modestly decreased the frequencies of virus-specific T cells in MHV-infected IL-12p35\u2212/\u2212 mice [49]. The absence of IL-12 signalling may not have had a substantial effect because we detected no differences in CD25 expression on Tregs and virus-specific non-Treg T cells when cells harvested from the brains of IL-12R\u03b22\u2212/\u2212 mice and B6 mice were compared (data not shown). Our results are also consistent with others showing IFN-\u03b3 production was relatively normal in IL-12\u2212/\u2212 or IL-12R\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, influenza A virus, adenovirus or hepatotropic strains of MHV. In contrast, IL-12 was essential for IFN-\u03b3 expression in mice infected with some intracellular non-viral pathogens, such as Leishmania species and Toxoplasma gondii [50].",
