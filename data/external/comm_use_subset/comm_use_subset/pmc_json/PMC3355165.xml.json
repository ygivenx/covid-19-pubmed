            "text": "The use of an adjuvant is a key element in promoting vaccine effectiveness because it can stimulate the immune system and accelerate, prolong, or enhance antigen-specific immune responses, even when used in combination with weak vaccine antigens [1]. Adjuvants have been used in vaccines since the early 20th Century following more than 100 years of research. In the U.S., Alum remains the sole FDA-approved adjuvant for general use of vaccines [2]. However, few adjuvants have been licensed for use around the world [3]. No new adjuvants have been approved in the United States since the 1930s, and only recently has the European Heads of Medicines Agencies licensed the MF59, AS03 and AS04 adjuvants for use with the Fluad\u00ae, Fendrix\u2122 and Cervarix\u2122 defined vaccines, respectively [4]. Cervarix\u2122 which uses AS04, a combination of aluminum hydroxide and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), in its formulation was also licensed by FDA on October 16, 2009, to prevent cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus types 16 and 18. Adjuvants are important in guiding the type of adaptive response that is induced after vaccination and that is most effective against incoming infections. The development of novel adjuvants that stimulate discrete subsets of immune cells, in particular, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), is required to unleash the full potential of new vaccines and immunotherapy strategies [5]. Although tremendous progress has been made in the development of many vaccine platforms, including DNA-based vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, viruses and conjugates, the absence of safe and effective adjuvants impedes the clinical development of such new generations of vaccines. Interest in developing new adjuvants has increased significantly over the past decade, as highlighted by the following issues [6], [7]: 1) the inability of traditional approaches to develop successful vaccines against \u201cdifficult\u201d organisms such as HIV and HCV; 2) the emergence of epidemics or outbreaks of new infectious diseases with high mortality, especially those causing serious threats to public health and socioeconomic stability worldwide (e.g., SARS, Ebola, West Nile, Dengue, pandemic flu and nvCJD); 3) the re-emergence of \u201cold\u201d infections like tuberculosis; 4) the continuing spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria; and 5) the increased threat of bioterrorism. Therefore, the molecular design of potently adjuvanted vaccines that would enhance antigen uptake in vivo and potentially also simplify their adjuvant requirements would be highly desirable [8].",

            "text": "There are many reports showing that helminth-derived molecules have potent regulatory or stimulatory effects on the immune system of their mammalian hosts (reviewed in [9], [10]\u2013[21]). Some of these molecules were shown to contain pathogen associated molecular pattern that bind to endocytic-pattern recognition receptors on antigen presenting cells (APCs). Three helminth products have also been reported to act as adjuvants in experimental vaccine models. Proteins secreted by adult Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (NES) induced strong Th2 responses in mice immunized with hen egg lysozyme [22]. NES actively matured dendritic cells (DC) and selectively up-regulated CD86 and OX40L, together with IL-6 production, while blocking IL-12p70 responsiveness in a manner consistent with Th2 generation in vivo\n[23]. Similarly, lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII), a carbohydrate found on the surface of the eggs of a human parasite, Schistosoma mansoni, acted as a Th2 adjuvant for human serum albumin when injected intranasally, subcutaneously or intraperitonealy into mice [24]. It functions as an innate Th2 promoter via its action on murine DCs. Its ability to drive DC2 maturation was shown to be dependent on signaling via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [25]. Finally, when co-administered with an inactivated anti-influenza vaccine in both young and aged mice, a 19 aa synthetic peptide (GK-1) from Taenia crassiceps cysticerci has induced increased levels of anti-influenza antibodies in aged mice, both before and after infection, reduced the local inflammation that accompanied influenza vaccination itself, and favored virus clearance after infection in both young and aged mice [26].",

            "text": "A recombinant Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated protein-1, rOv-ASP-1, has been shown to be a novel protein adjuvant that can increase specific immune responses in mice, both humoral and cellular responses, against recombinant protein or peptide-based antigens when formulated in aqueous mixtures [14], [27], [28], [29]. We have previously suggested that these effects are probably attained through the cellular activation of APCs such as dendritic cells via TLR-2 and TLR-4 [27]. The rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant is able to induce balanced Th2 and Th1-associated IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies to proteins, polypeptides and small peptides. With a few antigens such as rgp41, RBD and HBsAg, it also promoted a putative Th1-biased response based on pronounced induction of Th1-associated IgG2a and IgG2b antibody responses and/or a significantly upregulated production of Th1 cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 [14], [27], [29], [30] . Its ability to augment Th1-associated antibody responses was further demonstrated in studies using three commercial inactivated vaccines against hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, flu and Rabies [29]. Moreover, in a novel recombinant configuration, rOv-ASP-1 fused to 3 copies of the highly conserved extracellular domain of the H5N1 influenza M2 protein sequence was able to induce high levels of M2e-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a providing strong cross-protection from a lethal challenge with 3LD50 or 10 LD50 of H5N1 viruses of different clades (clade 1: VN/1194, or clade 2.3.4: SZ/406H [28]. In this study, we further demonstrated the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 in sequential vaccines in mice and also confirmed its ability to be a potent innate adjuvant in NHPs.",

            "text": "To evaluate the adjuvant activity of rOv-ASP-1, mice were immunized with SARS-CoV rRBD in the presence or absence of rOv-ASP-1 or with Alum or CpG for comparison. We previously reported that rOv-ASP-1 could effectively induce a mixed, but Th1-skewed immune response against rS and rRBD in immunized mice [27]. As shown in Figure 1, the titers of RBD-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies increase after the first or second boost immunization in the sera of mice immunized with rRBD plus rOv-ASP-1, which were all significantly higher than in mice immunized with rRBD alone. The IgG and IgG2a responses in mice vaccinated with rRBD in the presence of Alum were significantly higher only after the second boost; only the IgG1 response was significantly higher after the first boost. The anti-rRBD IgG response was significantly higher in the presence of CpG only after the second boost when compared to mice vaccinated only with rRBD (1\u2236102,400 vs. 1\u223611,314). Notably, the rOv-ASP-1 augmented IgG antibody response to rRBD was almost 4 times higher than the Alum vaccination group (64,000 vs. 16,000) and 5.7 times higher than the CpG vaccination group (64,000 vs. 11,200) already after the first boost. Further comparison of the rOv-ASP-1 and the Alum induced rRBD antibody responses after the second boost revealed similar levels of IgG1 (1,884,544 vs. 1,722,156); two-fold higher level of IgG2a (935,763 vs. 512,000) as well as ten times higher level of IgG2b (430,538 vs. 45,255) endpoint titers in the rOv-ASP-1 vaccine group. Comparison of the rOv-ASP-1 and the CpG induced rRBD antibody responses after the second boost revealed a 27 fold increase in IgG1 (1,884,544 vs. 68,000), 14.6 fold increase in IgG2a (935,763 vs. 64,000), and 215 fold increase in IgG2b (430,538 vs. 2,000) endpoint titers. Each adjuvant/rRBD model performed differently depending on the adjuvant, e.g., a skewed Th2 response with Alum (IgG1/IgG2a = 3.3), but a mixed Th1/Th2 response with CpG (IgG2a/IgG1 = 0.94) and rOv-ASP-1(IgG2a/IgG1 = 2), with a predominance of Th1-associated antibodies (when both IgG2a and IgG2b are taken into account) with rOv-ASP-1. These results further supported our previous studies showing that rOv-ASP-1 can induce a more balanced antibody response with some bias towards a skewed Th1-associated antibody response than other adjuvants used with the same bystander antigen such as Alum or CpG (this study) or the MLP plus TDM adjuvant [14], [27], [29].",

In this study, the data from the CBA analyses showed that the levels of Th1- and Th2-type cytokine secretion were significantly higher in mice immunized with rRBD+rOv-ASP-1 or Alum than in those who were immunized with rRBD alone (Table 1). The rOv-ASP-1 induced the production of Type I proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A and IL-6) to the same extent as Alum, as well as the Th2/regulatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. There was no significant recall induction of the Th2 IL-4 or IL-5 cytokines by rRBD (data not shown). Notably, the responses to rRBD when formulated with CpG are in comparison more IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A dominant with diminished IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and IL-6 responses. We found that the variation between individual mice was very low [31], [32], and therefore we are confident that the results obtained using the pooled spleens are a good representation of what would have been the outcome if we had used individual mice.",

As shown in Table 2, similar IgG1 and IgG2a humoral immune responses against the influenza viruses were induced in the mice vaccinated previously with rRBD plus rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant and those administered with PBS only. Moreover, the IgG2b was higher in the group that got the sequential vaccine (162,000 vs. 54,000). The anti-HA IgG1 and IgG2b antibody responses were much higher in mice that were immunized with the HAs vaccine in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant than those immunized in the absence of rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant (IgG1: 1,458,000 vs. 607,000 or 729,000; IgG2b: 243,000 vs. 162,000 or 54,000).

            "text": "Adjuvants can be broadly separated into two classes based on their principal mechanism of action: vaccine delivery systems and immunostimulation. Vaccine delivery systems are generally particulate and function mainly to target associated antigens into APCs, e.g., emulsions, microparticles, iscoms, and liposomes [6], [39]. Immunostimulatory adjuvants contain residues that are recognized by receptors on APCs, such as TLRs, which play an important role in the innate recognition of pathogens by DCs, and thus directly activate innate immune responses. These adjuvants are now regarded as the most effective means by which an adjuvant-antigen complex can target APCs [40]. Adjuvants targeting multiple innate immune receptors may prove to be the most effective adjuvants, as they may induce different arms of the immune responses in the host. A number of microbial products, including bacterial LPS, peptidoglycan, dsRNA, muramyl peptides, CpG, flagellin and microbial proteins, were shown to act as vaccine adjuvants [41]\u2013[45]. Some of these immunomodulators could skew acquired immune responses towards a Th1-type immune response. Adjuvants can also be classified according to their capacity to stimulate either innate or adaptive immunity based on significant differences in their cellular receptors and mechanisms of action [46]. As previously noted, Alum is the only adjuvant licensed in the U.S. for general use in humans. Yet, Alum is not effective in stimulating Th1 and/or cytotoxic T cell responses to a number of pathogens and is therefore limited in its applications, in particular for new-generation vaccines [47]. Some of the adjuvants being developed in clinical testing include MPL, the saponin derivative QS-21, CpG, flagellin, and combinations of some of these adjuvants [40]\u2013[51].",

This has led to additional research for alternative adjuvants or adjuvant combinations that promote balanced mixed Th1/Th2 responses. The present study clearly demonstrated that rOv-ASP-1 could effectively induce mixed RBD- or HA-specific Th1/Th2 antibody associated responses, when used as an adjuvant with recombinant subunit vaccine or as an addition to a commercial Flu vaccine (FLUVIRIN; using 20% of the dose recommended for human use).",

Therefore, concerns might be raised whether preexisting anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibodies may suppress its adjuvanticity when it is used in subsequent vaccine formulations. Previously we demonstrated that antibody response to the adjuvant itself did not hindered the development of OVA, rS or rRBD antigen-specific antibody responses after each boost; in all cases the responses in the presence of rOv-ASP-1 were more elevated than those in the presence of MPL+TMP or Alum adjuvants. Our present results further confirmed that antibodies induced against the adjuvant had no impact on its ability to induce immune responses against bystander antigens when used as an adjuvant in a sequential vaccine when two vaccine model systems were used: the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein and a commercial influenza virus HA vaccine comprised of three virus strains. Even though a high level of anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibodies (1\u2236256,000\u20131\u2236512,000) was present in the sera of mice before the administration of the second vaccine, the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 was retained with efficacy similar to that obtained when it was used as an adjuvant in a first vaccine immunization of na\u00efve mice (Table 2 and Figure 3); no difference in the IgG titers was observed between the two vaccine groups, mice pre-immunized with rRBD+rOv-ASP-1 or PBS. Thus, we confirmed that the preexisting anti-rOv-ASP-1 antibodies induced by a previously administrated rOv-ASP-1-based vaccine do not have a significant effect on the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 when formulated in a subsequent vaccine. Notably, immunization of NHPs with rOv-ASP-1 did not induce high titers of anti-self-antibodies, for reasons that are not yet clear. Future studies will be needed to further validate that even these reasonably low antibody responses to the adjuvant have no impact on subsequent use of this adjuvant with other vaccines also in NHPs.",

Firstly, no adverse reactions were observed at the site of the immunizations, indicating the safety of rOv-ASP-1 as an adjuvant. Secondly, using two concentration of the rOv-ASP-1 adjuvant, 50 or 100 \u00b5g, and rRBD as the vaccine antigen, we were able to induce after three immunizations high titers of neutralizing antibodies (1\u22363,500\u20131\u22366,392) that much exceed what is needed for protection against SARS-CoV infection in vivo (>1\u2236500) [56]. Moreover, our studies have shown that rOv-ASP-1 was able to support the induction of functional antibodies against a pathogen in NHPs, thus clearing the way for its future development for human vaccines as well. Thus, this pilot NHP study is a definitive step for demonstrating relevance of rOv-ASP-1 for human vaccine formulations, even though more studies will be needed to find the optimized amount of the adjuvant in vaccine formulations, which will specify the putative starting adjuvant dose for future clinical trials of rOv-ASP-1-based vaccines. Interestingly, we did not see augmented recall RBD specific cellular responses except TNF-\u00e1. Therefore, future studies will be needed to validate the adjuvanticity of rOv-ASP-1 in primates from the point of its ability to augment the desired types of cellular responses are associated with protective immunity against possibly other pathogens, duration of immunity and the potential to establish T cell memory. In summary, the present studies have advanced our confidence that the rOv-ASP-1 protein adjuvant can be further developed for human use, particularly when strong functional balanced antibody responses are needed against the pathogens.",

Subsequently, the antisera-virus mixtures were added to 293T cells expressing the SARS receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (293T/ACE2) in 96-well plates, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 48 h, followed by lysing the infected cells using cell lysis buffer included in the luciferase kit (Promega). Aliquots of cell lysates were transferred to 96-well Costar flat-bottom luminometer plates (Corning Costar), followed by addition of luciferase substrate (Promega). Relative light units were determined immediately in the Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan). The neutralization of SARS pseudovirus is presented as 50% neutralizing antibody titer (NT50) [60].",
