NADPH plays an important role in maintaining the supply of reduced glutathione to counterbalance oxidant-induced oxidative stress [1]. Redox imbalance may induce cell apoptosis and necrosis, thus highlighting the role of G6PD in defending against oxidative damage [2,3]. G6PD deficiency is the most prevalent enzyme defect in humans and affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, especially in populations historically exposed to endemic malaria [4]. The most common clinical manifestations are neonatal jaundice and acute hemolytic anemia, which is caused by the impairment of the erythrocyte\u2019s ability to remove harmful oxidative stress triggered by exogenous agents such as drugs, infection, or fava bean ingestion [1,4].

Most studies have focused on investigating the antibiotic-induced hemolysis after treatment for bacterial infection [7]. In addition, a case report showed that infection by Clostridium difficile may have triggered hemolysis and led to severe jaundice in a G6PD-deficient neonate, while another case report described hemolysis caused by Acinetobacter baumannii infection [13,14]. Wilmanski and colleagues demonstrated that hyperinflammation (increasing cytokine levels) caused by acute endotoxemia (induced by the injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide) resulted in increased mortality in G6PD-deficient mice [15]. Several studies also indicated that G6PD deficiency in leukocytes can result in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and possibly alter the host defense mechanisms for bacterial infections [16\u201318]. Thus far, the impact of bacterial infection on patients with G6PD deficiency has been found to primarily affect the blood cells, leading to hemolysis or immune weakness based upon the above studies.",

Therefore, we propose that cells with G6PD deficiency may be less tolerant to the oxidative stress caused by bacterial infection. In the present study, we investigate the direct impact of bacterial infection on G6PD-deficient epithelial cells using Staphylococcus aureus as a model pathogen. S. aureus, which has long been recognized as a major cause of healthcare-associated infections, can result in sepsis and septic shock leading to vascular damage and multiple organ failure. Vancomycin is one of the primary choices to treat infections resulting from multidrug-resistant S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Our previous study demonstrated that the vancomycin-treated vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) strain did enhance cytotoxicity through the activation of \u03c3B and alternation of virulence expression [22]. Whether such enhancement is even stronger in G6PD-deficient cells was also investigated in this study. ",

The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that a similar level of the cleaved caspase-8 (33 and 10 kDa) was observed upon VRSA/vancomycin-treated VRSA infection in both A549-5S-5 and A549-5.20 cells, suggesting a similar signal strength to trigger the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. A weak cleaved caspase-8 expression was found in bacteria-free A549-5.20 cells, implying that the G6PD-deficient cells were less tolerant to extrinsic death ligands during culture. On the other hand, VRSA infection obviously triggered higher expression of the precursor (37 kDa) and cleaved forms (22 and 10 kDa) of caspase-9, thereafter leading to higher expression levels of pro-caspase-3 (35 kDa) and cleaved caspase-3 (20 and 11 kDa), which is the effector caspase, in A549-5.20 cells than in scrambled control cells (Figure 4). The above results suggest that a stronger intrinsically apoptotic signal was triggered in G6PD-deficient cells upon bacterial infection. In addition, vancomycin treatment of VRSA-infected cells reduced the expression levels of cleaved caspase-9 and -3 in both cell lines (Figure 4). Trace or non expression of caspase-9 and -3 was observed in bacteria-free cell cultures. ",

As described, the effect of infection on patients with G6PD deficiency was studied mainly with regard to hemolytic anemia caused by Plasmodium infection, antimicrobial drugs, and viral and bacterial infections. In addition to hemolytic anemia, the enhancement of both viral infection and immune weakness (such as neutrophil dysfunction) were also addressed.

Such phagocyte dysfunction may lead to recurrent infections by catalase-positive microorganisms (such as staphylococci) because those bacteria could be phagocytosed but not digested [29]. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that bacterial infection may induce oxidative stress in lymphocytes, in mammary epithelial cells, or in yeast [30\u201332]. Consistent with the above findings, our results indicated that intracellular ROS were generated in A549 lung carcinoma cells upon S. aureus infection (Figure 2). We further propose that the capacity for ROS removal is impaired in G6PD-deficient cells following infection-induced oxidative stress. As expected, the accumulation of ROS was significantly higher in G6PD-deficient cells than in control scramble cells following exposure to VRSA (Figure 2). Therefore, the impact of bacterial infection on patients with G6PD deficiency is two-fold. First is the immune weakness due to the dysfunction of phagocytes. Second is the impairment of ROS removal upon bacterial infection, as we have demonstrated in epithelial cells. ",

            "text": "It has been well demonstrated that apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1), a member in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, is activated upon oxidative stress, leading to cell apoptosis [33]. We demonstrated that the impairment of ROS removal in G6PD-deficient cells resulted in a higher apoptotic activity than in control scramble cells (Figure 3). The caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play essential roles in apoptosis. The classical apoptotic machinery involves the activation of initiator caspases such as caspase-8 and -9 upon death signals, thereby cleaving the inactive pro-forms of effector caspases such as caspase-3 to activate them [27,28].The commencement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway depends on the activation of caspase-8 through the binding of extracellular death ligands to transmembrane death receptors. In contrast, the intrinsic pathway is triggered by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, thereby activating caspase-9. Both pathways can lead to the activation of caspase-3 and other effector caspases [34]. Our results presented here indicate that expression of active caspase-9, as well as the downstream caspase-3, was much higher in G6PD-deficient cells than in control scramble cells upon VRSA infection, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may be the major cause of the increase in cell apoptosis (Figure 4). A recent study demonstrated that the incubation of epithelial cells with enterotoxin isolated from Aeromonas veronii increased the accumulation of intracellular ROS leading to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and thereafter undergoing apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway [20]. The S. aureus strain SJC1200 used in this study was constructed under the ATCC 12598 strain genetic background which is known to lack a variety of exotoxins except for \u03b1-hemolysin [35]. Therefore, we may propose that \u03b1-hemolysin could cause mitochondria dysfunction similar to that found in A. veronii. We further highlight a much worse outcome in G6PD-deficient cells upon bacterial infection. Unlike the lack of mitochondria in peripheral red blood cells (RBCs), the impact of bacterial infection on RBCs (causing hemolysis) and other cells is different in patients with G6PD deficiency. ",

            "text": "Our previous study demonstrated that antibiotic treatment on a drug-resistant S. aureus strain would appear to be an environmental stress that activates \u03c3B, a stress response transcription factor [22]. In that study, vancomycin induced \u03c3B activity led to the alternation of downstream virulence genes in VRSA strains, as well as the increase in cytotoxicity to the human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). The increased expression of bacterial binding capacity, but not the decreased expression of \u03b1-hemolysin, associated with increased \u03c3B activity, might be the key contributor to the cytotoxicity. However, similar results were not observed in this study when the A549 cell line was used, neither in G6PD knock down or in control scramble cells. It has been reported that \u03b1-hemolysin was an important mediator of cytotoxicity in A549 cells whereas it was tolerated by BEAS-2B cells [22,36]. As proposed above, \u03b1-hemolysin should be the major cause of mitochondria dysfunction through the accumulation of ROS in A549 cells and derivatives. Because the expression of \u03b1-hemolysin was decreased in SJC1200 upon vancomycin treatment, the impact of vancomycin treatment on the cytotoxicity of VRSA-infected A549 cells was not obvious in either G6PD knock down or control scramble cells (Figure 1). In fact, vancomycin treatment alleviated the VRSA infection-enhanced ROS accumulation and apoptosis in both cells even though cell survival was not improved (Figures 1-4). This phenomenon may be a result of the increased binding affinity of VRSA to the cells upon vancomycin treatment, which leads to stronger cytotoxicity and possibly bypasses the mitochondria dysfunction pathway, as we reported previously [22]. Therefore, the net impact of vancomycin treatment on A549 cell survival in the presence of infection was similar to the vancomycin-free condition. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that the misuse of antibiotics in other drug-resistant strains will trigger the expression of other exotoxins that can cause a stronger oxidative stress in G6PD-deficient cells. Although the susceptibility of different cell types to different bacterial virulence factors is variable, we suppose patients with G6PD deficiency are less tolerant to bacterial infection. ",

            "text": "In conclusion, we demonstrate a cell damage mechanism in G6PD-deficient epithelial cells upon bacterial infection. Most of the cellular ROS are generated from the mitochondria, where there are a variety of mechanisms to reduce the accumulation of ROS or protect against oxidative stress [37]. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential due to bacterial infection, possibly via S. aureus \u03b1-hemolysin in this case, leads to an increase in ROS production. In G6PD-deficient cells, the impaired reconversion of glutathione disulphide to reduced glutathione caused by the imbalanced NADPH/NADP+ redox state renders the cell unable to remove ROS effectively. Therefore, the accumulation of excess ROS results in stronger cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. One of the most important clinical concerns in treating bacterial infection in patients with G6PD deficiency is to avoid the usage of antibiotics which can cause hemolytic anemia [7]. Vancomycin treatment did not further enhance VRSA cytotoxicity toward G6PD-deficient and control scramble A549 cells, as opposed to what we had previously observed in BEAS-2B cells [22]. ",
