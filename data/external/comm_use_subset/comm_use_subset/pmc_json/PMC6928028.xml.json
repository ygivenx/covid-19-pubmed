High dependency (HD) is a unit that caters for more severely ill patients requiring closer monitoring or non\u2010invasive ventilation without needing ICU admission. Obesity was defined as BMI > 25 kg/m2. Immunosuppression was defined as non\u2010malignancy related immunosuppressive therapy, for example, steroids, biological modifying agents. Pneumonia was defined as fever and cough with chest X\u2010ray (CXR) changes of lobar/broncho\u2010pneumonia or focal infiltrates. Positive bacterial tests were either culture\u2010 positive from any site or positive mycoplasma PCR or serology (particle agglutination IgG antibody \u2265320 single titer).

One previous study showed that children \u226510 years old with influenza B had the greatest odds of ICU admission if previously healthy.21 This age\u2010group also had the highest influenza B Victoria rates, implying that they should receive the quadrivalent vaccine to reduce the chances of a B\u2010mismatched season.22\n",

Our lower comorbidity rate may be related to the health access seeking behavior of parents of previously well children who tend to come to our hospital's emergency department (ED) after office\u2010hours rather than go to the primary care practitioners. If a rapid diagnostic test was offered at the ED, perhaps some of the uncomplicated influenza patients need not have been hospitalized. Targeted testing has been shown to reduce hospital admissions in children and antibiotic usage.23 Regardless, the absence of comorbidity in the majority (75.2%) of our cohort lends support to the use of a universal influenza vaccination in all children regardless of whether they have underlying diseases.",

Of the neurologic complications (n = 151), febrile seizures constituted 80% and status epilepticus 11.3%, encephalitis, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, myelitis 8.6%.

This is similar to previous publications which showed that those aged \u22655 years were more likely to have influenza B but different from Hong Kong where the 2\u2010 to 4\u2010year\u2010age\u2010group had the highest influenza B hospitalization rates.10, 21, 27 In 2013\u20102014, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine was not yet available; the trivalent vaccine would not have covered 5.7% of all strains and up to 10.8% of strains in those \u226510 years. Comparing the two subtypes of influenza A, H3N2 had higher rates of febrile seizures, bacterial pneumonia and lower rates of diarrhea compared to H1N1 pdm2009 (P = .008, .03, .02, respectively). There was no difference in clinical characteristics or severity between the two influenza B lineages, similar to a study from Guangzhou, China.28 In terms of seasonality, influenza A peaks were mainly driven by H3N2 which were more intense and earlier except in mid\u20102014, when H1N1 pdm09 and influenza B peaked in June. This is similar to the H3N2 patterns in Shenzhen and Hong Kong in 2012\u20102013.29 The predominant lineage for influenza B was Yamagata in both years, similar to that of Malaysia.30\n",

However, more severe cases could have been included in this study due to the higher viral burden in respiratory secretions detectable by IF rather than PCR. Obesity was likely under\u2010reported as only 55% of patients had their height taken, thereby leading to an omission of BMI used to determine obesity status. Another limitation was the lack of information of prior influenza vaccination; however, uptake for influenza vaccination in children has generally been poor. Although influenza vaccination is recommended for children under 5 years of age or those with underlying high\u2010risk factors, it is not in the national immunization schedule for children and therefore not routinely offered. As this was a hospital\u2010based study, the observations may have been confounded by the admitting threshold with younger aged children more likely to be admitted. Prior influenza infections would not have been detected as influenza serological testing was not available. It is possible that older children may have had partial immunity to influenza A, not develop severe influenza A and instead be hospitalized for influenza B.",
