Between 2000 and 2017, the number of trips abroad increased 420% across all of Spain\u2019s population[8]. This increase, however, was not continuous throughout the study period, with years in which the number of travelers decreased year-on-year and others with increases of more than 30% (2005\u20132006 and 2006\u20132007). Between 2015 and 2017 the average increase in TAs at the IVCMa was 10%; an increase higher than the 3.9% recorded worldwide in the number of international tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) in the same period[1]. However, travelers who requested information at the IVCs are almost exclusively those who will travel to countries that pose health risks. Thus, when taking the UNWTO region visited into account, the increase at the IVCMa was similar to that for UNWTO Asia and the Pacific (9%) and Africa (8%) regions[1].",

The strongest demand for pre-travel information at the IVCMa also occurred between June and July (Fig 2), with an average of 23.4% and standard deviation (SD) of 3.1 of annual demand for the period 2000\u20132017. This seasonality in demand for health information is similar to tourism demand of European Union residents who, in August and July 2015 and 2016, made approximately 23% and 26%, respectively, of all their trips for the year[11,13]. Between 2000 and 2011, 33.3% (SD 0.93) of trips by EU residents were taken in the third quarter of the year[14]. However, according to data from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE) and Eurostat[15], in some years a reduction in trip seasonality is observed; therefore, the differences between the months of greatest and least demand are proportionally smaller. In this manner, in 2016, an increase of 4% in the number of Spanish residents traveling internationally was observed, and 35% (5,503,892) travelled between July and September, which was down 3.4% from the same period in 2015[8]. In the present study, this reduction in seasonality was not observed. The average annual percentage of travelers served between June and July was 23.4% (SD 3.1) and when comparing annual means, a statistically significant difference was not observed. This could be explained by the fact most trips to areas for which a previous visit to an IVC was recommended, are made between July and September. These months are more conducive to travel, as they coincide with school and other institutional holidays, leading to more pursuit of tourism in Spain and in most of the countries of the northern hemisphere[16]. These trips tend to be also longer than those that do not require prior medical information and can be taken at any time of the year. Weather conditions and forecasts might also influence the holiday length. Moreover, in some destinations, July or August are the best times to avoid adverse weather such as intense rains (e.g., monsoons) or risk of hurricanes and tropical storms[17,18].",

The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., as well as a series of other terrorist attacks between 2001 and 2005, led to a decrease in tourism worldwide[21]. In our study, the number of travelers recorded in 2000 was not again reached until 2005, and new declines were observed in 2008 and 2014. However, other, non-political crises occurred both in the first interval and later. Health-related crises, such as those in 2003 and 2009, respectively due to SARS and influenza A (H1N1), and more recently the Ebola outbreak in 2014, attracted greater worldwide media attention.

Between 2005 and 2017, demand at the IVCMa for advance information related to the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions grew tenfold, from a total of 712 queries in 2005 (28.8%) to 7,165 in 2017 (47.3%). In fact, in 2017, Thailand was the country for which the largest numbers of requests health information were received (14.5% of all annual consultations). Growth of Asian destinations is highly conspicuous in UNWTO projections for 2030[33]. In the EU, trips to Thailand account for 3% of all destinations outside the European Community. In recent years, the Asian region is leading growth of international tourist arrivals; up 9% through September 2017, according to UNWTO figures[15]. The countries of the Mekong sub-region saw inbound tourist arrivals increase from 31.1 million in 2010 to 51.9 million in 2015 (Myanmar was up 490%, Cambodia 91.5%, Thailand 87%, Laos 72% and Vietnam 52%). Such growth for Asian destinations reflects travelers\u2019 perceptions of safety, and the possibility of making cheaper, non-organized trips; therefore, this growth is expected to continue in the coming years[15,34\u201336].",

However, for the SISAEX data, personal responses were given directly to questions from the attending doctor at the IVC, after previously making an appointment. Respondents were then personally informed about recommended prophylaxis depending on their destination. Finally, depending on this consultation, they could receive a necessary vaccine and pay a predetermined fee. Therefore, we expected the presence of any misleading data was limited. In addition, if such data did emerge, the amount would be considerably small in relation to the scale of the total sample studied. Another possible limitation was that we had no data on those who did not go to the IVC to receive health information for their trip, or they received information via other means, such as friends, websites, books or reviews. Finally, our results reflect the internationally traveling population of Malaga between 2000 and 2017 and may not be representative of the traveling population of Spain.",

Most trips to at-risk areas are planned 6 months or longer in advance. Thus, although a crisis can attract a high degree of media attention at a certain time, after several months, travelers\u2019 perceptions may have changed considerably. In this way, when terrorist events are not repeated, the tourism industry can recover in a period of 6\u201312 months[37]. Despite this, because different crises can occur simultaneously in a given country or region, even if using some previously described methods to endogenously determine the effect of individual crises on precise dates[26], it is impossible to know whether a single cause, or several at the same time, were responsible for a tangible effect on international tourism demand.",

Apart from that, the data on the frequency of travel and on destinations as extracted from SISAEX data elucidate could improve understanding of the relationship of the trend in the demand for pre-travel health information and crisis and events that impact tourism. These data together with other data from SISAEX that will soon be incorporated into the system (travel motive, demographic, socioeconomic, health variables) not analyzed in this study will enable determination of socioeconomic indicators on international travelers to health risk areas, and their needs in relation to pre-travel preventive measures. The data collected over a long period and analyzed in relation to crises and events that impact international travel will allow us to examine trends over time and take measures to anticipate travelers\u2019 demands for pre-travel care. Additionally, a sharp increase in the number of travelers, and consequently in the demand for pre-travel health advice, can be expected in accordance with forecasts of international organizations concerned with travel and tourism. This will impel reinforcement of teams of medical professionals at ICVs, especially in periods of high demand. It may also lead to creation of alternative sources of education and vaccination for travelers, which could give potential solutions to anticipated overloads of traveler demand. Different levels of risk should be identified in accordance with the destination, type of travel and traveler; these should be initially identified to adapt the type of care and increase efficiency among resources. Based on the results of this research, it is uncertain to predict the impact of crises or other events on the number of travelers requesting pre-travel medical information, hindering progress towards a general model that allows adapting the resources of medical services from the trip to the demand. Additional studies on the evolution of the demand for pre-travel care, and incorporation of new additional questions, as well as conducting of post-travel studies through surveys given to travelers who previously visited IVCs, should allow us to identify and quantify new travel-related problems and help to improve policies and programs for providing care for travelers.",
