Bovine respiratory disease refers to bacterial bronchopneumonia that may be complicated by previous, or concurrent, viral or Mycoplasma infection [2]. The principal viruses involved in BRD include bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) [2]. Despite advances in veterinary medicine, animal husbandry, and animal welfare, respiratory disease among dairy cattle continues to be a major problem in the dairy industry [3]. In addition to enzootic calf pneumonia, outbreaks of respiratory disease in adult animals can have devastating economic outcomes for dairy owners [3].",

In adult dairy cattle, respiratory disease is less important than mastitis, lameness, or reproductive disorders as a cause of morbidity [2]. According to the Annual Report of the Estonian Animal Recording Centre (EARC, 2009), BRD was the reason for culling dairy cows in 0.7% of cases. According to our experience, in most herds BRD occurs as a sporadic disease in adult dairy cattle. However, epidemic outbreaks occur with high morbidity accompanied with dramatic economic losses due to medication use and discarded milk, as well as cow fatalities.",

Outbreaks of severe respiratory disease due to bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) have been observed in dairy herds throughout Sweden, where adult cattle were most severely affected [7]. Risk factors associated with acute bovine respiratory disease, especially with BRSV outbreaks, were larger herd size, as well as the type of the production with a higher risk in dairy herds compared to beef herds [8,9]. Acute BRD has been found to occur mainly during cold months, with an epidemic peak in December [8]. Despite the multifactorial nature of BRD [3], only limited research data is available on herd management-related risk factors for respiratory disease in adult dairy cattle.",

Problems associated with reduced fertility in dairy cattle are related to: diseases of the reproductive tract of the cow, bull fertility, breeding management, and the environment [10], as well as nutrition [11]. Several infectious diseases are related to abortion in cattle, and BHV-1, BVDV and Neospora caninum are often diagnosed as causes of abortion in cattle world-wide [12]. However, field studies estimating the effect of BHV-1 on herd level reproductive performance have given contrary results. Previous studies [13,14] found no association between the proportion of calves with antibodies against BVDV or BHV-1 virus and reproductive performance in beef herds. A somewhat higher mean open days period was found in cows that were serologically positive for BHV-1 than in seronegative dairy cows [15], however no decrease in reproduction performance was found to occur during an outbreak of BHV-1 in a dairy herd [4]. To our knowledge no epidemiological studies have been published to identify and quantify the association between herd BHV-1 seroprevalence and farm-level reproductive performance in dairy cattle.",

For that, results of the bulk tank milk survey of BHV-1 antibodies of all dairy herds in Estonia completed in 2004 were used. Herds were selected randomly from the list by using random number generator. In total, 65 BHV-1 seropositive and 38 BHV-1 seronegative herds, matched by herd size, were selected for the study.

On each farm the veterinarian or farm manager was questioned about the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease, including nasal discharge (\"red nose\"), respiratory signs (cough, dyspnoea), and lacrimation. The respondents were asked to evaluate the prevalence of these signs among animals of each age group during periods of the highest occurrence of respiratory disease in the previous two years. The scale of the estimation was presented as follows: 1 - no signs or only single cases; 2 - up to 10%; 3 - 10-30%; 4 - over 30%. In order to dichotomize the outcome variables the value of the outcome variables was taken as 1 if more than just a single animals showed the signs concurrently. All of the three variables (see Table 2) were chosen as supplementary variables in Model I when multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was carried out.",

A high prevalence of BRSV (\u226550%) was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in cows and pregnant heifers in the MCA. When combining these three BRD symptoms into one outcome variable in logistic regression analysis, a low to moderate prevalence of BRSV (1-49%) among youngstock was significantly associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease among cows and pregnant heifers. This discrepancy may arise from the fact that relatively small number of herds (n = 14) belong to the highest BRSV prevalence group. This may result in larger standard errors of the estimates in the logistic regression analysis affecting also the p-value of the predictor. MCA on the other hand is not as sensitive to sample size as conditional methods. Sampling antibodies from a small number of young animals that have lost maternal immunity indicates the recent spread of infection [22]. However, some studies have shown that outbreaks of acute respiratory disease associated with BRSV in fully susceptible populations affect adult cattle, pregnant or newly calved cows, most severely [7,9]. Thereafter the disease remains endemic, manifesting itself among younger animals that serve as sentinels [7]. Given that the signs of respiratory disease reported in this study were those associated with the occurrence of respiratory disease in the previous two years, cows and pregnant heifers might have experienced disease caused by BRSV some time previously, following the active spread of the virus among youngstock detected in this study at the time of testing. In a severe outbreak of BRSV in Sweden it was found that concurrent infection with other viruses may affect the expression of disease [7]. In addition to BRSV BHV-1 and BVDV were associated with higher occurrence of BRD in MCA. As associations between variables are not adjusted for the effects of other variables with this method we can't state that BHV-1 and BVDV are direct risk factors for BRD. However, apparent bivariate association between these variable gives a reason to suggest that BHV-1 and BVDV may participate in the expression of BRD rather as contributing agents.",

We can suppose that in herds with a moderate BHV-1 seroprevalence among cows, the level of infection has been low for some time, which enables a susceptible population to evolve, and it is these herds that are most vulnerable to active virus spread and a higher level of endemic abortions. Abortions due to BHV-1 generally occur between four and eight months of gestation, however the infection can also result in early embryonic death [25] resulting in a higher insemination index. As reproduction values were registered retrospectively and antibodies present to BHV-1 reflect virus spread in the past, it is not possible to draw exact cause-effect relationships. Therefore it is possible that poor fertility as well as spread of BHV-1 is influenced by another common factor e.g. poor management practice. A more thorough study involving farm management practices in addition to infections should be conducted.",

The impact of BHV-1 on reproduction performance has also been evaluated indirectly. No associations between the proportion of calves with antibodies against IBR virus and incidence of abortions, stillbirths, calf death, nor non-pregnancy were ascertained [14]. However a 17 day longer period for successful conception was required for BHV-1 seropositive rather than seronegative cows [15].

The result is a scatterplot which identifies clusters of predictors that are closely associated, with clusters farther from the intersection of the axes having stronger associations. The values of the outcome variables were also projected on the same axes to determine which clusters of predictor variable values were associated with the outcomes of interest [21]. A high level of multicollinearity was found using chi-square analysis. Multiple correspondence analysis can be an alternative tool when analysing relationships between different variables in terms of multicollinearity [30]. MCA showed that all supplementary variables belonging to the same category were highly related; this result was used as a justification to generate one outcome variable describing high/low respiratory disease occurrence in cows and pregnant heifers. The latter variable was used as an outcome variable in the logistic regression analysis. MCA also gave an insight into associations between outcome and predictor variables, as well as associations between different predictor variables. As these associations are not adjusted for other variables in the analysis we discuss those as possibly relevant associations. MCA is used as a preliminary analysis to have a clear and reliable view of the variable links in presence of multicollinearity. Our final conclusions confirming the risk factor status of each variable rely on the results of the logistic regression analysis.",

The presence of neither BHV-1 nor BVDV were associated with acute respiratory disease in adult dairy cattle, however these may not be excluded as possible contributors to the disease. Therefore, precautions to prevent the introduction of the BRS virus into herds should be implemented. In order to reduce the incidence of BRD in dairy cattle, on-farm biosecurity measures may be important as well to prevent human-mediated spread of the infections. As indicated in MCA direct animal contacts in loose-housing systems may increase the occurrence of BRD in cows and pregnant heifers, perhaps via increased virus transmission. In order to reduce the circulation of infectious agents in the system, animals should be checked for clinical signs of respiratory disease continuously, and those with symptoms separated immediately from healthy animals. If youngstock and cows are kept in separate units, the aetiology of respiratory disease among both animal groups should be ascertained, followed by the application of specific control measures in order to avoid unprotected animals becoming infected.",
