WNV is the leading cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in humans in many parts of the world. In addition to humans, many animals are also susceptible to WNV infections. Large outbreaks have occurred globally in both humans and other animals, such as horses and pigs. Birds are the natural reservoirs of WNV. Bird-to-bird, bird-to-mammal and bird-to-human transmissions are achieved by mosquito bites, with humans and other mammals serving as dead-end hosts because of low viral loads.",

There are two surviving old-world camel species: Camelus dromedarius (dromedary or one-humped camel), which inhabits the Middle East and North and Northeast Africa, and Camelus bactrianus (Bactrian or two-humped camel), which inhabits Central Asia. Among the 20 million camels on earth, 90% are dromedaries. Although WNV is known to infect some of the new world camels, such as llamas and alpacas,1 only antibodies against WNV have been detected in the sera of old-world camels, such as the dromedaries in the Middle East, North Africa and Spain, with a seroprevalence of 3%\u201338%.2, 3, 4, 5 To date, no WNV has been isolated or amplified from either dromedary or Bactrian camels. Recently, the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the isolation of the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) from dromedaries boosted interest in the search for novel viruses in dromedaries.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 In this article, we report the first isolation of WNV from a dromedary calf in the United Arab Emirates during the process of MERS-CoV screening and the results of the comparative genome and phylogenetic analysis.",

The Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai is the center for performing necropsies of dromedaries from sheikhs in the UAE with the aim of finding the cause of death and preventing the spread of infectious diseases to other camels or herds. Nasal swabs and pooled ground trachea/lung samples were inoculated onto Vero cells for MERS-CoV screening.14 The pooled clinical samples were diluted 10-fold with viral transport medium and filtered. Two hundred microliters of the filtrate was inoculated into 200 \u03bcL of minimum essential medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Four hundred microliters of the mixture was added to 24-well tissue culture plates with Vero cells by adsorption inoculation. After 1 h of adsorption, the excess inoculum was discarded, the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with 1 mL of minimum essential medium (Gibco). Cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 and inspected for cytopathic effects daily using inverted microscopy.",

Standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination, and no amplified PCR product was observed in the negative control.

The purified sequencing library was quantified using the KAPA library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, DE, USA) and subsequently sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 151 bp paired-end reads (Rapid Run Mode).

The first evidence for the presence of hemagglutination inhibiting and complement-fixing antibodies in dromedaries from Nigeria against WNV was published in 1990.21, 22 Recently, a study has shown the presence of neutralizing antibodies against WNV from dromedaries in North Africa.3 In the United Arab Emirates, antibodies against WNV have been reported in 38% of 1119 dromedary sera5 and 19.2% of 750 tested equine sera,23 supporting the conclusion that WNV is present in the country. In the present study, we isolated a WNV from two independent respiratory samples from a dromedary calf using Vero cells, which is one of the most widely used cell lines for the recovery of WNV. This finding was consistent with previous studies that showed that WNV could also be detected in respiratory specimens from birds, humans and other mammals.24, 25 Notably, the glycosylation motif NYS in the E protein, the A70S substitution and P250 in the NS1 protein and the foo motif in the NS2A protein, which are important for pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness, were also detected in the present WNV isolate.18, 19, 20 However, because there were no clinical signs in the dromedary calf, the pathogenic role of WNV in dromedaries remains to be determined. Viral cultures using other samples from the dromedary were not performed because the samples were initially intended for MERS-CoV isolation.",

The whole-genome phylogenetic trees showed that the present dromedary WNV was most closely related to other WNVs in cluster 2 of lineage 1a with high bootstrap support (Figure 2). However, there was no clustering of the present WNV with WNVs isolated in other parts of the Middle East, such as Israel, Egypt and Cyprus (data not shown). Indeed, two WNVs from Israel (Genbank accession number AY688948) and Cyprus (Genbank accession number GQ903680) belong to lineage 2, another isolate from Israel (Genbank accession number HM152773) belongs to cluster 4 of lineage 1a, and two other isolates from Israel (Genbank accession number HM051416) and Egypt (Genbank accession number EU081844) belong to cluster 1 of lineage 1a. Moreover, 14 amino-acid positions located in various regions of the genome encoding five different proteins showed marked differences with the corresponding amino acids in the genomes of the isolate's close relatives in cluster 2. Interestingly, most of the amino-acid differences between the present dromedary WNV and the closely related WNVs from Africa and Europe are located in the E and NS5 genes. The E protein is generally the least conserved protein because it is exposed to external selection pressure, whereas the NS5 protein is highly conserved because it contains the viral methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Complete-genome sequencing of more WNV strains and comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies are needed to ascertain whether dromedary WNVs form a unique cluster in lineage 1a.",

Prior to 2013, viruses from at least eight families were found to infect camels. In the last two years, we have reported the discovery of a novel dromedary camel CoV (UAE-HKU23), a novel genotype of hepatitis E virus, a novel genus of enterovirus, a novel astrovirus, and novel picobirnaviruses and circoviruses in dromedaries.16, 26, 27, 28, 29 These discoveries have remarkably widened the spectrum of viruses known to infect dromedaries. Notably, after the description of the novel genotype of hepatitis E virus in dromedaries, another group found this dromedary camel hepatitis E virus as a cause of chronic hepatitis E infection in a liver transplant recipient with a habit of camel milk and meat consumption, highlighting the importance of camels as a source of infectious diseases.30 The present study is the first demonstration of the isolation of WNV in dromedaries and the first WNV complete-genome sequenced from a dromedary among the relatively few full-length WNV genome sequences from the Middle East. Further studies will help elucidate whether dromedaries can serve as another possible source of WNV infection and determine the tissue tropism of WNV in dromedaries. Other studies on the epidemiology, disease spectrum and ecology of WNV in this group of unique animals are also warranted.",
