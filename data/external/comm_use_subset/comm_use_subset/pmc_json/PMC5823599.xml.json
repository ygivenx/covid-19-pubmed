Damage to the airway epithelium and remodeling of the small airways with fibrotic obliteration and fibrosis of the lung parenchyma are major pathological features of CLAD [2]. Chronic rejection, through allogeneic immune response-induced lymphatic infiltration and lymphoid tissue formation in the lung grafts, is considered the most important contributing factor [3\u20136]. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation mediated by innate immune responses during ischemia-reperfusion in the lung allograft [7, 8] and activation of autoimmunity [9] are also involved in the pathogenesis of CLAD. For example, primary graft dysfunction (PGD), acute lung injury during the first 72 h after lung transplant, is associated with the development of CLAD [10\u201312]. Identification of biomarkers of PGD may help to predict, and possibly prevent, PGD as well as CLAD.",

Following allogeneic transplantation, reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and predisposes to severe complications, including superinfection by Aspergillus species [23]. In a murine model of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, PTX3 treatment induced complete resistance to infection and reinfection with invasive aspergillosis [24]. PTX3 was shown to bind cytomegalovirus, and protected mice from primary viral infection and reactivation as well as Aspergillus superinfection [23]. Genetic deficiency of PTX3 in humans impairs the antifungal capacity of neutrophils and may contribute to the risk of invasive aspergillosis in patients treated with hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation [25].",

The KO group showed a trend towards lower volumes compared to the WT group, even though this difference was not statistically significant when analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA (Figure 1D). We then asked the question whether lung volume recovery differed between the KO and WT groups, by comparing lung volumes to the day 1 baseline. In the WT group, lung volumes were significantly lower on day 7 compared to day 1; however, the volumes recovered from days 14 to 28 (Figure 1E). In contrast, in the KO group, volumes on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 were all significantly lower than day 1 (Figure 1F).

Fan et al., transplanting lungs from C57BL/10 H-2(b) mice into C57BL/6 mice, identified BO lesions at day 28 after lung transplantation [30]. We have recently used this model and demonstrated mixed airway and parenchymal lesions reminiscent of the pathological changes seen in CLAD [31]. The airway BO lesions appear to be a good correlate of airway fibrosis seen in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [32]. In addition, the parenchymal fibrosis is reminiscent of the diffuse lung disease seen in patients with restrictive allograft syndrome [32]. In the present study, we again used C57BL/10 H-2(b) mice as donors, and the recipients were the F2 progeny of C57BL/6 and 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J mice.

The PTX3-/- animals available for our studies were on a mixed 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J background. We generated F2 hybrids of these animals with C57BL/6 mice. Consequently, certain major alloantigens were also present in the recipients in variable quantities, suggesting there may have been some variability in the degree of alloreactivity from recipient to recipient. This may explain some of the pathological variability and the severe lesions in histological sections. Despite this variation, PTX3 deficiency clearly worsened early radiographic appearances of the allograft, day 28 pathology, and cellular infiltration.",

Studies from earlier time points would be helpful for understanding the role of PTX3 in the early stage of development of these pathological changes. However, mouse lung transplantation is a technically challenging protocol requiring extensive training and practice [33]. The mouse availability was further challenged by the infertility of female PTX3-/- mice [16, 18]; as a result, for this initial proof-of-principle study, we used only one time point for tissue collection. To partially compensate for this limitation, we used Micro-CT to follow changes in lung volume and lung appearance after transplantation. More than 50% of grafts from KO recipients showed consolidation; even the grafts without complete consolidation showed significantly less recovery of lung volumes. Micro-CT thus provides a means to monitor the status of the graft in a longitudinal fashion in individual animals. More detailed morphometric analyses of micro-CT scan may be of value and are presently being investigated. A major histocompatibility complex mismatch murine lung transplant model was recently developed, with B6D2F1/J (a cross between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J) (Haplotype H2b/d) mice as donors and DBA/2J (H2d) mice as recipients [34]. Since most of clinical lung transplants are major antigen mismatch, CLAD-related studies with this kind of models should be considered.",

Similarly to IPF, CLAD is a fibrotic process, suggesting that PTX3 is linked to the fibrosis pathway. This is consistent with the clinical studies that report a lack of association between expression levels of PTX3 in plasma and COPD, which is an inflammatory rather than fibrotic process [35\u201337].",

These results are in agreement with previous studies conducted with PTX3 deficient mice. For example, a lack of PTX3 aggravated post-ischemic acute kidney injury, followed by tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and kidney shrinkage, while injection of recombinant PTX3 up to 6 h after reperfusion prevented renal leukocyte recruitment and post-ischemic kidney injury [38]. PTX3 treatment accelerated recovery of kidney function after acute injury, by reducing collagen expression and \u03b1-SMA positivity, and inhibiting interstitial fibrosis [39]. PTX3 also plays a protective role in cardiomyocyte ischemia reperfusion injury with PTX3-deficient mice showing exacerbated heart damage, associated with a greater no-reflow area, increased neutrophil infiltration, decreased number of capillaries, and increased number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes [40]. PTX3 treatment ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages and improved hemodynamic performance [41]. Recent studies suggest that PTX3 produced from bone marrow-derived cells plays a crucial role in cardiac protection against myocardial I/R injury by attenuating infiltration of neutrophils, generation of ROS and inflammatory cytokines [42]. These mechanisms may help explain the severe fibrotic lesions we observed in PTX3 deficient recipients after mouse lung transplantation. Exogenous PTX3 should be considered as a therapeutic option for CLAD in the future.",

Lymphocytic infiltration has been considered as a precursor of fibrous obliteration [3]. Lymphoid neogenesis has been found in animal models of BO [4], as well as in patients with BO or CLAD after lung transplantation [5]. The increased lymphoid aggregates in grafts of KO mice may be due to increased lymphoid infiltration and/or neogenesis of lymphoid tissues, which merits further investigation. We did not find differences in neutrophil or macrophage lung infiltration between KO and WT groups at day 28 post-transplant. The increased cellularity in the lung tissue, therefore, is mainly due to the lymphocytes. Earlier time points should be assessed in the future to further elucidate the mechanisms of PTX3 protection.",

Circulating cytokines and chemokines were not significantly different between PTX3 KO and WT recipients. By contrast, in the lung grafts of PTX3 KO recipients, several cytokine levels were significantly lower than that in WT recipients. IL-2, along with IL-9 and IL-15, are members of one cytokine family, each has a four alpha helix bundle molecular structure; they share the gamma chain of IL-2 receptor for signaling. This family of cytokines functions as a master regulator to influence cell fate decisions, both priming for differentiation and helping to maintain a differentiated state [43]. Interestingly, the levels of IL-12, a cytokine that promotes Th1 differentiation, and IL-5 and IL-10, both are Th2 cytokines, were also reduced in allografts of KO recipinets. These changes appear to be specific, because other cytokines and chemokines examined did not show significant differences. IL-2 promotes Th1 differentiation by inducing IL-12R\u03b22 and IL-12R\u03b21, promotes Th2 differentiation by inducing IL-4R\u03b1 [43]. We speculate that even though T cells and B cells were higher in the allografts of KO recipients than that in WT animals, these cells may be under differentiated. Clearly, further investigation is required to understanding the role of PTX3 in transplantation related cytokine production and differentiation of lymphocytes in the grafts.",

High staining indicated robustly positive cells; medium staining indicated positive stained cells, and low indicated marginal degrees of staining, but not reaching the threshold of true positivity. This machine-learning analytic technique is more precise than manual cell counting and has been described previously [48]. The high and middle intensity positive cells were summed up and divided by the whole lung cell number in the same area (counter-stained with DAPI), to calculate a percentage of CD3 and B220 positive cells.",

Positive staining around vessels and bronchi were excluded from the analysis so as to focus primarily on myofibroblasts in the lung tissue itself, not the vascular and airway smooth muscles. As with CD3 and B220 analysis above, the myofibroblast signal was assessed (this time on a per-pixel basis) by thresholding to identify high, medium, low and negative signal. The staining intensity of positive areas was assessed by counting regions positive for each class of signal, shown in screenshots with red representing very high, yellow high and white medium intensity. These three intensity signals were included as positive staining: \u03b1-SMA positive pixel count (mm2) /total lung area (mm2) X 100%.",
