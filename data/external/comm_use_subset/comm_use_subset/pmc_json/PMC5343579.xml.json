As shown in Fig. 1a, the phylogenetic tree of the full-length genome indicated that the PEDV strains fell into two groups designated G1 and G2. G1 had two subgroups, 1a and 1b, and consisted of CV777, virulent and attenuated DR13, SM98, and an earlier Chinese strain JS2008. G2 also had two subgroups, 2a and 2b (Fig. 1a). Notably, all the strains identified from 2011 to 2015 were in G2. The phylogenetic trees of the full-length genome, ORF1a, ORF1b, E, and M showed that JSCZ1601 fell into G2b. However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a sole subgroup that was separate from the other G2 strains (Fig. 1d). These data indicate that significant variation had occurred in the S gene of JSCZ1601. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree of the S genes revealed that the S-INDEL strains formed a single subgroup in G1.",

And this deletion was also existed in JSCZ1601 compared with G2 strains, such as AH2012 and GD-A.

The death toll from the disease was over one million piglets in South China, with devastating damage to the pig industry. Our genetic analyses showed that the PEDV strains fell into two genogroups, G1 (classical) and G2 (variant)2123. The prevalent strains that caused the outbreak in Asia in late 2010 and the recent outbreaks in North America belonged to the G2 genogroup1331. In this study, we found a PEDV strain JSC1601 with new genetic characteristics while elucidating the molecular characteristics and phylogeny of PEDV field strains in China. The whole-genome phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that JSCZ1601 along with the strains determined post-2010 clustered into genogroup G2. However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a new subgroup that was separated from the other G2 strains. Further, comparative analysis of the amino acid sequence of the S protein revealed that the N-terminal of the JSCZ1601 S protein had a two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with the other G2 members. Compared with the other classical and variant strains, a \u2018G\u2019 insertion was also observed in the 5\u2032 terminal of the JSCZ1601 5\u2032UTR. These data revealed that a PEDV strain with the new molecular characterizations and phylogenies was found in mainland China.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the 5\u2032UTR of PEDV strains were highly conserved71332. In general, strict conservation of these regions is essential for the PEDV life cycle. It is known that the 5\u2032UTRs of coronaviruses form conserved RNA structural elements that are critical for viral replication, subgenomic mRNA transcription, and translation33. In this study, we found a \u2018G\u2019 insertion in the 5\u2032 terminal of the 5\u2032UTR compared with the other PEDV strains. Studies on the beta-coronavirus indicated that stem-loop 4 (SL4) in the 5\u2032UTRs was conserved among group 2 coronaviruses and may have a homolog in groups 1 and 3, and that SL4 may act as a cis-acting element for defective interfering RNA replication through interactions with cellular proteins34. In this study, the 223 T/C mutation was located in the SL4, which was identified in the 168\u2013297nt region34. How these insertion and mutations affect the efficiency of virus replication needs to be addressed in future studies. The core sequence (5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032) in the transcription-regulating sequence of PEDV, which was also present in JSCZ1601, was reported to be a determinant factor in transcriptional regulation in coronavirus because the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA requires the appropriate tertiary structure of the core sequence35.",

Significant genetic variations in the S gene have been revealed between the newly determined PEDV field strains and early isolates2138. In this study, the amino acid sequence of the JSCZ1601 S protein shared only 97.6\u201398.1% identities with the S proteins of the reference strains. Besides, the phylogenetic analyses showed that the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a separated subgroup in G2. All these data implied that the S gene of JSCZ1601 had undergoing significant genetic changes. The spike ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2. S1 contains two domains, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, both of which can potentially function as receptor-binding domains3940. Several neutralizing epitopes (499\u2013638, 748\u2013755, 764\u2013771, and 1,368\u20131,374 amino acids) have also been identified173641. In this study, the deduced JSCZ1601 S protein had a two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) in the S1 N-terminal domain. And this deletion completely eliminated a potential N-glycosylation site that was present in the S proteins of the other strains. Moreover, five unique amino acid substitutions were identified in one neutralizing epitope of the S1 C-terminal domain of the JSCZ1601 S protein compared with the S proteins of all the PEDV reference strains. Whether these amino acids substitutions and the N-glycosylation site deletion influence the antigenicity and pathogenicity of PEDV remains to be investigated.",

Three strains, which has a large deletion in S gene, MF3809 with 711\u2013914 amino acid deletion42, TC PC177 with 34\u2013226 amino acid deletion27 and Tottori2-JPN-2014 with 25\u2013214 amino acid deletion26 compared with the reference strain CV777 (Fig. 5). This finding suggested that positions 25\u2013226 in subunit S1 and 711\u2013914 in subunit S2 of the spike ectodomain may be non-essential regions in PEDV infection. The pathogenicity of the Tottori2-JPN-2014 strain has been reported to be mild26. Further, the novel PEDV strains with new amino acid deletions in their S genes have been found in fields in China. The S proteins of strains FJAX1 and FJAX2 were found to have a 66\u201367 amino acid deletion28 and the S protein of HLJ2015/DP1\u20131 had a 377\u2013380 amino acid deletion29 compared with the CV777 S protein. However, the pathogenicity of these three strains has not been reported so far. A Chinese variant strain FL2013, which had a seven amino acid deletion (FEKVHVQ) in the C-terminus of the deduced S protein compared with the S proteins of the other G2 PEDV sequences, had reduced virulence in newborn piglets30. Together, these findings revealed that the genetic evolution of PEDV strains was variant, and the S gene of PEDV might be an important virulence gene. It is important to monitor the genetic variations in this virus, and virulent genes and regions of the PEDV genomes should be identified using the reverse genetic technologies. In addition, we also have investigated 35 samples from different pig farms in different cities and provinces (data not shown), and only one pig farm was found to have the epidemic of this strain JSCZ1601. These data indicated that the strain had a certain ability to spread, and the positive monitoring and prevention of epidemic of the strain is necessary.",

Several important pathogens, such as TGEV, RV, PRRSV, PCV, CSFV, and PRV, were confirmed to be negative in these samples (data not shown). We also checked several intestinal samples obtained from different piglets from different sows. The S gene sequences of these samples had the same characteristics as the JSCZ1601 S gene, which confirmed the severe diarrhoea epidemic was caused by the PEDV strain JSCZ1601. In order to measure the pathogenesis of JSCZ1601 in newborn piglets further, we used the virus inocula prepared from the intestine tissue sample and found that the JSCZ1601 strain could cause severe watery diarrhoea in piglets. And the low challenge dose (3 ml 1.42\u00d7104copies/ml inocula each piglet) might be one reason for the delayed time of diarrhea and the longer duration of disease. These results also revealed that the two-amino-acid deletion in the S protein did not attenuate the pathogenicity of the JSCZ1601 strain. We tried to isolate this strain in vitro using different Vero cell lines with trypsin, but failed. We will make attempts to obtain the virus isolate further.",

Pigs were fed a mixture of liquid milk replacer and yogurt and had free access to water. Groups A was challenged orally with 3 ml inocula. The four control piglets (Group B) were inoculated with PBS. All animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, including diarrhea and vomiting. Rectal swabs were collected for scoring fecal denseness (scores: 0 normal; 1 pasty stool; 2 semiliquid diarrhea; and 3 liquid diarrhea) and for enumerating fecal viral RNA shedding by RT-qPCR. At necropsy, intestinal tissues and contents were grossly evaluated. Additionally, a portion of the jejunum and ileum were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology. The villous atrophy is a typical histopathological change of the infection of a highly virulent PEDV44454647. And the villous height and crypt depth (VH:CD) ratios would be calculated using a computerized image system with as previous described44.
