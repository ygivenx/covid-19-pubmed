FCoVs belong to subgroup 1a of Coronaviruses in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. Other members of this subgroup include porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, canine coronavirus, raccoon/dog coronavirus and Chinese ferret badger coronavirus [1,2]. FCoVs are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with a large, capped and polyadenylated RNA genome of about 29 kb. The cap structure at the 5' end of genome is followed by an untranslated region (UTR). At the 3' end of the genome is another UTR of 275 nucleotides, followed by the poly (A) tail. The sequences of the both 3'- and 5'-UTR are important for RNA replication and transcription [3].",

Infection with FECV is usually unapparent or manifested by a transient gastroenteritis. In contrast, FIPV infection causes a fatal immune-mediated disease with a wide spectrum of clinical signs. FIP refers to the more common effusive (wet) form of the disease characterized by peritonitis and/or pleuritis. The effusive form is caused by complement-mediated vasculitis and results in inflammatory exudation into body cavities. In some FIP cases, partial cell-mediated immunity cause non-effusive (dry) form which is characterized by granulomatous involvement of various organs particularly central nervous system and eyes. However, the FIP forms can transform to each other [4-6]. It has been suggested that virulent FIPV arises by mutation from parental FECV in the individual, persistently infected host [4,7,8]. It is not yet clear which alterations in the FCoV genome are responsible for the generation of FIPV from FECV [3,6].",

Although, the PCR results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical or pathological findings, detection of the virus in FIP-suspected cats may be useful to confirm FIP. Since FCoVs are ubiquitous in cats with high seroprevalence [5,6,12], PCR provides the obvious advantage over serology by directly detecting FCoV genome rather than documenting a previous immune system encounter with the coronavirus. The primers of this PCR assay were chosen from a highly conserved region of 3'UTR of the FCoV genome to detect most, if not all of the FCoV strains. The usefulness of these primers for a general screening test has been reported previously [14-16].",

However, these studies did not conclude that these two breeds were more susceptible to FIP because of limited variation in cat breeds presented at UVH-UPM and lack of clinical cases of FIP in different breeds in Malaysia. Furthermore, in a study on the prevalence of FIP in specific cat breeds, DSH and Persian cats were at low risk compared to others [18].
