The infectious period is the interval of time during which an infected individual can transmit the disease. Time in our model is represented in days. Measles, for example, has an infectious period of approximately 8 days; individuals can transmit the disease from approximately 4 days before rash onset until 4 days after21. \u03b3 controls the transition from infectious to recovered (see equations (2) and (3)). \u03b2 is commonly referred to as the \u201cforce of infection\u201d because it describes how quickly a disease can move through a population. It is the product of \u03b3 and the reproductive number (R0), and controls the transition from susceptible to infectious (see equations (1) and (2)). The reproductive number, R0, is the number of secondary infections per primary infection (see equation (4)). Of note, R0 can be estimated a number of ways. Obadia et al.22 describe an overview of several common methods including exponential growth, maximum likelihood, sequential bayesian and a time-dependent method. Each method makes slightly different assumptions, and can result in different reproductive values. Values should be calculated and interpreted with these caveats in mind23.",

Conversely, \u03bb = 1 is a control measure that is 100% effective, or removes all susceptible individuals in one time interval.

For example, \u03bb = 0.1 and \u03c4 = 5 indicates a scenario where 10% of the susceptible population is removed every day on and after the 5th day. This would describe an intervention like vaccination or quarantine. However, it does not describe the type of control measure that reduces infectivity, changes human behavior in a way that affects population density (e.g., staying home from work/school), or does not confer immunity to the infection (e.g., hand washing). Further, the control measure is continuously applied at each time point after initiation (e.g., 10% of the susceptible population are vaccinated each day for the remainder of the outbreak). This assumes that the control is implemented with the same effectiveness throughout each time interval. These assumptions simplify the addition of control measures to the SIR model, but it is relatively straightforward to modify this implementation in the future to a more realistic scenario. These equations are also limited to describing one control measure. It would be comparatively straightforward to substitute \u03bb with a vector of parameters as opposed to a single term, in order to describe multiple control types and effectivenesses.",

As a result, SIR models are scoped to diseases that meet the following criteria:The disease is transmitted person-to-person. This means the disease is not transmitted via vector, or environmental component like water or food.Disease transmission can be described via homogenous mixing. This means that if a group of susceptible people interact with an ill person, all susceptible person are equally likely to acquire infection. Of importance, a majority of infections do not meet this assumption. For example, sexually transmitted infections are not transmitted with equal probability among the entire susceptible population. Even in the case of airborne infections like measles this assumption ignores individuals\u2019 specific immune responses (e.g., immunocompromised individuals are treated the same as healthy individuals).The disease confers immunity. This means that once an individual has recovered they cannot get contract the illness again during the same outbreak. Diseases with very short-term (or no) immunity are commonly modeled with SI models.The disease\u2019s incubation period is relatively short. Diseases with long incubation periods should include the \u201cexposed\u201d category and can be modeled with a SEIR model25.The disease is an acute illness (i.e., infected individuals recover or die).

By examining these values in various parameter ranges, we can begin to see the effects of parameter ranges on \u03ba results. In Table 3, we consider (1) the entire range, (2) the lower 50th percentile of both \u03b3 and \u03b2 values or (3) the upper 50th percentile of both \u03b3 and \u03b2 values. There is a strong distinction between outbreaks with large values (upper 50th percentile) compared to outbreaks with small values. For example, in measles outbreaks, although it is possible to reduce the outbreak to 10% of the uncontrolled outbreak by beginning a control measure 29 days after outbreak onset, dividing the outbreaks into upper and lower 50th percentiles indicates this is actually only possible if both the \u03b2 and \u03b3 parameters fall into the lower 50th percentile and the control is at least 19% effective.
