            "text": "Mast cells are best known for their role in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent allergic responses as one of the most powerful reactions of the immune system [1]. Recent studies suggest that mast cells may also be involved in innate and adaptive immunity by producing high levels of chemokines and cytokines [1-3]. Mast cells are derived from haematopoietic progenitor cells that enter nearly all vascularized tissues, where they complete their maturation and, in some cases, can migrate into epithelia [1-4]. After appropriate activation, such as the aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI), mast cells can produce a range of pro-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines [5,6]. Crosslinking of Fc\u03b5RI-bound IgE with multivalent antigen initiates the activation of mast cells by promoting the aggregation of Fc\u03b5RI [7,8]. This Fc\u03b5RI-dependent cell activation process has three major outcomes: degranulation, secretion of preformed mediators stored in cytoplasmic granules \u2013 these granules contain vasoactive amines, neutral proteases, proteoglycans and some cytokines and growth factors; the de novo synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (such as eicosanoids); and the synthesis and secretion of cytokines and chemokines [4-8].",

Because the IgE dependent release of proinflammatory mediators can begin within minutes of antigen challenge, the crucial role of mast cells in acute allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis and acute attacks of atopic asthma, is now widely accepted [4,5,7,8]. On the other hand, the role of mast cells in chronic inflammation and other long-term tissue changes that are observed in some IgE associated diseases, including asthma, still debated [10]. However, in recent studies it is suggested that mast cells can markedly enhance antigen-dependent airway hyper reactivity, airway eosinophil infiltration, and the increased number of proliferating cells in the airway epithelium [11-14]. These reports and other lines of evidence, suggest that a key role of mast cells in IgE-associated immune responses is to amplify both acute and long-term local tissue responses to relatively weak biological signals [5,9,11,12]. Moreover, through their ability to release immunoregulatory cytokines, and perhaps through other mechanisms, mast cells might also influence the development, strength and persistence of T-helper 2 cell-associated immunity. However, such immunoregulatory functions of mast cells have not been fully characterized. Mast cells have also been proposed to play a role in mediating bacterial clearance by releasing cytokines, and by ingesting and killing opsonized bacteria, suggesting that mast cells have a physiological role in modulating host defenses against infectious agents [13].",

These previous findings show that mast cells, apart from being principal players in allergies, appear have effects in the initiation and regulation of innate immunity. There is increasing evidence demonstrating that the innate and adaptive immune systems cooperate through shared signaling mechanisms, and very recently it was shown that mast cells may regulate the recruitment of T-cells to lymph nodes [15]. Several groups have carried out limited gene expression profiles of mast cells, without any stimuli [16-18]; stimulated by cytokines [19]; triggered by antigens and in response to the inhibition of calcium-ATPase [20]; or stimulated by TLR4 [21]; or focused on the cytokine/chemokine profile triggered by Fc\u03b5RI aggregation [21-23]. A recent study has shown that IgE alone can induce the release of the interlukin-8 (IL-8) and of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) [24]. However, many aspects of the genetic responses triggered by IgE-antigen on human mast cells are still unclear, such as the overall genetic responses to IgE sensitization alone, or wide-genome expression profile triggered by Fc\u03b5RI aggregation. Thus, we decided to analyze the differential gene expression profile of 8,793 fully-annotated genes, after IgE sensitization, and following Fc\u03b5RI aggregation.",

A substantial number of genes were regulated by IgE sensitization alone; and following Fc\u03b5RI aggregation, a wide range of genes were triggered, including genes for cytokines, chemokines, transcription factors, anti-apoptosis, and several genes involved in innate and acquired immunity. Some of the most prominent findings are the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, involved in innate and adaptive immunity. We also observed the upregulation of several receptors involved in innate immune reactions. We confirmed that IgE alone does not trigger mast cell-immediate responses, such as calcium signals, degranulation or protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas Fc\u03b5RI aggregation did indeed trigger these immediate responses. Thus, these results represent a substantial advance in our understanding of the genome-wide effects triggered by the physiological \"passive sensitization\" or \"active stimulation\" of human mast cells, and suggest that mast cell activation may not only play a pivotal role in allergic responses, but may influence the regulation of other inflammatory immune responses.",

Human mast cells are very difficult to isolate in numbers that would allow for wide-genome expression profiling studies: for that reason we isolated CD34+ progenitor hematopoietic cells from umbilical cord blood and differentiated them to mast cells by culturing with the cytokines SCF and IL-3. After culturing CD34+ progenitor cells with cytokines for 5\u20136 weeks, cells were characterized as Mast Cells by flow cytometry as positive for the specific mast cell marker intracellular chymase; positive c-Kit/CD117+ and Fc\u03b5RI+, and by Toluidine blue staining (Figure 1).

Gene expression analysis using cDNA or oligo-DNA microarrays has proven to be a sensitive method to develop and refine the molecular determinants of several human disorders, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. We analyzed the expression pattern of 8,793 transcripts from the stimulated mast cells, and compared the expression patterns with control/unstimulated samples. The complete gene expression data of our experiments, representing 8,793 probeID is available at the NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus [25], and is accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE1933 (25). The microarray analysis revealed that 760 genes (~8.6%) were differentially expressed between resting and stimulated mast cells with statistical significance (P \u2264 0.05), which were hierarchically clustered (Figure 2). Because of the relatively large number of genes that were differentially regulated, we focused on genes that were upregulated by at least a 2-fold in any time point of mast cell stimulation. Of the 760 genes, 58 genes were initially upregulated (at least 2-fold) by IgE-sensitization alone (Table. 1), and a total of 115 genes were overexpressed (by 2-fold or more in at least one time point), during the time course of mast cell activation by IgE-alone or after crosslinking Fc\u03b5RI (Table. 1). In order to examine the global characteristics of these genes, we used the Gene Ontology Consortium database for Biological processes [26]. Using this database we analyzed the genes that were upregulated by at least 2-fold, thus, allowing us to separate the 115 genes, into the following functional families: (a) cytokines and cytokine receptors; (b) chemokines and chemokine receptors; (c) other immunoregulatory genes; (d) cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis; (e) adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling; (f) transcription factors and regulators of transcription; (g) signal transduction; (h) genes involved in other cellular functions \"others\" (Table 1 & Figure 3)",

Among the most prominent findings was the upregulation of genes coding for the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 (3.3 fold), IL-6 (2.7 fold), and CSF1 (1.6 fold); genes coding for the chemokines IL-8 (CXCL8) (2.1 fold), MIP1\u03b2 (CCL4) (3.5 fold), MCP3 (CCL7) (2.1 fold), GRO\u03b1 (CXCL1) (2.3 fold) and GRO\u03b3 (CXCL3) (1.6 fold), were also upregulated.

One of the key roles for IL-1\u03b2 is to trigger the upregulation of key proinflammatory proteins [27]. We also observed the upregulation of PTX3 (pentaxin-related gene) (Table. 1c): PTX3 is a protein involved in inflammation that is rapidly upregulated by IL-1\u03b2. Other cytokine genes that were upregulated are CSF1 (a growth promoting cytokine), and the cytokine receptors IL1R1, IL27RA, TNFRSF9, TNFRSF12 and IL1RN (Table. 1a). We also found that the level of expression of genes coding for the chemokines IL-8 (CXCL8), CCL7 (MCP3), CCL4 (MIP1\u03b2) and CXCL1 (GRO\u03b1) was increased (Table 1b). IL-8 plays a major role in inflammatory responses mainly due to its ability to recruit and activate neutrophils. CCL7, CCL4 and CXCL1 are known to recruit monocytes, NK, basophils, dendritic cells and TH2 cells. Moreover, our data also show that several other chemokine genes were upregulated during mast cell stimulation: these include CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL3 (GRO\u03b3), and the chemokine receptor CCRL2 (Table. 1b). These data suggest a key role for Fc\u03b5RI in triggering an a wide range of inflammatory responses, as the over-expression of cytokines and chemokines is a prerequisite to triggering inflammation, including vascular permeability, and leukocyte and lymphocyte recruitment, differentiation and activation.",

In our study we observed that a substantial number of genes coding for intracellular signaling proteins were upregulated, by at least 2-fold (Table. 1g). These include genes for serine protein kinases of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase family, such as MAP2K3 and MAP3K14: members of this family of kinases not only play a role in mitogenesis, but can potentially lead to the activation of transcription factors. The gene coding for the tyrosine kinase FYN (FYN oncogene related to SRC, FGR, YES) was also upregulated (Table. 1g): FYN is a member of the Src-tyrosine kinase family; members of this family are critical for the signal transduction cascades triggered by all antigen receptors including by Fc\u03b5RI, TCR, Fc\u03b3Rs, and the B-cell antigen receptor. Several genes coding for protein phosphatases were also upregulated, including several members of the dual specificity phosphatase family coding for DUSP1, DUSP2, and DUSP6 (Table. 1g). Moreover, we show here the upregulation of genes that code for oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor (OLR1), and for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (Table. 1g), indicating a potential role for mast cells in cholesterol homeostasis. Of particular interest is the upregulation of the gene coding for the lipid kinase, sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) (Table. 1g). We and others have previously reported that SPHK1 plays a critical role in the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by Fc\u03b5RI in mast cells [28,31], and coordinates several physiological responses triggered by activated mast cells.",

It is possible that most of the enhanced IgE dependent functions that are observed after antigen or anti-IgE-induced Fc\u03b5RI aggregation, in cells that have been sensitized with IgE, are a consequence of the higher level of Fc\u03b5RI expression. However, a controversial question remains as to whether monomeric IgE can also have more direct effects on mast cell functions. Many studies over the years have shown no evidence that the binding of monomeric IgE can induce detectable signaling or production of mediators by mast cells. However, some groups have reported that monomeric IgE can enhance mast cell survival and trigger cytokine production [24,28,33]. In contrast, a recent study by Matsuda et al [24], fail to find any ability of IgE to enhance mast cell survival on withdrawal of SCF. Interestingly, the study by Matsuda et al, also showed that IgE sensitization alone can induce the upregulation of cytokines and chemokines at the protein level, namely IL-8 and MCP1 [24]. In agreement to this, we show that IL-8 is induced by IgE alone at the mRNA as well as at the protein level (table 1, and Figures 4 and 5), in contrast we could not detect any significant increment on MCP-1 levels, we can speculate that this difference could be due to the different amounts IgE used (1 \u03bcg/mL vs 2.5 \u03bcg/mL). However, we also show the upregulation of various chemokines, including the MCP-1-related protein MCP-3, which was also upregulated by IgE alone (table 1, and Figures 4 and 5). In our present study, we found that several genes related to proliferation were upregulated by IgE alone (Table 1); however, whether these genes, if fully transcribed, may be able to trigger mast cell proliferation in the absence of SCF is not known.",

Perhaps the most prominent of these transcription factors, is NF\u03baB. NF\u03baB represents a family of related proteins which dimerize to form transactivating complexes [35]. NF\u03baB dimmers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by interaction with inhibitory proteins (the I\u03baBs). Various stimuli activate kinase signaling cascades that result in the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB, thereby releasing NF\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of target genes. Many studies have emphasized the role of this transcription factor in regulating genes at critical points in immune-cell development and activation [37]. Many NF\u03baB targets are antiapoptotic [38], which may explain the importance of the NF\u03baB pathway in oncogenesis and resistance to chemotherapy [39,40]. During an immune-response several genes are triggered by the NF\u03baB, these include genes coding for the various proinflammatory molecules, such as MIPs, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1, GRO\u03b1 and other cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules ICAM, VCAM and selectins [41].",

            "text": "As immune cells progress through development and respond to antigenic challenge, they trigger signal transduction pathways that alter their cellular functions and the activity of transcription factors, changing their effector functions and their gene expression profiles. During mast cell activation, many signaling molecules are engaged in diverse responses, ranging from calcium release from internal stores, degranulation, the generation of lipid-derived proinflammatory mediators and the production of cytokines and chemokines. In our study we observed that a substantial number of genes coding for intracellular signaling proteins were upregulated, by at least 2-fold, during mast cell stimulation (Table. 1g). Interestingly, we observed a substantial upregulation of the mRNA for sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), even by IgE alone, this upregulation was also confirmed at the protein level. Sphingosine kinases are novel enzymes that phosphorylate sphingosine (a membrane lipid), to generate the bioactive molecule sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), which is implicated in several inflammatory responses. We and others have previously reported that SPHK1 plays a critical role in the intracellular signaling pathways triggered by Fc\u03b5RI in mast cells [28,31], and coordinates several physiological responses triggered by activated mast cells. We showed that SPHK1 is involved in the calcium signals triggered by Fc\u03b5RI aggregation in human mast cells, as well as playing a critical role for mast cell degranulation [31]. Previously, we reported a pivotal role for SPHK1 in monocyte activation by the high-affinity IgG receptor (Fc\u03b3RI) [42,43], showing that SPHK is key in triggering calcium release from internal stores, and the activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Moreover, very recently we demonstrated the role of SPHK1 in inflammatory responses triggered by the anaphylatoxin C5a in human neutrophil and macrophages. These responses include: calcium signals, degranulation, cytokine production and chemotaxis triggered by C5a [44,45]. The observation that the gene encoding for SPHK1 is activated during IgE-sensitization of mast cells, coupled to the findings above may indicate a key role for SPHK1 in mast cell triggered responses.",

The method of global gene expression analysis using cDNA or oligo-DNA microarrays has proven to be a sensitive method to identify and define/redefine the molecular determinants of several human disorders, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, and has provided us with signatures of the immune response [41]. Using this technology, complemented with powerful analytical methods, we compared the gene expression profiles of human mast cells stimulated by IgE sensitization, and from a series of time points of Fc\u03b5RI aggregation, with unstimulated/control human mast cells. Whether changes in gene expression, under these conditions, are representative of a pathological state is not currently known. It is also not known whether IgE/antigen and Fc\u03b5RI aggregation will trigger the same set of genes in an organism, where a number of events may be activating mast cells at the same time. However, taken together, our data brings us better insights into the molecular basis of mast cell activation, and provides meaningful information, regarding the mechanisms by which mast cell activation may contribute to the overall activation of the immune response, having clinical implication for improving not only allergic conditions but potentially other inflammatory diseases, where mast cells may play a role.",

In conclusion, our present study provides information that mast cells, by generating a broad range of cytokines and chemokines, may be a potent contributor of the immune response by recruiting and/or activating other immune-effector cells including the activation of lymphocytes that may, in turn, continue the spreading of the inflammatory response. Moreover, changes in the gene expression pattern of transcription factors, intracellular signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal remodeling and anti-apoptosis pathways occur, which would also contribute to the amplification of the inflammatory response. Mast cells are well established innate immune-effector cells, and there is mounting evidence to, at least, suggest that mast cells may contribute to the development of acquired immunity [46,47], whether in host defense or in allergic or autoimmune diseases. It will be pivotal to define in more detail whether and under which circumstances mast cells may influence the development and/or magnitude of acquired immune responses.",
