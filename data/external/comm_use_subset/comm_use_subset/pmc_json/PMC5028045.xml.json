Apoptotic processes, initiated from within infected cells or through effector molecules of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are essential for the removal of virus-infected cells [24]. An earlier study using the bovine transcriptome microarray suggested a potential role for the inhibition of apoptosis in persistent FMDV infection [25]. That study demonstrated relatively lower expression of pro-apoptotic genes in the NP compared to the lungs, which are permissive to FMDV replication during early infection [12] but do not become persistently infected [10].",

Early defects in proliferation, IL-2 production and cytotoxicity are followed by the loss of TNF and IFN-\u03b3 production at late stages. With the increasing expression of inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4, exhausted cells become more responsive to inhibitory signals, resulting in further decreased effector function [29]. Apart from cell-surface inhibitory receptors, suppressive cytokines and regulatory T (Treg) cells are centrally involved in the pathogenesis of T-cell exhaustion [28, 30].",

These inducible Treg cells control immune homeostasis by suppressing effector T cells, particularly in the context of chronic infections [33].

The expression of OSR1 was significantly reduced in carriers compared to na\u00efve controls (S3 Table); its knockdown in vitro inhibits apoptosis [43]. In the direct comparison between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, ANKRD1 was the most strongly overexpressed gene in the non-carriers. ANKRD1 encodes a pleiotropic protein of a conserved family of ankyrin-repeat proteins that interferes with transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 signaling [44] and promotes apoptosis [45]. Overall, these results suggest that differences in the expression of genes involved in death receptor signaling and apoptosis may play an important role in the FMDV carrier/non-carrier divergence.",

Functional effector T cells can transiently express inhibitory receptors during activation and PD-1 is constitutively expressed by follicular T-helper cells [48]. High expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, however, is a key feature of the exhaustion of CD4 and CD8 T cells [28]. PD-1 and other cell surface inhibitory receptors as well as transcription factors that co-regulate T-cell exhaustion (CTLA-4, LAG-3, BTLA, and Tim-3, BATF, NFAT1 and eomesodermin) [47, 49] were all significantly overexpressed in NP tissues from persistently FMDV-infected carriers (Table 6).",

Apoptosis plays a vital role in immune homeostasis [76], and the observed regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes could be a consequence of immune system activation with or without impact on FMDV persistence.

To clear a virus infection, infected cells must be safely eliminated before infectious virus progeny is released [24]. This is achieved via immune mechanisms that trigger the apoptosis of infected cells followed by phagocytic removal of the apoptotic cells [77]. Phagocyte-mediated clearance of intact apoptotic cells is essential to protect the surrounding tissue against the uncontrolled leakage of cellular contents [78]. Factor H plays an important role in this process by preventing complement activation, membrane attack and cell lysis [71, 79], and its downregulation in FMDV carriers could lead to an uncontrolled release of infectious viral progeny from apoptotic cells.",

A possible origin for this TH2 bias in persistently FMDV-infected carriers is the overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotrienes. PGE2 inhibits the production of TH1 cytokines but not of TH2 cytokines, selectively suppressing effector functions of TH1 immunity while at the same time promoting TH2 responses [82]. An inflammatory process that leads to a local increase of PGE2 skews the immune response toward increasingly dominant production of TH2-associated cytokines in a positive feedback loop [83], thereby favoring a humoral over a cell-mediated immune response.",

Upon activation, Tr1 cells suppress both na\u00efve and memory T-cell responses through multiple suppressor mechanisms, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 as secreted cytokines, and various surface molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 [87]. IL-10 in particular is critical for the maintenance of persistent viral infections [88], and many viral pathogens specifically exploit the IL-10 pathway to help evade host immunity [89]. The PD-1 pathway also has an important role in limiting the effectiveness of antigen-specific T cells during many persistent infections [90], and it has recently been demonstrated that PGE2 acts synergistically with PD-1 in this suppression [91].",

Since there was no significant difference between the transcriptomes of vaccinated versus non-vaccinated carriers, these data suggest that at 21 dpi and beyond, the effects of FMDV carrier status are more profound than the effects of vaccination.",

A separate-channel approach using a common correlation model [116] was used to analyze the two-color array data. The probes were not pre-filtered. For each of the 43768 bovine transcriptome and FMDV genome probes, the (technical) intra-spot correlation between the channels was estimated across all arrays and used to fit a linear model to the data in terms of the individual log-intensities. Once the linear model was fitted, inference proceeded in the same way as for log-ratios in a fully connected experimental design [116].",
