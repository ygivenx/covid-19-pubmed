It is the causative agent of porcine TGE, leading to vomiting, acute diarrhoea, dehydration and a nearly 100% mortality in suckling piglets [3]. Current vaccines, neither inactivated nor attenuated, cannot provide full protection to pigs [4]. Therefore, it is urgent to discover and develop a novel anti-TGEV candidate to reduce the economic losses caused by TGE.",

It consists of an anionic seven-membered peptide cyclo and a mixture of several hydrophobic \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acids with chain lengths of 13\u201315 carbon atoms [6]. By this amphiphilic structure, surfactin is one of the strongest biosurfactants. Studies on surfactin are focused on properties against phytopathogenic microorganisms, such as antibacterial [7], antifungal [8], inhibition of fibre clot formation [9] and antiviral [10,11] ability. Some reports showed that surfactin could inactivate various enveloped virus, like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, rhabdoviridae) and suid herpes virus type 1 (SHV-1, pseudorabies virus) , by inserting into the outer layer of lipid membrane bilayer so that the envelope disintegrates [12]. But whether surfactin has the activity against TGEV, an animal enveloped virus from coronaviridae family, remains poorly understood. Moreover, our colleagues had reported that B. subtilis could antagonize enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection [13]. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effects of B. subtilis OKB105 and its surfactin against TGEV entry in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2) cells.",

On the other side, OKB105 reduced the relative amounts of viral RNAs in the pre-treatment and co-treatment, where cells existed. While B. subtilis 168 could only decrease the relative amounts of viral RNAs in the pre-treatment (Figure 2A). Second, for different \u2018drugs\u2019 in the same treatment, B. subtilis OKB105 showed the best suppression activity in the pre-treatment, where it had enough time of interacting with the cells. However, in the out-treatment, where the cells were not present, B. subtilis did not show significant inhibition, while surfactin did. Similar results were obtained in the Western blotting analysis (Figure 2B).

To our knowledge, IPEC-J2 cells can express TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR8, TLR9 and TLR10, but only TLR1, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 were expressed at the cells\u2019 surface [34,35]. Regretfully, the TLR-2 was not detected in our IPEC-J2 cells (results not shown). Surprisingly, our results showed that the expression of TLR-6 was up-regulated after incubation with B. subtilis 168 and OKB105 (Figure 6). The results were supported by the fact that TLR-6 was a TLR that could identify the lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria [36]. TLR-6 was reported as a novel member of TLRs by Takeuchi et al. [37] in 1999, and it consisted of the signalling pathway of TLR2\u2013TLR6\u2013MyD88, MDA-5\u2013IPS-1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways [38].",

Additionally, studies have reported that apoptosis was an important regulatory mechanism in intestine maturation [42]. In the present study, after a short-time incubation, all the three treatments could depress the percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure 7). And the depression of the percentage of apoptotic cells was better in the single treatment, where the TGEV did not exist, which might indicate that the TGEV could induce the apoptosis of this IPEC-J2 cells to some extent. Interestingly, Kim et al. [43] determined that surfactin could induce pro-apoptotic of LoVo cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line, when treated for 24 h. While in our study, we found that after treating with 0.002 \u03bcg/ml surfactin for 1.5 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells was depressed, which indicted that a safe dose and for a safe time, surfactin could display a positive effect on cells. But how surfactin affect the cells, especially animal cells needs more penetrating study.",
