            "text": "To comprehensively screen the crude extract of Chinese licorice for virus NP ligand discovery, we devised a workflow combining affinity mass spectrometry and metabolomics approaches (Fig. 1A). The recombinant core domains of Ebola virus NP (EBOV NP, amino acids 36\u2013351) and Marburg virus NP (MARV NP, amino acids 19\u2013370) were purified and separately incubated with Chinese licorice extract before ultrafiltration was performed to isolate ligand-bound NP complexes. The compound mixture dissociated from the NP complexes or the protein-free control was subjected to metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) (full datasets in Supplemental Table S1). A multivariate model based on orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was then created to differentiate the compound profiles from the crude extracts, the protein incubation samples and the control samples. In both types of NP experiments, there was distinct separation of three sample groups, indicating that the composition of compounds associated with the NP complex was substantially deviated from that in the crude extract and the control (Fig. 1B). We then applied multiple criteria to select putative ligands specifically enriched in the EBOV NP or MARV NP complexes which include: 1) variable influence on projection (VIP) score > 1.0, representing compounds most implicated in the difference between the NP complex and control2728; 2) average S/N value > 2.0 and RSD < 30%, indicating significant change of peak intensity of the compound in the protein complex relative to control1920; 3) matching the accurate mass of a putative ligand to the TCM compound database for Chinese licorice (see details in Experimental). Using this set of stringent criteria, we identified 30 and 22 components from the licorice extract to be candidate ligands bound to EBOV NP or MARV NP, respectively (Fig. 1C, Table S1).",

Identification of these compounds in the NP incubation sample and the control was based on matching both retention time (<0.1 min shift) and accurate mass (<0.01 Da deviation) to the reference. By this means, eleven features corresponding to 13 licorice constituents (containing two pairs of isomers) were identified.

High-resolution MS and MSMS spectra were acquired on GC7/10 and GC13 in the protein incubation sample to support structural elucidation (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, for the two diostereo-isomers, it is GC7 not GC10 that is the positive binder of EBOV NP and MARV NP with medium \u03bcM affinity. GC13 was also verified to be a ligand of both NPs yet with very weak affinity (>1 mM) (Table 1).

The N-terminal truncation construct of EBOV NP (residues 36\u2013351) used in our study entails the folded core domain which stays as an RNA-free, monomeric form in solution31. However, addition of GC7 to the EBOV NP solution shifted the monomer to much larger molecular weight species as shown by size-exclusion chromatography with in-line multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) (Table 3). Increased molar excess of GC7 eventually produced super-large complexes of EBOV NP. This ligand-bound EBOV NP core region gave rise to a monodispersed peak eluting in the void volume of SEC that closely resembled the peak of another construct 1\u2013450 well characterized to form large homo-oligomeric complexes1112 (Supplemental Figure S3). These results indicated GC7 shifted the equilibrium of EBOV NP towards the native oligomeric state of NPs. Notably, addition of the structural enantiomer GC10 converted a small portion of the monomeric EBOV NP to oligomers. In contrast, GC13 and another licorice constituent GC2 had very little effect in mediating oligomerization of EBOV NP (Table 3). The MARV NP truncation construct (residues 19\u2013370) used in our study formed a mixed population of monomer, tetramer and large oligomer in solution. Interestingly, binding of GC7 to our MARV NP disrupted its tetramer conformation and increased the fraction of monomers in a dose-dependent way (Table 3). On the contrary, incubation of MARV NP with GC13 largely promoted tetramer formation (>2-fold increase) whereas reducing the fraction of monomers. GC10 and GC2 did not induce significant changes in the monomer and oligomer distribution of MARV NP (Table 3).",

We prepared EBOV NP mutants harboring alanine substitution at K160 and R298 to examine ligand binding capacity using our affinity MS approach. Compared to the wild-type protein, mutation at K160 resulted in nearly 40% loss of binding of both GC7 and GC13, and mutation at R298 reduced binding efficiency of two ligands to a less extent (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the predicted binding free energy for GC7 (\u22125.88 kcal/mol) is much lower than that for GC10 (\u22122.75 kcal/mol), which provides the molecular basis for selective binding of one diostereo-isomer GC7 to the protein target. Furthermore, whereas the binding of GC7 strongly induced oligomerization of the wild-type EBOV NP, less obvious shift of the oligomeric state with the same ligand was observed for mutant K160A (Fig. 5B,C).",

The bacterial RNA co-purified with the protein was removed by collecting the monomer fraction eluted from SEC using high-salt buffer (1.5 M NaCl) (Supplemental Figure S4A). Subsequent dilution to the low-salt condition (200 mM NaCl) triggered spontaneous NP oligomerization confirmed by SEC analysis (Supplemental Figure S4B). The resulting oligomeric RNA-free EBOV NP 36\u2013450 readily binds to an 18 nucleotide ssRNA with low micromolar affinity (~5 \u03bcM) measured by fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 6A). Next a competitive binding assay was conducted by first incubating the monomer of EBOV NP 36\u2013450 with GC7 at various concentrations before diluting the mixture and adding the RNA probe. GC7 incubation with the NP monomer caused protein oligomerization. Importantly, this ligand when bound to the NP oligomer was found to compete with ssRNA for interaction with NP complexes. Increasing GC7 concentration during incubation resulted in a proportional loss of ssRNA from the RNA-NP complex, yielding a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ~160 \u03bcM (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that the new ligand GC7 disrupts the interaction of EBOV NP with viral ssRNA through either directly occluding the RNA-binding cleft or inducing a conformational change of NP oligomers that would impair ssRNA association.",

They were identified from Chinese licorice by combining affinity MS and metabolomic techniques. Traditionally, ultrafiltration-HPLC was employed for ligand discovery from natural product or medicinal plant extracts15293536. Most previous studies used HPLC coupled to a UV/vis detector to search for compounds that are enriched in the protein incubation with natural product extracts, and then applied mass spectrometry analysis to structural identification of these potential ligands. However, limited sensitivity of the UV/vis detector substantially lowers the chance of capturing medium to low abundant species in the complex crude extracts. In comparison to dozens of peaks typically observed in the ultrafiltration-HPLC chromatograms293536, the HRMS-based metabolomic workflow enables detection of over 1500 features in our NP incubation sample with the licorice extract. Quantitative comparison and OPLS-DA analysis of these features allowed us to evaluate binding capability of the majority of constituents in Chinese licorice. At the end, 30 and 22 components were identified to be putative ligands bound to EBOV NP or MARV NP using this new workflow. Simultaneous MSMS analysis in the metabolomic experiment facilitates structural identification of putative ligands. Using the available reference compounds, structures of two ligands were unambiguously determined.",

            "text": "GC7 (18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid) and GC13 (licochalcone A) represent the first chemical ligands reported to partake in interaction with filovirus NPs. Accompanying biophysical analyses demonstrate that GC7 binding impairs the thermal stability of EBOV NP core domain, triggers protein oligomerization, and disrupts viral RNA association with oligomeric NP complexes. Prior to our study the only documented ligand to EBOV NP is a peptide derived from EBOV VP35 which is a protein component of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRP)1112. Notably, this VP35 N-terminal peptide can maintain NP in a non-oligomeric and RNA-free state (NP0), yet it cannot support viral RNA synthesis in trans. Thus the previous work on VP35 peptide chaperoning the NP assembly granted a model where Ebola VP35 peptide binding to NP prevents NP from associating with noncognate RNA (i.e., cellular and non-genomic viral RNA)12. Furthermore, VP35 is speculated to facilitate transfer of the monomeric and template-free NP to the viral template RNA to initiate RNA synthesis11. By contrast, the chemical ligand GC7 discovered in our study exerts an effect opposite to the VP35 peptide which is to induce formation of large oligomeric complexes of the NP core domain (Fig. 5B, Table 3). This result reminded us of nucleozin, a chemical compound targeting influenza A NP that can induce the formation of NP aggregates and antagonize its nuclear accumulation, leading to cessation of viral replication in vitro9. Another chemical RK424 which disrupts viral RNA-induced oligomerization of influenza A NP, also showed potent antiviral activity against many different subtypes of influenza A virus in vitro and in vivo10. However, no compounds capable of influencing the NP oligomeric state have been discovered towards Ebola virus up to date. As the NP protein is an integral part of the viral nucleocapsid and is intimately associated with the viral RNA template, its oligomeric state is particularly important for maintaining template integrity and providing template access to the viral RDRP11. The ability of GC7 to disrupt ssRNA association with NP complexes further indicates this ligand upon binding to the RNA-free NP monomer may induce a significant conformational change of the resulting oligomers that they no longer interact with viral ssRNA as effectively as the native NP oligomers. Therefore, whether GC7 and its derivatives have any pharmacological activity on Ebola virus life cycle would be a very intriguing question to address in the future.",

Importantly, these residues comprising the GC7/GC13-binding site are well conserved across the whole filovirus family (Fig. 4B) and known to play essential roles in encapsidation of the viral genome and EBOV proliferation31383940, which sheds light on antiviral drug development. Considering the strong homology of the core domain between EBOV NP and MARV NP, we would speculate GC7 and GC13 might interact with the RNA-binding groove of MARV NP in a similar fashion. It is noteworthy that GC7 exhibits much less influence on the thermal stability and oligomerization state of MARV NP compared to EBOV NP, probably because the protein was purified in a mixed form of monomer, tetramer and oligomer (Table 3). In addition, lack of protein structural data for MARV NP renders it more difficult to predict ligand binding mode. Therefore, further structural and biochemical study of the NP-ligand complex is needed to definitively identify the precise interaction mode.",

            "text": "GC7 (18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid) is in fact the bio-transformed metabolite of glycyrrhizin by intestinal flora in the human body. Glycyrrhizin is a well-characterized major component of Chinese licorice and possesses a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities24. Glycyrrhizin in line with glycyrrhetinic acid have been developed in China and Japan as an anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antiallergic drug for liver disease treatment24. It is of our particular notion that glycyrrhizin was reported to inhibit the replication of SARS-associated coranovirus and Hepatitis C virus373839. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin exerts antiviral effects in H5N1 influenza A virus-infected cells by inhibiting virus replication and pro-inflammatory gene expression40. Interestingly, although glycyrrhizin (i.e. GC6) is an abundant constituent of Chinese licorice, we did not observe its direct binding to EBOV NP or MARV NP in the crude extract or the compound mixture screens (Figs 1 and 3), nor did it show any influence on NP thermal stability (Table 2). Our results clearly indicate that it is GC7, the primary metabolite of glycyrrhizin, that targets viral NPs directly and exhibits multiple biological activities against EBOV NP. These findings would shed new light on our understanding of the antiviral mechanism of Chinese licorice. Given the structural diversity and novelty of numerous compounds in natural products and traditional Chinese medicine, our study presents a promising new approach to mine the great resource of natural herbs for ligand discovery towards therapeutic targets and thus aid potential drug development.",

Incubation samples of a total volume of 50 \u03bcL were prepared in the corresponding NP buffer described earlier, and maintained at 16 \u00b0C for 30 min. Ultrafiltration and complex dissociation were then conducted, and the resulting compound mixture or the specific ligand was analyzed by LC-HRMS using the same instrument as described earlier. The LC method for licorice extract analysis was also applied for compound mixture screens. In specific ligand binding assays, a short LC gradient from 2% to 80% B over the first 4 min and then kept at 80% B for 2 min was applied. The protein-free control was prepared using the buffer substitute for NPs and underwent the same process as the protein incubation sample. Each incubation sample and the corresponding control was prepared and analyzed in triplicate.",
