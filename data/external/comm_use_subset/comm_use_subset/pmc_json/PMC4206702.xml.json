As such, researchers are continually developing more sophisticated epidemiological models to better understand how disease control resources can be applied more cost-effectively across the large population of cattle herds [2-4]. Cattle movements have received particular attention in recent years both because of their central role in the epidemiology of many economically important cattle diseases [5-7] and because the movements of individual cattle have been explicitly recorded in databases across the European Union since 1998 [8]. The latter has provided researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to study the dynamics of directly transmissible infectious diseases. Using network analysis based approaches, it has been consistently shown that targeting control measures at the small number of herds or movements that are highly connected in the trade network can lead to significantly greater reductions in disease prevalence than targeting the same number of herds or movements at random [9-12].",

            "text": "From a practical perspective, these findings must be interpreted with some caution as most models assume that purchased cattle all carry the same risk of generating disease outbreaks in the destination herd. As numerous empirical studies have shown, the probability of any individual animal being infected or transmitting disease to susceptible cattle is strongly influenced by factors such as age, production type, and on-farm management practices [13-16]. For example, contagious mastitis pathogens are highly unlikely to spread through the movements of male cattle or store calves purchased for fattening, whereas older lactating dams are predicted to have a significantly increased risk based on the higher prevalence of disease and greater opportunity to spread disease through contaminated milking equipment [17,18]. Identifying cattle movements that are associated with the greatest risk of infectious disease transmission has important implications for refining future epidemiological models and disease control strategies. In this analysis, we use data on bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) in Scotland as a case example to illustrate that not all cows in the movement network are epidemiologically equal.",

During acute outbreaks, cattle infected with BVDV may exhibit non-specific clinical signs of depression, inappetence, fever, and diarrhoea leading to transient declines in milk production, growth performance, and animal fertility [22]. More serious complications arise when BVDV crosses the placental barrier in pregnant cattle. Foetal infections have been associated with early embryonic death, abortions, stillbirths, congenital abnormalities, and the development of persistent infections in calves that gain immunotolerance to BVDV through vertical transmission of the virus during early gestation [23]. Persistently infected (PI) calves shed large quantities of virus for life and are primarily responsible for sustaining disease transmission at the population level [24]. Due to underlying immunosuppression and the development of fatal mucosal disease, few PI cattle survive beyond three years of age [25,26]. However, those that appear clinically normal are at risk of being sold to other herds as store cattle or breeding replacements leading to the exposure of pregnant dams in the gestational risk period for generating additional PI calves [27-29].",

While most published studies agree that maintaining an open breeding herd is the primary risk factor for disease introductions [31-35], there are likely specific cohorts of purchased cattle that are at increased risk of generating outbreaks in the destination herd. For example, the probability that any given batch of purchased cattle will contain at least one PI animal is expected to decrease with age given the higher observed mortality rates amongst PI calves [25,36]. However, older animals purchased as replacement breeding cattle have a greater probability of being directly co-mingled with susceptible breeding dams than animals purchased as yearling heifers. Seropositive dams that are pregnant at the time of purchase carry the additional risk of introducing BVDV through the birth of PI calves [37], particularly since there are few reliable prenatal tests to determine the BVDV status of the foetus [38-40].",

Second, a dynamic within-herd simulation model is used to determine whether the observed trends could be explained by the known epidemiological features of BVDV infections in cattle as well as the demographic structure of Scottish herds at the time when the different types of purchased replacement breeding cattle are typically introduced. Third, the network betweenness centrality score (a frequently used measure of the potential for herds to acquire and transmit disease through movement networks) was calculated for each source herd that supplied replacement breeding cattle to determine whether contact network structure also contributed to the differential risk associated with the different types of replacement breeding cattle movements.",

Betweenness centrality measures the number of times the shortest paths between any two farms in the network pass through a particular farm [55]. In previous theoretical simulation studies, it has been shown that farms with high betweenness centrality scores have a statistically higher probability of acquiring disease and spreading disease due to their connectivity with other farms in the network [10,56].

To our knowledge, only one other published study to date has used CTS records in this manner [13] and this represents a significant advance in developing more realistic models of BVDV transmission dynamics.

Given that the majority of farmers in Scotland do not routinely screen cattle at the time of purchase [59], it is unlikely that calves are tested after birth to identify and remove PIs [60,61]. Similar concerns are present for dams that are purchased with a calf at foot, especially if they are introduced to the herd at the start of the breeding season when a large number of dams are in the gestational risk period for generating PI calves. We would expect that older dams are less likely to be PI and more likely to be immune from previous exposure, which may partly explain why the purchase of pregnant cows with a calf at foot was not a significant risk factor for seropositivity in beef herds. Interestingly, the purchase of any type of pregnant cattle was not a significant risk factor for BVDV seropositivity in dairy herds. One possible explanation is that dairy calves are removed from their dams within 24 h of birth and either sold directly to fattening units for beef production or raised in separate production units on the farm. Therefore, even if a pregnant replacement dam gives birth to a PI calf, there are fewer opportunities for disease to spread to susceptible breeding cattle. There may also be underlying differences in the management practices and within-herd transmission dynamics of source herds supplying pregnant replacement dairy cattle that reduce the risk of these animals carrying PI calves.",

            "text": "In contrast, the purchase of open heifers and open breeding cattle in general was a significant risk factor for seropositivity in dairy herds, but not for beef herds. One possible explanation is that beef heifers were purchased at a much younger age than dairy heifers and under certain circumstances, it has been shown that exposing susceptible heifers to PI cattle can be beneficial in inducing protective immunity to prevent future transient BVDV infections during early gestation [52]. Most open dairy heifers were introduced to the herd closer to the average age at first calving for the dairy industry and may have been more likely to be commingled with susceptible breeding cattle. Based on findings from the within-herd simulation model, there are also likely differences in the herd demographic structure (i.e. percentage of dams in the gestational risk period for generating PI calves) at the time when these particular types of replacement breeding cattle were introduced that influence the risk of BVDV subsequently spreading through the herd. A previous investigation into the management practices of the herds examined in our study showed significant differences in the basic level of biosecurity that beef and dairy herds adopted for purchased cattle [59]. However, the survey questions were simple binary response variables and it was not possible to assess whether the biosecurity measures were applied differently across the various types of replacement breeding cattle. This highlights the need for more basic research into understanding how these heterogeneities in herd management impact the both the within-herd and between-herd transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases.",

Herds that are actively infected with BVDV may need to purchase additional replacement breeding animals to compensate for the negative effects on fertility, reproductive performance, and mortality (due to mucosal disease and immunosuppression) [62-64]. As highlighted by Lindberg and Alenius [65], purchasing susceptible breeding replacement cattle may contribute to the persistence of BVDV in these herds if these animals become infected during gestation. This could be an important consideration for national control programmes that focus primarily on preventing infected animals from entering susceptible breeding herds.",

Herds that sold pregnant replacement beef heifers and open beef cows with a calf at foot had higher median betweenness centrality scores than herds that sold other types of cattle, which may indicate an increased likelihood that they were infected with BVDV. In short it is possible that it is not the type of replacement animal per se that matters, but could be the connectedness of herds to others that tend to transfer that particular type of animal. A recent study from Sweden found that herds with large ingoing infection chains (another measure which accounts for both the number and connectivity of source herds for purchased cattle) were significantly more likely to be seropositive for bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus than more isolated herds [66]. With the limitations of the small study sample, it was not possible to investigate whether herds that sold replacement breeding cattle were more likely to be seropositive for BVDV and whether placing increased biosecurity restrictions on herds that sell replacement breeding cattle would be a more cost-effective control strategy. These questions may be answered in the near future as more comprehensive surveillance data from the recently launched Scottish BVD Eradication Scheme becomes available [67]. We also did not assess the potential for BVDV to spread between cattle at livestock market sales, which may be another important mechanism of disease transmission in the Scottish cattle industry.",

This applies to the testing for BVDV antibodies in bulk milk and interpretation of the test is made more confused by the fact that currently most dairy herds in Scotland buy in replacement heifers. Such factors probably explain our observation that the trends in movement and network risks associated with purchased replacement breeding cattle were less clear for dairy herds than for beef herds [68,69]. Although we intentionally excluded herds that reported using BVDV vaccines, we recognize that the simple question of \u201cDo you routinely vaccinate your herd for BVD?\u201d does not allow for variation in the number of cattle vaccinated, the use of different vaccination strategies for different management groups, and the past use of vaccinations in the breeding herd, all of which may result in the presence of antibody positive cattle in the absence of an active BVDV infection. In a previously published analysis of these data [59], we also found evidence that local transmission mechanisms may be relatively more important for dairy herds than for beef herds, which may further weaken the associations between recent cattle movements and BVDV seropositivity in dairy herds.",

For example, it was not possible to distinguish heifers that were purchased as store cattle for fattening from those that were purchased as replacement breeding animals, but culled prior to calving. This may have underestimated the number of herds that purchased replacement breeding cattle as well as the potential risk associated with purchasing open heifers. Additional bias may have been introduced to the empirical risk factor analysis through the exclusion of farms that could be linked to a valid CPH code through their reported address. However, we believe this is unlikely to have impacted the main study findings since there is no obvious reason why the unmatched farms would have a higher prevalence of BVDV.
