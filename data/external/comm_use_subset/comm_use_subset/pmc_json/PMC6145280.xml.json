Viruses from the genus Cyclovirus have been found in humans and chimpanzees.2 Circoviruses have a wide host range, including human,2, 3 birds,4, 5 pigs,6, 7 dogs,8 and cattle.9, 10 Before to 2015, porcine circovirus 1 (PCV1) and PCV2 were considered the only types of porcine circoviruses. PCV1 is nonpathogenic to pigs and was identified in the porcine kidney cell line PK\u201015.6, 11 PCV2 is associated with significant clinical signs such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine circovirus\u2010associated diseases (PCVAD), and immunosuppression.2, 6, 10 In the late 1990s, the first PCV2 outbreak was identified12, 13 and soon PCV2 became endemic causing severe economic losses in the swine industry. Its high evolutionary rate, the highest recorded for a single\u2010stranded DNA virus until now, could allow an evolutionary dynamics similar to that of single\u2010stranded RNA viruses.13 The genotype identification of PCV2 was first proposed by the European project in 2008 based on p\u2010distance of neighbor joining (NJ) trees.14 However, it was questioned by Franzo et al. and others12, 15, 16 when more sequences became available. Until now, there are three major confirmed genotypes including: PCV2a, PCV2b, and PCV2d, and two genotypes with low prevalence, PCV2c and PCV2e.16, 17, 18, 19 Genotype shifts may be associated with differences in pathogenicity and vaccine immunity.12 New standard methods to define PCV2 genotypes are necessary to adapt vaccines to the rapid emergence of new genotypes.20\n",

Recently, a novel circovirus was identified by next generation sequence (NGS) analysis of aborted fetuses of sows and named PCV3.21, 22 The newly discovered virus was associated with PDNS.23 PCV3 infection might contribute to PDNS and reproductive failure, cardiac, and multisystemic inflammation.10, 21, 24 It has also been shown that PCV3 found in aborted fetuses is the result of vertical transmission.21 Like PCV2, there are two major open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of PCV3: ORF1 encodes proteins involved in viral replication (Rep) and ORF2 encodes a major structural protein, the capsid protein (Cap).25 PCV3 sequences were detected widely in the USA,21 China,26, 27, 28 Brazil,29 Thailand,30 Korea,23 and many European countries,22, 31, 32, 33, 34 including Poland, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Germany, the UK among others. The PCV3 that was first identified in the USA was more closely related to canine circovirus although with weak bootstrap support.21 Subsequently, with PCV3 detected in China and other countries, a study reported that it was closely related to some bat circoviruses.24 Additionally, it was considered that canine CVs and some bat CVs may share a common ancestor within the cluster containing PCV1 and PCV2.35 Previous studies on the origin of PCV3 are difficult to interpret and compare since different phylogenetic methods and reference sequences were applied.21, 24, 26\n",

Additionally, all available complete PCV3 sequences deposited in GenBank until November 2017 were analyzed by NJ, ML, and MCMC methods to study the molecular genetic relationship. Our results provide a global view of the origin, genetic divergence, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 and indicate positive selection and high evolutionary rate, supporting the ongoing genotype shift and outbreaks.",

To trace the origin of PCV3, a ML tree (Figure\n\n1\na) was reconstructed using ORF1 gene sequences. We found that all the PCV3 strains were closely related to the clade 1 bat CVs (which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013) with a high confidence (bootstrap = 86). The bat virus Rhinolophus ferrumequinum circovirus 1 from China (JQ814849) acted as an outgroup of the clade 1 bat CVs and the PCV3 strains, indicating a potential bat CV origin. Additionally, we also found that the PCV2 and PCV1 strains were closely related to the clade 2 bat CVs in the study of Wu et al.35 We also discovered that canine CVs are closely related to clade 2 bat CVs and PCV1 and PCV2 strains. However, it was previously reported that canine CVs were closely related to PCV3 strains when comparing complete genomes, although with low bootstrap values.21 This supports the idea that the conserved Rep protein should be used when inferring the origin of porcine circoviruses in the future. Furthermore, the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstructed with 81 of the 101 ORF1 sequences (Figure 1b) showed similar topology with the ML tree, and evidenced a close relationship with clade 1 bat CVs with uncertain divergence time due to the insufficient numbers of sequences currently available (Table S1, Supporting Information).",

Interestingly, detailed analysis of the distribution of the sequences in the distinct clades revealed that the sequence structures were similar using the different algorithms, except for several branches in one clade (PCV3\u2010China/GX2016\u20103, PCV3\u2010China/GX2016\u20102, PCV3/CN/Guangdong\u2010HY1, PCV3\u2010China/GX2016\u20101, PCV3\u2010US/MN, PCV3/CN/Jiangxi\u2010B1, PCV3/KU\u20101609, PCV3/KU\u20101608, 2164, PCV3\u2010CHN/GD). Considering the stable structures of the complete coding sequences, we named them clades PCV3a and PCV3b, respectively. The PCV3a clade included the strains first identified in the USA in 2015 (PCV3\u2010US/MO/2015).21 Moreover, the PCV3a clade could be separated into two individual subclades with stable structures, termed PCV3a\u20101 and PCV3a\u20102.

As mentioned before, site 24 of PCV3a and PCV3b was different and, as seen in Figure 5, the epitope structures of PCV3a and PCV3b are different.

We determined, with better accuracy than previous reports, the origin of PCV3 and proposed an evolutionary pathway that led to the emergence of PCV3 worldwide. First, we used conserved coding sequences (ORF1) to trace the potential origin, which was a better and more accurate approach than those previously applied to complete genomes.21, 24, 26 We found that clade 1 bat CVs which were isolated in China from 2011 to 2013 shared the most recent common ancestor with PCV3. Interestingly, we found several differences with previous reports. First, the pig NW2/USA/2009 strain clustered with the PCV3 clade, which was previously reported to sit as a sole outgroup in the phylogeny.24 Therefore, we assume that the emergence of PCV3 was before its first detection in 2009 in pigs. However, the accurate origin and divergence time need deep epidemiological surveys to be confirmed. Second, compared to previous studies,21, 24, 26 more reference sequences were included and we confirmed that PCV3 actually diversified from a clade 1 bat CVs.35 Furthermore, in accordance with a previous study, we found that PCV1 and PCV2 were closely related to the clade 2 Bat CVs,35 but not birds.13 Overall, clade 1 bat CVs are the most likely origin of PCV3 based on the currently available sequences. Generally, bats are considered to be important reservoirs of novel emerging infectious diseases. Circovirus host jumps may be a risk for both the pig industry and public health, similar to the recently reported bat\u2010origin coronavirus detected in pigs.39, 40\n",

Additionally, within the PCV3a clade, two stable subclades and flexible IM clades were identified. Compared to previous studies,24, 31 the topologies of the trees provided here, deduced using complete coding sequences, were more stable and accurate (Figure S4, Supporting Information). On the other hand, amino acid analysis revealed that S122A and A320V were vital in differentiating the PCV3a and PCV3b clades. Although genotype identification combined with amino acid analysis has been reported by Fu et al.24 and Fux et al.,31 it is essential to note that: i) both studies included the low sequencing quality strain KY418606 (which has been revised after the two studies were published), misleading the topology of the phylogeny; ii) the subgenotype identification of the two studies was not based on full genomes, while complete coding sequences were used here; and iii) the stable topologies observed in our phylogenetic trees reconstructed with complete coding sequences were confirmed by principle component analysis (PCA) using different sequences in one of our unpublished studies. Therefore, accurate phylogenetic trees and genotype identification of PCV3 should be deduced using unrooted ML trees of complete coding sequences in the future.",

We believe that the short divergence time identified for PCV3a and PCV3b is due to a lack of adequate number of PCV3 sequences. The skyline plot revealed a rapid increase and expansion of the PCV3 population from late 2013 to early 2014. In addition, during this period, PCV3a and PCV3b were formed. The initial phase of an epidemic is usually associated with exponential growth (corresponding to Re = R0). Re must always be less than or equal to R0 by definition. If the value of R0 or Re is more than one, an epidemic may occur.43 We estimated that the Re of PCV3a and 3b were 3.18 (CI: 0.82\u20137.96) and 1.82 (CI: 0.63\u20134.86) in 2016, respectively. Additionally, the high substitution rate of PCV2 within single stranded DNA virus, enabled it to experience an evolutionary dynamics similar to single stranded RNA viruses and, therefore, enhanced the global emergence of PCVD.13 Interestingly, the substitution rate of PCV3 was relatively higher than PCV2, which might facilitate PCV3 to adapt to different biological conditions and pose a greater threat to the swine population. Overall, these estimated results were consistent with the actual epidemic of PCV3 and indicate that both PCV3a and 3b have high potential for widespread transmission in the future. Thus, epidemiological investigation to prevent this novel disease is crucial. Moreover, our analysis revealed epidemiological features associated with the geographical distribution in China, which might indicate that once PCV3 strains establish into specific areas, they might adapt to the local hosts. Importantly, amino acid site 24 of the ORF2 protein (codon of 320 in the complete coding region) was predicted as a potential epitope and to be under positive selection. This site may be pivotal to the escape of PCV3 from the host immune system leading to a prolonged period of circulation and the divergence of the PCV3a to the PCV3b clade.44\n",
