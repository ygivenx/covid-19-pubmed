Activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the development and progression of kidney and heart disease. In the classic RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II, which mediates its adverse effects via the angiotensin type 1 receptor [3]. RAS blockade is recommended as first-line therapy in patients with kidney disease to improve outcomes [4], but as kidney and cardiac disease continue to progress, new therapeutic approaches are needed.",

Increasing evidence suggests that the relative balance between the deleterious ACE/Ang II pathway and the protective ACE2/Ang 1\u20137 pathway is an important determinant of tissue injury. In kidney disease secondary to subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), kidney ACE and Ang II are increased [9\u201313] and kidney ACE2 activity is decreased [12, 14]. These findings have led to strategies to replenish ACE2 using recombinant ACE2 or to activate ACE2 using compounds such as diminazene aceturate (DIZE) [15]. Both approaches have beneficial effects on the kidney in experimental kidney disease. Recombinant human ACE2 prevented Ang II induced kidney disease and tubulointerstitial fibrosis [16] and slowed the progression of diabetic nephropathy through a reduction in renal Ang II and increased Ang 1\u20137 levels [17]. DIZE had reno-protective effects after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury through enhancement of antioxidant activity [18], and we reported that short-term DIZE decreased kidney cortical ACE activity and ameliorated the reduction in kidney ACE2 expression and activity in STNx rats [13].",

            "text": "Kidney disease is also associated with activation of the cardiac RAS and cardiac damage. We previously reported that STNx rats have increased cardiac ACE activity and adverse cardiac remodelling despite elevations in cardiac ACE2 activity [19, 20]. We also showed that ramipril lowered blood pressure and inhibited cardiac ACE activity, and that these changes were associated with a reduction in LVH and cardiac ACE2 activity [19]. In the current paper, we hypothesised that DIZE which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats. Full cardiac hemodynamic data was available in a subset of rats from our previously published study [13] along with cardiac tissue. Therefore, the focus of this paper was to investigate the effect of short-term DIZE on cardiac structure and function, cardiac ACE/ACE2 gene expression/activity and cardiac angiotensin peptide (Ang II/Ang 1\u20137) levels in STNx rats with an activated RAS and in Control rats with a balanced RAS. In addition, we assessed gene expression of cardiac ADAM17 [21], a proteinase that is responsible for the cleavage or \u201cshedding\u201d of the catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 from the cell membrane.",

There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1\u20137 levels with DIZE.

In vivo, the effect of DIZE on cardiac ACE2 contrasts with our previous results where the cardiac benefits of ACE inhibition were associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and ACE2 [13]. The finding that DIZE was associated with down regulation of ADAM17 mRNA led us to speculate that DIZE may have indirect effects to maintain cardiac ACE2 activity levels and thus reduce cardiac Ang II, through reduced cleavage of ACE2 from cardiac cells. This hypothesis would be consistent with reports that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ADAM17 prevented shedding of ACE2, whilst exogenous infusion of Ang II increased myocardial ADAM17 expression and decreased myocardial ACE2 activity [33]. Future studies should address not only ADAM17 gene expression but also ADAM17 protein content.",

Thus, by contrast to its effects in the pathological state of kidney failure, DIZE had no effect on cardiac ACE/ACE2 activity, cardiac Ang peptides or ADAM17 in Control rats with a balanced RAS and normal blood pressure and kidney function. We have previously shown that short-term DIZE significantly reduced kidney cortical ACE activity and ameliorated the reduction in cortical and medullary ACE2 activity in STNx rats with kidney RAS imbalance, but had no effect on kidney ACE2 expression or activity in Control rats with a balanced RAS [13]. Further support for this concept comes from studies of DIZE after myocardial infarction (MI) which is also associated with imbalance of the cardiac RAS [22]. A 4-week s.c infusion of DIZE in MI in rats improved cardiac remodelling, significantly increased cardiac ACE2 mRNA and activity and reduced cardiac ACE mRNA and activity\u2013these effects were blocked by concurrent use of the ACE2 inhibitor, C16 [22]. In hypercholesterolemic mice on a wild-type or ACE2 deficient background with Ang II induced abdominal aortic aneurysms [34], 4-weeks of intramuscular DIZE (30mg/kg) increased kidney ACE2 mRNA and activity in wild-type mice, and reduced the incidence and severity of Ang II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms. However DIZE had no effect in ACE2-deficient mice which does suggest that it acts through an ACE2-dependent mechanism [34].",

Kulemina et al first reported the off target effects of DIZE to activate ACE2 [15] and described a biphasic dose\u2013response curve; DIZE activated ACE2 at low concentrations and partially inhibited ACE2 at high concentrations. Incubation of human rACE2 with DIZE (100\u03bcM) increased ACE2 activity in some studies [23], but others have shown that DIZE did not increase the enzymatic activity of mouse or human rACE2 [35]. We reported that DIZE had no effect ex vivo to alter kidney ACE2 activity, but was associated with increased kidney ACE2 activity in vivo in STNx rats [13]. The ex vivo studies in cardiac membranes of STNx and control rats in the current study showed no direct effect of DIZE to increase ACE2 activity. Taken together, the reported effects of DIZE on ACE2 activity vary according to whether the study was in vivo or ex vivo, and may depend on the underlying pathophysiology, route of administration or the tissue used to assess ACE2 activity. In order to delineate if the mechanism of action of DIZE is specifically related to ACE2 activation, future studies should examine the effect of co-administration of DIZE with specific ACE2 inhibitors such as MLN 4760 (C16) to help establish or exclude if the observed beneficial cardiac effects of DIZE are truly ACE2 dependent.",

The ex vivo studies in cardiac membranes showed no direct effect of DIZE to inhibit ACE, which is consistent with the work of others that DIZE had no effect on the catalytic activity of ACE [15].",

The benefits of DIZE were associated with a shift in the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II and no change in cardiac ACE2 activity. Cardiac Ang 1\u20137 levels were not changed with DIZE suggesting that its main effects are related to reduced Ang II. We have previously reported in STNx, that improved cardiac structure and function was associated with reduced cardiac ACE2 activity, and the finding that cardiac ACE2 remained unchanged with DIZE may reflect reduced cardiac ACE2 shedding secondary to downregulation of cardiac ADAM17. Further studies are now warranted to determine if the observed beneficial cardiac effects of DIZE are due to reduced ACE2 shedding from the cell membrane, or are specifically related to ACE2 activation.",
