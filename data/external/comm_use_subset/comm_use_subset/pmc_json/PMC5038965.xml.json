To date, at least 90 types of coronavirus have been isolated or genome-identified from humans and a wide variety of animals, including domestic animals, wild birds and bats. Bats are particularly notable in this respect because they are known to harbor a diverse range of pathogens, and are known to be the reservoir hosts of both human coronavirus 229E [11] and SARS-CoV [12], and are closely related to MERS-CoV [13, 14]. As a consequence bats have been prioritized for the surveillance of emerging zoonotic diseases [15\u201317].",

Gaps within the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 were closed, and the complete genome sequence confirmed, using Sanger sequencing. Finally, the 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-ends of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome were obtained using 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 RACE (Fig 1).",

Comparative genomic sequence analysis indicated that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was most closely related to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains [18] with 66.6% - 67.4% nucleotide identities. Similarly, Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 displayed equivalent genomic characteristics to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 except for an inserted gene at 3\u2019 end (discussed in detail in the next section). The major open reading frames (ORFs) had the identical order, namely 5\u2019- replicase ORF1ab\u2014spike (S)\u2014NS3\u2014envelope (E)\u2014membrane (M)\u2014nucleocapsid (N) followed by the accessory genes encoding nonstructural proteins (NSPs) (Fig 1 and Table 1), although the N gene was truncated. Amino acid sequence analyses showed that the ORF1ab, S, NS3, E, M and N proteins of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 shared higher identities with Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains than those of other betacoronaviruses (Table 1). Also of note was that the 3\u2019-end of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome, just downstream of N gene, possessed a much more complicated structure than those of other members in the genus. Clearly, there were four NSP-encoding ORFs. According to the convention, the second-to-fourth ORFs were temporarily named NS7a, NS7b and NS7c, respectively, since they shared 29% - 53% amino acid identities with the accessory genes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains and other related bat coronaviruses (S1 Table). Perhaps the most striking feature of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome was the presence of a small intact ORF with 276 bases embedded between the N and NS7a genes. Although this ORF that had no homology to any known coronavirus, the encoded protein exhibited 30% - 54.9% amino acid identity with the p10 protein encoded by the first ORF of segment S1 of avian and bat fusogenic orthoreoviruses [20], which are double-stranded segmented RNA viruses belonging to the family Reoviridae. Therefore, this ORF was provisionally marked as p10 according to the molar weight of protein that it encodes (Fig 1).",

Comprehensive information on the size and genomic locations of nsp1 to nsp16 and the putative cleavage sites of proteinases is presented in Table 2. Previous studies indicated that the P1 position of 3CLpro specific cleavage site is exclusively occupied by a glutamine (Q) residue [22, 23]. However, nucleobase 12642 in the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 genome was a T nucleotide, thereby changing glutamine (Q) to histidine (H). More interestingly, there were no glutamine codons in the sequence (from -273 to +192) around this site, as also observed in the corresponding site in the genomes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9. Therefore, the LH|AG region may represent a potential alternative cleavage site of 3CLpro to cleave between NSP9 and NSP10. A similar phenomenon may occur at the cleavage site between NSP10 and NSP12 of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, where the CAG codon has mutated to CAC causing the conversion of Q to H in amino acid sequence (Table 2).",

However, a strikingly different phylogenetic pattern was observed in the distinctive p10 protein (Fig 3), in which the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 sequences were clearly related to bat (Pteropine) originated orthoreoviruses. Although the branch leading to the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 sequences is long, these viruses are clearly more closely related to the bat-origin than avian-origin orthoreoviruses (Fig 3), matching the host species from which Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was isolated.",

Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the PCR products were intact fragments of the expected length. The amplicons were cloned for sequencing. As shown in Fig 4A, the sequence obtained covers, without interruption, the partial N gene, the whole p10 gene and partial NS7a gene (data in the S2 File).

To determine if the bat, which sample was collected from, was likely the natural host of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, subgenomic mRNAs in the sample were probed with a comprehensive set of primers. The PCR products were confirmed on an agarose gel. As displayed in Fig 6C, the lowest band marked with a red arrow on each lane was the specific amplicon from each subgenomic mRNA as demonstrated in Fig 6B. However, additional amplified bands were also compatible with this inference. As shown as an example on the lane of the E gene, the upper band indicates that subgenomic mRNA NS3 was simultaneously amplified in this reaction. On each lane the lowest band was cloned for sequencing, while other bands were purified and sequenced directly. Since the specific amplicon of the subgenomic mRNA NS7c failed to be cloned into the vectors, the PCR product was used as template for a second round of nested PCR. The product was then confirmed as shown in the lane of NS7c-2 in Fig 6C, and the band was cloned for sequencing. The results (Fig 6D and S3 Fig) indicated that the core sequence of the leader and body TRS of each gene, the leader-body fusion sites, and the mode of generation of subgenomic mRNAs were consistent with the prediction and demonstration in Fig 6B, especially the p10 gene and its subgenomic mRNA. Therefore, the existence of subgenomic mRNA in the samples further proved that the p10 gene was an intact authentic gene in the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1.",

For this purpose, the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was transiently expressed in BHK-21 cells as well as the p10 gene of Pulau virus, which was used as a positive control. Wright-Giemsa and immunofluorescence staining showed that both genes had the same function to induce the formation of cell syncytia (Fig 8A and 8B and S4A Fig).

Therefore, an artificial plasmid was constructed containing the transcribed p10 subgenomic mRNA, which confirmed the functional expression of p10 (Fig 8C). When the plasmid was transfected into BHK-21 cells, once again, cell syncytia were observed with Wright-Giemsa and immunofluorescence staining (Fig 8D and S4B Fig).

However, it is also possible that coronaviruses are one of the few virus families that can experience heterologous recombination. For example, members of betacoronavirus group A possess an HE gene [30, 31] which was seemingly derived from ancestral influenza C virus, a negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome [30, 31], and which would represent another case of inter-family recombination, although it has also been proposed that the HE gene might be captured from host RNA [32]. Uncommon inter-family recombination events have also been reported in chicken infectious anemia virus [33], bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 [34], and recombinant viruses between Marek\u2019s disease virus, fowlpox virus, and various avian retroviruses [35, 36]. In the current study, sequence, phylogenetic and functional analyses demonstrated that the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was likely derived from an ancestral orthoreovirus, although that it occupies a divergent position in the phylogeny suggests that the direct ancestor of the recombination event has yet to be sampled. Hence, these data provide clear evidence for a putative inter-family recombination between a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a double-stranded segmented RNA virus. The mechanisms that underpin such inter-family heterologous recombination clear merit further investigation.",

To date, the FAST family comprises six members including p10 proteins encoded by avian- and bat-origin orthoreoviruses, p13, p14 and p15 encoded by broome virus, reptilian reovirus and bush viper reovirus and baboon orthoreovirus respectively, and p16 and p22 encoded by aquareoviruses.

Previous studies of the potential recombination between coronavirus and influenza C virus revealed the pivotal role of the shared HE gene for the pathogenesis of betacoronavirus group A [38].

            "text": "Compared to nonfusogenic orthoreoviurses, fusogenic orthoreoviruses can cause severe pneumonia when infecting humans [40, 41], further implying that p10 is an important pathogenic determinant. Thus, the recombination of the reovirus-originated p10 into the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 may enable the novel virus to disseminate and replicate rapidly in the host, in turn leading to severe infections. In recent years, several coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have caused severe pneumonia among humans [42, 43]. Because of the presence of human infected fusogenic orthoreoviruses such as Melaka virus (MelV) [44], there is obviously some risk that cross-family recombination events such as that described here may generate a novel coronavirus with altered pathogenicity. Our study therefore highlights the importance of investigating the mechanisms that might enable possible recombination between human coronaviruses and orthoreoviruses.",

As NSP12 is a typical RNA polymerase and the core of replication-transcription complexes (RTC) and NSP10 usually serves as a molecular switch that can interact with multiple NSPs to form complexes, the replication ability of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 might be suppressed by the decrease of release of these vital elements. It is also interesting to note that a similar situation may be observed at the NSP13/NSP14 cleavage sites of replicase polyprotein of human coronavirus HKU1 and human coronavirus NL63. Clearly, further investigation will need to focus on the isolation of the virus, construction of infectious clones, and the virulence and replication ability of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 influenced by knockout of p10 gene and/or reverse mutation of cleavage sites.",

Previous studies showed the existence of p10-harboring orthoreoviruses in bat populations [40, 47\u201349], such that co-infections with bat coronaviruses and hence recombination events are clearly possible. In addition, a previous study reported that mammalian orthoreovirus, a type of nonfusogenic orthoreovirus, was isolated from a SARS-CoV patient along during the in 2003 outbreak [50]. We believe that future studies should investigate co-infections in specific bat cell lines using a coronavirus similar to Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 or Ro-BatCoV HKU9 and the relevant orthoreoviruses, from which it will be possible to reveal more of the underlying basis of heterologous coronavirus recombination.",
