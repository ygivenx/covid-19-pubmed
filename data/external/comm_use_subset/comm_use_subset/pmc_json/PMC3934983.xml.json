            "text": "\nParamyxovirinae is a large virus subfamily that contains 9 known human pathogens: measles virus, mumps virus, human parainfluenza viruses type 1 (hPIV1), 2, 3 and 4, Menangle virus, and the recently emerged, highly pathogenic Nipah and Hendra viruses [1]. Paramyxovirinae encode multiple proteins from the phosphoprotein (P) gene transcription unit, including P, V, and C. In almost all Paramyxovirinae, the P gene mRNA is edited, resulting in the expression of at least two proteins, P and V, which share an identical N-terminus (PNT), but have a unique C-terminus (Figure 1A) (for a review, see [2]). In addition, several genera, including Morbilliviruses, Henipaviruses, and Respiroviruses, encode a third protein, C, within their P gene, from an overlapping reading frame [2]. The C proteins are expressed by a variety of mechanisms including: leaky scanning [3]\u2013[5], non-AUG start codons [6], [7], ribosomal shunting [8], and proteolytic processing [9]. The region of P that overlaps C, corresponding approximately to PNT (Figure 1A), is disordered [10]\u2013[13], and contains conserved sequence motifs, such as soyuz1, found in all Paramyxovirinae, which binds the viral nucleoprotein, and soyuz2, of unknown function [14].",

            "text": "The two primary functions of the C proteins are their abilities to regulate viral transcription/replication and to antagonize the antiviral responses of the host. These functions are thought to be interconnected, since a decrease in viral transcription/replication often correlates with a decrease in the innate antiviral responses of the host [15]\u2013[18] (for a review, see [19]). Most paramyxoviral C proteins inhibit viral RNA synthesis, and thereby presumably regulate viral gene expression [20]\u2013[24]. However, they differ in the degree to which they block host antiviral responses [25]. These responses are composed of two crucial signaling cascades: A) Induction of type I interferon (IFN), following recognition of virus-derived elements by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and B) IFN signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to transcription of antiviral effector genes [26], [27].",

            "text": "Most paramyxoviral C proteins can inhibit IFN induction, but only respiroviruses are known to inhibit IFN signaling. Morbillivirus C proteins have two mechanisms to counteract IFN induction: 1) by reducing levels of viral replication, which limits the production of viral patterns recognized by PRRs and prevents them from inducing IFN [17], [21], [28]; and 2) by inhibiting IFN transcription in the nucleus [29], [30]. An initial study reported that measles virus C protein blocks IFN signaling [31], but subsequent studies indicated that this effect is not significant [17], [32], [33]. Similarly, although the mechanistic details are less clear, Henipavirus C proteins block IFN induction by decreasing viral RNA synthesis, which indirectly inhibits type I IFN induction; but they have minimal effects on IFN signaling [15], [34]\u2013[37]. Like the morbilliviruses, Respirovirus C proteins also counteract IFN induction through two mechanisms: 1) by minimizing production of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), thereby avoiding PRR activation [16], [38]; and 2) by inhibiting IRF3-dependent induction of type I IFN [39]. However, the C proteins of respiroviruses differ from those of Morbilliviruses and Henipaviruses in being also able to inhibit IFN signaling [16], [26], [38]\u2013[53]. Finally, a new role has been reported recently for the C proteins of respiroviruses: they regulate the levels of viral genomes and antigenomes produced during infection [54].",

Indeed, overlapping genes are thought to arise by overprinting, a process in which mutations within an existing (\u201cancestral\u201d) protein-coding reading frame allow the expression of a second reading frame (the de novo frame), while preserving the expression of the first frame [65]\u2013[67]. De novo proteins have been little studied but are known to play an important role in viral pathogenicity [68], [69], for instance by neutralizing the host interferon response [70] or the RNA interference pathway [71]. In addition, de novo proteins characterised so far have previously unknown 3D structural folds [68], [71], [72] and novel mechanisms of action [71]. Thus, this class of proteins may challenge the notion that nature only utilizes a limited number of different protein folds and that this fold space is well mapped [73], [74]. Another particularly interesting feature of overlapping genes is the evolutionary paradox they present, since the overlap imposes sequence constraints which should restrict the ability of the virus to adapt [75]\u2013[81].",

Briefly, a sequence profile is a representation of a multiple alignment that contains information about which amino acids (aas) are \u201ctolerated\u201d at each position of the alignment, and with what probability. Comparing profiles is much more sensitive than comparing single sequences, because the profiles contain information about how the sequences can diverge and thus can identify weak similarities which remain after both sequences have diverged [99], [109], [110].",

This high similarity could in theory result either from convergent evolution or from homologous descent. The fact that the measles and Nipah groups are phylogenetically related [105], and that their C proteins are encoded in the same genomic location makes homologous descent a much more likely explanation. On the other hand, HHalign did not detect any similarity between the C proteins of the Sendai group and those of the measles and Nipah groups. Thus, either they are not homologous, despite their similar organization, or they are homologous but have diverged in sequence beyond recognition. The latter scenario is possible, in theory, since the relative frame of C compared to P (+1) is the same in the Sendai group and in the measles/Nipah groups (Figure 1A).",

In contrast, the C proteins of the Nipah group contains two additional, conserved regions (Figure 3): 1) a short N-terminus with \u03b1-helical potential (\u03b10, aa 2\u201319 in Nipah virus), containing a hydrophobic region followed by a basic region (boxed in Figure 3); and 2) a short region at the C-terminus of \u03b11 (aa 74\u201383 in Nipah virus) that contains two conserved acidic positions (E/D). The apparent conservation of other regions of C, which overlap the soyuz1 and soyuz2 motifs of the P frame (Figure 3), should not be over-interpreted, since it may be due to constraints imposed by selection pressures acting in fact on the P frame, which is much more conserved than the C frame in these regions (not shown).",

In Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus 1 (hPIV1), as many as four products (C\u2019, C, Y1, Y2) are expressed from the C reading frame by a combination of alternative initiation codons [6]\u2013[8] and proteolytic processing [9]. Their respective N-termini are indicated by arrows. The C proteins of the Sendai group have a similar organization to that of the measles and Nipah groups. They are composed of a variable, disordered N-terminus of about 80aa, rich in Prolines (P), Serines (S) and Threonines (T), followed by a conserved C-terminus composed of four \u03b1-helices (\u03b1A to \u03b1D). The N-terminus contains a basic region (boxed in Figure 4) within a predicted \u03b1-helix (\u03b1Z), like the C protein of the Nipah group (Figure 3). In the C protein of Sendai virus, the first half of \u03b1Z was reported to act as a membrane-targeting signal, perhaps by forming an amphipathic \u03b1-helix [111]. There are 11 residues strictly conserved in C across the Sendai group, clustered predominantly in the C-terminus of \u03b1C and in \u03b1D. \u03b1C is particularly rich in K and R (\u201cbasic region 2\u201d in Figure 4), suggesting it might bind a negatively charged partner.",

PNT contains sequences that bind the protein STAT1 in several morbilliviruses (measles virus\n[55], [56], canine distemper virus\n[57], Rinderpest virus\n[60]) and henipaviruses (Nipah virus\n[58] and Hendra virus\n[59]). The region of PNT that contains these sites is highly variable in sequence (Figure 7), and thus its alignment is not reliable. In contrast, the overlapping region of C is well conserved, and its alignment reliable (Figure 5). Therefore, we used the C frame to construct a reliable alignment of PNT. We proceeded in two steps (see Methods). First, we used the amino acid alignment of the C proteins (Figure 8, top panel) to generate an alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the P/C gene (Figure 8, middle panel and File S2), using TranslatorX [89]. Second, we translated this nucleotide alignment into an amino acid alignment in the P frame (Figure 8, bottom panel). The resulting alignment of PNT of the measles and Nipah groups is presented in Figure 9.",

In a comparison of a temperature-sensitive strain of measles vaccine, AIK-C, with its parental strain, Edmonston [114], one of several substitutions identified, S134Y, occurs in the S/T\u03b14 position conserved in the measles and Nipah groups (Figures 2 and 5) (Table 2). Although this particular substitution is not responsible for the temperature sensitive phenotype [114], we note that it is located within a 12aa peptide (aa 127\u2013138) recently shown to inhibit the viral polymerase by interacting with SHCBP1 (Shc Src homology 2 domain-binding protein 1) [115]. This peptide, underlined in Figures 2 and 5, contains two other positions conserved in the measles/Nipah groups (a hydrophobic residue and E\u03b14). Such conservation suggests that other viruses in the measles/Nipah groups may also bind SHCBP1 to block the viral polymerase. Finally, the role of the disordered N-terminus of measles virus C is poorly known, although it contributes to nuclear localization, which correlates with its ability to block IFN induction [29] (Table 2).",

For both Sendai virus and hPIV3, the minimal region required for STAT1-binding corresponds to the structured, well-conserved C-terminus of C [117], [119]. Within that domain, aas 149\u2013157 (corresponding roughly to basic region 2, underlined in Figure 4) are critical for nuclear translocation of the Y1 isoform of Sendai virus C, and may also play a role in the inhibition of type-I IFN-stimulated gene expression [120]. This region contains several conserved residues, suggesting that its function may be conserved in the Sendai group. Studies of the N-terminus of C in the Sendai group indicate that it also contributes to antagonizing the innate immune response and to regulate viral transcription and replication [121], [122] (Table 2 and Table S1). Taken together, these studies suggest that both the N- and C-terminus of Sendai group C proteins may need to act in coordinated fashion in order to perform their complete suite of antagonistic and regulatory functions.",

We found that the C proteins of tupaia paramyxovirus (Tupaia PMV) and of hPIV1 were by far the best candidates, for the measles/Nipah groups and Sendai group respectively, in terms of yield and solubility (not shown). We expressed both proteins as hexahistidine-tagged N-terminal fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and purified them from the soluble fraction by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (see Methods). Mass spectrometry confirmed that the C proteins had the exact expected mass. In SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure S1), hPIV1 C migrated at a notably larger size (\u223c31kD) than expected (25.9kD), while Tupaia PMV C migrated at \u223c21kD, only slightly above the expected size (19.7kD). This anomalous migration may be caused by regions that are disordered or have a biased aa composition [123]. Accordingly, the N-terminus of both proteins is predicted disordered, and has a biased composition in the case of hPIV1 C.",

We obtained N-terminal sequences of the three most abundant fragments, of \u223c14.4, 13, and 6 kD (arrows to the right of Figure 12). They start respectively at aa 30, 43 and 84. This pattern of proteolytic digestion indicates that Tupaia PMV C is composed of a disordered N-terminus and of an ordered C-terminus. This is compatible with our predictions, in which aa 1\u201356 are devoid of secondary structure (Figure 2) and aa 1\u201342 disordered, and in which a predicted loop, \u03b11\u20132 (aa 81\u201392), could be accessible to proteolysis. The observed fragments of 14.4 and 13kD correspond exactly to C proteins where aa 1\u201329 and 1\u201343, respectively, have been digested, whereas the size of the smaller fragment (6kD) corresponds to aa 81\u2013135, indicating that the last 18 C-terminal aa are digested upon extended proteolysis.",

Thus we consider that all C proteins most probably have a common origin, as proposed earlier [67], [130]. The absence of a C protein in the mumps group is probably due to a loss in the ancestor of that group, since the Sendai group, which has a C protein, is basal in a phylogeny of the P gene [105]. This common origin would imply that in Sendai virus, it is the Y1 isoform of C that is the equivalent of C of the measles/Nipah groups, because their start codon have the same location immediately upstream of the soyuz1 motif of the P frame (Figure 6; compare also Figure 4 and Figure 3). Therefore, the C and C\u2019 proteins of Sendai virus would have presumably originated by mutations creating new, alternative start codons upstream of Y1. A common origin of Paramyxovirinae C proteins would also imply that the basic regions in the N-terminus of C have originated independently in the Sendai and Nipah groups, since they occupy different positions with respect to soyuz1 (Figure 6).",

Our analyses in this work and in an earlier study [14] suggest that the C and PNT frames were probably both present in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae, making it impossible to conclude which frame is ancestral on the basis of phylogeny. Analysis of codon usage [131] cannot determine which frame is ancestral either, because the codon usages of PNT and C are indistinguishable in Paramyxovirinae (Angelo Pavesi, personal communication). However, functional considerations suggest that the PNT frame originated earlier, since it is indispensable to viral replication in vitro\n[2], [132], unlike C [20], [133], [134]. The ancestry of PNT is supported by a comparison with families related to Paramyxovirinae (Mononegavirales). Most Mononegavirales also encode P proteins with a disordered N-terminus [14], [135]; at least in Rhabdoviridae, this N-terminus has the same function as Paramyxovirinae PNT, i.e. preventing the nucleoprotein from self-assembling illegitimately [136]\u2013[139]. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that the P of the ancestral Mononegavirales already had a disordered N-terminus, which was overprinted by C in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae.",

However, this scenario is not parsimonious because it would imply several losses in the lineages separating measles virus and Nipah virus. Also, the common 4aa stretch is chemically very different in both viruses (G117EAV in measles virus and V115YHD in Nipah virus, Figure 9).

Accordingly, a previous sequence analysis of Sendai virus indicated that PNT and C are generally not both under strong constraint [142]; rather, the N-terminus of PNT is markedly more conserved than that of C, whereas the C-terminus of PNT is markedly more conserved than that of C [142]. This is also the case for most of the PNT and C of measles and Nipah virus (Figure 13, evolutionary pattern 1 or 2), with the exception of the region corresponding to the STAT1-binding sites of PNT (see below).",

            "text": "A second key to the paradox of overlapping genes is that it may be beneficial for a virus, under certain conditions, to encode functional motifs simultaneously by using overlapping frames [147]. Initially, we were very surprised to discover that a region of the P/C gene encodes simultaneously, in different frames, two well-conserved regions: the STAT1-binding motif of PNT, and the \u03b12\u2013\u03b14 region of C (Figure 13, evolutionary pattern 3). Intuitively, this arrangement seems to dramatically restrict the capacity of the virus to mutate and to escape host defenses. We were all the more surprised that this arrangement originated twice independently, in measles virus and in Nipah virus (see Figure 6). This seems beyond coincidence, and strongly suggests that the loss of fitness of the virus due to its reduced ability to mutate is compensated by an evolutionary advantage. In fact, this phenomenon had been predicted on the basis of mathematical modeling [147]. Given a high mutation rate, it may be advantageous to encode crucial functional motifs in overlapping frames (provided that they are short), because the superposition of critical amino acids reduce the number of vulnerable positions in the genome. The conditions of application of the model are met here: RNA viruses have one of the highest mutation rate of all organisms [148], and the STAT1-binding sites are short (10\u201326aa). It will be interesting to investigate whether this evolutionary pattern, in which two reading frames are both under strong constraint, is common in viruses, and whether it does entail a selective advantage. The genome of Hepatitis B virus, for instance, also contains short regions where both the overlapping Polymerase and Glycoprotein frames are under strong constraint [149], [150]. A recent innovative methodology that combines experimental and computational approaches [151] could help to tease out the different factors (structural, functional and co-evolutionary) constraining overlapping motifs.",
