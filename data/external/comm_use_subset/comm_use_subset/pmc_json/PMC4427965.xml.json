First was the Spanish influenza in 1918 (A/H1N1); the Asian influenza occurred in 1957 (H2N2); and the Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (H3N2) [1,2]. The Swine flu pandemic occurred in 2009 (HIN1/09) [3]. Even though no public health expert can predict with certainty the timing and severity of the next outbreak, there is general agreement that future pandemics are perhaps inevitable [4].",

We use the Republic of Ghana\u2019s pandemic preparedness plan as an illustrative example. The Ghana National Integrated Strategic Plan for Pandemic Influenza for 2009 \u2013 2013 (NISPPI) is the government\u2019s paper outlining its preparedness strategies [12]. The NISPPI addresses five main themes - planning and coordination; surveillance and situation monitoring; prevention, containment and management; communication; and social mitigation. In the recent past, the plan has been critiqued for deficiencies in epidemiological content and other concerns [13,14]. Sambala criticizes the vaccine/antiviral strategies of Ghana, Malawi, and Tanzania pandemic plans as unclear and inadequate \u2013 lacking an epidemiological explanation as to why certain groups are at high risk. Norman et al. do not consider the level of risk used in estimating direct health threat in the event of an outbreak acceptable risk. They do not offer what level of risk is acceptable. Both the 2006 influenza preparedness and response plan [15] and the current NISPPI [12] contain assumptions about the direct health threat in the event of an outbreak. Both project the number of clinical cases and deaths in Ghana in the event of a Phase 5 pandemica using gross attack rates of between 15% and 40%, and case fatality rates (CFR) between 0.6% and 1.5%. Based on Ghana\u2019s present population of approximately 25 million, even these conservative assumptions show a real potential for significant mortality (22,500 deaths) in an influenza pandemic. Clinical cases will far exceed what the country\u2019s health infrastructure and sophistication can handle.",

Guidance on allocating scarce resources (vaccines, intensive care units, hospital beds, human resource allocation, and staffing) or triage systems for priority setting in providing critical care during a pandemic are absent from the plan.

The other required planning actions that are not addressed include clear indication of agencies to lead the coordination and maintenance of essential services, and designation of facilities where patients should be treated in the event of a pandemic.",

Lessons from existing guidelines and frameworks [19,20] show that effective communication among health care professionals and the public could be achieved by integrating communication aspects into all planning, preparedness and response activities.

Questions surrounding isolation, quarantine, and application of police power are relevant in this context. Even though the NISSPI mentions that quarantine and other standstill measures will be invoked immediately when the Minister declares an outbreak, the plan does not address the ethical questions associated with such interventions. Available records from Colonial Ghana amplify the need for such ethical questions to be addressed. The records indicate that social distancing methods including segregation were attempted; not only did officials close schools and ban public meetings, they also restricted the police and clerical workers from doing their duties [35]. The towns of Larwa, Tumu, and Wa in the Upper West Region of current Ghana clearly abused patients by removing them from their homes and isolating them to inhabitable huts on the fringes of the infected villages, and the larger towns and villages were completely sectioned off [36]. Food, water, and necessary supplies could only be placed outside the camps and only the attendants could come out to collect these items for the patients inside. In the northern territories and Ashanti, the Colonial administration constructed fences around infected towns, placed markets outside their borders, and directed traffic to alternative trade routes [36]. Some commentators on the subject have argued that if individuals are required to forgo certain liberties, fairness should be a prime consideration [34]. Nowhere in the NISPPI is this issue addressed.",

            "text": "The NISSPI provides no guidance to address the ethical issue of health care worker duty to care in pandemic circumstance. Every pandemic plan should address the question of whether practitioners are obligated to treat patients with a highly contagious disease, thus putting themselves and their families, acquaintances, or anyone else they contact at risk. For example, research publications have mentioned the high transmissibility to nurses and frontline physicians in Southeast Asia during the SARS outbreak [37,38]. Wenzel et al. report that about 50% of those who died from SARS were healthcare workers who had come in contact with infected patients in hospitals [38]. Chua et al. recorded that fear and anxiety-induced psychiatric morbidity was a major problem among healthcare workers involved in SARS treatment [39]. Drawing from these experiences, others have warned that an influenza pandemic will impose similar foreseeable risks to physicians and other healthcare workers [40]. This raises an ethical dilemma about the extent of the professional duty of caregivers during a pandemic versus the limits to health risk to themselves and to their families that healthcare workers need accept [41]. It may be argued that if provided with the appropriate equipment or supplies necessary to treat, practitioners should be obligated to treat someone with any illness. The NISPPI mentions procuring and distributing protective clothing, masks, aprons, and gloves. This is laudable; however, being prepared requires not only that health workers are aware that they have masks that they can use during a pandemic but also that they have the requisite training on how to use personal protective equipment safely and effectively. Indeed, it is required of planners to acknowledge limitations of various proposed actions or interventions (both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) [42]. The NISPPI does not address these issues.",

However, each of these five themes -- planning and coordination; surveillance and situation monitoring; prevention, containment and management; communication; and social mitigation \u2013 are infused with ethical issues. Unfortunately, NISPPI does not attend to these issues as it plans in relation to the themes. We recommend that the Ghana Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Health and their partners incorporate ethics into their pandemic preparedness efforts. This could be done by introducing a running sixth theme on ethics. This ethics theme could be applied more systematically to the five categories - acting as a lens on the other five categories. Seeking public input and consultation with ethicists during plan development or revisions will prove useful in addressing these deficiencies.",

We especially flag planning actions that contribute to equity, social justice, and respect for vulnerable groups as important. Preparedness decision-making could be made deliberative and all-inclusive through public and stakeholder input and consultation with ethicists. Adequate public and stakeholder engagement would ensure that the stockpiling and allocation of resources are sensitive to locale-specific competing demands. The plan must address special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and institute measures to ensure that responses to threat are proportional and measured.",

First, given the volatility of the local public health, somewhat time-fixed plans may exist alongside other national or sub-national guidelines undergoing constant revisions. Such guidelines, if they do exist, did not form part of this analysis. The second limitation relates to the fact that the quality of ethical argumentation in preparedness plans and actual amount of attention ethics will receive in an influenza pandemic are distinct. Though an important indicator of her sensitivity to ethics, the quality or otherwise of emphasis to ethics in the NISPPI is one among many elements. We note therefore that our analysis of plans is an incomplete but important assessment of the ethics sensitivity of Ghana\u2019s preparedness for influenza pandemic.",

Lack of guidelines to ensure fair allocation of scarce resources during a pandemic, failure to justify proposals for procuring and stockpiling pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies, and failure to justify delineated preparedness actions are deficiencies. Until the deficiencies are recognized and addressed, Ghana runs the risk of rolling out unjust and ethically indefensible actions with real negative effects on people in the event of a pandemic threat.
