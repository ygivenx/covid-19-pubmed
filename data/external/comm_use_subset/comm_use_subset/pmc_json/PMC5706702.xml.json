            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized as widespread reproductive failures in pregnant sow, including mummified, stillborn and aborted fetuses, as well as respiratory distress in all age pigs. Since it first emerged in the United States in late 1980s, as a \u201cmystery\u201d disease, PRRS had spread to most pig raising area of the world, which badly hinders the development of global pork industry [1\u20134]. The causative agent, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae and genus Arterivirus, with the prototype virus Equine Arterivirus (EAV) and two other members, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (HSFV), with single-strand positive-sense RNA as genome and envelop at the outside of the virus [5]. Two major identified genotypes of PRRSV, initially circling in the Europe (genotype 1) and North American (genotype 2), were found to surprisingly genetically divergent, which have approximately ~40% nucleotide sequence difference, however these two genotypes present similar genomic organization, clinical symptoms, and temporal emergence [6]. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that these two types virus origin from the same ancestor, and processing a period independent evolution before the outbreak on the two continents [7]. Recently many countries have both genotypes\u2019 strains emerged in the field, which increases the complexity of PRRSV diagnosis and prevention [8\u201310].",

ORF1a and ORF1b occupied more than 70% of genome at the 5\u2019 end, encode the replication-related pp1a and pp1ab, together with two ribosomal frame-shift (RFS) products pp1a-nsp2N, pp1a-nsp2TF, which are autoproteolytically cleaved into at least 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) associated with virus replication and transcription [5, 12]. Among them, three important virus proteases, nsp1 (papain-like cysteine protease), nsp2 (chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) and nsp4 (3C-like serine protease) in pp1a are associated with PRRSV nsp cleavage. And four crucial enzymes for PRRSV RNA synthesis, including nsp9 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp), nsp10 (RNA helicase), nsp11 (endoribonuclease) and nsp12 (functions unclear) are encoded by ORF1b [13]. The viral structural proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7, which involve in receptor binding, virus entry and neutralizing antibody elicitation etc., are individually expressed by a set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) [14\u201316].",

            "text": "Nsp11 protein contains a highly conserved nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) domain unique for viruses in the order Nidovirales [17]. This domain resides in the C-terminal region of nsp11, showing a distant relationship with the XendoU family from Xenopus laevis [18\u201320]. The newly identified crystal structure suggests that the PRRSV nsp11 exists as an asymmetric dimmer [21], which differs from the hexametric structure of coronaviruses nsp15 [22, 23]. Based on previous mutation analysis study on EAV, the NendoU should be required for genome replication and particularly on sgRNA synthesis [18]. As well, nsp11 plays an important role associated with the suppression of type I IFN induction [24], the RNAi innate immune response [25] and the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated productions of IL-1\u03b2 [26]. Together with nsp1\u03b2, nsp11 is also responsible for different expression level of TNF-\u03b1, induced by PRRSV strains with different pathogenicity [27]. However, the characterization of nsp11 immunogenicity remains unclear. Whether the nsp11 could induce humoral immune response in PRRSV infected pigs, or if there is any B-cell epitope on nsp11, are worth to investigate.",

This novel epitope was found to be conserved in both genotype strains, but not among other Arterivirus. The localization of this epitope on the surface of nsp11 makes it easy to induce immune responds during PRRSV infection. Therefore, B-cell epitope identification and characterizing the immunogenicity of PRRSV nsp11 does not only extend our understanding of the structure-function relationships and nonstructural protein induced immune response, it also indicates the potential possibility of applying nsp11 specific mAb for viral-host protein interaction research and diagnostic testing.",

Considering many mechanisms of its pathogenesis, replication and immune regulation are unclear, even now, the PRRSV is still a mystery virus. The nonstructural proteins play amounts of essential biological roles in viral replication and/ or host immune response regulation by virus-host interaction. Among them, PRRSV nsp11 with the NendoU domain presents its necessary for viral genome replication and contributes to inhibiting host innate immunity through its endoribonuclease and deubiquitination activity. However, the immunogenicity and immune structure of PRRSV nsp11 has not been clear yet. In this study, the expressed His-tagged nsp11 recombinant protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice for mAb preparation and the mAb 3F9 belonging to a subclass IgG1/\u03ba-type was successfully identified. Further, the mAb 3F9 specifically binding epitope with the exact core unit 111DCREY115 was also successfully identified.",

Depending on the conservation or variation of these epitopes among different kind of PRRSV strains, their specific mAbs can be used as tools for differentiating the two genotype strains or HP-PRRSV from classic PRRSV strains [33, 34]. Here, the core unit 111DCREY115 was found to be conserved in both genotypes of PRRSV, but not in Arterivirus. Only three residues \u201cREY\u201d at 113-115aa were conserved in PRRSV, LDV and HSFV [21]. However, due to lacking other Arterivirus in our lab, the cross-activity of 3F9 mAb with other members of Arterivirus was not carried out this time.",

Among this core unit, the residue C112 was regarded to interact with residue R153 from another subunit, which might be important for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between monomers and supporting the formation of stable dimers [21]. So it is very interesting, weather this antibody could interrupt the function of PRRSV nsp11 by interrupting the dimers formation, if it has been overexpressed in PRRSV infected cells. Further, the 3D structural visualization shown that this epitope presents at the surface of nsp11 [21]. This characterization makes this epitope easy to explore and induce host immune response in infected animals, which was confirmed by serological test using PRRSV positive sera. Together with its conversation between two genotype virus, this nsp11 B-cell epitope could be a good target for both serological and pathogen detection.",
