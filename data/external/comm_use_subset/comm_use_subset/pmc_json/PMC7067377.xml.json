A 2013 study [2] found that 59% of U.S. adults had looked for health information on the Web in the previous year and that about one in three U.S. adults use the Internet to figure out what medical condition they have. The fruition of news sources, either traditional such as television, radio and newspapers, or digital such as Web news or online social networks, has become crucial in how health information is delivered and it can play a fundamental role in shaping opinions, awareness and behaviours. In the past ten years, several studies have addressed the impact of awareness and information spread during epidemic outbreaks and it has been reported that the degree of public attention and concern induced by an epidemic threat might affect the disease transmission dynamics [3\u20137]. However, modeling efforts have been mostly theoretical and a large-scale empirical characterization of the adoption of health protective behaviours, either induced by information spread or media exposure, and its interplay with the disease dynamics during an epidemic outbreak has been elusive so far due to the lack of available data [8].",

Infection is mostly asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms [9] but it can lead to serious and sometimes fatal neurological defects in neonates born to ZIKV infected women. In particular, following the association between ZIKV and a cluster of microcephaly cases in Brazil [10], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ZIKV epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on February 1st, 2016 [11]. The emergency lasted until November 18th 2016, when the WHO declared the PHEIC to be over [12]. As of March 2017, ZIKV has spread worldwide to 79 countries where there has been evidence of an ongoing vector-borne virus transmission. The most affected region has been the American continent with 47 countries or territories reporting local ZIKV transmission, due to the extensive presence of Aedes mosquitoes in almost all the region\u2019s countries [13]. In such epidemiological context, the ZIKV epidemic has posed peculiar communication challenges to the public due to its association with microcephaly in newborns, its transmission modalities, and its prevalence in areas where the virus was never detected before and that was suddenly characterized by intense international travel due to the 2016 Summer Olympics [13\u201315].",

The novelty of the disease and the lack of previous knowledge of it in the affected areas make the 2016 ZIKV epidemic an ideal case study to characterize collective attention patterns, identify their drivers and test traditional modeling assumptions. Intuitively, mass media coverage represents the main driver of public attention during an epidemic. Indeed, several peculiarities of media narratives around public health hazards [18] and infectious diseases [19] have been elucidated, but a general and quantitative comprehension of how the public opinion responds to media exposure during an emerging epidemic threat is still lacking. The majority of modeling studies assume that media exposure is driving behavioural changes, hence media exposure effects are incorporated into some kind of media function that modulates individual behaviors and may affect disease dynamics [20\u201322]. The general assumption is that as the number of cases increases and is reported by mass media, the susceptibility of individuals will decrease due to increasing awareness and the associated behavioral changes [21]. However, for most disease outbreaks, such modeling assumptions have never been supported by direct empirical evidence.",

Accesses to Wikipedia pages represent a signal of information seeking behavior, defined as the deliberate process in which individuals actively aim to acquire new knowledge by searching for information on a specific topic [23]. In our study, we considered such indicator to be a proxy for measuring the collective attention to the outbreak. Specifically, we considered the daily pageview counts on 128 different Zika-related Wikipedia articles (96 languages) in the U.S. to be an unambiguous indicator of collective attention to the epidemic. We investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of pageviews in relation to the timeline of ZIKV incidence reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and in relation to the coverage of the ZIKV epidemic by local and national media sources. In particular, we focused on news coverage of the ZIKV epidemic by online media and television in 2016, available in digital format through the GDELT project and the Internet Archive (see Methods for a full description of the data under study).",

Such spikes of attention visibly correspond to similar spikes in the media coverage profiles, both in the TV coverage of the epidemic (Fig 1B) and in the Web news coverage of Zika (Fig 1C). The three time series are indeed highly correlated, with a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient r = 0.74, (p < 10\u22124), for the Wikipedia pageviews and the Web news time series, and r = 0.80, (p < 10\u22124), for the Wikipedia attention and the TV coverage (see S2 Table in the Supporting Information).",

            "text": "On the contrary, while the profile of Wikipedia pageviews shows a temporal pattern that is very similar to the one displayed by mentions of Zika in media outlets, the temporal profile of the disease incidence is qualitatively very different. The number of new ZIKV cases in the United States reported by the CDC every week (Fig 1D) gradually increased from the beginning of 2016 until the summer, with a peak between the end of August and the beginning of September. Notifications of new cases declined afterwards. Summer 2016 was also characterized by the first reports of local ZIKV transmission in Florida and in Texas, events that were also responsible for an increased news coverage of Zika. However, the surge of reported ZIKV cases in the United States did not result in an increased level of attention with respect to the initial spike observed at the beginning of the outbreak. The epidemic profile is indeed not correlated with the timeline of Wikipedia pageviews (r = \u22120.15, p = 0.26) or the media coverage profiles (r = 0.04, p = 0.80 for TV and r = 0.10, p = 0.47, for Web news). Such dynamics of public attention can be ascribed to the initial novelty of the outbreak, which was presented as a novel and serious health threat even in the presence of a small number of imported cases. As the extension of the outbreak and the associated risks became clearer to the public, the interest of Americans in looking for additional information on Wikipedia faded over the course of the year, with relatively smaller increments linked to important events such as the Olympics. Such observation is consistent with the presence of a memory effect in the dynamics of Wikipedia pageviews: individuals retain information for some time before their attention toward a topic is elicited again by novel events or anniversaries [24, 25].",

Although the relative risk of case importation and local transmission varied significantly from state to state, being the Southern States more at risk due to vector\u2019s presence and abundance [26], the Wikipedia pageview timelines were all highly correlated, as shown in Fig 2. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the cross-correlation matrix of Wikipedia pageview time series by State ranges from r = 0.77 (p < 10\u22124) for Delaware and Montana, to r = 0.99 (p < 10\u22124) for New York and New Jersey. Overall, the correlation of the Wikipedia pageviews in each state with the national timeline was always higher than r = 0.88 (p < 10\u22124), indicating a high degree of spatial uniformity across the country. Given the above mentioned correlation of Wikipedia pageviews with the TV coverage of the epidemic and the mentions of Zika on the Web, the attention patterns at State level were also highly correlated with the national media coverage suggesting a fundamental role of news exposure as a driver of public attention at all geographic scales.",

We tested these hypotheses by comparing Wikipedia pageview counts in each state to Web news mentioning the word \u201cZika\u201d and the name of the state, and to the local ZIKV incidence profiles. Attention profiles in each state were generally positively correlated to Web news mentioning the name of the state, however the degree of correlation ranged from r = 0.004 (p = 0.98) in Wisconsin to r = 0.75 (p < 10\u22124) in Texas, showing significant spatial differences across the country (see S3 Table in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, ZIKV incidence in each state could explain such geographic variations as a negative driver of attention. On the one hand, local patterns of attention in each state were generally not correlated with disease incidence, with the exception of Montana (r = 0.33, p = 0.02), as shown in S4 Table of the Supporting Information. On the other hand, Web news covering Zika in each state were positively correlated with the local incidence profiles (r > 0.20) only in 13 states out of 50 (see S5 Table in the Supporting Information) and, at the same time, these states showed the smallest degree of correlation between news and attention. A direct comparison of the 50 states ranked by degree of correlation between news and ZIKV incidence, and between news and attention, showed a negative rank correlation: weighted Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 = \u22120.25 [27]. Overall, in those states where local news were following more closely the local epidemic patterns, the dynamics of public attention was not driven much by news. Instead, local attention patterns followed more closely the state news where the latter was more similar to the national one and less correlated with the local ZIKV epidemiology.",

To answer this question, we examined the attention to ZIKV in 788 cities of the United States with a population larger than 40,000 and compared it to their total Wikipedia viewership. By ranking the U.S. cities based on their total volume of Wikipedia pageviews in 2016, and comparing such ranking with the one based on pageviews of Zika-related articles only, we identified locations where the attention to ZIKV was higher than expected. As shown in Fig 3A, cities on the East Coast of Florida showed the highest relative attention to ZIKV, when compared to their overall Wikipedia activity. Other relevant outliers with high attention were cities in Texas and in the Northeast. On the contrary, the lowest attention to ZIKV was observed in cities in California, and in the Midwest (Fig 3B). These results suggest that increases in public attention at city level may be explained by risk perception due to the presence of the vector (as in Florida and Texas). However, the high level of attention in other places, such as Union City, NJ, can not be easily explained by epidemiological risk factors and it may be due to specific events, such as one or more case importations, that do not appear in our dataset.",

Since our goal is uncovering drivers of collective attention, rather than achieving optimal prediction of the empirical time series, we choose an equal-time modeling approach over standard time series modeling techniques (e.g., autoregressive models). More specifically, we start with a linear regression model that predicts population-rescaled pageview counts for a given week and a given state using only national Web news and TV data for the same week. We focus on 43 states with population in excess of 1 million, comprising more than 98% of the U.S. population according to 2016 United States Census Bureau estimates [30].",

Despite its simplicity, this equal-time linear regression demonstrates that both media signals, taken independently, are already quite informative of the Zika population-rescaled pageview time series: using exclusively TV close captions we obtain R2 = 0.61 and r = 0.80, while using only Web news we obtain R2 = 0.52 and r = 0.78. Combining both features, the linear model achieves R2 = 0.63 and r = 0.82. Similar results are obtained when considering the Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 as a measure of performance (see Table 1). As model performance is evaluated via state-wise cross-validation, these results highlight that national-level media signals are highly informative of state-level pageview time series, once they are rescaled to take into account population size. As a reference, we compare the results obtained with media features with an equal-time linear regression informed only by the epidemiological signal, that is the ZIKV incidence in each state.

While previous studies have focused on newspaper coverage of epidemics [36], we investigated the relationship between the exposure to TV coverage and online news, and the attention to Wikipedia pages. Our study confirms the high sensitivity of Wikipedia searches to breaking news and official announcements, in particular in the case of disaster events, as found by previous studies [37, 38]. On the other hand, the temporal dynamics of Wikipedia pageviews during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic showed a nonlinear dependence with media coverage: the Wikipedia pages activity was high in the initial phases of the outbreak, but it declined more quickly than media coverage. This can be explained by the fact that information on Wikipedia is rather static, and users will view Wikipedia pages immediately after the news breaks but they will not return in the next days, unless more recent events renew their attention [37].",

In general, media coverage was influenced by several factors, and only to a lesser extent by the progression of the epidemic. Although from a journalist\u2019s perspective, it may be expected that news did not necessarily follow the number of ZIKV cases, such result highlight the limitations of several behavioral epidemic models that incorporate media effects. Indeed, choices made by journalists regarding newsworthiness of specific aspects related to ZIKV infection affected the level of knowledge and familiarity in the US population [39]. Also, the media narrative around ZIKV evolved over time, as found in a recent study by Yotam Ophir [40]. The content of the ZIKV news coverage shifted from focusing on scientific themes, at the beginning of the outbreak, to the description of social disruptions during the Summer Olympics. Since we did not examine the textual content of news items in our dataset, further research should identify specific themes emerging from media outlets that are most significantly associated to Wikipedia viewership during epidemic outbreaks. Also, we relied on the automatic tagging system provided by GDELT to identify news items mentioning Zika. However, the classification algorithm may have limitations and some items could be less relevant than others. Further research should assess the quality of the GDELT news tagging algorithm in the specific case of epidemic outbreaks [41]. Another limitation of our analysis is that we considered the content of mass media outlets only, and did not look into other news sources, such as online social networks. However, social media often provide an amplification channel for traditional media sources and online users consume information that is not very different from what appears on mass meda [42].",

Recently, Wikipedia pageview data have been increasingly used by researchers in epidemiology and infectious disease modeling [50, 51]. The overall value of Wikipedia data to measure and forecast the dynamics of infectious diseases has been debated [52] and, in general, Wikipedia-based forecasting models have been proved successful in the case of endemic or seasonal diseases, such as influenza, dengue or tubercolosis [51]. On the other hand, our study demonstrates that Wikipedia page viewership can provide a temporally resolved measure of collective attention during epidemic outbreaks caused by novel emerging diseases, at a high spatial granularity. Previous works have investigated the effects of external events on the activity of Wikipedia editors and on the number of pageviews [53, 54]. More generally, the characterization of the usage of Wikipedia as a source of information and as a proxy for measuring the global attention to real-world events has been studied [24, 38, 55, 56]. The results of our study add further evidence of the value of Wikipedia data in the field of digital epidemiology, especially for capturing information seeking behavior, and attention patterns during disease outbreaks [57].",

Time series analysed in our study report the number of news items citing Zika that appeared each day in 2016. Multiple mentions of the word \u201cZika\u201d in the same article are not counted, therefore we consider the volume of individual articles mentioning Zika. Metadata associated to each news item allow to select only news mentioning a specific geographic entity beyond the United States, such as States or counties.

By K-fold (k = 10) and leave-one-out cross validation, we test the performance of the model considering different linear combinations of features Xi. Specifically, we considered as model features the weekly media timelines Y(w), where Y = TV, Web or Webstate, and Webstate, and Webstate represents the selection of Web news mentioning only a specific state name together with the word \u201cZika\u201d. We also consider as a reference the case Y(w) = ZIKVs(w), where ZIKVs(w) is the weekly number of reported ZIKV cases in state s. To take into account the saturation effect due to media exposure, we also considered an exponentially decaying function of the media timelines Y (Y = TV, Web):\nm(Y)=\u2211\u0394t=1\u0394tmaxe-\u0394t\u03c4Y(w-\u0394t)(4)\nwhere \u03c4 is a free parameter, setting the memory time scale, and \u0394tmax is defined by the total length of the time series up to week w (\u0394tmax = w).
