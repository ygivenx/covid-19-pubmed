At first, many individuals and nations assumed that it would be contained within China due to rapid implementation of quarantine for the city of Wuhan and the remarkable construction of two hospitals in only 12 days. The zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 from wildlife to humans led to a Chinese ban on wildlife trade; however, the rapid spread of COVID-19 shows a systematic and expeditious transmission between humans [2].",

Governments have been hesitant in their response with border and school closures, bans on public gatherings, and screening of passengers at transportation hubs. The question remains whether this is truly effective. Some authorities have advocated the usage of thermal scanners to identify those who are febrile. These scanners could be used today to identify febrile individuals who will be in close contact with heads of state, government, or business. Although well-intentioned, this is imprecise for mass gatherings. As seen below, many infected, yet non-febrile individuals will be missed with such screening tools (Figure 1).",

The WHO defines a mass gathering as a \u201cconcentration of people at a specific location for a specific purpose over a set period of time which has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the country or community\u201d [3]. Examples of sporting events include the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo or the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Religious pilgrimages such as the Hajj in Islam and Lourdes in Catholicism draw millions of pilgrims every year. The triennial Kumbh Mela, the Hindu religious pilgrimage festival, can draw up to 120 million people over two months [4]. The health and safety of vulnerable populations in such events are quite challenging.",

Risk assessment, response, and surveillance are cornerstones of preparation; the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 31000 is a well-accepted approach to risk management [3]. Recent consequences of this standard have resulted in the cancellation of mass gatherings in Lourdes and the closure by Saudi Arabia of pilgrims to Umrah. It remains to be seen if the Olympics will proceed as scheduled or deferred until a later date. ",
