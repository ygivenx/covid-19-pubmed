For treatment, not only differentiation between (fungal) eumycetoma and (bacterial) actinomycetoma is important, but also the identity of the causative agent, since species differ in their response to antimicrobial drugs [4]. In endemic countries, clinical diagnosis may be the only diagnostic method. A fully developed mycetoma lesion is easily identified clinically, whereas in early stages with the absence of grains, the infection may be confused with phaeomycosis or soft tissue tumors [1]. In such cases fine needle aspiration cytology or deep surgical biopsy for histological examination are useful [1], [5]. Some fungal and bacterial grains have a characteristic histological appearance which helps in provisional identification, but recognition of the causative species remains impossible [6]. Isolation of the pathogen from discharged grains or from biopsies allows identification of agents that sporulate, but most of the species lack phenotypic characteristics [3]. Molecular techniques have been introduced to facilitate the identification of nondescript organisms [7], [8], [9], but are of high cost and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for a fast, simple and reliable method for identification.",

The probes are linear oligonucleotides that contain two target-complementary sequences at their ends joined by linkers [11]. The ends of the probe hybridize to the complementary target in juxtaposition and then ligate which allows the circularization of the probe [11]. The circular structured molecule then amplifies with DNA polymerase that has strand displacement and progressive DNA synthesis activity resulting in series of repeats of the original circular template [11], [12]. The technique has been proven to be rapid, specific and low-cost for molecular identification of viruses, bacteria, and fungi [13], [14], [15], [16]. It has been applied for identification of a rare black grain mycetoma species Exophiala jeanselmei\n[17]. In addition, RCA has been used successfully for identification of white grain mycetoma species Scedosporium boydii\n[18]. The aim of the present study is to develop RCA-based diagnostics for the most common agents of black-grain eumycetoma.",

For the remaining species (Pleosporales) an alignment was constructed to include representative isolates of the family Trematosphaeriaceae and of coelomycetes in the suborder Pleosporineae. Sequences were aligned using BioNumerics v4.61 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). Probes were designed with minimum secondary structure and were checked using PrimerSelect (DNASTAR Lasergene, WI, U.S.A.). To insure specificity of the probes, target-specific sites of each padlock probe was submitted to BLAST in NCBI sequence database for homologous sequences. The melting temperature of the 5\u2032 end of the probe binding arm was designed to be>63\u00b0C while for the 3\u2032 end binding arm it was designed to be at least 15\u00b0C below the annealing temperature. The probes were phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end and are listed in Table 2. Probe linkers were taken from Zhou et al. [23].",

The ligation appears to be highly specific and thus the method can detect single nucleotide polymorphism [30]. The amplification reaction is driven by an isothermal DNA polymerase to amplify the circularized probes with high efficiency and an estimated capacity to synsthesize more than 70,000 bp per hour [31]. RCA products can be detected with different methods including gel electrophoresis, radiolabeling, UV absorbance, fluorescence, and single molecule detection [32].

In the present study the RCA positive signal was easily visualized using both gel electrophoresis and fluorescent dye.
