To counteract cellular stress responses and to ensure efficient viral propagation, viruses manipulate cellular signalling pathways [1,2]. During infection with viruses, accumulation of newly synthesized viral glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may lead to exhaustion of the folding capacity of the ER, resulting in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) [3]. The UPR serves to maintain ER homeostasis by enhancing the folding capacity of the ER and decreasing the rate of synthesis of new proteins. Prolonged ER stress can trigger terminal UPR, resulting in apoptosis [4,5].",

Following activation, PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) and thereby diminishes translation [3].

The excision of a 26-nucleotide fragment creates an mRNA variant encoding a spliced XBP1 protein, XBP1s, which transcriptionally activates genes controlled by specific promoter sequences, for example, the unfolded protein response element (UPRE) [8]. Activation of UPREs was originally thought to depend solely on XBP1s [9]; however, it was recently found that both ATF6 and XBP1 contribute to the activation of UPRE [7]. Under non-UPR conditions, translation of XBP1u mRNA produces \u201cunspliced\u201d XBP1 (XBP1u). A translation-pausing motif in the XBP1u mRNA causes a transient pause in XBP1u translation, and the complex of the XBP1u\u2019s nascent protein chain, its own mRNA and the ribosome are recognized by the signal recognition particle and recruited to the ER membrane, where phosphorylated IRE1 mediates splicing of the XBP1u mRNA [10].",

            "text": "Marburg virus (MARV) causes outbreaks of severe, often fatal hemorrhagic fever in Central and East Africa [15]. MARV particles are composed of seven viral proteins. The single-stranded negative-sense viral RNA is complexed with the nucleoprotein NP (ribonucleoprotein complex, RNP). In MARV-infected cells, NP induces the formation of viral inclusion bodies, which are found in close association with the rough ER [16] and represent the sites of viral replication and transcription [17]. Associated with the RNP are the viral proteins L, VP35, VP24 and the viral transcription factor VP30 [18,19]. The MARV matrix protein VP40 is the driving force for viral budding [20,21]. GP is synthesized at the ER and further transported to the plasma membrane via the classical secretory pathway [22]. GP is highly glycosylated with mannose-rich and complex-type N-glycans and with mucin-type O-glycans. The majority of both the N- and O-glycans are attached to a mucin-like domain (MLD) [23]. GP plays an essential role during MARV infection of target cells by binding to the cellular receptor and mediating fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. MARV infection results in the production of large amounts of viral proteins in the cytosol. GP is translocated into the ER, where it accumulates; it is only slowly released to the Golgi and transported to the plasma membrane [22].",

The following plasmids were transfected: 1 \u00b5g (6-well format) of p5xUPRE-GL3, which encodes firefly luciferase controlled by a UPRE promoter [8,30], and 0.1 \u00b5g of a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase under the control of the SV40 early enhancer/promoter (pGL4.73, Promega) for normalization purposes. To stimulate UPRE-dependent reporter gene expression, cells were either infected with MARV (MOI = 1), treated with thapsigargin (Tg, Sigma-Aldrich, T9033) or treated with tunicamycin (Tu, Sigma-Aldrich, T7765). To analyse UPRE activation by MARV proteins, the cells were additionally transfected with pCAGGS-based plasmids encoding viral proteins. If combinations of two viral proteins were to be expressed, 0.5 \u00b5g (Figure 4(a)) or 1 \u00b5g (Figure 6(e)) of each plasmid was used. Single viral proteins were expressed by transfecting 1 \u00b5g of the appropriate plasmid (Figure 1 and Figure 4(c)). Transfection within the setting of an infectious virus-like particle assay (iVLP) was performed as described by Wenigenrath et al. [25]. The negative control samples were mock-infected and/or treated with vehicle (DMSO). Stimulation with Tg or Tu was performed 16 or 24 h before the cells were lysed. MARV infection of cells was performed at 24 h post-transfection (p.t.). The cells were lysed at 48 h p.t. or p.i. in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed using the Beetle-Juice and Renilla-Juice BIG KITs (PJK). Renilla luciferase signals were used to normalize for transfection efficiency.\n",

The expression of XBP1s is dependent on the posttranscriptional splicing of XBP1u mRNA by IRE1. It excises 26 nucleotides from the XBP1u mRNA, resulting in a frame shift. To monitor this event, we fused GFP to XBP1s. If IRE1 is silent, Flag-XBP1u is expressed. When IRE1 is activated, XBP1u mRNA splicing leads to the expression of Flag-XBP1s-GFP. Both variants can be detected by the N-terminal Flag tag; XBP1s can be visualized by GFP. To stimulate XBP1 splicing, cells were treated with Tg (5 nM) or with Tu (300 nM) for 16 h or transfected with plasmids encoding MARV proteins. The cells were analysed by Western blotting and by fluorescence microscopy (transfected cells). Eight images obtained from each of three individual experiments were quantified by counting the number of cells positive for XBP1s and mCherry or a viral protein and the percentages of GFP-positive cells were calculated (Figure 2(C)).\n",

We used a firefly luciferase-based reporter construct that contains a UPR cis-active promoter element regulated by the transcription factors XBP1s and ATF6 (p5xUPRE-GL3) [8]. Our system was calibrated using thapsigargin (Tg) or tunicamycin (Tu). Tg inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA) and thus halts the active transport of Ca2+ into the ER, leading to depletion of Ca2+ levels and UPR activation [35]. Tu blocks N-linked glycosylation, thereby interfering with protein folding, and causes UPR activation [36,37]. HuH7 cells were transfected with p5xUPRE-GL3 and a plasmid that expresses the Renilla luciferase under the control of the SV40 early enhancer/promoter (pGL4.73). The transfected cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of Tg or Tu. Treatment of the cells with either substance resulted in a concentration-dependent induction of UPRE (Figure S1). The lowest concentrations of Tg and Tu that reliably induced UPRE were 5 and 300 nM, respectively; these concentrations were used in further experiments except where otherwise indicated.",

HuH7 cells were transfected with p5xUPRE-GL3 and pGL4.73 together with plasmids encoding MARV GP, VP35 or NP or HA-tagged versions of the viral proteins. Western blot analyses confirmed the expression of the viral proteins, and no obvious differences in the levels of expression of the wild-type and HA-tagged versions were observed (Figure 1(a)). Importantly, in-gel detection of HA-tagged proteins using an antibody against HA showed that the signal strengths of GP and VP35 were similar, whereas NP appeared to be expressed in higher amounts (Figure 1(b)). The luciferase activities of the same samples corresponding to the luciferase protein that accumulated over the past 48 h of expression were analysed; the results revealed that GP reliably activated the expression of the UPRE-controlled reporter gene in contrast to NP and VP35 (Figure 1(c)).",

Deletion of the MLD specifically removes most of the glycan acceptor sites [23,38]. Western blot analyses showed that after transfection of cells with the two plasmids at identical concentrations, the expression level of GPdMLD was higher compared to that of GP although the activation of UPRE was reduced (Figure S2). Therefore, the amount of the GPdMLD plasmid used in transfection was reduced to 100 or 25 ng (Figure 1(d,e)). Transfection of 25 ng resulted in the expression of similar amounts of GPdMLD and GP proteins at 48 h after transfection (Figure 1(e)). Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of single cells expressing GP or GPdMLD revealed that the two proteins showed comparable localization patterns and signal strengths (Figure S3). Under these conditions, GPdMLD did not activate the UPRE reporter (Figure 1(d)). It is presumed that due to the reduced number of glycosylation sites in GPdMLD, the ER transit of GPdMLD occurs more rapidly than that of GP; this is likely the reason why GPdMLD-expressing cells exhibit less ER stress. Taken together, the data show that intracellular expression of MARV GP leads to activation of the UPRE.",

Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of all ectopically expressed proteins (Figure 5(a), S6a and b, input). Using anti-HA agarose to precipitate HA-tagged VP30, it was possible to co-precipitate XBP1u protein (Figure 5(a), lane 5) but not XBP1s (Figure S6a) or IRE1 (Figure S6b). VP30-GFP could also be co-precipitated with HA-tagged VP30, which was expected since MARV VP30, like EBOV VP30, is presumed to undergo homooligomerization (Figure 5(a), lane 3). Quantification of six independent experiments revealed that the efficiency of co-precipitation of XBP1u by HA-VP30 was highly variable (Figure 5(b)). To determine whether the VP30-XBP1u interaction was dependent on the presence of RNA, RNase A/T1 was added to the co-precipitation reaction. Although in the presence of RNase A/T1 VP30-GFP was still co-precipitated with HA-VP30, the interaction of VP30 with XBP1u was no longer detected under these conditions, indicating that the VP30-XBP1u interaction depends on the presence of RNA.

Western blot analysis showed that IRE1 is phosphorylated in MARV-infected cells at 24 h (Figure 6(a)) but not at 48 h p.i. (Figure 6(b)). XBP1s levels increased slightly at 24 and 48 h p.i. compared to levels monitored in DMSO-treated cells. These results correlated with the levels of GP which were higher at 24 h than at 48 h p.i. (Figure 6 and S7a). Analysis of infection revealed that 100% of the cells were infected at 24 h p.i. (Figure S7b). Interestingly, RT\u2013PCR analyses of XBP1 mRNAs (Figure 6(c)) showed no increase of XBP1u splicing upon MARV infection (Figure 6(d)). In contrast, cells stimulated with Tg, clearly displayed induction of XBP1u splicing, indicated by the presence of XBP1s mRNA (Figure 6(d)). Taken together, these data support a model that peak protein production of most likely GP at the ER during the first replication cycle of MARV infection, induces IRE1 signalling, as monitored by IRE1 phosphorylation at 24 h p.i. In contrast, XBP1 splicing was not detected and XBP1s protein levels were only moderately increased.\n",

Relevant to this, siRNA studies have shown that down-regulation of VP30 leads to reduced expression of other filoviral proteins in infected cells, highlighting an important regulatory function of VP30 [46]. To our knowledge, VP30 does not interact directly with GP such an interaction might have explained its inhibitory effect. It was therefore assumed that VP30 directly influences IRE1 or downstream molecules in this signalling pathway. Consistent with this, we observed the RNA-dependent interaction of XBP1u and VP30 (Figure 5(a,b)) but not with XBP1s or IRE1 (Figure S6). Future analyses are needed to investigate the mechanistic details of the binding. Cytoplasmic splicing of the XBP1u mRNA by IRE1 at the ER membrane results in the translation of XBP1s, which is then transported into the nucleus, where it activates UPRE-controlled genes. Several studies have described a translational pausing mechanism that ensures efficient splicing of XBP1u by IRE1. During translational pausing, the nascent XBP1u protein/mRNA/ribosome complex is recruited to the ER membrane, where IRE1-mediated splicing of the XBP1u mRNA is initiated [10,47].",

            "text": "Although many viruses activate UPR, the way in which each virus addresses this cellular response is different. Some viruses seem to benefit from UPR, whereas the growth of others is impaired [13,48]. Other viruses do not activate UPR because they have developed strategies to suppress UPR. For example, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) suppresses IRE1-dependent UPR at early stages of infection through the action of the viral protein UL41, which degrades XBP1 mRNA via its RNase activity [49]. Su et al. showed that the kinase activity of IRE1 was beneficial to HSV-1 infection, whereas the RNase activity of IRE1 was detrimental [50]. Furthermore, the kinase activity of IRE1 results in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which enhances the replication of HSV-1. Human and murine cytomegaloviruses (HCMV and MCMV) activate and manipulate the UPR to promote its pro-survival activity. UPR is inhibited by the M50 protein (MCMV) and the UL50 protein (HCMV), which target IRE1 for degradation [51]. Interestingly, deletion of XBP1u/s impedes MCMV gene expression, thereby causing a kinetic delay in infection [14]. These examples indicate that herpesviruses specifically regulate UPR at certain points in their replication cycles and suggest that tight regulation of the UPR is essential for efficient viral infection. We hypothesize that MARV also time-dependently regulates the IRE1 signalling for its own purpose. During the first 24 h p.i., which corresponds to the first MARV replication cycle, it may be that viral replication is more efficient when IRE1 is present and active (Figure 6(a), Figure 7). At this time point after infection, IRE1 is phosphorylated (Figure 6(a)), but XBP1s expression is only slightly increased. We believe that VP30 weakens the activation of the cascade by a so far unknown mechanism to achieve optimal conditions for viral propagation during its first replication cycle. Later in the course of infection the IRE1 KO seems to support viral infection. Further analyses are required to characterize the contribution of IRE1 and its different functions [52] to MARV replication in more detail.",

The ectopic expression of MARV GP results in UPRE activation. These at a first glance contradictory result are remedied by the discovery that MARV VP30 has an inhibitory effect on UPRE activity, thus counteracting GP-dependent activation. In conclusion, MARV seems to make use of and balances the IRE1-dependent signalling to create optimal conditions for its multiplication.",
