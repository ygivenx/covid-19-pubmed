Maternal respiratory illness required reported or measured fever (>38\u00b0C) with at least one other symptom: cough, myalgia, sore throat or rhinorrhea. Infant respiratory illness was defined as having any of the following: fever, cough, wheeze, difficult or rapid breathing, or a draining ear. Participants who reported protocol-defined respiratory illness had mid-nasal swabs (NS) obtained by field workers during weekly visits. An RSV illness episode was defined as the presence of any symptoms occurring for a minimum of one day with a mid-nasal swab obtained and RSV detected on PCR assay, with a minimum of 7 symptom-free days separating illness episodes. Incidence of RSV was calculated using days of follow-up from enrollment until end of study or loss to follow-up.",

            "text": "Maternal vaccination is recommended in many countries to protect women and their infants against influenza, tetanus, and pertussis [2]. Influenza infection during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk of maternal mortality, as well as low birthweight and small-for-gestational age infants [6]. The mechanism for this is unknown, but may be related to physiologic changes related to pregnancy, decreased cardiopulmonary reserve leading to increased severity of illness, and modulation of the systemic immunologic response to infection [17]. Because of the increased risk of maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes associated with influenza during pregnancy, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommends influenza vaccine be administered at any time during pregnancy [18]. In contrast, pertussis in adults has a relatively milder course compared to the high morbidity and mortality due to pertussis infection in infants. Therefore, pertussis vaccines in pregnancy are administered in the third trimester to maximize transplacental antibody transfer to the infant [19]. RSV transplacental antibody transfer is efficient in mother-infant pairs in South Asia, the United States, and the Gambia [20]. Higher cord blood RSV antibody titers in Bangladesh are associated with decreased risk of serologic infection in infants [21]. Because febrile RSV illness was rare and relatively mild in pregnancy, a potential vaccination strategy would be similar to the pertussis strategy, with prioritization of infant protection from severe disease. Vaccination during the third trimester when antibodies are most likely to be transferred to the infant would maximize protection of the infant in the early postpartum period.",

A phase II trial of a maternal RSV vaccine candidate was recently found to be safe and immunogenic in non-pregnant women of childbearing age [3]. As trials expand to resource-limited settings, it will be important to know baseline incidence rates of RSV infection and adverse birth outcomes in the study population. Previous estimates of RSV incidence in adults in low and middle-income countries have been calculated using outpatient and hospital-based surveillance with estimates ranging from 0.13 to 4.4/1000 person-years in Kenya, Egypt, and Thailand [23\u201325]. In the United States, the incidence of RSV in healthy elderly adults was 8.7/1000 person-years; however, in this study, surveillance was only performed between November and April during periods of RSV circulation [8]. The incidence rates of 11.8/1000 person-years during RSV season in this study are comparable to prior studies. The seasonality of RSV in southern Nepal is similar to that observed in previous studies performed in northern India and other regions of Nepal, with a clear peak during the months of September through November [26, 27]. This is in contrast to influenza, which has a less defined season in tropical as compared to temperate regions of the world [28\u201330].",

In family studies, RSV is associated with fever in only 5\u201327% of illness episodes [32]. These studies suggest the incidence of RSV-associated afebrile respiratory illness could be several-fold higher than found in our study, and potentially account for significant numbers of days with symptoms and health care seeking. Febrile respiratory illness due to RSV in our population did result in a median of four days of symptoms and half of the mothers seeking care for their illness. This is in a region of the world where access to health care is limited by poverty, distance, and gender inequality. Studies in healthy military recruits have found that RSV accounts for 11% of clinically significant respiratory illness in this population, and accounted for one day of missed work in 94% of the cases [33]. An additional limitation was our inability to describe the effect of RSV infection on birthweight or other birth outcomes due to the small numbers of pregnant or postpartum women with febrile RSV illness. It is possible that milder cases of RSV disease without fever can have adverse effects on maternal and infant outcomes, and we were unable to assess this in our study. We did find, however, no mortality or hospitalization due to RSV in this population.",
