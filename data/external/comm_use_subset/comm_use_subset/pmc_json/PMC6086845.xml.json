Fourth, patients with clinical recovery were identified by reviewing the medical records of the study sample within 60 days after the initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis.

This research may enable identification of patients who require receiving appropriate medical support and care according to their illness progression. This also may prevent spread and transmission of the infection as individuals who are still severely ill can be appropriately isolated and managed apart from others who are responding to medical care.",

A prospective study is needed to evaluate the impact of camel exposure on recovery. Evidence was found of an increasing recovery delay with a longer diagnosis delay.
