            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Coronavirus, and causes encephalomyelitis or vomiting and wasting disease in suckling piglets (Andries & Pensaert, 1981; Mengeling, Boothe & Ritchie, 1972). Previous studies have demonstrated that the virus has a strong tropism for the upper respiratory tract and is propagated through the neural route (Andries & Pensaert, 1980). The disease caused by PHEV was first reported in Canada in 1958 (Roe & Alexander, 1958), and the pathogen was first isolated from the brains of suckling piglets with encephalomyelitis in 1962 (Greig et al., 1962). Since then, the infection has been reported in the United States, Japan, Argentina, Belgium, South Korea, China and other pig-raising countries (Gao et al., 2011; Hirano & Ono, 1998; Pensaert & Callebaut, 1974; Quiroga et al., 2008; Rho et al., 2011; Sasseville et al., 2001). Today, many serological surveys have revealed that PHEV is widespread, and there are frequent subclinical infections (Li et al., 2013).",

Here we report that there is a suspected outbreak of PHEV infection on a farm in Changchun of Jilin Province, in 2014, resulting in serious economic losses. Many infected piglets characterized with vomiting and nerve symptoms, and some cases were accompanied by screaming or diarrhea; all of the piglets with clinical symptoms died finally. In this paper, the diagnosis was made on the basis of pathologic features, immunohistochemistry, microbiological detection, and RT-PCR. A PHEV field strain was isolated from the brain tissue of infected piglets, and the major structural proteins of the strain were sequenced to identify genetic relationships with other coronaviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus.",

At the time of the outbreak, these pigs had not been immunized with any PHEV vaccines; the total proportion of deaths in piglets that had not been weaned was 46.7% (140 dead piglets). The collected samples were tested for PHEV using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the HE gene, as well as for other viruses that cause similar clinical symptoms among swine, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and pseudorabies virus (PRV). All experiments on piglets research were performed in accordance with Animal Welfare Ethical Committee of Jilin University guidelines and regulations (permission number 2012-CVM-12). The involved RT-PCR primers were designed based on the most conserved segment of their genomes (Table 1), and subsequently validated by BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) with sequences from GenBank. The original samples were diluted 10-fold with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were centrifuged at 3,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-\u00b5m syringe filter, and was used as inoculums for BALB/c mice or for virus isolation in Neuro-2a cell culture.",

The clinical signs consisted of vomiting, twitching, wasting, and diarrhea were observed in suckling piglets. The histologic autopsy showed that there were pinpoint petechiae in the kidneys, thinning of the intestinal wall, and hemorrhage in the brain. Due to the great similarity between PHEV and pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in piglets, it was difficult to distinguish them only by clinical and autopsy symptoms. Therefore, PRV and PHEV were first detected by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively, and the test results showed that PRV was negative, and PHEV was positive, thus excluding PRV infection. At the same time, no sow abortions or stillbirth phenomena were found in the pigs, also supporting the above results. Immunohistochemical staining results further confirmed PHEV infection in the brains of the dead piglets. Vomiting and neurological symptoms are common in piglets infected with PHEV, but the symptom of diarrhea is relatively rare. Because the outbreak was characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, some other viral infections with similar clinical symptoms have been reported in pigs, including PEDV, TGEV and DPCoV (Ma et al., 2015; Song, Moon & Kang, 2015; Tanaka et al., 2015). In this study, these viruses were further detected to exclude misdiagnosis or mixed infection. Thus, the case was identified as simple PHEV infection, and we successfully isolated a PHEV field strain as PHEV-CC14.",

To characterize the virus isolates, the complete structural genes were sequenced and analyzed, and the phylogenetic relationships among the coronavirus strains were determined. Phylogenetic trees showed that the wild type and HEV-JT06 shared the highest homology, and that identified with HEV 67N was 99%. These findings suggested that PHEV strains currently circulating in China are closely related. Notably, the PHEV strain JT06 isolated from Jilin province, China, in 2006 was most closely related to the emerging PHEV-CC14 strains, suggesting that they could be derived from a similar ancestral strain. Furthermore, we performed sequence alignment and homology analysis between PHEV-CC14 and other coronaviruses, which including MHV, BCoV, HCoV-OC43 and Bat CoV, and we found it shared up to 91% homology with HCoV-OC43 (GenBank: KF530085) (Gonzalez et al., 2003; Li, 2015; Snijder, Horzinek & Spaan, 1993). This finding suggested that, although PHEV infection in humans has not been reported currently, there is a definite potential threat to human health.",

            "text": "According to the deduced amino acids of the PHEV-CC14 strains, genetic evolution and variation analyses were performed. It was found that the broad variation occurred in the encoded structural proteins and functional region. There were five major structural proteins of PHEV, HE, S, E, M and N proteins, encoded from 5\u2032UTR to 3\u2032UTR (Vijgen et al., 2006; Weiss & Navas-Martin, 2005). Sequence analyses of the five structural proteins of the PHEV-CC14 field isolate suggested that PHEV has remained more genetically stable in the E, M and N proteins (Schultze et al., 1990; Vieler et al., 1995). The HE proteins of some coronaviruses are involved in the release of virions from the host cell, and it has been shown to have acetylesterase activity and to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme, which might be related to the early adsorption of coronavirus (Schultze et al., 1991). Compared with HEV 67N, there were two amino acids (S12G, T114I) in the HE protein of PHEV-CC14 that were meaningful mutations, while six amino acid variations were observed (S12G, S15G, K49N, T114I, V116A, L161F) when blasted with the IAF-404 strain. We hypothesize that the amino acid variation of the HE protein might have a certain effect on replication and virulence, but it was difficult to explain the differences in virulence among the pigs, based on the amino acid changes. In addition, there were some variations of the amino acids in the S protein, which plays vital roles in viral entry, cell-to-cell spread, and the determination of tissue tropism (Dong et al., 2015; Lu, Wang & Gao, 2015). Therefore, the differences in virulence of PHEV strains might be caused by multiple factors, and the variation of the whole genome has resulted in changes in their antigenic differences.",
