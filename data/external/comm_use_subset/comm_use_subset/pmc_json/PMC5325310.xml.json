Despite a standard diagnostic workup including chest radiograph (CXR) and microbiological screening, no focus is identified in up to 44% of patients.[2] This can partly be explained by the low sensitivity of radiographs for diagnosing pulmonary infections in neutropenic patients.[3] Acquiring CXRs in respiratory asymptomatic patients with febrile neutropenia is therefore controversial. The ESMO guidelines recommend performance of a CXR in every neutropenic patient with fever, whereas the IDSA guidelines suggest its use only in patients with respiratory signs or symptoms.[1, 4]",

LDCT is performed with low mean radiation doses below 1.5 mSv and without the use of contrast. Two studies comparing LDCT to CXR in patients with persistent febrile neutropenia demonstrated an increased detection of pulmonary abnormalities.[10, 11] Therefore, we hypothesized that LDCT already acquired on day 1 of febrile neutropenia would improve detection of pulmonary infections. The primary aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of LDCT and 2-view CXR for early detection of pulmonary infiltrates. The secondary aim was to explore its performance for early IFD detection.",

Several studies report on the limited diagnostic yield of a respiratory microbiological evaluation in neutropenic patients. In up to 70% of the lower airway infections a pathogen can not be identified.[17, 18] Sputum cultures (which are often not available) only reveal a possible pathogen in less than 50% of cases.[18] BAL seems to be the diagnostic procedure with the highest yield. Despite the low detection rates of a probable pathogen in approximately 50% of cases, it is the most sensitive procedure for detecting IFD.[19] However, since routinely performance of BAL in the initial assessment of fever is not performed due to its invasive nature, a consensus diagnosis as was used in our study is the best available option and complies with established guidelines.[1, 4]",

Therefore the performance of LDCT in all patients with febrile neutropenia might still be cost-effective. This issue should be evaluated in future research.",

The introduction of LDCT improved the detection of pulmonary infiltrates and there was a clear signal that LDCT scanning is capable of detecting invasive fungal infections at a very early stage. Therefore, the use of LDCT in the initial assessment of febrile neutropenia is promising, and should be further evaluated in a larger study powered on IFD detection. Furthermore it would be interesting to see whether LDCT could replace HRCT as imaging tool in patients with suspected IFD in order to decrease radiation exposure.",
