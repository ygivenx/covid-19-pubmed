            "text": "In addition to the seasonal influenza virus, some avian influenza viruses, such as H7N9 and H5N1 avian influenza A, can also infect humans. Since the first human infection with a novel H7N9 influenza virus (H7N9) was confirmed in China in the spring of 2013 [1], there have been five epidemic waves of human H7N9 infections through 2017 [2]. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza infection. However, there is currently no commercial human vaccine available that is specific for H7N9. Antiviral treatment is another critical strategy for controlling infection with H7N9, and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are the most widely used drugs against influenza infection [3]. However, with the increase in drug-resistance-conferring mutations, other measures are also needed to treat infection with H7N9. Previous studies have shown that type I interferon (IFN) was active against the influenza 2009 pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic H5N1 strains [4, 5]. Additionally, the natural IFN Alferon N, was shown to inhibit the replication of oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant H7N9 isolates [6].",

The morphology and functionality of these cells resembles the in vivo human pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium, and this system is a promising tool for the study of respiratory viruses. Many common and emerging respiratory viruses, such as influenza A [7, 8], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [9], adenovirus (ADV) [10], parainfluenza virus (PIV) [11], and human coronavirus (HCoV) [8, 12], can replicate in these three-dimensional (3D) HAE cells. Moreover, some newly described viruses, including HBoV [13, 14] and HCoV HKU1 [15], that could not be cultured on traditional cell lines can be cultured on these cells. Of the currently available cell culture models, 3D HAE cells reconstruct the morphological and physiological characteristics of the respiratory tract to the greatest extent, therefore, it is a robust cellular model for respiratory virus research and can also be used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of drugs and transgenic strategies [16].",

In the A549 and 2D HAE cells, the expression levels of these four genes were significantly higher in the rhIFN-\u03bb1 group than in the rhIFN-\u03b12b group. However, it is noteworthy that the corresponding result was exactly the opposite in the 3D HAE cells. This indicates that the induction of ISGs by rhIFN-\u03b12b and rhIFN-\u03bb1 is inconsistent between 2D-cultured cells and 3D HAE cells.",

In this study, we found that MX1 expression increased markedly following treatment with rhIFN-\u03bb1 or rhIFN-\u03b12b in 2D HAE and A549 cells compared with the results for 3D HAE cells. In addition, knockdown of MX1 expression resulted in a remarkable decrease in the expression of ISGs in A549 cells after infected with influenza A virus, thereby increased virus replication [28]. Although the upregulation of IFN-induced IFITM3 observed in this study was relatively low, the key role of this ISG cannot be ignored. Remarkably, IFITM3 can inhibit H7N9 replication early in viral infection [35]. Additionally, it was reported that monomethylation of IFITM3 at Lys-88 is downregulated after treatment rhIFN-\u03b1, thereby enhancing IFITM3 activity and inhibiting influenza virus [36]. Furthermore, the overexpression of IFITM proteins can rigidify the cell membrane, thus markedly inhibiting viral membrane fusion and entry [37]. IFITM3 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the influenza disease, and it may serve as a potential target for treatment and management of influenza-associated infection.",
