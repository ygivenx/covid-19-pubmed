The ectodomain contains 23 leucine-rich repeats flanked with cysteine-rich caps and a bipartite motif, both of which are critical for ligand binding [13], [14]. TLR3 localizes to either the plasma membrane or acidic endosomes, the latter was presumed to be the site of high affinity binding to dsRNA [15], [16]. Ligand binding induces the TLR3 dimer to orient the two TIR domains to recruit adaptor proteins and activate signal transduction [6], [14].",

However, we have anecdotally observed that highly purified RNAs, including necrotic RNAs, are poor activators of TLR3 in cultured cells when compared to the synthetic dsRNA analog, poly(I:C). These observations suggest that intrinsic features within dsRNAs can influence signaling by TLR3. Also, component(s) in addition to the dsRNAs are needed to activate TLR3. The antimicrobial peptide LL37 and other peptides that can bind dsRNA were recently found to enhance the TLR3 response to poly(I:C) and viral dsRNAs [18]. Since viral RNAs exist as complexes with proteins, we wanted to determine whether viral proteins could act to modulate TLR3 signaling.",

            "text": "HCV, a member of the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family, infects approximately 2% of the world's population, with up to 80% of untreated individuals progressing to chronic infection and severe liver damage [19], [20]. The HCV-encoded polymerase, NS5B, is a validated drug target and has been extensively characterized [21]. As with polymerases in general, NS5B resembles a closed right hand that contains thumb, palm and finger subdomains [19]. In vitro, recombinant NS5B proteins can bind and initiate RNA synthesis by a de novo initiated mechanism or by extension from a template annealed to a primer [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. De novo initiated RNA synthesis uses a single-stranded (ss) RNA template and a purine nucleotide as the first nucleotide, while primer extension uses a partially duplexed RNA [28]. The de novo initiated versus primer-extended modes of RNA synthesis is regulated by a flexible loop named \u03941 that extends from the fingers subdomain to contact hydrophobic residues in the thumb subdomain [27]. The release of the \u03941 loop is needed to sterically accommodate the ternary complex during elongative synthesis. The polymerase from the 2a genotype of HCV exists in a structurally more closed conformation than that of the 1b polymerase in part due to a tighter contact between the \u03941 loop and the thumb subdomain [27], [29], [30]. This feature has been proposed to allow the 2a polymerase to be more efficient at RNA synthesis by the de novo initiated mechanism since it cannot initially accommodate a partially duplexed RNA.",

To document this observation, BEAS-2B cells that endogenously express TLR3, TLR4, and RIG-I were examined for their response to several dsRNAs. BEAS-2B cells have been used extensively to study the effects of viral infection and activation of innate immunity on cytokine production, including the production of Interleukin 6 (IL6) [40], [41], [42]. The dsRNAs tested include the Reovirus genomic RNA, the S4 dsRNA made by annealing in vitro transcribed positive- and negative-sense strands of the Reovirus S4 RNA, and the Bell pepper endornavirus dsRNA, BPEV, purified from bell pepper plants [43], and other viral and synthetic dsRNAs. Transcripts of the JFH-1 genome were used as a ssRNA control. All the RNAs were added to the media of BEAS-2B cells and the amount of cytokine IL6 secreted into the medium quantified by ELISA (Fig. 1A). At 20 h, IL6 levels induced by poly(I:C) (0.13 \u00b5g/ml) was at least six-fold higher than that of dsRNAs or ssRNA (0.3 \u00b5g/ml; Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). The production of IL6 in response to poly(I:C) was rapid and could be observed within 2 h of poly(I:C) addition (Fig. S1B). In contrast, cells treated with S4 dsRNA did not yield level of IL6 significantly above the background even after 20 h (Fig. S1B).",

HEK 293T cells expressing WT TLR3 responded to poly(I:C) (1\u20132 \u00b5g/ml), better than viral dsRNAs (1\u20132 \u00b5g/ml) purified from Reovirus and BPEV (Fig. 1B).

RIG-I is a suitable control in this experiment since it also recognizes dsRNA [46]. Only cells treated with siRNAs to TLR3 had reduced IL6 levels in the presence of BPEV dsRNA (Fig. 1C). With poly(I:C)-induced cells, siRNAs to TLR3 also reduced IL6 production by 51\u00b13% (n = 4) (data not shown; [18]). RT-PCR confirmed that the siRNAs did knock down TLR3 mRNA levels in both untreated and poly(I:C) treated cells (Fig. 1D). ODN2006, which we previously shown to inhibit TLR3 signaling [47] reduced the IL6 levels in the presence of poly(I:C) to less than 20% of the control reaction (data not shown) while EGCG, an inhibitor of RIG-I [48] had no effect on IL-6 production in the presence of poly(I:C) (data not shown). Thus, while the viral dsRNAs are poor TLR3 agonists, the low level of cytokine production by BEAS-2B cells was primarily due to the activation of TLR3. These results form the basis of the hypothesis to be tested in this work: the activation of TLR3 by viral dsRNA requires additional factors.",

Several highly purified RNA-binding proteins were selected to test this idea. These include the recombinant Nsp15 protein from the SARS coronavirus that binds ssRNAs [49], two versions of the Hepatitis B virus capsid protein (H-cp149 and H-cp183) [38], the capsid protein from the Ross River virus (R-cp) [39], the capsid from the plant-infecting Brome mosaic virus (B-cp) [50] and polymerases from the 1b and 2a genotypes of the Hepatitis C virus (1b\u039421 and 2a\u039421) [27].

Incubation of poly(I:C) with the corresponding buffers in which the proteins were purified also did not result in a significant change of cytokine production (data not shown). The presence of poly(I:C) (0.13 \u00b5g/ml) alone induced IL6 and IL8 levels at least five-fold above background (Fig. 2). Several of the proteins added to a final concentration of 0.15 \u00b5M along with poly(I:C) resulted in additional increases in IL6 and IL8 levels of two- to five-fold (Fig. 2A and 2B; Table S1).

Only the cells transfected with the siRNAs to TLR3 had reduced IL6 production compared to cells transfected with nsRNA (Fig. 3A; p<0.05). We reproducibly observed using RT-PCR that TLR3 mRNA treated with the siRNAs were reduced to between 8 and 26% of the level in cells treated with the nsRNA control (Table S2). The presence of the polymerase did not change LPS-induced TLR4 response or change the response from cells treated with only polyinosinic acid, suggesting specific induction of TLR3 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, ODN2006, an inhibitor of TLR3 signaling [47] reduced IL6 levels to 40\u00b17% of control while EGCG, an inhibitor of RIG-I [48] had no effect, further suggesting that the enhancement of dsRNA induced signaling is dependent on TLR3 (data not shown). The HCV polymerase also enhanced the response to poly(I:C) lengths that ranged from 45 to 125 bp (Fig. S2A). These results indicate that TLR3 is required for 1b\u039421 and poly(I:C) to enhance cytokine production.",

However, to establish this directly, we tested a catalytic mutant named GDA wherein the divalent metal-binding motif required for polymerization was mutated. We also tested three additional mutants that are defective for de novo initiation, including a five-residue deletion of the \u03941 loop name m26\u201330 [26]. The locations of the key mutations in the 1b polymerase structure are shown in Fig. 3C. Since m26\u201330 has a major change in conformational to 1b\u039421, we tested it for the ability to bind a dsRNA of ca. 900 bp derived from Reovirus genome and found that retained the ability to bind dsRNA (Fig. 3D).

In this assay, de novo initiated RNA synthesis was determined with template LE19P, whose 3\u2032 terminal puromycin prevents primer extension, while primer extension used template PE46, which contains a partially double-stranded hairpin structure that can be extended by the polymerase. The products of the two modes of RNA synthesis demonstrate whether a single or a partially duplexed RNAs are bound in the template channel of the polymerase [24]\u2013[26]. Furthermore, products from the two templates are associated with two distinct polymerase conformations: a structurally closed conformation can initiate better by a de novo mechanism or a more open conformation that favors primer extension [26]. Notably, the crystal structure of 2a\u039421 has a more closed conformation than that of 1b\u039421 due to additional interactions between the \u03941 loop and the thumb subdomain of the polymerase [29].",

The 26-nt SL26 was used to minimize non-specific interaction by the polymerase so as to better analyze RNA binding potential of polymerase mutant. The RNA-protein complex was visualized with a phosphorimager and the position of the protein identified by staining with Coomassie blue (Fig. 4E). The purified HCV polymerase usually exists as a mixture of monomers and higher order oligomers [27]. Both the monomeric and dimeric forms of 2a.m26\u201330 bound SL26 better than those from 2a\u039421 (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these results show that the changes in 2a polymerase to increase its binding to a largely dsRNA is correlates with increased enhancement of TLR3 signaling.",

It is therefore likely that the altered interaction with RNA is responsible for the inability of H-cp149 to enhance TLR3 signaling when compared to the other capsid proteins. Again, to reduce the effects of nonspecific RNA binding inherent to many RNA-binding proteins, SL26 containing an 11-bp dsRNA was used to examine whether H-cp183 and H-cp149 are distinguishable in their ability to bind RNA. SL26 bound H-cp183 as well as B-cp, and the R-cp (indicated by shifts to higher molecular mass smears). However, no shift occurred with H-cp149 (Fig. 6C).

Based on our current results, Reovirus S4 dsRNA made by in vitro transcription is as potent a TLR3 agonist as the genomic dsRNA extracted from Reovirus virions, suggesting that no obvious posttranscriptional modifications are required to activate TLR3 signaling. Another feature of poly(I:C) that may obviate the need for viral proteins or LL37 may be that the inosine-cytosine base pair has only two H-bonds. We observed that poly(A:U) is also an excellent agonist for TLR3 in the absence of LL37 and viral protein (Fig. S1A). However, weaker base pairing alone is unlikely to provide the full explanation for poly(I:C) being such a potent agonist; poly(G:U), which also has two H-bonds per base pair, is a poor agonist for TLR3 signaling in the absence of viral dsRNA proteins (Fig. S1A).",

In addition, both enzymes and structural proteins can be potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling as long as they interact with either dsRNA or partially duplexed RNAs. The SARS-CoV Nsp15 preferentially binds ssRNA and not dsRNA [49], and could not efficiently enhance TLR3 signaling. A deletion that increased interaction between the 2a HCV polymerase and a partially duplexed RNA template made the polymerase a better enhancer for TLR3 signaling (Fig. 4C). The second feature of the TLR3 enhancers is that they have the ability to form oligomers. This is intuitive with the viral capsid proteins, but viral RdRps have surfaces that mediate oligomerization that may facilitate RNA binding [56], [57], [58]. Indeed, oligomerization of the HCV polymerase can affect the mode of RNA synthesis [27]. LL37 also exists in higher order complexes in the absence of RNA and is required at micromolar concentrations in contrast to the viral proteins that are active in our assays at nanomolar concentrations. This is likely due to multiple LL37 molecules being needed to bind and/or coat the dsRNAs and mediate TLR3 activation [18].",

However, the encapsidated viral RNAs are highly compacted and contain a high percentage of dsRNAs with non-Watson-Crick base pairing, close to 70% [59], [60]. This likely explains how the CP can bind the dsRNA needed to activate TLR3. The CP's of BMV and RRV are capable of binding to the double-stranded S4 RNA in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. S4C). In the context of a viral infection, however, we note it is likely that fully assembled virions may not result in activation of TLR3 signaling if the dsRNAs are not exposed. We have added highly purified BMV virions and Reovirus virions to BEAS-2B cells and 293T cells expressing TLR3 and have not observed induction of cytokines or TLR3-specific reporters (Kao and Ranjith-Kumar unpublished results).",

Whether the dsRNA-binding proteins facilitate binding of the dsRNA by the TLR3 or the uptake of dsRNA to endosomes remain to be determined. However, it is known that TLR3 binds to linear dsRNA [61]. TLR3, unlike the RIG-I-Iike receptors [62], lacks helicase activity to unravel the tertiary interactions that could stabilize the dsRNA. The dsRNA-binding proteins could disrupt the tertiary structure in the dsRNAs to facilitate recognition of the dsRNA by TLR3. Electron microscopy revealed that LL37 decreases the particle size of the primarily globular poly(I:C) and results in more filamentous structures [18]. With the second scenario, the dsRNA-binding proteins could facilitate entry of the viral dsRNAs into endosomes, perhaps by increasing the interaction with trafficking chaperones, such as scavenger receptors [51], but these RNA-binding proteins likely need to complex and bring dsRNA to endosome in order for TLR3 activation to occur. The net effect is an increase in the concentration of ligand available to TLR3. Further studies will be required to unravel the complex requirements whereby the dsRNA-binding protein activate TLR3 signaling.",

            "text": "The results in this work are also informative for the function of the HCV polymerase. We note that the enhancement of TLR3 signaling by HCV polymerase is independent of RNA synthesis since the active site mutant is capable of enhancing TLR3 signaling (Fig. 3D). All polymerases undergo structural transitions between open and closed conformations in response to the stages of nucleic acid synthesis. Indeed, the monomer of the HCV polymerase contains a template channel that can sterically accommodate ssRNA, but not dsRNA [26], [66]. During the formation of a nascent RNA from the template, however, the polymerase needs to release the interaction between the \u03941 loop and the thumb subdomain in order to accommodate the elongating nascent RNA-template RNA duplex. The 1b\u039421 can both extend from a primed template as well as initiate from the 3\u2032 terminus of a single-stranded RNA. We believe that this is a manifestation of the 1b polymerase existing in an equilibrium between the open and closed forms in vitro, likely accounting for better dsRNA-binding by the 1b polymerase and its enhanced ability for dsRNA-induced signaling by TLR3. In contrast, the 2a polymerase exists predominantly in a closed conformation and thus is less able to bind to dsRNA and enhance signaling by TLR3 [29]. Increasingly, the open and closed conformations of the HCV polymerases are being linked to polymerase function. For the 1b HCV polymerase, the open conformation also exposes a binding pocket for the cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma and mediates the ubiquitinylation and degradation of retinoblastoma to increase cell cycle progression during HCV infection [67], [68].",

Previous study by Naka et al [69] found that immortalized liver cells stably transfected with HCV NS5B and HEK 293 cells stably transfected with both NS5B and TLR3 genes show increased activation of TLR3-depedent IFN\u03b2 signaling, although the activation in HEK 293 cells was only 2-fold. In a recent study from our laboratory, transient overexpression of NS5B and RIG-I resulted in 8 to 14-fold induction of IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase activity in Huh7 and in HEK 293T cells while overexpression of NS5B and TLR3 had no effect, suggesting that expression of NS5B in these two cell lines predominantly activates cytoplasmic innate immunity receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 [70]. In both these studies, the NS5B polymerase was expressed from transfected plasmids and catalytic activity of the polymerase is required. In the present study, exogenously added HCV polymerase protein activates TLR3 without requiring RNA synthesis since polymerase mutated at the catalytic site still activates TLR3. In addition three viral capsid proteins as well as LL37 that bind RNA but do not have catalytic activity also activate TLR3 signaling. Addition of both dsRNA and the RNA-binding protein are required for this activation. RNA-binding protein alone has no effect since RNAs synthesized by the HCV polymerase in cells may not enter efficiently into acidic endosomes, the site of TLR3 signaling [15]. Thus the effect and mechanism of TLR3 activation by RNA-binding protein are likely different from that observed by Naka et al. [69] or Ranjith-Kumar et al. [70].",
