Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been classified into 3 genera, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 {de Groot, 2010 #9759}. They are the causative agents of a variety of human and animal diseases. In humans, CoVs produce respiratory tract infections, causing from the common cold to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that may result in death [3], [4], [5]. In animals, CoVs also cause life-threatening diseases, such as severe enteric and respiratory tract infections, and are economically important pathogens [6]. Nevertheless, there is limited information about the molecular mechanisms governing CoV virulence and pathogenesis.",

This pathway includes the activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), leading to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) phosphorylation, and the activation of the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (2\u2032-5\u2032OAS) and its effector enzyme, the ribonuclease L (RNase L), responsible for RNA degradation [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Due to the deleterious effects of this response on virus survival, many viruses have developed different strategies that counteract the host antiviral response triggered by the dsRNA. These mechanisms are mediated by viral proteins or RNAs [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], or by the modification of cellular components [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].",

A general mechanism for all CoVs is the induction of structures in infected cells that may hide viral RNAs from the cellular sensors [28], [29]. Some CoVs downregulate host gene expression. In fact, it has been proposed that genus \u03b2 CoV non structural protein (nsp)1 protein promotes host mRNA degradation in order to suppress host innate immune response [30], [31]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp1 has also been involved in the inhibition of the 40S ribosomal subunit translational activity [30]. Moreover, several CoVs may also prevent the translational shutoff due to the antiviral response, using viral components or modulating cellular factors. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nsp2 acts as a PKR antagonist [32], and MHV N protein antagonizes 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS activity [33]. IBV also induces the over-expression of growth arrest DNA-damage 34 (GADD34) protein, which participates in eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation [32].",

The 3\u2032 one third of the genome contains the genes encoding structural proteins and a set of accessory genes, whose sequence and number differ between the different species of CoV [1], [35]. Traditionally, CoV accessory genes have been related to virulence modulation, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 5a that determines the interferon (IFN) resistance of the different MHV strains [36]. SARS-CoV contains the largest number of accessory genes and it has been proposed that these genes could be responsible for its high virulence [37], [38]. The role of some structural genes, such as SARS-CoV genes E and 6, on CoV pathogenesis has been demonstrated [39], [40], [41], [42]. Nevertheless, the role of other SARS-CoV accessory genes in virus replication and pathogenesis is still under study, as SARS-CoV mutants lacking different combinations of these genes revealed that they had limited impact on virus replication and pathogenesis [37], [38].",

            "text": "TGEV is a genus a1 CoV that contains three accessory genes: 3a, 3b and 7 [43], [44], [45]. The deletion of gene cluster 3ab demonstrated that these genes were not essential for in vitro and in vivo viral replication [45]. TGEV gene 7 is located at the 3\u2032end of the genome, being the last ORF. In general, ORFs located in CoV genomes downstream of nucleocapsid (N) gene have been named as gene 7. And, one to three genes, 7a, 7b and 7c, have been described for several CoVs of genus \u03b1, \u03b24 and \u03b33 at the end of their genomes [35], [46], [47]\n[48]. Nevertheless, most of these genes are not related to each other (J.L.G. Cruz, S. Zu\u00f1iga and L. Enjuanes, unpublished observations). In fact, new genes located in avian CoVs genomes after the N gene have been named differently as they showed no sequence homology to any other CoV genes [49]. TGEV protein 7 is similar to protein 7a of CoV genus \u03b11, with a 72% homology to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine (CCoV) and porcine respiratory (PRCV) CoVs 7a proteins (Figure 1A) [50], [51]. The function of protein 7 has not been identified, and it has been proposed that it could play a role in virulence [52], [53]. The 7ab cluster deletion in FIPV (FIPV-\u03947ab) resulted in virus attenuation [54]. Nevertheless, the specific role that gene 7a plays in attenuation is not clear, as FIPV-\u03947ab phenotype was similar to the one observed for a FIPV isolate lacking only gene 7b [55].",

To avoid gene 7 expression, several modifications that led to an inactive ORF7 transcription regulating core sequence (CS) were introduced (Figure 1B, left panel). The two first nts of protein 7 translation start codon were also removed (Figure 1B, left panel). These mutations introduced into the TGEV infectious cDNA, were predicted to knock down gene 7 expression with minimum alteration to the 3\u2032end of the viral genome, which is required for viral replication [58], [59]. All the mutations introduced in the cDNA were present in the recovered rTGEV-\u03947 virus, after 6 passages in tissue culture of a plaque-purified virus, indicating that they were stably maintained in the rTGEV genome. The absence of subgenomic mRNA-7 in rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells was confirmed by Northern-blot (Figure 1B, right panel). Viral titer and genomic RNA (gRNA) levels were analyzed. Intracellular RNA was only analyzed during those times post infection in which viable cells were bound to the plate (up to 24 hpi). Both mutant and parental viruses showed the same virus growth kinetics and gRNA accumulation (Figure 1C). The rTGEV-\u03947 virus titer decreased after 24 hours post infection (hpi) due to the absence of live cells. This result was expected, rTGEV-\u03947 virus titer decreased at a ratio of 1 log unit per day due to thermal instability and to the absence of viable cells, at this time post-infection, that could produce new virus [60]. These data confirmed that protein 7 was not essential for TGEV replication in cell culture.",

Nevertheless, 2-fold larger plaques were produced by rTGEV-\u03947 (4 mm diameter), compared with those caused by the parental virus (2 mm diameter) (data not shown). Accordingly, in rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells the infectious foci were larger than those observed in rTGEV-wt infected ones at 16 hpi (Figure 2A, left panels). This increased CPE progressed until almost no viable cells remained in the rTGEV-\u03947 infection at 24 hpi (Figure 2A, right panels). The cell death induced by the rTGEV-\u03947 virus was analyzed by permeabilization, propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry (Figure 2B). This technique distinguishes dying or subdiploid cells from normal cells that emit a high PI fluorescence signal [61], [62]. As expected, the wild-type virus induced cell death and DNA degradation during the infection (Figure 2B) [63]. Interestingly, rTGEV-\u03947 caused a significant increase in cell death compared with that caused by rTGEV-wt infection (Figure 2B).",

Caspase 3 activation leads to TGEV N protein cleavage [64], and inhibition of caspase 3 processing, among others caspases, prevents TGEV induced apoptosis [63]. To determine the potential influence of gene 7 on caspase dependent apoptosis, the presence of the processed form of caspase 3 was analyzed by Western-blot using specific antibodies. TGEV infection induced the cleavage of caspase 3 (Figure 3B) and, as a consequence, cleaved N protein was also detected (data not shown), as expected [64]. Moreover, the rTGEV-\u03947 triggered caspase 3 processing faster than the wild-type virus. These results indicated that the increased CPE observed in rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells was most likely due to an enhanced apoptosis mediated by caspase activation.",

To determine whether this was also the case for TGEV-\u03947 virus, de novo protein synthesis during the infection was evaluated by metabolic labeling. No translational stall was detected during rTGEV-wt infection (Figure 4A), as described for other CoVs such as IBV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), or MHV at early times post infection [32], [33], [72]. In contrast, rTGEV-\u03947 infection inhibited host translational machinery, an effect detected from 10 hpi. This translational stop affected both cellular and viral protein synthesis (Figure 4A). CoVs produce viral mRNAs that are structurally similar to those produced by their host (5\u2032 CAP-structure and poly A at the 3\u2032end), allowing CoVs to parasitize the host translational machinery. In some CoVs, such as MHV, selective viral protein synthesis occurs concomitantly with host translational inhibition, using a mechanism not fully characterized [73], [74]. To study the mechanism responsible for protein synthesis reduction in TGEV-\u03947 infection, and to analyze whether viral mRNAs were preferentially translated, the amount of radiolabeled N protein, taken as reference for viral protein synthesis, was related to the total amount of protein (viral plus cellular) per well (Figure 4B). The ratio of viral to total protein synthesis showed no significant differences between rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells (Figure 4B). In addition, no differences in viral proteins accumulation were observed at this times post infection (data not shown). These results suggested that protein synthesis at early times post infection was responsible for the virus that was still being produced after translational shutoff. This result suggested that the absence of protein 7 during TGEV infection led to protein synthesis inhibition most likely by inhibiting a cell translation step common to cellular and viral protein synthesis.",

            "text": "In principle, RNA decay could be responsible for the observed translational shutoff. Therefore, total cellular RNA integrity was evaluated using a Bioanalyzer [75], [76], [77]. Wild-type virus infection induced a modest RNA processing, especially at 24 hpi (Figure 5A). In contrast, rTGEV-\u03947 infection induced a faster and stronger cellular RNA degradation (Figure 5A). This data indicated that the cellular translational shutoff could be due, at least in part, to cellular mRNA degradation. Moreover, the increase in 28S rRNA degradation (Figure 5B), could affect both cellular and viral protein synthesis [78]. Nucleases activated by cell apoptosis could be responsible for the observed RNA degradation [79]. To study whether this was the case, we took advantage of the previous description of the inhibition of TGEV induced apoptosis by the addition of caspases inhibitor ZVAD, without affecting virus production [63]. In fact, after infection of ST cells with wt or rTGEV-\u03947 viruses in the presence of ZVAD, no CPE was observed. Total RNA was extracted from non-treated or ZVAD-treated cells, and the same RNA degradation patterns were observed in both cases (Figure 5C), indicating that the increased RNA degradation caused by rTGEV-\u03947 virus was independent of nucleases activated by cell apoptosis. To determine whether the observed cellular RNA cleavage was due to a dsRNA induced antiviral response, ST cells were treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [Poly(I:C)], which is a potent activator of this type of response [77], [80], [81]. Cells transfected with Poly(I:C) showed the same RNA degradation pattern as those infected with the rTGEV-\u03947 and parental viruses (Figure 5D), in contrast to mock treated cells. These results suggested that the cellular RNA cleavage increase, during rTGEV-\u03947 infection, was due to an enhancement of dsRNA induced antiviral activity. In general, the main effector of this process is RNase L [81], [82], [83]. To further analyze the relevance of this nuclease during TGEV infection, a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) system was used. It was previously described that VV does not induce strong RNA degradation, due to the presence of viral genes that inhibit the RNase L system. To efficiently trigger dsRNA activated RNA degradation by RNase L, cells must be infected by VV expressing 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS and RNase L [84]. Taking advantage of the wide host range of VV, porcine ST cells were infected with VV, or VVs expressing 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS and RNase L. As expected, VV induced a very slight RNA degradation, that was increased by the co-expression of 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS and RNase L (Figure 5D). Moreover, the RNA degradation pattern produced by the expression of RNase L system was identical to the one observed after rTGEV-\u03947 infection, strongly suggesting that RNaseL is the main nuclease involved in the increased RNA degradation after rTGEV-\u03947 infection.",

Therefore, 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS1 expression during infection by rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-\u03947 was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). TGEV-wt infection induced the expression of the 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS1, as expected (Figure 6B) [87]. rTGEV-\u03947 infection also activated this pathway. Nevertheless, the slight differences in 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS1 gene expression between rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-\u03947 infections could not explain the enhanced nuclease activity observed during mutant virus infection (Figure 6B), as 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS1 mRNA level was even lower for rTGEV-\u03947 than for rTGEV-wt virus (Figure 6B).",

Therefore, viral RNA integrity was evaluated by Northern blot assay. The total RNA amount loaded from rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells was 1.5 to 2 fold higher than that loaded from rTGEV-wt infected ones, in order to detect possible degradation species.

Wild-type infection increased eIF2\u03b1-P levels (Figure 8A), reaching a maximum at 8 hpi (Figure 8B). As previously described, for other stress conditions, eIF2\u03b1-P levels decreased at late times post-infection [90], [91]. Similarly, rTGEV-\u03947 infection also induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Figure 8A) but to significantly higher levels than those observed during rTGEV-wt infection (Figures 8A and 8B). Interestingly, the highest difference was detected at 10 hpi, concomitantly with the time at which the mutant virus induced the translational shutoff (Figure 8B). The increased eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was maintained, although at different levels, from 8hpi to 10 hpi, what could be sufficient to account for the translational shutoff, according to previously published studies [92], [93]. Altogether, this result indicated that, besides cellular RNA degradation, rTGEV-\u03947-induced translational shutoff is probably due to an increased and sustained eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.",

In order to detect protein 7, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was inserted between the signal peptide and the rest of the protein (Figure 9A). Protein 7 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western-blot analysis (Figure 9B). Three ST-HA-7 cellular clones (C1, C2 and C3), with different protein 7 expression levels were selected (Figure 9B). The effect of protein 7 provided in trans on apoptosis and cellular RNA degradation was analyzed. Infection of ST cells by rTGEV-\u03947 caused a stronger apoptosis than the rTGEV-wt virus, as previously observed (Figure 9C). Protein 7 provided in trans significantly reduced apoptosis both in rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells and in rTGEV-wt infected ones (Figure 9C). Moreover, infection of ST cells by rTGEV-\u03947 caused higher RNA degradation than the rTGEV-wt virus, as previously described (Figure 9D). The amount of protein 7 directly correlated with the inhibition of RNA degradation, suggesting that protein 7 expression in trans prevented nuclease activation (Figure 9D). Furthermore, GADD34 mRNA expression (Figure S2A) and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation levels (Figure S2B) were reduced by protein 7 expression in trans. Altogether, these results demonstrated that the specific phenotype of the rTGEV-\u03947 virus was due to TGEV protein 7 absence, as it was reverted to the rTGEV-wt phenotype, in a dose-dependent manner, by providing protein 7 in trans.",

Activation of PERK requires the prior activation of the ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP), a biomarker for the onset of the ER stress [100], [101].

            "text": "The PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) can interact with more than 50 regulatory partners. The formation of these complexes determines its substrate specificity, sub-cellular location and activity, allowing PP1 to participate in numerous cellular functions [103], [104]. Therefore, although a decrease in PP1 levels was not detected in rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells, compared with rTGEV-wt infected ones, protein 7 could modulate PP1 activity. To study this possibility, the functional motifs of CoV genus a1 protein 7 were analyzed using the ELM server [105], [106]. A highly conserved sequence at the C-terminus of the protein was identified as the canonical PP1c-binding motif (Figure 10A). The consensus PP1c-binding motif includes a short sequence (R/K)VxF, in which x is any amino acid except those with large hydrophobic residues, surrounded by non-polar residues (Figure 10B) [103]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RVxF motif is sufficient to mediate PP1 binding, whereas the surrounding amino acids are responsible for PP1 binding and allosteric modulation of the enzyme activity [107], [108], [109]. This motif is also present in three viral and several cell proteins, such as herpex simplex virus 1 \u03b3134.5, human papilomavirus E6 oncoprotein and African swine fever virus DP71L, and mammalian GADD34 proteins (Figure 10B). In all cases, these proteins bind PP1c and promote eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation [94], [102], [110], [111], [112], [113]. We have observed that both rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-\u03947 virus infections trigger the cell antiviral response, leading to an increased eIF2\u03b1-P level. We hypothesized that during rTGEV-wt infection protein 7 may interact through its PP1c-binding motif with the PP1 complex, promoting eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, leading to normal protein synthesis (Figure 10C). In contrast, in rTGEV-\u03947 infection, the virus could not counteract the high eIF2\u03b1-P levels, causing translational shutoff and cell damage (Figure 10C). TGEV protein 7-PP1 interaction was evaluated using a pull-down assay with ST-HA-7 cells extracts. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA-agarose followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA showed the presence of protein 7 in both the ST-HA-7 input and immunoprecipitated extracts, but not in ST cells extracts, as expected (Figure 10D). Immunoblotting with anti-PP1 confirmed that PP1c was pulled-down together with protein 7 (Figure 10D). HA-tagged SARS-CoV E protein, which is also a small viral membrane protein was used as a control bait for immunoprecipitation. The interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was specific, as E protein did not co-immunoprecipitate PP1protein (Figure 10D). Moreover, an HA-tagged protein 7 mutant, lacking PP1 binding motif, did not co-immunoprecipitate PP1 protein. Altogether, this results demonstrated TGEV protein 7-PP1 interaction. The presence of eIF2\u03b1 on the co-immunoprecipitated samples was also analyzed. This factor was specifically co-immunoprecipitated both by native and mutant TGEV protein 7 (Figure 10D), suggesting that eIF2\u03b1 was present in the complex formed by TGEV protein 7 and PP1. Furthermore, the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was also evaluated in the context of TGEV infection. ST-HA-7 cells were mock infected or infected with rTGEV-\u03947, to avoid competition with the non-tagged protein 7 encoded by the wild-type virus. PP1 co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged protein 7 in rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells (Figure S4), indicating that TGEV protein 7 also interacts with PP1 in the context of TGEV infection. Moreover, in rTGEV-wt infected ST-HA-7 cells, a decrease in the PP1 co-immunoprecipitated by HA-tagged protein 7 was observed in relation to the rTGEV-\u03947 infected cells (Figure S4B), indicating that protein 7, expressed from rTGEV-wt virus, also interacts with PP1, and competed with tagged HA-7 protein for the binding to PP1.",

ST cells were transfected with the HA-tagged protein 7 mutant, and the expression of this protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). As previously observed, rTGEV-\u03947 virus caused an increased RNA degradation (Figure 11A) and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Figure 11B). Interestingly, protein 7 mutant provided in trans did not reduce the RNA degradation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation caused by rTGEV-\u03947 virus (Figure 11), although eIF2\u03b1 was also pulled-down by protein 7 mutant.

Both viruses showed similar growth kinetics in the lung, although gene 7 deletion mutant virus reached higher titers than the parental virus at early times post infection (Figure 12A). Virulent TGEV strains replicate in the villious epithelial cells of the small intestine and in lung cells, causing severe diarrhea in newborn piglets [57], [114], [115]. The respiratory and enteric tropism of the rTGEVs can be modified by the introduction of an S gene from a virulent strain [57], [114], [115]. The rTGEV-\u03947 deletion mutant used throughout this paper was generated with an exclusively respiratory tropism (see Materials and Methods). To study the relevance of protein 7 in a virulent virus, a recombinant virus with respiratory and enteric tropism, lacking the expression of the gene 7 (rTGEV-SC11-\u03947) was engineered [57]. Growth in lung of rTGEV-SC11-wt and rTGEV-SC11-\u03947 viruses was similar to that of the previous mutant and wild-type viruses (data not shown). Interestingly, the rTGEV-SC11-\u03947 showed accelerated growth kinetics in gut, compared to the wild-type virus (Figure 12B). This behavior correlated with more pronounced clinical symptoms (Figure S5A). Both rTGEV-SC11-wt and rTGEV-SC11-\u03947 infected animals had the same final survival ratio (50%) (Figure S5B). Nevertheless, animals infected with rTGEV-SC11-\u03947 died six days before that those infected with rTGEV-SC11-wt (Figure S5B). Accordingly, virus was detected only in sentinel animals in contact with rTGEV-wt infected piglets, but not in those in close proximity to the rTGEV-SC11-\u03947 infected animals (Figure 12B). This result suggested that the presence of protein 7 facilitated animal survival and virus shedding.",

In general, the activation of this pathway leads to blocking of the cell translational machinery, and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis of infected and neighboring cells (Figure 14) [8], [10].

Nevertheless, a similar mechanism was previously described for three DNA virus proteins containing a PP1c-binding motif, encoded by herpex simplex virus-1 (\u03b3134.5 protein), papilomavirus (E6 protein) and African swine fever virus (DP71L protein) (Figure 10B) [102], [110], [111].

The degradation pattern was identical to that observed after specific RNase L activation, suggesting that this nuclease was the responsible for RNA degradation during TGEV infection. Interestingly, 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS1 expression, which is required for RNase L activation, was similarly increased after infection with both rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-\u03947 viruses. These results suggested that protein 7 may be modulating the 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS pathway at a level prior to RNase L activation (Figure 14). Activation of 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS by dsRNA leads to the synthesis of 5\u2032-triphosphorylated, 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylates (2\u2032-5\u2032A) required for RNase L dimerization and activation. The 2\u2032-5\u2032A are highly unstable due to their potential dephosphorylation at the 5\u2032end by general phosphatases, leaving the core oligoadenylate that does not efficiently activate RNase L [117]. We propose that the complex PP1-protein 7 may counteract RNase L activation through the dephosphorylation of 2\u2032-5\u2032A. In fact, native TGEV protein 7 provided in trans reduced RNA degradation, while a protein 7 mutant that did not bound PP1 was unable to decrease RNA degradation. To our knowledge, this is the first report involving PP1 protein on the dsRNA induced RNA degradation pathway. Surprisingly, viral mRNAs were not differentially degraded after infection with rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-\u03947, indicating that these mRNAs may be hidden from nuclease activity. Initially, protection of these mRNAs could be mediated by their sheltering in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), induced by CoV infection, and identified in MHV [28], SARS-CoV [29], and TGEV infected cells (A. Nogales, L. Enjuanes and F. Almaz\u00e1n, unpublished results). DMVs may provide an environment for viral RNA synthesis, and prevent the action of components of host defenses, such as antiviral nucleases. The mechanisms for viral mRNA protection at later stages of the viral cycle will require further studies.",

In agreement with our results, it has previously been described that the activation of PKR and 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS/RNase L pathways generally leads to apoptosis [118], [119]. Furthermore, apoptosis initiated by RNase L requires caspase 3 activity [120]. Interestingly, the growth kinetics of both viruses was similar, indicating that the increased antiviral response and apoptosis, did not compromise virus replication. It has been previously described that inhibition of TGEV-induced apoptosis did not enhance viral production [63]. Similarly, in other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV or MHV, downregulation of PKR or RNase L, respectively, did not affect virus growth [96], [121]. Altogether these results suggest that, at least for these CoVs, the dsRNA-activated response did not affect viral replication. Nevertheless, all these CoVs have developed strategies to counteract the dsRNA antiviral response [33], [122], [123]. These strategies could control the deleterious effect that an exacerbated antiviral response may cause in the host, and therefore in long term virus survival [124]. In fact, rTGEV-\u03947 virus showed an accelerated growth kinetics in vivo compared to rTGEV-wt. This effect was probably due to a premature cell death in the rTGEV-\u03947 infected animal tissue that promoted a faster initial propagation of the virus.",

A previously evaluated rTGEV without gene 7 expression showed full attenuation, with 100% survival of infected piglets [52], what is at variance (but not in contradiction) with the results presented in this work. Fortunately, the two deletion mutant viruses used in the Ortego et al 2003 paper and the one used here are completely different. The mutant virus in the Ortego's paper was derived from a already highly attenuated virus, only causing 20% piglet death after virus administration. It is essential to realize that this virus already included many additional attenuating genome changes: (i) five engineered restriction sites preceding genes 3a, E, M, N and 7; (ii) the duplication of sequences preceding these genes, required to avoid gene overlapping. Furthermore this duplicated sequences, located close to the gene TRS, contained an additional TRS that regulate the expression levels of each gene, what probably influenced the expression levels of these viral genes; and (iii) a deletion spanning 21 nt upstream ORF7 start codon and the first 17 nt of this ORF, that was introduced to prevent the expression of gene 7. In contrast, the TGEV deletion mutant used in this work only included a point mutation in gene 7 CS and a 7 nt deletion to prevent the production of protein 7. Therefore, the changes observed in the pathogenicity of the Ortego's recombinant virus could not be exclusively assigned to gene 7 absence, in contrast to the results presented in this paper.",

Similar effects have been described for other viruses, such as human hepatitis C virus [125], in which tissue damage was associated to the development of an exacerbated host antiviral response and not with viral replication. Moreover, piglets infected with a TGEV virulent enteric strain lacking protein 7 expression (rTGEV-SC11-\u03947), developed a faster and more pronounced clinical disease. High pathogenicity resulted in a more rapid host elimination, affecting virus long-term survival as the host is essential for virus propagation. From an evolutionary point of view, our results suggested that CoVs genus \u03b11 might have acquired gene 7 to counteract host defenses with the aim of preventing overwhelming tissue damage due to an exacerbated innate immune response.
