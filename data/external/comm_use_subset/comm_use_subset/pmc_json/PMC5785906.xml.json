Both the Chinese government and Chinese medicine enterprises are making efforts to promote TCM as it moves into the overseas market. However, particular issues associated with TCM, such as its complex composition, various effects of its actions, insufficient systematic studies during its internationalization, etc., hinder the adoption of specific TCM drugs in the internationally recognised pharmaceutical market. In this study, we use the SWOT method to analyse the current situation of TCM internationalization, and the analysis is divided into four aspects.",

First, TCM and Western medicine are two different medical theoretical systems with different modes and substantial differences in such aspects as theoretical foundations, methods of thinking, as well as diagnostic and treatment approaches. In the latter, the treatments are partial; in the former, symptoms and root causes are treated simultaneously. TCM has a unique theory as well as diagnostic and treatment techniques and methods. Compared with modern Western medicine, which focuses on detailed molecular targets, TCM thought takes an overall approach and pays attention to syndrome differentiation based on an overall analysis of the illness and the patient\u2019s condition. TCM adopts multiple levels (dimensions) and a multi-targeted method to make overall adjustments and restore the human body to achieve the goal of treating both the manifestation of the disease and its cause.\n",

Berberine exhibits beneficial anti-inflammation effects for the inflammatory bowel diseases, it also differentially modulates the activities of ERK, p38 MARK, and JNK to suppress Th17 and Th1 T cell differentiation indicating that it could be a potential therapeutic drug to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) [3]. Even for a disease without an obvious clinical manifestation according to Western medicine principle, TCM treatment can use its theoretical advantages of syndrome differentiation and effective timing to relieve the disease and make up for the deficiencies of modern Western medicine [4, 5]. For example, in management of metabolic syndrome, TCM is an excellent representative in alternative and complementary medicines with a complete theory system and substantial herb remedies. Ginseng, rhizoma coptidis (berberine, the major active compound) and bitter melon were discussed for their potential activities in the treatment of metabolic syndrome [6\u201311]. Recently, a search of active ingredient(s) from some commonly used TCM has revealed a wide variety of compounds that are biologically active with therapeutic potentials. About 62% of the 240 species were found to contain chemical compounds with pharmacological procies were found for the treatment of at least one disease and 53% of them for two or more diseases [12]. Virtual mapping between databases of Chinese herbal ingredients and molecular targets of diseases is likely to offer a new avenue for drug discovery [13].",

First, the process of chemical drug discovery is long and arduous that it begins from the search of a potential candidate to the development of a marketable drug. The course could be as long as more than a decade [18]. Second, the R&D cost for a new drug can be, in average, more than 800 million USD in the United States (US) [19]. Third, the development of new chemical drugs remains very a low rate of success. Among thousands chemical compounds only a few candidates could reach their first markets as new drugs in recent years. Finally, synthetic chemical drugs are often associated with undesirable side effects in patients. It is now clear that the need of therapeutic intervention in many clinical conditions cannot be satisfactorily met by synthetic chemical drugs. Since the research and development of new chemical drugs remain time-consuming, capital-intensive, safety issues, and undesired side effects, much effort has been put in the search for alternative routes for drug discovery in China [20]. TCM has a long history of use, with extensive literature and clinical applications covering thousands of years. Such as berberine, an active ingredient from Coptis chinensis Franch, is widely used for the treatment of infectious diseases in China [21]. As TCM has the advantages of treatment of special diseases safety, and so on, there are many countries and regions begin to study it. At present, more than 150 countries and regions [22] have established natural botanical institutions, and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focusing on research and development of botanicals, paying attention to the construction of traditional botanical studies and development teams, and focusing on the search for effective natural medicines to replace chemical treatments. Furthermore, there are over 1300 medicinal plants used in Europe [23]. As safe and healthy treatments are associated with a return to nature, TCM can make up for the shortcomings of Western medicine in many areas. We can find the solutions to different kinds of diseases that are hard to cure by using the innovations and developments of TCM. TCM displays a distinctive curative effect for different diseases that are hard to cure and for technological difficulties that are recognized worldwide, such as tumours [24], chronic liver disease [25] and chronic kidney disease [26].",

TCM is a medical system developed on the basis of Taoist philosophy. The theory of TCM was first documented in an ancient Chinese book, Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor\u2019s Inner classic). The book proposes that the human body contains Yin and Yang. A disease is a consequence of disbalance of Yin and Yang. Qi (air) and blood serve as mediators in communication between Yin and Yang. The primary aim in the treatment of illness is to restore the balance, and replenish Qi or blood. Herbal medicines, acupuncture, and massage are often used to restore the balance in the clinical practice in TCM [2, 30].",

The treatment of diabetes should be focused on replenishing Yin (fluid) and evacuating fire (heat) from the body [31].
