            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a diarrheal disease of swine caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). It is characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting in swine of all ages and is especially fatal for neonatal and postweaning piglets. The disease was first described in Europe in the early seventies, and the PEDV virus was first isolated in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978. Since the nineties, several outbreaks have been reported in Asian countries, such as South Korea, China and Japan, and they have been characterized by relatively high mortality rates ranging from 50 to 95%, causing severe damage to the swine industry (Lee 2015; Song et al. 2015b). In the late autumn of 2010, a large-scale outbreak of diarrhea characterized by severe watery diarrhea, dehydration with high morbidity and mortality emerged in a swine farm in southern China, and it has affected an estimated millions of piglets and greatly threatened the global swine industry. The accumulated evidence suggests that the causative agent of the disease was PEDV with a possible variation (Li et al. 2012; Song et al. 2015a; Tian et al. 2013).",

            "text": "PEDV is a member of the family Coronaviridae and has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. PEDV mainly infects piglets and can infect several cell lines in vitro, such as Vero cells. The complete genome of PEDV comprises approximately 280,000 nucleotides (nt) with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends containing untranslated regions (UTRs). The remaining genomic sequences contain seven open reading frames (ORFs) and encode four proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N) (Rasmussen et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2014). The spike protein of PEDV is a type one membrane glycoprotein consisting of the N terminal S1 and C terminal S2 subunits and plays an important role in mediating virus attachment and fusion to target cells. The spike protein contains a multidomain architecture and has been reported to bind to carbohydrate (sialic acid) and aminopeptidase N molecules in porcine cells (Li et al. 2016; Meng et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2018). The neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were identified in recent studies, and that suggested that the epitopes were mainly located in the S1 subunit (Chang et al. 2019; Li et al. 2017). The recombinant expressed S1 protein can also induce protective immunity in piglets (Makadiya et al. 2016; Oh et al. 2014). These factors make the spike protein of PEDV a putative candidate for developing an efficient protective vaccine.",

An attenuated vaccine has been designed for use in sows to protect neonatal piglets in some Asian countries; however, the efficiency of the vaccine still needs to be verified (Paudel et al. 2014; Song et al. 2007). Passive immunization by oral administration of egg yolk antibodies (IgY) obtained from immunized chickens and the colostrum obtained from immunized cows has been shown to prevent and treat PEDV infection in newborn piglets (Lee et al. 2015). Early diagnosis and corresponding prevention and treatment measures are key points for managing PEDV infection, which requires effective antibodies for both diagnostic assays and treatment.",

Pigs of all ages and breeds are susceptible to PEDV, and infections of suckling piglets 1\u20135 days old were the most serious, with the highest infection rate and mortality of 100%. The main symptoms of the disease are vomiting, severe diarrhea and dehydration. The PEDV genome is a single-stranded RNA belonging to the coronavirus family. The total length of the PEDV genome is approximately 28 Kb, containing at least 7 open reading frames (Chen et al. 2019; Nefedeva et al. 2019). The spike protein of PEDV is composed of 1383 amino acids, including signal peptide (1\u201318 aa), neutralization epitopes (499\u2013638 aa, 748\u2013755 aa, 764\u2013771 aa and 1368\u20131374 aa), transmembrane region (1334\u20131356 aa), and a short cytoplasmic region in the middle. The spike protein plays a key regulatory role in the binding of the virus to the receptor. It is involved in the binding to cell receptors and in membrane fusion, which can indirectly regulate virus invasion and stimulate the host to produce neutralizing antibodies, making it the main target for the development of novel genetically engineered vaccines and antibodies that are used for diagnostic and disease prevention and treatment (Kim et al. 2018).",

ELISA results demonstrated that the S7 antibody could specifically bind to the spike protein with strong binding activity, even at a 1 \u03bcg/ml (50 pmol) concentration, demonstrating that the S7 antibody could strongly bind to the spike protein, which is in accordance with published data on sdAbs. Due to their excellent properties of smaller size, permeability and stability, sdAbs have been widely used as probes for immuno-imaging and diagnostic assays. In the present study, PEDV-infected Vero cells were stained with the S7 antibody followed by FITC-streptavidin in a direct immunofluorescence assay. The Vero cells infected with PEDV were nicely stained by the S7 antibody, and the control Vero cells without PEDV infection had no signal. These results suggest the potent application of the S7 antibody as a nanoprobe for the detection of PEDV in living cells. Unfortunately, we did not find any neutralization effects of the S7 antibody on PEDV infection in the current study, which suggests that the S7 antibody is not a suitable passive immunization agent or therapeutic antibody. The results were in accordance with the recent findings that antibodies raised by the spike protein of PEDV with different binding epitopes showed distinct neutralizing effects on different strains of PEDV (Li et al. 2017).",
