Induction of type I interferons (IFNs), a well-known subset of cytokines with antiviral activity, is triggered by a selection of cellular pattern recognition receptors, including TLRs (Toll-like receptors), RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5). These receptors are activated in response to a range of pathogen-specific factors, which includes double-stranded RNA produced during virus infection [1,2]. Secreted type I IFNs (i.e. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), subsequently induce an antiviral transcription program in the infected cell as well as in adjacent cells, thereby magnifying the \"danger\" signal and protecting against the infection.",

A number of studies has shown that CoVs, like the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, are poor inducers of type I IFNs in cell culture, and even escape from detection by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors [3-8]. Consistently, virus-encoded IFN antagonistic functions have been described for both MHV and SARS-CoV [9,10]. In vivo, however, MHV infection appeared to induce the production of IFN-\u03b1 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by a TLR7-dependent mechanism [11]. Moreover, MHV infections of primary neuronal cultures and of the central nervous system (CNS) induced IFN-\u03b2 gene expression, indicating that the production of type I IFNs in vivo is not limited to pDCs [12,13]. Furthermore, neuronal cultures infected with MHV exhibited increased expression of several type I IFN-induced transcription factors [14]. More recently, Roth-Cross and co-workers reported that macrophages and macrophage-like microglia cells produce IFN-\u03b2 in the CNS of MHV-infected mice in a MDA5-dependent manner [15].",

Three different mouse strains (BALB/c, 129SvEv and IFNAR-/- 129SvEv mice), differing in their susceptibility to infection with MHV, were used. Previously, we have observed that 129SvEv mice are significantly more resistant to infection via the intranasal route than BALB/c mice [17]. The reason for the significant difference in susceptibility is not known, but may be related to different antiviral immune responses in these two mouse strains. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of 129SvEv mice lacking the type I IFN receptor, which are not able to control the MHV infection [11], allowed us to identify type I IFN-independent transcriptional responses.",

Groups of mice (n = 4) were sacrificed at 2 and 5 days post inoculation after which the brains were harvested and total RNA was isolated. The extent of virus replication was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR targeting MHV-specific RNA sequences as described earlier [21]. Previously, we demonstrated that the viral RNA load correlates well with viral infectivity in tissue homogenates [17]. While no viral RNA could be detected yet at 2 days post inoculation (data not shown), viral RNA was observed in the brain of both mouse strains at day 5 (Figure 1A). As expected, the BALB/c mice displayed a much higher viral RNA load than the 129SvEv mice.",

We also included known interactors of our hits in this analysis, while proteins that did not demonstrate any known interactions were excluded for clarity. The results are shown in Figure 2A and 2B. Functional association network analysis of the proteins encoded by the \"early\" genes revealed two main modules. One module contained several proteins involved in antigen presentation, while the other module contained numerous proteins involved in the type I IFN response. The key player in this latter module appeared to be Irf7, which is the master regulator of type I IFN-dependent responses [23]. Functional association network analysis of the proteins encoded by the \"late\" genes revealed a large network of proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions. Although the microarray analyses did not reveal the induction of IFN-\u03b3 gene expression itself, IFN-\u03b3 appeared at a central position in the network. In addition, the induction of a type I IFN response was also evident from this network as demonstrated by the presence of the transcription factors Irf1 and Irf8, both of which demonstrated elevated mRNA levels upon MHV infection. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that MHV infection induces a robust IFN response both at 2 and 5 days post infection, in which the transcription factors Irf7, Irf1, and Irf8 appear to be the key players. At 5 days post infection, a type II IFN response also becomes apparent.",

The observation that the BALB/c mice, unlike the 129SvEv mice, exhibited abundant expression of IFN-responsive genes upon MHV infection appears counter intuitive as the 129SvEv mice are much more resistant to the infection than the BALB/c mice. Apparently, the resistance of 129SvEv mice to MHV infection is not controlled by a more robust IFN response. The reason for the observed difference in susceptibility between the different mouse strains after intranasal inoculation is not known. MHV-A59 was recently shown to replicate efficiently in the liver of 129SvEv mice after intraperitoneal inoculation [11]. Interestingly, the resistance of 129SvEv mice after intranasal inoculation is not restricted to infection with MHV, as it was also observed for vesicular stomatitis virus [24].",

To confirm this, we examined the data of the individual BALB/c mice at 5 days post infection in more detail. Clearly, the animals with the highest viral loads (mouse 2 and 4; Figure 3A), also displayed significantly higher levels of induction of type I and II IFN expression (Figure 3B). Likewise, the amplitude of the gene expression profiles (Figure 3C and Additional file 2) of the individual mice also correlated with the viral loads in the brain. These observations are in agreement with results obtained by the profiling of SARS-CoV-infected macaques [25]. Also in that study a positive correlation between virus load and the induction of gene expression was observed. A few genes (n = 6), including ISG20, showed an inverse correlation with the viral load. We currently have no explanation for this observation as expression of ISG20 is known to be induced by type I IFNs [26,27]. Interestingly, ISG20 has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against other viruses [28,29].",

Indeed, when these mice were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of MHV-A59, viral RNA levels in their brains became much higher than in animals from the parental strain at 5 days post infection (Figure 4A). Interestingly, at this time point the viral RNA levels in the IFNAR-/- mice were comparable to those in the brains of the BALB/c mice. However, efficient dissemination of the infection, resulting in high viral loads in the liver as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, was only observed in the IFNAR-/- mice and not in the wild-type mice, which displayed viral RNA levels just above background (Figure 4B). Thus, in agreement with previous studies, a type I IFN-dependent response is required to inhibit virus dissemination [11,15].",

Figure 4C shows an expression-based cluster analysis of these 73 genes for the wild-type and IFNAR-/- mice. Comparison of the complete expression profiles of these mice revealed that the transcriptional profile at day 5 in the IFNAR-/- mice has a larger similarity with the profile at day 2 of the parental 129SvEv mice than with that of the knock-out mice at day 2 post infection (Figure 4C). This observation may suggest the presence of an early host response to infection with MHV in the parental mice, even though no significant induction (\u2265 1.5 fold) of gene expression could be detected (Figure 1B). Such a response, may not be evident in transcriptional profiles of whole organs, but might only be apparent at the cellular level. We speculate that early decisive events are happening in initial target cell populations such as DCs and macrophages [31]. These responses could prevent extensive viral replication very early after infection, thereby reducing subsequent type I IFN responses.",

Not much is known yet about type I IFN-independent responses to infection. The observation that the transcriptional upregulation of Irf1 was independent of type I IFN signalling is consistent with the notion that IFN-\u03b3 can also induce expression of this gene [32,33]. Likewise, we also observed increased transcription of Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 independent of type I IFN signalling, again corresponding with the literature [34,35]. Interestingly, the expression of various genes encoding proteins involved in antigen presentation (i.e. H2, B2m, Psmb8, Psmb9, and Ctss) was also increased in the absence of type I IFN signalling. Psmb8 and Psmb9 encode immunoproteasome subunits which facilitate antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells after virus infection, a process that is primarily regulated by IFN-\u03b3 [36]. Furthermore, also the expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) invariant chain, also called CD74 [37], was increased upon infection of the knock-out mice. These data are in agreement with the observation that the induction of genes involved in antigen processing is independent of STAT1 activation by IFN-\u03b1 [38]. We also observed the transcriptional upregulation of the 3 isoforms of metallothionein (Mt1, Mt2, and Mt3), which encode proteins known to scavenge toxic metals [39]. The induction of these genes, which was not apparent in either wild-type mice, could reflect an acute-phase reaction in the brain of MHV-infected IFNAR-/- mice, which likely contributes to pathogenesis as has been shown for other viruses [40-42].",

The analysis revealed IFN-\u03b3 as the central player in the type I IFN-independent antiviral network as this protein appeared to link a number of smaller modules. The induction of IFN-\u03b3 gene expression could be confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). The finding that IFN-\u03b3-mediated transcriptional responses are not dramatically affected in the absence of type I IFN signalling is in agreement with reports referred to above and with a recent publication by Ireland et al.

            "text": "Several studies have shown that MHV [11,15,17] as well as several other viruses [48-50] replicate to much higher levels (up to 105 fold difference) in IFNAR-/- mice than in their wild-type counterparts. In this study we show that a strong correlation exists between the amplitude of type I and II IFN host responses with the viral load. The huge differences in virus replication between wild-type and IFNAR-/- mice therefore do not permit a fair comparison between gene expression profiles of these mice, with the aim of identifying type I IFN-dependent responses. Indeed, as no significant gene expression is observed in the wild-type 129SvEv mice, a comparison with the expression profile of the IFNAR-/- mice only provides information about type I IFN-independent and not IFN-dependent responses. We now observe, in agreement with our previous study, that the brain of BALB/c and IFNAR-/- 129SvEv mice contain very similar MHV loads at day 2 and 5 post infection [17]. Since the type I IFN-responsive pathway is very well conserved among many different species [51], we considered it acceptable to compare the gene expression profiles of these mice with the aim of identifying type-I IFN-dependent responses, although comparing transcriptional profiles of wild-type and IFNAR-/- mice from a different genetic background should obviously be done very cautiously. Ideally, a comparison between wild-type BALB/c and IFNAR-/- BALB/c mice would have been more accurate. While the induced expression of a number of genes was similar for the two mouse strains (i.e. type I IFN signalling-independent gene-expression), that of other genes was only observed in the BALB/c mice (i.e. tentative type I IFN signalling-dependent gene expression). The expression of yet other genes appeared to be partially dependent of type I IFN signalling: increased expression of these genes was observed in the IFNAR-/- mice, but much more so in the BALB/c mice.",
