NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is a complex process which gives rise to multiple phosphorylation states ranging from the most abundant 28-kDa phosphoisoform up to the hyperphosphorylated 32- to 34-kDa states (19, 20). All of these forms have been found to be more stable in viroplasms, while chemical disruption of viroplasms results in NSP5 dephosphorylation (21). The mechanism of NSP5 phosphorylation is not yet wholly understood, but it involves interactions with other viral proteins. When expressed alone in noninfected cells, NSP5 is not phosphorylated, while coexpression with NSP2 or VP2 results in NSP5 hyperphosphorylation and formation of viroplasm-like structures (VLS) (8, 22, 23). NSP5 hyperphosphorylation involves the phosphorylation of serine 67 (Ser67) by casein kinase 1\u03b1 (CK1\u03b1) to initiate the phosphorylation cascade (24, 25), and it is considered to be essential for the assembly of viroplasms (26).",

Crucially, we have successfully established a novel MA-NSP5 cell line to support the replication of NSP5-deficient recombinant viruses to enable their further in-depth characterization. Both steps i and ii were absolutely required for rescuing the NSP5/KO virus, confirming the essential role of NSP5 for RV replication.

To rescue the NSP5/KO strain, a stop codon at residue 18Y was introduced (Fig. 1A and B). Analysis of MA104 virus-infected cell extracts confirmed the presence of NSP2 and VP2 but not of NSP5 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we did not detect viroplasms containing NSP2, VP2, or VP6 in either MA104-infected cells or stable transfectant cell lines expressing the fluorescent fusion protein NSP2-mCherry or NSP5-EGFP (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, this suggests that the NSP5-EGPF fusion protein is not able to trans-complement the lack of NSP5, and indeed the rRV-NSP5/KO strain does not replicate in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, both genomic dsRNA synthesis (Fig. 2D) and infectious progeny virus production were completely abrogated in MA104 cells but not in the trans-complementing MA-NSP5 cell line (Fig. 2E). Together, these data confirm that NSP5 is essential for RV replication.",

We first generated an rRV carrying an S67A mutation (rRV-NSP5/S67A) (Table 1 and Fig. 3A and B). Its replication in wild-type MA104 cells was strongly impaired (Fig. 3B, right panel), resulting in approximately a 100-fold reduction of the infectious progeny virus titer at different time points postinfection (Fig. 3C). Despite the overall reduction of replication fitness, the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant virus was stable after 10 passages in the wild-type MA104 cells, confirmed by the sequencing of the progeny virus. Consistent with our previous results, the NSP5/S67A mutant was not hyperphosphorylated in all cell lines tested, including MA104, U2OS, and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3D), further confirming the role of Ser67 in the initiation of NSP5 phosphorylation cascade (24). While the wild-type rRV (rRV-wt) yielded multiple hyperphosphorylated NSP5 isoforms, the NSP5/S67A mutant mostly produced a single, homogeneous form of NSP5 with an apparent mass of 26 kDa that could be detected in the virus-infected cell extracts at 5 or 10 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 3E). Enzymatic dephosphorylation with \u03bb-protein phosphatase (\u03bb-Ppase) and alkaline calf intestinal Ppase (CIP), previously used to discriminate phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated NSP5 (19), further corroborated the observed lack of NSP5/S67A phosphorylation (Fig. 3F). Because of the differences in the molecular weight markers used, the NSP5 band with the fastest PAGE mobility has been traditionally described as 26 kDa, and the most abundant one as 28 kDa. Since this nomenclature has been used in many publications, we prefer to maintain it, despite the fact that current PAGE migrations do not correspond to the markers presently used.",

At late infection points (10 hpi), ER filled with TLPs appeared to adopt a more tubular morphology, suggesting a successive step in the virus egress. In contrast, the rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected cells contained only a few immature viroplasms that lacked the ER network filled with TLPs (Fig. 7A, right panel). Only a few immature particles containing transient lipid membranes could be identified in cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant (Fig. 7A, right panel).

We have previously shown that coexpression of NSP5/\u0394T was also unable to trigger the phosphorylation cascade of NSP5/S67A, while other NSP5 mutants referred to here as activators of phosphorylation, e.g., NSP5/\u03943, did (24). Interestingly, upon coinfection with two rRVs, NSP5/S67A and NSP5/\u0394T, neither of the mutated NSP5 variants were phosphorylated (Fig. 8A) (8, 19, 24, 26). This result was supported further by infecting the MA104 transfectant cell line stably expressing NSP5-\u0394T (MA-\u0394T) with the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain (Table 1 and Fig. 8B, lanes 3 and 4). The NSP5/\u0394176-180 mutant was also unable to induce phosphorylation of NSP5/S67A following coinfection with the two rRVs, despite both containing Ser67 and the C-terminal tail.

We therefore asked whether an MA104 stable cell line expressing the deletion mutant NSP5/\u03943 (MA-\u03943) and infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain was able to trigger hyperphosphorylation of NSP5/S67A and, as a consequence, sustain replication of the mutant rRV strain. As shown in Fig. 8B (lanes 5 and 6), NSP5/S67A was hyperphosphorylated in the presence of the NSP5/\u03943 mutant, which was confirmed by the \u03bbPpase treatment (Fig. 8D), although it did not completely rescue the phosphorylation pattern of NSP5 normally observed in rRV-wt infection. When loading large amounts of NSP5/S67A, we have occasionally observed a second faint band with reduced mobility, as seen in Fig. 8B, lane 2 (indicated with an asterisk). Interestingly, regular round structures resembling viroplasms, containing NSP5, NSP2, and VP2 with peripheral localization of VP6, were recovered in these cells infected with rRV-NSP5/S67A, and yet viral replication was nevertheless impaired (Fig. 8E and F). Consistently, the electron microscopy images showed structures of aberrant viroplasms similar to those obtained in MA104 wt cells (Fig. 7B, right panel).",

Moreover, downregulation of expression of the most abundant viroplasm-forming proteins, NSP5 and NSP2, severely impacts the formation of viroplasms and production of virus progeny (13, 15, 25, 31).

Only when NSP5 is coexpressed with NSP2 and/or VP2 do these proteins assemble into the viroplasm-like structures (VLS), which are also capable of recruiting additional structural proteins, including VP1, VP2, and VP6 (8, 10). Given these observations, we hypothesized that complete removal of NSP5 would be lethal for RV replication. Using a modified reverse-genetics system for rotaviruses (29), we here provide the first direct evidence of the essential role of NSP5 in viroplasm formation and viral replication. In order to characterize replication-deficient NSP5-negative mutants, we have established a trans-complementing system that provides NSP5 to the virus both transiently in BHK-T7 cells and stably in the NSP5-producing MA104 cell line (MA-NSP5), thus enabling facile isolation of rRVs lacking functional NSP5. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that NSP5-deficient rRV was unable to form viroplasms and replicate in the wt MA104 cells, while the viroplasm formation and viral replication were efficiently rescued in the trans-complementing MA-NSP5 cell line. Interestingly, the rRVs generated using this method also failed to incorporate dsRNA originating from the NSP5-encoding mRNA lacking the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), further suggesting the essential roles of UTRs for genome packaging in RVs (35, 36).",

Previous studies have suggested that activation of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation may require a conformational change that leads to its efficient hyperphosphorylation via a positive-feedback loop mechanism (8, 23, 24). Two regions comprising the N-terminal amino acids 1 to 33 (region 1) and the central region amino acids 81 to 130 (region 3) have been reported to prevent NSP5 phosphorylation in the absence of other viral proteins, while the 18-aa-long C-terminal tail was found to be essential for its phosphorylation (8, 23, 24).",

Interestingly, further analysis of these mutants reveals some key differences between each NSP5 variant. While the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain formed aberrant structures resembling viroplasms that poorly support RV replication, this variant was still capable of producing infectious progeny, in contrast to the two other rRV mutant strains. Interestingly, the phenotype observed with the NSP5/S67A mutant was essentially the same as the one previously reported with the wt virus infecting MA104 cells silenced for expression of CK1\u03b1, which is involved in phosphorylating Ser67 and initiating the hyperphosphorylation cascade (24, 25). It has recently been shown that CK1\u03b1 is also involved in phosphorylating NSP2, controlling the formation of rotavirus viral factories (37). Our data obtained with the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant strongly suggest that the lack of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation determines both the morphogenesis of viroplasms and their capacity to support RV genome replication. We cannot rule out the role of NSP2 phosphorylation in the assembly of viroplasms, since NSP2 is also likely to be phosphorylated by CK1\u03b1 upon infection of the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain. Despite the formation of aberrant structures resembling viroplasms, the amount of RNA produced within those structures in rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected MA104 cells was practically below the detection limit of 5-EU labeling, while the RNA replication was fully rescued in the trans-complementing MA-NSP5 cell line (Fig. 5). It is unlikely that the viral mRNAs produced in MA104 wt cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain were degraded faster, as most of the ssRNA synthesized is a consequence of the secondary round of transcription from the newly made dsRNA-containing particles. Indeed, very small amounts of dsRNA were detected during the infection of MA104 cells. smFISH results confirmed the presence of small amounts of plus ssRNA in some of these aberrant structures. This result is consistent with the finding that the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain did replicate, albeit at much lower levels than rRV-wt. Thus, these structures are likely to sustain virus replication with decreased efficiency, which was further confirmed by the electron microscopy analysis of MA104 cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain.",

We showed that the NSP5/S67A mutant from the rRV was indeed hyperphosphorylated, albeit not completely, when infecting MA-\u03943 cells, restoring the round morphology of the structures resembling viroplasms with a complete absence of the aberrant structures observed in MA104 cells. This finding strongly suggests that impairment of NSP5 phosphorylation is the direct cause of the formation of the aberrant structures in the cytosol of the infected cell. Despite the fact that these structures appeared morphologically similar to the classical round viroplasms in MA-\u03943 cells, the presence of VP6 around these structures was observed only with the hyperphosphorylated NSP5/S67A mutant, not with the other NSP5 phosphorylation-negative mutants. One possibility is that during RV infection, accumulation of VP6 in round-shaped viroplasms requires a full-length hyperphosphorylated NSP5, as well as phosphorylation of multiple serine residues, likely by CK2 (17, 26). Moreover, the round structures found in MA-\u03943 cells infected with rRV-NSP5/KO failed to contain VP6.",

It involves the interaction of NSP5 with either NSP2 or VP2 (Fig. 11a), required to make Ser67 available for CK1\u03b1 phosphorylation (Fig. 11b). This initial step is then sequentially completed by CK2-mediated phosphorylation of other serines to generate the NSP5 \u201cactivator\u201d (Fig. 11c) during a step dependent on the interaction of the Ser67-phosphorylated molecules with the nonphosphorylated partners in the NSP5 oligomeric complexes (Fig. 11d). Alternatively, oligomers could be formed before the activation step (Fig. 11c\u2032). NSP5 interactions mediated by the carboxy-terminal tails T result in substrate activation and a fully hyperphosphorylated NSP5 (Fig. 11e). This process leads to the assembly of viroplasm scaffolds containing NSP2 (Fig. 11f) and recruitment of VP6, as well as the other viroplasmic proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3, to assemble replication-competent viroplasms (Fig. 11g).",

A similar phosphorylation mechanism has recently been described for nonstructural protein NS5A of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), with the hyperphosphorylation cascade primed by the initial phosphorylation of serine 225 by CK1\u03b1 and the subsequent phosphorylation of neighboring residues involving other kinases (41, 42). Moreover, NS5A phosphorylation has been shown to play a key role in controlling the establishment of replication complexes during HCV infection (43). Similarly, a number of other nonstructural viral proteins have been shown to undergo multiple phosphorylation events during virus infection, suggesting that these complex posttranslational modifications play a pivotal role in orchestrating the assembly of replication-competent viral factories (44\u201346).",
