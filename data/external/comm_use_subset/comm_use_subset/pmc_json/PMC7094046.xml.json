For public health stakeholders and their local surveillance teams to prepare mitigating strategies, an assessment of basic reproduction numbers can be quite helpful. Reproduction number estimates of COVID-19 have varied in different localities within ranges from 1.4 to 3.9 \n3\n\n-\n\n5\n, with epidemic doubling time estimated at 6.4 days by Wu et al.\n3\n and 7.4 days by Li et al.\n4\n Clearly, peaks will also depend on eventual awareness of the local populations, prevention measures on surveillance and interventions taking place.",

Therefore, an option would be to implement interventions to more effectively protect susceptible individuals.

Hence, another possibility is to apply interventions that reduce the time for virus clearance in infected people, decreasing transmission risk and, as a consequence, also decreasing the number of infected people. Such interventions for COVID-19 would require treatment as usually done for severe acute respiratory illnesses but problems still remain. First, there is potential transmission during virus incubation period, i.e., transmission before onset of symptoms when people typically will not enter treatment regimen, and the mean incubation period has been estimated at 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.1 - 7.0 days)\n4\n. Also, there is evidence of asymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting SARS-Cov-2, but the proportion of asymptomatic cases or how intense transmission could be from those cases remains an open question\n6\n. The fact is that transmission before symptoms or even in asymptomatic individuals makes control even harder. Second, targeted intervention would involve specific drug treatment regimens, which are not yet available due to the recent emergence of SARS-Cov-2. Furthermore, diagnostic tests, especially rapid ones, with appropriate levels of sensitivity and specificity will be quite helpful for implementing targeted interventions.",

At this moment, most recommendations for general population to avoid SARS-Cov-2 infection rely on altering social and individual routines, by implementing quarantine upon suspicion or detection of infection, by avoiding medium to large crowded events or gatherings, and also by applying regular hygiene practices or to establish norms for social interaction that avoid close contact. Also, discouraging travel reduces mobility and, as a consequence, the risk of importation and spreading of cases. Furthermore, upon detection of imported cases, personal isolation and contact tracing are also important to control new case bursts, but simulation results show that an effective control will require at least 70% of contacts to be traced, if the basic reproduction number equals 2.5 \n7\n. Interestingly, Fraser et al. have shown that contact tracing also helps to determine the proportion of asymptomatic cases\n8\n.",
