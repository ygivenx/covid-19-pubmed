            "text": "Worldwide, the use of vaccines is seen as critical for the prevention and control of many economically damaging outbreaks of poultry diseases. In Caribbean countries, the use of vaccination to prevent poultry diseases is variable and is mainly influenced by the size of the poultry industry in the various countries. Many of the larger poultry-producing CARICOM countries (for example, T & T, Jamaica, Belize, Barbados, and Guyana) with large poultry (broiler and layer) operations have structured and rigid regimes of vaccination in place, while smaller island states (for example, Grenada and St. Lucia), with smaller poultry and egg production operations, often do not vaccinate their poultry. The larger intensive broiler and layer production units in the Caribbean routinely vaccinate their birds against IBV, NDV, and IBDV, whereas some smaller semi-intensive and backyard operations often do not carry out vaccination against these three viral pathogens. Routine vaccination is not carried out in the region against other viral pathogens (AIV, ILTV, APV, FADV Gp1, and EDSV) included in this review, although occasional vaccination against FADV Gp1 has been carried out in the face of disease outbreaks. All reports/publications describing the detection of viruses and outbreaks of disease in both vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry were reviewed. When information pertaining to vaccination history was given in the relevant report/publication, this information was included.",

            "text": "AIV is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family and is known to cause infection in many susceptible bird species [5]. The virus can cause severe infection with high mortality rates, depending on the pathogenicity of the infecting strain [6]. Due to its segmented RNA genome, AIV is prone to reassortment, sometimes resulting in the emergence of zoonotic viruses [7]. AIV has a wild bird reservoir and this feature is often implicated in the spread of infection to poultry dwellings [8,9]. Outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) have occurred in a few countries across the Americas in recent years. Many studies have reported the isolation and molecular characterization of AIV strains across the region, but most outbreak incidents have been isolated to individual countries, seldom crossing borders [10,11]. Different strains of AIV, including highly pathogenic strains, have caused extensive outbreaks of disease, resulting in severe economic losses in some countries in the Americas. Most notable, recent outbreaks in Mexico and the USA have been extremely damaging to local economies. The recent 2015 outbreak in the USA resulted in direct losses of USD $1.6 billion and a ripple effect worldwide, including in the Caribbean, due to trade restrictions resulting from the outbreak [12]. Multiple outbreaks of LPAI H5N2 occurred in the US throughout 2015 in commercial chicken and turkey flocks, and there were nine reports of H5N2 in wild birds in the USA in 2015. The rapid spread and high levels of circulation of the H5N2 strain observed in the US during this period highlights the risk of transmission to the Caribbean territories through the importation of day-old chicks and the migration of wild birds. The outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N3 in Mexico in 2012 resulted in direct losses of USD $504 million. Mexico is still experiencing occasional outbreaks of disease caused by this virus strain, adding to the overall cost burden [13]. Mexico shares a border with Belize, so the risk of spread of AIV from Mexico to Belize is high. No emergency or preventative vaccination has previously been carried out against AIV in any of the reviewed Caribbean states, although some neighboring nations, such as Mexico, has carried out preventative and emergency vaccination for AIV in the past. Although vaccines against AIV can control and prevent disease, their use in the Caribbean to prevent AIV infections is not justifiable, given the lack of AIV outbreaks in the region. In the event of previous outbreaks in the region, rapid depopulation of affected farms, combined with heightened levels of sanitation and biosecurity, have been used as the methods of choice for the control and eradication of AIV.",

            "text": "In the CARICOM mainland member states, an outbreak of low pathogenic AI (H5N2) was reported in Belize in December 2014 in a broiler breeder flock [13]. The AIV from Belize was a North American LPAI H5N2 virus, which showed 98.8% similarity at a nucleotide level to an H5N2 (A/CK/Mexico/2012 H5N2) strain isolated from Mexico in 2012 [14]. At a high cost for control and eradication, Belize regained free status for AI in accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Article 10.4.3) in September 2015. There have been no previous reports of AI in poultry from the other two mainland states, Suriname and Guyana. The first reports of AIV in Caribbean island states was in 2007, when a low pathogenic (LP) H5N2 virus was detected on the island of Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic (DR), in December 2007 and subsequently in Haiti in May 2008 [15]. The LPAI virus from the DR showed 95.5% similarity to a strain that had been circulating in the USA since 1994. Ten years later, in 2017, a different lineage of LP H5N2 serotype was again reported to be present in the DR [16]. These reports demonstrated the likely ability of the virus to spread from the North American continent to Caribbean island states [11]. A study carried out in Barbados isolated two H4N3 AIV strains from wild migratory birds, highlighting the risk of transmission of AIV strains from wild birds to local poultry flocks and the potential for regional spread of AIV through migration pathways [17]. A 2009 serological study carried out in Grenada found that 18.8% of backyard poultry had antibodies to AIV; however, in a subsequent study, no viral antibodies were detected in commercial layers and broilers on the island [18,19]. In T & T, a sero-surveillance study carried out on layer population on both islands of Trinidad and Tobago revealed no antibodies to AIV in the tested population [20].",

            "text": "Although there have been only a limited number of reports of AIV from Caribbean island states, the potential always exists for AIV to emerge and circulate on these islands. The aquatic wild bird reservoir, the migration patterns of wild birds [8,21], the proximity of the island states to the American continents, and both legal and illegal trade contribute to the risk of introduction. The Caribbean region is subject to the migration of thousands of wintering birds yearly from North America, where frequent cases of AIV occur [22]. This emphasizes the need for preparedness and vigilance across the Caribbean region, especially during the wild bird migratory season, and the need for both active and passive surveillance in domestic and wild birds. It should also be noted that many veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Caribbean countries do not currently have the local laboratory capacity to diagnose AIV in their countries, making it necessary for them to send samples from suspected outbreaks to OIE reference laboratories for confirmation. Caribbean laboratories should be supported to build diagnostic capacity, so they are capable of carrying out serological and molecular testing as part of AI surveillance programs, and in response to viral incursions.",

Novel field strains of IBV were identified to be circulating and causing disease in vaccinated populations of birds that were genetically different to the IBV strains used in the live vaccine [25,27]. This observation of vaccine failure, combined with high levels of genetic divergence between field and vaccine strains, led the authors to recommend that Cuba fully review its IBV vaccination programs. Another study in Cuba revealed rising antibody titers independent of additional vaccine doses in layer birds, indicating that field strains of IBV were circulating in the layer birds [28]. A serological study carried out in T & T found that 100% of the sampled unvaccinated layer birds on both islands were antibody-positive for IBV [20]. A study published in 2011 from Grenada reported a 31% detection rate of antibodies to IBV in a variety of avian species, including broilers, free range chicken, ducks, and turkeys [29]. When the results were subdivided, 77.5% of the positive samples were found to be from free range chickens, while 21% were from commercial broilers. No vaccination against IBV is carried out in Grenada. The circulating IBV viruses were not identified and characterized in the studies from Grenada and T & T, so it is currently unknown whether field or vaccine strains of IBV are circulating on these islands.",

Suriname has reported the continued presence of NDV in poultry in consecutive reports to the OIE [13], but details on the disease occurrences are lacking. Belize reported an outbreak of ND in 2008 in commercial poultry, where mortality rates of 10.8% and 3% were recorded in domestic chicken and turkey flocks, respectively [33]. The Belize NDV isolates showed high levels of similarity to a 2007 NDV isolate from Honduras, all of which clustered into a new clade appearing to have evolved separately from other strains circulating in the Americas region [33]. Since the 2008 epidemic in Belize, outbreaks of NDV have continued to be reported, but only in backyard chicken in the southern districts of the country. The Belize Poultry Association, the Belize Agricultural Health Authority, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Health have partnered to execute a Newcastle disease community vaccination program in the affected districts of the country. Preliminary assessments show that there has been a high uptake of vaccination from communities, especially those that have reported ND outbreaks.",

            "text": "In the Caribbean island states, a severe outbreak of ND was reported in the DR in 2008. The outbreak was caused by a virulent strain of NDV with high genotypic divergence from known and ancestral strains; thus, the strain is considered a novel genotype [34]. Both the virus isolates from Belize and the DR were found to be virulent NDV strains based on intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) scores, clinicopathological assessments, fusion protein cleavage site analysis, and genomic characterization. In the remaining Caribbean island states, there have only been sporadic reports of NDV being present and causing disease in poultry. The last reported occurrence of ND in Jamaica was in 1969, and no further reports of disease have emerged since then [35]. At the bottom of the island chain in T & T, an isolated outbreak of ND was reported to have occurred in Port of Spain in 1952, where birds exhibited classic ND clinical signs in a single flock of backyard chickens [36]. Characteristic severe clinical signs are, however, not always observed with NDV infection, as there are frequent reports of the circulation of low virulent strains of the virus that result in little or no clinical disease [37]. A recent serological study in T & T, where many of the larger poultry operations vaccinate their birds against NDV, reported the presence of NDV antibodies in unvaccinated layer birds, which had no previous history of clinical disease [20]. Seroprevalence levels were found to be 79.8% in unvaccinated layer birds from Trinidad and 80.5% in unvaccinated layer birds from Tobago. In 2014, an island wide survey of commercial poultry flocks in Grenada, where no NDV vaccination is carried out, reported that 47.7% of the tested birds had antibodies to NDV, but no history of clinical signs of disease were reported in the sampled birds [18]. As live NDV vaccines are commonly used globally, it is important to be able to differentiate between the circulation of low pathogenic field strains of NDV and circulating vaccine strains.",

Once the virus is present in a farm environment, it becomes extremely difficult to remove, due to its ability to become latent [39]. Because of this, vaccination against ILTV is not routinely carried out in the Caribbean, as the live ILTV vaccine brings with it the risk of introducing the virus into the region. Over the past 40 years, there have been multiple reports of ILTV outbreaks in various South American countries [40] but very few reports of outbreaks in the Caribbean region. There have been no reports of ILTV being present in poultry flocks in Belize, Guyana, or Suriname. Of the Caribbean island states, only T & T has reported the presence of ILTV. Trinidad experienced a confirmed isolated outbreak of infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) in 2004 [35]. The means of introduction of ILTV onto the farm was never clearly determined. This outbreak was successfully controlled through the depopulation of all birds on the infected farm and other emergency response measures, such as disinfection and movement controls. To ensure that the virus was no longer present on the farm, the new birds introduced onto the farm were tested for the presence of antibodies to ILTV over their lifespan. A recent serological study carried out in layer birds on the islands of T & T revealed no antibodies against ILTV in Trinidad. In contrast, on the sister island of Tobago, 30.7% of the sampled layer birds were found to have ILTV antibodies, although no current or previous history of clinical signs were observed in birds on the antibody positive farms [20]. Since no ILTV vaccines have ever been used in T & T, it is possible that the circulating ILTV is a low virulent strain, or possibly a vaccine strain that has been introduced with imported birds. Further studies are needed to identify the genotype and phenotype of the ILTV circulating in the Tobago poultry to determine whether any serious disease risk is posed. Low virulent strains of ILTV have been reported to be circulating in the wider Latin American region and the virus has been reported to be present in nearby Brazil and Venezuela [40].",

In 2012, an extensive 13-year retrospective report on the presence of IBDV in Cuba highlighted a series of outbreaks and changes in biosecurity measures within the country [51]. During the period from 1996\u20132002, 620 outbreaks were reported, with 120 separate outbreaks being reported in the year 2000. In 1996 alone, 245,921 poultry deaths by IBDV were reported in Cuba. These high levels of outbreaks being reported were thought to be due to a change in the vaccination program in Cuba. Poor vaccine dosage administration and issues with cold storage of the vaccines were thought to be the main causes for the apparent vaccine failure [51]. IBDV has also been confirmed to be circulating in the DR. The DR virus was further characterized and was reported to possess genetic characteristics consistent with vvIBDV [52]. A recent serological study carried out in T & T revealed very high seroprevalence levels (94.9% in Trinidad and 97.1% in Tobago) of antibodies to IBDV in unvaccinated layer birds [20]. On the island of Grenada, where no vaccination against IBDV is carried out, 40.35% of layer birds that were sampled had antibodies for IBDV [18]. These results from T & T and Grenada indicate that the virus is circulating, but the lack of clinical signs observed in the seropositive birds indicates either that low virulent strains of IBDV are circulating or that vaccine-derived strains are circulating. Further genetic analysis of the circulating field strains is needed to address this question.",

Vaccines against specific serotypes of FADV Gp1 are available, but are not widely used in the Caribbean. In response to a serious outbreak of disease caused by FADVGp1 in 2005/2006, Guyana enacted legislation in July 2007 requiring that broiler chicks be vaccinated against the virus prior to sale at hatcheries. In Trinidad, broiler farms vaccinate occasionally in response to IBH outbreaks to prevent the significant economic losses that can follow.",

Disease is characterized by an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac and results in higher levels of mortality than for IBH [54]. FADV Gp1 is found widely in both sick and healthy chickens and, like IBDV, it suppresses the immune system making infected birds susceptible to other infections [55]. EDSV is an avian adenovirus from Group 3. It causes a drop in egg production, as well as the production of defective eggs [56,57]. These clinical signs, though not exclusive to EDSV [41,58], can lead to severe economic losses for poultry farmers.",

No known reports of disease caused by avian adenoviruses have been reported from the mainland states of Belize and Suriname. In Guyana, though reporting is limited, the virus is known to have caused severe outbreaks of disease in poultry along the East Bank of Demerara and the Soesdyke Linden highway from 2005\u20132006. By early 2007, the virus was causing outbreaks of disease further south and east in Berbice, which resulted in the implementation of legislation (Regulation 13 of 2007) requiring that broiler chicks be vaccinated prior to sale at hatcheries. Cases of IBH have been reported in Cuba, where in 1983 the disease was diagnosed, associated with the presence of IBDV, in broilers [61]. A mixed infection of both viruses was confirmed, along with histological changes in both the liver and the Bursa of Fabricius in 28-day-old broilers. In a recent serological survey carried out on the islands of T & T, 100% of the layer birds sampled on both islands tested antibody positive for FADV Gp1 viruses. In contrast, 67% and 100% of the sampled birds were antibody positive for EDSV on the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, respectively [20]. These results reveal that avian adenoviruses are circulating in T & T, but they are not necessarily causing overt clinical disease in infected birds. They may, however, be suppressing the immune system of infected birds, making them more susceptible to other potential pathogens.",

Although active surveillance in response to outbreaks of disease is carried out in many of the larger poultry-producing countries of the Caribbean, limited levels of passive surveillance is carried out in most Caribbean states. Many of the smaller Caribbean countries have limited or no laboratory capacity, making it difficult or impossible to carry out laboratory confirmation of diseases-causing agent in-country. In the larger broiler-producing countries of the Caribbean, the privately owned broiler producers often hire their own private vets and then send samples for disease investigations to private labs in the USA. The results from these investigations are not always published, so it is possible that some information related to disease outbreaks in these countries are not represented in this review.",
