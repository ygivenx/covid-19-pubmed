Among all airway illnesses, asthma is emerging as one of the most important and prevalent diseases [3]. A recent survey estimates that asthma affects 4\u20138% of the American population over 65 years of age and numbers are expected to increase in the upcoming years [3]. Most deaths caused by asthma also occur in this age group [2, 3]. Acute respiratory viral infections such as influenza are often the trigger for asthma attacks and therefore considered the primary culprits in the pathogenesis of asthma in the elderly [4, 5].",

Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CPn) is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes chronic, persistent, and often asymptomatic infections [6]. It is also reported to be implicated in exacerbation of asthma, pharyngitis, and bronchitis [7]. Epidemiological data suggest that most people are infected and reinfected throughout life [8]. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a significant cause of morbidity and death worldwide and a significant threat to the elderly despite the availability of effective antibiotics. CAP due to atypical pathogens, CPn, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as single or copathogens, can cause severe diseases in older patients, resulting in hospitalization. Studies from the literature suggest that Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila are responsible for 9\u201312% and 6\u201313% of CAP, respectively [9]. Reports also indicate that the prevalence of antibodies specific to CPn increases significantly in the elderly [10]. Furthermore, aged mice infected with CPn displayed an increased severity of infection compared to young animals [11]. The age-associate alterations in the function of immune system that may play a role in the increased incidence and severity of CPn infections in the elderly are not well understood.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are present below the epithelial cells lining the airway and are amongst the primary responders to airway infections [12]. DCs present at the airways sense and capture pathogens through a variety of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Subsequently DCs become activated by upregulating the expression of costimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules as well as secreting proinflammatory cytokines. During activation, DCs migrate to the draining lymph nodes to prime and activate na\u00efve T cells. The activation molecules and cytokines secreted by DCs have a major influence on T cell responses [13, 14]. We and others have reported that advancing age significantly impacts DC functions and alters their response to infections [15]. DCs from aged donors exhibit enhanced inflammatory responses at the basal level and display increased reactivity to self-antigens [16, 17]. In contrast to self-antigens, the response of DCs from elderly to pathogens is often compromised. For example, DCs from aged subjects are severely impaired in their capacity to produce interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and interferon-\u03bb (IFN-\u03bb) after activation with influenza virus [18, 19]. Recent in vivo studies in mice have demonstrated that CPn can infect DCs and alter their function to induce a proinflammatory state. Furthermore, CPn may also utilize DCs for dissemination outside the lung [20, 21]. Age-associated alterations in the response of DCs to CPn may therefore play a major role in the increase in CPn infections in the elderly.",

After stimulation with CPn for 24 h, supernatants were collected and assayed with Flow Cytomix and/or ELISA to quantify cytokine secretion. Stimulation of DCs with CPn induced the production of increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03bb), chemokines (CXCL-8, CXCL-10), and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) over unstimulated DCs in both age groups (Figure 2). However, the level of the secreted cytokines and chemokines was substantially different between the two populations. Stimulation with CPn resulted in significantly enhanced secretion of CXCL-10 (P = 0.007, Figure 2(a)) and TNF-\u03b1 (P = 0.01, Figure 2(b)) in DCs from aged subjects as compared to DCs from young subjects. Similar to the Th1 favoring chemokine CXCL-10, DC from aged donors also secreted significantly higher levels of IL-12 relative to DCs from young donors (P = 0.01, Figure 2(c)). In contrast, secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 was significantly reduced in CPn-stimulated DCs from aged subjects compared to DCs from young subjects (P = 0.02, Figure 2(d)). Interestingly this high secretion of IL-10 by DCs from aged subjects was also observed when DCs from aged and young subjects were incubated with a lower number of CPn, that is, 0.1 CPn and 1 CPn (data not shown), implying that exposure to CPn, even at lower concentrations, induces an immunosuppressive response rather than an inflammatory response in DCs from young subjects. However, in DCs derived from aged individuals, this response is reversed and is more of an inflammatory response.",

Given the distinct profile of cytokines secreted by DCs from aged and young donors, we expected differences in the polarization of T helper (Th) cell responses towards Th1, Th2, Treg, Th17, or Tfh. Indeed as is evident from Figure 5(a), culture of CPn-stimulated DCs from aged subjects induced significantly higher level (P = 0.03) of IFN-\u03b3 secretion from T cells as compared to their young counterparts. In contrast to IFN-\u03b3, CPn-stimulated DCs from aged donors induced significantly reduced levels (P = 0.026, Figure 5(b)) of IL-10 production by T cells compared to young DC T cell coculture, further confirming that CPn-stimulated DCs from aged subjects display enhanced level of activation compared to DCs from young subjects. Secretion of IL-17 by T cells was comparable between aged and young subjects (Figure 5(c)). We also determined IL-21 secretion since IL-12 secretion by DCs can induce IL-21 in addition to IFN-\u03b3. CPn-stimulated DCs from aged or young donors did not induce significant levels of IL-21 and the data was comparable in the two groups (Figure 5(d)). No IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-17, and IL-21 were detected in T cells cultured without DCs. DCs cultured alone without T cells for six days also did not secrete any of these cytokines (data not shown).",

Several studies document the importance of persistent CPn infections in the pathogenesis of these diseases [7, 26]. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. DCs are shown to be crucial, not only for sensitization to inhaled antigens, but also for establishing inflammation in the lung [27]. In vivo studies have demonstrated that CPn can infect DCs and utilize them for dissemination from the lungs to other organs. Persistent CPn infection also induces a proinflammatory state in DCs [20, 21]. We and others have demonstrated that advancing age results in significant changes in the function of DCs. DCs from aged subjects are impaired in their capacity to control inflammation due to reduced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL-10 [22]. Here we report that age-associated alterations in DC functions enhance their response to CPn. These alterations induce an increased inflammatory response in the elderly as compared to young subjects.",

This is in agreement with previous reports where also phenotype of DCs from aged and young subjects after TLR stimulation was comparable [15, 30] but the secretion of inflammatory cytokines was elevated. The differences in cytokine production by DCs are not always associated with differences in phenotype [31]. In this study, also DCs from aged displayed an enhanced proinflammatory response upon CPn stimulation as is apparent from the increase in TNF-\u03b1, CXCL-10, and IL-12 and reduction in IL-10 secretion (Figures 2(a)\u20132(d)). We chose to assay CXCL-10 due to its important role as a key chemokine for the recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes into tissue and also because of the association of CXCL-10 with inflammatory and allergic diseases [32]. Furthermore, the infection of mice with CPn via the intranasal route also induced CXCL10 in the airways and enhanced inflammation [33]. Increased CXCL-10 secretion along with increased IL-12 by DCs from aged subjects will therefore enhance the Th1 inflammation in the airways of the elderly. In addition, increased TNF-\u03b1 secretion by the DCs from aged subjects also favors Th1 responses. However, TNF secretion in response to CPn also inhibits the growth of the bacteria in DCs and regulates inflammation via induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) [34]. The induction of IDO in DCs is a mechanism to prevent replication or persistence of CPn infection but since the present study was performed using UV inactivated CPn, we did not analyze the expression of IDO. Regulation of inflammation is impaired in DCs from aged subjects since IL-10 production in response to CPn is not elevated to counter the production of increased proinflammatory cytokines. This is in agreement with our previous observations which also demonstrated that stimulation of DCs from aged subjects with Lithium Chloride, which is well established IL-10 inducer in DCs, failed to do so in DCs from aged subjects suggesting that DCs from aged are inherently defective in the production of IL-10 [22].",

CPn-stimulated cDCs from the blood of elderly also displayed a similar defect in the production IFN-\u03bb (Figure 3(e)). IFN-\u03bb is known to play an important role in the defense against respiratory tract infections, such as influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS coronavirus [38]; however, its role in CPn infection has not been investigated. Our results suggest that IFN-\u03bb may be an important protective cytokine in response to CPn. Previous reports from our laboratory have also demonstrated age-related impaired secretion of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb by plasmacytoid dendritic cells [23] and monocyte derived DCs during influenza infection [19]. This suggests that impairment in IFN secretion is an intrinsic age-related alteration and not associated with a specific type of infection.",

            "text": "Previous studies have reported the induction of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 producing CD4 T cells by CPn-stimulated DCs [28]. We also observed the secretion of both of these cytokines though the T cells stimulated with DCs from aged displayed enhanced proliferation and secreted increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 and decreased IL-10 compared to T cells stimulated with DCs from young subjects (Figures 4(a), 5(a), and 5(b)). The cytokines secreted by DCs in response to an infection dictate the proliferation and cytokine secretion of the T cells [39]. The secretion of IL-12 [31] and CXCL-10 [32] by DCs induces IFN-\u03b3 production in T cells and therefore increased production of these mediators by DCs from aged results in increased IFN-\u03b3 production while enhanced IL-12 and TNF by DCs from aged may be responsible for increased proliferation of T cells [13]. In addition, decreased IL-10 production by DCs from aged may further help increase proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 by T cells [13, 40]. A recent murine study has demonstrated that depletion of IL-10 producing T regulatory cells, which control inflammation and exacerbate airway inflammation and sensitization associated with CPn infection [41]. CD8 T cells are also reported to be necessary for clearing CPn infection in mice as depletion of CD8 T cells results in increased bacterial burden and infection kinetics [42]. Moreover, CD8 T cells also produce IFN-\u03b3 in response to chlamydial infection which complements the IFN-\u03b3 produced by CD4 T cells [43, 44]. Higher uncontrolled production of IFN-\u03b3 by both CD4 and CD8 T cells in aged subjects in response to CPn may therefore lead to aggravation of the inflammatory response in the airway of the aged population.",
