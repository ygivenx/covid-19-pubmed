For the purpose of this pilot study, the Ministry of Health (MOH) identified 21 \u2018sentinel\u2019 health facilities (3 hospitals, 18 health centers) as these were the principal facilities still functioning within the district and represented all seven sub-districts. Eleven of the health facilities were located in the sub-district of Berberati, two in each of the sub-districts of Gadzi, Gamboula and Amada Gaza, and one in each the sub-districts of Carnot, D\u00e9d\u00e9 Makouba and Sosso Nakombo. The district health office, which includes the office of the Director of Surveillance, is located in the city of Berb\u00e9rati. Travel time by car or motorcycle from the health facilities to the district health office ranges from 25 min for the closest facility to 9 h for the most distant. Communities in the district are connected by earth roads but lack public systems of water, sewer and electricity. Cellular network service in the district is provided by three telecommunications operators, while villages located on the border with Cameroon are covered by two Cameroonian operators. Only a basic Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) telecommunication service is available.",

In some districts of the country, that conflict continues to the present day, while in other districts, such as Mamb\u00e9r\u00e9-Kad\u00e9i (MK), tensions persist, but only scattered episodes of violence have occurred. During the period of the PAP study (2015\u20132016), differences in the level of security within the district of MK due to religious violence and non-targeted armed conflict were modest: higher in the more distant sub-districts of Gadzi and Amada Gaza (European Interagency Security Forum (EISF) risk level \u2018medium\u2019) and lower in those districts near to the district capital of B\u00e9rb\u00e9rati (EISF risk level \u2018low\u2019) [12].",

Due to movement of displaced populations, there was considerable risk of outbreaks of epidemic and vaccine-preventable diseases [13]. To accelerate data transmission and a public health response, MOH and MSF proposed a pilot project using an app reporting system in the district of MK. The main objectives were: 1) to improve the completeness and timeliness of disease surveillance information reaching the district health office, and 2) to evaluate the use of the app to enhance data transmission between the health facilities and the district health office.",

Although the app functions optimally with a 3G cellular telephone network or greater, it requires only a GSM network to transmit basic disease data using a series of Short Message Service (SMS). For an Alert, the numbers of cases, hospitalized patients and deaths are submitted in an open text box format. In the Weekly Reports, the number of cases and deaths for each notifiable disease are submitted as a single SMS; hence a complete report requires a total of 20 SMS messages. Data transmission of the SMS messages occurs through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) modem connected to the laptop computer server maintained by the Director of Surveillance of the health district. The modem contains a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card that receives and transfers SMSs into a MySQL database, using Frontline SMS software [15]. After having submitting data to the server, users receive an acknowledgment on their smartphones for each disease notification successfully transmitted. In case of failure in delivery to the server, the app displays an error message on their smartphone screen. In this situation users are required to re-submit the messages.",

The electronic format of the Alert and Report functions was developed to mirror the existing paper-based disease surveillance report forms in French and designed with a graphical user interface to facilitate data entry, reduce typing, and ensure zero-reporting (Fig. 2b) [16]. Once data has been entered in all 40 required fields (case and death numbers for 20 conditions), users have simply to touch the Submit Report tab (paper airplane icon), and the notifications are sent in the form of 20 individual SMS, in a predetermined standardized format using a comma separator to the server which visually displays the data on a dashboard (Fig. 3). Only reports with data entered in all fields (including the reporting of zeros) are able to be sent by the app. All Alerts and Weekly Reports were reviewed by the Director of Surveillance as soon after receipt as possible. Weekly reports were considered: i) Complete if case and death numbers for all 20 conditions were received in the server; ii) Incomplete when some, but not all, of the information on the 20 conditions were received by the server; iii) Rejected if the Director of Surveillance identified an error in the reports after reviewing them and checking the details of suspected cases with the respective health center by means of an open text SMS or telephone call; or iv) Validated when the content of completed reports was deemed to be correct by the Director of Surveillance. With respect to Alerts, the Director of Surveillance investigated the reported cases by telephone with the reporting health facility, however validation of Alerts is not a step included in the app.",

The booster-training workshop permitted troubleshooting of technical problems and included an agreement by focal points to begin transmission of Weekly Reports early (48 h before the submission deadline). The Director of Surveillance of the health district received training and supervision on the use of Argus on the laptop server for 3 hours weekly during a period of 3 months (March \u2013 May 2016).

Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare data completeness and timeliness for MK 2016 with MK 2015 and NM 2016. As the surveillance focal points were absent from their health facilities for the booster-training workshop in Berberati during epidemiological week 14, they did not submit their Weekly Reports until returning the following week. Therefore completeness, but not timeliness of reports, was calculated for week 14. For analysis, the 15-week period was divided into five three-week periods and the distribution of transmission times for these periods compared using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Stata/SE Version 12.0 stcox Efron procedure) [20].",

General syndromic surveillance projects in Papua New Guinea [22], Cambodia [2], and Madagascar [23] have produced moderate improvements in the completeness and timeliness of reporting, e.g. an increase in completeness from 40% prior to 70% during the pilot in Papua New Guinea. Targeted surveillance programs for malaria [24], rabies [3], and influenza in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya [7], respectively, produced considerable improvements in report timeliness, eg. a reduction in the median reporting delay for influenza in Kenya from 21 to 7 days. Mobile technology appears also to have enhanced surveillance in emergency settings, such as following the earthquakes in Sichuan, China [10] and Haiti [11]. However, larger, comprehensive mobile phone-based surveillance systems have not been assessed in post-conflict settings with ongoing insecurity. This project assesses the impact, feasibility, and cost of using mobile technology for the surveillance of a broad range of notifiable conditions using a simple SMS-based application in a post-conflict setting. Our study shows that, within weeks, the completeness and timeliness of weekly surveillance reports can be considerably improved, and the improvement maintained, despite the remoteness of the healthcare centers and primitive road conditions. Although sub-districts were highly compliant in submitting weekly reports on their mobile devices, the proportion whose transmissions were successfully completed differed significantly (Table 2). Of the two distant sub-districts with the medium-level security risk (Gadzi and Amada-Gaza), one managed a high level of completeness (Gadzi 73.3%) relative to the other (Amada-Gaza 43%). Conversely, two sub-districts in areas of low security risk near the capital (Sosso-Nakombo, Dede-Makouba) managed only 66.7% and 56.7% levels of completeness, respectively. The consistently high level of submission of weekly reports from all sub-districts suggests that remoteness and level of insecurity did not constrain the use of the technology in the health centers. Rather, we suspect that the differences seen between sub-districts in report completeness and timeliness may relate more to the quality of the communications network, the aptitude of the participating staff and, in several settings, the need for motorcycle taxi transport to a nearby community to access a telecommunications network.",

This is due to the necessary use of smartphones, the provision of these devices to all health facilities, the purchase of \u2018fleet\u2019 services from multiple cellular network providers, the costs of SMS transmission, the adherence to the \u2018zero reporting\u2019 protocol on a relatively large number of diseases (N = 20), and the need for considerable IT consultant services in the developmental stage. The projection of local operating costs beyond the pilot stage, US$17.20 per health facility per week, includes communication fees, but does not estimate the cost of ongoing technical support and staff training.

Variation in the proportion of reports that were timely, complete and validated did not differ significantly according to the distance of the healthcare centre from the district office and the associated degree of insecurity, but rather appeared related more to the quality of the communications network and aptitude of the participating staff. It is clear from the progressive reduction in transmission time over the 15-week period that staff quickly became more adept at sending complete, correct reports, and submitting them adequately in advance of the deadline. Participating staff reported developing a sense of comfort and ownership of the electronic surveillance system [26], and could become the future trainers for the implementation of this surveillance program in other districts, should the Ministry of Health proceed to scale-up this project to the national level.",

This pilot project focused only on electronic transmission of data from health facilities to the district office; there was no extension to the national level, although the app provides such functionality. Surveillance data that were aggregated and analyzed at the health district office were transmitted verbally by mobile phone to the national office. Clearly, smooth electronic integration of the district program with the national surveillance and health information systems will be vital in the future. We have assessed the impact of smartphones on the quality of disease reporting in a district disease surveillance program. No attempt was made to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the technology\u2019s effects on the broader dimensions of the IDSR system. According to the national IDSR protocol, cases and deaths of most of the listed conditions are to be notified immediately as Alerts as well as in a summative manner in the Weekly Reports, however, it is apparent from Table 1 that the Alert function is underused. Clearly more intensive training and supervision is required to ensure an immediate reporting of these conditions so as to enable a timely public health response. Comparison was made of the completeness and timeliness of reporting in the district of MK during the pilot period (MK 2016) with that observed in the district during the same time period the previous year (MK 2015). However, the poorer quality of reporting in 2015 may have reflected not only the limitations of a paper-based system, but also the residual effects of civil unrest on the functioning of health facilities in the district at that time. Only a simple cost analysis is presented; a full cost comparison and cost-benefit analysis merits future study. Usability of the system was measured with a short semi-quantitative questionnaire. The responses of the focal points show little variability and the app were ranked highly on all dimensions. It is possible that the instrument used was not adequately sensitive and/or that participants chose to provide a positively biased evaluation of the app to the investigators.",
