However, severe ARDS induced by avian influenza A (H7N9) pneumonia might manifest as refractory hypoxaemia even with appropriate invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) support. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the ultimate respiratory support method and directly improves the oxygenation and ventilation of patients as well as enables implementation of the \u201clung protective ventilation strategy\u201d [3]. ECMO was the breakthrough treatment for the severe avian influenza A (H1N1) outbreak of 2009 and reduced mortality from this outbreak [4\u20136]. Therefore, we believe that ECMO could also be effective for other types of severe viral pneumonia.",

One of 14 patients showed an aggregated lung infection after weaning and eventually died due to septic shock. The in-hospital mortality was 63%.

Our patients met the indications for ECMO support. The duration of MV for more than 7 days pre-ECMO is an important prognostic factor for death [25]. For patients in the successfully weaned group, the duration of IPPV pre-ECMO was 5 \u00b1 1 d; however, the duration was even longer among patients in the unsuccessfully weaned group (6 \u00b1 4 d). Moreover, rescue ventilation strategies were implemented for most patients before ECMO, which partially delayed the timing of ECMO. In comparison, ECMO was initiated at 2 h (1\u20135 h) after IPPV among patients with pH1N1 in Australia and New Zealand in 2009 [5], which was significantly shorter than that in our cases.

The REVA registry study examined 123 patients with pH1N1-induced ARDS [6] and showed that the high Pplat (29 cmH2O) on day 1 of ECMO was related to high mortality. In our study, the pre-ECMO Pplat level was high (29 \u00b1 8 cmH2O). High Pplat can lead to overdistension of the alveoli and cause lung volutrauma. The shear force between the overdistended and collapsed alveoli further aggregates VILI [27], which ultimately increases mortality. Although the Pplat values decreased to different degrees after ECMO, the Pplat of the unsuccessfully weaned group was significantly higher at 48 and 72 h during ECMO. The principle of low VT was similar in that we found a lower VT during ECMO in the successfully weaned group. A retrospective observational study of 168 patients with severe ARDS [28] showed that a high PEEP level within 3 d of being on ECMO was related to decreased mortality. Although no difference was observed in the PEEP levels between the two groups, we speculated that the down-regulation of PEEP during ECMO might have further aggravated the occurrence of collapse-induced injury, which led to atelectasis and sputum discharge obstacles. Therefore, the IPPV parameters, including high Pplat and VT levels and low PEEP settings, might have been unreasonable in our study; lung rest or the maintenance of open alveoli was not achieved.",

The pH and PaCO2 did not significantly differ between the two groups during ECMO therapy, while patients who eventually weaned successfully from ECMO had a gradual ascending tendency in PaO2 at 48 and 72 h on ECMO and a sustained low level of lactate after ECMO therapy",
