Today, pharmaceutical patents are globalized through the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) [4], and then further reinforced through bilateral and regional arrangements (the so-called TRIPS-Plus agreements [5]). But the patent system stimulates innovation only where industry sees the opportunity for increasing sales and market share; much of the resulting \u201cinnovation\u201d is in fact imitation, producing \u201cme-too\u201d drugs that offer little, if anything, in the way of therapeutic benefit over existing drugs (Box 1).",
