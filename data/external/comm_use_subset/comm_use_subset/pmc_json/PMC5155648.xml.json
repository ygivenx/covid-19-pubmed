The introduction should provide background information justifying the choice of antibody detection assay and thresholds for specific antibody titer or changes in antibody titer, which may be indicative of prior or recent infection [ROSES\u2010I 2.1 and 2.2]. Depending on their design, seroepidemiologic studies can provide data on a variety of measures of the frequency of an outcome in the study population. For example, cross\u2010sectional seroepidemiologic studies provide estimates of the point prevalence of different titers of antibodies, which are used as markers of prior infection (or vaccination) and may indicate the current level of antibody\u2010mediated protection against infection with antigenically similar viruses if protective thresholds or correlates of protection have been established. The wording \u201cseroprevalence at an antibody titer of \u2026.\u201d is preferred to \u201cinfection,\u201d because antibody titers are dynamic, initially rising and then generally declining during variable periods after infection, and therefore, different assumptions underlie inferences about prior infection from antibody concentrations. Serological testing of paired serum specimens provides estimates of the cumulative incidence of virus infection (or incidence proportion). Serial cross\u2010sectional or prospective longitudinal cohort studies can be used to estimate cumulative incidence of virus infection.4 Serology can also be used in studies of populations in specific settings, such as households, healthcare settings, or other confined settings (such as military units, child/elderly care centers or prisons), to estimate the risk of secondary virus infections or to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies in specific populations. The specific measure of occurrence that is being estimated (e.g., point seroprevalence, cumulative incidence, secondary infection risk) should be described in the introduction [ROSES\u2010I 3.1].",

The methods section should begin by describing the study design, the study population, sampling procedures (e.g., random or convenience), the source of serum or plasma that was analyzed (e.g., frozen stored vs recently collected and tested), the rationale for choosing the study design, and the generalizability beyond the study population [ROSES\u2010I 4.1]. Inferences about the probability of prior or recent virus infection based on the titer of antibody in a single serum sample, or changes in the titer of antibody in sequential serum samples, are based upon assumptions about the kinetics of antibody titers following virus infection. In order for readers to assess or test the validity of the assumed relationship, it is important that details are provided of the actual or likely period of exposure(s) to the circulating virus strain and infection risk in relation to the time point that the serum samples are taken [ROSES\u2010I 5.1\u20105.3]. For example, an overly short (<14 days) or overly long (>6 months) interval between exposure(s) and serum sampling will increase the probability of uninterpretable results because antibody titers may not yet have reached a maximum titer, or may have decayed below the seroprevalence or seroconversion titer detection thresholds set to define infection retrospectively.",

Thus, comparison of the results of different case\u2010ascertained virus transmission studies requires this information [ROSES\u2010I 6.1]. For example, subjects with a clinical illness that is severe enough to seek medical care, or those with preexisting comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or with poorly developed immune systems (e.g., young infants), may be more infectious than mild case patients detected through active follow\u2010up of case contacts. Similarly, the virus load in clinical specimens, and therefore infectivity, may differ among subjects with infections detected by virus culture, molecular diagnostic techniques, or rapid antigen detection point\u2010of\u2010care (POC) diagnostic tests. In addition, the duration, intensity, and route of exposure during the index case patient's illness will influence the infectiousness of the index case patient to close contacts. For studies of virus infection transmission risk in households or closed settings, or for outbreak investigations, the definition of the setting being studied (e.g., how a household was defined) should be described in order to permit comparison with other similar studies [ROSES\u2010I 6.2\u20106.3]. The results of seroepidemiologic studies among humans of antibodies to novel avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have sometimes been challenging to interpret, because it is difficult to distinguish the detection of low titers of virus\u2010specific antibodies from the detection of low titers of cross\u2010reactive antibodies. As such, seroepidemiologic surveys of novel AIVs should ideally compare the seroprevalence in exposed populations to the seroprevalence in populations who have likely not been exposed to the animal reservoir or to sick human case patients, and should report the efforts to validate the assay in virologically confirmed cases [ROSES\u2010I 6.4].11, 15, 26\n",

For influenza, antibody may be present as a result of immunization. It is therefore essential that where a vaccine exists, details are provided of the vaccine(s) used in the study population, when vaccination was administered in relation to the timing of sample collection during the investigation [ROSES\u2010I 7.2], the methods used to identify and record vaccination history [ROSES\u2010I 8.1], as well as statistical methods used to control for the potential effect of immunization [ROSES\u2010I 9.1]. When no data are available on vaccination in the study population or the general population from which the study participants were chosen, this should be stated clearly along with any anecdotal information as to the presence or absence of vaccination during the period of study. When pathogens share similar antigenic epitopes, antibody assays may detect cross\u2010reactivity to more than one pathogen. For example, antibodies that cross\u2010reacted with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were detected in serum samples collected prior to the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. These cross\u2010reactive antibodies were typically found in older people who were exposed to earlier influenza A(H1N1) viruses, particularly the 1918 H1N1 virus.27 Therefore, any known or potential immunological cross\u2010reactivity and efforts to detect and control for cross\u2010reactivity should also be reported [ROSES\u2010I 7.3; 12a.7]. Influenza virus infection can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic infection to a rapidly progressive fatal illness. Different definitions of clinical illness and different methods of ascertaining the presence or absence of clinical illness will have variable sensitivity and specificity for detecting an influenza\u2010associated illness. The definitions and methods used to identify the clinical outcomes should be described [ROSES\u2010I 7.4].",

The potential to introduce selection bias into the study should be addressed in the discussion.

            "text": "For seroepidemiologic studies, it is particularly important that full details and conditions of assay methods to detect antibodies are reported including the upper and lower limits (antibody dilution range) of assay detection. In addition, variable conditions of the assays should be described. The minimum detection level of the assay, and how this limit is defined or calculated, should be reported, as should the handling in the analysis of samples with a result below or on the borderline of the minimum detection level [ROSES\u2010I 11.1]. A result below the minimum detection level of the assay is consistent with an antibody titer of anywhere between zero and just below the limit of detection. How these titers are analyzed and interpreted can affect the results, especially if they constitute a large proportion of the results. A common convention, which is acceptable, is to consider a result below the limit of detection as a serial step below that limit; that is, if the starting antibody dilution is 10, then a value of <10 can be reported as a five for the purposes of data analysis rather than a zero or a \u201cnot detected.\u201d Similarly, antibody titer thresholds to define a seropositive result are critically important yet are, in some studies, fairly arbitrary. Thresholds that are designed with high specificity for diagnostic purposes in the cases of clinical illness may not provide reliable estimates of virus infection rates at the population level, if specificity has been optimized at the expense of sensitivity.31 Therefore, the criterion for defining a positive result (as either an indication of prior infection or to infer protection) and the justification for using this criterion in the particular study setting must be reported [ROSES\u2010I 11.2]. Immunological correlates of protection from influenza virus infection and illness are difficult to establish and the relationship between antibody titer and protection is not binary (completely protected above a titer threshold and completely unprotected below the threshold).32, 33 Therefore, if results are used to make inferences about the proportion of a population or population subgroup that are \u201cprotected,\u201d it is important that this is justified by reference to what is known about the correlation between antibody titers measured by the specific assay and protection from infection or illness [ROSES\u2010I 11.3].",

It is noteworthy to point out also that cumulative incidence of virus infection is sometimes referred to as an \u201cattack rate,\u201d although a proportion of infections may be asymptomatic (and therefore not \u201cattacks\u201d), and the quantity measured is a proportion and not a rate.

This antigen should be antigenically equivalent to the specific virus strain to which the study population was exposed. To enable the comparison between laboratories and also aid in the development of the specific serologic assay in other laboratories, all detection parameters (red blood cell species and concentration (as percent v/v), ELISA substrate, starting and end dilutions, etc.), the number of replicates performed and controls, as well as biosafety requirements, should be reported (ROSES\u2010I 12a.6, 12a.8\u201012a.10, 12a.11). The definition and method of endpoint titer calculation should be stated. Interpretation of the data is reliant on appropriate description of the limitations of each serologic assay (ROSES\u2010I 12a.5) and the reproducibility of the assay (ROSES\u2010I 12a.12). Performance of additional serological assays to confirm or calibrate results, if appropriate, should be included. Specifically, as the WHO recommendation for A(H5N1) viruses recommends the use of confirmatory serologic assays upon the detection of single serum positive by MN assay, any confirmatory assays used and the criteria for positivity also need to be described in the same details as above (ROSES\u2010I 12a.13).38, 39 Inclusion of available international standards40, 41 facilitates the comparability of serological data. Inclusion of the actual titers obtained from the international standards and indication whether the data are reported as raw values or international standard\u2010adjusted values should therefore be described (ROSES\u2010I 12a.14).",
