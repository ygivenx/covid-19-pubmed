RLRs, including RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, mainly recognize viral dsRNA or ssRNA, and ultimately lead to MAVS-IRF3-mediated transcription of target genes and the production of type I IFNs [7\u20139]. There are more than ten TLRs, three of which can recognize viral RNAs in endosome [10\u201313]. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA and recruits the adaptor molecule TRIF to promote IRF3/7 import into the nucleus to activate the expression of type I IFNs and ISGs [14, 15]; TLR7/8 detect ssRNA and recruit the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) to activate IRF7 to trigger the expression of type I IFNs [16, 17]. Both of the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and ALRs, including AIM2, IFI16 and IFI204, can activate the STING-IRF3 signaling pathway to induce the type I IFNs [4, 18\u201321].",

Among the p200 family proteins, IFI16, AIM2 and MNDA are from humans, and IFI204, IFI205, IFI209, AIM2, MNDA and MNDAL are from mice. In addition to their functions in DNA sensing pathways [21, 24\u201330], the p200 family proteins can also act as modulators of many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence and DNA repair [23, 31]. In addition, IFI16 has been identified as an ISG that triggers proinflammatory mediators and therefore plays an important role in autoimmune diseases [26, 32]. However, Gray and colleagues have reported that ALRs including 13 PYHIN proteins are dispensable for interferon response to viral DNA in mice [33]. Therefore, the functions of p200 family proteins in antiviral responses need to be further clarified.",

Interestingly, we found that the IFI204 can specifically interact with IRF7 with its HIN domain and therefore hijack IRF7 in nucleus, consequently blocking the binding of IRF7 with its cognate transcriptional promoters. Moreover, other p200 family proteins that harbor a HIN domain could also bind with IRF7 and specifically down regulate the downstream transcription. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of negative regulation of type I IFNs response by p200 family proteins during RNA virus infection, which may prevent the host innate immune system from over-activation. This indicates that ALRs play two opposite roles during the infection of DNA and RNA viruses.",

            "text": "To identify the function of various cell factors induced by RNA virus infection, we adopted a BMDC infection model by murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which is typical RNA virus with positive single stranded RNA. As shown in Fig 1A, bone marrow cells were harvested from 8-week-old mice (C57BL/6) and induced with GM-CSF for 7\u20138 days. BMDCs were infected by MHV and collected at 18 hours (hrs) post infection (hpi). The differential expression level of host factors was measured by analyzing the transcriptome and proteome before and after MHV infection. We found that over 1000 genes at mRNA level and 200 at protein level were changed, among which 100 cellular factors were up-regulated or down-regulated both at mRNA and protein levels (Fig 1A). In this model, the transcription of Ifnb, Ifna1, Ifna4, Ifna6, Tnf and Il6 were significantly activated (S1 Fig), indicating that the IFN response and proinflammatory cytokines were apparently induced. Notably, the p200 family proteins, including IFI204, IFI205, IFI209 and MNDA were expressed at higher level after MHV infection (Fig 1A). Interestingly, IFI204, which is previously reported to initiate type I IFNs in DNA virus-infected cells, obtained high scores as up-regulated factor both at mRNA and protein levels (Fig 1B). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed that the MHV infection induced a 5-fold upregulation of the mRNA of Ifi204 at 18 hpi (Fig 1B). Moreover, the transcriptional regulation of Ifi204 is consistent with viral growth curve in MHV-infected BMDCs (Fig 1C). However, Ifi204 was not stimulated in IFN-associated receptor-deficient (Ifnar-/-) BMDCs (Fig 1D), indicating that the upregulation is interferon-dependent. Furthermore, the similar phenomena were observed in wt BMDCs and Ifnar-/- BMDCs infected by a DNA virus (HSV-1) (S2 Fig). These data indicate that the expression of IFI204 is induced by type I IFNs during the infections of DNA or RNA viruses.",

            "text": "As is known, RNA viruses trigger IRF3- and IRF7-mediated activation of type I IFNs, while DNA viruses activate STING-IRF3 signaling pathway [24]. In our MHV-induced BMDCs model, a set of host factors in both IRF3 and IRF7 signaling pathway were stimulated (S6 Fig). Therefore, to find out which signaling pathway is inhibited by IFI204, IRF3 or IRF7 were co-transfected with IFI204 into Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which were infected by HSV-1 or SeV as the model of DNA or RNA virus, respectively. As shown in Fig 3A, in IRF3-transfected Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212 MEFs, the transcription of both Ifnb and Ifna4 could be activated by either HSV-1 or SeV infection. However, IFI204 can only enhance the transcription of Ifnb induced by the infection of HSV-1 in the presence of IRF3 as previously reported. In contrast, in IRF7-transfected Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212 MEFs, the transcription of both Ifnb and Ifna4 could only be activated by SeV infection or by the self-activating IRF7 mutant IRF7-\u0394247\u2013467 [36] (Fig 3A). Intriguingly, IFI204 significantly inhibited the transcription of both Ifnb and Ifna4 in SeV-infected IRF7-rescuing MEFs or IRF7-\u0394247-467-rescuing MEFs (Fig 3A). In addition, the ELISA analysis showed that the production of IFN\u03b1 was also remarkably inhibited by IFI204 in SeV-infected IRF7-transfected Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig 3B). Consistent with Fig 3A, the infection of HSV-1 could not effectively induce the expression of IFN\u03b1 in IRF7-rescuing MEFs. However, IFI204 could still inhibit the expression of IFN\u03b1 induced by the self-activating IRF7-\u0394247\u2013467 mutant in the context of HSV-1 infection (Fig 3B). To confirm the above observed results, we further evaluated the transcriptional activation of Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters through more sensitive luciferase assay in Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212 MEFs. As shown in Fig 3C, IFI204 inhibited the transcriptional activation of Ifnb and Ifna4 promoters in SeV-infected IRF7-rescuing and IRF7-\u0394247-467-rescuing MEFs but not IRF3-rescuing MEFs. Furthermore, IFI204 could repress the transcriptional activation of Ifna4 promoters induced by overexpression of IRF7 with or without SeV-infection in HEK293T cells (Fig 3D), indicating that the inhibition takes place at the downstream of IRF7 activation. Together, these results indicate that IFI204 can significantly inhibit IRF7-mediated type I IFNs responses, and this inhibition event only occurs in RNA virus-infected cells, which could effectively induce the IRF7-mediated signaling pathway.",

            "text": "To explore the mechanism, we demonstrated that IFI204 could interact with IRF7 by exogenous and endogenous co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis (S7 Fig). Domain mapping analysis suggested that the first HIN domain (HINa) of IFI204 (aa 225\u2013428) was responsible for the association (Fig 4A). Truncation mapping analysis showed that the N-terminus of HINa domain (aa 225\u2013241) of IFI204 and the DBD domain (1-134aa) of IRF7 were the key interaction motifs (Fig 4B and S8 Fig). To test whether it is direct association between IFI204 and IRF7, GST-fused IFI204 and MBP-fused IRF7 were expressed and purified in vitro, and the GST pull-down analysis suggested that the association between IFI204 and IRF7 is direct interaction (Fig 4C). To confirm the interaction in vivo, the IFI204 and IRF7 were observed to co-localize in nucleus of SeV-induced Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212 MEFs by immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy (Fig 4D). To reveal the function of this interaction, IFI204 or its 15 aa-deletion mutant IFI204 (IFI204-\u0394225\u2013239), which disrupts the interaction of IFI204 with IRF7 were co-transfected with IRF7 into Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212MEFs. As shown in S9 Fig, IFI204 mutant (IFI204-\u0394225\u2013239) had significantly less inhibition than wildtype IFI204 to IRF7-mediated expression of IFN\u03b2 under the stimulation by SeV (S9 Fig).

            "text": "Because the IFI204 and IRF7 were co-localized in the nucleus of RNA virus-infected cells, we hypothesized that IFI204 would hijack the imported IRF7, leading to suppression of the downstream transcription. The nucleo-cytoplasmic separation analysis revealed that knockdown of IFI204 could remarkably reduce the phosphorylation level of IRF7 and decrease the amount of nuclear IRF7 in SeV-, poly(I:C)- or ssPolyU-induced NIH3T3 cells (Fig 5A and 5B). Confocal fluorescence microscopy also confirmed this observation, indicating that IFI204 could interact with IRF7 and increase the amount of nuclear IRF7 (Fig 5C). These results suggest that negative regulation of IRF7-mediated IFN responses by IFI204 was not due to the inhibition of the phosphorylation and nuclear import of IRF7, but due to blocking a downstream step, such as DNA-binding. Therefore, we adopted the CHIP and EMSA analysis to investigate the binding efficiency of IRF7 and its cognate promoter DNA. As shown in Fig 6, the CHIP analysis demonstrated that IFI204 remarkably inhibits the binding of IRF7 and its promoter DNA. In contrast, the IFI204 mutant (IFI204-\u0394225\u2013239) had significantly less inhibition on the binding of IRF7 with its specific promoter DNA (Fig 6A). The EMSA analysis showed that the IRF7 could bind to PRDI region on the promoter of IFN-\u03b2 gene as previously reported [36], while IFI204 could not bind with the IRF7-specific promoter (Fig 6B). This result excludes the possibility that IFI204 directly binds to PRDI promoter to inhibit its transcription. As shown in Fig 6C, the binding of IRF7 and PRDI was remarkably attenuated by the IFI204 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6C). Together, the results indicate that the interaction of IFI204 and IRF7 prevents IRF7 from binding to IRF7-specific promoter DNA.",

Therefore, we investigated whether other proteins of the p200 family possess the similar function as that of IFI204. As shown in Fig 7B and 7C, the representative p200 family proteins, including IFI205, IFI209, IFI202 and MNDAL from mice and MNDA, IFI16, IFI16\u03b2 and AIM2 from human, all could interact with IRF7 (Fig 7B) and showed a significant repression of type I IFNs response in SeV-induced IRF7-transfected Irf3\u2212/\u2212Irf7\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig 7C). To confirm this result, IFI205 was overexpressed in BMDCs and the expression level of IFNs were repressed (S10A Fig). In contrast, knockdown of IFI205 stimulated SeV-, or poly(I:C)-induced expressions of IFNs in NIH3T3 cells (S10B Fig). Taken together, p200 family proteins, which contain the conserved HIN domain might play a negative regulation role in IRF7-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway. During RNA virus infection, the activated IRF7 would be bound with HIN domain of p200 family proteins, such as IFI204, IFI205 and IFI16, thus inhibiting the subsequent gene transcription (Fig 8). In contrast, HSV-1 infection could not effectively activate the IRF7-mediated signaling pathway but promote cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway to facilitate IRF3 activation.",

            "text": "IFI204/IFI16, known as ALRs and expressed constitutively in host cells, are involved in the sensing of intracellular DNA derived from pathogens and subsequent induction of the production of type I IFNs as well as proinflammatory mediators via STING-IRF3 pathway [19, 24]. However, Gray and colleagues demonstrated that ALRs, including IFI204, are dispensable for the interferon response to intracellular DNA in mice with knockout of all PYHIN proteins [33]. Two later studies reported that IFI16 cooperates with cGAS-STING pathway to promote the type I IFNs during the DNA virus infection [28, 29]. In this study, we showed that IFI204 could promote the expression of IFN\u03b2 via IRF3-mediated signaling pathway (S5 Fig and Fig 3) but down regulate the IRF7-mediated IFN response. Why inconsistent results were obtained from different studies is still one unanswered question. We propose that PYHIN proteins may not be essential in DNA sensing (as shown by Gray et al.) but involved in the regulation of interferon responses (as shown in this study and by different laboratories). The regulatory function of p200 family members may involve more than one PYHIN protein, and when all PYHIN proteins are knocked out, such regulation could not be observed and, instead, the regulation of interferon response is compensated by other regulation system. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy may be due to the use of different inducers (or viruses) and cell types. More studies are needed to clarify these issues in the future but they are already beyond the range of current work, which focuses to reveal the negative regulatory function of p200 family proteins in IRF7-mediated type I IFN responses (Figs 2, 3 and 7).",

However, only a few ISGs are known to negatively regulate type I IFN responses and proinflammatory mediators. Here, we demonstrated that the IFI204 and several other p200 family proteins were highly induced in both DNA and RNA virus infection (Fig 1 and S2 Fig). Intriguingly, IFI204 specifically inhibits the IRF7-mediated type I IFNs response in RNA virus infection (Figs 2, 3 and 7). The infection of DNA virus HSV-1 could not effectively stimulate the IRF7-mediated signaling pathway as shown in Fig 3 and in previous studies [19, 24]. However, in the absence of IRF3, IFI204 could still inhibit type I IFN responses initiated by the self-activating IRF7-\u0394247\u2013467 mutant in the context of HSV-1 infection (Fig 3B and 3A). Such results suggest a specific function of IFI204 in suppression of IRF7-mediated type I IFNs responses in whatever way IRF7 is activated.",

By CHIP and EMSA assays, we revealed that IFI204 could specifically interact with the DNA binding domain (DBD) of IRF7 and consequently inhibit its subsequent binding with promoter DNA (Fig 6).

However, the whole signaling pathway should be tightly regulated to avoid overproduction of IFNs and inflammatory factors that can cause tissue damage and even autoimmune diseases [38]. For example, the acute coronaviral infection such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and overdosed IFN\u03b1 in antiviral treatment can cause tissue damage due to the hyper-inflammatory responses [39]. Here we use MHV that belongs to the same genus betacoronavirus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to mimic the acute RNA virus infection. In our MHV-infected BMDC model, both IRF3- and IRF7-mediated pathways of type I IFNs and some subsequent proinflammatory mediators were stimulated (Figs 1 and 3, S1 and S6 Figs). Notably, IRF7-mediated pathway of type I IFN responses is mainly initiated by ssRNA sensor TLR7, and previous studies reported that the over-expression or activation of TLR7 is associated with autoimmune diseases [40\u201342]. The over-expression and activation of TLR7 as well as the stimulation of IFN\u03b1 were also observed in our MHV-infection BMDCs model (Figs 2 and 3, S6 Fig), which is consistent with clinical symptoms. Our current study revealed a novel negative regulation mechanism in the RNA virus-induced IRF7-mediated IFN responses.",

Taken together the results of this study and previous knowledge, we propose a model for the function of IFI204 in negative regulation of IFN responses as shown in Fig 8. Many host negative regulators of IFN responses are constitutively expressed in cells [43]. In contrast, p200 family protein IFI204/IFI16 is up-regulated during virus infection (Fig 1). We may assume that induced expression of IFI204/IFI16 might exert more robust regulation of IFN responses.",
