It is now considered as an efficient unbiased tool in clinical virology [1, 2], in particular for the characterization of viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Several advantages of metagenomic NGS (mNGS) compared to conventional real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays have been highlighted. Firstly, the full viral genetic information is immediately available allowing the investigation of respiratory outbreaks, viral epidemiological surveillance, or identification of specific mutations leading to antiviral resistance or higher virulence [3\u20135]. Secondly, a significant improvement in viral ARIs diagnosis has been reported [4, 6\u20139]; as the process is sequence independent, mNGS is able to identify highly divergent viral genomes, rare respiratory pathogens, and to discover respiratory viruses missed by targeted PCR [1, 4, 7].",

Most of the published viral metagenomic protocols have been optimized for the detection either of DNA viruses or RNA viruses [4, 5, 10\u201313]. In addition, despite the growing number of studies using a metagenomic process in clinical virology, evaluation of workflows has not systematically included both clinical samples and quality control (QC) implementation. A metagenomic protocol involves a large number of steps and all of these have to be controlled to ensure the quality of the generated sequences [6, 14\u201316]. Furthermore, specimen to specimen, environmental, and reagent contaminations are also a major concern in metagenomic setting and must be accurately evaluated [6, 17\u201319].",

These samples were initially sent to our laboratory for routine viral diagnosis of ARI using semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays targeting a comprehensive panel of DNA and RNA viruses (r-gene, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019\u00e9toile, France). This panel included: influenza virus type A and B, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6, human bocavirus (HBoV), human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, human coronavirus (HCoV), human metapneumovirus, and measles virus. Twenty-two samples were positive for only one targeted virus, 6 were characterized by a multiple viral infection and 9 were negative for all the targeted viruses. These 9 samples were also found to be negative using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FA RP, bioM\u00e9rieux). After PCR testing, the rest of samples were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C until mNGS analysis.",

As previously described, modified whole transcriptome amplification was performed to amplify both DNA and RNA viral nucleic acids (WTA2, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) [21]. Amplified DNA and cDNA were then purified using a QiaQuick column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified using the Qubit fluorometer HS dsDNA Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Nextera XT DNA Library preparation and Nextera XT Index Kit were used to prepare paired-end libraries, according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). After normalization, a pool of libraries (V/V) was made and quantified using universal KAPA library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA); 1% PhiX genome was added to the quantified library before sequencing with Illumina NextSeq 500 \u2122 platform (Fig. 1). In addition, it should be noticed that our wet-lab process was designed to prevent contaminations as much as possible: reagents were stored and prepared in a DNA-free room; patient samples were opened in a laminar flow hood in a pre-PCR room; after the amplification step, tubes were handled and stored in a post-PCR room.",

Remaining reads were aligned on ezVIR viral database v0.1 [22] and bacteriophage genomes from the RefSeq database (downloaded on 17 February 2017) using bwa mem. Normalization for comparing viral genome coverage values was performed using reads per kilobase of virus reference sequence per million mapped reads (RPKM) ratio [4, 23]. RPKM ratio corrects differences in both sample sequencing depth and viral gene length. Viral reads (expressed in RPKM) from the No-Template Control (NTC) were subtracted from viral reads (in RPKM) of each sample within the batch prior to further analysis. A sample was considered to be positive for a particular virus when the RPKM of this virus was positive. No threshold regarding genome coverage pattern was applied nor requirement to cover a particular region of the genome. This latter requirement could be important to correctly identify RNA virus subtypes with high recombination frequencies within a species, but has to be implemented specifically for each viral family.",

The MS2 bacteriophage was selected as IQC for three main reasons; firstly MS2 is widely used as IQC during viral real-time PCR assays to control both extraction and inhibition [24], secondly, an RNA virus was required to control the random reverse transcription and second strand synthesis steps, and thirdly MS2 is a ssRNA virus with a small genome (3569-bp) that is perfectly characterized and therefore can be easily detected after bioinformatic analysis without the need for extensive NGS reads. The use of MS2 as an IQC has been previously reported for metagenomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid specimens [25]. In another metagenomic study, RNA of MS2 was included after extraction as an IQC but the use of purified RNA does not validate the viral enrichment step [26]. In the protocol described herein, whole MS2 virions were added to each clinical sample from the beginning of the workflow. QCT1 was implemented to control the first steps of the process and to avoid unnecessary library preparation when these steps fail. At the end of the workflow, QCT2 was able to invalidate 2 samples as neither MS2 nor viruses causing ARIs were significantly detected after metagenomic analysis while routine PCR screenings detected a HBoV and a HCoV. The re-testing of these 2 samples found the same findings suggesting an inhibition or a competition issue during the process. Without the use of IQC, these samples would have been mistakenly classified as false negatives by mNGS. However, the expected competition between viruses and MS2 during the process could lead to a non-detection of IQC reads in case of high viral load. Thus, the interpretation of IQC results should consider the proportion of viral reads of each sample. Although not observed, IQC reads may also be reduced in samples with a greater numbers of patient cells which may affect the sensitivity of the assay [25].",

Our workflow allowed the characterization of both DNA and RNA viruses up to a semi-quantitative real-time PCR Ct value of 36 which is considered to be a low viral load. A major critical point in viral metagenomics is to reduce host and bacterial components. In comparison with similar studies, viral reads herein were highly represented (mean = 7.4%); for example, a study on 16 nasopharyngeal aspirates tested positive with viral PCR assays found a mean of 0.05% of viral reads [12]. In addition, a strong correlation between results of mNGS and conventional real-time PCR was obtained by regrouping viruses according to their genome types. Similar findings were reported elsewhere, suggesting that mNGS results could be used for semi-quantitative measurement of the viral load in clinical samples [3\u20135, 12]. A lower RPKM values for dsDNA viruses compared to the other viral genome types were noticed. As previously described for EBV and CMV, the necessary use of DNase to reduce host contamination may affect these fragile large dsDNA viruses [9, 10]. As the detection limit of mNGS analysis is mainly dependent on viral load and total number of reads per sample, this effect could be overcome by increasing sequencing depth; however, we chose to limit the costs of the workflow.",

The use of a universal workflow for both DNA and RNA viruses also reduces the reagent cost compared with metagenomic protocols targeting DNA and RNA viruses separately. In contrast, targeted NGS of specific viruses following their specific amplification by PCR can be up to 2 times cheaper based on our experience (e.g. influenza virus sequencing [28]. Due to several limitations, including its cost and a long turnaround time, viral metagenomics is currently considered to be a second-line approach and is not used as a primary routine diagnostic tool. However, with the improvement of sequencing technologies allowing real-time sequencing such as MinION sequencers (Oxford nanopore, Oxford, United Kingdom), it could be envisioned that mNGS will gradually be used for primary diagnosis in the mid-term. In case of high viral load and sufficient DNA input after amplification our workflow might be used with a MinION sequencer.",
