These early outbreaks were characterized by severe clinical signs and mortality rates of up to 100% in young fattening pigs. In the beginning, no cases were reported from suckling pigs. Later on, pigs of all ages showed similar disease in different European countries, and over the following years, PED was reported from Belgium, the United Kingdom (UK), The Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, France, Switzerland, and Spain7\u20139. For unknown reasons, the occurrence of PED in Europe decreased markedly after the 1980\u2019s evidenced by lacking reports of further outbreaks and a very low seroprevalence in the nineties and the following years10, 11. There were only sporadic outbreaks reported associated with low mortality, e.g. in The Netherlands, Hungary and the UK12\u201314. In contrast, PEDV caused outbreaks of higher economic impact in Asia15, 16. Still, endemic infections are reported from Asia, and the impact on the productivity of industrialized pig farms remains high17, 18. Since 2005, PED cases were again sporadically reported from Europe, i.e. Italy, but without much leverage on the pig industry19.",

In the following, starting in April 2013, PED occurred for the first time in the United States (US) and rapidly spread through nearly the whole country. High mortality rates of up to 95% were reported among suckling pigs, which led to unimaginable economic losses of whole piglet batches. The exact origin and introduction route of these highly virulent PEDV strains could not be finally elucidated22, 23. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the causative strains cluster together with the above mentioned Chinese isolates from 2011 and 201224\u201326. With the disease threatening to spread, European farmers and veterinarians were alerted and asked for data on PED prevalence and possible impact. Consequently, surveillance in Europe was reinforced and PED cases were indeed reported from Central Europe i.e. Germany27, the Ukraine28, France29, Austria30, Portugal31 and Belgium32. In Germany, cases were reported starting from May 2014 especially in the South-Western and North-Western part25, 27, 33. In general, the impact on the pig industry remained low. Retrospective analyses demonstrated that a considerable seroprevalence was present only in Italy34. Thus, a recent re-introduction is most likely.",

On the one hand there are so called \u201coriginal US PEDV\u201d, which are commonly referred to as NON-INDEL strains (meaning no insertions and deletions in the open reading frame (ORF) encoding for the spike protein), and on the other hand so called \u201cS-INDEL\u201d variants that show insertions and deletions in spike protein encoding region35. The latter were supposed to cause milder disease course with low mortality. With exception of PEDV strains from Ukraine28, the current European strains were identified as S-INDEL strains closely related to OH851 from the U.S.25. However, field virulence and mortality rates differed between European countries with low overall impact25, 28, 29, 33, 36. In Germany, mortality ranged from almost zero to more than 70% in suckling pigs with almost complete genetic identity of the causative PEDV strains25, 33. Here we report about our studies of both the virulence of recent S-INDEL PEDV strains from Central Europe under controlled laboratory conditions, and the protective effect of maternally derived antibodies (MDA). Up to now, PED control is mainly achieved by strict veterinary hygiene and biosecurity, and vaccination is not practiced outside of Asia and - more recently - America. However, taking into account the current threats, vaccination strategies are revisited. To protect the most susceptible host, the suckling pig, mainly a sow vaccination concept seems reasonable. A prerequisite would be a solid protection through maternally derived antibodies (MDA).",

In a nutshell, the PEDV strains obtained from recent German outbreaks (both cell culture and field material) showed indeed a low virulence with only two MDA-negative piglets that had to be euthanized at the humane endpoint. All remaining piglets recovered completely and were able to compensate the weight loss by the weaning age. However, piglets with MDA were almost completely protected from clinical disease. In direct comparison, the field material induced more severe signs in na\u00efve piglets than the cell culture isolate. Possible reasons include attenuation by cell culture adaptation but also differences in inoculation dose and secondary pathogens. Regarding the inoculation dose, it can be stated that the genome load was higher in the cell culture material than in the field material. Provided that this gives at least an indication for the virus titer, we can assume that the virus titer of the field material was at least not considerably higher than that of the cell culture material. Testing of the field materials for secondary pathogens showed low rotavirus A and enterovirus loads. The secondary materials used for the inoculation of the piglets in groups B1 and B2 contained PEDV and low PEV genome loads. The latter was however not found in any of the piglets.",

Disease progression in these sows was worse than the disease course in the sows following direct inoculation prior to farrowing (groups A1 and B1). Diarrhea and depression even led to a severe decrease of milk production and thus inadequate nutrition of piglets. This underlines the importance of the sow\u2019s health status for the fate of PED-diseased piglets. The increased severity could probably be explained by the more fragile immune system during the farrowing and lactating period, but also with the higher virus loads in the stable and ongoing contact to PEDV shed by the infected piglets39.",

This is prerequisite for a sow vaccination strategy which should be explored in light of the tremendous impact of PED in the US and also farms in the Ukraine. With neonatal piglets being born agammaglobulinemic and possessing limited, undeveloped lymphoid tissues and no effector and memory T-lymphocytes41, it is absolutely necessary that they receive maternal cell-mediated and humoral immune components through the ingestion of colostrum and milk42. It is already shown for TGEV that natural oral infection of sows leads to a more effective maternal derived lactogenic protection for suckling pigs than systemic immunization43, 44. This effect is mainly based on a larger amount of secretory IgA in colostrum and milk because of stimulation of the gut-mammary-axis of the sow. Systemic immunization usually induces high levels of IgG in both the blood and colostrum, but IgA titers in blood might stay on a low level offering no reliable lactogenic protection against infection of piglets45. This is in line with the results of the provided study, in which high amounts of IgG could be detected in colostrum but not in milk samples, whereas IgA could be found in both \u2013 colostrum of pre-infected sows and milk of all sows. Thus, also the sows that stayed na\u00efve prior to farrowing seroconverted upon challenge of their piglets and low levels of IgA could be detected in milk samples at the end of the trial. When revisiting PED vaccination, this route-dependent issue should be kept in mind as it could explain the unsatisfactory protection against virus shedding and morbidity of piglets from sows that were only parenterally immunized using different types of vaccines46.",

Sows pre-exposed prior to farrowing showed already decreasing levels of IgG at the end of the trial (with ELISA results still being positive). With a high antibody titer in the blood being a requirement for solid and protective antibody titers \u2013 especially secretory IgA - in colostrum and milk, it seems that sows would have to be re-vaccinated/re-infected prior to each farrowing to ensure piglet protection. Moreover, immunization is needed close to the farrowing date. From literature it is known that antibody levels of IgG and IgA in serum of primiparous and multiparous sows can remain stable up to 6 months post field infection as measured by high titers in ELISA and virus neutralization assay49. The respective sows were obtained from commercial breeding farms that had reported previous PED outbreaks. Thus, booster/reinfection seems to play a role for the duration of immunity. With regard to piglets, field studies observed antibody levels in piglets that lasted up to 100 days49, 50. For the piglets/young weaners, the source of antibodies clearly influences the duration of detection. While a decay of MDA is visible already after a few weeks, antibodies induced by active immunization or infection might last much longer. In our study, MDA-positive animals had only low antibody levels by the end of the trial (at the age of weaning). In these animals, protection in later stages of pig production would have been questionable and this could explain field observations that showed reinfection of finishing pigs that had been exposed to PEDV as suckling pigs. These aspects also need consideration when designing a vaccination concept.",

According to EU legislation, the animals were kept in open pens in sets of two before they were moved to commercial farrowing pens one week before farrowing. Two farrowing pens were integrated in one stable room so that each experimental group could be kept together. All animals had access to water ad libitum and were fed with commercial feed for breeding sows and after farrowing for lactating sows. All applicable animal welfare regulations, including EU-Directive 2010/63/EC and institutional guidelines, were taken into consideration. The animal experiment was approved by the competent authority, Landesamt f\u00fcr Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (LALLF MV), under reference number LALLF 7221.3-1-059/16.",

The initial isolate was obtained using the following (standard) protocol: 5 \u00d7 105 Vero cells were seeded into 6-wells plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, confluent monolayers were obtained and the cell culture medium was removed. All wells were washed three times with 3 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

After the addition of 2 ml of PEDV media containing 15 \u00b5g/ml trypsin, cultures were incubated for 24\u201348 h at 37\u00b0C. The cultures were checked daily for the presence of characteristic fusion formation, and positive materials were further passaged.
