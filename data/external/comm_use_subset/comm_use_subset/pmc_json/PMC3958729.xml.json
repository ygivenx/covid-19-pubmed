Most of the prediction models abounded in the literature can mainly be classified into two categories, namely, econometric models (casual model) and time series models. In the econometrics community, traditional research has been focusing on the economic factors of the take-off and landing point, such as population, income, and price [1\u20135]. It should be noted that most econometric models aimed to reveal the underlying relationship between air passengers traffic flow and selected variables such as geoeconomic and service-related factors. Due to the complexity of econometric modeling in variables selection, time series approach is a promising alternative in air passengers traffic prediction [6]. However, these traditional time series methods always do not work in practice. The main reason is that the underlying assumption of these traditional time series methods is linearity and they cannot capture the nonlinear patterns hidden and recognize the irregularity well. Recent research focuses on modeling time series with complex nonlinearity, dynamic variation, and high irregularity [7\u201314].",

Chen proposed a hybrid methodology that exploits the unique strength of the SARIMA (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average) model and the support vector machines model in forecasting Taiwan's machinery industry production values. And Guo developed a hybrid Seasonal Autoregression Integrated Moving Average and Least Square Support Vector Machine (SARIMA-LSSVM) model to predict the mean monthly wind speed in Hexi Corridor, which shows that the developed method is simple and quite efficient. Additionally, Zhang combined the ARIMA and feedforward neural networks models in forecasting [18].",

As such, this hybrid approach can take full advantages of the unique strength of ARIMA and SVM models in linear and nonlinear modeling, respectively. However, an important point to note from the past studies mentioned above is their preoccupation with one-step-ahead forecasting rather than the multistep-ahead one. In one-step-ahead case, the predictor uses all or some of the observations to estimate a variable of interests for the time step immediately following the latest observation. However, it provides no information as to the long-term future behavior of air passengers traffic.",

The monthly air passengers traffic series from four airlines are used for the purpose of validation. The experimental results are judged on the basis of the prediction accuracy and the computational cost. The first contribution of this paper is that the proposed modeling framework is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of air passenger traffic considered, resulting in a more accuracy multistep-ahead prediction. The second contribution is to provide the first strong empirical evidence within the air passengers traffic literature on whether the superiority of ARIMA-SVMs modeling framework holds consistently in the case of multistep-ahead prediction. Last but not least, the third contribution is to provide the experimental evidence on the performance of different multistep-ahead prediction strategies, which may shed lights on the selection of modeling strategy while facing the different time horizons upon prediction.",

In the first stage, an ARIMA model is used to analyze the linear part of the problem for each step. In the second stage, SVMs model is developed to model the residuals from the ARIMA model. Since the ARIMA model cannot capture the nonlinear structure of the data, the residuals of linear model will contain information about the nonlinearity. Assuming y\nt (t = 1,2,\u2026, n) is the original data set and according to ARIMA-SVMs model, y\nt includes the linear part L\nt and nonlinear part N\nt, namely, y\nt = L\nt + N\nt. First of all, H-step ahead prediction by ARIMA model will be employed and obtain the H-step ahead forecasted value L~t+h, then for each time t, the residuals of y\nt+h can be obtained by \u03b5t+h=yt+h-L~t+h. And for nonlinear time series \u03b5\nt (t = 1,2,\u2026, n), H-step ahead prediction by SVMs model will be employed and obtain the H-step ahead forecasted values N~t+h, the ultimate forecasted time series for y\nt+h is y~t+h, which consist of L~t+h and N~t+h. In this research, two multistep-ahead forecasting strategies will be employed, namely, iterated strategy and direct strategy, and it should be noted that if the multistep-ahead strategy has been selected for linear part, the same strategy should be employed in nonlinear part; therefore, the model should be ARIMA (iterated strategy)-SVMs(iterated strategy) or ARIMA(direct strategy)-SVMs(direct strategy).",

The input subset is chosen by a predefined criterion, which measures the relationship of each subset of input variables with the output [26]. Specifically, in terms of input selection criteria, the partial mutual information [27] is used for the prediction models. Mutual information (MI) is a commonly adopted measure of dependence between variables and has been widely used for input selection [26]. However, this raises a major redundancy issue because the MI criterion does not account for the interdependency between candidate variables. To address this issue, Sharma [27] developed an improved algorithm that exploits the concept of partial mutual information (PMI), which is the nonlinear statistical analog of partial correlation. The definitions of PMI are shown as follows:\n(22)PMI=\u222cfX\u2032,Y\u2032(x\u2032,y\u2032)log\u2061e\u2061[fX\u2032,Y\u2032(x\u2032,y\u2032)fX\u2032(x\u2032)fY\u2032(y\u2032)]dx\u2032dy\u2032,\nwhere\n(23)x\u2032=x\u2212E[x \u2223 z],y\u2032=y\u2212E[y \u2223 z],\nwhere X\u2032 and Y\u2032 are generalized to represent time series x(t) and lagged time x(t \u2212 i) with time step i  (i \u2264 d) conditional on Z which is a set of remaining time-lag variables. In performing the PMI, the input variable with highest conditional PMI value at every iteration can be added to the inputs set.",

The first is the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) defined as (25), and the second is symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) defined as (26), and the last accuracy measure is the mean absolute scaled error (MASE), defined as (27). MAPE has the advantage of being scale-independent and so is frequently used to compare forecast performance across different datasets. Moreover, the MAPE also has the disadvantage that it puts a heavier penalty on positive errors than on negative errors. MASE has recently been suggested by Hyndman and Koehler [30] as a means of overcoming observation and errors around zero existing in some measures. The MASE has some features which are better than the SMAPE, which has been criticized for the fact that its treatment of positive and negative errors is not symmetric [31]. However, the MAPE and SMAPE are still used in this study due to their popularity in forecasting literature. The smaller the values of MAPE, SMAPE, and MASE, the closer the predicted time series values to the actual values.

Due to its simplicity and generality as no important modification was made for applying it to model selection, PSO has been recently established for parameter determination of SVR. In solving hyperparameter selection by the PSO, each particle is requested to represent a potential solution (C, \u03b5, \u03b3). Fortunately, several empirical and theoretical studies have been performed about the parameters of PSO from which valuable information can be obtained [36]. In this study, the parameters are determined according to the recommendations in these studies and selected based on the prediction performance and computational time in a trial-error fashion. Through experiments, the parameter values of PSO are set as follows. Both the cognitive and interaction coefficients are set to 2. The swarm size and number of iterations are set to be 10 and 50, respectively.",
