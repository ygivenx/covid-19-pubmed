The whole genome of DdCoV/GD/2014 was amplified through RT-PCR with a series of primers (see S1 Table). The primers were designed according to the conserved regions in the genomes of the CoVs in genus Gammacoronavirus and the regions having been sequenced through NGS [12]. The RT-PCR reactions were performed in a 50-\u03bcl reaction system with incubation at 42\u00b0C for 30 min and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 60 s, followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u201355\u00b0C (largely depending on the Tm values of the primers) for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1\u20134 min (depending on the length of the amplicons). RT-PCR products were purified with an agarose gel DNA extraction kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China). The amplicons were purified using an agarose gel DNA extraction kit (Takara, Dalian, China) and ligated into the pEASY-T1 cloning vector (TransGen, Beijing, China). Positive clones were sequenced by the ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer using the pair of M13 primers from both senses. Sequences were assembled and edited manually to generate the whole genome sequence which was further compared to those of IBVs. The DdCoV genome sequence was annotated manually.",

These 3583 samples were collected from 28 live poultry markets (LPMs), 14 duck farms, and two backyard flocks in May and June of 2014 mainly for surveillance of avian influenza viruses, Newcastle disease viruses and CoVs circulating in poultry in China. The swab sample was collected through taking smears at both cloacal and oropharyngeal tracts of a bird. The feces sample was collected through taking approximately 0.5 ml wet and fresh feces. The drinking-water sample was collected through taking approximately 3.5 ml drinking-water for a group of birds. The swab samples were stored in 1.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol, and the feces samples were stored in 3.5 ml PBS (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol, and the drinking-water samples were stored with 0.4 ml glycerol.

Therefore, it is surprising to identify a tandem repeat in the genomes of DdCoVs in this study. To our knowledge, of all known vertebrate RNA viruses, tandem repeats have been identified only in the genomes of some human HKU1 CoVs which contain 2 to 17 copies of a 10-aa peptide (NDDEDVVTGD) with unknown origin and functions [7]. The tandem repeats in both DdCoVs and HKU1 CoVs are located at highly variable regions in the PL1pro domain of nsp3. Because nsp3 is not essential for the virus replicating in cultured cells [8], and tandem repeats do not exist in many other CoVs, these tandem repeats may be of little importance for the virus replicating in cultured cells. On the other hand, as tandem repeats have not been identified in any known vertebrate RNA viruses except in two species of CoVs, CoVs might have an intrinsic inclination to generate tandem repeats.",
