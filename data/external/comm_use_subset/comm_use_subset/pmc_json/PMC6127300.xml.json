PRDC is multifactorial in origin, with both infectious and non-infectious factors contributing to the respiratory disease it causes, which is predominantly seen in pigs of 1 to 3 months of age2,3. The onset of respiratory disease on piglet farms is thought to be related to the initial stress of piglet transportation to the farms, after which a primary viral insult causes a secondary infection from the bacteria resident in these animals1,4. Hence, based on their ability to damage the upper airway epithelium, injure the lung parenchyma and promote secondary bacterial colonization, the primary viral pathogens are able to influence the development and outcome of PRDC5.",

Genetic recombination and mutation are the most common generators of genetic diversity in organisms and the emergence of novel PRRSV, PCV-2 and SIV strains increases the difficulty of clinical diagnosis and disease control against such viruses7\u20139. Several novel viruses have been discovered in diseased piglets with PRDC, including novel parvoviruses, bocaviruses and torque teno sus virus (TTSuV)10\u201314. However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PRDC remains unclear. To complicate matters further, the viral pathogens associated with respiratory diseases in pigs vary significantly among farms, production sites, regions and countries, making generalisations about how to treat and control PRDC difficult1. Hence, establishing accurate diagnostic criteria for PRDC is critical for implementing the most appropriate treatment and control regimens against it on farms.",

However, on intensive commercial farms, the viral communities associated with PRDC are largely unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to characterize the viromes from serum and nasal swabs collected from piglets with acute PRDC in Sichuan province, China. We also examined the detection rates for viruses identified in animals with PRDC and location-matched the rates with clinically healthy controls to determine which respiratory viruses are associated with PRDC.",

The contigs from these viruses were de novo assembled using SOAP assembly software, from which six complete or near full-length genome sequences (PPV-2, PPV-3, PPV-4, PPV-5, PPV-6, and PCV-2), were assembled using the corresponding viral sequence contigs (Table 1).(i)PPV-2. A total of 1,535 reads with sequence identities corresponding to PPV-2 were detected in the libraries prepared from the serum and nasal swabs. A near complete genome sequence of 5,438 bp long and covering 98.9% of the whole genome sequence was assembled from the PPV-2 isolates (Table 1). The sequence identity scores for PPV-2 were 94.8% to 97.3% when compared with 15 PPV-2 GenBank reference sequences. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the assembled PPV-2 isolates have distant genetic relationships with the 15 other PPV-2 viruses (Fig. 2a), and are located in a unique cluster. This result suggests that the PPV-2 virus identified herein has a novel genotype.(ii)PPV-3. Deep sequencing, which provided 100% coverage of the total genome length for PPV-3, generated 13,554 sequence reads related to this virus. The full-genome sequence assembled for the PPV-3 isolates revealed that the PPV-3 genome is 5,081 bp in length, with a GC content of 51.56%. The virus shares 96.8% to 99.1% nucleotide sequence similarity with 27 GenBank PPV-3 reference sequences. The phylogenetic tree constructed for the PPV-3 isolates and the 27 PPV-3 GenBank genome sequences (Fig. 2b) revealed that PPV-3 is closely related to GX1 and GX2, two novel PPV-3 isolates identified in tonsil samples from piglets in China20.(iii)PPV-4. PPV-4 was identified via 2,052 sequence reads. The complete viral genome sequence we assembled was 5,908 bp in length, with a GC content of 42.5%. The assembled PPV-4 virus shares 98.1% to 99.6% sequence identity with 14 PPV-4 reference sequences from GenBank. In the phylogenetic tree, the PPV-4 isolates evidently share close genetic relationships with the clone 17 strain from the USA (Fig. 2c)21.(iv)PPV-5. PPV-5 was identified via 3,100 sequence reads by deep sequencing of the sera samples. The complete genome sequence (97.2%) for the PPV-5 isolates, which was assembled from a 5,458 bp sequence (Table 1), shares high sequence similarities (97.0% to 99.5%) with 13 PPV-5 GenBank reference strains. Further analysis of the phylogenetic tree indicated that the PPV-5 isolates share close relationships with both of the USA-isolated clone 1 and 2 IA469 strains22 (Fig. 2d).(v)PPV-6. Analysis of 17,906 sequence reads showed that they were closely related to PPV-6 genomic sequences. The complete genome sequence we obtained for the PPV-6 isolates (Table 1) is 6,199 bp in length, with a GC content of 46.87%. It shares a high level of sequence identity (97.4% to 99.6%) with 23 PPV-6 GenBank reference strains. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to assess the genetic evolutionary aspects of the assembled PPV-6 isolates with respect to the 23 GenBank PPV-6 isolates (Fig. 2e). The results show that the virus shares close genetic relationships with KSU3-KS-2014 and KSU1-AZ-2014 strains, which were first identified in 2015 in PRRSV-positive piglet serum in the USA10.(vi)PCV-2. We identified 28 sequences that are closely related to PCV-2 in the serum samples and nasal swabs by deep sequencing. The 1,310 bp sequence we assembled covers 74.1% of the total genome length (Table 1), and encodes the capsid protein and a partial replicase protein. The partial PCV-2 genome shares 95.9% to 99.4% sequence identity with the 35 reference PCV-2 genomes in GenBank. Based on a sequence motif in the capsid protein, five genotypes (a, b, c, d, and e) have been described for PCV-223. The phylogenetic tree we constructed to discern the evolutionary relationships between the assembled PCV-2 sequence and the 35 other genotypically distinct PCV-2 reference strains showed that although the assembled virus fell into the PCV-2e group, it was located in a unique cluster (Fig. 2f).",

Thus, NADC30-like PRRSV was the main strain circulating in China, a result consistent with some reports on the molecular epidemiology of the NADC30-like strain in recent years25,26. Furthermore, co-infections with different PRRSV genotypes were highly prevalent in piglets with PRDC, and the most frequent co-infections involved NADC30-like PRRSV and HP-PRRSV(10/26), which shows that the prevalence of PRRSVs is more complex and diverse in piglets with PRDC in Sichuan province, China.",

The results of the PCR-based, case-control study are shown in Tables 3 and S2. With the individual serum samples, on average, 6.81 different viruses were shed by the 36 PRDC-affected piglets, revealing a high prevalence of viral co-infections in these respiratory-diseased piglets. In contrast, the mean value for the 38 clinically healthy controls showed that 4.09 distinct viruses were shed into the serum samples.

In this study, 17 different viruses were identified in the samples collected from nasal swabs and sera from 26 PRDC-affected piglets, which shows that the viral communities in these animals were complex and diverse. A greater number of viral species were identified than those reported in previous studies18,28. Furthermore, differences in the viral flora were observed in the serum (16 viruses) and nasal swab (nine viruses) libraries from the diseased piglets, a finding possibly related to the effectiveness of the different sampling methods at fully identifying the viral categories. This discrepancy has also been observed in dairy calves with respiratory diseases29. Furthermore, the tissue distribution of the viruses may differ over their infection periods. Seventeen distinct viral sequences were detected in the lung samples from the 26 piglets, suggesting that the lungs might be a useful reference organ for a sampling method aimed at identifying the viruses associated with PRDC by metagenomics, and we have previously used lung samples to identify viromes with this technique. Nevertheless, a large proportion of the genome sequences from the host were present in the library, and few viral sequences were detected in the lung samples. Therefore, more efficient techniques are needed for the removal of host nucleic acids from samples to allow greater recovery of the widest range of viral flora from the lungs of PRDC-affected piglets.",

The viral pathogens associated with PRDC differ significantly among farms, production sites, regions and countries1,3,4,30. Hence, developing an unbiased identification scheme for viral communities is essential for implementing effective control regimens against PRDC on farms. One feature of PRDC is its association with co-infections containing multiple viruses2,18. In the present study, we identified at least 17 different viruses by PCR in the 26 piglets with PRDC. We found evidence of co-infections with at least five different viruses in the lung samples and, notably, co-infections with 11 different viruses were detected in one sample, which highlights the high prevalence of co-infections and diverse viral communities in porcine respiratory disease in China. We also found that PCV-2\u2013PRRSV co-infections in the lung samples from the PRDC-affected piglets were significantly higher in number than those of the other viruses, which is in agreement with previous studies on PRDC2,9. However, the low abundance or complete absence of PCV-2 and PRRSV in the serum and nasal swabs, as determined by metagenomics, is likely to be related to the different sampling methods that were used and the viral distribution in these samples. Furthermore, co-infections with PRRSV significantly increase PCV-2 viremia and enhance the severity of piglet respiratory disease31. Therefore, these results suggest that both PCV-2 and PRRSV play important roles in the development and outcome of PRDC.",

In this study, when the distribution of the sequences arising from the 17 viruses in the serum samples was compared between the animals with PRDC and the clinically healthy controls, 6.81 and 4.09 viruses on average were detected per sample from the PRDC-affected animals and the clinically healthy controls, respectively. Shedding of six or more distinct viruses was also associated with PRDC infections. Co-infections with a large number of viruses might therefore overcome piglet innate immune defenses1,32. Single infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV, or co-infections with them both, had significantly higher detection rates than those for the other viruses in the PRDC-affected piglets, indicating that these two pathogens may be closely associated with the occurrence of PRDC in piglets. Interestingly, statistical analysis of the association between virus detection in the PRDC cases and the clinically healthy controls revealed that the novel viruses PPV-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and TTSuV-1a were each associated with PRDC and might, therefore, be risk factors for contracting PRDC.",

In the present study, most of the viruses identified in the diseased piglets by viral metagenomics were small linear and circular DNA viruses. Notably, the genome sequences from novel viral genotypes were successfully assembled and their biological identification suggests that viral evolution is far more complicated in piglets with PRDC than previously thought. Among the identified viruses, PPV-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and TTSuV-1a are strongly associated with PRDC; however, the pathogenesis of these viruses is still unclear in piglets with respiratory disease. In clinical analyses, PPV-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and TTSuV-1a often appear in co-infections with PCV-2 in diseased piglets with PRDC or postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome10,35\u201337. Therefore, the ability to identify the novel viruses associated with PRDC is important for further studies on this disease, including the replication of our study using animals co-infected with other pathogens, animals from different herds and ultimately following herd vaccination to measure the impact of reducing the level of viral infections.",

In parallel, all useful sequence reads were subjected to de novo contig assembly using SOAP assembly software (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/) with the criterion of a 90% minimum overlap identity. Individual viral contigs from both pools were reassembled into a larger contig or genome sequence using high-level sequence identity criteria.
