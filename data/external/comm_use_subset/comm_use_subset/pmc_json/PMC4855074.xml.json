The 5\u2032 most two-thirds of MERS-CoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are further cleaved to yield 16 non-structural proteins, whereas the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes several structural or lineage-specific proteins.13 Upon infection, these proteins are expressed to facilitate viral replication and propagation in the host.14 MERS-CoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, in patients as well as in animal and cellular infection models.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 This has been attributed to the IFN-antagonizing property of some MERS-CoV-encoded proteins, which directly perturb the host IFN production mechanisms,22, 23, 24, 25, 26 lending support to the notion that MERS-CoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response.",

In a comparative analysis of MERS-CoV structural and accessory proteins, it has been shown that M, ORF4a, ORF4b and ORF5 possess IFN-antagonizing properties.22 We, and others, have characterized the ORF4a protein as a dsRNA-binding protein that interferes with the activation of RLR by either a dsRNA ligand or the protein co-activator PACT.24, 25 However, the molecular mechanisms through which other MERS-CoV proteins manipulate the RLR signaling pathway to disrupt IFN-\u03b2 expression have not been elucidated.",

Coronavirus M protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized predominantly to the Golgi complex and is required for virion assembly.30, 31, 32 MERS-CoV M protein is of particular interest because SARS-CoV M protein also inhibits IFN production through a mechanism by which the formation of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK-\u025b complex is impeded to ablate the activation of IRF3 transcription factor.30 In contrast, M protein encoded by human coronavirus HKU1 associated with common cold has no influence on IFN production.32 Here we reported that the MERS-CoV M protein also specifically inhibited IRF3 activation but not NF-\u03baB signaling. MERS-CoV M protein was capable of interacting with TRAF3 adapter protein and hampered TRAF3\u2013TBK1 interaction leading to diminished IRF3 activation. Using a chimeric protein containing the MERS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a dormant SARS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain, we confirmed that the N-terminal transmembrane domains of MERS-CoV M protein sufficiently account for its inhibitory effect. Although another chimera containing SARS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a MERS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain was fully competent in IFN antagonism, a truncation mutant lacking the functional first transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV M was not, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV M protein is largely dispensable for its immunosuppressive activity.",

To address this issue, two different luciferase reporter constructs, in which tandem copies of either IRF3- or NF-\u03baB-binding elements were inserted into their promoter region, were used. The truncation mutant of RIG-I known as RIG-I N that contains only the N-terminal CARD domain was chosen to be the inducer in these assays because it is constitutively active and highly competent to induce these two pathways.28 The MERS-CoV M protein was able to suppress the promoter activity of the IRF3-driven luciferase construct in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A; bars 3\u20135 compared with bar 2), but no inhibitory effect was observed with the NF-\u03baB-driven construct (Figure 2B; bars 3\u20135 compared with bar 2) although the canonical inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 could efficiently blunt its activation as a positive control (Figure 2B; bar 6 compared with bar 2). Hence, the suppressive effect of the MERS-CoV M protein is specific for IRF3 signaling but not NF-\u03baB activation.",

The activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect. As described above, RIG-I N is a constitutively active mutant that resembles immediate activation of virus sensor RIG-I after the detection of viral infection. Although the M protein could mildly suppress IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation induced by RIG-I N at a marginally significant level, a dose-dependent effect was coarsely observed (Figure 3A; bars 3\u20135 compared with bar 2). A similar result was also obtained using MAVS as an activator (Figure 3B; bars 3\u20135 compared with bar 2), which is a mitochondrial adapter that diverts the activation signal from RIG-I to the IRF3 and NF-\u03baB pathways.44, 45, 46, 47 When activators committed to the IRF3 pathway were used, greater inhibitory effects were observed, as in the cases of TBK1 (Figure 3C; bars 3\u20135 compared with bar 2) and IKK-\u025b (Figure 3D; bars 3\u20135 compared with bar 2), which are kinases which recognize and phosphorylate IRF3 as direct substrate.48, 49, 50, 51 Surprisingly, when a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 transcription factor (IRF3 5D), with five inducible phosphorylation sites at Ser/Thr residues mutated to Asp,52 was employed, the expression of the M protein no longer quenched the IRF3-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Figure 3E), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation.",

When the inducer RIG-I N was exclusively co-expressed with IRF3, the detection of an additional slow-migrating band indicated the activation and dimerization of IRF3, which would otherwise be entirely in its monomeric form in the absence of any activator (Figure 4C; lane 2 compared with lane 1). Interestingly, when M protein was expressed, the signal reflecting the dimeric form of IRF3 molecules was significantly diminished, even though the total IRF3 level expressed in all samples was highly comparable as detected by conventional denaturing SDS-PAGE (Figure 4C; lower panel for SDS-PAGE), suggesting that IRF3 activation was greatly inhibited by the MERS-CoV M protein.

This truncation mutant, designated SN \u0394TM1, contains only the second and the third transmembrane domains of SARS-CoV M protein at the N terminus fused with the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M protein (Figure 5E; upper panel). While the full-length chimeric SN protein was fully competent in suppressing IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity induced by TBK1, the removal of the first transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV M largely abolished its inhibitory capability (Figure 5E; bottom-left panel, bar 4 compared with bar 3), although both proteins were expressed to a detectable level in cells (Figure 5E; bottom-right panel). It is therefore proposed that the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M protein is devoid of and largely dispensable for the IFN-antagonizing activity of MERS-CoV M protein.",

This innate immunosuppressive activity of the MERS-CoV M protein was due to its conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains. Our mechanistic study complemented the previous work that showed that MERS-CoV M protein had IFN-antagonizing activity.22 Both studies demonstrated that MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IRF3 activity but not NF-\u03baB signaling. It is known that the activation of RIG-I and MAVS results in the activation of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB.28, 44, 45, 46 Our results indicated that the MERS-CoV M protein was capable of differentially suppressing the RIG-I-induced activation of IRF3 (Figure 2). This provides further support to the bifurcation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB signaling subsequent to RIG-I and MAVS activation. Further investigations should elucidate the mechanism by which the MERS-CoV M protein preferentially modulates IRF3 activators such as TBK1, while sparing NF-\u03baB activators such as CARD9.47 We provided evidence that the TRAF3\u2013TBK1 interaction as well as IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization were affected by the MERS-CoV M protein (Figure 4). Our findings fill the knowledge gap by providing novel mechanistic insight into the innate immunosuppressive activity of MERS-CoV M protein.",

The MERS-CoV M protein is a transmembrane protein that was shown to co-localize with markers of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013Golgi intermediate compartments in the perinuclear area.22 Although TRAF3 is known to adapt the mitochondrial transducer MAVS, it is not associated with mitochondria but rather with the Golgi apparatus and ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartments in unstimulated conditions,30, 54 rendering it susceptible to interaction with the MERS-CoV M protein. Upon stimulation with ligands or viral infection, TRAF3 appears on membrane-bound fragments originating from Golgi. Retention of TRAF3 in ER-to-Golgi compartments and inability to form Golgi fragments rendered IFN-\u03b2 expression inefficient.54 Therefore, whether TRAF3-containing Golgi fragment formation is affected by MERS-CoV M protein warrants further analysis. This may serve as a novel mechanism by which virus-encoded proteins counteract host IFN production.",

On one hand, the development of relevant prophylactic and therapeutic agents has been well under way.55, 56, 57 On the other hand, the identification of the pathogenic factors in these viruses is also in full swing. The M protein is a pathogenic factor by virtue of its IFN-antagonizing property. Both the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV M proteins were found to suppress IFN production with a highly similar mechanism in which the IRF3-phosphorylating complex of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK-\u025b was affected by their N-terminal transmembrane domains.30, 32 Interestingly, in the case of community-acquired human coronavirus HKU1, which normally causes common cold in infected individuals, its M protein showed no IFN antagonistic property,32 further supporting the importance of the M protein in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Using a side-by-side comparison of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M proteins, we discovered that the extent by which the MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity was lower than that by SARS-CoV M protein. This difference might be explained by the strengths of the interaction of MERS-CoV M protein with other transducers. Whereas the MERS-CoV M protein was found to be strongly associated with TRAF3, its interaction with TBK1 or IKK-\u025b was undetectable (data not shown). This distinguished MERS-CoV M protein from the SARS-CoV M protein, which interacts potently with every component of the TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK-\u025b complex.30 Further investigations are required to shed light on how the interaction of the M protein with TRAF3 complex might influence MERS-CoV pathogenesis.",
