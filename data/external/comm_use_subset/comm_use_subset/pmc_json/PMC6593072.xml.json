            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which has been endemic to Saudi Arabia since 2012 (Danielsson et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2012; Assiri et al., 2013; De Groot et al., 2013; Azhar et al., 2014). As of May 22, 2019, there have been 2,428 confirmed cases in 27 countries, resulting in 838 deaths [The World Health Organization (WHO), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/]. The dromedary camel is the primary reservoir of MERS-CoV, with evidence of circulating virus in camels in Saudi Arabia since at least 1992 (Hemida et al., 2013; Kupferschmidt, 2013; Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014). MERS-CoV is transmitted to humans through close contact with dromedaries, suggesting that MERS is a zoonotic disease (Azhar et al., 2014). The seropositive rate in dromedary camels is quite high in the Middle East and in Northern and Eastern African countries (Hemida et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2014; Miguel et al., 2017; Fukushi et al., 2018; Harcourt et al., 2018), with lower rates seen outside of these regions, ranging from 30 to 50% in Tunisia to only 4.1 to 13% in the Canary Islands (Reusken et al., 2014; Gutierrez et al., 2015). Furthermore, dromedaries in Australia and Japan have been shown to be free of MERS-CoV infection (Hemida et al., 2014; Shirato et al., 2015).",

In a test of patient exposure, Liljander et al. (2016) reported two cases of seropositivity among 1,122 specimens tested in 2013 to 2014 in Kenya. However, this seropositivity rate among patients in Kenya (0.18%) was similar to that observed in Saudi Arabia (0.15%; Muller et al., 2015), suggesting similar rates of exposure between populations. Differences in access to public health facilities between the regions have been proposed as a possible explanation for this wide disparity in MERS-CoV cases (Liljander et al., 2016), but a definitive cause remains unclear. Although underreporting may account for some differences in reporting rates, we hypothesized that virological differences between African and Middle Eastern MERS-CoV strains may play a role in human MERS-CoV infection. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the viral properties of African MERS-CoV obtained from nasal specimens of young dromedaries (\u22642 years old) in the Afar region of Ethiopia, paying special attention to the spike (S) protein.",

The punched cards were then resuspended in AVE buffer from the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. MERS-CoV RNA was detected using two QProbe RT-LAMP assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) and open reading frame (ORF) 1a (Shirato et al., 2018b) and two Corman\u2019s real-time RT-PCR assays (upE and ORF1a; Corman et al., 2012a,b). According to the WHO case definition, detection of at least two distinct genomic targets is required for a positive diagnosis [WHO, GAR, Revised interim case definition for reporting to WHO \u2013 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), updated on July 3, 2013, http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/index.html]. The regions targeted by the four primer sets included in the Corman\u2019s assays and QProbe RT-LAMP assays were different, and their positions in EMC isolates were as follows: upE (27,458\u201327,502), Corman\u2019s ORF1a (11,197\u201311,252), N (28,848\u201329,061), and LAMP ORF1a (1,572\u20131,753; Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, a positive result in at least two of these four tests fulfilled the WHO criteria, and these specimens were considered positive for MERS-CoV. In this study, two QProbe RT-LAMP assays were performed as the first screening test because they can detect Ethiopian MERS-CoV RNA within 30 min, using lyophilized reagent and a battery-driven portable tube scanner (ESEQuant TS2; Qiagen) without a large real-time RT-PCR instrument. Specimens that showed positivity on both QProbe RT-LAMP assays were considered positive for MERS-CoV. After RT-LAMP screening, specimens positive for either N or ORF1a were retested by real-time RT-PCR targeting upE and ORF1a in equipped laboratory. Specimens that were positive on at least one of the Corman\u2019s assays were also considered positive for MERS-CoV, because these specimens had positive detection of more than two different genetic targets.",

Recombinant MERS-CoVs were generated by a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone carrying the full-length infectious genome of the EMC isolate (designated as pBAC-MERS-wt), as described previously (Terada et al., 2017; Matsuyama et al., 2018) with modifications. The S protein sequences of the Amibara isolates were synthesized in two fragments by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then inserted into the pKS336 vector (Saijo et al., 2002) using the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Plasmids containing the chimeric S proteins replaced between the EMC and Amibara S sequences at the first furin site (amino acid positions 748\u2013751 in the S protein, see Supplementary Figure S2), which marks the boundary of the S1 and S2 regions, were constructed.

As 17 specimens were positive for a single gene in the RT-LAMP assays, they were further analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assays (upE and ORF1a), which revealed four additional positive specimens, for a final positivity rate of 15.1% (39 of 258 specimens) for MERS-CoV. These results were similar to those of the Ethiopian MERS study reported by Miguel et al. (2017), with all positive specimens detected in Amibara in the Afar region.",

Therefore, FTA Classic Cards were used in this study to fix the specimens immediately at each pastoral farm in Ethiopia. RNA extraction from the specimens was performed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and then sequencing analysis was performed in Japan. Therefore, the RNAs were fragmented and could not be used for PCR amplification for next generation sequencing analysis as described by Cotten et al. (2013). To determine the genomic sequences in these specimens, RNA sequencing was performed. Among the 39 positive specimens, 12 were readily detected at early time points by RT-LAMP, suggesting high viral titers. Of these 12 specimens, nearly full-length genome sequences were detected in two specimens using MiSeq. These two specimens were then subjected to HiSeq analysis to increase the accuracy and reliability of the sequences. Finally, two independent genome sequences were obtained and designated camel/MERS/Amibara/118/2017 (MK564474) and camel/MERS/Amibara/126/2017 (MK564475). Phylogenetic analyses performed using full-length sequences showed that the Amibara isolates clustered alongside clade C isolates, with further sub-clustering into C2 alongside other Ethiopian isolates (Figure 2A). Chu et al. reported that West African MERS-CoV harbored a >360 nucleotide deletion in ORF4b relative to the EMC isolate (Chu et al., 2018). By contrast, the Amibara isolates had only two amino acids deleted from the 3\u2032 end of ORF4b instead of the large deletion. Despite this evidence of amino acid deletions, these changes were not predicted to affect the function of ORF4b, suggesting similar activity to those in other East African MERS-CoV isolates (Kiambi et al., 2018). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis performed using the spike (S) protein, an important protein involved in viral infection and neutralization, also showed similar clustering between isolates, suggesting that genomic attributes of East African MERS-CoV are present in the S protein (Figure 2B).",

S1 binds to its receptor, whereas S2 is responsible for fusion activity (Sturman et al., 1985; Spaan et al., 1988; Kubo et al., 1993). The S protein also harbors most of the neutralizing antibody epitopes and is associated with pathogenicity (Spaan et al., 1988; Takase-Yoden et al., 1991; Kubo et al., 1993; Holmes and Compton, 1995). Variations in the S protein are therefore thought to directly influence important biological characteristics of the virus, such as pathogenicity and antigenicity. To evaluate the roles of these proteins in the Amibara isolates, recombinant MERS-CoVs were generated using a BAC vector system (Terada et al., 2017; Matsuyama et al., 2018) in which the S protein sequence of the EMC isolate was replaced with those of the Amibara isolates and designated as 118S and 126S (Figure 3A). The replication rates of the Amibara S recombinants were 2 logs lower than that of EMC in Vero cells until 3 days post-infection (Figure 3B). By contrast, TMPRSS2 was shown to enhance viral entry and replication of MERS-CoV (Gierer et al., 2013; Shirato et al., 2013), although the peak titers of the recombinants in Vero/TMPRSS2 cells were similar, with a slight delay in replication in the Amibara S recombinants at 1-day post-infection (Figure 3C).",

In addition, camels exported from Ethiopia to the Middle East generally do not return to Ethiopia (Faye, 2014; Eshetu and Abraham, 2016), and it is unlikely that camels carrying Middle Eastern MERS-CoV would affect the serology in Ethiopia. In addition, though yearly changes of Ethiopian MERS-CoV are unknown due to the shortage of genomic sequence database, in the neighboring country Kenya, the amino acid sequences of S1 region are identical among isolates in 2017 to 2018 (GenBank accession nos. MK357908-9 and MH734114-5, data not shown). This raises the possibility of antigenical stability in same geographical area in East Africa. Therefore, we believe that there was little divergence between sera collected in 2013 and those collected in 2017 in Ethiopia, and that the immune response to MERS-CoV in dromedaries in Afar is likely more closely related to the Amibara isolates than the EMC isolates. Thus, we suspected that there may be differences in antigenicity between the EMC and Amibara S proteins. Therefore, we performed a second neutralizing assay in mice using sera derived from mice inoculated with the EMC isolate (Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Figure 6). Sera from five mice were used for evaluation. In contrast to our initial suspicions, the neutralization assay showed similar kinetics to those presented in Figure 4, i.e., the Amibara S recombinant strains were effectively neutralized using lower antibody concentrations than those used in the EMC S recombinant, even in EMC-immunized mouse sera. Thus, although the S protein sequence of 2017\u2019 Amibara isolates might be different from that in 2013, when the camel sera had collected, regardless of it, the neutralizing profile among Amibara and EMC S proteins was clearly different. These results suggested that the antigenicities of EMC and Amibara S proteins are not different, but the Amibara S protein was more readily neutralized by MERS-CoV-antibodies than was the EMC S protein.",

The number of differing amino acid between the EMC and Amibara S proteins was 10 for 118S and 11 for 126S (Supplementary Figure S2), with most differences present in the S1 region. Therefore, recombinant virus strains expressing the chimeric S protein were generated by interchanging the S1 and S2 regions in EMC and Amibara S (118) proteins. Replacements were performed at the first furin site, which marks the junction between the S1 and S2 regions, yielding recombinants harboring chimeric S proteins (designated EMC/118 and 118/EMC). Neutralization assays were then performed using dromedary sera as described above (Figure 7). The results showed that the neutralizing kinetics depended primarily on the S1 region. The neutralization titers for EMC and EMC/118S were significantly lower than those for 118 EMC and 118 S. These observations indicated that the difference in neutralization profiles between the EMC and Amibara S proteins was dependent on the S1 region.",

The S protein of Ethiopian MERS-CoV isolates was shown to confer slow viral replication in cells and was more easily neutralized in response to antibodies, relative to the EMC isolate. These findings suggest that differences in viral replication, and the neutralizing properties of EMC and Ethiopian MERS-CoV isolates may explain the marked discrepancy in human cases between regions. The results of this and other studies showed the Ethiopian dromedaries were highly infected with MERS-CoV (Miguel et al., 2017). The current state of human MERS-CoV infections in Ethiopia is unclear due to a lack of adequate surveillance studies, but the reported seropositive rate in humans in the neighboring country Kenya is 0.18%, providing a baseline for assessing viral exposure (Liljander et al., 2016).",

Dromedaries are commonly exported from Ethiopia to the Middle East for meat, milk production, and other purposes and are consumed at the final destination (Faye, 2014; Eshetu and Abraham, 2016). Although some exported dromedaries may harbor Ethiopian MERS-CoV variants, these Ethiopian strains may be likely to be overtaken by Middle Eastern strains similar to the EMC strain due to variations that confer lower replication rates and higher immune clearance rates. The unidirectional nature of dromedary trade and the nature of region-specific MERS-CoV variants likely may explain why human MERS-CoV cases have remained restricted to the Middle East.",

            "text": "One of the most important findings of this study was that the virological differences between Ethiopian and EMC isolates were based on the S protein. The coronaviral S protein is strongly associated with viral pathogenicity (Spaan et al., 1988). Following infection, the viral S protein is cleaved by host-derived proteases into two subunits: S1, which is responsible for receptor binding and neutralization, and S2, which is responsible for fusion activity (Sturman et al., 1985; Spaan et al., 1988; Kubo et al., 1993). The numbers of amino acid differences between the EMC and Amibara S proteins are 10 for 118S and 11 for 126S (Supplementary Figure S2), with most differences localized to the S1 region. The receptor binding domain (RBD) is also found in the S1 region between amino acids 367 and 606 (Chen et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). The results presented here show that Amibara S is more susceptible to antibody neutralization than the EMC S protein. The majority of neutralizing antibodies work by binding to the RBD, serving as a competitive inhibitor of the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; Li et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018), or by inducing conformational changes in the S protein (Zhang et al., 2018). The amino acid differences in the RBD of EMC and Amibara S proteins are S390F, A597V, and P515L (only in 126S). Although these residues are not in direct contact with DPP4 (Wang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018), substitutions in these regions may affect antibody binding affinity.",

For CoVs, the S protein is thought to be cleaved into S1 and S2 at around the first furin site (Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012), although some CoVs lack furin cleavage sites. There are three amino acid differences in the S2 regions of the EMC and Amibara S proteins. The A851E substitution occurs upstream of the second furin site, the S2\u2032 site, which is located immediately upstream of a putative fusion peptide of coronaviral spike protein (Madu et al., 2009). Cleavage at this position leads to important conformational changes (Park et al., 2016; Matsuyama et al., 2018). Therefore, this mutation may result in differences in viral entry between EMC and Amibara S recombinants. However, we reported previously that although the protease sensitivity of the human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E S protein was different between a cell-adapted laboratory strain and clinical isolates, this difference was no longer apparent after replacing two amino acids in the S2 region (Shirato et al., 2017). Similarly, differences in macrophage infectivity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV, nonsusceptible) and feline infectious peritoneal virus (FIPV, susceptible) disappeared after introducing five amino acid substitutions (Shirato et al., 2018a). Taken together, a single mutation or a combination of mutations found in the S protein suggest clear differences associated with viral infectivity and other virulence traits. More work remains to be done to elucidate the underlying causes of S protein-derived pathogenicity in the Amibara isolate using a recombinant MERS-CoV strain.",

Although West African MERS-CoVs lacks the ORF4b gene, the absence of this gene resulted in higher type I and III interferon responses in Calu-3 cells, suggesting its potential contribution to lower viral replication (Chu et al., 2018). Differences in the public health infrastructure between Middle Eastern and African countries have often been cited as the main cause of regional deviation in MERS cases. However, in addition to the report by Chu et al. (2018), this study provided evidence of regional differences in MERS-CoVs, in which Ethiopian MERS-CoV strains exhibited lower replication rates and greater susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies than the EMC isolate. In addition, a previous genetic analysis of Middle Eastern isolates revealed an amino acid mutation at position 1,020 of the S protein, with strong selection for this variant in human MERS cases since its first appearance in 2012 (Cotten et al., 2014). This suggests a pathogenic transition of MERS-CoV during human outbreaks in the Middle East. Taken together, these observations suggest that not only the differences in public health infrastructure but also virological differences between MERS-CoV may affect regional differences in MERS cases.",
