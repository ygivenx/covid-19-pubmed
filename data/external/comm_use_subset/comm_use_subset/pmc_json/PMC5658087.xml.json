            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common cause of hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection (LTRI) in children under five years of age, worldwide. Severe RSV disease occurs at the extremes of age. RSV is the leading cause of death due to LTRI in children under six months of age [1]. Among elderly patients, RSV infection is also a major cause of hospitalizations and associated deaths in the USA [2\u20134]. Thus, the development of an effective RSV vaccine is of substantial importance. Live vaccines such as the smallpox vaccine pioneered by Jenner [5] provide immunity, but may have safety risks; inactivated vaccines are generally safer, but when a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine adjuvanted with alum was evaluated in healthy infants and young children in the 1960\u2019s [6, 7] 80% of vaccinees who were infected required hospitalization compared to 5% of the control group.",

            "text": "Considerable effort has been directed towards developing subunit -based RSV vaccines designed to elicit potently neutralizing antibodies targeting specific epitopes. RSV F and G surface proteins as well as chimeric F/G variants when used as immunogens, resulted in robust albeit poorly neutralizing antibodies [8, 9]. These subunit vaccine approaches have been further explored in both purified protein [10\u201313] and vector-based formats [14, 15]. Vaccine approaches based on soluble proteins are generally poorly immunogenic and usually require adjuvants to augment their immunogenicity. A number of synthetic and natural compounds have been identified to have adjuvant activity, however, only a few including alum, squalene oil-in-water (MF59), and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) have achieved widespread human use. Most adjuvants either activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs)) in the innate immune system or improve the delivery of antigens to the immune system. The most common adjuvant, alum, comprised of aluminum salts, has been used in humans since 1932, is approved for human use by the FDA, and is a component of numerous licensed vaccines such as Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, and hepatitis B vaccines. MPLA with Alum is used for the hepatitis B vaccine, Fendrix, and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, Cervarix, and has extensive human safety data in this context. Oil-in-water formulations such as MF59 [16] are components of FLUAD (a new seasonal flu vaccine for the elderly) MPLA is also a component of Pollinex Quattro, a vaccine used for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis [17]. Combinations of MF59 with polyanionic carbomers [16, 18] as well as Adjuplex (a coformulation of carbomer with lecithin [19]) are potent and well-tolerated adjuvants when administered with subunit vaccines. Carbomers have also been evaluated as experimental adjuvants in veterinary vaccines against swine parvovirus [20], circovirus type 2 [21], Staphylococcus aureus in sheep [22], and equine influenza virus [23]. Poly (I:C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA and its derivative Poly (IC:LC) [10, 24] have been reported in a range of animal species from mice to nonhuman primates revealing significant enhancement of immunogenicity and are in cancer immunotherapy clinical trials [25] and are a component of intranasal flu vaccine FluMist [26]. Montanide is a family of oil-based adjuvants used to produce an emulsion with the antigen of interest. It has been used in experimental vaccines in mice, rats, dogs and cats using natural, recombinant and synthetic antigens. Montanide is used worldwide in both bovine and ovine vaccinations against viral, bacterial or parasitic diseases. In humans, Montanide emulsions have been used in experimental human vaccines against HIV, malaria and breast cancer [27, 28]. Each of these adjuvants have unique characteristics and mechanisms, and their impact on the immune response induced by a particular immunogen generally needs to be determined experimentally.",

DS-Cav1 when adjuvanted with TLR3 agonists Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC) induces high neutralizing antibody titers in mice and nonhuman primates, respectively [10]. Herein, we report a comparative adjuvant study with DS-Cav1 formulated with nine different adjuvants (Table 1) in na\u00efve mice. We also studied elderly mice that had been pre-immunized with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Poly (I:C). We further evaluated the impact of Carbopol in mice and calves using a bovine RSV F version of DS-Cav1. The results indicate that adjuvant is required for DS-Cav1 to induce high titer responses, that moderate to high titer responses can be induced by all the adjuvants tested, and that the optimal response to adjuvants appears to be both context-dependent (e.g. whether animals have pre-existing responses) and species-specific (e.g. the addition of Carbopol induced very high responses in mice, but not in calves).",

We explored site-specific immune response with the aid of a) DS-Cav1 probes with KO mutations in antigenic site \u00d8, and b) DS-Cav1 and Post F probes with KO mutations in antigenic site II [12, 40]. We initially measured binding of week 5 sera to DS-Cav1, Post F, DS-Cav1 site \u00d8 KO, DS-Cav1 site II KO and Post F site II KO probes using BioLayer Interferometry. Sera reactivity for five groups corresponding to Poly (I:C), Poly (IC:LC), SAS, SAS + Carbopol and Adjuplex showed the greatest response to DS-Cav1, followed by AddaVax and Alum. Sera corresponding to MPLA, and MPLA plus Alum exhibited the lowest binding response (Fig 2B). Furthermore, sera from all groups exhibited reduced binding to DS-Cav1 site \u00d8 KO (Fig 2B). The pre-fusion specific site \u00d8 KO probe bound significantly less to sera from Poly (I:C), Poly (IC:LC), SAS, SAS + Carbopol, and Adjuplex adjuvant groups relative to DS-Cav1 (p = 0.0006, 0.0040, 0.0043,0.0040 and 0.0019 respectively), demonstrating that these five adjuvants could facilitate a robust response to antigenic site \u00d8. In contrast, no significant difference was observed in sera from the Alum, MPLA, MPLA + Alum and AddaVax groups (Fig 2B), indicating that these adjuvants were unable to enhance the immune response to antigenic site \u00d8. Examining the sera response to antigenic sites as probed by DS-Cav1 site II knockout and Post F site II knockout probes, further demonstrated that the neutralizing antibody response was focused to pre-fusion specific antigenic sites displayed on RSV F.",

Formulations with MPLA, Alum plus MPLA, AddaVax and Adjuplex induced an IgG1 response with no detectable IgG2a response. On the other hand, DS-Cav1 formulated with Alum induced a primarily IgG1 response and DS-Cav1 formulations with SAS, SAS + Carbopol, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC: LC) induced both an IgG1 and IgG2a response. Unadjuvanted DS-Cav1 induced a marginal IgG1 response and no detectable IgG2a response. The IgG subclass response pattern appeared to be determined not only by the properties of the adjuvant but also by the protein adjuvant formulation. The IgG2a and IgG1 subclass responses reflect the respective T helper 1 cell (Th1) and T helper 2 cell (Th2) biased immune response patterns in mice [42]. The slight IgG1 dominant response elicited by unadjuvanted DS-Cav1 is likely due to stimulation of Th2 biased response in mice [41, 43]. Although MPLA is known to augment a Th1 biased response the MPLA and MPLA + Alum adjuvant formulations were not sufficient to influence the IgG response towards a Th1 phenotype nor were Adjuplex and AddaVax sufficient to influence the IgG response towards the expected balanced Th1/Th2 response [19, 44]. As expected, the Alum adjuvant formulations stimulated primarily the expected IgG1 with some IgG2a response for Alum alone. The IgG1 to IgG2a ratio indicated a significantly greater Th2-biased response for DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum, MPLA, Adjuplex (p < 0.001) than for Poly (I:C), Poly (IC:LC), SAS and SAS + Carbopol which gave a balanced IgG1 to IgG2a response (Fig 3A and 3B).",

Reciprocal EC50 neutralization titers had waned during the ~85 week interval period. However, a single boost with DS-Cav1 with Alum formulation increased the neutralization titers to the week five level (p = 0.0313) and titers did not increase after a second immunization at week 93. Interestingly, when DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with SAS + Carbopol was used to boost the elderly mice, neutralization titers increased from the waned response (p = >0.05), but remained lower than the initial response observed in young mice. Thus, in elderly mice that experienced multiple RSV immunizations as young mice, but still had modest levels of serum-neutralizing activity, boosting the response with alum as an adjuvant could effectively achieve above threshold levels of protective immunity.",

Adjuvants may influence the type of immune profile as well as the breadth of neutralizing antibodies [45] or the persistence of the protective response. One of the major goals of vaccination against RSV is to induce immunity in a wide range of age groups from neonates to the elderly. In the elderly population who have experienced repeated RSV infections throughout life, and have some pre-existing immunity, boosting the response to neutralization-sensitive epitopes could achieve threshold levels of protective immunity. This may require formulations of a RSV vaccine with different adjuvants. We undertook a comparative study of adjuvants on a single immunogen RSV F DS-Cav1 in na\u00efve and elderly CB6F1/J mice. In our study with na\u00efve mice significantly higher EC50 neutralization titers were observed in six groups of mice immunized with DS-Cav1: Alum, SAS, SAS + Carbopol, Adjuplex, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC) than for DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with TLR4 agonist MPLA, Alum plus MPLA and AddaVax, whereas unadjuvanted DS-Cav1 titers were below the protective threshold (Fig 1). Alum surprisingly exhibited stronger adjuvant effects on the magnitude of antibody response than MPLA or Alum + MPLA when formulated with DS-Cav1, even though ASO4 (Alum plus MPLA formulation) has a synergistic effect when adjuvanted with HPV virus-like particles [46]. Thus, immunogenicity may be influenced not just by the properties and concentration or dose of the adjuvant [47] but also by the combination of immunogen and adjuvant. It is not known whether there is a specific property of Alum that improves the response or whether TLR4 agonists like MPLA in some way interfere with the responses to RSV F.",

            "text": "IgG2a and IgG1 subclass responses, reflect respective T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 cell (Th2)-biased immune response patterns in mice [42]. Interestingly, SAS, SAS + Carbopol, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC) groups induced a balanced Th1/Th2 IgG response, whereas Alum, MPLA, Alum plus MPLA, Adjuplex and Addavax induced a predominantly Th2-biased IgG1 response. Adjuvant groups with high neutralization titers against RSV exhibited a balanced Th1/Th2 response. High titer neutralizing antibodies have been reported with a balanced Th1/Th2 response when mice were immunized with reconstituted virosomes produced from RSV envelopes containing a lipopeptide adjuvant [48]. In contrast, to the Th2-biased response induced by DS-Cav1 with Adjuplex, a balanced Th1/Th2 response was obtained when mice were immunized with influenza HA protein formulated with Adjuplex [19]. In elderly mice with some pre-existing immunity, boosting the response with Alum as an adjuvant could achieve high levels of protective immunity whereas with SAS + Carbopol as an adjuvant, more than one immunization was necessary to achieve a similar level of neutralization. In contrast, Alum adjuvant with RSV F protein in elderly BALB/c mice also conferred protection (neutralizing anti-RSV F antibody titers) albeit the protection was sub-optimal compared to that seen in young mice [49]. Interestingly, in the Alum group for elderly mice, the IgG1/IgG2a response was determined by the priming immunization of na\u00efve mice as the DS-Cav1-Poly (I:C) prime boost regimen induced a balanced IgG1/IgG2a pattern. Thus, our results indicate that the RSV F vaccine immune response in mice is not just influenced by the properties and concentration or dose of the adjuvant [47] but can be augmented by combinations of antigen and adjuvant and adjuvants that enable a Th1/Th2 \u2013balanced response result in higher RSV neutralizing activity in mice. Overall, our data support the fact that adjuvants play less of a role in determining responses following a boost in pre-immune animals than they do in the inductive event following a primary immunization. While the addition of Carbopol to the oil-in-water adjuvant SAS enhanced the antibody response in mice, the addition of Carbopol to the water-in-oil adjuvant ISA 71 VG did not appear to enhance the antibody response in calves. Overall, our results suggest that the particulars of different adjuvants may be species specific. Furthermore, the role of adjuvants in the context of RSV immunization and the legacy of formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine-enhanced illness should be considered. There are two major immunological patterns associated with the formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccine-enhanced illness. One was poor functional neutralizing antibody (NT) activity despite induction of significant binding antibody. This is thought to contribute to immune complex deposition in small airways that were documented in the children who died from the FI-RSV enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) [50]. The second pattern was a Th2-biased CD4 T cell response associated with eosinophilia and neutrophilic alveolitis [51]. Although it is possible that if sufficient NT activity is induced and the specificity of the response is corrected that controlling the T cell response patterns with adjuvants may make it possible to test protein-based vaccines again in RSV-na\u00efve neonates, it will be a difficult regulatory hurdle. If the dose of a stabilized pre-F antigen is reduced to very low levels to induce a subprotective antibody response, it is possible to simulate the pattern of lung inflammation seen with full doses of less effective vaccines [52]. Therefore, just using the correct conformation of a vaccine antigen and redirecting antibody to neutralization-sensitive sites may not be sufficient, even with Th1-biased adjuvants, to prevent a pathogenic inflammatory response to breakthrough infection. For the pre-F vaccine antigen delivered as protein the ultimate target populations are pregnant women, the elderly, and potentially older children. All these groups will have been primed by natural infection, so the role of adjuvant is primarily to increase the magnitude of the response based on the established precursor T cell and B cell populations. For pregnant women, vaccination should avoid excessive Th1-biased responses for safety concerns related to the pregnancy. If adjuvants are needed to boost antibody responses to protective levels in adults, alum-based formulations may have an acceptable safety and immunological profile for use in pregnancy. In the elderly or older children, the most potent, tolerable adjuvant should be chosen based on results from early phase clinical trials.",
