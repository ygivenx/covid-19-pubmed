Flaviviruses encode a single polyprotein processed by host and viral protease to produce three structural proteins, including capsid (C) protein, precursor membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E) protein, and seven nonstructural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 [5].

E protein domain I (E-DI) is a central \u03b2-barrel structure. E protein domain II (E-DII) is organized into two long finger-like structures and contains the flaviviruses conserved fusion loop. E protein domain III (E-DIII) has an immunoglobulin-like fold and may mediate interactions between the virus and the receptors on the host cell [11]. Studies of the biological characteristics and epitope specificities of mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have elucidated the antigenic structure of flavivirus E proteins [12]\u2013[15]. Serotype-specific mAbs with neutralizing activity against DENV-2 have been found to be located on the lateral ridge of E-DIII and the subcomplex-specific mAbs recognized A-strand of E-DIII [14], [16], [17]. Antibody-mediated neutralization has been found to alter the arrangement of viral surface glycoproteins that prevent cells from viral attachment [16]. Binding of an antibody to the viral surface can interfere with virus internalization or membrane fusion [6].",

However, humoral immune responses to DENV infection are complex [20]\u2013[22], and may exacerbate the disease during heterologous virus infection [18], [19]. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in dengue pathogenesis results from the increase in the efficiency of virus infection in the presence of non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing concentrations of anti-E or anti-prM immunoglobulins [21], [23]. The attachment of antibody-virus complex to such Fc\u03b3 receptor-bearing cells as monocytes and macrophages can lead to an increased virus replication [18], [24], [25].",

Studies of the neutralizing epitopes found the strongest mAbs to be DB32-6 and DB25-2, both DENV-2 serotype-specific antibodies. These two mAbs recognized the A-strand of E-DIII at residues K310 and E311, respectively.

Both 4G2 and 3H5 were used as positive controls (Figure 1). The specificities of the mAbs recognized as the four DENVs were further confirmed by ELISA and Western blotting (Figures 1A\u20131B and Table 1). Based on our Western blot analysis using a nonreducing condition, 14 of the mAbs recognized E protein (53 kDa) (Figure 1B). Three mAbs could not be identified by Western blotting. In order to identify the target proteins of these mAbs, we prepared BHK-21 cells transfected with plasmids expressing DENV-2 C, prM, prM-E, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS2B-3, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 (Figure S2). Results indicated that three mAbs (DB21-6, DB22-4 and DB36-2) recognized E protein (Figure 1C). The identification and characterization of the 17 mAbs are summarized in Table 1.",

Protection assay of neutralizing mAbs was performed with ICR strain 2-day-old suckling mice [41].

Generally, the non-neutralizing antibody normal mouse IgG (NMIgG) treated group showed paralysis, ruffling, and slowing of activity around 6 to 9 days. This was followed by severe sickness leading to anorexia, asthenia and death within 9 to 17 days (Figures 2B and 2C). In contrast, mAbs DB32-6 at a concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml protected 93% of the mice from the lethal challenge of DENV-2 (Figure 2B). mAbs 3H5, DB23-3, DB2-3 and DB25-2 had survival rates of 75%, 76%, 72% and 71%, respectively. DB42-3 and DB13-19 had survival rates of 46% and 28%, respectively (Figure 2B). The neutralizing mAbs showed a significant delay of the onset of paralysis and death relative to the NMIgG. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of the highly protective mAb DB32-6, we administered 100 \u00b5g/ml or 1 \u00b5g/ml to infected suckling mice. The survival rates for DB32-6 at 100 \u00b5g/ml or 1 \u00b5g/ml were 100% and 89%, respectively (Figure 2C).

DB32-6 was the most potent mAb against DENV-2 and showed potential as a therapeutic antibody. To develop humanized mAbs, we sequenced VH and VL segment of the neutralizing mAbs from hybridoma cell lines. The CDRs of DB32-6 were grafted onto human IgG1 backbone to create humanized DB32-6 (hDB32-6) (Figure 5A). The hDB32-6 was expressed in CHO-K1 cells and purified from culture supernatants. Both hDB32-6 and mDB32-6 were able to against DENV-2 (Figure 5B). The hDB32-6 maintained the specificity of murine DB32-6 (mDB32-6). Furthermore, we established stable clones of hDB32-6. After selection, mAbs hDB32-6-30, hDB32-6-48 and hDB32-6-51 were found to have highly binding activity (Figure 5C). Comparing to these mAbs, we found hDB32-6-48 to have the highest production rate in cells. mAb hDB32-6-48 was dose-dependent against DENV-2 and E-DIII (Figure 5D). The affinity was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. The mDB32-6 and hDB32-6-48 bound to E-DIII of DENV-2 with a similar affinity (0.12 nM and 0.18 nM, respectively) (Figure 5E). The results revealed that hDB32-6 maintained the same binding affinity to the E protein as mDB32-6.",

Investigation of neutralizing epitopes on the E proteins may provide the framework for a detailed understanding of both specific mechanisms of the viral infection as well as the identification of the specific DENV domain that attaches to a cellular receptor. Phage display is useful in the identification of B-cell epitopes, including linear [32], [51] and conformational epitopes [29], [45]. However, these epitopes need to further elucidation using other methods. Combining different strategies provided a fast and reliable evidence for identifying epitopes (Figures 3 and 4). To date, few mAbs possess better neutralizing activity than 3H5, which has been shown to bind to residues K305, E383 and P384 at the lateral ridge of E-DIII [17], [20]. DB32-6 had higher neutralizing activity than 3H5. Neutralizing epitope of DB32-6 was mapped on K310 residue in A-strand of E-DIII (Figure 4). Neutralizing epitope of another mAb DB25-2 was mapped on E311 residue in A-strand of E-DIII, too (Figure 4). These serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes located in the A-strand of E-DIII induced stronger neutralizing activity than those located on the lateral ridge of E-DIII. We aligned different DENV-2 genotypes and found that the K310 and E311 were frequently observed in DENV-2 (Figure S5). The K310 may be important to DENV-2. Thus by binding DB32-6 to K310, it lead to dramatic neutralized DENV-2. To determine whether DB32-6 can neutralize diverse genotypes of DENV-2 is a critical step in evaluating the potential of therapeutic development in the future.",

Our mAb DB32-6 is a serotype-specific neutralizing mAb that recognized residue K310 but not residues K305 or K307. Although K310 is considered as a subcomplex-specific epitope, DB32-6 is a serotype-specific mAb. There may be other regions that affect the binding of DB32-6 to DENV-2. We found that by mutating residue I312, DB32-6's binding activity was reduced by 50% (data not shown). Residue I312 may be a minor epitope of DB32-6. Moreover, 1A1D-2 is a temperature dependent mAb due to its needs for dynamic motion on the virion surface to neutralize virus [16]. Different from 1A1D-2, DB32-6 is temperature independent. When DB32-6 was incubated with DENV at 4\u00b0C, it still exhibited significant neutralizing activity (Figures 2 and 6). As expected, when incubating the DENV and DB32-6 at 37\u00b0C, DB32-6 showed better efficacy than it did at 4\u00b0C (data not shown). The residue K310 on the surface of DENV-2 may be accessible to DB32-6 binding. Additionally, DB32-6 had high binding affinity (0.12\u20130.18 nM) to DENV-2. Based on the above finding, the residue K310 induce serotype-specific mAbs and is crucial in the neutralization of virus infectivity.",

However, there are fewer antibody concentrations capable of recognizing E-DIII than there are that recognize E-DI-II in dengue patients [20], [39]. Wahala et al. studied the human immune sera of DENV infection and found the E-DIII binding antibodies to play a minor role in DENV neutralization, similar to West Nile virus-infected human [52], [53]. The mAbs that bind to E-DIII expresses potent neutralizing activity, but only a few of them exist in serum of the patients infected with DENV or WNV. Combining the information from both mice and human mAbs studies of DENV infection is critical to understanding the complex mechanism behind the humoral immunity following natural DENV infection. According to one previous study, the immunoglobulin populations recognizing residues K310, E311 and P364 in dengue fever patients were much larger in IgM than in IgG [20]. The strong neutralizing IgG made up a small proportion of the antibody in dengue patients. de Alwis et al. has conducted an in-depth analysis of the human mAbs derived from memory B-cells of patients infected with primary DENV infections [54]. After the epitope mapping of anti-DENV-2 human mAbs, the strong neutralizing mAb 10.16 was mapped to K305, K310 and E311 in the A-strand. Together, the finding above suggest that the highly protective epitopes K310 and E311 in mouse play a role in humans as well.",

Some studies have identified highly neutralizing and protective antibodies against JEV and DENV located in E-DI [55], [56] Currently, we are in the process of identifying the neutralizing epitopes of DB2-3 and DB23-3. mAbs that broadly cross-react with other flaviviruses are in E-DII near the fusion loop, which is immunodominant antigenic [20], [34], [42]. Binding an antibody to DENV can change the rearrangement of the E protein, which may neutralize or enhance viral infection [16], [57]. The high or no neutralizing activity of our mAbs can be used help identify neutralizing or immunopathogenic epitopes in the E protein. Studies that explore the mAbs mediated neutralization mechanism and mAbs dependent enhancement are currently underway.",

Our findings suggested that mAb DB32-6 might effectively block virus entry. However, disease manifestation of suckling mice is not relevant to dengue disease in humans since DENV infections in humans rarely involve the nervous system [58]. The Stat1-deficient mice are genetically mutated and not immunocompetent, hence they are not representative of the wild types' immune response to DENV. However, their survival rates might reflect the therapeutic potential of these mAbs. The results from these mouse models showed that the therapeutic potential of this newly generated mAb DB32-6 is worth further investigation.",

Through testing in different mouse models, we have successfully generated a mAb hDB32-6 variant with high therapeutic potential against diverse DENV-2 strains without inducing ADE. Such an antibody-based therapy may help control severe dengue in the future.",
