This in addition to recent metagenomic studies [2,3,4] suggests that only the smallest tip of the RNA virosphere has been identified [5]. With the exception of viroids [6], RNA viruses possess the highest mutation rate of all known species, ranging from 10\u22124\u201310\u22126 mutations per round of genome replication [7,8,9]. This is several orders of magnitude higher than DNA viruses [8] and thousands to tens-of-thousands of times higher than the mutation rates exhibited by bacteria and eukaryotes [10,11]. While the high mutation rate of RNA viruses generates many deleterious mutations, the abundance of RNA viruses suggests that the benefits of a high mutation rate may outweigh the risks. Therefore, it is important to understand what drives this evolutionary strategy and why it is so successful.",

The cloud of virus sequence diversity produced during RNA virus replication is commonly termed a quasispecies, defined as a collection of closely related virus variants, which are hypothesized to cooperate together to produce the overall virus phenotype [12,13]. One consequence of the high mutation rate associated with RNA viruses is that most mutations act as deleterious or neutral depending on the effects on RNA secondary structure or protein sequence. However, the large population sizes produced during the rapid population growth of RNA viruses are believed to result in an overall effective strategy for swift adaptation to changeable environments [14].",

The virus consensus sequence forms the foundation of the fitness landscape, allowing the virus population to explore this landscape through genetic drift with the prospect of finding and climbing new fitness peaks [15]. This landscape is not fixed but changes throughout the viral lifecycle, with the magnitude, location, and frequency of the peaks and valleys moving through both time and space [13,16]. Due to the high error rates produced during RNA virus replication, it is hypothesized that the best strategy for RNA virus survival is to produce a sequence foundation composed of low rolling hills, termed survival of the flattest [17,18]. Thus, mutations away from the consensus sequence should not have large, detrimental effects as the sequence space is explored, but still allow for the virus to identify fitness peaks to aid in survival during an unstable environment. However, survival is not guaranteed, and the mechanisms that allow for the ubiquity of RNA viruses can also be used against them.",

This error threshold is difficult to define, and likely dependent upon the environment, making the exact definition even more difficult, if not impossible [16]. Pushing virus populations over this error threshold has been examined empirically by exposing RNA viruses to various mutagens, most commonly with Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog that is able to pair with cytosine or uracil. As the concentration of a nucleoside analog is increased, so does the virus mutation frequency, until finally the population succumbs to the pressure and becomes extinct [19,20,21,22]. Recently, coxsackievirus B3 and influenza virus mutants were engineered to be 1 mutation away from a stop codon for each leucine or arginine codon. These mutants replicated identically compared to the unaltered viruses in vitro. However, when exposed to nucleoside analog treatment, these viruses were very sensitive, with sharp decreases in virus titer, demonstrating how close RNA viruses are to the edge of a bearable mutation burden [23].",

Additionally, questions arise that are difficult to answer. For example, is a virus a fidelity mutant if it is not high or low-fidelity for all mutation types? For half of the mutation types? As long as the overall balance is consistently higher or lower than the control virus? For example, a Ribavirin resistant foot-and-mouth disease virus variant was identified that lowered the overall virus mutation frequency, but only in the presence of Ribavirin [26]. While there was no difference in the overall mutation frequency in the absence of Ribavirin, the types of mutations produced were significantly different.

However, this information is liable to be important if a vaccine phenotype is not stable or when asking basic science questions. Unfortunately, the frequency of different mutations (e.g., transversion vs. transition mutations) is not available for most fidelity mutants, and the majority of those mutants for which this is available either find an imbalance in different types of mutation [27,28,29] or do not provide enough information to determine this [30,31]. Fortunately, this should be relatively easy to address in future fidelity work. Currently, most researchers have used the landmark poliovirus (PV) fidelity mutant studies as a benchmark to determine if they have discovered a virus fidelity mutant of their own.",

During this passaging, multiple synonymous transition mutations appeared in the RdRp, as well as one nonsynonymous mutation, G64S. When the G64S mutation was inserted into the PV genome, this mutant was found to grow as well as the wild type (wt) virus in vitro. It was also resistant to multiple nucleoside analogs, and was much slower to revert a sequence necessary for PV guanidine hydrochloride resistance, all suggestive of a high-fidelity virus. Although the mutant grew well in vitro, G64S PV was slightly, but consistently outcompeted by the wt virus when passaged together [32]. Later, it was reported that this mutant was attenuated in vivo using poliovirus receptor (PVR) transgenic mice, as G64S PV was able to grow well in the muscle when injected intramuscularly (IM), but severely restricted in its ability to disseminate into the brain [33]. This was not caused by an inability to grow in these tissues, however, as mice infected intracranially (IC) were completely susceptible to infection by G64S or wt virus.",

The G64S mutant acted very similarly in the hands of a different lab, with no alteration of growth kinetics in vitro, as well as reduced lethality in vivo and restricted tissue tropism, with G64S virus unable to infect the central nervous system when introduced by the IM route. Confirmation of high-fidelity genome replication was performed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of passage 3 virus stock followed by high throughput TOPO cloning and sequencing of a fragment of the virus genome. This resulted in the G64S virus population producing a 5.6-fold lower mutation frequency than the wt virus. Most intriguingly, artificial expansion of the G64S virus quasispecies caused this virus to increase in lethality while still maintaining the G64S mutation. However, when virus isolated from these mice was used to infect naive PVR mice, the G64S mutant was attenuated once again. This experiment provided very strong evidence for the quasispecies theory of RNA virus evolution by demonstrating that it was the diversity in the population that caused severe virulence in vivo, not any single mutation.",

            "text": "In the years since the identification of high-fidelity PV, a large number of fidelity variants have been identified from a diverse group of RNA virus families, including Picornaviridae [24,25,27,28,33,34,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43], Togaviridae [44,45,46,47], Flaviviridae [29,48], Caliciviridae [49], Arteriviridae [50], Orthomyxoviridae [31,51], and Coronaviridae [52,53]. The first fidelity mutants were identified similarly to the high-fidelity PV mutant by passaging virus multiple times in the presence of a nucleoside analog, usually Ribavirin. Over the course of passaging, the initial drop in virus titer caused by the nucleoside analog treatment would rise as the virus adapted to the conditions. When this occurred, the full virus genome or RdRp would be sequenced until promising mutations appeared. Sequencing usually revealed that many mutations had occurred, and these would be inserted individually or as a collection into the original virus using reverse genetic techniques and tested for fidelity perturbations. This is a rather laborious process with no guarantee of success, so most fidelity mutants have been identified by rationally targeting conserved residues that were previously implicated as fidelity regulators. Using these different techniques, over 50 fidelity mutants have been identified and characterized. Although the virus families are diverse, fidelity mutants share many common characteristics.",

            "text": "Fidelity mutants generally do not exhibit attenuation during 1-step growth curves, which are typically performed using HeLa or BHK cells. The only clear exceptions to this are arbovirus low-fidelity mutants [29,46], which exhibit significant attenuation in mosquito cells but not vertebrate cells, and the PV fidelity mutants [27,33], which were attenuated in primary cells but not HeLa cells (although recent work has demonstrated a growth defect for PV G64S [54]). Further work is needed to determine if other fidelity mutants are also attenuated in primary cells. Additionally, as replication kinetics assays may not be sensitive to small differences between viruses (e.g. due to slight differences in timing the beginning of the virus infection, collection times, and pipetting errors, it is difficult to determine if 2\u20133-fold differences in titer are accurate between different viruses), a biochemical assay can be used to determine the exact rate of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) addition (further detailed in \u201cmolecular and structural determinants underlying fidelity\u201d). In brief, high-fidelity mutants incorporate NTPs at a slower rate, but more accurately [29,37,42,55], while low-fidelity mutants incorporate NTPs at a faster rate, but with more mistakes [24,25,29,42]. These differences are sometimes severe enough to change the specific infectivity of a virus (i.e., the ratio of virus RNA to plaque forming units (PFU)) [25,29,36,46,52,53] or relative fitness [27,31,32,34,41,43,44,53], but not always.",

            "text": "To quantitatively calculate fidelity changes, virus RNA is usually isolated from virus stock or low passage virus, ranging from 1 to 5 passages. Most groups have measured mutation frequency as in the early PV studies, using RT-PCR followed by TOPO cloning and Sanger sequencing of the clones to screen for variants. Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis has improved dramatically since these first studies, so newer publications also include data showing the amount of minority variant diversity generated across the entire virus genome. However, due to differences in NGS pipelines and diversity calculations, as well as differences in the number of virus passages, it is difficult to compare mutation frequencies from different papers. This is further complicated by the use of virus stocks grown in different cell types, as well as different passaging conditions, making it difficult to tease apart mutations promoted by selection versus inherent differences in the production of mutations. However, most fidelity mutants appear to produce \u00b11.5\u20132-fold change in diversity compared to wt virus (Figure 2). Although these differences in diversity appear small, these alterations have been shown in multiple viruses to translate to significant attenuation in vivo [24,25,27,33,35,37,39,41,42,43,44,46,47,50,51]. However, there is some debate as to the reasons for this observed attenuation [54].",

It is currently not well understood why certain organs fail to become infected with fidelity variants, especially when different routes of inoculation are used, but this is likely due to increased virus sensitivity to host bottlenecks. Interferon (IFN) may also be a factor in this attenuation, but this was only observed for a high-fidelity/low-recombination PV mutant [56]. Alternatively, low fidelity mutants are likely attenuated in vivo due to an over abundance of deleterious mutants. Additionally, arbovirus fidelity variants are usually more attenuated in the mosquito vector than the vertebrate host, with lower virus titers or even almost complete restriction [29,44,46]. This pressure can be intense enough to select for complete reversion of the fidelity altering mutation, as observed for the low-fidelity chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and sindbis virus (SINV) mutants [46], suggesting that optimal virus diversity is especially important in the invertebrate vector.",

Coronaviruses are members of the Coronaviridae family, some of which have evolved uniquely large RNA genomes (i.e., >20 kb). The ability of these large RNA viruses to persist is credited to the ExoN gene, which is a proofreading exoribonuclease [57]. When this proofreading function is ablated, RdRp fidelity drops by approximately 20-fold [52,58]. Interestingly, when a mouse hepatitis virus ExoN mutant was passaged hundreds of times, fidelity slowly increased, likely due to compensatory mutations that occurred in ExoN, as well as the RdRp, but reversion of the original ExoN mutations never occurred [53].",

The G64S mutation causes a misalignment of this hydrogen bond, which causes the misalignment to be even more severe when an incorrect NTP binds, thus increasing RdRp fidelity [62]. Alternatively, low-fidelity H273R PV decreases fidelity by favoring an open state of the RdRp, which decreases the duration of this fidelity checkpoint, thus increasing the likelihood of NTP misincorporation [63].",

The wt PV quickly mutated this miRNA sequence and began a productive infection, while the G64S variant necessitated an additional 48 h before it was also able to overcome this selection pressure. Interestingly, all of the G64S isolates contained the same deletion to remove the let-7 miRNA, while the wt virus isolates reverted using different mutations and deletions. This suggests that although high-fidelity viruses are able to revert that these reversions are predictable and can thus be anticipated and prepared for. When tested as a vaccine, the G64S mutant was shed approximately 100-fold less in feces than the wt virus.

While it is unknown whether H273R is prone to reversion, this mutant was shown to be sensitive to bottlenecks, undergoing population extinction at a 10-fold higher PFU than the wt virus.

In fact, recent research has clearly demonstrated that the high fidelity G64S PV mutant has a significant growth defect [54].",

As fidelity mutants commonly display lower titers and tissue restriction in vivo [25,34,35,39,44,46,50,70], perhaps the lower titers produced by fidelity mutants act as a bottleneck, producing a virus population without the correct mutant spectrum to infect the same number of tissues as wt virus. Additionally, a drop in the virus titer due to slightly slower replication kinetics likely makes the infection easier for the host to control, which could be a confounding factor in the quasispecies hypothesis of attenuation commonly believed to be responsible for the in vivo attenuation observed for fidelity mutants. This begs the question of whether replication fidelity and kinetics can ever truly be separated.",

For example, measuring the incorporation of 1\u20132 nt, as is common in sym/sub replication kinetics experiments, is not an accurate depiction of virus replication, which naturally requires the RdRp to replicate not one, but thousands of nucleotide bases. A new technique, known as magnetic tweezers, addresses this by attaching a coverslip to one strand of an approximately 3 kb double-stranded RNA molecule and a magnetic bead to the other [71,72]. As the RdRp replicates the RNA, this releases the beaded RNA strand from the anchored RNA strand, allowing the magnetic bead to migrate upwards towards a magnet.

This suggests that low-fidelity polymerases are prone to stuttering when replicating, which may impact other polymerase-associated events, such as recombination.

Interestingly, when low-fidelity H273R PV was examined using this technique, it was found to cause a reduced number of infections compared to wt virus, as well as a delay in replication initiation [73]. However, H273R was able to replicate quickly enough to reach peak titer at the same time at wt PV. This experiment confirmed what had been measured using the sym/sub system [27], suggesting that some of the measurements that once required cell-free systems to assay can now be performed in cells. This also improves upon the more standard biochemical and growth curve kinetics assays by allowing for the measurement of thousands of infections at the same time in replicate, instead of only examining a composite.

While G64R, G64T, and S264L RdRp mutations were all able to increase HEV71 fidelity in vitro [38], only S264L caused attenuation in vivo when using 5-day-old BALB/c mice, which have an intact IFN response [70]. However, when these mutants were later examined in a slightly different virus backbone that was not murine-adapted, G64R was approximately 3-fold less virulent than S264L when using 10-day-old AG129 mice (IFN-receptor deficient), which itself was 37-fold less virulent than the control virus [39]. This is odd, because these results suggest that small changes to the HEV71 backbone can cause dramatic changes in virulence. However, if the highly conserved PV G64 residue is able to increase fidelity in a distantly related enterovirus such as HEV71, this is not likely to be the cause of differences in virulence. Alternatively, changing the mouse model may have resulted in decreased G64R virulence in AG129 mice. However, as PV G64S [33,34] and other fidelity mutants [25,27,37,40,41,42,43,44,46,50,51] are attenuated in mice with intact IFN, it would therefore be predicted that the HEV71 G64R mutant would also be attenuated in the BALB/c model. Thus, there is no clear explanation for why the HEV71 G64R mutant would behave so differently in the hands of different labs.",

The first study to examine PV G64S in vivo infected cohorts of 10-week-old PVR mice IM with 5 \u00d7 106 PFU of G64S or wt PV [33]. Of the 25 mice per cohort, approximately 10 G64S PV mice exhibited no symptoms over the course of infection, while only 5 of the mice infected with wt PV exhibited no symptoms. While it was stated that fewer deaths were recorded for G64S infected mice, this data was not shown. Similar results to this initial paper were recently published by Fitzsimmons et al. [54], which found that only 10% of 6\u20138-week-old PVR mice infected IM with 106 PFU G64S PV were able to survive infection, although time to death was delayed for these mice. Fitzsimmons et al. additionally reported IM median lethal dose (LD50) values of 1.47 \u00d7 105 PFU for wt PV and 6.81 \u00d7 105 PFU for G64S, a 4.6-fold difference. In contrast to these papers, Vignuzzi et al. [34] found that 100% of 8-week-old PVR mice infected IM with 107 PFU of G64S were able to survive infection, suggesting that this G64S virus stock was more attenuated than the stocks used during these other in vivo virulence studies [33]. Vignuzzi et al. also used this experiment to calculate LD50 values, which were 1.2 \u00d7 106 PFU for wt PV and 3.9 \u00d7 108 PFU for G64S, a 325-fold difference, which were the same LD50 values published in a later paper also by the Vignuzzi lab [35].",

However, a recent dissertation [76] reported complete hind limb paralysis in all mice (a common proxy for lethal infection) when 4\u20136-week-old PVR mice were infected IM with 107 PFU of G64S. These mice also showed no difference in the LD50 values for the G64S mutant versus the wt PV. Intriguingly, for this group, G64S was only more attenuated than wt PV when 5-week-old mice were infected IP. This finding was further reinforced by Xiao et al., which also found that 5-week-old PVR mice infected IM with 107 PFU of the G64S mutant succumbed to infection at identical rates as the wt virus [30]. Additionally, there was no difference in the LD50 values. Xiao et al. suggested that this difference may be due to age, as the wt PV LD50 for 8-week old mice in this study was 107 PFU versus 5 \u00d7 105 PFU for 5-week-old mice. However, it is unknown how this translates to high-fidelity G64S PV, as this was not shown, and does not explain why the LD50 values would be so similar for wt PV and G64S. Again, as seen for HEV71 and VEEV, fairly large differences in phenotypes were observed when in vivo experiments were repeated.",

This is concerning, as one of the best pieces of evidence for the theory of virus quasispecies is the original high-fidelity PV study by Vignuzzi et al., which demonstrated that it was the overall diversity of the quasispecies that caused virulence, not any one mutation [34]. Perhaps it is not surprising that in vivo attenuation is inconsistent, as it is hypothesized that high fidelity viruses are less likely, not entirely unable, to produce the mutants necessary for different tasks (e.g., IFN evasion, host switching). This is supported by recent studies that have correlated specific minority variant mutations to increases in virus fitness [77,78]. Additionally, while low-fidelity viruses are hypothesized to overproduce deleterious, and potentially interfering, mutants [79], perhaps some stocks harbor more interfering mutants than others, while others may generate more high fitness mutations due to random chance, leading to differences in attenuation. Future research examining this is greatly needed.",

Additionally, as suggested by Xiao et al., the age of the mouse could explain the severe changes in attenuation, although this may be specific to PV G64S. If so, this is of large concern for vaccine development, as this suggests that, at best, only certain human populations would benefit from the increased vaccine attenuation granted by fidelity mutant vaccines, or at worst, that there would be no discernable difference between vaccines with or without altered fidelity. This needs to be examined closely to determine exactly what is causing these changes in virulence and if these mechanisms are conserved between different fidelity mutants. At a minimum, this suggests that separate LD50s should be performed for each altered fidelity mutant stock to ensure consistent attenuation.",

For example, the mutation frequency of high-fidelity CHIKV C483Y was initially determined to be approximately 1.4-fold higher than wt virus [44]. Five independent virus stocks for each virus were used to determine these mutation frequencies, and, interestingly, there was large overlap of the mutation frequency error bars between the wt and high-fidelity mutant viruses. Later publications that used C483Y as a control found no difference in the mutation frequencies generated by C483Y or wt CHIKV [45,46]. Importantly, the mutation frequency per 104 bases was slightly higher for wt CHIKV in the initial study compared to more recent papers (5.1 versus 4.4 and 4.4), as well as slightly lower for C483Y (3.6 versus 4.1 and 4.2), suggesting that slight fluctuations in both the wt and RdRp mutant stock mutation frequencies can reduce or entirely ablate significant differences in replication fidelity. Alternatively, this change in the CHIKV C483Y mutation frequency is perhaps explained by an nsP2 mutation, G641D, which was found during the initial high-fidelity CHIKV identification [44] and later shown to also increase CHIKV fidelity [45]. It would be interesting to determine the occurrence of this nsP2 mutation in different CHIKV C483Y stocks, and whether the appearance of this mutation in the minority variant population is correlated with decreased virus sequence diversity. Importantly, while the flux in this CHIKV mutant\u2019s replication fidelity is likely one of the more egregious examples, some degree of mutation frequency flexibility is probably to be expected due to differences in mutation frequency measurements, random chance, and other unknown variables (Figure 4).",

Since these initial reports there have been an explosion of fidelity mutants, which have been used in numerous studies to demonstrate that RNA viruses exist in a narrow range of mutational fidelity, and that any perturbation of this diversity results in attenuation in vivo. However, it is becoming clearer that the phenotypes of these mutants are not always stable, and that there are some caveats to the production of fidelity variants that need to be explored more widely.",

If the outcome of virus recovery is variable and leads to major shifts in the observed phenotype for a fidelity mutant, despite the same consensus level mutations being present, this creates a significant barrier for developing either a controlled experiment, or, in the case of vaccines, a controlled manufacturing process. Although using fidelity mutants translationally as vaccines held such promise during the initial high-fidelity PV studies, more recent evidence suggests that this method of virus attenuation is only workable if attenuated viruses are used as the backbones for these mutants, such as in the VEEV TC-83 study [47]. There is some historical evidence for this, as the vaccine for yellow fever, 17D, is believed to be a safe and effective vaccine based upon multiple attenuating mutations as well as a high fidelity polymerase [81,82]. For vaccines, at a minimum, correlates of attenuation need to be developed by generating many pools of virus stock, establishing a minimum threshold of attenuation (e.g., a significantly lower LD50 in a mouse model), and sequencing these stocks to determine sequences associated with attenuation, virulence, and immunogenicity. It would also be important to passage these stocks to guarantee stability of the vaccine genotype and phenotype to help reduce adverse events following vaccination. Other experiments with altered fidelity mutations should also include replicates from different viral stocks. Without this, it will be impossible to determine the consistency of the fidelity variant.",
