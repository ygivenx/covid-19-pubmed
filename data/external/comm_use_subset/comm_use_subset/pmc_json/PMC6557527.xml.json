However, at national and sub-national levels, uncertainty arises frequently for epidemic pathogens such as seasonal influenza, dengue, RSV and rotavirus; causing problems both for health planners and at-risk individuals who may consider changing their behavior to mitigate their risk during peak periods.",

Because we require an absolute number of cases per week, the CDC ILINet data is converted from percent ILI cases per patient to ILI cases. We estimate the absolute number of weekly ILI cases by dividing the weighted percent of ILI cases in the CDC data by 100 and multiplying it by the total weekly number of patients. We assume two outpatient visits per person per year so that the total weekly number of patients is estimated as: (total regional population)x(2 outpatient visits per person per year)x(1 year/52 weeks).",

The 2011 NAMCS [18] and NHAMCS surveys [19] estimated ambulatory visit rates of 3.32 visits per capita per year for physician\u2019s offices, 0.43 for hospital emergency departments and 0.33 hospital outpatient departments.

In this scenario, the rate at which a susceptible person in region j becomes infectious (that is transitions to the I compartment in region j) depends on: (1) the risk of infection from those in the same region j, (2) the risk of infection from infected people from region i who traveled to region j, and (3) the risk of infection encountered when traveling from region j to region i.

Although it would have been possible to use the posteriors directly from prior years, and thus preserve correlation structure in those distributions, we chose not to do this for two reasons. First, for the parameters we were informing, there was little correlation. Second, by fitting to a 1-D Gaussian, we were able to state precisely the prior assumptions for our actual forecast and quickly assess the degree to which they are informative.

Each region has its own informed prior which is allowed to change from one epidemic week to the other. The Gaussian informed prior provides a simple way to penalize the likelihood when the parameter values sampled by the MCMC procedure are far from what was observed in a past similar season. To allow for an informed prior that is less restrictive, we also use a heated informed prior, where the Gaussian temperature is increased by an order of magnitude (which is equivalent to increasing the variance by a factor of ten).

However, these historically augmented time points were not counted within the likelihood with the same weight as actual observations. The weighting was equal to the value of the Pearson correlation between the observed data in the current year and the historical data for the same period from the year used for augmentation. We shifted from the historic data to the most similar data at epidemic week 6 (EW06) when we subjectively determined that the current season is very different from the historic average.

Although we drew on results from a large set of mechanistic models, our single forecast for each metric was made after choosing between available model results for that metric in that week and was therefore somewhat subjective. We performed poorly at the start of the competition when our mechanistic models consistently over-estimated incidence. However, during the middle phase of the season, our models produced less biased estimates and consistently outperformed non-mechanistic models based on the average of historical data. A robust testing of model variants using historical data suggests that spatially coupled models are systematically better than historical NULL models during the middle of the season and are not significantly worse even at the start of the season. We evaluated a simple ensemble and showed that the subjective model choice was better. However, the ranking of individual models suggests that an ensemble of coupled models may outperform our subjective choice. We are considering exactly this experiment for the upcoming season.",

Although this could be viewed as a limitation of our work, because individual subjective decisions cannot be reproduced, we suggest that the explicit description of a partially subjective process is a strength. In weather forecasting, there is a long history of evaluating the accuracy of entirely objective forecasts versus partially subjective forecasts [30, 31]. Broadly, for each different forecast target and each forecast lead-time, there has been a gradual progression over time such that objective forecasts become more accurate than subjective forecasts. We note also that although we describe the subjective process as it was conducted, we also provide a thorough retrospective assessment of the predictive performance of each model variant.",
