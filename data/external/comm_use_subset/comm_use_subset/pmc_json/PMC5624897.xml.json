Compared with GL, GAMG has strongeranti-tumour, anti-allergy and anti-inflammatory pharmacological activities, and is easily permeates the cell membrane because of its weaker polarity3,4. GAMG also serves as an artificial functional low-calorie sweetener; its sweetness is 941-fold greater than that of sucrose, and 5-fold more than that of GL5,6. However, GAMG is quite rare in natural plants and only can be produced by biosynthesis or hydrolysis of GL. It is very significant, therefore, to transform GL to GAMG with high efficiency.",

            "text": "Because of the similar reactivity of the O-glycosidic bond for the two glucuronides, it is not easy to directionally synthesize GAMG from GL by chemical methods. As an eco-friendly method with high specificity, mild reaction conditions and catalytic efficiency, the biotransformation of GAMG from GL is a preferred method (Fig. 1a). So far, all the \u03b2-glucuronidases that can convert GL to GAMG derive from enterobacteria2,7, fungi8\u201310 and animal organisms11, which are limited by the low selectivity of the O-glycosidic bond, weak enzymatic activity and high production cost, respectively. Therefore, the industrial conversion of GL to GAMG is still in an early stage and is not a major contributor for the growing market. Previously, we reported that the fungus Penicillium purpurogenum Li-3 can produce \u03b2-glucuronidase with high chemical bond selectivity10. When grown in liquid media, it hydrolyzed GL to GAMG directly. However, the conversion ratio of GL was only 88.45% after 96 h of fermentation, indicating that the amount and activities of the enzymes were relatively low. Therefore, it is essential to figure out how to increase the enzyme activity of \u03b2-glucuronidase and reduce the production cost of GAMG.\n",

We speculated that the production cost of GAMG could be reduced by adding P. purpurogenum Li-3 directly to the total extract of glycyrrhiza (TEG). However, we could not find any GAMG despite TEG having a high content of GL (7.3%). Interestingly, the activity of \u03b2-glucuronidase increased about threefold when an appropriate amount of TEG was added to a culture medium that contained GL as its carbon source13 (mass ratio of TEG to GL was 1:1).",

We separated the total flavonoids of glycyrrhiza (TFG), the total triterpenoids of glycyrrhiza (TTG), and the total saccharides of glycyrrhiza (TSG) from TEG and tested the effects of each component on the whole-cell enzymatic activity of \u03b2-glucuronidase from P. purpurogenumLi-3 by adding them into the media containing GL. The components that increased the enzymatic activities were further isolated and analysed via adding them into enzyme solution that contained the GL to determine the effective compound. The results indicated that isoliquiritigenin (ISL) greatly enhances the conversion of GL, which could potentially reduce the raw material cost during the fermentation process. We concluded that the ISL in the TFG enhances \u03b2-glucuronidase activity as an activator. Furthermore, the mechanism of the high activity of the \u03b2-glucuronidase was explored. Michaelis-Menten model calculations indicated that ISL promotes the affinity of \u03b2-glucuronidase for the substrate GL. The K\nm value decreased significantly compared to the control, whereas the V\nmax increased. A calculation based on the Arrhenius equation showed that ISL decreased the activation energy by 6.31%compared to the control, which indicated that adding ISL could effectively stabilize the enzyme-substrate transition state. The research flow chart is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The novelty of this report is that we identify ISL as the activator of \u03b2-glucuronidase, which has a promising future for the bioconversion GL to GAMG. Our work may also shed new light on the industrial production of GAMG.",

Fu et al.14 separated liquorice flavonoids and glycyrrhizic acid by using macroporous resins. However, the final purity was only 66% and the extraction was time-consuming. Sun et al. and Shen et al.15,16 studied the separation of glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin by aqueous two-phase extraction with a non-ionic surfactant and three-liquid-phase extraction systems, respectively. However, the non-ionic surfactant that was used, Triton X-100, was costly, and the procedure of the latter method was complex. In our study, we found that pH had a significant effect on the extraction of the three components of Glycyrrhiza. Extraction by changing the pH of the solution twice offers the highest separation capacity for TFG, TSG and TTG with high extraction recovery, procedural simplicity and low cost. Moreover, the recovery (97%) is 5% higher than previously reported for other methods17. In addition, our method is patented18.",

The apparent activation energy for the catalysis of GL was calculated (Fig. 6b, Table 3) using the Arrhenius equation.

After the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex (ES) from the substrate and enzyme, only a fraction of the ES could be converted to the proper product (P). Part of the ES could reversibly and conformationally change to form an inactive enzyme-substrate complex (ES2) that induces substrate inhibition effects on enzyme activity. Previously, Pesheck, P. et al.30 observed that t-butanol could increase the activity of \u03b2-glucuronidase by 9-fold. Although t-butanol could increase the Vmax of the conversion from ES to P, the activation of \u03b2-glucuronidase by t-butanol is mainly due to a decrease in the inactive form ES2, which reduces the substrate inhibition effect. Solvents such as chloroform exhibit paradoxical activation effect on the activities of \u03b2-glucuronidases from bacteria and mammalian cells. Although chloroform, as a protein-denaturing agent, has strong denaturing and harmful effects on both bacteria and mammalian \u03b2-glucuronidases, the addition of chloroform in the reaction system could significantly increase the conversion rate of the corresponding \u03b2-glucuronidase-dependent reaction. Therefore, apparently, chloroform is an activator of \u03b2-glucuronidase. Michael T. proved that the mechanism of this paradoxical effect is that chloroform could serve as an emulsifier to increase the surface area of the liquid-liquid interface31. As an emulsifier, chloroform increased the collisions and interactions between \u03b2-glucuronidase and substrates, eventually increasing the substrate conversion rate and other activity parameters.",

Among them, ISL, as a chalcone, has the lowest polarity and could be categorized as a water repellent compound. Therefore, we hypothesized that ISL might function as an activator through both mechanisms. First, as a non-polar compound, ISL is likely to be able to bind \u03b2-glucuronidase and stabilize the conformation of \u03b2-glucuronidase. This interaction could increase the formation of active ES, reduce the conversion from active ES to inactive ES2, and eventually increase the conversion from ES to P. Other isolated compounds have no such effect due to the steric hindrance. Second, ISL, with similar character as organic solvents, has the potential to increase the specific surface area of the contact between \u03b2-glucuronidase and its substrate, therefore increasing the rate of substrate conversion to its corresponding products by \u03b2-glucuronidase. Taken together, in this study, we found that ISL, a compound that was isolated from the TEG, is a very efficient activator of the enzyme \u03b2-glucuronidase. ISL could greatly enhance the conversion of GL, which could potentially reduce raw material costs during the fermentation process.",

To identify the activator of \u03b2-glucuronidase to potentially decrease the industrial production cost, we added a variety of compounds that were isolated from the TEG into the in vivo fermentation or in vitro enzymatic assay systems. We concluded that ISL could enhance the enzymatic activities of PGUS. ISL remained unmodified and could be utilized repeatedly. Therefore, the total cost of the production process could be potentially significantly reduced because the steps to purify GL from the TEG could be removed. This study sheds new light on the mechanism of \u03b2-glucuronidase and helps to make the industrial production of GAMG through fermentation feasible.",
