HPV infections cause cervical and head and neck cancers, while HIV infections cause Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma1. The prostate gland is an organ that is easily exposed to infections of the urogenital tract. The innate immune response of the urogenital epithelium provides the first line of defense against pathogens and may protect against urogenital cancers. Accordingly, studies have reported an association between prostate cancer risk and mutations or genetic variants in innate immune response genes2,3. However, the evidence for an association between STI and prostate cancer remains inconclusive. Multiple epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between lifetime number of sexual partners, as a proxy for STI, and prostate cancer risk and reported both positive4\u201311 and null associations12\u201315. Therefore, we hypothesized that discordance in these observations could be due to residual confounding by unknown host factors modifying the relationship between STI and prostate cancer.",

            "text": "One of the host factors of importance for innate immune response to STI could be a germline dinucleotide polymorphism, rs368234815 (TT or \u0394G alleles), in the IFNL4 gene that encodes IFN-\u03bb4, a type-III interferon16,17. The \u0394G allele creates an open reading frame for IFN-\u03bb4, thus this interferon can only be produced in carriers of the \u0394G allele. Paradoxically, although IFN-\u03bb4 is an antiviral cytokine and a potent inducer of the JAK-STAT pathway, individuals carrying the IFNL4-\u0394G allele have impaired ability to clear certain viral infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)16,18,19, cytomegalovirus20,21, coronavirus22,23, and possibly HIV24. This effect has been attributed to increased induction of negative regulators of interferon signaling by IFN-\u03bb4 that could affect the function of other interferons16,17. We recently showed that IFNL4-\u0394G is closely associated with the occurrence of an interferon signature, termed Interferon-related DNA Damage Resistance Signature (IRDS), in prostate tumors of African-American patients with decreased overall survival in this patient group25. Thus, IFNL4-\u0394G may have a significant function in prostate cancer biology.",

Cases and controls had similar age and BMI distributions. More cases, compared to controls, had a first degree family history of prostate cancer (11% vs. 7%, P = 0.003, Chi-square test), whereas fewer cases than controls had a college or graduate-level degree (32% vs. 50%, P < 0.001, Chi-square test). Additionally, more cases were current smokers than controls (25% vs. 15%, P < 0.001, Chi-square test). Among the 976 cases, 138 men (14%) had advanced disease (stage 3 or 4 prostate cancer). High Gleason score (>7) was reported in 167 patients (17%). Both AA and EA men had similar Gleason score distribution, but AA men tended to have higher blood PSA levels at diagnosis. A greater proportion of EA (16%) men, compared with AA men (13%), presented with an advanced disease in this cohort. Based on the combination of low/high-grade and localized/advanced disease (see Methods), 732 and 244 cases were assigned into groups of nonaggressive and aggressive prostate cancer, respectively.",

These relationships were statistically significant in an analysis of all men combined or when we stratified into controls and cases. The lifetime number of sexual partners also correlated with the likelihood of contracting gonorrhea in an exposure-dependent manner (Supplementary Table 2), and the likelihood of contracting gonorrhea was increased with a higher lifetime number of sexual partners (Ptrend < 0.001), further validating the utility of this proxy variable to infer likelihood of exposure to STI.",

Table 2 presents the associations of sexual activity during early adulthood (up to age 39) and throughout lifetime with prostate cancer. We did not observe a significant association between the number of sexual partners when the men were teens and their risk of developing prostate cancer later in life, according to the multivariable model, although a trend towards an increased risk was observed in the univariate analysis. On the other hand, when considering the number of sexual partners during an individual\u2019s 20s and 30s, individuals who had 10 or more sexual partners had a 41% and 59% increased odd of prostate cancer, respectively, compared with men who had 0\u20131 partners. Similarly, when considering the total number of sexual partners through the life course, men who had 20 or more sexual partners had a 47% increased odd of prostate cancer. These associations were significant in the multivariable model and were also dose-dependent. For example, men who had 10 or more sexual partners had more risk than those who had 2\u20139 sexual partners during their 20s (Ptrend = 0.029) and 30s (Ptrend = 0.001). Our findings indicate that increased exposure to STI during early adulthood elevates individuals\u2019 risk of developing prostate cancer later in life, suggesting that STI may play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer. These findings were observed in both EA and AA men. However, we noted a more robust risk association among the AA men (Table 2).",

To investigate whether IFNL4-\u0394G modifies the association between likelihood of exposure to STI and prostate cancer risk, we stratified the participants into those with one or two \u0394G alleles vs. none. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 3, the adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that the increased risk of prostate cancer associated with sexual activity was restricted to carriers of at least one \u0394G allele. For instance, among individuals that had 10 or more sexual partners in their 20s, the odds of diagnosis with prostate cancer for men with at least one \u0394G allele vs. none was 1.68-fold (95% CI: 1.16, 2.43) vs. 1.05-fold (95% CI: 0.59, 1.87), respectively.

To increase the statistical power to test this hypothesis, we combined individuals with moderate likelihood of exposure (2\u20139 sexual partners) with the highest likelihood of exposure (10+sexual partners) and compared their risk to the reference group (0\u20131 sexual partners). As shown in Supplementary Table 4, among those with an increased likelihood of exposure to STI in their 20s, 30s, or during their lifetime, the odds of diagnosis with prostate cancer were higher in carriers of \u0394G/\u0394G than of \u0394G/TT or TT/TT genotypes. Again, there was no significant relationship between the number of sexual partners and prostate cancer risk among TT/TT carriers. However, \u0394G/\u0394G carriers who had two or more sexual partners in their 20s and 30s, or had 20 or more sexual partners during their lifetime, had increased risk. For instance, for men with two or more sexual partners vs. none during their 30s, the odds ratios increased from 1.05 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.57) to 1.62 (95% CI: 1.16, 2.27) to 1.86 (95% CI: 1.17, 2.95) if their IFNL4 genotypes were TT/TT, \u0394G/TT, or \u0394G/\u0394G, respectively.

Notably, the strongest evidence for a gene\u2013environment interaction revealed an association of this interaction with the odds of developing the aggressive disease (Table 4), where both IFNL4-\u0394G and multiple lifetime sexual partners synergistically increased the odds for aggressive prostate cancer (P interaction = 0.004).

Given that the allele frequency is higher in AA, we stratified our analysis by race/ethnicity. We found that the odds of being diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in men who had 10 or more sexual partners in their 20s or 30s (or 20 or more lifetime partners) was higher among AA men than EA men (Table 6), consistent with the increased frequency of the IFNL4-\u0394G risk allele in AA compared to any other racial group. For AA men, having multiple sexual partners (10 or more) in their 30s, increased their odds of diagnosis with aggressive prostate cancer by 207% vs. only by 43% for nonaggressive prostate cancer (Table 6). Similarly, in men with at least one copy of the \u0394G allele, having multiple sexual partners in their 30s was associated with 182% increased odds of a diagnosis with aggressive prostate cancer vs. only 56% for nonaggressive prostate cancer (Table 5).

In SeV-infected human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, we observed a robust induction of the transcripts in the IFNL4 region (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 5). Of note, mRNA induction is not allele-specific and can be detected in cells with the TT/TT genotype, although expression is generally lower with the TT/TT genotype due to nonsense-mediated decay of prematurely terminated out-of-frame transcripts16. However, IFN-\u03bb4 protein can be produced only in the presence of the \u0394G allele. Indeed, our Western blot analysis showed that IFN-\u03bb4 was strongly induced in the SeV-infected PC3 cells that have the \u0394G/\u0394G genotype but not in DU145 cells that have the TT/TT genotype (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 2).",

Our observations were consistent across age group and IFNL4 genotype strata. Furthermore, the odds of developing prostate cancer, particularly of an aggressive type, increased with the number of sexual partners in men carrying the IFNL4-\u0394G allele. As AA are more likely than EA men to carry the \u0394G allele, the effect was more pronounced in the former population. The identification of this novel gene\u2013environment interaction suggests an association between a yet unidentified infectious agent and prostate cancer risk in men with IFNL4-\u0394G.

Yet, epidemiologic evidence for the association of STI with prostate cancer is still not firmly established. Multiple studies with self-reported exposure to any STI or to the most common, symptomatic STI (i.e. gonorrhea) have reported a positive association4,6,8,9,11,14,28\u201331, resembling the epidemiologic literature for cervical cancer before the discovery of HPV as the etiologic agent. In our study, we observed that self-reported exposure to gonorrhea increased the odds of diagnosis with prostate cancer by about 30% (Supplementary Table 6), which is in concordance with the 200532 and the 201533 meta-analysis data that reported a 35% and 31% increase in risk, respectively. The search for prostate cancer etiologic agents also encompassed sero-epidemiologic evaluations of the association between prostate cancer risk and infection with human herpesvirus 8, herpes simplex type 2, HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, but the reported findings are far from conclusive34\u201345. Although our observations of a gene\u2013environment interaction related to a STI do not implicate a specific STI, they suggest that exposure to some sexually transmitted etiologic agent(s) may lead to prostate cancer, but only in genetically susceptible individuals.",

Until now, a detectable induction of endogenous IFN-\u03bb4 protein was only shown for hepatic cells16,17. Once induced, IFN-\u03bb4 protein may enhance negative regulation of IFN signaling, leading to impaired viral clearance and a distinct tumor biology in carriers of IFNL4-\u0394G allele, as previously reported16,17,25.

This is in line with the health disparity in prostate cancer that manifests as a more aggressive and deadly disease in AA compared to other racial groups. Moreover, the findings of this study are also consistent with our previous work where we observed a distinct interferon signature that was more prevalent in tumors from AA than EA men25,46. A role of the interferon-inducible system in the pathogenesis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer is further suggested by germline mutations in RNASEL, a gene involved in the interferon antiviral pathway, that were found to predispose men to familial prostate cancer2,47.",

On the contrary, men with the IFNL4-TT variant did not bear a similar STI-associated prostate cancer risk even if they had as many partners. However, IFNL4-\u0394G may not predispose to prostate cancer in the context of all STI. For example, it has been shown that a herpesvirus infection and its latency confer protection from bacterial infections48. Thus, chronic viral infection in carriers of IFNL4-\u0394G may lead to a decreased risk for a bacterial infection. Accordingly, we found that the association of gonorrhea with prostate cancer was stronger for IFNL4-TT/TT than IFNL4-\u0394G carriers (Supplementary Table 6), arguing that the overall unfavorable association of IFNL4-\u0394G with prostate cancer, as shown in our study, is more likely related to an infectious agent of viral origin.

In general, case-control study designs are influenced by inherent biases including recall, response, and interviewer biases. Our study should not be affected by interviewer bias since sexual history information was acquired through a self-administered questionnaire filled in privacy. However, we relied on retrospective, self-reported assessment of sexual history, which is vulnerable to recall bias. In our view, it is unlikely that the general population is aware of the infectious hypothesis in the context of prostate cancer, arguing against a recall bias. Additionally, the fact that the self-reported number of sexual partners could be used to infer exposure to gonorrhea in both cases and controls in a similar manner suggests that the case-control status did not influence self-reported sexual history (Supplementary Table 2). Likewise, the fact that we observed STI-associated prostate cancer risks exclusively in men with at least one copy of the \u0394G allele, whereas not in men with the TT/TT genotype, albeit both groups having reported multiple sexual partners, makes it rather unlikely that a recall bias contributed to these findings. As we report an association of IFNL4-\u0394G with disease risk in the context of sexual activity, there could only be confounding/bias in this observation if the men knew their IFNL4 genotype, which they certainly did not, and then reported sexual activity biased by this knowledge. To further buttress the validity of our observations, we also found a significant relationship between a gonorrhea infection history and prostate cancer in a very consistent manner with recent meta-analyses32,33. Yet, it remains a limitation that we could not validate our findings in a second cohort. Our study population is rather unique having AA subjects, an in-depth survey about sexual activity, and germline DNA for genotyping, making it difficult to replicate our findings without the requirement for additional recruitment. Nevertheless, the fact that we observed a dose response relationship that fits a biologically plausible mechanism suggests that the associations we observed warrant further investigations, including prospective cohorts.",

Although our findings do not implicate a specific STI, they strongly argue for an infection as an etiologic agent for prostate cancer in a substantial subset of patients. Whether the observed association is due to carcinogenic effects of a putative etiologic infectious agent or rather due to the host\u2019s response to the infectious agent needs to be examined in future work. Our data suggest that the etiology of prostate cancer may vary in population groups due to the ancestry-related genetic variation in resolution or progression of an infection following exposure. The proposed synergistic mechanism of prostate cancer pathophysiology is relevant for all populations but could disproportionally affect men of African ancestry. As such, these findings may shed light on the prostate cancer health disparity.",

Expression of GAPDH was used as a loading control. Shown are results of biological duplicates of cells non-infected (\u2212) and infected (+) with SeV. Recombinant purified IFN-\u03bb4 (2.5 ng) was used as a positive control; glycosylation of endogenous IFN-\u03bb4 produced in mammalian cells increases its molecular weight compared to non-glycosylated recombinant protein produced in E. coli. IFN-\u03bb4 expression is detected in PC3 cells (\u0394G/\u0394G genotype) but not in DU145 cells (TT/TT genotype).
