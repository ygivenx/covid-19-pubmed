Peaks were observed at elution volumes of 50\u201375 and 85 ml in the chromatogram (Fig. 1A). The peak at 85 ml corresponded to that of monomeric HT cyt c552. The ratio of the absorption at 410 nm to that at 280 nm (Abs410/Abs280) for the fractions at 50\u201375 ml was about 3.6 (Fig. 1A). Heme staining was performed for the sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-PAGE gel of the fractions obtained by size exclusion chromatography to investigate the presence of heme c (Fig. 1B). A main band with a mass corresponding to the molecular weight of HT cyt c552 (9.2 kDa) was detected in all of the fractions at 50\u201375 ml. This value corresponded well to that of HT cyt c552. Therefore, we attributed the peak at 50\u201375 ml to HT cyt c552 oligomers. However, no oligomers were detected in the chromatogram when HT cyt c552 and cyt c552 free E. coli lysate were freeze-thawed together (Supplementary information, Fig. S1), indicating that HT cyt c552 oligomers were formed in E. coli by non-covalent association of its monomers.",

The monomer, dimer, and higher-order oligomer (higher than dimer) amounts were estimated from the peak areas in the chromatograms of WT and mutant proteins (Fig. 5 and Supplementary information, Fig. S3). The amount of high-order oligomers decreased in the order of WT > I76V > A5F/M11V > Y32F/Y41E > quintuple mutant, corresponding to the decrease in protein stability.

Peaks were observed at ~44 and 50\u201362 ml in the Ni affinity chromatograms of the solution obtained by folding in the absence and presence of the apo protein (Supplementary information, Fig. S4A).

Therefore, the 280-nm absorbance in the Ni affinity chromatogram for the solution containing the apo protein was not twice as high as that without the apo protein. The 410-nm absorption at ~59 ml in the Ni affinity chromatogram increased by performing folding in the presence of the apo protein compared to that in the absence of it, indicating that the oligomers containing the holo protein increased by the addition of the apo protein during folding.

Oligomers of HT cyt c552 were detected when it was expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1), and the amount of oligomers increased when the amount of HT cyt c552 expressed was increased (Fig. 4).

In addition, the apo protein was not detected in the mass spectra of the fractions of the oligomers in the Ni affinity chromatogram of the quintuple mutant (Fig. 3F\u2013H). For refolding in vitro, the WT holo protein formed oligomers with its apo protein, whereas the quintuple mutant did not (Supplementary information, Fig. S4). The \u03b1-helical content of the apo protein of the WT protein and quintuple mutant was estimated at 19% and 11%, respectively, according to the circular dichroism (CD) spectra, whereas that of the holo protein was estimated at 49% and 42%, respectively (Supplementary information, Fig. S5). These results showed that the holo and apo proteins of the quintuple mutant were unfolded more compared to the corresponding forms of the WT protein. The stability of the mutant oligomer containing the apo form may decrease compared to that of the WT protein oligomer due to decrease in protein stability, causing decrease in formation of the domain-swapped oligomers in E. coli.",

When a holo protein is formed, it creates a transient oligomer with an apo protein. A heme is inserted to the apo protein of the transient holo-apo complex, refolding to a domain-swapped dimer. Higher order oligomers may form when an apo protein interacts with two holo proteins. For less stable proteins, the holo-apo complex dissociates to holo and apo monomers, eventually forming only holo monomers. Although apo cyt c has been shown to decompose by DegP protease at the periplasm of E. coli41, the apo protein of thermostable HT cyt c552 survives from decomposition in the cells by forming a transient complex with its holo proteins. Our results reveal that more domain-swapped oligomers are formed for more stable proteins, and exceedingly stable proteins may have disadvantages by forming oligomer by-products in cells.",
