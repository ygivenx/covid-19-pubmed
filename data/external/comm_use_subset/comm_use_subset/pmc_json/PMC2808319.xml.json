Quarantine is the segregation of healthy persons exposed to an infectious disease from unexposed persons, until the exposed person becomes ill or the incubation period has passed [2,5]. Quarantine is also one of the most controversial measures available in outbreak control, with important impacts on economic activity and civil liberties [6,7]. Public health agencies need to have weighed evidence of the potential costs and benefits of these manoeuvres before the next outbreak of a severe, novel infection [8,9] and to have publicly and widely communicated the importance of planned control measures [6,10]. This makes outcome evaluation of modern quarantine activity an important area for research [2,4,6].",

Statistical estimates used in health decision-making tend to derive from differences in outcome rates in treated versus non-treated individuals (e.g., risk difference, RD; attributable risk, AR and population attributable risk, PAR) [12,13,15], as well as variations on the number needed to treat (NNT) statistic [11,15-20]. Research to evaluate the impact of modern quarantine is less well-developed, and no clear tradition has emerged in the measures of association used to communicate net harm and benefit. The quantitative impact of control measures for infectious diseases is commonly assessed using variants of the effective reproductive number, R (the average observed number of secondary infections per index cases in an observed population). Rt the daily effective reproductive number, is the observed number of secondary cases to index case at a specific time. When Rt, has a value below1.0, this is evidence that an outbreak is dying out [21].",

Contacts included had non-overlapping periods of exposure to SARS index cases within 10 days, as previously reported [23]. The total number of community contacts associated with these index cases, for this analysis, was 8,498. This number excluded health care providers who were contacts of those SARS index cases only as a result of providing care to SARS cases, but included health care workers exposed through social or family contacts. Community contacts were classified by closest level of exposure to the index case (e.g., level 1 being closest at \u226530 minutes within a distance of one metre [23]). For all community contacts, outcome status as a secondary SARS case was defined [23]. We also consider data for an additional 140 individuals who were quarantined as contacts of a known SARS case, became ill and were considered to be potential cases themselves, but who subsequently had SARS ruled out. These additional 140 observations were used only in sensitivity analyses.",

The outcome was whether or not each contact became a SARS case (binary outcome). The predictor variable of interest was whether the associated index case had been in community quarantine at symptom onset. This, seemingly intuitive, analysis treats the individuals in whom the outcome is measured as though they were assigned to treatment conditions. Therefore, information regarding quarantine status is used only from the 204 SARS index cases with one or more community contacts. In place of typical logistic regression which would yield an odds ratio (OR), we obtained risk difference (na\u00efve secondary attack rate difference - ignoring index cases with no contacts) as the measure of association, using a generalized linear regression model with binomial error term and identity link function. Clustering of multiple contacts to index cases was accounted for using robust variance estimates [24,25].",

These included the secondary case count ratio or SSCR, the ratio of secondary cases (per index case) in the quarantine condition relative to the non-quarantine condition. The SSCR is a function of the ratio of secondary cases per quarantined index case (SCq) and of the ratio of secondary cases per non-quarantined index case (SCnq) as discussed below.

IRR is equal to the exponent of the beta coefficient for the regression term of interest [26,27]. For Poisson models used here, no offset was specified for the number of community contacts at risk for each index case. Said differently, the outcome variable here is not the rate of secondary transmission among a variable number of potentially exposed community contacts per index case, but the number of secondary SARS cases arising from an index case. The SCCR is the exponentiated beta term for this model (where quarantine status was entered as a binary variable). SCCR is the ratio of (secondary cases per quarantined index case, SCq) to (secondary cases per non-quarantined index case, SCnq); therefore, SCCR = SCq/SCnq.",

A review of simulation studies on quarantine effectiveness for SARS has been presented by Bauch and colleagues [9]. This review, and other individual reports [43] suggest that quarantine measures are most effective when mobilized at the very start of the outbreak when numbers are small. While decision-makers must rely heavily on simulation studies, a persistent concern raised [33] is that results are driven by prior assumptions; which may be unrealistic. Simulations rely on some degree of simplification such as considering only point-source outbreaks in non-overlapping populations. More sophisticated models incorporate heterogeneity in parameters including variations in size and behaviour of human contact networks, differences in transmissibility due to the host, and levels of adherence with control measures, such that scenarios simulated reflect what happens in real-world experiences [4,33,44,45]. Simulation studies, typically, do not present impact statistics familiar to health policy makers, and may not provide evidence as compelling to decision-makers as real world outbreak experiences. To give an example, a recent World Health Organization review on control measures for influenza cited no simulation studies but only real-world observational data [46].",

Some of these reports appeared well after the outbreak, with efforts made to complete data on onset dates and transmission in hindsight (e.g., [42]). Drawing inference from epidemic curves suits only point-source outbreaks, and amount to one-group, pre-test post-test designs [47], providing weak evidence for causation. The true value of case reports, arguably, is the rich contextual information on challenges faced and unexpected events, and showing socio-political feasibility of aggressive control across settings [40].",

This is also an uncommon example of presentation of R estimates along with confidence limits from observed (as opposed to simulated) data.

Our point estimate of NNQ for the Ontario outbreak was 7.5 persons in quarantine to one SARS case averted using data from probable or suspected SARS cases. As a point estimate, this NNQ compares very favourably with NNTs reported for public health interventions such as chemoprophylaxis for leprosy [50] and meningococcal disease [51], or vaccination against pertussis [52] and influenza and pneumococcal disease [53], particularly with a condition like SARS with significant morbidity and a high case-fatality rate.

Clinical decision-making looks at outcomes in the same individuals assigned to treatment. Interventions such as vaccination are more complex in that outcomes may be assessed at the individual or population level, with different implications, although the individual vaccinated is part of the same population. Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV) has been estimated incorporating herd immunity [52]. The case of quarantine is distinct even from vaccination, in that all potential benefit is to other persons. It is theoretically possible to study sets of index cases and their contacts as independent units of analysis, although it is often difficult to identify precisely which persons exposed which others [43]. Here, we have worked with contacts matched to an exclusive index case [23]. The creation of sets of cases and associated controls goes only part-way toward a complete network-based analysis [33], although future studies could address non-independence of networks.",

This was not feasible. Practices varied with respect to when a record was initiated (i.e., in one health unit a file might have been opened even with an unfounded inquiry, elsewhere a record was generated only with a confirmed contact link and symptoms). Within Public Health records, we were able to confirm 140 quarantined false positive \"cases\". These cases were quarantined contacts who became ill with possible SARS symptoms but were subsequently excluded as SARS cases, and they had at least one identified community contact. Future cost-benefit studies should include information on such groups (e.g., [36]). Legitimate costs are incurred for and by these false positive cases and their contacts which should be taken into account. Because people without the disease can't spread it, uneven distribution of such individuals across infection control conditions being compared could bias estimates of impact. As we found, the rate of false positive cases (resulting in no transmission) may have a large influence on the apparent benefit. Several case-reports discussed problems with prospective record-keeping, in terms of detailed contact tracing and the implications of time-lags in serological testing (including those never tested), as challenges to both outbreak management and research [4,35,41].",

Measures to restrict close contact probably made an important contribution to the control of SARS outbreaks [46]. Evidence of this is accumulating slowly and should be taken into consideration for future outbreaks of SARS or similar droplet spread agents without significant transmission in the asymptomatic phase. However, the applicability of this evidence to the current experience with pandemic influenza is less certain. Ferguson et al [58] present simulation data suggesting community quarantine and isolation may play a role in influenza control but comment that this would presume such measures were feasible. Transmission patterns for influenza however, make it less likely that contact tracing and quarantine would be fast enough to avoid transmission which is greatest in the earliest stage of infection [46]. Under such circumstances, use of a 'severe' [57] measure such as quarantine is likely not justified where such efforts are likely to yield little benefit.",
