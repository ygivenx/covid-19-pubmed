            "text": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction (MI) and the development of heart failure [1]. RAS blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improves cardiac remodeling and outcomes in both experimental models of MI as well as in humans [1]. ACE metabolizes angiotensin (Ang) I to form Ang II, which is of key importance in the pathophysiology of the RAS in the heart [2]. Recently, ACE2, a new member of the RAS, was found to function as a negative regulator of the Ang system by metabolizing Ang II to a putatively protective peptide Ang-(1\u20137) with high efficiency [3]. ACE2 is present in the heart, and a reduction in its expression is associated with enhanced cardiac hypertrophy and reduced pumping ability [4,5]. Although ACE2 was initially localized exclusively in cardiac endothelial cells, more recent studies demonstrate ACE2 immunoreactivity in both the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of myocardial vessels as well as in cardiomyocytes [4,5]. After MI, there is significant activation of cardiac ACE2 in rats and humans, which acts to combat the adverse effects of an activated cardiac RAS [4]. Other evidence for a cardioprotective role for ACE2 arises from studies in ACE2-knockout mice where the loss of ACE2 facilitates adverse post-MI ventricular remodeling, and studies showing that ACE2 overexpression in MI rats improves cardiac contractility and remodeling [6,7]. It has been reported that ACE2 serum activity rises during the first week following acute MI and that ACE2 activation may be a compensatory mechanism in advanced heart failure [8].",

Insulin signaling can promote glucose uptake, glycolytic flux and glucose oxidation, and improve ischemic tolerance of the heart [10-12]. The protective effects of insulin on the heart are mediated via activation of a signaling pathway involving the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) [9,13,14]. Previous studies have demonstrated that a common polymorphism in the IRS-1 gene, the Arg972 IRS-1 polymorphism, in which a Gly/Arg substitution takes place at codon 972 (Arg972), is associated with impaired IRS-1 ability to activate the downstream factor phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), leading to diminished activity of insulin [15,16].",

            "text": "To explore the potential causal relationship between Arg972 IRS-1 and serum ACE2 levels in acute MI subjects, we performed in vitro experiments using human cardiomyocytes treated with hypoxia. Expression vectors for wild type IRS-1 and Arg972 IRS-1 were stably transfected into cardiomyocytes. Endogenous IRS-1 was stably knocked down by shRNA. As shown in Figure 1, stably transfected cells showed marked increase in the protein detected by an anti-IRS-1 antibody, indicating that wild type IRS-1 or Arg972 IRS-1 was overexpressed in the transfected cardiomyocytes. Compared with cells stably transduced with scramble control shRNA, cells stably transduced with IRS-1 shRNA showed over 80% knockdown of endogenous IRS-1 (Figure 1). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed that in the absence of insulin, the ACE2 mRNA level remained at a basal level in all experimental groups under either normoxia or hypoxia (Table 6). In the presence of insulin (1 mg/L), the ACE2 mRNA level was significantly elevated in the controls. In normoxia, while overexpression of wild type or Arg972 IRS-1 did not significantly change the ACE2 mRNA level, both IRS-1 shRNA and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished insulin-induced elevation of the ACE2 mRNA level (Table 6). Cardiomyocytes were then exposed to hypoxia to simulate oxygen deprivation during MI. After 24 hours of culture under hypoxia plus insulin (1 mg/L), the control cells showed significantly elevated ACE2 mRNA levels compared to the controls under normoxia+insulin (Table 6). Overexpression of Arg972 IRS-1 markedly decreased the ACE2 mRNA level in cardiomyocytes under hypoxia (Table 6). Both IRS-1 shRNA and LY294002 abolished the induction of ACE2 mRNA by insulin plus hypoxia (Table 6). The results were confirmed at the ACE2 protein level by western blot analyses, which also showed that ACE2 was expressed at a constitutively low level in cardiomyocytes under normoxia (Figure 2). ELISA showed that secreted/soluble ACE2 levels in the culture media of cardiomyocytes followed the same data trend (Table 7). The findings indicate that insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling is required for ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes, and that hypoxia can markedly enhance the induction effect of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. As ACE2 reportedly is shed by sheddase ADAM17 to produce soluble ACE2 [23], and ADAM17 expression reportedly is regulated by hypoxia [24], we next examined ADAM17 shedding activities in human cardiomyocytes under the same experimental conditions as in Table 7. As shown in Figure 3, the ADAM17 shedding activity was significantly up-regulated by hypoxia in cardiomyocytes. However, overexpression or knockdown of IRS-1, overexpression of Arg972 IRS-1, or inhibition of PI3K showed no significant effects on the ADAM17 activity in cardiomyocytes with or without insulin, indicating that insulin signaling had no significant effect on the ADAM17 shedding activity in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the effects of Arg972 IRS-1 on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes did not involve a shedding mechanism. In addition, we found no association between Arg972-IRS-1 variants and the ACE2 1075AA, 16854GG or 8790AA genotypes in female acute MI patients, or the ACE2 1075A/G-8790A/G-16854G/C haplotype GGC in male acute MI patients (data not shown).",

Increasing evidence show that the expression of cardiac ACE2 is increased after MI, which acts to combat the adverse effects of an activated cardiac RAS and therefore may be a compensatory mechanism in MI [1,4,8]. In agreement with this, in subjects who had blood samples collected before and after MI, we observed a significant increase in the ACE2 serum level after MI. Arg972-IRS-1 carriers had significantly lower serum ACE2 levels and higher MI severity scores compared with wild type-IRS-1 carriers after MI, confirming the cardioprotective role of increased ACE2 levels after MI. The findings also suggest an important role for insulin/IRS-1 signaling in the increased ACE2 expression after MI, since Arg972-IRS-1 is associated with impaired IRS-1 ability to activate PI3K, which leads to diminished activity of insulin [15,16]. We demonstrated in vitro that a shedding mechanism was not involved in the effects of Arg972 IRS-1 on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling directly targets ACE2 expression.",

Our western blot analysis results showed that ACE2 was expressed at a constitutively low level in cardiomyocytes in normoxia. This may explain why overexpression of Arg972 IRS-1 had no significant effect on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes in normoxia, where a small amount of endogenous wild type IRS-1 in the cells may well suffice for basal level of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling and ACE2 expression despite the competition of Arg972 IRS-1. When the IRS-1-associated PI3K activity and the need for wild type IRS-1 were significantly increased by hypoxia in cardiomyocytes, however, the competition of overexpressed Arg972 IRS-1 would manifest significant inhibitory effect on insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling and thereby ACE2 expression.

            "text": "There were several limitations of the present study: (1) The increased serum ACE2 levels in acute MI subjects could be from multiple sources such as vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes. We only used cardiomyocytes in vitro to identify the causal relationship between Arg972 IRS-1 and serum ACE2 levels in acute MI subjects. The increased level of secreted/soluble ACE2 in the culture media of cardiomyocytes under hypoxia did suggest that cardiomyocyte-secreted ACE2 could at least partially account for the increased serum ACE2 levels in acute MI patients. However, it would be interesting in future studies to explore the effects of insulin/IRS-1 signaling on ACE2 expression in other cell types. (2) There are many other pathophysiological factors involved in acute MI besides hypoxia. We only explored the effect of insulin/IRS-1 signaling on ACE2 expression under hypoxia and normoxia. It would be interesting to investigate how insulin/IRS-1 signaling regulates ACE2 expression under the influence of other conditions involved in acute MI (e.g. increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammatory responses, etc.). Nevertheless, based on in vivo and in vitro data, we have shown a potential causal relationship between Arg972 IRS-1 and serum ACE2 levels in acute MI patients. Our findings suggest that insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling exerts cardioprotective effects after acute MI at least partially through increased ACE2 expression; in agreement with this, Arg972 IRS-1 impairs insulin/IRS-1 signaling and results in decreased ACE2 expression after acute MI, which leads to more severe MI. Thus, insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling and ACE2 could be potential new targets for acute MI therapy. In addition, our study suggest that special attention should be paid to acute MI patients carrying Arg972 IRS-1, for they tend to have more severe MI and poorer prognosis than those carrying wild type IRS-1.",

Our in vitro data also indicate that insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling is required for ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes, and that hypoxia can markedly enhance the induction effect of insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling on ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes. This study provides the first evidence of crosstalk between insulin/IRS-1/PI3K signaling and RAS after acute MI, thereby adding fresh insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of acute MI.",
