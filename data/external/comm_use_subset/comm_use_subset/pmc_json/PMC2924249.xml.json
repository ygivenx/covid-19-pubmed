            "text": "During recent years it has become clear that disease spreading [1]\u2013[3] transcends geography: the contact process is no longer restricted to the immediate geographical neighbors, but exhibits the stereotypical small-world phenomenon with inescapable impact [4]\u2013[7]. The SARS and, at the time of writing, the influenza A outbreaks provide arresting examples of this effect in a biological context, although the spread of computer viruses constitutes perhaps the most obvious manifestation of such a property. Recent advances in the science of networks [2] also brought the impact of disease interactions beyond geography to the spotlight, providing compelling evidence of the role that the networks of contacts between individuals or computers play in the dynamics of infectious diseases [3], [5]. In the majority of cases in which complex networks of disease spreading have been considered [7], they were taken to be static entities. However, social networks are intrinsically dynamical entities. In fact, modern societies have developed rapid means of information dissemination, both at local and at centralized levels, which one naturally expects to alter individuals' response to vaccination policies, their behavior with respect to other individuals and their perception of likelihood and risk of infection [8]. In some cases one may even witness the adoption of centralized measures, such as travel restrictions [9], [10] or the imposition of quarantine spanning parts of the population [11], which may induce abrupt dynamical features onto the structure of the contact network. Furthermore, individual knowledge (based on local information) about the health status of acquaintances, partners, relatives, etc., combined with individual preventive strategies [12]\u2013[20] such as condoms, vaccination, the use of face masks or prophylactic drugs, avoidance of visiting specific web-pages, staying away from public places, etc., may also lead to bias in the organization of disease paths along dynamical networks.",

            "text": "As a result, quite a few studies have recently investigated the impact of dynamical networks on disease progression, as well as the influence of the way information (disease awareness) flows in parallel with disease progression and the role of noise in disease dynamics [21]\u2013[33]. At par with these models, our model studies disease dynamics in a finite and constant population of individuals. Contrary to current models though (see Discussion Section for more details), our dynamical contact structure allows for a variable number of overall links between individuals, which in turn depends on the overall incidence of disease in the population. This increased complexity of the model, however, will allow us to describe analytically disease dynamics in finite populations. Infection occurs along the links of a contact network whose structure may change based on each individual's health status and the availability of information regarding the health status of others. We assume the existence of some form of (unsupervised) local information about the health status of social contacts, depending on which individuals may be more or less effective in avoiding contact with those infected while remaining in touch with the healthy. We investigate some of the most widely used models of disease spreading, such as the popular Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model [1], [3], the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model [1] used to study, e.g., AIDS\n[1], [34], and the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model [1], [35], more appropriate to model, for instance, single season flu outbreaks [1] or computer virus spreading [5]. We provide analytical results which show that, on finite adaptive networks, the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on i) the size of the population, ii) the number of infected and ultimately iii) on the efficiency of local information spreading. These results, obtained under the assumption that network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading, are shown (numerically) to remain valid for a much wider range of time scales. When combined with the analytical results already known for static networks [3], which describe well the opposite limit in which the network dynamics is slow compared to disease dynamics, we demonstrate that one can describe analytically most of the time scale spectra. We further show how availability of information may either drastically reduce the time required to eradicate a disease (when recovery from the disease is possible), or drastically increase the time after which the entire population becomes infected (when the disease cannot be cured). Finally, we discuss the implications of assuming that individuals exhibit diverse response profiles to available information [36]\u2013[38].",

Individuals occupy the nodes of a graph, whereas the links of the graph define who interacts with whom. As usual, we define a transmission probability \u03bb and a recovery probability \u03b4. We assume a population of finite and constant size N, but with variable number of links [39], [40]. Links are established and removed at rates which also depend on the health status of the individuals connected: Links of different types \u2014 SS, SI and II \u2014 will tend to last differently. The SIR model, on the other hand, requires the introduction of a new epidemiological state \u2014 Recovered (or Removed, R) \u2014 representing individuals who, once recovered from the infection, acquire immunity. In SIR, the same parameters \u03bb and \u03b4 defined above remain finite, but now we have three new kinds of links \u2014 SR, RI and RR. Finally, the SI model can be viewed as the limit of the SIS model when , representing diseases from which recovery is impossible.",

For simplicity, we assume that new links are established and removed randomly, a feature which may not always apply in real cases, where the limited social horizon of individuals or the nature of their social ties may constrain part of their neighborhood structure (see Discussion). Let us further assume that links may be broken off at different rates, based on the nature of the links and the information available about the neighbors: Let us denote these rates by bpq for links of type pq (). This allows us to write down a system of ordinary differential equations [39], [40] for the time evolution of the number of links of each type. These and all other technical details of the model are presented in the Methods section. In the steady state of the linking dynamics, the number of links of each type is given by , where  are the fractions of active pq-links, compared to the maximum possible number of links , for a given number of S, I and R. In the absence of disease only SS links exist, and hence  determines the average connectivity of the network under disease free conditions, characterizing the type of the population under study. In the presence of I individuals, to the extent that S individuals manage to avoid contact with I, they succeed in escaping infection. Hence, the intuition is clear: Reshaping of the contact network based on available information of the health status of individuals will contribute to inhibit disease progression. In the extreme limit of perfect information and individual capacity to immediately break up contacts with infected, we are isolating all infected, thus containing disease progression. Our goal here, however, is to understand how and in which way partial individual information affects the overall disease dynamics.",

In the present study, we assume that individuals are not centrally supervised or informed: Individual decision is based on available local information about the health state of one's contacts. To the extent that such information spreads quickly and contacts are not too frequent, one can study analytically the limit in which the network dynamics \u2014 resulting from adaptation to the flow of local information \u2014 is much faster than disease dynamics. In this case, one may separate the time scales between network adaptation and contact (disease) dynamics: The network has time to reach a steady state before the next contact takes place. Consequently, the probability of having an infected neighbor is modified by a neighborhood structure which will change in time depending on the impact of the disease in the population and the overall efficiency of local information flow. It will be shown that a quickly adapting community induces profound changes in the dynamics of disease spreading, irrespective of the underlying epidemic model. Furthermore, we will demonstrate numerically that the two limiting cases amenable to analytic treatment \u2014 static networks on the one hand, and quickly adapting networks on the other hand \u2014 remain valid for a wide range of intermediate time scales, strengthening the power of the analytical predictions derived here.",

Therefore, we consider one particular rate bI for links involving infected individuals (), and another one, bH, for links connecting healthy individuals (). In general, one expects bI to be maximal when each individual has perfect information about the state of her neighbors and to be (minimal and) equal to bH when no information is available, turning the ratio between these two rates into a quantitative measure of the amount of information available or the efficiency of information use. Note that we reduce the model to two break-up rates in order to facilitate the discussion of the results. The general principles and conclusions remain valid when all break-up rates are incorporated explicitly. It is worth noticing that three out of these six rates are of particular importance for the overall disease dynamics: bSS, bSR and bSI. These three rates, combined with the rate c of creating new links, define the fraction of active SS, SR and SI links, and subsequent correlations between individuals [44], and therefore determine the probability for a susceptible to become infected (see Methods). This probability will increase when considering higher values of c (assuming bI>bH). In other words, when individuals create new links more often, therefore increasing the likelihood of establishing connections to infected individuals (when present), they need to be better informed about the health state of their contacts in order to escape infection. In the fast linking limit, the other three break-up rates (bII, bIR and bRR) influence disease progression since they contribute to altering the average degree of the network.",

Strictly speaking, a dynamical network does not change the disease dynamics at the local level, meaning that infected individuals pass the disease to their neighbors with probability intrinsic to the disease itself. At the population level, on the other hand, disease progression proceeds as if the infectiousness of the disease effectively changes, as a result of the network dynamics. Hence, analyzing an adaptive network scenario at a population level can be achieved via a correction on the transmission probability, keeping the mathematically more attractive well-mixed scenario. In this sense, from a well-mixed perspective, dynamical networks contribute to change the effective infectiousness of the disease, which becomes frequency and information dependent.",

This may not always be the case, and hence it is important to assess the domain of validity of this limit. In the following, we discuss the particular case of the SIS model. An analogous study for both SIR and SI yields qualitatively similar results, as discussed in the Text S1. Figure 3 shows the average  of the quasi-stationary distributions (circles) obtained via computer simulations (see Methods for details) as a function of the relative time scale  of network update (taking as unit time scale that associated with disease dynamics). Whenever , we can characterize the disease dynamics analytically, assuming a well-mixed population (complete graph), whereas for  we recover the analytical results obtained in the fast linking limit. At intermediate time scales, Figure 3 shows that as long as  is smaller than 10, network dynamics contributes to inhibit disease spreading by effectively increasing the critical spreading rate. Overall, the validity of the time scale separation extends well beyond the limits one might anticipate based solely on the time separation ansatz. As long as the time scale for network update is smaller than the one for disease spreading (), the analytical prediction for the limit , indicated by the lower dashed line in Figure 3, remains valid. The analytical result in the extreme opposite limit (), indicated by the upper dashed line in Figure 3, holds as long as . Moreover, it is noteworthy that the network dynamics influences the disease dynamics both by reducing the frequency of interactions between susceptible and infected, but also by reducing the average degree of the network. These complementary effects are disentangled for intermediate regimes, in which the network dynamics is too slow to warrant sustained protection of susceptible individuals from contacts with infected, despite managing to reduce the average degree (shown by crosses). In fact, for  the disease dynamics is mostly controlled by the average degree, as shown by the solid lines in Figure 3. Here, the average stationary distribution was determined by replacing, in the analytic expression for static networks,  by the time-dependent average connectivity  computed numerically.",

Unlike most of these studies, however, we do not impose any local or global linking constraints, meaning that individuals can create (or remove) a link without the need for removing (or creating) another one \u2013 in other words, the number of links will change in time, also adapting to the disease configuration of the population. Consequently, the average degree of the network results from the self-organization of the network structure, and co-evolves with the disease dynamics (cf. networks evolving towards critical values of connectivity, as studied in [45]). A population suffering from high disease prevalence where individuals avoid contact in order to escape infection will therefore exhibit a lower average degree than a population with hardly any infected individuals. Such a frequency-dependent average degree prevents also that containment of infected individuals would result automatically in the formation of a dense healthy cluster, which is extremely vulnerable to future infection, as reported before in [21], [25], [26].",

This approach allows for a direct comparison between analytical predictions and individual-based computer simulations, and for a detailed analysis of finite-size effects and convergence times, whose exponential growth will signal possible bistable disease scenarios. In such a framework, we were able to show that adaptive networks in which individuals may be informed about the health status of others lead to a disease whose effective infectiousness depends on the overall number of infected in the population. In other words, disease propagation on adaptive networks can be seen as mathematically equivalent to disease spreading on a well-mixed population, but with a rescaled effective infectiousness. In accord with the intuition advanced in the introduction, as long as individuals react promptly and consistently to accurate available information on whether their acquaintances are infected or not, network dynamics effectively weakens the disease burden the population suffers from. Last but not least, if disease recovery is possible, the time for disease eradication drastically reduces whenever individuals have access to accurate information about the health state of their acquaintances and use it to avoid contact with those infected. If recovery or immunity is impossible, the average time needed for a disease to spread increases significantly when such information is being used. In both cases, our model clearly shows how availability of information hinders disease progression (by means of quick action on infected, e.g., their containment via link removal), which constitutes a crucial factor to control the development of global pandemics.",

            "text": "Finally, it is also worth mentioning that the knowledge about the health state of the others may not always be accurate or available in time. This is for instance the case for diseases where recently infected individuals remain asymptomatic for a substantial period. The longer the incubation period associated with the disease, the less successful individuals will be in escaping infection, which reduces in our model to a lower effective rate of breaking SI links, with the above mentioned consequences. Moreover, the (social) network through which awareness of the health status of others proceeds may lead to different rates of information spread. In such cases, one may model explicitly the spread of the health state of each individual, as done in Refs. [28], [32], and study the interplay between disease expansion and individuals' awareness of the disease. Of course, depending on the particular disease at hand and the contact network along which it propagates, one may have to take other factors into account, besides network adaptability, in order to make accurate predictions of disease progression. Creation and destruction of links may for instance not always occur randomly, as we assumed here, but in a way that is biased by a variety of factors such as social and genetic distance, geographical proximity, family ties, etc. The resulting contact network may therefore become organized in a specific way, promoting the formation of particular structures, such as networks characterized by long-tailed degree distributions or with strong topological correlations among nodes [2], [46]\u2013[48] which, in turn, may influence the disease dynamics. The impact of combining such effects, resulting from specific disease scenarios, with those reported here will depend on their prevalence. A small fraction of non-random links, or of ties which cannot be broken, will likely induce small modifications on the average connectivity of the contact network, which can be incorporated in our analytic expressions without compromising their validity regarding population wide dynamics. On the other hand, when the contact network is highly heterogeneous (e.g., exhibiting pervasive long-tail degree distributions), non-random events may have very distinct effects, from being almost irrelevant (and hence can be ignored) to inducing hierarchical cascades of infection [49], in which case our results will not apply.",
