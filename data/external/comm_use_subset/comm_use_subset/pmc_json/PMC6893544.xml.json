Here, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent and is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus which belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae [2]. The size of the IBV genome is approximately 27.6 kilo-bases (kb) and the genome encodes at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs), flanked by two untranslated regions (UTR), and is organized as follows: 5\u2032 (UTR)-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-envelope (E)-M-5a-5b-nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032 UTR [3]. Ribosomal frameshifting from the 1a reading frame into the 1ab ORF at the 5\u2032 region generates two polyproteins (1a and 1ab) which are then cleaved by two types of virus-encoded proteases. The process generates 15 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsps 2-16, that are necessary for replication and pathogenicity [3,4]. The remaining 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes structural components, including S, M, E, and N proteins, as well as small non-structural accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b) with unclear functions [5].",

It is possible that the recombination events occur at multiple sites of the IBV genome, leading to rapid viral evolution [9,10,11,12]. For example, a recombination event that involved the 5\u2032 terminal end of the S1 gene containing hypervariable regions I and II has driven an IBV isolate of 4/91 genotype to be more serologically related with H120 strain [13]. Further, it has been suggested that the acquisition of the 3\u2032 end of the N gene and the 3\u2032 UTR from a strain of different genotype, through recombination, may alter the replication efficiency of an IBV isolate [14].",

In a study that examined a highly variable region within the IBV genome, namely, the S1 gene, even 10 passages in embryonated eggs resulted in no changes in five viruses. Additionally, two viruses had only 2 nucleotide changes and one virus had only 1 nucleotide change [33]. The genome organization of our five IBV isolates (5\u2032-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032) is consistent with many of the recently reported IBV genomes in different locations around the world [34,35,36,37]. We reported a 13-nucleotide deletion in the reading frame of the 6b gene in isolate IBV/Ck/Can/18-048192T. The examination of the raw sequencing data verified the deletions. Natural IBV isolates lacking accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 5a or 5b), or those expressing a truncated 3a protein, have been reported, and the absence of such accessory proteins did not abolish the replication of these viruses [38,39]. Although the roles of these accessory genes are not fully studied, recombinant IBVs with 3 and/or 5 deleted genes exhibited reduced virulence and induced protective immune responses [40]. Similarly, the ORF 4a protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus affected interferon therapy response [41] and the overexpression of ORF 6 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus induced cell apoptosis [42]. It is possible that these proteins may have analogous roles in IBVs, although further studies are necessary to confirm this possibility.",

            "text": "The S1 gene is the most variable region within the genome and encodes virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes. Therefore, it is used often for phylogenetic analysis [43]. Classification of IBV into lineages or genotypes relying on the full S1 gene has been proposed [7], and by using this method, our five IBV isolates were clustered within the GI-17 genotype, where they were highly related to MDL_DMV1639. On the other hand, the Mass and Conn types that are used in live IBV vaccines in Canada showed low similarities with our five IBV isolates, which may explain the increase in the isolation rate of DMV/1639-like isolates from poultry farms in Canada [15]. However, vaccine efficacy studies against DMV/1639-like isolates circulating in Canada are required. The occurrence of IBV strains in Canada that are closely related to IBV strains in USA may be explained by the potential role of wild birds in virus transmission across the border [44]. A substantial portion of diagnostic samples (20.5%) genotyped by the Animal Health Laboratory (University of Guelph, ON, Canada) in the early 2000s were US variant-like viruses [18], which also indicates the possibility IBV transmission between the two neighboring countries. It is also possible that the current IBV isolates in Canada originated from a native parental IBV strain, and studies should be directed towards the confirmation of the origin of the current IBV strains. It was suggested that the IBV strain DMV/1639 evolved from a strain of PA/171/99 which was detected in early 1999 in Pennsylvania, where the two isolates shared a 95.6% S1 nucleotide sequence identity [32,45].",

            "text": "In general, recombination events that contribute to the genetic diversity of coronaviruses is believed to result from a template-switching copy-choice mechanism during RNA replication [46]. The Conn vaccine, Cal56b, and IBS037A/2017 strains showed high sequence identity with our five IBV isolates. However, strains Cal56b and IBS037A/2017 were isolated in the USA and Malaysia, respectively, and they have never been isolated in Canada [47,48]. Since the complete genome sequences of our five IBV isolates were 99.4\u2013100% identical, the SimPlot analysis results were identical. Analysis of the recombination events in our five IBV isolates showed that genetic fragments from the Conn vaccine strain could be detected in our five IBV isolates. Live attenuated Conn vaccines are used in the poultry industry, since this is one of the two live attenuated vaccines available in Canada. Our recombination analysis also indicated that the 4/91 vaccine-like virus is a potential parent of our five IBV isolates. Unlike live attenuated Conn vaccines, modified live vaccines based on the 4/91 strain are not licensed in Canada. The incursion of the IBV 4/91 strain in Canadian poultry started in late 2011 [18]. Unfortunately, there were no recent complete genome sequences available to include in our analysis in this instance. It is noteworthy that seven S1 sequences of 4/91 viruses identified in 2011 were 99.2\u2013100% identical amongst themselves and 99.2\u201399.6% identical to the IBV 4/91 vaccine strain [18]. It is possible that a large segment of such 4/91 viruses contributed in the replicase gene and 5\u2032 UTR of our five IBV isolates. Four out of five recombination events demonstrated in this study were in the first two thirds of the genome. Consistently, regions with the highest incidence of recombination were located in the replicase transcriptase complex [34,49,50,51]. We developed a hypothesis to explain the scenario of the origin of the fragment that involved the S gene, which states that a recombination event replaced this fragment in a Conn vaccine-like virus with a fragment from an as-yet-unidentified parental virus, which has led to the emergence of these variants which include the PA/171/99 and DMV/1639 strains in the USA. Subsequently, when these isolates started to circulate in Canadian poultry, recombination events that involved 4/91 vaccine-like viruses may have happened. The results obtained from the multiple sequence alignments of our five IBV isolates and isolate GA9977/2019 with the Conn vaccine and 4/91 vaccine strains support this hypothesis, however, it cannot be confirmed, since there were no complete genome sequences available for both the PA/171/99 and DMV/1639 strains immediately after they had been isolated.",
