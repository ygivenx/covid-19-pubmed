This growth in zoonotic disease research is partly driven by the local and global recognition of the threats from zoonotic diseases and efforts to implement one health approaches in combating the public health and economic threats posed by these diseases. For example, Kenya established a One Health office referred to as the Zoonotic disease unit and one of its mandates is to stimulate and conduct research and training at the human-animal-ecosystem interfaces [15]. Most of the countries involved in this review including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia have established similar One Health offices or have organizations and networks created to conduct One Health training, research and outreach [16]. Publication output of countries has been associated with the level of national research spending and English proficiency [17]. These factors could be at play in East Africa region as well, with notable increase in the number of Universities established in the last 20 years [18]. The relatively fewer publications coming from Rwanda and Burundi may be associated with the two countries being French speaking, or political instability during the study period covered in our review.",

Longitudinal studies, although more expensive and taking longer to conduct, allow for estimation of incidence rates, inference of causation and understanding transmission dynamics of infectious diseases [26]. Although both endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases have been associated with large public health and economic losses [3, 4, 27, 28], only a small proportion of the studies from the region have focused on socio-economics. Experiences from recent outbreak in zoonotic diseases in Africa revealed the need for studies that advance disease detection, diagnosis, predicting risk, understanding disease transmission dynamics, pathogen phylogenetics and phylogeography, and inform likely outcomes of available interventions including social and economic factors [20, 29\u201333].",

It is not clear why such a situation exists but it may be related to researchers\u2019 only being keen to obtain an academic qualification or lack of proper academic support towards peer review publication.
