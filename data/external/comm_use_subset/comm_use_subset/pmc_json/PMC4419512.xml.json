These glycoproteins are the most prominent features of the viral surface that can be recognized within the host cellular background and are targeted for antibody neutralization. Consequently, viruses have evolved a number of strategies for shielding the spike structures formed by their surface glycoproteins. These strategies include restriction of access to conserved structural features through conformational occlusion and oligomerization [2,3], sequence hyper-variability, especially within loops that mask conserved epitopes [4], and extensive posttranslational glycosylation [5].",

This glycan armor hides the underlying protein structures on one face of gp120, whereas the epitopes on the other face of gp120 are masked by the quaternary structure of the trimeric spike [7]. The effectiveness of glycans in this defensive mechanism may in part hinge on the generally weak interactions between proteins and carbohydrates [8]. The glycan modifications of HIV Env are also essential for its folding and function [9,10]. Evolution of mutations in the position and frequency of N-linked glycans on the HIV spike is a contributing factor to viral escape during the course of infection and appears to occur within limits affected by immune evasion, efficient processing, and access to receptor binding sites [11]. Logically, mu that would reduce the glycosylation levels of HIV Env could affect viral processing and maturation, leading to attenuated infectivity, as well as further exposing the virus to the immune system. Therefore, targeting this viral glycan shield may be an effective way of combating HIV infection.",

            "text": "Lectins are small proteins that have evolved to bind carbohydrates with high affinity and specificity. A number of lectins have been shown to display potent antiviral activity [12]. Currently, the most potent reported anti-HIV lectin is griffithsin (GRFT), an obligate domain-swapped dimer in which each domain has jacalin-like fold (Figure 1A) [13]. GRFT has anti-HIV EC50 of ~50 pM in cell-based assays [14] and exhibits synergistic effects against HIV in combination with other antiviral agents [15-17]. Additionally, GRFT has been reported to exhibit antiviral activity against the coronavirus responsible for SARS [18,19], the hepatitis C virus [20], the Japanese encephalitis virus [21], and the murine herpes simplex virus type 2 [22]. There are a number of characteristics that make GRFT an attractive candidate for development as an antiviral therapeutic. GRFT is thermostable, can survive in a wide range of conditions including those found in the macaque vaginal environment, and exhibits little or no toxicity and immunogenicity [23]. Subcutaneous administration of GRFT in rodent models has also shown that this lectin accumulates to therapeutically effective levels in serum and plasma with minimal toxicity [24]. Finally, low-cost, large-scale production of GRFT in genetically modified tobacco plants has been demonstrated [25].",

            "text": "We have previously determined the structures of unliganded, native GRFT (Figure 1A) and its complexes with a number of mono- and disaccharides [26-28]. In its native form GRFT is a rigid domain-swapped homodimer. We also engineered several monomeric forms of GRFT (mGRFT) (Figure 1B) and determined their structures, including the structure of a complex with nonamannoside, an analogue of Man9 that forms a common glycosylation pattern found on HIV surface glycoproteins [29]. The anti-HIV activity of mGRFT was approximately 1000-fold lower than that of GRFT, although both the monomeric and dimeric forms of this lectin have very similar oligosaccharide-binding affinities. Therefore, we suggested that the presence of two binding domains in native, dimeric GRFT was important for its activity by allowing the cross-linking of gp120-associated oligosaccharides. Such a mechanism could also lead to the agglutination of HIV virions [30]. We hypothesized that providing more flexibility and varying the distance between the two domains might improve antiviral properties of the derivatives of GRFT. Here we describe the design and characterization of four new lectins constructed from two, three, and four tandem repeats of mGRFT (mGRFT tandemers), which allow for variation in the distance between the carbohydrate binding domains and provide significant freedom to their orientation angle. These novel mGRFT tandemers displayed potent anti-HIV activity down to a level of 1.0 pM and were able to do so without engendering viral aggregation.",

All further references to mGRFT in this work are to 1GS-S. Schematic models of mGRFT tandemers constructed based on the structure of mGRFT [30] are depicted in Figure 2. The linker between each mGRFT domain was chosen to be flexible and unstructured and consisted of single and triple repeats of Gly-Thr-Gly. However, the flexibility of the linker rendered all attempts at crystallizing the tandemers unsuccessful. Purification of tandemers was performed largely as described previously [30]. The relevant information for GRFT, mGRFT, and the tandemers is listed in Table 1. The relative thermal stability of the mGRFT tandemers was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (Additional file 1: Table S1). It was found that the mGRFT tandemers have similar melting temperatures to mGRFT, indicating that the lectin domains were properly folded.",

The results (Table 1) showed that, as reported previously, mGRFT was significantly weaker than GRFT, with an EC50 value of 119.3 nM. For the mGRFT tandemers, 2mGRFT (EC50 = 2.7 pM) and 2mGRFT3 (EC50 = 2.6 pM) were 5-fold more active than GRFT (EC50 = 13.8 pM).

However, no further enhancement of antiviral activity was observed for constructs with additional mGRFT domains, since the anti-HIV activity of 4mGRFT (EC50 = 1.2 pM) was similar to 3mGRFT. The similar anti-HIV activity of 2mGRFT and 2mGRFT3 indicated that the longer interdomain linker did not affect the potency of the tandemers.

The gp120 binding of 2mGRFT, 2mGRFT3, and 3mGRFT was fully characterized and the thermodynamic parameters of the interactions are detailed in Table 3. Binding of gp120 to the mGRFT tandemers was revealed to be exothermic in nature.

As reported previously for the binding between GRFT and high-mannose oligosacharides [30], an enthalpy-entropy compensation was apparent, indicating that the favorable binding contacts between GRFT and gp120 had overcome the unfavorable conformational penalties of the bound partners and the unfavorable entropy of water (negative T\u2206S values; Table 3) at the interface and around the bound complex, resulting in energetically-favored binding with gp120 (negative \u2206G values; Table 3).",

The enthalpy/entropy compensation (\u0394H/\u0394S) ratio for 2mGRFT3 was 1.33, compared to 1.16 and 1.19 for 2mGRFT and 3mGRFT, respectively (Table 3). As with any tethered constructs, the crosslinking interactions with gp120 and formation of water filled aggregates would be entropically disfavored, primarily due to the decreased entropy of the \u201ccaged\u201d water molecules within the crosslinked complexes [31]. It was clear from the enthalpy-entropy compensation that the mGRFT tandemers either did not form large aggregates with gp120, or if they did, the crosslinked complexes were soluble and flexible enough to prevent any great degree of trapping of the solvent water molecules. The gp120 titrated solutions of the mGRFT tandemers were far less cloudy than the post-titration solution of GRFT, suggesting that little or no crosslinked aggregation had taken place. In particular, solution of the 2mGRFT3 complex with gp120 was essentially clear.",

To determine if this was true and to evaluate the role that the enhanced flexibility in binding domains may play in this phenomenon, we used dynamic light scattering to measure the aggregation of HIV-1BAL virions after treatment with mGRFT, GRFT, or one of the four GRFT tandemers. As shown in Figure 4, GRFT did aggregate HIV-1BAL virions to a significant extent when compared to untreated virions.

Viruses exposed to mGRFT displayed an additional density on the spike that was irregular in both shape and the degree of enlargement. The effect of GRFT on HIV-1 differed dramatically from that of mGRFT. Virions treated with GRFT formed large aggregates having lateral dimensions on the micrometer scale (Figure 5G). These aggregates appear in the micrograph as large electron-dense swathes. Individual virions could be identified at the periphery of the aggregates, and though they seem to maintain their membrane integrity, their shapes were highly distorted. Tomography revealed dense masses of protein at the interfaces between virions (Figures 5H and I), which consistently co-localized to the interface between neighboring virions. The mGRFT tandemers displayed mutually similar effects on HIV-1 virions and envelope glycoproteins (Figures 5J, K, I, and M, respectively), but differed significantly from virions treated with GRFT. Tomographic imaging showed that virions treated with the mGRFT tandemers remained monodisperse, similar to the results with mGRFT and dissimilar from GRFT.",

The first 15 residues of each monomer form a strand-loop-strand structure that completes the \u03b2-prism-II fold of the opposite monomer. Each \u03b2-prism harbors three carbohydrate-binding sites on one of the terminal facets of the prism. The centers of the carbohydrate-binding sites form an equilateral triangle with 15 \u00c5 sides. The domains are oriented at a ~160\u00b0 angle from each other, with the centers of the triangular carbohydrate-binding surfaces positioned 50 \u00c5 apart (Figure 1A). The orientation of the domains is fixed, since the dimer is formed by domain swapping involving two \u03b2 strands, resulting in a rigid molecule [26-28] The three carbohydrate-binding sites on the surface of each domain act as a selective mechanism for specifically targeting high-mannose, branched carbohydrate environments typically found on viral envelope glycoproteins [40]. Viral glycoproteins present a preponderance of high mannose oligosaccharides when compared to human cellular glycoproteins, which have a larger proportion of sialylated oligosaccharides. Alignments of glycans identified on gp120 in vitro [6,41] with N-linked sequon variations of gp120 identified in silico suggests that high-mannose modifications dominate the conserved regions of gp120 [11].",

In native GRFT the distance between the centers of the carbohydrate-binding regions on each domain was ~50 \u00c5 (Figure 1A). Increasing the linear length of the mGRFT tandemers from ~70 \u00c5 (2mGRFT) to ~90 \u00c5 (2mGRFT3) resulted in a nearly identical or slightly worse anti-HIV activity overall, suggesting that this increase in potential distance between mGRFT domains was not a determining factor in anti-HIV potency. Increasing the number of mGRFT domains did enhance antiviral activity. However, this effect was limited to three mGRFT domains as evidenced from the nearly identical anti-HIV activities of 3mGRFT and 4mGRFT (Tables 1 and 2). The limit on the number of mGRFT domains was possibly due to geometric constraints that could limit access to glycan ligands by the fourth mGRFT domain of 4mGRFT and/or saturation of local viral oligosaccharides with mGRFT domains.",

The dimeric structure of native GRFT enhanced its anti-HIV activity by orders of magnitude but also led to viral aggregation. While this aggregation is a possible contributing factor to the antiviral activity of native GRFT, the ability to cause aggregation is clearly not the determining factor for the anti-HIV activity of the mGRFT tandemers.

In the case of the mGRFT tandemers, after binding of the first mGRFT domain to an Env spike, the flexible linkers would allow the remaining mGRFT domains to more readily sample the local environment and bind to the nearest available carbohydrate ligand. The local concentration of ligands available for subsequent mGRFT domains is potentially higher on the same spike than in the overall solution. Therefore, the mGRFT tandemers, owing to the flexibility of their linkers, are more likely to bind glycans on the same virion, whereas native GRFT, due to its conformational rigidity, would more favor inter-virion cross-linking.",

The antiviral activity of GRFT, mGRFT, and the mGRFT tandemers stems from their selective binding to high mannose oligosaccharides on Env spikes. Natural mutations that removed glycosylation at positions Asn234 and Asn295 have been reported to impart resistance to GRFT [43]. In addition, Huang et al. showed that deglycosylation of gp120 at Asn295 or Asn448 also resulted in resistance to GRFT [44]. The location of these oligosaccharide attachment sites on gp120 are shown in Figure 6. To investigate the role of specific oligosaccharides in the sensitivity to GRFT tandemers, we utilized genetically-engineered pseudotype viruses including either HIV-1 clade B CAAN5342 gp120 (Figure 3A) or clade C CAP206.8 gp120 (Figure 3B) sequences. We tested both strains in either the presence or absence of oligosaccharide attachment sites at positions 234 N and 295 N of the gp120 protein. Figure 3 displays the results of our assessment of the activity of either wild-type GRFT, mGRFT, or mGRFT tandemers against these viruses. The 3mGRFT and 4mGRFT tandemers retain significantly more activity against wild-type GRFT-resistant viruses than the 2mGRFT, 2mGRFT3, or wild-type GRFT. We speculate that this increased activity against resistant viruses is due to the ability of these larger mGRFT tandemers to sample a broader range of oligosaccharides on gp120 than the smaller mGRFT tandemers or the conformationally-restricted wild-type GRFT.",

The arrangement of the griffithsin monomers in the mGRFT tandemers is such that they are able to bind carbohydrate moieties on the same virion, but not in a way that bridges separate virions, as demonstrated by the tomographic and light scattering experiments. Given the molecular dimensions of the mGRFT tandemers (<100 \u00c5 across), and the fact that neighboring spikes on the virus are spaced apart by significantly greater and variable distances (each trimeric Env itself is ~ 150 \u00c5 across), it follows that the multiple sites on the mGRFT tandemers are occupied by carbohydrates that are displayed within the same Env trimer, with a high likelihood of crosslinking across protomers within the trimer. Cryo-electron microscopic studies have shown that CD4-induced opening of the trimeric Env spike is necessary for exposure of gp41 that initiates the first step in the fusion of viral and target cell membranes [34,36,46]. The crosslinking of gp120 protomers may essentially block the opening of the trimeric spike and prevent exposure of gp41 and its fusogenic components required for viral entry, thus providing a likely mechanism for the potent function of GRFT and mGRFT tandemers as antiviral agents.",

The data presented here demonstrate the potential utility of mGRFT tandemers for the microbicide development, as well as highlight the complex spatial and orientation requirements for viral neutralization by carbohydrate-binding agents such as griffithsin. The 3mGRFTand 4mGRFT tandemers display some advantages over native GRFT (e.g. activity against GRFT-resistant viruses) but the addition of flexible linkers makes these constructs more susceptible to proteolytic degradation and less thermally stable. The advantages or disadvantages of the absence of viral aggregation by mGRFT tandemers, though perhaps responsible for their moderately improved in vitro activity, is of undetermined value in an in vivo setting. Further studies on the full physiological and immunological consequences of mGRFT tandemer administration will be necessary to fully evaluate the potential of these engineered lectins for microbicide development.",

The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole.

The pooled fractions containing tandemers were then dialyzed against pure deionized water, or against 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl. All purification procedures were performed at room temperature. As with the native GRFT, the GRFT tandemers were all stable to pH ranges from 1\u20138 and to both heat (up to 50\u00b0C) and organic solvents (i.e. alcohols, acetonitrile).",

Sample mixtures were prepared by adding 10 nm protein-A gold colloid (Cell Microscopy Center, Utrecht University, 3584 CH Utrecht, The Netherlands) to virus suspension, followed by addition of one of six griffithsin constructs and incubation at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. All GRFT constructs were added to the virion suspension at equimolar concentrations with respect to the griffithsin monomer. Two microliters of sample mixture were applied to plasma cleaned carbon-coated 200-mesh grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools, 07745 Jena, Germany) and immediately blotted and plunge frozen using a Mark III Vitrobot (FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124, USA) maintained at 25\u00b0C and 100% humidity. Data was collected on samples maintained at \u2212193\u00b0C using a Tecnai G2 Polara transmission electron microscopy (FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon 97124, USA) operated at 200 kV and equipped with an energy-filter and 2 K x 2 K post-energy filter CCD camera (Gatan Incorporated, Pleasanton, CA 94588, USA). Projections were acquired with a 10\u201320 e\u2212/\u00c52 dose at 4.5 kX magnification with \u221270 \u03bcm underfocus. Tilt series spanned an angular range of +/\u2212 65\u00b0 with 2\u00b0 tilt increments and were acquired at \u22122.5 \u03bcm underfocus with a per-tilt dose of 1 \u2013 2 e\u2212/\u00c52. Tilt series were aligned using RAPTOR as implemented in IMOD [49,50], and tomograms were reconstructed using R-weighted back projection as implemented in IMOD.",
