GPCRs are sensory proteins and important receivers of different external stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, odours and light. GPCRs represent the largest family of cell-surface receptor molecules that are involved in signal transmission, accounting for >2% of the cellular proteins encoded by the human genome and they are the targets for 50% of all recently launched drugs[3],[4]. GPCRs are characterized by the presence of highly conserved molecular architecture encoding seven transmembrane (TM) hydrophobic regions linked by three extracellular loops that alternate with three intracellular loops as confirmed by analysis of the crystal structure of rhodopsin[5]. The extracellular N-terminus is glycosylated, and the cytoplasmic C-terminus is generally phosphorylated. The GPCR family comprises the largest family of cell-surface receptors, which can sense information encoded by diverse external stimuli and translate the encoded information into readable signals for the cell[6].",

            "text": "EMR2 is an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor-2 precursor and a cell surface protein receptor (GPCR) restricted to leukocytes and/or smooth muscle cells in humans[7]. These receptors are characterized by an unique hybrid structure consisting of tandem repeats of EGF-like modules. It is coupled to the N-terminal family B (secretin receptor) GPCR related to the seven- transmembrane (TM7) receptor domains by a glycosylated stalk region[8],[9]. EGF-like module EMR2 receptors is predominately expressed in cells of the immune system and binds to ligands such as CD312. The EMR2 genes are predominantly expressed on dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages. The EGF-TM7 molecules belong to a large protein family known as the long N-terminal of group B transmemberane 7 (LNB-TM7) or B2 subgroup of class B GPCRs with large extracellular N-terminal domains[8]\u2013[9]. All LNB-TM7 receptors that possess large extracellular domains consisting of various protein modules are implicated in protein-protein interactions. Along with adhesion and signaling function, these molecules also participate in the interaction of the extracellular region with other cell surfaces or extracellular matrix proteins through the transmembrane domain[10]. LNB-TM7 receptors have different extracellular structural domains that are separated from the TM7 region by an extended spacer region. A subgroup of the LNB-TM7 receptors is the EGF-TM7 family[11]. Genomic mapping analysis has suggested a possible EGF-TM7 gene family on the human chromosome 19p13.1 region and possesses similar exon-intron organizations[11] or the LNB-TM7 receptors[8] that contain a large N-terminal cell adhesion-like extracellular domain coupled to a secretin receptor-like TM7 domain.",

As a result of alternate RNA splicing, receptor isoforms possessing variable numbers of EGF domains are expressed. The EGF domains of EGF-TM7 receptors have been shown to mediate binding to cellular ligands. The domain 4 of EMR2 interacts with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and chondroitin sulfate[7]. Ligand specificity for chondroitin sulfate is shared by EMR2, whose EGF domain region is highly similar to that of CD97. Only 6 out of 236 amino acids differ within the five EGF domains[9]. To date, four isoforms have been reported for EMR2, containing two (EGF1, 2), three (EGF1, 2, 5), four (EGF1, 2, 3, 5), or five (EGF1, 2, 3, 4, 5) EGF domains. Antibody-blocking studies subsequently revealed that the fourth domain of EGF-like module constitutes the major ligand-binding site[7]. The ligand for the largest isoform of EMR2 has recently been identified as chrondroitin sulphate, which binds to the EGF-like module of EMR2. It has been shown to interact with chondroitin sulfate and GAG in an isoform-specific manner[10].",

            "text": "EMR2 is a myeloid cell-restricted member of the EGF-TM7 family that is closely related to CD97[8]\u2013[9]. The EGF-like domains of the full-length EMR2 protein share 97.5% sequence identity with CD97. Similar to CD97, distinct EMR2 protein isoforms consisting of different numbers of the EGF-like domains have been documented[9]. Tissue specificity of EMR2 expression is highest in peripheral blood leukocytes, followed by spleen and lymph nodes, with intermediate to low levels in the thymus, bone marrow, fetal liver, placenta and lung. The extracellular domain of EGF-TM7 receptor consists of tandem repeats of EGF-like modules followed by a Ser/Thr-rich stalk and a GPS motif[8]. The GPS motif is primarily found in members of class B2 GPCRs. These include the human polycystic kidney disease protein (PKD)-1[12]\u2013[13], suREJ3, a channel-like 11-span transmembrane protein[14] and hPKDREJ, the human homologue of suREJ3[15], suggesting that the GPS motif and its associated proteolytic cleavage activity are widely used by cell surface receptors. Although the functional significance of the GPS motif-associated proteolysis remains elusive, the presence of the highly conserved GPS motif in such a diverse array of receptors is suggestive of a common role in receptor function or regulation.",

This server is a part of the Elastic Network Model, which provides a fast simple tool to compute, visualize and analyze low-frequency normal modes of biological macromolecules. The structural model of EMR2 in dot pdb (.pdb) format was submitted for normal mode analysis while another 3-D structure complex was submitted as a reference of the desired conformational change. The key parameters which were used in computation included: DQMIN=-100, DQMAX=100, DQSTEP=20, and NRBL = \u201cauto\u201d. A total of 100 normal modes with the lowest frequencies were requested. The normal mode theory is based on the harmonic approximation of the potential energy function around a minimum energy conformation. This approximation allows an analytical solution of the motion by diagonalizing the Hessian matrix. Hessian matrices are used in large-scale optimization problems within Newton-type methods because they are the coefficient of the quadratic term of a local Taylor expansion of a function. That is:  where J is the Jacobian matrix, which is a vector (the gradient) for scalar-valued functions. The full Hessian matrix can be difficult to compute in practice; in such situations, quasi-Newton algorithms have been developed that use approximations to the Hessian. The most well-known quasi-Newton algorithm is the BFGS algorithm[39],[40].",

Various posttranslational modification sites have been identified in the EGF-like module protein EMR2 (Fig. 3). A signal peptide is found in the first twenty amino acids (amino acid sequence: MGGRVFLVFLAFCVWLTLPG) in EMR2 as predicted from SOSUI signal server. In the 2nd and 3rd domains, EGF has posttranslational ASX hydroxylation at the conserved aspartate or asparagine residues, forming erythro-\u03b2-hydroxyaspartic acid or erythro-\u03b2-hydroxyasparagine. In the fifth domain, APCC-binding destruction motifs are present. The BRCT domain of the fourth domain is associated with DNA damage response and recognizes and binds to specific phosphorylated serine sequences. PCSK cleavage site motif is present in the fifth domain of EMR2. A cyclin recognition motif that interacts with cyclin has also been detected in domain 5. FHA phosphopeptide ligand motif 1 is present in domain 5, and motif 2 is present in domain 1, 4 and 5. The FHA domain is a signal transduction module, which recognizes phosphothreonine-containing peptides on the ligand proteins. In domain 1, 4 and 5, ww ligand motifs are predicted that are implicated in protein-protein interactions mediated by WW domains. Casein kinase (CK1) phosphorylation motifs (recognized by CK1 and CK2 for Ser/Thr phosphorylation) are present in domain 1, 4 and 5. In domain 1, 4 and 5, GSK3 phosphorylation site is present and in domain 5, and 16 different patterns of this motif are present and shown in Fig. 3. GSK3 comprised of two highly related proteins (GSK3-\u03b1 and GSK3-\u03b2) phosphorylates a wide variety of target proteins. N-glycosylation, a posttranslational process involving the transfer of an oligosaccharide chain to asparagine residue in the protein, is found in domain 1, 4 and 5. MAPK phosphorylation, which pro-directs kinases such as P38 MAP kinase to phosphorylate Ser/Thr in various signal transduction pathways. Domain 4 and 5 contain the phosphorylation motifs of phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase related kinases (PI3KKs), which are atypical protein kinases exclusive to eukaryotes.",

EMR2 does not interact with the ligand decay accelerating factor (CD55) for complement, unlike the related CD97 antigen, and indicates that these very closely related proteins likely have non-redundant functions. The EMR2 gene produces multiple transcripts encoding distinct isoforms[9]. The chondroitin chains are present near the junctions between both of the NH2 and COOH-terminal globular domains and the central region[44]. In addition, only one potential N-glycosylation site in EMR2 is present in these regions. A modeled 3-D structure of the fourth domain of EMR2 was docked with a single strand of chondroitin 4-sulphate where the molecular mass is 17 kDa. The 3-D structure of chondroitin 4- sulphate was drawn in Chemsketch as *.mol file and converted into *.pdb format. The structure also identifies the specific interaction sites between EMR2 and C4-S molecule.
