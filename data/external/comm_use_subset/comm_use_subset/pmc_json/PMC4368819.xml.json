Important advances have been made in diverse aspects of leptospirosis including the differential host responses to leptospiral infection [4\u20139]. Despite these advances, mechanistic details by which end organ damage develops in some individuals but not in others remain to be elucidated. Further, factors that govern host susceptibility to leptospiral infection are not well understood. A recent study by our collaborative group found that approximately 6% of randomly sampled individuals in a highly endemic rural Amazonian village were chronically colonized by Leptospira without any recent clinical evidence of infection [10]. Although renal colonization by leptospires may occur in humans without serological or clinical evidence of infection, the clinical relevance and functional consequences of leptospiral colonization in humans remain to be characterized. New, less invasive, less expensive and more practical tools (compared to kidney biopsy) are needed to study pathologic changes in the kidney in order to understand clinically relevant sequelae of infection. In this report, we use proteomic analysis of urine exosomes in a rat chronic colonization model as a non-invasive window to kidney function in asymptomatic leptospiral infection.",

Characterization of exosomes from different biological samples has shown the presence of common as well as cell-type specific proteins. The protein content of exosomes has been shown to be modified under pathological or stress conditions [12\u201314]. Since exosome contents are specifically derived from cellular components, here we tested the hypothesis that urinary exosome protein content from a rat infected with Leptospira would be different from that of the uninfected rat, and that these differences would hold key information about the pathways mediating host responses to Leptospira infection.",

However, they rarely develop symptoms and are not noticeably impaired by infection of their kidneys [1,15,16]. We have recently detected chronic asymptomatic renal colonization by Leptospira in human subjects from a rural Amazonian village [10]. We reasoned that the structural and functional changes in the kidney that arise following asymptomatic Leptospira infection are different from symptomatic disease. These differences between the asymptomatic and symptomatic leptospirotic kidneys can be understood by studying the downstream products of the kidney, such as urine.",

The following criteria were used for the identification of peptide sequences and related proteins: trypsin as enzyme; three missed cleavages per peptide were allowed and mass tolerances of \u00b1 50 ppm for precursor ions and \u00b1 0.8 Da for fragment ions were used. Validation based on separate target and decoy searches and subsequent calculation of classical score-based false discovery rates (FDR) were used for assessing the statistical significance of the identifications. Finally, to assign a final score to proteins, the SEQUEST output data were filtered as follows: 1,5; 2.0; 2.25 and 2.5 were chosen as minimum values of correlation score (Xcorr) for single-; double-; triple- and quadrupole-charged ions, respectively. A high stringency was guaranteed using parameters previously described [18] and the false-positive peptide ratio, calculated through a reverse database, was less than 3%. The output data, protein lists, obtained from the Sequest search were compared using an in-house software, namely, the Multidimensional Algorithm Protein Map (MAProMa) [19].",

By both multivariate analysis of PLS-DA (Fig. 4) and univariate ANOVA, CD13 is significantly upregulated in the infected rat urine exosome. When the analysis was conducted without gender specificity (Table 4), only CD13 showed an FDR of <10% among these 11 dysregulated proteins. Taking into account gender specificity (Table 2) CD13 was not only significantly upregulated, but also had an FDR of <10%. However, in females, this protein was only significantly upregulated but did not reach the FDR cutoff (Table 3).",

However, it is neither practical nor ethical, given the invasive nature. Urine exosome analyses is non-invasive, highly specific and provides a window into the organ level structural or functional changes. If implemented quickly enough in a translational research setting, this specificity potentially imparts ability to move the field towards personalized medicine.Gender-specific host responses to disease onset: our data shows that this methodology of studying differences between male and female host response to infection can be applied in the setting of human disease. Although we should expect different molecules other than CD13 to by dysregulated, the individual-specific pathways mediating different magnitude responses to the same infection can be accurately measured using exosome markers that are either surrogately or directly linked to a particular host-response event. This assumes importance especially in the setting of sub-clinical leptospirosis infection where in the patient does not display any clinical features/symptoms but continues to play host to the bacterium.\n\n",
