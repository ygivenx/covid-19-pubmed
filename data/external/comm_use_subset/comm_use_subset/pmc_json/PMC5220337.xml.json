Of these, 8 primer sets were identified as capable of amplifying target RNA, and a probe (NOP1) was designed that would accommodate all 8 sets (Table 1). The primer sets were then tested for the time to fluorescence threshold with the probe and compared (Fig. 1). Six primer sets produced signal with the probe, and two of the sets\u2014NOF5-NOR11 and NOF5-NOR12\u2014produced signal significantly (p < 0.05) faster than three other sets and also performed similarly when used on heated stool (data not shown). One set was discarded because it produced signal with widely inconsistent time to result. Due to resource constraints, one set (NOF5-R11 with NOP1) was chosen for subsequent evaluation.",

RT-RPA applied to serially-diluted purified RNA samples produced signal for a wide range of virus input levels, was highly repeatable, and identified virus in all patient samples. RNA copy number over a range of 0.2 log10 genomic copies (LGC) to 9.4 LGC per reaction produced positive signal fluorescence within 6.1 min to 21.5 min.

The repeatable amplification and positive signal of GII.4 Sydney suggests that some degree of base mismatching is tolerated in the RT-RPA system, despite its reliance on recombinase enzymes (Table 4). There were a total of 6 mismatches in the assay\u2019s targeted region when comparing GII.4 New Orleans and Sydney strains, whereas there were 16 mismatches when comparing GII.3 with GII.4 New Orleans. Sydney does not differ from New Orleans in the probe region and has only 4 and 3 base mismatches in the forward and reverse primer target regions, respectively. GII.3 has 3 probe, 2 forward, and 11 reverse primer target region mismatches. It is likely that the reverse primer target region is the reason for the lack of consistent reactivity for GII.3.",

In purified RNA extracts, the assay limit of detection was 3.40 LGC per reaction. When human fecal samples positive for norovirus GII.4 New Orleans were extracted for RNA isolation followed by RT-RPA, virus could be detected in all patient specimens, with longer amplification times to target signal corresponding to lower input template concentrations. It was possible to detect norovirus when 20% fecal specimens were heated to release the viral RNA, without further purification. With this heat release method, lower limits of detection were around 5.0 LGC per reaction. Although not as sensitive as the RT-qPCR, the RT-RPA assay appears to have similar analytical sensitivity to conventional RT-PCR and other human norovirus isothermal assays1112.",

A disadvantage with respect to human norovirus detection may be lack of broad reactivity (i.e., high specificity), perhaps because the recombinase enzyme used is thought to have higher fidelity than PCR67. However, in our work some degree of base mismatch appears to have been tolerated as we were able to detect two different GII.4 strains, although older strains have not been evaluated. However, having a method that reliably detects GII.4 norovirus is relevant as this genotype is responsible for at least 70% of norovirus cases in the United States23 and 80\u201395% of outbreaks globally24.

            "text": "With the exception of the early work of Greene et al.12, this is the first study of isothermal amplification in which fecal suspensions without prior RNA extraction were used as template. Our results are generally consistent with Greene et al.12 in that the RT-RPA assay produced more positives in samples with higher concentrations of fecal material as compared to RT-qPCR. Specifically, for our study\u2019s comparisons of sample positivity for 20% stool suspensions, about 60% were positive by RT-RPA while less than 20% of those same samples were positive by RT-qPCR (Figure S1). This suggests that the RT-RPA method may have more tolerance for inhibitory compounds. When RPA was used for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis from urine samples, no notable amplification inhibition occurred, although it was common when using PCR25. The authors hypothesized that RPA would be less susceptible to amplification inhibition because the assay relies on enzyme components and conditions more comparable to biological systems. For example, the use of a recombinase enzyme may provide increased primer binding efficiency. A polymerase derived from a bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis) that can grow at 37 \u00b0C may be more physiologically familiar, as would be an amplification reaction occurring under isothermal conditions of 40 \u00b0C7. Interestingly, the isothermal LAMP assay has also been shown to have a higher tolerance for inhibitors in other biological samples262728. For instance, Enotomoto et al.28 successfully directly detected herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) in swab samples from patients with gingiovostomatitis or vesicular skin eruptions. In the same year, Kaneko et al.27 found similar evidence for HSV-1 and HSV-2 with a LAMP assay considerably outperforming PCR when samples were directly amplified without DNA purification in patients with genitalitis, keratitis, and uveitis. Perhaps the most comprehensive evaluation of the sample matrix on isothermal amplification, Kaneko et al.26 evaluated the HSV-1 LAMP assay relative to PCR in saline solution, PBS, Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium, serum, plasma, urine, aqueous, and vitreous solutions of different concentrations spiked with a low level of HSV-1 DNA. Although inhibition was inevitably noted at high concentrations for both assays, LAMP outperformed PCR26. However, further comparisons of isothermal methods to PCR are necessary before broad conclusions about the impact of inhibitors on amplification efficiency can be made.",

            "text": "This GII.4 norovirus RT-RPA assay displayed poorer analytical sensitivity (detection limit) than several previously reported assays for other viral pathogens. These earlier studies used an RNA standard to determine analytical sensitivity and showed RT-RPA detection limits <1 LGC for bovine coronavirus9, and Rift Valley fever, Ebola, Marburg, Sudan and Sigma viruses2930. This is 2 LGC better than the limit of detection reported for our assay. However, our limit of detection was similar to that reported for a foot and mouth disease virus assay (3.16 LGC)31. There are a number of explanations for the differences in detection limits reported in the literature. Firstly, in the earlier studies, detection limits were based on an RNA standard generated from a plasmid, while our study used RNA directly purified from clinical samples. We believe that the latter approach, while producing higher detection limits, is more biologically relevant, because a full length genome may consume more RPA enzyme and also contain regions of increased secondary structure, both of which can impede enzymatic action32. Alternatively, the length of the amplicon reported here is longer than those reported by Euler et al.2930 and Amer et al.9, but is similar in length to that reported by Abd El Wahed et al.31, who showed a similar higher limit of detection.",

            "text": "The RT-RPA assay was able to amplify the two most recent circulating epidemic GII.4 norovirus strains. This implies that despite its high fidelity, the assay is able to tolerate slight differences in target sequence. This is in agreement with Boyle et al.33, who reported that two different HIV-1 RPA primer-probe sets were capable of amplifying nearly all HIV-1 subtypes, including one isolate with 9 mismatches. In our report, GII.4 Sydney containing 6 total mismatches in the target region was readily amplified. The data of Daher et al.34, which focused on using RPA for amplification of conserved genes for several bacteria, showed a similar tolerance to base pair mismatches. Interestingly, the GII.3 template was inconsistently amplified by the NOF5-NOR11-NOP1 primer-probe set, the amplified region of which contained base mismatches on the 3\u2032 end of NOF5 and NOR11 target regions in addition to a large number of mismatches (Table 4). Such placement of mismatches was found by Daher et al.34 to be more inhibitory to amplification than internal or 5\u2032 mismatches. The fact that the primer-probe set reported here did not amplify any other relevant enteric virus or bacterial nucleic acid suggests that it shows good specificity, reducing the likelihood of false positives. However, future studies building upon the foundational work presented here analyzing a larger number and diversity of human norovirus clinical samples must be completed to validate and evaluate the suitability of this assay for large scale clinical settings. For instance, analysis of the assay\u2019s reactivity with earlier strains of the GII.4 genotype and reactivity with the GII.17 genotype that is emerging as a genotype of significance35 would be valuable future work. Another logical future direction to build on this work would be to design and optimize more degenerate primer-probe sets and potentially multiplex the assay for immediate genogrouping analysis.",

Theoretically, the RT-RPA assay is capable of direct, portable detection of epidemic human norovirus in clinical samples with minimal expertise in less than 30 minutes.

Five min after the reactions were started, the cycler was paused, reactions mixed, spun down, and placed back on the thermal cycler to continue cycling. The total time to produce signal was calculated by the following equation (1): (Total Time Thermal Cycler Not Recording Reaction) + (Ct Value * 30 sec/cycle).",

Tubes were cooled on ice, mixed and briefly centrifuged. These heated stool dilutions were used directly as a template in RT-RPA reactions as described above, and in RT-qPCR reactions using the JJV2F-COG2R-Ring2-TP primer probe set (Table 1). In addition, NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG RNA extracts from each clinical sample were serially diluted and used in RT-RPA and RT-qPCR. The degree of correlation between RT-RPA time to detection (in min) and log10 genomic copy input (by standard curve) was determined by linear regression using Microsoft Excel 2013 (Figure S2). For evaluating the RT-RPA assay analytical sensitivity, serial dilutions of purified RNA from three selected stool samples (samples 29, 47, and 58) were tested using as described above for a total of 8 replicates and a probit regression was performed for each using the JMP 12 software package (SAS, Cary, NC). The limit of detection and standard deviation was calculated by averaging the three values produced by the regressions. Each value reflected the predicted LGC for which 95% of tests would produce a positive result. All reaction sets included no template controls to confirm lack of contamination.",
