There is considerable field and experimental evidence that dromedary camels serve as an important reservoir host involved in transmission to humans [3,4,5,6,7,8], but whether other livestock such as goats, sheep, and horses play a role in transmission has only been assessed indirectly. The virus is phylogenetically similar to betacoronaviruses previously detected in bats and there has been speculation that this disease originated through a cross-species transmission from bats to camels or humans [9,10,11].",

Similarly, horses tested in the United Arab Emirates lacked antibodies to MERS-CoV [14]. Direct contact with dromedaries in Saudi Arabia was found to be independently associated with MERS-CoV illness, while contact with goats, sheep, or horses was not associated with human illness [15]. In vitro studies in which replication of MERS-CoV in cultured cells was assessed have yielded mixed results with respect to species susceptibility. Cells from goats, but not sheep or cattle, supported replication of MERS-CoV [16], and primary equine kidney cells supported virus replication, albeit at lower levels than observed with Vero cells [14]. Transfection of the DPP4 receptor from goats, sheep, and horses into non-permissive mouse or hamster cells allowed replication of MERS-CoV [17,18]. Collectively, these in vitro studies suggest the possibility that some livestock are susceptible to infection, but demonstration of infection in live animals is required to better assess their potential as reservoir hosts.",

Goats (n = 5) were evaluated for viral shedding, organ burden, and seroconversion and transmission to co-housed goats (n = 2). Limited viral shedding was observed without demonstration of viral transmission. Due to the lack of transmission, only viral shedding and serology were evaluated in horses (n = 4) and sheep (n = 3). These animals did not become productively infected or seroconvert, indicating that such livestock are unlikely to serve as reservoirs for MERS-CoV and are unimportant in viral transmission.",

Very limited amounts of infectious virus were detected in nasal swab specimens of some of the experimentally infected animals, but not in uninfected, co-housed goats. It is possible that the infectious virus detected was residual from the input virus, at least on day 1 post-infection. However, a previous study with alpacas re-challenged 80 days after an initial infection was not able to detect infectious virus upon re-challenge indicating that input challenge virus is not detected one day after infection, although the role of secretory antibodies was not addressed in that study [19]. Similarly, another study with alpacas re-challenged on day 28 post-infection was unable to detect viral RNA upon re-challenge [21]. In comparison to experimentally infected dromedaries, significantly less virus was isolated from the livestock in this study. Since the main objective of this study was to determine the role these animals might play in transmission of the virus, we chose to test these samples by plaque assay in order to determine the amount of infectious virus present, rather than by RT-PCR which only reveals the presence of viral RNA regardless of infectivity.",
