            "text": "Children living in areas of stable Plasmodium falciparum transmission acquire substantial protective immunity against malaria during the first decade of life. Protection is mediated to a large extent by variant surface antigen (VSA)-specific IgG. Nevertheless, women in such areas remain highly susceptible to P. falciparum infection if they become pregnant, as the parasites can switch to expression of particular VSA (called VSAPAM), which allow infected erythrocyte (IE) sequestration in the placenta, but which are not compatible with parasite survival in a nonpregnant host. Acquired immunity to PAM is mediated by VSAPAM-specific IgG that either opsonizes IEs for phagocytosis or interferes with chondroitin sulphate A (CSA)-specific adhesion of IEs (1). VAR2CSA, which is a member of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family of VSA, appears to be the dominant or only pregnancy-associated Plasmodium falciparum malaria (PAM) type VSA in the P. falciparum genome, and is therefore the main target of current efforts to develop a vaccine against PAM (2). To assist this work, we have developed a panel of VSAPAM-specific human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (3), which can opsonize VSAPAM-expressing IEs for phagocytosis and interfere with IE adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al. unpublished data). These antibodies can be used to enrich for VSAPAM expression in parasites not expressing VSAPAM but obtained from women with PAM (3). In the present study we used two of the above-mentioned monoclonal antibodies to select for VSAPAM expression in parasites from nonpregnant donors. One antibody (PAM1\u00b74) was chosen because it appears to react with most or all parasites expressing VSAPAM. The other antibody (PAM8\u00b71) was chosen because it reacts with a well-defined, but inter-clonally variant, epitope in the DBL3X domain of VAR2CSA.",

            "text": "We used eight VSAPAM-specific monoclonal IgG1 antibodies generated as described elsewhere (3; 4). VSAPAM is defined here as IE surface-expressed VSA, which are significantly better recognized by plasma IgG from P. falciparum-exposed multigravidae than from sympatric men, and where the recognition by plasma IgG from these men is not significantly different from recognition by plasma IgG from nonexposed controls. In contrast, typical non-PAM VSAs are better recognized by plasma IgG from P. falciparum-exposed adults than from nonexposed donors, without marked sex-dependent differences. Seven of the monoclonal antibodies used here are specific for inter-clonally variant epitopes in either the DBL3-X or the DBL5-\u025b domain of VAR2CSA (3). The exact specificity of the last antibody (PAM1\u00b74) remains undefined, but it appears to recognize a conformational, and possibly discontinuous, epitope in VAR2CSA that is difficult to reproduce in recombinant constructs (3). PAM1\u00b74 recognizes VSAPAM expressed by most or all P. falciparum genotypes, whereas the VAR2CSA DBL3-X epitope recognized by PAM8\u00b71 is present in some, but not all P. falciparum clones (3). Both PAM1\u00b74 and PAM8\u00b71 can opsonize VSAPAM-expressing IEs for phagocytosis and interfere with their adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al. in preparation).",

In brief, monoclonal PAM1\u00b74 or PAM8\u00b71 antibodies were immobilized on Protein A-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) and mixed with 3D7- or HB3-IEs. IEs adhering to the antibody-coated beads were isolated in a strong magnetic field and subsequently returned to in vitro culture. Selection protocol was repeated when multiplication of the antibody-selected parasites allowed it. VSA expression was assessed by flow cytometry analysis as described elsewhere (8). We used plasma from 10 P. falciparum-exposed multigravidae, 10 sympatric men, and 10 nonexposed controls to assess the sex-specificity of VSA recognition. According to the original criteria (9), sex-specific recognition requires that (i) levels of IE-surface reactive IgG are significantly higher in P. falciparum-exposed multigravidae than in sympatric men, and that (ii) the difference in IgG levels in P. falciparum-exposed men and nonexposed controls is not statistically significant. We used term plasma from 30 P. falciparum-exposed women (10 pregnant for the first time, 10 for the third time, and 10 for the fifth time) to assess parity-dependency, which requires a statistically significant relationship between IgG levels and number of pregnancies in P. falciparum-exposed women (9). Parasite isolates were only considered to express VSAPAM if plasma IgG recognition of IEs was both sex-specific and parity-dependent.",

We used primer pairs specific for the 59 vargenes in the 3D7 genome (12) and for 45 var genes in the HB3 genome (Table S1 in Supporting Information). The latter were tested on genomic DNA dilutions to ascertain appropriate fragment size, melting temperature, and amplification efficiency compared to the internal control seryl-tRNA synthetase.

Furthermore, IE surface-reactive IgG levels did not depend on parity (Table 1 and Figure 1a). Thus, unselected 3D7 and HB3 both showed typical non-PAM-type plasma antibody recognition patterns of IE surface-expressed VSA. This was confirmed by the nonreactivity of 3D7- and HB3-IEs with all eight VSAPAM-specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1d). When VSA expression was re-assessed after three rounds of selection (about 6 weeks after the first round of selection), the recognition of 3D7- and HB3-IEs selected on either PAM1\u00b74 or PAM8\u00b71 all showed an indeterminate VSA phenotype, where one but not both criteria for sex-specific antibody recognition were met (Table 1 and Figure 1b). PAM8\u00b71-selected 3D7 remained nonreactive with the four monoclonal antibodies used for testing at this time (PAM1\u00b74, PAM3\u00b710, PAM4\u00b77, and PAM8\u00b71), whereas the other three parasite lines showed reactivity with at least one of them (Figure 1e). These results suggested that further rounds of selection might lead to definite VSAPAM expression, at least for PAM1\u00b74-selected 3D7, PAM1\u00b74- and PAM8\u00b71-selected HB3. Indeed, PAM1\u00b74-selected 3D7, as well as PAM1\u00b74- and PAM8\u00b71-selected HB3 had all acquired a typical sex-specific and parity dependent VSAPAM expression pattern after four additional rounds of selection (Table 1 and Figure 1c), and reacted with all the monoclonal antibodies except the VAR2CSA DBL5-\u025b-specific PAM4\u00b77 (Figure 1f). In contrast, 3D7 selected seven times for reactivity with PAM8\u00b71 retained an indeterminate sex-specificity pattern also seen after three rounds of selection, did not acquire the parity-dependent pattern typical of VSAPAM-expressing lines (Table 1), and did not react with any of the eight VSAPAM-specific monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1f). Thus, PAM8\u00b71 could not be used to select 3D7 for VSAPAM reactivity, consistent with the absence of the predicted epitope for this antibody in the VAR2CSA DBL3-X domain of this parasite (3).",

In contrast, PAM8\u00b71 selection did not affect the proportion of var2csa transcripts in 3D7 (Figure 1g). The HB3 genome contains two var2csa paralogs, var2csa-A and var2csa-B (13). In unselected HB3 parasites, var2csa-A transcripts constituted 1% of the measured var transcripts, increasing to 28% and 4% after seven rounds of selection by PAM1\u00b74 and PAM8\u00b71, respectively (Figure 1h). Transcript levels of the var2csa-B gene increased from 23% to 57% and 92% after seven rounds of selection by PAM1\u00b74 and PAM8\u00b71, respectively (Figure 1h). No var transcript other than var2csa showed marked changes, and var2csa was therefore the dominant transcript in all the parasites following antibody selection. The dominance of var2csa-B transcripts relative to var2csa-A in HB3 after PAM8\u00b71 selection, suggested that the DBL3-X domain in the protein encoded by var2csa-B might be of the FCR3-type recognized by PAM8\u00b71, whereas the corresponding domain encoded by var2csa-A might be of the 3D7-type (PFL0030 c) not recognized by PAM8\u00b71 (2). However, var2csa-A and var2csa-B encode an identical amino acid sequence in the region spanning the PAM8\u00b71 epitope, and this sequence was of the FCR3-type (Figure 1i). The var2csa-A : var2csa-B transcripts may therefore reflect a founder effect.",

It has been speculated that switching to VSAPAM expression requires signals from the pregnant host, for example hormones, and that selection therefore might not be possible unless the parasite is derived from such a host. It has also been argued that selection of parasites by panning on CSA in vitro might result in expression of antigens of dubious relevance to the antigens expressed as a result of in vivo selection occurring in the pregnant woman. Our data show that switching to expression of genuine VSAPAM can occur in vitro in the absence of external signals, in line with other recent evidence (18). By extension, these findings suggest that switching to VSAPAM in vivo also occurs spontaneously regardless of the pregnancy status of the host. In a pregnant host, such parasites will often be at a selective advantage (because of the frequent absence of VSAPAM-specific immunity in women of low parity) (19), whereas they appear to be unable to survive in a nonpregnant host (20).",

            "text": "Third, our results support the hypothesis that although interclonal variation in VAR2CSA is the result of antibody-driven positive selection, the diversity of functionally important antibody epitopes in the molecule is constrained (21). Thus, some parasites can express VAR2CSA without being vulnerable to recognition by certain VAR2CSA-reactive antibodies, because of variation in defined parts of VAR2CSA. The persistent nonrecognition by PAM8\u00b71 of VAR2CSA-expressing 3D7 is a case in point. At the same time, the PAM8\u00b71 antibody, originally identified by its reactivity with VSAPAM-expressing FCR3-IEs (3), was effectively selected for VSAPAM expression in the genetically unrelated HB3 clone. The significance of these findings is underscored by the fact that PAM8\u00b71 efficiently opsonizes IEs for phagocytosis as well as interferes with IE adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al. in preparation). Our study also corroborates existing evidence that PAM1\u00b74 recognizes most if not all VSAPAM-expressing parasites by recognizing a functionally highly constrained and conformation-dependent discontinuous epitope in VAR2CSA (3). Like PAM8\u00b71, PAM1\u00b74 is an opsonin and capable of interfering with IE adhesion to CSA (Barfod et al. in preparation). Therefore, the PAM1\u00b74 epitope is a highly attractive candidate for development of a PAM-specific vaccine, and its characterization is a matter of the highest priority in our current research. Although the theoretical possibility of another, non-PfEMP1 target of PAM1\u00b74 remains, available evidence point to VAR2CSA.",
