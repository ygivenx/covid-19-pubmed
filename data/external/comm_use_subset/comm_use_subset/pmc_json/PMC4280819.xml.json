These techniques can generate tens of thousands of sequence reads directly from a clinical sample, and sequence alignment tools subsequently can reveal the presence of previously unknown viruses. The main limitation of these viral metagenomics techniques is that the detection of sequence reads derived from a viral genome does not necessarily indicate that the virus is pathogenic, in the absence of information on phenotypic properties such as infectivity, cell tropism, and the ability to induce the immune system.1",

A virus culture stage is thus needed to obtain relatively pure virus stocks for inoculation in an animal model. Virus culturing remains a major bottleneck. In the 20th century, virus research and identification were for a large part limited to those agents that could be cultured in conventional cell lines. More recently, powerful sequencing methods allow the identification of new viruses in clinical samples, for which a virus culture as amplification step is no longer required. The downside is that without a virus culture, it is not possible to formally fulfill the Koch's postulates. As a result, one can describe, at most, a disease association, either by a higher viral prevalence in infected subjects compared to controls or by seroconversion to the agent during the course or following the disease.2",

There is, however, one pitfall with HAE cultures. Even with a fast replicating respiratory virus, a cytopathic effect is rarely observed. Some influenzavirus A strains cause cell death, but the majority of infections do not change the epithelial layer. Thus, HAE should be combined with a virus detection, for which we propose immunostaining with convalescent serum collected from the same patient obtained a few weeks after the respiratory infection. This serum will likely contain substantial antibody titers against the virus that caused the respiratory illness a few weeks earlier.",

Subsequently, nucleic acids were extracted by the Boom method.18 rRNA-blocking oligonucleotides were added to prevent amplification of ribosomal RNA, and a reverse transcription reaction with Superscript II (Invitrogen) was performed using non-ribosomal random hexamers.19 Subsequently, second-strand DNA synthesis was performed with 5 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Double-stranded DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and digested with Mse I restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). Adaptors with different Multiplex Identifier sequences (MIDs) were ligated to the digested fragments of the different samples. Before PCR amplification, the fragments were purified with AMPure XP beads (Agencourt AMPure XP PCR, Beckman Coulter, Massachusetts, USA). Next, a 28-cycle PCR with adaptor-binding primers was performed: the program of PCR was as follows: 5 minutes 95\u00b0C, and cycles of 1 minute 95\u00b0C, 1 minute 55\u00b0C, and 2 minutes 72\u00b0C, followed by 10 minutes 72\u00b0C and 10 minutes 4\u00b0C.

This provides the opportunity of identifying viruses that are highly divergent from known viruses because the inclusion of a conserved domain is more likely. Of each apical wash, only a few thousand sequence reads were sufficient. The low number of reads needed to identify the cultured virus has the advantage that many samples can be analyzed in parallel in a single 454 run (approximately 150 samples per run), which makes the assay only moderately expensive. One should note, however, that this combined assay is currently not suitable to be used in a high-throughput setting, because of the significant hands-on time and expert experience needed to prepare the HAE cell cultures. On the other hand, the availability of a culture method is enormously beneficial for follow-up studies as it provides the progeny virus material, for example, for inoculation of animals to fulfill the postulates of Koch.",

Three respiratory samples, S2705 (HCoV-OC43), I2125 (influenzavirus A, H3N2), and E1517 (influenzavirus B), were used to inoculate human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures. The cells were fixed 96 or 120 hours post-inoculation with 4% PFA and immunostained with the autologous antibody derived from respective patients (red) and mouse monoclonal anti-\u00df-tubulin IV (green), and examined by confocal microscopy. The difference in intensity of tubulin staining represents experimental variation in differentiation (S2705 versus E1517) or a difference in focus depth (I2125, below the apical surface). An overlay image was generated to determine the cell tropism of each virus. Bars: 30 \u03bcm.",
