There are currently no licensed medical interventions (drugs, other therapeutics or vaccines) available to treat or prevent ZIKV infection and the development of severe disease. The wide cross reactivity among different flavivirus6 and the risk associated with the antibody dependent enhancement7 strongly request the identification of protective and pathogenetic immune signature to ZIKV.",

During the acute and convalescent phases of ZIKV infection, increased levels of Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 cytokines have been reported, suggesting that a polyfunctional T-cell response is required for recovery from ZIKV infection10. Nevertheless, an unbalanced immunoactivation with high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the cerebrospinal fluid has been associated to encephalomyelitis11. Although the main role played by humoral response12, an involvement of CD8 T cell response in the protection against ZIKV infection has been recently suggested in a mouse model of ZIKV infection13. Moreover, the activation of T-cells and their Th1 polarization has been also recently demonstrated in mice14. No data are available on the cellular-mediated immune response during the acute phase of ZIKV infection in humans.",

Moreover, a significant higher frequency of CD38neg/HLA-DRpos CD8 T-cells was observed in ZIKV-patients than in HD (Fig. 2a). CD4 T-cells showed a lower level of activation than CD8 T-cells both in ZIKV and DENV patients but CD38pos CD4 T-cells were significantly higher in ZIKV and DENV than in HD (Fig. 2c). Although a trend of CD38 increase on DN T cells during DENV infection, no significant difference was observed on the activation of DN T-cells among HD, ZIKV and DENV, probably due to the small sample size (Fig. 2e).\n",

The analysis of CD8 T-cells did not show any difference on the differentiation profile between ZIKV, DENV and HD (Fig. 3a). In contrast, a significant difference was observed in the differentiation profile of CD4 (KW < 0.05) and DN (KW < 0.05) T-cells. In particular, ZIKV patients showed a lower frequency of CM-CD4 T-cells in comparison to both HD and DENV patients, and a parallel higher frequency of EM-CD4 T-cells and TEMRA-CD4 T-cells in ZIKV respect to HD (Fig. 3c). Similar results were obtained by analysing DN T-cells: indeed, a lower frequency of CM-DN T- cells was observed in ZIKV in comparison to both HD and DENV patients and a parallel higher frequency of TEMRA-DN T-cells in ZIKV respect to HD (Fig. 3e). Finally, an inverse correlation between days after symptoms onset and EM CD8 T-cell frequency was observed (Pearson R: \u22120.76, R Squared 0.58, p = 0.04).\n",

Results showed that the large majority of DN T-cells expressed a V\u03b42 TCR (Fig. 4a), suggesting that the DN T-cell population expanded during ZIKV infection belongs to the V\u03b42 T-cell subset. Accordingly, the frequency of V\u03b42 T-cells within CD3 T-cells was significantly different among HD, ZIKV and DENV (KW < 0.05). In particular, V\u03b42 T-cells was significantly higher in ZIKV patients than in HD and in DENV patients (Fig. 4b). Notably, the V\u03b42 T-cell expansion was more pronounced in patients sampled during the first 2-3 days from symptoms onset [Pt1 and Pt2: Range (23.8\u201326.6%)] than in the other patients sampled after 6 days [Pt3-6: Range (1.5\u201313.1%)], and an inverse correlation between days after symptoms onset and V\u03b42 T-cell frequency was observed (Pearson R: \u22120.84, R Squared 0.70, p = 0.01, Fig. 4c).

Nevertheless, an excessive T-cell activation observed during severe viral diseases such as severe DENV15 or Ebola viral (EBOV) infection16\u201318 may be harmful to the host, by increasing inflammation and promoting anergy of protective T-cells. We found that ZIKV infection induced a significant activation of CD8 and CD4 T-cells, confirming recent data obtained in mice14. The frequency of CD8 T-cells co-expressing both CD38 and HLA-DR was similar in ZIKV and in DENV patients15, but was lower than during EBOV infection16, 18, suggesting that a moderate activation may be associated to a protective activity and to a mild profile of the disease. In acute infection such as of DENV19 or Ebola virus16\u201318, the activation of T-cells is associated to an increased expression of apoptotic markers. The role of apoptosis during ZIKV infection remains to be defined.",

Other study are necessary to deeply explore the functional properties of effector CD4 T-cells. An effector phenotype of T-cells was also described in the mouse model of ZIKV infection14.

Expanded V\u03b42 T-cells presented an effector phenotype and expressed granzyme B. A pillar role of V\u03b42 T-cells in a well orchestrated immune response to viral infection is well documented21. Indeed, human \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells may affect the progression and outcome of infectious diseases22, 23. Activated V\u03b42 T-cells are able to exert direct antiviral activities and to perform several stimulatory activities on both innate and adaptive immune cells24\u201327. Several reports suggest a protective role of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells during other acute viral infections22, 23, 28\u201330. \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells expand quickly in response to WNV infection, produce significant amount of IFN-\u03b3, limiting the viral load and protecting the host from lethal encephalitis29, 30. We could not directly correlate the V\u03b42 T-cell expansion with a protective effect during ZIKV infection, since all the patients included in this study showed a mild clinical course of the disease and no sequelae were observed. A direct comparison between severe and mild diseases may be helpful in supporting a protective role of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells during ZIKV infection. The analysis of V\u03b42 T-cells may also be important to better understand the pathogenesis associated with severe clinical complications of ZIKV infection such as microcephaly in foetuses2, 3 and/or Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults31. Interestingly, an expansion of V\u03b42 T-cells has been associated with recurrent abortions32, 33. Furthermore, the Th1 profile of expanded V\u03b42 T-cells might contribute to placenta damage and/or inflammation that has been correlated with foetal brain damage during ZIKV infection34. Finally, \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells may play a role during autoimmune diseases35 and in particular during Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome36\u201338, contributing to autoimmune damage.",

The general gating strategy was: FSC-A v. SSC-A > CD3pos > CD4 pos or CD8 pos or CD4 negCD8 neg cells. The activation analysis was performed by analyzing CD38 and HLA-DR expression on i) CD4 pos, ii) CD8 pos and iii) CD4 negCD8 neg cells.
