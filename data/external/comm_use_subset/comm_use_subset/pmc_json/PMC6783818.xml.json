            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV), synonymous with Avian avulavirus 1, is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Avulavirus of the Paramyxoviridae family. It is an avian virus causing high morbidities and mortalities in most species of wild and domestic birds globally and is associated with major economic loss in poultry farms worldwide [1]. Transmission of the virus occurs through exposure to the fecal materials and other excretions of infected birds or contaminated food, water and equipment [1,2,3,4]. In birds, NDV mainly causes diseases in the respiratory, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems. Occasionally, NDV has also caused infections in mammals, such as cattle, sheep, and mink [5,6,7]. In 1952, NDV was isolated from the lung of a six-month-old calf with pneumonia in the United States [7]. In 2012, it was isolated from the blood of two apparently healthy sheep in India [6]. In 2017, it was isolated from an outbreak of hemorrhagic encephalitis and pneumonia in domestic mink from mainland China [5]. For humans, exposure to infected birds can cause mild self-limiting conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms.",

Based on the complete coding sequence of the F protein [8,9,10,11], NDV strains are classified into class I and class II, with class II NDVs being more diverse, and are further classified into genotypes I to XVIII. In terms of pathogenicity, NDVs can be categorized into velogenic (virulent), mesogenic (intermediate), or lentogenic (non-virulent), which have been linked to their virulence in chickens or the presence of conserved amino acids in the F and HN proteins which are known to be involved in pathogenesis of NDV infection, such as virus attachment, host-cell membrane fusion, virus dissemination, and F protein activation [12].",

However, a previous study reported that a pigeon NDV isolate was able to agglutinate camel red blood cells, achieving haemagglutination titer comparable to the level obtained with chicken red blood cells [13]. This suggested that haemagglutination protein binding receptor was also present on the membrane of camel red blood cells, implicating that camel may be susceptible to NDV infection [13]. In this article, we report the first isolation of NDV from the aborted fetus of a dromedary in the United Arab Emirates during the process of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) screening, and results of its comparative genome and phylogenetic analysis.",

BLASTx with an E-value cutoff of 10\u22125 were used to align the clustered reads towards non-redundant (nr) viral protein sequences from NCBI database [20]. The remaining reads were compared to nr protein sequence database using BLASTx with the same E-value cutoff. The final BLAST output was analyzed by matching each sequence to its best hit. The taxonomical content of the dataset was generated and visualized by MEtaGenome ANalyzer (MEGAN) version 6.6.7 where phylogenetic tree computed was assigned to each sequence according to its taxonomical identity in NCBI database [21].",

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete F gene sequences revealed that the DcNDV was most closely related to members of class II genotype VI NDVs (Figure 2a). Within genotype VI, it was most closely related to members of sub-genotype g, sharing the highest nucleotide identity (95%) to strain Pigeon/Egypt/ElFayom/79/1112/2015 (GenBank accession number KY042133). Consistently, phylogenetic analyses based on the HN and the complete polyprotein sequence displayed similar topologies (Figure 2a\u2013c). The pairwise nucleotide identities of all the coding genes of DcNDV and representative strains from Class II genotype VI were shown in Table 4. Sequence analysis based on the complete polyprotein sequences showed that DcNDV shared the highest nucleotide identities, ranging from 96.8 to 97.8%, to the NDVs found in the pigeons from Egypt (Genbank accession numbers KY042129, KY042131, and KY042133), Russia (Genbank accession number JF827026) and Ukraine (Genbank accession numbers KY042128 and KY042127). There were only 18 and 22 amino acid differences between the F and HN proteins of DcNDV and those of the three closest pigeon NDV strains from Egypt, respectively (Figures S1 and S2). Detailed examination of the amino acid alignments revealed that the amino acid changes in the regions containing structurally and functionally important residues and motifs were all conservative substitutions (Figures S1 and S2).",

            "text": "We report the first isolation of NDV in a dromedary. NDV is basically an avian virus which has caused numerous outbreaks of devastating disease in poultries. In the present study, we isolated an NDV from the nasal swab of an aborted dromedary fetus in Dubai using Vero cells, and the virus isolate also produced the typical CPE caused by NDV on chicken embryo fibroblasts. During that period, an NDV outbreak occurred in the pigeon farm located in close proximity to the dairy camel farm where the mother of the aborted dromedary fetus resided and there were a lot of pigeons in the camel farm. We speculate that the mother dromedary had probably acquired the NDV from the pigeons and subsequently transmitted to the fetus. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis revealed that the structurally and functionally important features in the F and HN proteins of the NDV genome observed in previous studies were also present in the genome of this NDV in dromedary. In particular, it also possessed genomic features similar to other velogenic NDVs, including cleavage site motif 112KRQKRF117 in the F protein, conserved amino acid residues at neutralizing epitopes on the HN protein, and the size (i.e., 571 aa) of the HN protein (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3, Figures S1 and S2) [30,31]. On the other hand, we were aware of the limitation of the present study. Viral cultures on other samples of the fetus or the mother were not performed because it was initially intended for MERS-CoV isolation. It is noteworthy that a virus that could be successfully cultured and isolated from Vero cells was subjected to investigation by next-generation sequencing. This suggested that any potential pathogens that were not able to propagate in the Vero cells may have been missed. Nevertheless, although the possibility of NDV infection being responsible for abortion is unknown, the successful isolation of NDV from the aborted dromedary fetus and the absence of positive bacterial and fungal cultures in the placental samples warrant further investigations on the causal relationship between NDV infection and abortion.",

            "text": "The present dromedary NDV was probably resulted from spillover from NDVs in birds of the Middle East. NDVs of class II genotype VI were first isolated from pigeons in the Middle East in the 1960s and spread rapidly throughout Northern Africa to Europe and other parts of the world [11,32]. So far, NDVs of genotype VI have been identified in at least 20 countries of three different continents, including Africa, Europe, and Asia [10,32]. In addition to their widespread distribution, genotype VI NDVs is also highly diverse genetically, dividing into sub-genotypes VIa to Vim [8,9,10,11,32]. In 2015, NDVs of sub-genotype VIg were detected in apparently healthy pigeons kept in captivity in Egypt [32]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the NDV isolated from the aborted dromedary fetus in the present study belongs to sub-genotype VIg and is most closely related to the NDVs found in these healthy pigeons from Egypt in the same year (Figure 2. In fact, whole genome comparative analysis revealed that there is only 2.5\u20135.3% difference in the nucleotide sequence between the dromedary NDV from Dubai and the pigeon NDVs from Egypt, substantiating the theory that the virus probably had transmitted directly from pigeons to dromedary. Notably, they also shared almost the same conserved residues and domains responsible for virulence in the F and HN proteins, suggesting that the present dromedary NDV may also be velogenic, similar to other velogenic NDVs of genotype VI (Figures S1 and S2) [12,33]. Moreover, the present findings are in line with a spillover event recently reported in Nigeria, in which a high degree of sequence similarity between NDVs from domestic and wild birds was observed [34]. The study also discovered some bird species that had not previously been known to be infected by NDVs [34]. Although it is known that pigeons are not migratory, the mechanism of spread of genotype VI NDVs at long distances (i.e., from Egypt to Dubai) in the present study remains to be determined. A possible explanation for the spread of genotype VI NDVs may be due to the international trade of racing pigeons [33]. Further studies to determine the genotype of NDVs circulating in pigeons in Dubai or other parts of the Middle East and to screen for additional NDVs in camels are warranted to understand the present spillover event and the evolution of NDVs.",

In metagenomics studies and subsequent whole genome sequencing, we discovered two novel genotypes of hepatitis E virus (HEV), a novel genus of enterovirus, a novel astrovirus, two novel bocaparvoviruses, and novel picobirnaviruses and circoviruses in dromedaries [26,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. In addition to these metagenomics studies, we have also used next generation sequencing technologies in a previous study and the present study to rapidly identify and sequence the genomes of a West Nile virus and an NDV, respectively [46]. These are the first studies that demonstrate isolation of West Nile virus and NDV in dromedaries. All these studies have remarkably widened the spectrum of viruses found in dromedaries as well as the potential source of infections due the corresponding viruses.",
