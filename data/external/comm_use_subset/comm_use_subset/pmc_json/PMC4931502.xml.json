            "text": "Considering the strongly altered host nucleolar ultrastructure and composition during IAV infection, we analyzed the subcellular localization of three major constitutive nucleolar proteins, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin, during the time course of influenza infection. We used immuno-fluorescence confocal microscopy in human lung epithelial A549 cells, mock-infected or infected by influenza A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) virus, at 7 and 10 hours post infection (hpi). In addition to nucleolin, B23 or fibrillarin immunostaining, we also used NP as an indicator of viral cycle advancement, as previously carried out317181920. As expected in mock-infected cells, the three nucleolar proteins mainly localized in nucleoli (Fig. 1, panels a to h and Supplementary Figure 1B,C). During infection, localization patterns of B23 and fibrillarin remained unmodified up to 7 hpi (data not shown) compared to mock-infected cells, as previously reported727. In contrast, when NS1 is notably accumulated within nucleolus at this time (Supplementary Figure 1A), nucleolin no longer preferentially localized in the subnuclear compartment and instead displayed a broad relocalization throughout the nucleus (Fig. 1, panels i to p; and Supplementary Figure 1A), in accordance with previous study28. Later in infection (10 hpi), as illustrated by the mainly cytoplasmic localization of NP, nucleolin mostly redistributed at the nuclear periphery of more than 95% of the infected cells (Fig. 1, panels q to x). At this time most of the fibrillarin accumulated in a large nuclear spot (Supplementary Figure 1B), probably linked to the ultrastructural remodeling of the nucleolar compartment317181920, whereas B23 remained associated (Supplementary Figure 1C).",

Despite their specific host-range restriction56, all viruses efficiently infected A549 cells with comparable kinetics, as we previously reported317. We performed immunolabeling at 24 hpi, a time corresponding to late stage of infection for all these viruses (Supplementary Figure 2A). As observed for H3N2, each infection led to a similar redistribution of endogenous nucleolin towards the nuclear periphery of infected cells (Supplementary Figure 2A). Interestingly, the observed subnuclear localization pattern of nucleolin in IAV infected cells clearly evoked the previously described polarized distribution of trafficking vRNPs that formed a cap at the apex of the nuclear envelope prior to their export towards the cytoplasm5758. To note, similar NP-nucleolin colocalization and subnuclear localization patterns were also observed using another specific monoclonal antibody raised against NP (MAb 3/1, kind gift of Dr Webster) that was reported to recognize IAV vRNP complexes59 (Supplementary Figure 2B).",

            "text": "To further explore this hypothesis, we first performed a GST pull-down assay to examine whether endogenous nucleolin could interact with nucleoprotein, the main component of vRNPs. A549 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding NP fused to GST (GST-NP, H3N2), and cell lysates were pulled down using glutathione sepharose beads at 48 h post transfection. Complexes were analyzed by western blot with anti-GST and anti-nucleolin antibodies. As controls, cell lysates obtained after transfection of non-fused GST, GST-NS1 or GST-NEP were also examined as controls. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous nucleolin was pulled down from GST-NP lysates (Fig. 3A, lane 2). In comparison, no interaction with nucleolin was characterized with cell lysate obtained after transfection of non-fused GST protein (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In addition, a very weak interaction with nucleolin was characterized with GST-NS1 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). This partial discrepancy with a previous study29 could be explained by the different strain origin of the NS1 tested (A/WSN/33), especially considering other reports showing strikingly different properties among NS1 of various origins28. Another explanation would be our experimental conditions being based on transient expression in A549 cells and not on the use of recombinant proteins expressed from bacteria29. On the other hand, our use of GST-NEP protein expression as a negative control did confirm no interaction with nucleolin (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Additionally, this interaction between endogenous nucleolin and transiently expressed NP was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay using a specific rabbit polyclonal anti-nucleolin antibody43 (data not shown).",

As expected, western blot confirmed the immunoprecipitation of nucleolin specifically by the rabbit polyclonal anti-nucleolin antibody compared to IgG control (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 5 and 8 versus 3, 6 and 9). The immunoprecipitated complexes from infected cells contained NP, the amount of which increased from 8 hpi to 24 hpi (Fig. 3B, lane 5 versus 8). Otherwise, RNAse A treatment did not abolished immunoprecipitation of NP, suggesting nucleolin could interact with both vRNP and non-vRNP forms of NP (Supplementary Figure 3). Alternatively, we investigated the presence of vRNA in immunoprecipitated complexes in similar experimental conditions (Fig. 3C). To this end, we subjected cell lysates of infected cells (8 and 24 hpi) to anti-nucleolin immunoprecipitation before extracting the putative associated vRNAs for quantification by specific RT-qPCR (Fig. 3C), described in our previous study60. As expected, total cell lysates at 24 hpi contained more vRNA copies as compared to those at 8 hpi; total cell lysates from mock-infected cells contained no detectable vRNA. Accordingly, we detected vRNAs in complex containing NP at 8 hpi and mostly at 24 hpi, whereas no vRNA in control (IgG) (Fig. 3C, right panel).",

As expected, the si-Nucleolin treated cells displayed very low levels of nucleolin staining at 8 and 24 hpi, as compared to si-Control (Fig. 4A, panels e and m). Interestingly, the silencing of nucleolin expression appeared to only slightly decrease the number of NP positive cells (Fig. 4A, panels b versus f, j versus n and Fig. 4B, upper panel), suggesting a limited impact on cell infectivity. In contrast, the si-nucleolin treatment strongly affected the subcellular localization of NP during infection (Fig. 4A, panels b versus f, j versus n) in such a way that 1.9 to 3 times more cells harbored a stringent nuclear pattern only for NP in this condition, compared to the si-Control condition at 8 and 24 hpi, respectively. At both time intervals post-infection, the viral cycle appeared more advanced in the presence of endogenous nucleolin as shown by a more pronounced cytoplasmic staining for NP in infected cells (Fig. 4B, lower panel).",

A549 cells, previously transfected with si-Control or si-Nucleolin, were infected with H3N2 virus (MOI 1) for 24 h and harvested for nucleocytoplasmic fractionation. As a control, we studied the expression of histone H3 and \u03b2-tubulin. As expected, endogenous nucleolin had been silenced in the different sub-cellular fractions (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1, 3 and 5 with lanes 2, 4 and 6, respectively). Moreover, the two experimental si-RNA conditions showed no difference in terms of expression levels of NP and PB1 viral proteins in whole cell extracts, suggesting no effect on viral protein expression (Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, we noted a strong increase of NP and PB1 in the nuclear fractions of si-Nucleolin-treated cells as compared to those of si-Control (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4), while the cytoplasm fractions displayed similar protein ratios between the two si-RNA conditions (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 2). We completed this analysis by performing total RNA extraction from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, followed by a quantification of viral genome copy numbers by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4D). Results revealed no difference in cytoplasmic fractions between si-Nucleolin and si-Control (Fig. 4D, left panel). In contrast, the nuclear fraction of si-Nucleolin treated cells contained a significative higher level of vRNA copies than that of the control (Fig. 4D, right panel, p-value <0.05). In accordance with these results, the silencing of nucleolin also significantly reduced the yield of progeny virus produced at 24 and 30 hpi, as compared to si-Control conditions. Quantification of vRNA copies number/ml in cell supernatants revealed a marked decrease in viral progeny yield that could reach up to 95.5% at 30 hpi, (MOI 0.2, Fig. 4E) or up to 63% at 30 hpi (MOI 2, Fig. 4E). This result was also confirmed by quantification of infectious titers (TCID50/mL) in supernatants, with a slight decrease and a delay of viral production in the context of silencing of nucleolin (Fig. 4F).",

We used western blot detection of NP as a marker of vRNP and different subcellular markers, such as \u03b2-tubulin (cytoplasm), histone H3 (chromatin), to confirm the successfulness of fractionation (Fig. 5). In accordance with Chase et al.1365, NP was detected in all cellular fractions, including the ch150 and ch500 fractions at 24 hpi (Fig. 5A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). Interestingly, nucleolin was shared between nucleoplasmic and ch500 fractions in mock-infected cells, whereas at 24 hpi, it had slightly accumulated in the ch500 fraction (Fig. 5A, compare lane 10 versus 9) Thus, these results suggest that nucleolin relocalizes to regions of high chromatin density where vRNP export complexes accumulate during infection.",

In this context, several studies including ours have described the extensive modifications of nuclear ultrastructure and composition7530 with marked nucleolar and chromatin alterations in IAV infected cells171820. In accordance with these observations, we report in this study the differential delocalization through the nucleus of the three major nucleolar components, nucleolin, B23 and fibrillarin during the time-course of IAV infection. Interestingly, the earlier and specific redistribution of nucleolin was of interest and in particular its dynamic colocalization with NP at the vicinity of the inner nuclear membrane, where vRNPs accumulate before their nuclear export131658. Consequently, we then investigated the putative connection between nucleolin and vRNP traffic, notably in regard to a previous study that identified nucleolin as a possible interaction partner of reconstituted IAV vRNPs, without further exploring the functional significance of this interaction7. Interestingly, some functional interactions have been described in other viral models, such as feline calicivirus (FCV) and Norwalk virus (NV), in which infections also result in a relocalization of nucleolin from nucleoli to nucleoplasm and the perinuclear area. In this context, nucleolin was shown to act as a positive regulator of viral replication by forming RNP complexes with viral RNA and interacting with the viral NS6/7 proteins54.",

Chase and collaborators proposed that association between vRNPs and export machinery occurs in dense chromatin domains, where RCC1 exchanges GDP for GTP to produce export energy. They suggested that IAV gain preferential access to host nuclear export machinery by targeting vRNP export complexes to chromatin-dense territories which confer a physical proximity to the sites of Ran regeneration13. Our results support the model proposed by Chase and collaborators and also suggest the requirement of nucleolin in the close association between vRNPs and the host chromatin (Fig. 6A). Indeed, by subnuclear fractionation, we observed a strong accumulation of nucleolin within the condensed chromatin domain (ch500 fraction), which is targeted by vRNPs at 24 hpi.

Indeed, nucleolin is known to induce chromatin de-condensation by binding to histone H172 and thus has a function analogous to the family of high-mobility-group (HMG) proteins. In this context, the nucleolin-H1 interaction could cooperate to reorganize cellular chromatin in order to facilitate its efficient targeting by vRNPs. By interacting with NP, the main component of vRNPs, nucleolin would thus constitute a key mediator in the vRNP nuclear export (Fig. 6A). Alternatively and in regards to RNase sensitivity assay, nucleolin most probably also interacts with non-vRNP form of NP during infection, which could incidentally have an impact on several other steps of viral cycle, as well, including vRNP assembly and/or trafficking.",

This representation was used to define the limit of the nucleus staining (DAPI). Volume rendering visualization technique was used to simulate the casting of light rays through the volume and give a 3D impression of the stained structure.",
