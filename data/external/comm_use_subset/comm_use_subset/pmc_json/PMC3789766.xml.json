            "text": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), discovered in the 1990s, are proteins that lack a stable three-dimensional native structure under physiological conditions [1]\u2013[5]. IDPs are sometimes described as \u201cprotein clouds\u201d because of their structural flexibility and dynamic conformation ensemble [6]. Various bioinformatics methods have been developed to predict IDPs based on their sequences [7], [8]. It was revealed that IDPs are abundant in all kingdoms of life; for example, more than 40% of the proteins in eukaryotic cells possess disordered regions longer than 50 residues [9], [10]. Because of the flexibility of the chain and the resulting advantages in protein-protein interactions [1], [11], [12], IDPs play important roles in various critical physiological processes such as the regulation of transcription and translation [2], cellular signal transmission, protein phosphorylation and molecular assemblies [3], [13], [14]. On the other hand, IDPs also have some adverse effects. It was revealed that many IDPs are associated with human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, amyloidosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes [15]. It was also reported that the Swiss-Prot keywords for eleven severe diseases are strongly correlated with IDPs [16]. Given their abundance and their biological importance, IDPs are regarded as promising and potential drug targets [15], [17]\u2013[19].",

            "text": "Compared with rational drug design targeting ordered proteins [20]\u2013[22], drug design targeting IDPs is still in its infancy. Though some general strategies have been proposed [23], most of the studies [24]\u2013[30] have been limited to only a few systems, namely, p53-MDM2, EWS-FLI1 and c-Myc-Max. Among them, the oncoprotein c-Myc is an encouraging example. C-Myc is a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain which becomes active by forming a dimer with its partner protein Max [31]. In their unbound forms, both c-Myc and Max are disordered. However, in the dimerized forms, they undergo coupled folding and binding. In most cancers cells, c-Myc protein is expressed persistently by a mutated Myc gene, causing its unregulated expression in cell proliferation and signal transmission. Therefore, inhibiting either the overexpression of c-Myc and/or its dimerization with Max may provide a therapy for cancer. Yin et al. [30] have used high-throughput experimental screening to successfully identify seven compounds that inhibit dimerization between c-Myc and Max. Further biophysical studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence assays have verified three different binding sites (residues 366\u2013375, 374\u2013385, and 402\u2013409) in the bHLHZip domain of c-Myc [28]. These binding sites contain several successive residues that can independently bind different small molecules [28]\u2013[30]. It should be noted that, after binding with the small molecule inhibitors, the c-Myc sequence remains disordered, making the detailed experimental characterization of the molecular interactions almost impossible. Therefore, the inhibition mechanism is still unclear. For example, a recent study using drift-time ion mobility mass spectrometry suggested that the binding between c-Myc and these inhibitors is not as specific as previously thought [32]. The lack of conformation data also hampers the application of the well-developed structure-based drug design approach to optimize the inhibition.",

            "text": "Molecular simulations are useful in understanding the characteristics of IDPs because they can provide an atomic description of molecular interactions. Coarse-grained models [11], [33]\u2013[35] and all-atom simulation [36]\u2013[42] have both been used to investigate IDPs. Recently, Knott and Best [40] used large-scale replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations with a well-parameterized force field to obtain a conformational ensemble of the nuclear coactivator binding domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP. Their simulation results were in good agreement with NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, validating the efficacy of all-atom simulations in exploring the highly dynamic conformations of IDPs. For the c-Myc/inhibitor complex described above, Michel and Cuchillo [43] built a structural ensemble using all-atom simulations for c-Myc402\u2013412 with and without an inhibitor (10058-F4) and found that 10058-F4 bound to multiple distinct binding sites and interacted with c-Myc402\u2013412. However, because the c-Myc segment used in their simulation contained only the 11 residues that covered the binding sites of 10058-F4 (residues 402\u2013409), it is unclear how the inhibitors would interact with longer segments of c-Myc and how specific the interaction would be.",

First, we performed implicit-solvent REMD simulations to clarify the conformational features of the unbound c-Myc370\u2013409. Next, we performed MD simulations with an explicit water model to explore in detail the interactions between c-Myc370\u2013409 and 10074-A4. Finally, a negative control using a different peptide segment (c-Myc410\u2013437) was simulated to address the issue of interaction specificity. The conformational ensemble that we obtained will be useful not only in clarifying the structural features of c-Myc and the binding mechanism with inhibitors, but also in providing reference structures for drug design targeting c-Myc via structure-based approaches.",

The conformational properties of c-Myc370\u2013409 in its bound state (with 10074-A4) and more dynamic unbound state, have been studied experimentally using CD and NMR spectroscopy, and a likely average conformation was built based on chemical shift data which is not meant to (and cannot) define detailed structural features [28].

            "text": "To assess the sampling quality of the REMD simulations, we computed 1H and 13C chemical shifts from the simulated conformational ensemble using SHIFTS [46] and compared the computed values with the experiment values (Figure 1). The agreement is reasonable, though not excellent. Deviations between the average chemical shift values for a simulated ensemble and experimental values have been observed previously in several studies on IDPs [40], [47], [48]. The chemical shift calculation performed using several other software (SHIFTX [49], CamShift [50], SPARTA+ [51]) also showed deviations between the computed and experimental values (Figure S1). A possible reason is that chemical shifts are difficult to calculate accurately and the underlying parameterizations applied in current software for the calculation of chemical shifts have been optimized for ordered proteins but not for IDPs [47]. Interestingly, when we back-calculated chemical shifts from the NMR-refined structure using either the SHIFTS [46] or SHIFTX [49] software, the resulting values also deviated from the experimental ones (Figure S2). In addition, the ensemble nature of IDP conformations suggests that the chemical shifts of IDPs should be described as a distribution, and not merely as average values. The calculated distributions of the H\u03b1 chemical shifts obtained from our simulations are summarized in Figure 2. All the H\u03b1 chemical shifts are distributed over a broad range. The experimental values, indicated by arrows in Figure 2, are located close to the centers of the distributions, indicating the validity of the conformational sampling. Data for the HN, C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 chemical shifts are given in Figure S3, showing similar behaviors as the H\u03b1 chemical shifts. We also computed the distribution of the backbone dihedral angles (Ramachandran (\u03c6,\u03c8) plot) for the simulations and the dihedral angles of the NMR-refined apo structure lie well within the simulation distributions (Figure S4).",

However, the sheet content of the simulated structures was much lower than the sheet content of the experimental structures. In a previous study [43] on a shorter c-Myc segment, c-Myc402\u2013412, a similar underestimation of sheet content was observed in the simulated structures. The deficiency of sheet content in the simulated structures might be caused by a bias in the force fields. Although c-Myc370\u2013409 is intrinsically disordered, it possesses a high content of residual helical structure (>25%).

They are all somewhat collapsed compared to the fully extended structure and possess a rich residual helical structure. These states with considerable population will be useful references for rational drug design targeting c-Myc. The existence of residual structure may be related to the functional misfolding that prevents IDPs from unwanted interactions with non-native partners [55]. A quantitative analysis on the distributions of dimension and helix content was provided in Figure S5. The mean radius of gyration is around 10.3\u00b10.6 \u00c5, which is much smaller than the expected value of random coils (18.5 \u00c5) under the same chain length.

The Lennard-Jones interaction matrix was rather weak (Figure S6A), indicating that the conformations were disordered and that the packing in the collapsed structures was poor. This finding is consistent with the contact map, which showed that residue-residue contacts were dispersed and low in magnitude (Figure S6B). The electrostatic interactions, on the other hand, were comparatively strong (Figure S6C), probably because nearly one-third of the residues in c-Myc370\u2013409 (12 out of the 40) are charged residues. The favorable electrostatic interactions of the Arg372, Arg378, Lys389, Lys392 and Lys398 residues with the Asp379, Glu383, Glu385 and Glu409 residues (Figure S6C) are the result of the electrostatic attraction between residues with opposite charges.

It is clear that both the apo and the holo peptides have a rather broad conformation distribution, which is typical of disordered proteins. Upon binding to the ligand 10074-A4, the conformational distribution became more condensed. The top eight conformation clusters of the holo peptide were more highly populated compared to that of the apo peptide, with a total of about 77% occupancy compared to 50%. Similar to the apo c-Myc370\u2013409 structure, the holo c-Myc370\u2013409 structure is rich in helical structures. A quantitative analysis indicated that the helix and polyproline II content was almost unaffected by the binding of 10074-A4 (Figure S11), while the sheet content was enhanced (see also in Figure 7). The electrostatic interactions (from both charged residues and hydrogen bonding) dominated the intramolecular stabilizing force for holo c-Myc370\u2013409 (Figure S12).",

The binding sites were determined as a function of time and representative conformations are shown in Figure 8. Binding of the 10074-A4 ligand was not restricted to a single site in c-Myc370\u2013409, instead, it spread across almost the whole chain of c-Myc370\u2013409. 10074-A4 usually binds simultaneously to two or more regions that are flanked by several residues.

Site I was near the N-terminal and showed stronger potency than that of the other two sites. This result was supported by the intermolecular interaction analysis (Figure 10), which showed that both the electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions for site I were much stronger than those of the other two sites. In fact, in the latter cases, hydrogen bonds hardly formed and the electrostatic interactions were weak. Site I was similar to the experimentally determined binding site of 10074-A4 on c-Myc at residues 374\u2013385 [28]. Binding at all the other sites generated in our simulations was much weaker, which would make them difficult to be observed experimentally. The low residue interaction specificity that we observed in the simulations is consistent with a recent simulation on an 11 residue peptide of c-Myc402\u2013412 that suggested that ligand binding was driven by weak and nonspecific interactions [43]. The mass spectrometry experiment on c-Myc reported by Harvey et al. [32] also supported this conclusion.",

To clarify the nature of this unexpected finding, we calculated the relative binding free energy using the MM/PBSA method and the results are provided in Table 1. We found that the binding of 10074-A4 with c-Myc410\u2013437 was much weaker than with c-Myc370\u2013409; the difference in binding free energy was about 3.4 kcal/mol.

Although 10074-A4 scattered around the c-Myc370\u2013409 and c-Myc410\u2013437 peptides (Figures 8 and 11), its interaction with c-Myc370\u2013409 was stronger and more selective than with c-Myc410\u2013437.

The conformational space was found to be rather dispersed. In contrast to conventional structured proteins, the conformations of c-Myc370\u2013409 were mainly stabilized by charge interactions and hydrogen bonds. Upon binding to 10074-A4, c-Myc370\u2013409 remained disordered. The 10074-A4 ligand bound at different sites throughout the c-Myc370\u2013409 chain with different strength. Accordingly, a ligand cloud concept was proposed, that is, the interactions between small molecule ligands and IDPs were like ligand clouds around protein clouds. The different binding probabilities between the protein clouds and ligand clouds indicated that the ligand could be selective and thus specific. Though the specificity of the binding was not high, the binding of ligand and non-ligand to the target IDP could be clearly distinguished.",

The system was minimized using the steepest descent minimization approach. After the minimization, the system was equilibrated in the NVT ensemble with all-heavy atom restrained with a force constant of 239 kcal/mol. The temperature was maintained at 300 K using a V-rescale thermostat with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. Further equilibration was carried on in the NPT ensemble without strains, and where the pressure was maintained at 1 atmosphere using a Parrinello-Rahamn barostat with the coupling constant set to 2.0 ps. Both equilibrations were performed for 200 ps with a time step of 1 fs. For the production run, the thermostat and barostat settings were the same as for the NPT run. To enable 2 fs time steps, bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to equilibration length using the LINCS algorithm [68]. A real-space cutoff of 10 \u00c5 was used for the electrostatic and Lennard-Jones forces. Snapshots from each trajectory were stored every 20 ps.",
