IAVs cause seasonal influenza epidemics annually and recurring pandemics with severe consequences for public health and global economy [1], [2]. At least three IAV-pandemics emerged in the last century (1918 A/H1N1, 1957 A/H2N2, and 1968 A/H3N2). The 1918 Spanish flu was the most serious influenza pandemic that killed over 50 million people worldwide [3]. The latter two pandemics, although mild compared to the 1918 incidence, resulted in significant mortality, with close to 2 million and 1 million deaths, respectively [4]. The latest pandemic influenza, and newest global health challenge, occurred in 2009 due to the emergence of an A/H1N1 pandemic IAV (H1N1pdm virus). The H1N1pdm virus has been detected in more than 214 countries and territories and has caused 18,389 deaths as of July 30, 2010 [5].",

The biologically active HA is a homologous trimeric molecule that is attached to the virion membrane through its carboxy terminus [11]. HA plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IAVs. HA mediates IAVs' binding to the cellular receptor N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid as well as the subsequent membrane fusion process [12]. HA also stimulates host protective immunities, specifically the production of neutralizing antibodies. The generation of anti-HA neutralizing antibodies has been the major target for influenza vaccine development [11], [13]. Due to its specificity in immune response, HA is also an important target for IAV subtyping using immunoassays [7], [14].",

Several IAV subtype-specific serological tests have been developed. At present, subtyping of IAV mainly relies on a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using HA and NA subtype-specific reference sera [15]. However, there are a number of drawbacks to HI testing. This assay is 1) relatively laborious; 2) low in sensitivity; 3) requires preparation of antigen from viable viruses which are potentially hazardous and 4) contains low signal to noise ratio, e.g. the assay exhibits inter-variability and subtype cross-reactivity [16], [17]. Moreover, the HI test can be confounded by steric hindrance from NA antibodies, leading to nonspecific inhibition and misidentification [18].",

ELISA assays based on epitopes that are highly conserved and specific for one certain HA subtype will be useful for rapid and simple subtyping of IAVs. Such epitopes in IAVs have not been fully addressed although many studies have been performed. In the present study, we report the successful identification of a new epitope, which is highly conserved among the majority of IAV strains of H1 subtype. Moreover, we developed an ELISA assay for H1 antibody subtyping based on this epitope. Results derived from this new assay correlate with results obtained through the use of HI test.",

A set of 50 peptides with five residues overlapping with the adjacent peptides spanning the ectodomain sequences of the HA protein of the H1N1pdm virus strain A/California/04/2009 were synthesized. The binding between these peptides and the convalescent serum samples from 11 H1N1pdm patients were examined by ELISA using these peptides as coating antigens. Five of these peptides (P3, P5, P15, P16 and P31) were found to react well with the sera tested. These peptides corresponded to the sequences of amino acid (aa) residues 38\u201352, 58\u201372, 158\u2013172, 168\u2013182, and 318\u2013332 in the HA molecule, respectively (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Among them, the P3 peptide reacted with 54.5% (6/11) of the sera, the P15 and P16 peptides reacted with 81.8% (9/11) of the sera, while the P5 and P31 peptides reacted with 100% (11/11) of the sera. These data indicated that these peptides may contain H1N1pdm virus B cell epitopes.",

As shown in Fig. 5, antibody induced by the P5-KLH conjugate was inhibited by peptide N10\u2013N14 and the parental peptide P5 to similar extents, whereas peptides N6\u2013N9 only showed inefficient inhibition even at high molar concentrations. A similar pattern of inhibition was observed with the C-terminal conservative derivatives. Peptides C12, C13, C14, and the parent peptide P5 demonstrated comparable and efficient inhibition, whereas only slight inhibition was observed in peptides C6\u2013C11 (Fig. 5B). Since the amino acid sequence LRGVAPL overlapped both peptides N10 and C12 (Fig. 5), we speculate that this sequence met the minimum requirements of binding to the anti-P5 antibody. However, the synthetic peptide LRGVAPL did not block the binding between P5 peptide and its antibody, nor did it directly bind to the P5 antibody (Fig. 6). As P5 exhibited the highest reactivities in the ELISA compared with the derived shorter peptides, we used P5 for further experimentations.",

            "text": "IAV escapes the human immune system by continuous antigenic drifts and occasional antigenic shifts [33]. Attempts to develop universal vaccines and reliable diagnostic tools based on conserved epitopes of IAV are big challenges. Several epitopes that can elicit broad spectrum neutralizing antibodies have been identified recently. For example, Sui et al. identified a universal neutralizing epitope for group 1 HA [34]. Yoshida et al. reported a universal epitope in antigenic site B shared by H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13 subtypes [35]. All these epitopes are conformation-dependent. In this study, we identified two epitopes (P5 and P31) which have not been identified previously (Fig. S1). The P5 (aa58\u201372) seems to be a dispatch that links the stem region and the globular region and is fully exposed on the surface, while P31 (aa 318\u2013332d) is located in the middle of helix A and B on HA2. In contrast to previous studies, we found P5 to be a linear B cell epitope. Our data demonstrate that this epitope is highly conserved among H1 viruses (9860/10767, 91.6%). Because viral mutants that are resistant to conformational epitopes are more easily generated, the conserved linear epitope is more suitable for differentiating subtypes than conformational epitopes [33]. Hence, the epitope in P5 provides a new target for reliable diagnostics of H1-subtype IAVs.",

However, we found that the full-length P5 (15 aa in length) rather than truncated peptides showed strongest binding to the corresponding antibody (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). As peptides N10 and C12 are the shortest truncated P5 that can bind to anti-P5 antibody and share a core sequence of LRGVAPL, we tested whether this sequence could be the epitope. However, the synthetic peptide LRGVAPL did not block P5-antibody interactions nor bind P5 antibody (Fig. 6).

The former program was used to define the number of total sequences in HA proteins according to the Subtype parameter (H1 or H2\u2013H16). The latter program defined the number of hits (P5 or P31) in the H1 or H2\u2013H16 total sequences. Because there are no standards for evaluating short peptide sequence homology, we chose the fuzzy match analysis to represent the identical level of a peptide sequence to HA proteins. The analysis type was chosen as fuzzy match, which meant >50% of characters were identical to the searched aa string. For example, entering GILGFVFTL may also find AILGFVFTI but not ALIGFVFSI.",
