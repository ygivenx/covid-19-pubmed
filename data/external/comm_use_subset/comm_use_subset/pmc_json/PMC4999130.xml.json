PEDV causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), characterized by severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and significant mortality in suckling piglets [1\u20133]. The genome is approximately 28,000 bp and encodes at least seven open reading frames (ORFs), including the replicase polyproteins 1a and 1b, ORF3, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [4,5]. PED was first reported in Belgium at the United Kingdom in 1971 [6] and subsequently detected in many European and Asian countries [7\u201310]. Large outbreaks of PED caused by a PEDV variant strain in Chinese swine farms have caused large economic losses [11\u201313]. In 2013, a PEDV variant emerged and negatively impacted the United States swine industry [14\u201316].",

Activation of PI3K by cytokines, growth factors, or virus binding to cell surface receptors leads to the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits Akt to the plasma membrane and activates Akt by phosphorylation [20]. Activated Akt induces the phosphorylation of numerous signaling proteins, including FoxO1, p53, mTOR, Bad, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) [21\u201325]. The PI3K/Akt pathway affects the replication of many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, reovirus, herpesvirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [23,24,26\u201330].",

GSK-3\u03b1and GSK-3\u03b2are the two isoforms of the GSK-3 [31]. Unlike most proteinkinases, GSK-3 is actived in unstimulated resting cells and the activation of which is negatively regulated by phosphorylation [32]. The phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b1(on Ser21) and GSK-3\u03b2(on Ser 9) is mediated by Akt [33], P70S6K [34], p90RSK [35], PKC isoforms [36], and PKA [37]. GSK-3 plays an important role in regulating innate immune responses by regulating the activity of transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, NFAT and STATs [38\u201340]. In innate immune cells, GSK-3 augments the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppresses anti-inflammatory cytokine production [38]. In the present study, we found that PEDV activated the PI3K/Akt pathway in Vero cells and that blocking PI3K activation promoted PEDV replication. Phosphorylation of GSK-3 a downstream target of PI3K/Akt, was increased by PEDV infection and blocking GSK-3 phosphorylation enhanced PEDV replication.",

The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays an important role in cell survival and virus replication. A previous report showed that PRRSV and UV-PRRSV induce early transient Akt activation in porcine alveolar macrophages and Marc-145 cells to facilitate virus entry [28]. The vaccinia mature virus infected Hela cells triggers the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, and inhibited the PI3K activation reducing virus entry in an integrin \u03b21-dependent manner [44]. Another report showed that the influenza A virus NS1 protein activates the PI3K/Akt pathway by direct interaction [45]. Our study observed that PEDV stimulated the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in Vero cells at both the early (5\u201315 min p.i.) and late (6\u201310 h p.i.) stage (Fig 1B). We also found that akt phosphorylation was also enhanced by UV-inactivated PEDV (Fig 1C). Taking these findings together, we conclude that PI3K/Akt pathway could be activated in virus replication and virus invasion. It could be that PI3K/Akt activation not only triggered dependent upon virus replication-competent particles but also triggered by PEDV-host receptor interactions.",

Some studies have reported that the phosphorylation of mTOR and Bad regulate cell survival and effect virus infection. The expression of p53 was induced by PI3K/Akt pathway after reovirus infection and inhibited virus replication [24]. GSK-3 regulates innate immune responses, transcription factors, and cytokine expression [47,49\u201351]. We found both that PEDV affected GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2phosphorylation in late stages of infection (Fig 3) and the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2 was regulated by Akt. Inhibited GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2 phosphorylation increased PEDV replication in Vero cells (Fig 4). The precise molecular mechanism by which GSK-3 regulates PEDV replication requires further investigation.",
