Egg-shell formation takes place in the isthmus and shell gland regions, where the former contributes only to shell membrane formation. Egg formation involves the production of steroid hormones, which regulate the proliferation and growth of oviducal epithelial cells throughout the oviduct. For example, the administration of estrogen and/or progesterone leads to massive growth of the epithelia in the oviduct of juvenile hens [1\u20133]. An egg is composed of egg internal contents and egg-shell. Among the internal contents, albumen is secreted by the magnum and is composed mainly of ovalbumin, muco-proteins and globulins [4]. The shell membranes are synthesized in the isthmus region of the oviduct and contain collagen proteins in its composition [5]. Egg-shell synthesis occurs in the shell gland and is composed mainly of calcium carbonate [6] and shell matrix proteins, such as the ovocalyxin family [5].",

            "text": "Mitochondrion acts as a powerhouse of the cell, where it plays a vital role in cellular metabolism, calcium handling, heme biosynthesis, cell differentiation, apoptosis and aging [7\u20139]. Mitochondrial count in a cell varies in different cell types [10, 11], different organs, the sex and age of an organism [12, 13] and physiological and disease conditions [10, 14]. A higher mitochondrial respiratory capacity and mitochondrial counts have been recorded in more physically active humans [15, 16]. Similarly, increases in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been observed during myogenesis in rats [17] and in brown adipocytes of various mammals in response to low temperature [18]. During the cell cycle, mitochondria undergo changes in shape, count and location; however, it is not known how quickly mitochondria divide in metabolically active and inactive cells. In the reproductive track of laying chickens, it is unclear how mitochondria respond to the need of the cells for ATP by either inducing mitochondrial division or accelerating mitochondrial function without division. Cells can respond to alterations in mitochondrial function by up- or down-regulations in the expression of nuclear-DNA encoded gene [19]. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) encodes a protein that in conjunction with nuclear-DNA polymerase \u03b3 (POL\u03b3A) control mtDNA replication in a cell [20, 21]. mtDNA replication machinery synthesizes different proteins that include the single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB), the catalytic subunit of DNA POL\u03b3A and processivity factor, the mitochondrial RNA polymerase and the mitochondrial replicative helicase TWINKLE [22, 23]. Dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1 also called DNM1L) is the main regulator of mitochondrial division in a cell, which is oligomerized by mitochondrial division protein 1 (Mdv1) bound to the outer membrane of mitochondria via Mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1) [24\u201327]. Nuclear genome of the cell encodes proteins essential for mtDNA maintenance and replication [23]. The synthesised proteins are translocated into the mitochondria after their packaging in the cytoplasm. Therefore, expression of genes coded by mtDNA and nuclear genomes are accurately coordinated for regulating the electron transport linked phosphorylation capacity in response to changes in physiological demands of cells [28]. Studies in a single celled green algae (chlorella) [29], HeLa cells (strain- F315) [30] and the opportunistic pathogenic dimorphic yeast (Candida albicans) [31] indicate that increase in total mitochondrial count per cell occurs continuously during the cell cycle. This increase in mitochondrial counts is usually positively correlated with the increase in cell volume. In HeLa and dimorphic yeast cells, mitochondrial count is comprised of approximately 10% of the total cell volume while, in algae, this value is about 3% but is constant throughout cell division [29\u201331].",

In mammals, the CS gene has been used extensively as a marker for intact mitochondrial density [33\u201335]; however, its role has been questioned in studies of developmental stages [36], age of animal [37] and physical activity [38]. CS has been shown to be positively correlated with acute exercise activities in mammalian muscles [39, 40]. Succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A (SDHA) gene, encodes a major catalytic subunit of succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, a complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. SDHA gene provides instructions for synthesizing one of four parts (subunits) of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme. SDH then participates in both the electron transport chain and the Krebs cycle. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1\u03b1/PPARGC1A) is the master regulator in mitochondrial division [41]. In vitro studies in muscle cells [42], C2C12 myoblasts [43] or in mice cardiac myocytes [44] have shown that PGC-1\u03b1 is capable of activating the expression of a cascade of genes involved in mitochondrial synthesis and respiratory function in different types of cells. Therefore, PGC-1\u03b1 is mainly involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Cytochrome C somatic (CYC, S) gene encodes cytochrome C enzyme that plays a role in the electron transport chain complex in mitochondria and during apoptosis. Na+-K+\nATPase gene encodes an enzyme that is an integral membrane protein which consists of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits [45]. This enzyme plays an essential role in maintaining the transmembrane gradient of Na+ and K+ ions in cells [46].",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious avian mucosal pathogen that not only affects layer and broiler chickens but also other avian species worldwide [47]. Similar to other coronaviruses, IBV is composed of a small membrane protein (E), the integral membrane protein (M), the nucleoprotein (N) and the spike glycoprotein (S) [48, 49]. The S protein is composed of two subunits, the S1 (head) and the S2 (stalk) that is responsible for binding to the target cell receptor in host [50, 51], while the N protein induces cell mediated immunity [52]. There is not much information about whether IBV entry and fusion to host cells occurs following endocytosis or at the cell membrane [51, 53]. Host cell neutral pH is considered lethal for fusion of the virus particle [54]. Among other host cell surface receptors, sialic acid has been shown to act as a receptor for binding of IBV spike proteins in respiratory, kidney and oviduct epithelia [55\u201358]. IBV can infect any age of birds; however, the mortality is higher in very young chicks compared with older birds [59]. Mortality rates depend upon viral strain, birds age and immune status of the bird [60]. Among all the field strains of Australian IBV, T (N1/62) is considered the most virulent in inducing pathological changes in the tracheal, kidney and oviduct epithelia of laying hens. Infection with IBV in the oviduct leads to various degrees of pathogenesis in the oviduct and reduction in egg production [61\u201365].",

To check the amplification efficiencies for the standard curve construction of GAPDH and ND4, qPCR was run on the recombinant plasmid DNA (10\u2212 2~10\u2212 8) in a 20 \u03bcL PCR reaction. The master-mix preparation and qPCR cycling conditions were as per the protocol of the SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX Kit (Bioline, Australia). For standard curve construction, eight different serial dilutions (10\u2212 2~10\u2212 9) of the recombinant plasmid DNA were prepared and qPCR amplified. To construct the standard curves for GAPDH and ND4, quantification cycles (Cq) were plotted against log10 copy number of plasmids calculated according to the molecular weight of recombinant plasmids [71]. The amplified PCR products were sequenced by the Australian Genome Research Facility, Australia for confirmation of GAPDH and ND4 fragment inserts into the plasmid vector.",

A significantly lower mitochondrial count in the shell gland of challenged hens suggests that the virus had a greater effect on this region, as compared with the isthmus and magnum segments of the oviduct. A greater severity of pathological lesions caused by IBV T in the isthmus and shell gland segments, compared with the magnum, has been reported [77]. The data presented here showed that IBV T infection significantly reduced the mean mitochondrial count only in the shell gland tissue of oviduct. Although the virus seemed to have caused more effects in the shell gland, the reduced mitochondrial count could not be correlated with the expression levels of most of the genes studied except for SDHA. It is possible that virus multiplication in the shell gland tissue might compromise the pathways involving the synthesis of SDHA protein. Generally, viral replication alters mitochondrial permeability transition pore, oxidative balance, mitochondrial membrane potential, electron transport and energy production at the cellular level [78]. It is not clear how IBV T challenge led to the reduction of mitochondrial counts in the cells; however, in previous studies, degenerated mitochondria in IBV infected cells of shell gland tissue of laying hens have been recorded [64]. In the current study, it seems that the viral load in the shell gland tissue was very low at days 9\u201310 p.i. and therefore was not detectable in the shell gland tissue containing all tissue layers. However, the mean viral load was 3.55 \u00d7 106 copies per gram in the epithelial mucosa (epithelial scrapings) of the shell gland region of the oviduct, indicating that shell gland had succumbed to viral infection particularly in the epithelial layer.",

The lack of any significant difference in the relative expression levels of all of the genes except SDHA, between the control and IBV T challenged groups, may indicate that mitochondrial function may have been enhanced and thus overall egg quality may not have been affected by fewer mitochondria in the shell gland cells of IBV T infected hens. SDHA functions in mitochondrial complex II, a part of the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. A significantly lower expression level of the SDHA in the infected group correlates with the lower number of mitochondria. However, to confirm this correlation, further research is needed as the remaining genes studied were not affected by the virus challenge. It also seems that the virus effect on the expression level of SDHA was not consistent, as the mRNA was significantly lower in the virus challenge group at the 5 h but not the 15 h time-point. CS enzyme activity has been widely used as a marker for intact mitochondrial density. The activity of CS was 42% higher in the leg muscle of dominant versus subordinate male red jungle fowl, with no differences in overall muscle mass [79]. In the current study, there was a significantly higher level of CS mRNA at the 15 h time-point implying that mitochondrial density was higher at this time-point; however, this was not the case as the mitochondrial counts were not significantly different between the 5 and 15 h time-points of egg-shell formation. The protein encoded by the CS gene is a Krebs cycle enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of citrate from acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate. The temporal relationships between mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression level of the genes are not clear and thus it is difficult to relate directly the expression level of such genes with mitochondrial counts at different time-points of egg-shell formation.",

In mammals, the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 is prominent in tissues with high demands for energy [81, 82] and the mRNA level is induced in conditions such as physical exercise, fasting and exposure to cold [82]. Increase in PGC-1\u03b1 protein is sufficient to induce cellular pathways important for mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism [43, 44]. Mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity are different in different cells and are regulated by energy demand of a cell [83]. In a study of adenovirus infected SAOS-2 cells, the mitochondrial proteins induced by PGC-1\u03b1 regulation resulted in increased mitochondrial content in the cells [83] measured 48 h after infection. In the current study, the expression level of PGC-1\u03b1 was not affected by viral infection and time-points of egg-shell formation. The expression level of PGC-1\u03b1 cannot be correlated with mitochondrial counts as the virus challenge reduced the mitochondria at both 5 and 15 h time-points of egg-shell formation. It seems that a lower number of mitochondria may not necessarily induce the up-regulation of PGC-1\u03b1 in cells undergoing virus multiplication. Drp1 is a nuclear encoded protein that plays an important role in the fission of the outer mitochondrial membrane. In healthy cells, fission and fusion events occur to regulate mitochondrial morphology [84]. Once again, the higher expression level of Drp1 at 15 h compared with the 5 h time-point cannot be clearly linked with higher activities of mitochondrial fission and/or fusion as most of the genes studied did not show a clear pattern of change with lower mean mitochondrial counts in IBV T challenged groups. Also, the mitochondrial counts were significantly lower at both 5 and 15 h time-points in the challenge groups, whereas no expression change of Drp1 was observed upon virus challenge during egg-shell formation. This suggests that having a lower number of mitochondria in a cell may not necessarily relate to the expression level of Drp1. We consider that a spatio-temporal investigation is needed to understand the response of nuclear DNA encoded genes to mitochondrial biogenesis and fission in cells undergoing virus multiplication possibly through immunohistochemistry assays.",

Na+-K+\nATPase is involved in maintaining membrane excitation potential, tight junction polarity and vectorial transport in cells (reviewed in Rajasekaran et al., [85]). A higher expression level of Na+-K+\nATPase at 15 h compared with the 5 h time-point is an indication of higher cellular activity of the shell gland tissue during the formation of the egg-shell. A lack of significant difference in the expression level of Na+-K+\nATPase between the control and IBV T challenged groups indicates that viral multiplication in the cells did not alter the normal function of Na+-K+\nATPase and that the cells in both the groups were functioning similarly. However, an interaction of time-point and virus challenge indicated that the expression level of Na+-K+\nATPase was significantly affected by viral multiplication when the egg-shell formation was at its peak in the shell gland. A significant interaction between the time-point and virus challenge for SDHA and Na+-K+\nATPase indicates that the virus challenge downregulates these genes only at certain stages of egg-shell formation when the expression of the genes is high, at 5 h for SDHA but at 15 h for Na+-K+\nATPase.",

Furthermore, the expression levels of the nuclear DNA encoded genes that are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and/or function could not be clearly correlated with lower mean mitochondrial count and mitochondrial biogenesis. A significant difference in the expression levels of most of the genes at two different time-points of egg-shell formation showed that the mitochondrial function was more affected by egg-shell formation stages than by the viral multiplication in the cells. Further investigation is required to determine the actual turnover of mitochondria in metabolically active organs, such as laying hen oviduct, in normal and pathological conditions, and spatio-temporal relationship between mitochondrial count and expression of genes coding mitochondrial biogenesis related proteins.",
