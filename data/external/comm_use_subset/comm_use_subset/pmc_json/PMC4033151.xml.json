The striking features of the disease were an initial encephalitic presentation followed by a rapidly fatal destructive alveolar pneumonia, alarming experienced clinicians. Between April and July 2012 a total of 78 children were affected, 54 of whom died. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) was identified as the causative organism, possibly aggravated by malnutrition and uncontrolled use of steroids.1 EV71 is one of the pathogens associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). It was responsible for large HFMD outbreaks in Taiwan (1.5 million cases) and Malaysia (Sarawak, 2628 cases) in the late 1990s. In 2008 and 2011 large outbreaks were also described in China (490 000 cases) and Vietnam (110 000 cases).2 The recent Cambodian outbreak further demonstrates the emergence and spread of serious EV71 related disease in the South-East Asian region over the last two decades.",

            "text": "Humans are the only known hosts for HFMD associated EV infections. EVs are non-enveloped viruses and are therefore highly resistant to environmental conditions, and also to mild disinfectants. Transmission is thought to occur primarily through the faecal-oral route, although virus has also been detected in respiratory secretions and in skin lesions. Incubation time is reported to be between 3 days and 6 days, that is, shorter than for poliomyelitis, which has a typical incubation period of 9\u201312 days. Initial viral replication is presumed to occur in the lymphoid tissues of the oropharyngeal cavity (tonsils) and small bowel (Peyer's patches), giving rise to a mild viraemia. Most infections are successfully controlled at this point and remain asymptomatic. Further dissemination of EVs to the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes), skin and mucous membranes coincides with the onset of clinical symptoms. EV71 can invade central parts of the brain, possibly by retrograde axonal transport. Patients with central nervous system involvement typically present with features of brainstem encephalitis, including myoclonus and autonomic dysregulation (hypertension, tachycardia). A small proportion of these patients may progress to develop cardiopulmonary failure, which may be fatal. The mechanisms underlying the cardiopulmonary failure are thought to be neurogenic in origin, with disproportionate sympathetic stimulation and catecholamine secretion directly affecting the cardiac muscle and raising pulmonary pressures. MRI of the brain suggests typical involvement of the medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain and spinal cord, that resolves within 2 months in most cases.6 A prospective study of 730 children admitted with HFMD in Sarawak found high fever, fever for more than 3 days and lethargy as risk factors for central nervous system involvement.11 However the positive predictive values for these risk factors were relatively low, resulting in high numbers of hospitalisations for relatively mild disease.",

IVIG is widely used, particularly in Vietnam; it is a very costly intervention with potential risks, and currently there is no evidence to support its use. Milrinone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases with cardiopulmonary collapse through a small randomised controlled open-label trial.16 It is believed that controlling autonomic dysfunction may avoid progression of disease to cardiopulmonary failure. One novel therapy under investigation is intravenous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate, long used in the management of pre-eclampsia, promotes cardiovascular stability through a combination of vasodilatation and negative chronotropicity. It also inhibits catecholamine release, and may reduce autonomic dysfunction in tetanus.17\n18 A randomised placebo controlled trial of magnesium sulfate in children with autonomic dysfunction is in progress in Vietnam to address the potential benefit of this cheap, accessible therapy. (Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01940250.) The WHO Western Pacific Region Office provides updates on HFMD cases notified through local public health systems in Japan, Singapore, China, Vietnam, The Philippines and Thailand.2 Outbreak control measures are targeted at interrupting virus transmission from person to person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces (such as toys) or fomites. Therefore health education messages focus on personal hygiene and good sanitation, including recommendations for frequent hand washing, proper disposal of soiled diapers and regular disinfection of soiled surfaces. The transmission of EVs is most efficient in crowded settings, and therefore during outbreaks most countries in the region have adopted social distancing measures, such as closures of childcare facilities and schools and cancellation of public functions involving children. Little systematic research has been done to assess the effectiveness of such measures, but one study from Singapore seemed to show some benefit.19 However, the optimal timing for implementation of these measures is unclear\u2014early, as soon as a HFMD is reported, or later following confirmation of EV71 as the causative agent. In addition, the effectiveness of distancing measures, which have substantial socioeconomic implications, is uncertain. If EV71 is like other directly transmissible viruses, such controls may decrease the peak incidence of disease during an outbreak/epidemic, and blunt the burden on the healthcare system, which can be of great value. However, it could thereby also prolong the outbreak and the total numbers would be similar. In addition, school closure could cause relocation to other geographical areas.6",

Vaccine development has progressed but routine use is still distant. Monitoring viral genetic and antigenic evolution, cross protection and waning of immunity will inform vaccine development and implementation. Public health interventions should be based on understanding transmission chains of EVs, and the duration of viral shedding. There is an urgent need to identify early clinical predictors of severe disease. Countries currently affected typically have frail health infrastructures which can easily be overburdened by outbreaks. Costly interventions already implemented have not been clearly evaluated. Severe HFMD occurs at a time of rapid brain development. Concerns over long-tem outcomes have not been prospectively evaluated.
