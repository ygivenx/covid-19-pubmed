This dataset derived from the 1000 Genomes Project contains nearly 7.5 times more common SNPs and low-frequency variants than those present in release 22 of Hapmap project (296 SNPs vs. 40 SNPs), including a much larger fraction of variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 (154 vs. 0), with 0.01 < MAF < 0.05 (28 vs. 3), and with MAF > 0.05 (114 vs. 37).

We only found one recurrent low-frequency non-silent variation (rs148467625) in this region, a nonsynonymous Isoleucine to Threonine change at residue 88 in exon 1. Reanalyzing the genotype data of the 1000 Genomes Project showed that the frequency of rs148467625 is low in the Southern Han Chinese population (MAF = 0.015), and this SNP may not exist in the Northern Han Chinese population and other ethnic populations. We then genotyped rs148467625 in the Sample Set 1 (Methods). The results showed that the MAF of rs148467625 in the Guangxi population is 0.015, similar to it\u2019s MAF in the Southern Han Chinese population of the 1000 Genomes Project and the previous reports2124. We found that this SNP showed no association with risk of persistent HBV infection in the Sample Set 1 (Supplementary Table 6).

To examine the role of CNV encompassing SLC10A1 in the risk of persistent HBV infection, we screened the entire gene in the public database of genomic variants (DGV, http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/), but found no CNVs documented. The nearest CNVs flanking SLC10A1 documented in the DGV database were two deletions with one located 7.4-Kb downstream and the other 14.3-Kb upstream of SLC10A1 (Supplementary Figure 3). We also called CNVs in the Sample Set 2, which contains genome-wide genotyping data, but find no CNVs in SLC10A1 or surrounding regions of 500-Kb in this relatively large dataset. These results suggest that CNV at the SLC10A1 locus does not play an important role in predisposition to persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese.",

Because unexposed subjects remain at risk of acquiring persistent HBV infection, the inclusion of such controls limits the ability to compare frequency of variants in them to that in patients with established persistent HBV infection. Second, most of our HBV persistent carriers and subjects with nature HBV clearance came from systematic screening of HBV markers in large, population-based studies or routine physical examination in local hospitals and was matched on age and sex, which may have reduced potential selection bias. Finally, a relatively large sample size (totally 2,550 cases and 2,124 controls) in this study provided enough statistical power, >90% at significance level of 0.01, to detect an allele with a MAF of 0.20 that confers an additive 1.2-fold effect on disease risk (Supplementary Figure 5).",

Recently, two large cohort studies have reported that the Ser267Phe variant was associated with resistance to HBV infection among Chinese of Guangdong (under multiple models of inheritance) and Taiwan (only under the recessive model), respectively. However, in the present study with large number of participants recruited also in southern China, Ser267Phe was not significantly associated with risk of persistent HBV infection (the lowest P value = 0.031, before adjustment for multiple testing under the recessive model in the pooled population, Supplementary Table 2). Even if Ser267Phe is regarded as a protective factor against persistent HBV infection when considering the marginal association (P = 0.031), the population attributable fraction (PAF) indicated that only 5.5% (95% CI, 0.15\u201339.2%) of the decrease in the risk of persistent HBV infection can be attributed to the protective effect of the Ser/Ser genotype in this study (methods).

Indeed, the allele and genotype frequencies of the SLC10A1 polymorphisms vary with ethnicity. For instance, in the 1068 control subjects of the Sample Set 1 (Southern Chinese), we found that the frequencies of the 267Ser allele and Ser/Ser genotype were 0.10 and 0.0077, while in non-Asian population of the 1000 Genomes Project, the frequency of the 267Ser allele was extremely low, being 0 and 0.0016 in European and African populations, respectively. Furthermore, no 267 Ser alleles were found in more than 6000 non-Asian samples of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (Data release: ESP6500SI-V2, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/).

Genomic locations of genes on the NCBI Build 37 human assembly were adapted from the University of California at Santa Cruz Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). The LD structure surrounding the SLC10A1 gene in Chinese CHB and CHS samples of the 1000 Genomes Project was shown. Shading represents the magnitude and significance of pairwise LD (measured by D\u2032), with a red-to-white gradient reflecting higher to lower LD values.
